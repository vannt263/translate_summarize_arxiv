    "<S> microwave semiconductor devices have had a profound impact on the fields of satellite and ground based communications , radar , and missile guidance,@xcite and related technological developments have fueled motivation for additional basic research on semiconductors such as , for example , the gaas / algaas two - dimensional electron system </S>",
    "<S> . meanwhile , the ever - improving electron mobility in the high mobility gaas / algaas 2des continues to reveal electronic effects induced by microwave and terahertz photo - excitation , such as , for example , the zero - resistance state , without concurrent hall resistance quantization,@xcite observed in the gaas / algaas 2des , when the specimen is subjected to microwave and terahertz photo - excitation in a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental realization of such radiation - induced zero - resistance states , and associated @xmath0-periodic radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations expanded the experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite investigations of transport in the photo - excited 2-dimensional electron system .    </S>",

    "<S> we report strong correlations , which are followed as a function of the microwave power , the microwave frequency , and the applied current . </S>",
    "<S> notably , the character of the reflection signal remains unchanged even when the current is switched off in the gaas / algaas hall bar specimen . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest a perceptible microwave - induced change in the electronic properties of the 2des , even in the absence of an applied current .    </S>",
    "<S> gaas / algaas hall bars were mounted at the end of a long cylindrical waveguide along with a carbon resistor to sense the microwave reflection as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . the carbon sensor exhibits a strong negative temperature coefficient , i.e. , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , sensor heating by microwaves reflected from the 2des produces a reduction in the sensor resistance @xmath2 , which becomes the signature of microwave reflection ( or emission ) . </S>",
    "<S> the waveguide sample holder was inserted into a variable temperature insert in a superconducting solenoid . </S>",
    "<S> a base temperature of approximately @xmath3 k was realized by pumping on the liquid helium within the variable temperature insert . </S>",
    "<S> the 2d electron density @xmath4 @xmath5 and the mobility @xmath6 @xmath7/vs . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the transport lifetime is @xmath8 s and the single particle lifetime @xmath9 s. finally , a low frequency lock - in technique was adopted to detect the electrical signals of interest .    </S>",

    "<S> 1(a ) shows that the sample in the dark , i.e. , without microwave photo - excitation , does not exhibit microwave - radiation - induced magneto - resistance oscillations in @xmath10 , as the fractional change in the reflection detector signal @xmath12 , see fig . </S>",

    "<S> 1(a ) , and @xmath12 conveys an oscillatory reflection . here , the microwave - induced changes in the detector signal @xmath15@xmath16@xmath17 , where @xmath15@xmath11=@xmath18 , @xmath19 is the sensor resistance in the magnetic field , and @xmath20 is the zero - field sensor resistance . to confirm that the microwave induced effect in @xmath12 is due to the microwave response of the high - mobility gaas / algaas specimen , we have also examined low mobility gaas / algaas specimens in the same experimental setup . </S>",
    "<S> the results showed little difference between the photo - excited- and dark- @xmath10 , and also @xmath12 in the low mobility specimen , which is attributed to the absence of radiation - induced oscillations in the low mobility specimen . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the insets of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ( a ) and ( b ) show that where @xmath10 in the high mobility specimen exhibits only shubnikov - de haas oscillations , @xmath11 monotonically decreases as @xmath21 is ncreased , but oscillatory features are not observable .    </S>",

    "<S> the exhibited traces indicate the following features with changing microwave power : i ) the phase of the microwave radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations in @xmath10 does not change with the microwave power , but oscillation amplitude increases with the power , @xmath22 , over the range @xmath25 3.2 mw . </S>",
    "<S> ii)correspondingly , the oscillatory reflection conveyed by @xmath26 t@xmath24 remains in phase for different microwave powers , although the relative amplitude increases with @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the reflection response in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 is not just confined to the vicinity of cyclotron resonance ( @xmath27 tesla ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 examines the current ( @xmath28 ) dependence of @xmath29 and @xmath2 at 35 ghz and @xmath30 mw . here @xmath31 has been plotted rather than @xmath10 because @xmath10 is undefined when @xmath32 @xmath33a . as the applied current , @xmath28 , is decreased from 2.5 @xmath33a to 0 @xmath33a , the diagonal voltage @xmath31 decreases proportionally , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) , as expected . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) exhibits the concurrently measured remotely sensed signal @xmath2 at the same currents , @xmath28 . here , note the insensitivity in the @xmath2 signal to the applied current .    to convey the remarkable feature in this result , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 , we exhibit the @xmath31 vs. @xmath21 and @xmath11 vs. @xmath21 now with 48 ghz microwave excitation at 3.2 mw , with the applied current @xmath34 @xmath33a , in fig . 4(a ) and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(b ) , and @xmath35 @xmath33a in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(c ) and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(d ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the applied current is switched off , the @xmath31 signal vanishes as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the non - monotonic variation in @xmath2 due to the microwave reflection from the photoexcited 2des persists even in the absence of the applied current . </S>",
    "<S> these features indicate that there is a microwave - induced response in the 2des even in the absence of an applied current .    </S>",
    "<S> we provide a brief explanation of the observed features using the theory of lei and liu.@xcite they asserted that , in the presence of impurity and phonon scattering , which couple the c.m . and relative motions , the microwave field affects the relative motion by allowing transitions between different states , leading to radiation - induced magnetoresistance oscillations.@xcite their calculations indicated oscillations in the energy absorption rate , @xmath36 , which correlated with resonant oscillations in the electron temperature.@xcite although the theory did not explicitly examine the @xmath36 in the limit of a vanishing applied electric field or current , it appears plausible that the energy absorption rate of the 2des might be independent of whether or not an applied electric field or current exists in the specimen . </S>",
    "<S> if the @xmath36 continued to exhibit resonant oscillations even without an applied current or electric field , then it seems plausible that the reflected microwave power would follow the oscillatory @xmath36 and also exhibit oscillations as seen in the experimental data here . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one might tentatively attribute the oscillations in the remotely sensed signal @xmath2 to the oscillatory variation in the energy absorption rate of the microwave photo - excited 2des and the concomitant change in the reflection .    in the radiation driven electron orbit </S>",
    "<S> model,@xcite one expects a periodic back- and forth- radiation driven motion of the electron orbits . </S>",
    "<S> since such oscillatory motion of electron charge is , from the classical perspective , expected to produce radiation , such reflection / emission signal reported by @xmath2 might be expected . </S>",
    "<S> a full theory of this has not yet been published .    in summary , the magnetoresistive response of the microwave photo - excited gaas / algaas 2d electron system has been compared with the concurrent microwave reflection from the 2des . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results indicate a strong correlation between the observed features in the two types of measurements . </S>",
    "<S> curiously , the character of the reflection signal remains unchanged even when the current is switched off in the gaas / algaas hall bar specimen . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest that the 2des is microwave active even in the absence of an applied current .    </S>",
