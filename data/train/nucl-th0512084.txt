    "recently , it has been shown  @xcite that large back - to - back correlations ( bbc ) of particle - antiparticle pairs of bosonic particles might appear in high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions as a consequence of in - medium mass modification of the bosons .",

    "more recently , it was shown  @xcite that bbc of similar strength might appear for fermionic particles as well .",
    "the main physical ingredient used in the evaluation of the effects of in - medium modified masses on two particle correlation functions is a quantum - mechanical correlation induced by a nonzero overlap between in - medium and free states .",
