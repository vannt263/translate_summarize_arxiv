    "there is compelling evidence for believing that a large amount , if not most of baryonic matter in the universe is under the form of dark , unobserved objects . on the other hand , there is also evidence that spiral galaxies are surrounded by a large amount of non - luminous mass which is responsible for their observed small - scale and large - scale kinematic properties ( velocity dispersion and rotation curve ) .",
    "these two facts yield the natural conclusion that baryonic dark matter is a plausible candidate for halo dark matter . a breakthrough in this longstanding",
    ", unsolved problem has been accomplished recently with the developement of microlensing experiments , by inferring the presence of dark objects in the halo through their gravitational effect on luminous matter . a detailed analysis of the first year of the macho ( alcock et al . 1993 ) and eros ( aubourg et al .",
    "1993 ) observations towards the lmc , complemented by the determination of the mass function of low - mass halo stars , yielded an average mass for the dark objects @xmath2 , well within the brown dwarf domain ( mra , chabrier and schaeffer 1996a ) .",
    "the inferred maximum brown dwarf contribution to the halo mass budget was found to be @xmath1 10 to 20% ( alcock et al .",
    "1995 ; gates , gyuk and turner , 1995 ; mra et al .",
    "these results have now to be reconsidered in the light of the most recent analysis of the macho collaboration , which includes one more year lmc data .",
    "this yields now a total of _ seven _ candidates for macho with _ longer _ durations , from 30 to 110 days ( alcock et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in this letter , we re - examine the m - dwarf , brown dwarf and white dwarf contributions to the halo mass budget in light of the most recent observational constraints ( star counts and macho results ) and white dwarf cooling theory",
    "hst star counts at large magnitudes ( bahcall et al .",
    "1994 , hu et al . 1994 ) show that the m - dwarf contribution to the galactic missing mass @xmath3 @xmath4 represents at most a few percents .",
    "a more precise determination can be obtained from the observed luminosity function ( lf ) of high - velocity m - dwarfs in the solar neighborhood ( dahn et al .",
    "a detailed analysis of this lf shows that the mass function ( mf ) of the spheroid ( characterized by a @xmath5 density - profile ) is reasonably well described by a power - law mf @xmath6 with @xmath7 , from 0.6 @xmath8 down to the hydrogen burning limit and a normalization @xmath9pc@xmath10 ( mra et al .",
    "this yields a _",
    "maximum _ local density for the spheroid+halo m - dwarf population @xmath11 pc@xmath10 , and thus an optical depth @xmath12 .",
    "a comparison with the value inferred from the new macho results @xmath13 shows convincingly that m - dwarfs can be responsible for less than @xmath14 of the microlensing events towards the lmc .",
    "on the other hand , reasonnable estimates for the lmc characteristics yield an optical depth @xmath15 , a factor 3 to 4 smaller than the recent macho results ( sahu 1994 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the analysis of the previous macho+eros results showed that the observed events were likely to be due to halo brown dwarfs , with an average mass @xmath2 ( mra et al .",
    "these calculations must be re - examined in the context of the recent macho results .",
    "the new 7 events yield @xmath16 days ( alcock et al . 1996 ) .",
    "since the minimal tangential velocity @xmath17 of the lens is bound by the rotation velocity of the line of sight ( @xmath18 km s@xmath19)(mra et al .",
    "1996b ) , this excludes totally the possibility for these events to be due to brown dwarfs and yields an average mass @xmath20 .",
    "since m - dwarfs are excluded , the inferred optical depth @xmath21 means that about 40% of the hidden mass consists of _ halo white dwarfs_.",
    "the white dwarf contribution to the halo missing mass has been examined over the past by different authors . these studies focussed mainly on the constraint arising from the galaxy chemical evolution ( olive 1986 ; ryu et al .",
    "these authors show that wds are unlikely candidates for providing the _ entire _ halo missing mass .",
    "recent calculation of the expected radiation signature of the progenitors in galactic halos at large redshift ( charlot and silk 1995 ) show that a white dwarf mass fraction larger than @xmath22 of the missing mass would be in conflict with observations .",
    "these results will be commented below .",
    "an independent , more stringent constraint , comes from the observed white dwarf luminosity function ( wdlf ) in the solar neighborhood , as considered by tamanaha , silk , wood and winget ( 1990 ) .",
    "however , although pointing the way , these calculations were based on simplified wd interior and a wd cooling theory aimed at describing the _ disk _ wdlf , thus appropriate for objects younger , and thus warmer , than the expected halo population . in particular",
    "these calculations do not include a _",
    "complete _ treatment of crystallization ( see below ) , which occurs around @xmath23 in wd interiors .",
    "this affects substantially the cooling of halo wds and will modify significantly the expected halo wdlf .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we use the most updated wd cooling theory for carbon / oxygen wds , with the appropriate equation of state both in the classical and in the quantum ( crystal ) regime ( segretain et al .",
    ", 1994 ; chabrier , 1993 ) and a helium - rich atmosphere ( wood 1992 ) , characteristic of most cool ( @xmath24 k ) so - called `` db '' wds .",
    "as first suggested by stevenson ( 1980 ) , the gravitational energy release due to carbon - oxygen _ differentiation _ at crystallization affects drastically the subsequent cooling time of the star , thus changing the luminosity for a given age ( segretain & chabrier 1993 ) .",
    "a consistent treatment of the crystallization phase diagram along wd evolution has been derived recently by segretain et al .",
    "as shown by these authors , the crystallization processes modify appreciably the wd cooling time and then the wdlf for @xmath25 , characteristic of old disk and halo wds .",
    "the lf derived with this theory yields an estimate for the age of the galactic disk @xmath26 gyr , depending on the bolometric correction used for the _ observed _ lf ( hernanz et al .",
    "1994 ) , about 20% larger than estimates based on cooling theories which do not include the _ complete _ crystallization process ( wood 1992 ; see segretain et al . 1994  4.1 for details ) .",
    "the calculations proceed as in hernanz et al .",
    "the wdlf reads :    @xmath27\\times \\phi(m)dm\\eqno(1)\\ ] ]    here @xmath28 is the _ characteristic _ cooling time , where @xmath29 is the wd cooling time .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 denote respectively the age spent on the main sequence for the wd progenitor and the age of the halo .",
    "the function @xmath32 is the initial mass function and @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote respectively the minimum and the maximum mass of the wd progenitors which contribute at luminosity @xmath35 . since the age of the halo is much larger than any time associated with star formation , the initial stellar formation rate @xmath36 is well approximated by a burst at @xmath37 , i.e. a @xmath38 function . in that case eqn(1 ) reduces to :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 represents the number of wds formed at @xmath41 , i.e. the number of stars with a main sequence lifetime @xmath42 .",
    "we verified that finite - time sfr , e.g. a constant sfr along @xmath43 ( a reasonnable representation of a continous series of burst sfrs ) or an exponential sfr yield very similar results .",
    "the progenitor - wd mass relation is @xmath44 ( iben and tutukov 1984 ) .",
    "the wdlf is normalized to :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the ( sought ) mass fraction under the form of wds in the halo of the galaxy .",
    "as shown in eqn(2 ) the most essential parameter in this calculation is the white dwarf cooling time @xmath29 .",
    "we use the afore - mentioned wd cooling sequences calculated in segretain et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and garcia - berro et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "the second important parameter to be determined in eq.(1 ) is the imf @xmath47 .",
    "as mentioned in  2 , a severe constraint arises from the recently determined mass - function ( slope and normalization ) of halo m - dwarfs .",
    "the predicted star counts obtained with this mf for a spheroid(@xmath48)+halo(@xmath49 ) density profile are in perfect agreement with the observations of the hst at large magnitude ( @xmath50 ) ( mra et al . , 1996a ) .",
    "on the other hand , the observed halo metallicity implies that stars above @xmath51 , believed to be type ii supernovae progenitors , represent at most @xmath52 of the halo initial stellar population ( ryu et al .",
    "these observational constraints show that , for wds to contribute significantly to the mass of the halo , the imf must exhibit a strongly _ bimodal _ behaviour and peak around some characteristic mass in the range @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "the minimum mass corresponds to a main - sequence lifetime of the progenitor equal to the age of the halo , i.e. @xmath54 for @xmath55 to 25 gyr .",
    "several functional forms can be advocated for such an ( unknown ) imf .",
    "we elected a simple cut - off power - law function @xmath56 ( see e.g. larson 1986 ) .",
    "this form mimics adequatly a strongly peaked imf and is very similar to functional forms based on stellar formation theory ( adams and laughlin 1996 ) .",
    "the imf is normalized to :    @xmath57    which determines @xmath58 ( for a given @xmath46 and @xmath59 relation ) .",
    "the parameter - space for ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) is constrained by the required negligible number of stars outside the mass - range @xmath62 $ ] but different values yield quantitatively different mass - distributions .",
    "a large number of masses @xmath63 would raise severe problems for the fraction of ejected gas and the subsequent helium and metal galactic enrichment ( hegyi and olive 1986 ; ryu et al .",
    "1990 ) . in order to examine the dependence of the imf on the results , we thus considered two functions , namely ( @xmath64 , @xmath61=5.15 ) , peaked around @xmath65 ( hereafter imf1 ) , and ( @xmath66 , @xmath61=5.75 ) , peaked around @xmath67 ( hereafter imf2 ) .",
    "the complete m - dwarf+wd imf s fulfilling all the afore - mentioned constraints are shown on figure 1 .",
    "* _ observational constraints_*. the lf of field wds has been obtained by liebert et al .",
    "( 1988 ) up to @xmath68 ( i.e. @xmath69 , depending on the bolometric correction @xmath70 ) .",
    "the lf declines abruptdely for @xmath71 , which corresponds to @xmath72 to @xmath73 . as stated by these authors ,",
    "_ no _ wd was found at fainter magnitudes , with this or with other proper - motion samples , whereas stars up to @xmath74 , i.e. three magnitudes fainter , have been observed with similar programs ( liebert et al .",

    "interestingly enough , five wds in the liebert et al .",

    "more recent constraints arise from the hst counts up to @xmath77 ( flynn et al .",
    "1996 ) . for a wd mass fraction @xmath78",
    ", it is easy to show that the observed number of wds in the hst field implies that _ halo _ wds must have @xmath79 .",
    "this is consistent with the observed high - velocity wds .",
    "the colors of the disk and halo wds were taken to be @xmath80 , as suggested by the observations ( liebert et al .",

    "the crosses correspond to a 90% exclusion confidence level in the limit of detection , i.e. the possibility to see at least two wds above this line whereas none has been detected is rejected at the 2-@xmath84 level ( see e.g.  iv of liebert et al .",
    "the solid lines show the _ halo _ wdlfs for halo ages @xmath85 and 20 gyr , normalized to @xmath86 and 8% respectively , for calculations done with imf1",
    ". for the distribution of progenitors corresponding to this imf , differentiation at crystallization in the wd interiors leads to a bump in the halo wdlf in the range @xmath87 , therefore ruling out substantial wd mass fractions .",
    "this shows convincingly the importance of a _ complete _ treatment of crystallization in wd cooling .",
    "calculations with no carbon / oxygen differentiation will underestimate the number of wds by more than a factor @xmath88 , for a given age and luminosity .",
    "conversely they will yield halo ages @xmath89 gyr younger for a given lf . in the same vein ,",
    "an incorrect debye treatment will change significantly the shape of the wdlf .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to the same calculations when using imf2 .",
    "the normalizations correspond now to @xmath90 and 50% , for the same halo ages .",
    "clearly , for the imf2 , a halo wd mass fraction @xmath91 , in agreement with the macho results , can not be excluded , _ provided _ a halo age @xmath92 gyr .",
    "we have compared the star counts predicted by these wdlf s with the recent hst observations at large magnitudes ( flynn et al . 1996 ) , for a @xmath48-spheroid and a @xmath49 halo .",
    "_ all _ wdlfs predict _ at most _ ( depending on @xmath70 ) @xmath93 wd in the hst field at the limit magnitude @xmath94 for a 100% wd halo , and thus are consistent with the hst counts .",
    "this shows that for these scarce and faint objects , large , nearby surveys put more severe constraints than deep pencil searches .",
    "in this letter , we have examined the possibility for the recent macho events ( assuming these events are genuine microlensing events ) to be due either to brown dwarfs or to white dwarfs .",
    "this determines directly the contribution of these objects to the missing mass in the halo of the galaxy .",
    "brown dwarfs are clearly excluded as a significant halo population .",
    "the luminosity function of _ halo _ white dwarfs has been calculated with the most accurate white dwarf cooling theory presently available .",
    "this wdlf is confronted to _ all _ available observational constraints on halo objects .",
    "we show that , under the two _ necessary conditions _ that i ) the imf in the halo differs totally from the one in the disk and exhibits a strongly peaked behaviour around @xmath95 , and ii ) the halo is older than @xmath96 gyr , the white dwarf mass fraction in the halo can represent @xmath97 to 50% of the dark matter density , in agreement with the recent macho results .",
    "this would imply an initial _ stellar _ mass fraction @xmath98 and thus an essentially _ baryonic _ halo .",
    "these results are consistent with the ones obtained from galactic chemical evolution ( ryu et al . 1990 ) , though they are in conflict with the conclusion raised by these authors that the disk must form no later than the halo . however , as stated by these authors , alternative scenarios in the disk formation can be advocated : the left - over gas fraction might have been ejected into the intergalactic medium , as suggested by recent observations of metal - rich hot gas in the local group ( suto et al",
    "the present results are also consistent with the ones obtained by charlot and silk ( 1995 ) , based on the expected radiation signature in high - redshift galactic halos .",
    "these authors considered a hubble time @xmath99 gyr , and solar metallicity ( i.e. slowly evolving ) stars .",
    "the evolution of significantly older , i.e. highly redshifted , low - metallicity stellar populations will certainly be consistent with these observational constraints .    therefore , although providing a plausible explanation for the macho observations and the halo missing mass , the present scenario relies on the necessity to invoke a _ very peculiar _ , fine - tuned imf .",
    "these calculations illustrate the difficulty to reconcile the recent macho results with other observational constraints . a detailed analysis of the ogle , macho and eros results , in the context of a consistent model for the galaxy ,",
