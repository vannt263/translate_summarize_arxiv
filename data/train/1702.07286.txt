    "the uncertainty principle lies at the heart of quantum physics .",
    "it exhibits one of the key divergences between classical and quantum systems .",
    "classically , it is in principle possible to specify the precise value of all measurable quantities simultaneously in a given state of a system . in contrast , whenever two quantum observables do not commute , it is impossible to define a quantum state for which their values are simultaneously specified with infinite precision .",
    "a paradigmatic example is given by heisenberg s original formulation of the uncertainty principle expressed in terms of variances of two canonically - conjugate variables @xcite , such as position @xmath0 and momentum @xmath1 , which was later generalized to a rotation - invariant form by schrdinger @xcite and robertson @xcite .",
    "a different kind of uncertainty relations , originated by bialynicki - birula and mycielski @xcite again for canonically - conjugate variables , relies on shannon entropy instead of variances as a measure of uncertainty ( it was later on developed for discrete observables of finite - dimensional systems @xcite , but here we restrict to continuous - variable observables ) .",
    "this entropic formulation of the uncertainty principle has recently attracted much attention in quantum information sciences because entropies are the natural quantities of interest in this area ( see @xcite for a survey ) . in particular , an extended version of the entropic uncertainty relation was derived , where some available quantum side - information ( e.g. , a quantum memory ) is taken into account @xcite .",
    "it expresses the tradeoff between the information that two parties may have on non - commuting observables , which is of particular relevance to quantum key distribution . a variant version of this uncertainty relation formulated in terms of smooth entropies @xcite indeed provides a very useful tool for finite - key security analysis @xcite , going beyond asymptotic proofs . in the special case of continuous - variable quantum key distribution , the original entropic uncertainty relation @xcite was first applied to proving the optimality of gaussian individual attacks at the asymptotic key limit @xcite .",
    "more recently , a precise finite - key analysis for certain continuous - variable protocols was performed based on the smooth - entropy formalism extended to infinite dimensions @xcite .",
    "entropic uncertainty relations find other applications , for example , in the context of separability criteria .",
    "the duan - simon separability criteria @xcite based on variances for continuous - variables systems can be reformulated with entropies @xcite , yielding a more sensitive detection of entanglement in some cases .",
    "even more generally , a deep conceptual link between the entropic uncertainty relation and the wave - particle duality has been pointed out @xcite , which emphasizes the pivotal role of entropies in the uncertainty principle .    in this article",
    ", we investigate whether tighter entropic uncertainty relations can be derived , which , by taking correlations into account , are saturated for _ all _ gaussian pure states ( in analogy with the schrdinger - robertson uncertainty relations ) . to reach this goal",
    ", we make use of the entropy power , which is a standard notion in shannon information theory for real - valued signals . in section  ii",
    ", we first review variance- and entropy - based uncertainty relations , and then define what we coin the _ entropy - power uncertainty relation _ for a pair of canonically - conjugate variables .",
    "it trivially implies the heisenberg relation as a simple consequence of the definition of entropy power ( actually , they coincide for gaussian states ) .",
    "then , in section  iii , we find an extended form of the entropy - power uncertainty relation , which is stronger than the regular form for rotated variables as it involves the covariance matrix .",
    "it is proven by variational calculus , based on some natural assumption on the concavity of the uncertainty functional .",
    "its expression is justified from another conjectured uncertainty relation involving the joint entropy , which is more elegant ( it is explicitly rotation invariant ) but is only defined for states with a positive wigner function . in section",
    "iv , we conduct extensive numerical tests in order to illustrate the validity of our extended uncertainty relations and the conjectured concavity , while we conclude in section  v.",
    "in this paper , we will use quantum optics notations , so variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 stand for the quadrature components of a bosonic field ( but they can , of course , also be viewed as the position and momentum variables of a mechanical degree of freedom ) .",

    "more precisely , if we define the covariance matrix @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the symmetrized form of the central second - order cross moment , we note that the heisenberg relation is saturated for pure gaussian states provided the principal axes of the @xmath17 are aligned with the @xmath13- and @xmath14-axes , namely @xmath18 .",

    "importantly , relation ( [ schrod - robert ] ) is saturated by all pure gaussian states , regardless of the orientation of the principal axes of the covariance matrix .",

    "this can also be connected to relative entropies as a measure of non - gaussianity . from the definition of @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    ", we get @xmath69 which implies that @xmath70 or equivalently @xmath71 it is clear that eq .",
    "( [ epur ] ) becomes more stringent than eq .",
    "( [ heisenberg ] ) as soon as we deviate from a gaussian state .",
    "our goal is to address the problem that , unlike the schrdinger - robertson uncertainty relation , the entropic uncertainty relation ( [ birula ] )  or equivalently the entropy - power uncertainty relation ( [ epur ] )  is not saturated by all pure gaussian states but only by those whose principal axes are aligned with the @xmath13- and @xmath14-axes . in other words",
    ", we would like to make eq .",
    "( [ birula ] ) or ( [ epur ] ) depend on the possible correlations between @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( as witnessed , for instance , by @xmath72 ) .",
    "ideally , the new inequality should have the property of being invariant under all gaussian unitary transformations ( displacements and symplectic transformations ) and being saturated by any pure gaussian state , regardless of the orientation of the principal axes .",
    "a first natural idea is to make use of the joint differential entropy , which is defined as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the joint probability density of the random variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the joint entropy can also be expressed as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the mutual information .",
    "thus , one can think of improving the entropic uncertainty relation ( [ birula ] ) by replacing @xmath77 with @xmath78 . moving the mutual information @xmath79 on the right - hand side of the inequality",
    ", it thus corresponds to an improvement of the lower bound .",
    "moreover , @xmath78 has the invariance property that we seek for .",
    "indeed , if we transform the coordinates according to @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the transformation matrix , the joint differential entropy transforms as @xcite @xmath82 thus , if @xmath81 corresponds to a symplectic transformation , @xmath83 , so the joint differential entropy remains invariant .",
    "of course , @xmath78 is also invariant under ( @xmath13,@xmath14)-displacement , so it looks like the right entropy functional .",
    "however , we deal with quantum states , so the wigner function @xmath84 is not a genuine probability density and may admit negative values .",
    "hence , the joint differential entropy of @xmath84 is not always defined ( one would need to compute the logarithm of negative values ) , as well as the mutual information @xmath79 .",
    "nevertheless , we conjecture that the use of the joint differential entropy remains valid if we restrict to states admitting a non - negative wigner function , namely @xmath85 this conjecture can equivalently be written as @xmath86 for all states with a wigner function that is everywhere non - negative , so that it can only do better than eq .",
    "( [ birula ] ) since @xmath76 .",
    "a difficulty , however , is related to the fact that characterizing the set of states with positive wigner functions is not an easy task @xcite .",
    "in addition , for states admitting negative wigner functions , eq .",
    "( [ conj1form1 ] ) or ( [ conj1form2 ] ) is useless . in sect",
    "iv , we run some numerics to check the validity of the conjecture , and provide examples of states where eq .",
    "( [ conj1form2 ] ) gives a slightly better bound than eq .",
    "( [ birula ] ) although the correlation between @xmath13 and @xmath14 is not accessible via the second - order moments ( @xmath18 ) but via the mutual information @xmath79 only .",
    "equations ( [ conj1form1 ] ) or ( [ conj1form2 ] ) are not valid for states with negative wigner functions , but they give us a hint on how to proceed in order to derive an entropic uncertainty relation that is valid for all states and takes correlations into account . while the joint entropy and mutual information are not defined for all states , they are well defined for gaussian states ( since their wigner function is always positive ) . in particular , the gaussian mutual information is expressed as a function of the covariance matrix , @xmath87 we obtain our tight entropic uncertainty relation simply by substituting @xmath79 with @xmath88 in eq .",
    "( [ conj1form1 ] ) , namely @xmath89 we will show below ( under some assumption ) that this inequality holds for all states , regardless of whether the wigner function is positive everywhere or not . unlike eq .",
    "( [ conj1form1 ] ) , however , it is not invariant under rotations .",
    "note that @xmath88 vanishes if the principal axes of the covariance matrix are the @xmath13- and @xmath14-axes , i.e. @xmath18 , so that we fall back on the regular entropic uncertainty relation ( [ birula ] ) in this case .    as before ,",
    "it is useful to rewrite our new relation in terms of entropy powers , resulting in @xmath90 which can be viewed as an improved version of the entropy - power uncertainty relation ( [ epur ] ) , where the lower bound @xmath91 is lifted up when the principal axes differ from the @xmath13- and @xmath14-axes ( @xmath72 ) .",

    ".    finally , note that our conjectured rotation - invariant uncertainty relation ( [ conj1form1 ] ) based on the joint entropy is obviously equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ conjecture ] ) for gaussian states , so in both cases the bound is reached by any pure gaussian state , regardless of the orientation of the principal axes .",
    "thus , by taking the exponential of the joint entropy @xmath78 and using the fact that the maximum entropy is reached for a gaussian distribution , a similar derivation shows that relation ( [ conj1form1 ] ) also implies the schrdinger - robertson uncertainty relation .",
    "we now prove our tight entropic uncertainty relation ( [ conjecture ] ) by use of a variational method , in analogy to the procedure used in ref .",
    "@xcite to prove a noise - dependent entropic uncertainty relation .",
    "more precisely , we will prove that any squeezed vacuum state rotated by an arbitrary angle is a local minimum of the uncertainty functional @xmath103 since @xmath104 is invariant under @xmath12-displacements , it will imply that all gaussian pure states are similarly local minima .",
    "we assume that these are the unique solutions of our minimization problem . by assuming that the uncertainty functional @xmath104 is concave in @xmath105 , which we have verified numerically in section iv",

    "we have not been able to find an analytical proof of our conjectured rotation - invariant uncertainty relation ( [ conj1form1 ] ) based on the joint entropy , so we have turned to numerical tests . since relation ( [ conj1form1 ] ) is restricted to states with positive wigner functions , we have tested , in particular , passive states of the harmonic oscillator , i.e. , mixtures of fock states with decreasing weight for increasing photon number @xcite .    in figure",

    "thus , we have proven the concavity of @xmath168 when two states with the same covariance matrix are mixed . yet , in the general case , we have not been able to prove the concavity .",
    "we have shown that the entropic uncertainty relation derived by bialynicki - birula and mycielskican can be expressed as an entropy - power uncertainty relation , eq .",

    "possible applications of these new entropic uncertainty relations include the elaboration of stronger separability criteria for continuous - variable systems .",
    "both variance- and entropy - based uncertainty relations can be translated into a sufficient entanglement condition ( a necessary and sufficient condition for gaussian states ) as they can be used to express a condition on the physicality of the partially - transposed state @xcite .",

    "@xcite it was shown that an uncertainty relation that is tight for all fock states @xcite yields an entanglement criterion that enables the detection of certain non - gaussian entangled states whose entanglement remains undetected by the duan - simon criterion .",
