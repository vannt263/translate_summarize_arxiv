    "the two - dimensional model with @xmath0-vector order parameter and cubic anisotropy is known to have a rich phase diagram ; it contains , under different values of @xmath0 and of the anisotropy parameter , the ising - like and kosterlitz - thouless critical points , lines of the first - order phase transitions , and the line of the second - order transitions with continuously varying critical exponents ( see , e. g. @xcite for review ) .",
    "this model is related to many other familiar models in various particular cases , while for @xmath12 it describes the critical behavior of two - dimensional weakly disordered ising systems . moreover ,",
    "exact solutions are known for the two - dimensional cubic model in the several limits such as an ising decoupled limit , the limit of extremely strong anisotropy for @xmath6 @xcite and the replica limit @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the correspondence , in particular regions of the phase diagram , with the @xmath0-color ashkin - teller models , discrete cubic models , and planar model with fourth order anisotropy give further informations about the critical behavior .",
    "all these issues are reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite and we will not repeat them here .",
    "these features make the two - dimensional @xmath0-vector cubic model a convenient and , perhaps , unique testbed for evaluation of the analytical and numerical power of perturbative methods widely used nowadays in the theory of critical phenomena .",
    "the field - theoretical renormalization - group ( rg ) approach in physical dimensions is among of them .",
    "recently , the critical behavior of the two - dimensional @xmath0-vector cubic model was explored using the renormalization - group technique in the space of fixed dimensionality @xcite .",
    "the four - loop expansions for the @xmath2-functions and critical exponents were calculated and analyzed using the borel transformation combined with the conformal mapping and pad - approximant techniques as a tool for resummation of the divergent rg series .",
    "the most part of predictions obtained within the renormalization group approach turned out to be in accord with known exact results . at the same time , some findings were quite new .",
    "in particular , for @xmath6 the resummed four - loop rg expansions for @xmath2-functions were found to yield a cubic fixed point with ( almost ) marginal stability ; this point does not correspond to any of the critical asymptotics revealed by exact methods ever applied .",
    "although the stability properties of the cubic fixed point look very similar to those of its ising counterpart , these points were found to lie too far from each other ( for moderate @xmath0 ) to consider the distance between them as a splitting caused by the limited accuracy of the rg approximation employed .",
    "it is worthy to note that this situation is quite different from what we have in three dimensions .",
    "indeed , for the three - dimensional cubic model the structure of the rg flow diagram is known today with a rather high accuracy .",
    "recent five - loop @xcite and six - loop @xcite rg calculations certainly confirmed that for @xmath6 the cubic fixed point does not merge with any other fixed point and governs the specific anisotropic mode of critical behavior , distinguishable from the ising and heisenberg modes ( see , e. g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is very desirable , therefore , to clear up to what extent the location of the cubic fixed point in two dimensions is sensitive to the order of the rg calculations and , more generally , whether this point really exists at the flow diagram or its appearance is the approximation artifact caused by the finiteness of the perturbative series and by an ignorance of the confluent singularities significant in two dimensions @xcite",
    ".    of prime interest is also the situation with the line of fixed points that should run , under @xmath3 , from the ising fixed point to the @xmath4 one . within the four - loop approximation ,",
    "the zeros of @xmath2-functions for the @xmath13-symmetric and anisotropic coupling constants form two lines that for @xmath3 are practically parallel to each other and separated by the distance that is smaller than the error bar appropriate to the working approximation @xcite .",
    "will the higher - order contributions keep these two lines parallel ?",
    "will an account for the higher - order terms further diminish the distance between these lines or their splitting should be attributed , at least partially , to the influence of the singular terms just mentioned ?    to answer the above questions , it is necessary to analyze the critical behavior of the two - dimensional cubic model in the higher perturbative orders . recently",
    ", the renormalization - group expansions for the two - dimensional @xmath13-symmetric model were obtained within the five - loop approximation @xcite .",
    "in the course of this study , all the integrals corresponding to the five - loop four - leg and two - leg feynman graphs have been evaluated .",
    "this makes it possible to investigate the critical thermodynamics of anisotropic two - dimensional models with several couplings in the five - loop approximation . in this paper ,",
    "such an investigation will be carried out for the two - dimensional @xmath0-vector model with cubic anisotropy .    for studying the effect of cubic anisotropies one usually considers the @xmath14 theory @xcite : @xmath15   +   { 1\\over 4 ! } \\sum_{i , j=1}^n \\left ( u_0 + v_0 \\delta_{ij } \\right )",
    "\\phi^2_i \\phi^2_j \\right\\ } ,   \\label{hphi4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which the added cubic term breaks explicitly the @xmath16 ) invariance leaving a residual discrete cubic symmetry given by the reflections and permutations of the field components .",
    "this term favors the spin orientations towards the faces or the corners of an @xmath0-dimensional hypercube for @xmath17 or @xmath18 respectively . in two dimensions",
    "the effect of anisotropy is particularly important : systems possessing continuous symmetry do not exhibit conventional long - range order at finite temperature , while models with discrete symmetry do undergo phase transitions into conventionally ordered phase .",
    "in general , the model ( [ hphi4 ] ) has four fixed points : the trivial gaussian one , the ising one in which the @xmath0 components of the field decouple , the o(@xmath0)-symmetric and the cubic fixed points . the gaussian fixed point is always unstable , and so is the ising fixed point for @xmath19  @xcite . indeed , in the latter case , it is natural to interpret eq .",
    "( [ hphi4 ] ) as the hamiltonian of @xmath0 ising - like systems coupled by the @xmath13-symmetric term .",
    "but this interaction is the sum of the products of the energy operators of the different ising systems .",
    "therefore , at the ising fixed point , the crossover exponent associated with the o(@xmath0)-symmetric quartic term is given by the specific - heat critical exponent @xmath20 of the ising model , independently of @xmath0 ( for @xmath8 this argument is equivalent to the harris criterion @xcite ) .",
    "since @xmath20 is positive for all @xmath19 the ising fixed point is unstable .",
    "obviously , in two dimensions this argument only tells us that the crossover exponent at this fixed point vanishes .",
    "higher order corrections to rg equations may lead either to a marginally stable fixed point @xcite or to a line of fixed points .",
    "it was argued that for @xmath5 the former possibility is realized , while for @xmath21 the latter one holds ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the stability properties of the fixed points depend on @xmath0 . for sufficiently small values of @xmath0 , @xmath22 , the o(@xmath0)-symmetric fixed point is stable and the cubic one is unstable . for @xmath23 and @xmath19 ,",
    "the opposite is true : the renormalization - group flow is driven towards the cubic fixed point , which now describes the generic critical behavior of the system . at @xmath24 , the two fixed points should coincide for @xmath19 . at @xmath25 , it is expected that @xmath26 @xcite and a line of fixed points connecting the ising and the @xmath27-symmetric fixed points exists @xcite .    a generalization of the hamiltonian eq . ( [ hphi4 ] ) is obtained by considering @xmath0 coupled @xmath7 vector models , instead of @xmath0 ising models .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian ( defining the so called @xmath1 model ) is @xcite @xmath28    +   \\sum_{ij , ab } { 1\\over 4!}\\left ( u_0 + v_0 \\delta_{ij } \\right ) \\phi^2_{a , i } \\phi^2_{b , j } \\bigr\\ } , \\label{hphi4mn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the continuous @xmath31 symmetry is explicitly broken by the @xmath32 term to @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the discrete group of permutations of @xmath0 elements .",
    "the presence of such discrete symmetry allows for a finite temperature phase transition under general values of @xmath0 and @xmath11 ( differently from models with @xmath35 ) . for @xmath36",
    "it reduces to the hamiltonian of the cubic model , but it has physical applications for @xmath37 too . for @xmath38 and generic @xmath11 , under the condition @xmath39 and @xmath18 , it describes the critical behavior of quenched dilute @xmath7 models @xcite . for @xmath40 and @xmath21 ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath18 ,",
    "it is relevant for the second - order phase transition in planar ( isotropic ) antiferromagnets with complicated ordering as the three dimensional sinusoidal magnets tbau@xmath42 , dyc@xmath42 , type - ii antiferromagnets tbas , tbp ( type - iii antiferromagnets k@xmath42ircl@xmath43 , sinusoidal tbd@xmath42 ) and many others @xcite . for @xmath44 and @xmath17",
    "an exact mapping @xcite relates the hamiltonian ( [ hphi4mn ] ) with the @xmath45 symmetric one , describing the critical behavior of frustrated antiferromagnets with non - collinear order @xcite .",
    "for @xmath46 it describes @xmath7 models with constrains @xcite ( as @xmath7 models with annealed disorder ) .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hphi4mn ] ) has been largely studied in the framework of @xmath47 expansion ( @xmath48 ) @xcite and directly in three dimensions @xcite , mainly to understand the critical behavior of the antiferromagnets quoted above .",
    "much less studies were devoted to the two dimensional case for @xmath37 , since its main features can be understood by non - perturbative arguments .",
    "in fact , three fixed points always exist in the rg flow for any @xmath0 and @xmath11 : the always unstable gaussian ( @xmath49 ) , the @xmath7 ( with @xmath50 ) and the @xmath51 ( with @xmath35 ) .",
    "their stability properties are known from exact arguments . as for the ising fixed point in the cubic model , the stability of the @xmath7 fixed point",
    "is governed by the specific - heat critical exponent @xmath52 of the @xmath7 model .",
    "being ( in two dimensions ) @xmath52 negative for all @xmath53 , the @xmath7 fixed point is stable for physical values of @xmath11 .",
    "an exact argument ensures that the @xmath51 fixed point is unstable when @xmath54 @xcite , thus it is always unstable for physical values ( apart from the replica limit @xmath55 , but in this case it is not reachable from the physical initial condition with @xmath56 ) . in the framework of @xmath47 expansion another fixed point ( called mixed )",
    "exists @xcite .",
    "it is the generalization to @xmath37 of the cubic one .",
    "its analytic continuation to @xmath25 is expected to be in the region @xmath39 and @xmath18 for @xmath57 and in the @xmath58 region ( unphysical ) in the replica limit .",
    "it is expected to be unstable in both the cases .",
    "anyway , these arguments still do not completely characterize the rg flow of the @xmath1-model .",
    "indeed for @xmath57 and @xmath17 the situation is more controversial .",
    "the @xmath47 expansion indicates that no fixed point exists and consequently it was longly believed that no continuous transition can take place in these systems .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath59 the quoted mapping between the @xmath1 and the @xmath45 models shows the presence of a fixed point ( found in the @xmath45 model at four @xcite and five loops @xcite ) in the region @xmath17 .",
    "consequently the transition should be second order in the chiral universality class .",
    "the natural question arising is whether the fixed point found at @xmath59 is a peculiar feature or it persists to some larger values of @xmath0 and @xmath11  ( not too large , since for @xmath60 , at fixed @xmath11 , we expect that the @xmath47 expansion can be smoothly continued up to @xmath25 ) .",
    "an answer to this question can be found within higher order perturbative expansion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] the five - loop contributions to the renormalization - group functions",
    "are calculated and the singularities of borel transforms of the renormalization - group series are discussed for the general @xmath1 model .",
