    "bipartite and multipartite entanglement is the main resource that gives rise to many of the applications of quantum information and computation , like for example quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum cryptography @xcite , among others ( see for instance refs .",
    "a compound system is entangled when it is impossible to attribute a complete set of properties to any of its parts . in this case , and for pure states , it is impossible to factor the state in a product of independent factors belonging to its parts . in this paper",
    "we will consider bipartite systems composed of two @xmath3 fermions .",
    "our aim is to uncover some specific features that apply when both particles are identical .",
    "they appear itemized in the next page .",
    "states of two identical fermions have to obey the symmetrization postulate .",
    "this implies that they decompose into linear combinations of slater determinants ( sls ) of individual states . naively , as these sls",
    "can not be factorized further , indistinguishability seems to imply entanglement .",
    "this is reinforced by the observation that the entropy of entanglement ( eoe ) is bounded from below by @xmath4 , well above the lower limit @xmath5 for a pair of non - entangled distinguishable particles .",
    "so , it looks like there is an inescapable amount of uncertainty , and hence of entanglement , in any state of two identical fermions .",
    "the above issue has been extensively examined in the literature @xcite with the following result : part of the uncertainty ( giving @xmath6 ) corresponds to the impossibility to individuate which one is the first or the second particle of the system .",
    "this explains why the lower limit for the eoe is 1 .",
    "consider for instance two identical @xmath3 fermions in a singlet state @xmath7.\\ ] ] the antisymmetrization does not preclude the assignment of properties to the particles , but only assigning them precisely to particle 1 or particle 2 .",
    "the reduced density matrix of any of the particles is @xmath8 with an eoe @xmath9 . the portion of @xmath10 above 1 ( if any ) is genuine entanglement as it corresponds to the impossibility of attributing precise properties to the particles of the system @xcite .",
    "assume for instance that we endow the previous fermions with the capability of being outside ( @xmath11 ) or inside ( @xmath12 ) the laboratory ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) .",
    "we now have two different possibilities : either the fermion outside has spin up ( @xmath17 ) or spin down ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "hence , there are two different sls for a system built by a pair of particles with opposite spins , one outside , the other inside the laboratory @xmath19 , \\nonumber \\\\ { \\rm sl}(1,2)_2 & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\psi(1)^{\\downarrow}\\,\\varphi(2)^{\\uparrow}- \\varphi(1)^{\\uparrow}\\ , \\psi(2)^{\\downarrow } ] .",
    "\\label{j1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] they form two different biorthogonal states , the combination @xmath20/\\sqrt{2}$ ] corresponding to the singlet and @xmath21/\\sqrt{2}$ ] to the triplet state ( with respect to the total spin @xmath22 ) .",
    "an arbitrary state @xmath23 would then be a linear combination of these two sls : @xmath24 giving an eoe @xmath25 clearly , when @xmath26 or @xmath27 vanish , we come back to @xmath6 , as the only uncertainty left is the very identity of the particles . summarizing ,",
    "while indistinguishability is an issue to be solved by antisymmetrization within each sl , entanglement is an issue pertaining to the superposition of different sls @xcite . at the end",
    ", we could even decide to call 1 to the variables of the outside particle , and forget about symmetrization @xmath28 as both particles are far away from each other . in this case , the eoe @xmath29 is lesser than the one corresponding to antisymmetrized states by a quantity of 1 , which is just the uncertainty associated to antisymmetrization . from now on we will consider the latter definition of @xmath10 , which gives the genuine amount of entanglement between the two particles .",
    "notice that for half - odd @xmath30 , the number @xmath31 of slater determinants is bounded by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the dimension of each hilbert space of the configuration or momentum degrees of freedom for each of the two fermions .",
    "much in the same way as above , we could consider one of the particles as right moving ( @xmath34 ) the other as left moving ( @xmath35 ) , giving rise to two sls in parallel with the above discussion .",
    "this is the first step towards the inclusion of the full set of commuting operators for the system .",
    "in addition to the spin components ( @xmath36 ) or helicities , there are the total @xmath37 and relative @xmath38 momenta . in the center of mass ( com )",
    "frame we could consider the system described by the continuum of sls @xmath39 , \\nonumber\\\\ { \\rm sl}(1,2;\\mathbf{p})_{-s } & = & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\psi(1)_0^{-s}\\,\\psi(2)_\\pi^{s}- \\psi(1)_\\pi^{s}\\ , \\psi(2)_0^{-s } ] , \\label{j5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the labels 0 and @xmath42 are the azimuthal angles when we laid the axes along @xmath38 .",
    "finally , there is a pair of sls for each @xmath38 , so that a general state made with two opposite spin particles with relative momentum @xmath38 could be written in the form : @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "again , we run into the impossibility to tell which is 1 and which is 2 .",
    "in addition there may be some uncertainty about the total spin state , whether a singlet or a triplet , or conversely , about the spin component of any of the particles , @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "after this discussion it should be clear to what extent entanglement and distinguishability belong to different realms @xcite .",
    "the only requirement to include identical particles is to symmetrize the expressions used for unlike particles . until now",
    ", we have only considered the free case .",
    "we have to examine the case of two interacting particles , as interaction is expected to be the source of subsequent entanglement @xcite .",
    "obviously , the answer may depend on a tricky way on the detailed form of the interaction , of its spin dependence in particular .",
    "it also seems that the role of particles identity , if any , will be played through symmetrization .    in the following",
    "we will show that spin entanglement is generated for the case of two interacting spin-@xmath47 identical particles , with the following features :    * spin - spin entanglement is generated even by spin independent interactions . * in this case , it is independent of any symmetrization procedure .",
    "* this phenomenon does not appear for unlike particles .",
    "we first tackle the scattering of two unequal @xmath3 particles @xmath48 and @xmath49 which run into each other with relative com momentum @xmath38 .",
    "we set the frame axes by the initial momentum @xmath38 of particle @xmath48 , and let the spin components be @xmath50 and @xmath51 along an arbitrary but fixed axis .",
    "we will consider a spin independent hamiltonian @xmath52 , so the evolution conserves @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we denote by @xmath55 @xmath56 the state of particle @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) that propagates along direction @xmath0 with spin @xmath30 . in these conditions the scattering proceeds as : @xmath57 where @xmath0 is the scattering angle and @xmath58 the scattering amplitude",
    ". we will consider @xmath0 different from 0 or @xmath42 to avoid forward and backward directions .",
    "while the increase of uncertainty due to the interaction is clear , because a continuous manifold of final directions with probabilities @xmath59 opened up from just one initial direction , spin remains untouched .",
    "the information about @xmath60 is the same before and after the scattering ; as much as we knew the initial spin of @xmath48 , we know its final spin whatever the final direction is . in other words , spin was not entangled by the interaction .",
    "we will now translate these well known facts to the case of identical particles , where they do not hold true .",
    "let particle @xmath49 be identical to @xmath48 .",
    "consider the same initial state as before : a particle @xmath48 with momentum @xmath38 and spin @xmath30 runs into another @xmath48 with momentum @xmath61 and spin @xmath62 .",
    "notice there is maximal information on the state .",
    "we could write @xmath63 , and eventually symmetrize .",
    "we now focus on the final state .",
    "it is no longer true that particle @xmath48 will come out with momentum @xmath64 and spin @xmath30 with amplitude @xmath58 while the amplitude for coming out with momentum @xmath64 and spin @xmath62 vanishes .",
    "recalling that @xmath49 above did become @xmath48 , the two cases @xmath65 and @xmath66 fuse into a unique state @xmath67 as shown in figure [ figsse1bis ] .    , @xmath68 indicate the corresponding third component of spin.,width=302 ]    notice the uncertainty acquired by the spin : now particle @xmath48 comes out from the interaction along @xmath0 either with spin @xmath30 or with spin @xmath62 , with relative amplitudes @xmath58 and @xmath69 respectively .",
    "in other words , spin was entangled during the spin independent evolution . here , it is not the spin dependence of the interaction , but the existence of additional degrees of freedom which generate spin - spin entanglement .",
    "these , act as ancillas creating an effective spin - spin interaction that entangles the two fermions .",
    "the ancilla and the degree of entanglement depend on the scattering angle @xmath0 .",
    "notice that for @xmath1 both amplitudes @xmath58 and @xmath69 become equal , so that the degree of generated entanglement is maximal , 1 e - bit . on the other hand , for @xmath70 , it generally holds @xmath71 , so that in the forward and backward scattering almost no entanglement would be generated .",
    "however , this depends on the specific interaction . in sec .",
    "[ asecslo ] we will clarify this point with coulomb interaction .",
    "symmetrization does not change this , it only expresses that we can not tell which one is 1 and which one is 2 .",
    "the properly symmetrized initial state is @xmath72 . \\label{j9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the scattering process could be written in terms of sls as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the final momentum and the slater determinants are given in ( [ j5 ] ) .",
    "both , this expression and eq.([j8 ] ) , describe the same physical situation and lead to the same entanglement generation .",
    "the bosonic case may be analyzed in an analogous way .",
    "the modification for two - dimensional spin hilbert spaces ( i.e. photons ) would be a sign change in eqs .",
    "( [ j5 ] ) , ( [ j9 ] ) and ( [ j10 ] ) , as bosonic statistics has associated symmetric states . the equivalent of eq .",
    "( [ j10 ] ) for bosons is a genuine entangled state for @xmath75 , much as in the fermionic case .",
    "we now consider coulomb interaction at lowest order to illustrate the reasonings presented above . in this case @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a numerical factor depending on the charge @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath79 and @xmath80 are two of the mandelstam variables , associated to @xmath81 and @xmath82 channels respectively , and depending on the scattering angle @xmath0 . for initial @xmath83 and final @xmath84 relative 4-momenta of the scattering fermions ,",
    "they are given by @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "in the com frame , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the mass of each fermion and @xmath89 is the available energy .    according to this , the spin part of the state ( [ j8 ] ) for this case ,",
    "properly normalized , is @xmath90 being @xmath91 the two amplitudes @xmath92 and @xmath93 vary monotonously as @xmath0 grows , becoming equal for @xmath1 . the physical meaning for this",
    "is that for @xmath94 , the knowledge about the system is maximal and the entanglement minimal ( zero ) , and for increasing @xmath0 the knowledge of the system decreases continuously until reaching its minimum value at @xmath1 .",
    "accordingly , the entanglement grows with @xmath0 until reaching its maximum value for @xmath1 .",
    "we plot in figure [ figsse2 ] the eoe @xcite @xmath95 of state ( [ eqsse13 ] ) as a function of @xmath0 , for @xmath96 .",
    "the entanglement grows monotonically until @xmath1 , where it becomes maximal ( 1 e - bit ) .     as a function of @xmath0 . ]",
    "in order to analyze the role the @xmath0 scattering angle plays in the generation of these genuine quantum correlations , we consider now the degree of violation of bell s inequality as a function of @xmath0 . to this purpose",
    ", we define @xcite the observable @xmath97,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 is the ( normalized ) state ( [ j8 ] ) and @xmath99 , @xmath100 are arbitrary unit vectors . in eq .",
    "( [ eqsse15 ] ) we consider the amplitudes @xmath58 and @xmath69 normalized for each @xmath0 , in the form @xmath101 .",
    "we consider three coplanar unit vectors , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath102 .",
    "@xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "we have @xmath106 the bell s inequality , given by @xcite @xmath107 will then be @xmath108    for the particular case of coulomb interaction at lowest order here considered , @xmath109 and thus the critical angle for which the inequality becomes violated is @xmath110 for @xmath111 . for @xmath112 the bell s inequality does not hold .",
    "we show in figure [ figsse3 ] the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath113 together with the classical - quantum border , @xmath114 , at @xmath110 .",
    "thus , for experiments with @xmath115 one could be able in principle to discriminate between local realism and quantum mechanics .     as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the classical - quantum border corresponds to @xmath111 , with @xmath110 . ]",
    "this is in contrast with recent analysis of bell s inequalities violation in elementary particle systems @xcite , where the emphasis was placed on flavor entanglement , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and the like .",
    "these analysis presented @xcite two kinds of drawbacks coming from the lack of experimenter s free will and from the unitary evolution with decaying states .",
    "these issues reduce the significance of the experiments up to the point of preventing their use as tests of quantum mechanics versus local realistic theories .",
    "the spin - spin entanglement analyzed in this paper does not have this kind of problems and could be used in principle for that purpose .",
    "in summary , we analyzed the relation between entanglement and antisymmetrization for identical particles , in the context of spin - independent particle scattering .",
    "we showed that , in order to create genuine spin - spin quantum correlations between two @xmath3 fermions , spin - dependent interactions are not compulsory .",
    "the identity of the particles along with an interaction between degrees of freedom different from the spin , suffice for this purpose .",
    "the entanglement generated this way is not a fictitious one due to antisymmetrization , but a real one , and violates a certain bell s inequality for @xmath118 .",
