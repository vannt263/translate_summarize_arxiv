    "decays of @xmath0  states contribute to measurements of other baryons , such as their inclusion in @xmath1  yields and spectra via @xmath5 ( with a branching ratio close to 100% ) . because the decay is electromagnetic ,",
    "short decay lengths make this measurement possible only by identification of the partner @xmath6  or its missing energy .",
    "accurate particle production model comparisons would benefit from understanding such contributions .",
    "a notable instance involves one of the more prominent expectations of quark gluon plasma : strangeness enhancement in the antihyperon channel measured via @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "measurements often entangle weak decay feeddown in both the numerator and denominator , like @xmath8 .",
    "interpretation of @xmath1  spectra ( such as @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11 versus mass systematics ) may also suffer from not knowing @xmath2  contributions .",
    "whether final state interactions of @xmath0  baryons in heavy ion collisions differ from @xmath1  is unknown as their cross sections have been measured with very little overlap ( at @xmath12 gev , where they appear to agree with a value of approximately 33 mb  @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , there exist data from only one experiment on how the production of @xmath2  and @xmath1  differ over phase space in nuclear collisions ( @xmath13+@xmath14 at @xmath15 gev/@xmath16 ) , where it appears the ratio @xmath17 is constant at @xmath18@xmath19 .",
    "different feeddown from resonances into these states in larger nuclear collisions may alter this .",
    "any system size dependence would impact observed trends like the linearity between @xmath1  and @xmath20 yields seen in 130 gev @xmath21+@xmath21 data at rhic  @xcite .",
    "a better understanding of the physics of rhic collisions will come from measuring relative yields of the @xmath2  and @xmath1  .",
    "it has been stated that isospin dictates that the ratio of the production cross sections @xmath23 should be 1/3  @xcite .",
    "reasons for this are not obvious , so we will examine other production arguments here . to be clear , we will consider _ final _ yields to be after strong ( resonance ) decays , but before electroweak decays .",
    "using thermal model parameters fit from central 200 gev @xmath21+@xmath21 star data  @xcite , the thermus thermal model gives a primordial ratio of 0.67 , and a final ratio of 0.36  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of either of these values on the parameters of the thermal model is very weak , but it is clear that the resonances play a strong role .",
    "this is noteworthy because there are indications that resonances are thermally under - populated ( at least in the final state ) in the @xmath21+@xmath21 data , but reasonable in @xmath13+@xmath13  @xcite .",
    "simple counting rules in quark coalescence models , expected to be relevant only under conditions of very dense matter with sub - hadronic degrees of freedom  @xcite , lead to yield ratios of 1/1 for primordial production , but feeddown from resonances into both species reduces this ratio to 1/5 if the resonances are fully - populated  @xcite . here",
    ", the window is larger than for the thermal model .",
    "if central @xmath21+@xmath21 collisions produce a @xmath22  value near 0.2 or 1.0 , this may serve as an indicator for quark coalescence .",
    "event generators also have predictive power .",
    "hijing/@xmath24 has no final state rescattering to alter yields of resonances  @xcite , giving a value of 0.37 for the ratio in 200 gev @xmath25+@xmath21 collisions , which agrees with the thermal model prediction for a fully equilibrated system at rhic including resonances .",
    "the low energy behavior of the @xmath22  ratio shows a rise from threshold for associated production of a @xmath2  ( @xmath13+@xmath26 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fi : pastres ] .",
    "measurements at intermediate energies show some spread , but generally cluster near the isospin ratio of 1/3 .",
    "only one data point exists from a colliding system larger than @xmath13+@xmath14 , from @xmath13+@xmath27 at @xmath28 gev  @xcite , which has a rather high value of @xmath29 , but is consistent with 1/3 within errors .",
    "this is insufficient to conclude whether larger colliding systems behave differently . at higher energies ,",
    "there exist only the measurements of @xmath30 decay products  @xcite , nothing from hadronic interactions .",
    "star has measured the @xmath4  spectrum in 130 gev @xmath21+@xmath21 collisions using photon conversions ( @xmath31 ) in detector material  @xcite .",
    "while combinatorics leave the background under the @xmath4  mass peak too large for identifying individual pions , the reconstructed photons do have enough signal - to - noise to combine with other potential decay products , as is true with @xmath1  reconstruction in star . in the current @xmath2",
    "analysis , the topological similarities of photon conversions to @xmath32 ( weak ) decays was used to reconstruct the photons .",
    "two aspects uniquely identify the conversions : daughter @xmath25e@xmath33 characteristics of electrons , and very low values for the armenteros - podolanski decay variable @xmath34 .",
    "the electron @xmath25e@xmath33 band crosses other @xmath25e@xmath33 bands in the low momentum range of interest , so a cut on low @xmath34  is more stringent .",
    "only star data collected from minimum bias 200 gev @xmath25+@xmath21 collisions has shown sufficiently low combinatoric backgrounds along with adequate statistics to reconstruct a signal .",
    "clear evidence of the @xmath2  is shown from 14.7 million minimum bias events in fig .",
    "[ fi : data](a ) for rapidities between @xmath35 over all @xmath10 .",
    "a background shape has been determined by rotating @xmath2  daughter candidates about the beam axis .",
    "systematic errors derived from varying fit functions and ranges are dominated by statistical errors .",
    "the resulting reconstructed counts ( uncorrected for efficiency ) from four @xmath10 bins of @xmath2+@xmath36 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fi : data](b ) . using the uncorrected counts over all @xmath10 we find @xmath37 .",
    "future analyses will benefit from using the more efficient @xmath6-finder used in the @xmath4  analysis , for which reconstruction efficiencies are better understood .",
    "= 4.5 in = 4.5 in    weak decay contributions to the measurable @xmath2  yield are minor , with @xmath38 and @xmath39 each adding much less than 1% of their own ( relatively small ) yields .",
    "strong decay contributions may be more significant , including @xmath40 of the @xmath0(1385 ) , 100% and 40% of @xmath1(1405 ) and @xmath1(1520 ) decays , and uncertain fractions of heavier @xmath0  and @xmath1  excited states .",
    "measurements of the @xmath0(1385 ) yield in high energy nuclear collisions by star  @xcite will likely aid our understanding of @xmath2  sources .",
    "we have observed a signal for ( anti)@xmath2  in star for minimum bias 200 gev @xmath25+@xmath21 collisions at midrapidity , and expect to improve it via a different @xmath6-finder which has shown higher efficiencies , such that a yield can be measured",
    ". finding yields in other colliding systems may also be possible with further data acquired by star : improved statistics of 200 gev @xmath21+@xmath21 data from 2004 may overcome the large combinatorial background in that data ; 62 gev @xmath21+@xmath21 data taken in 2004 is expected to have reduced combinatorial background , as should @xmath41+@xmath41 data to be taken in 2005 ; and future @xmath13+@xmath13 runs should provide sufficient statistics to observe the ( anti)@xmath2  signals .",
