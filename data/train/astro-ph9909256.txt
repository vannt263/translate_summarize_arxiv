    "galaxies with radio jets are enigmatic objects",
    ". the sizes of the radio jets can reach up to @xmath2 mpc .",
    "yet the central ` engine ' which powers the radio jets resides at the center of the galaxy in an active region @xmath3 pc in radius : the spatially unresolved agn .",
    "the energy for the huge radio jets ( with luminosities as large as @xmath4 w between 10 mhz and 100 ghz ) is generally believed to be produced by the accretion of matter onto a central super - massive black hole ( hereafter bh ) ( e.g. , rees 1984 ; see lynden - bell 1996 for a historical overview ) .",
    "this view is supported e.g. by short time - scale variability of the central x - ray sources detected in active galaxies ( e.g. , wagner and witzel 1995 for a review ) , and by the detection of super - massive black holes in several nearby active and normal galaxies ( e.g. , ford 1998 ; ho 1998 ; richstone 1998 ; van der marel 1998 for summaries and reviews of recent results ) . within this paradigm there",
    "remain many fundamental unanswered questions concerning the formation and evolution of agn in radio - loud galaxies .",
    "for instance , what triggers the formation of a radio jet ?",
    "why are powerful radio jets always found in early - type galaxies rather than in spirals ?",
    "why do we see radio jets only in a few percent of early - type galaxies ?",
    "what is the origin of the material falling on to the bh ?",
    "is it obtained from the host galaxy itself or is it obtained by merging or galaxy harassment ?",
    "what is the ` feeding ' mechanism of the massive bh : how did the accreted material loose its angular momentum ? and finally , what causes the collimation of the jets ?",
    "radio emission is observed from the cores of a considerable fraction ( at least 20% at @xmath5 and 50% at @xmath6 ) of all early - type galaxies ( e.g. , sadler 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "only a few of these galaxies also show radio jets .",
    "ground - based studies of nearby galaxies with radio jets have shown that they are predominantly ellipticals with luminosity @xmath7 ( e.g. , owen and laing 1989 ) .",
    "they tend to be less flattened than normal galaxies ( hummel 1983 ; disney 1984 ) , and tend to have boxy isophotes ( bender 1989 ) . at equal luminosity ,",
    "s0 galaxies are a factor ten weaker radio emitters than elliptical galaxies ( hummel & kotanyi 1982 ; cordey 1986 ) .",
    "radio - loud early - type galaxies show dust more than twice as often than their normal counterparts ( van dokkum & franx 1995 ) .",
    "the dust distributions appear to be broadly perpendicular to the radio jet axis ( kotanyi & ekers 1979 ; de koff 1999 ) .    with the advent of hst",
    "the central regions of galaxies have been studied in the optical with unprecedented high resolution .",
    "studies of samples of nearby normal dust - free ellipticals reported a dichotomy in the types of central surface brightness profiles ( e.g. , jaffe 1994 ; lauer 1995 ) .",
    "some galaxies have surface brightness profiles , @xmath8 , with @xmath9 ( i.e. , a steep cusp ) while others have profiles with @xmath10 ( i.e. , a shallow cusp ) .",
    "high - luminosity galaxies ( m@xmath11 ) predominantly have shallow cusps while lower luminosity galaxies predominantly have steep central cusps .",
    "however , a study of the nuclei of ellipticals with counter rotating cores ( carollo 1997 ) suggests a rather smooth transition zone between the two classes instead of a bimodal distribution .",
    "the central regions of both normal and radio - loud galaxies turned out to be a diverse and complex environment .",
    "small nuclear gas and dust disks with sizes of a few hundred parsec were discovered in several galaxies ( jaffe 1993 ; de juan 1996 ; baum 1997 ; van der marel & van den bosch 1998 ; de koff 1999 ) . the central gas disks in m 87 ( ford 1994 ) and m 84 ( bower 1997 ) were studied in detail .",
    "they both lie in an irregular dust and gas distribution already known from ground - based work ( e.g. , kormendy & stauffer 1987 ) .",
    "super - massive bhs were detected by modeling the kinematics of the nuclear emission - line disks in m 87 ( harms 1994 ) , ngc 4261 ( ferrarese 1996 ) , m 84 ( bower 1998 ) and ngc 7052 ( van der marel & van den bosch 1998 ) .",
    "previously unknown optical jets were detected in several nearby radio - loud galaxies ( e.g. , sparks 1994 ; baum 1997 , martel 1998 ) .",
    "bh masses display a roughly linear correlation with total luminosity of the host bulge ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ; van der marel 1998 ) , but there is an observational bias against detecting small bhs in big galaxies , as well as a large scatter at fixed luminosity . the absolute magnitude for the four nearby radio - loud galaxies in which bhs were found varies by only 0.2 while their bh masses differ by a factor @xmath12 and their radio power varies by a factor @xmath13 .    given the hst results for nearby normal galaxies and the variety of features observed in radio galaxies , it is important to survey the central regions of nearby radio - loud galaxies in a systematic and unbiased way . how do the central regions of radio - loud early - types differ from the central regions of their radio - quiet and normal counterparts",
    "what is the range of inner slopes of the luminosity profiles",
    "? are there ` reservoirs ' of matter such as disks of gas and dust in all radio - loud galaxies ? how do the properties of the dust and gas distributions , such as mass , kinematics and orientation , correlate with the properties of the radio jets ?",
    "how do the inner radio jets and the central interstellar medium ( hereafter ism ) interact ?",
    "what is the relation between optical luminosity , radio luminosity and bh mass for radio - loud galaxies ?",
    "answers to the above questions require a systematic and observationally unbiased approach .",
    "therefore we defined a complete sample of 21 nearby radio - loud early - type galaxies limited in radio - flux and redshift ( see sec .",
    "[ s_sample ] ) .",
    "we carried out a program to obtain images for 19 galaxies . for six of those galaxies we use archival hst data .",
    "we obtained broad - band @xmath0 and @xmath1 images to study the central light distributions , color and the distribution of dust .",
    "we also obtained narrow - band images centered on the  emission lines to probe the emission gas at the centers of these galaxies .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present the sample and the observations , to describe in detail the data reduction and to give a preliminary analysis of the dust and gas emission for the 19 galaxies . in a subsequent paper",
    "we will present a detailed analysis of the properties of the centers of these galaxies and their relation to the nuclear activity .",
    "studies of the same sample at radio and x - ray frequencies are described in xu ( 1999a , b ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s_observations ] we introduce the sample and describe the observations and reduction of the images .",

    "[ s_emission ] and for the dust analysis in sec .",
    "[ s_dust ] .",
    "a summary of the results and conclusions is given in sec  [ s_summary ] .",
    "a description for the individual galaxies is given in appendix [ s_galaxies ] and details on the derivation of optical depths is given in appendix [ s_opt_depth ] .    throughout the paper we use a hubble constant @xmath14= 75 kms@xmath15mpc@xmath15 .",
    "our objective was to select a well - defined complete sample of nearby galaxies with radio jets to study in a systematic way and with high spatial resolution their central properties .",
    "the complete sample is drawn from a catalog of 176 radio - loud galaxies constructed by condon & broderick ( 1988 , hereafter cb88 ) .",
    "the catalog was constructed by position coincidence of radio identifications in the green bank 1400 mhz sky maps ( condon & broderick 1985 , 1986 ; cb88 ) and galaxies in the _ uppsala general catalogue of galaxies _ ( nilson 1973 , hereafter referred to as ugc ) .",
    "our sample consists of all galaxies in the cb88 sample which meet the following requirements : ( 1 ) hubble type classification e or s0 , ( 2 ) recession velocity @xmath16 , ( 3 ) optical major axis diameter @xmath17 ( this requirement follows from the ugc ) , ( 4 ) flux density @xmath18 mjy at 1400 mhz , ( 5 ) @xmath19 , ( 6 ) having a ` monster ' rather than a starburst energy source , as discerned from the iras / radio flux ratio ( cb88 ) and ( 7 ) a radio size @xmath20 as measured from 1490 mhz vla a array maps ( see xu 1999a for a detailed description of the radio properties of the sample ) .",
    "the last requirement was chosen to ensure we only selected galaxies with radio jets .",
    "the resulting sample consists of 21 galaxies .",
    "distances to the galaxies range between 15 mpc and 90 mpc .",
    "the sample covers a range of two magnitudes in absolute blue luminosity and a factor @xmath21 in radio - power ( fig .",
    "[ f_lum ] ) .",
    "the complete sample of galaxies is listed in table  [ t_sample ] , together with some general properties .",
    "all galaxies are classified as fanaroff & riley ( 1974 ) type",
    "i ( fr i ) galaxies ( xu 1999a ) .",
    "we observed 14 galaxies with the wfpc2 on board hst using the two broad - band filters f555w and f814w and 15 galaxies with a narrow - band filter centered on the  emission lines .",
    "no hst data were taken for ugc 7115 and ugc 12064 .",
    "for the remaining galaxies we used archival data with filters matching as closely as possible our program filters .",
    "the f555w / f547 m and f814w / f791w filters correspond closely to the johnson @xmath0- and cousins @xmath1-band , respectively .",
    "thus in total we have broad and narrow band observations for 19 of our 21 galaxies .",
    "table [ t_obs ] lists the observational setup for all exposures .",
    "the point spread function ( hereafter psf ) of the wfpc2 images has a typical fwhm @xmath22 .",
    "all observations were taken with the telescope guiding in fine lock , which typically gives an rms tracking - error of @xmath23 .",
    "a detailed description of the wfpc2 instrument is given in the wfpc2 instrument handbook version 4.0 ( biretta 1996 ) .",
    "all images were calibrated with the standard wfpc2 pipeline using the most up - to - date calibration observations .",
    "this pipeline and other reduction tasks are available in the iraf stsdas package .",
    "we refer to the hst data handbook version 3.1 ( ed .",
    "voit 1998 ) for a detailed description of the calibration process .    for each broad - band filter two images were taken back to back to allow for cosmic - ray removal .",
    "for the narrow - band and lrf images , which have significantly longer exposure times , 3 or 4 images were taken back to back .",
    "we added the images and removed cosmic - rays with the ` crrej ' task using an appropriate noise model for the wpfc2 .",
    "next we removed ` hot ' pixels from the images using the ` warmpix ' task .",
    "we then interpolated over remaining bad pixels using the ` wfixup ' task .",
    "the final images are shown in figure [ f_ima ] .",
    "we checked the alignment between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 band images using galactic stars and/or globular clusters .",
    "if these objects could not be used we checked the alignment using the galaxy nucleus .",
    "only a small sub - pixel shift was performed in one case ( ngc 4261 ) .",
    "all other images were aligned within 0.2 pixels ( i.e. @xmath24 ) and therefore no shifts for further alignment were performed .",
    "we used the ` ellipse ' task to perform isophotal fits to the light distributions of our targets .",
    "a detailed description of the method is given by jedrzejewski ( 1987 ) .",
    "we identified regions on the ccd which were not to be considered in the isophotal fitting procedure .",
    "these regions contain foreground stars , companion galaxies , globular clusters or regions affected by dust .",
    "the latter were identified by eye using the ratio of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 images in which local dust distributions clearly show up due to the differential opacity . however",
    ", this method is not sensitive to global smooth distributions of dust which might be present .",
    "a first fit was performed to the light distribution allowing center , position angle and ellipticity to vary freely for each radius . from these fits we determined the center of the luminosity distribution by taking the average of the center of ellipses within a certain radial range .",
    "a second fit was then performed but now with the center fixed during the fitting process .",
    "this procedure was performed separately on both the @xmath0- and @xmath1-band image for each galaxy .",
    "additionally , the isophotal shape parameters determined for the @xmath1-band image were then used to determine the luminosity profile for the @xmath0-band image using these same parameters .",
    "we compared the resulting position angle ( hereafter pa ) , ellipticity and fourier coefficients from these different fitting procedures .",
    "only insignificant differences were found which are likely due to low - level small dust features which could not be detected by inspecting the ratio image of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we derived a model for the galaxy from the isophotal fits , using the ` bmodel ' task .",
    "we inspected the residuals between these model galaxies and the real galaxy image , and verified that the isophotal fits were indeed an accurate representation of the real galaxy . for several galaxies the dust distributions inhibited a free isophotal fit to the central regions . in these regions",
    "we fixed the isophotal parameters to the last isophotal fit performed just outside the dust region .",
    "hence these inner surface brightness profiles are severely affected by dust obscuration . for the broad - band images it was not possible to determine the sky brightness from the pc images since the whole area of the pc chip and sometimes the wf chips as well were affected by light from the galaxies .",
    "we fitted a de vaucouleurs profile to the region where the light contribution from the sky was negligible and extrapolated this profile to the regions on the wf chips affected by sky light .",
    "thus the sky counts were defined as the difference between the observed counts and counts predicted from the extrapolation .",
    "the sky magnitudes have a narrow distribution around 22.5 mag arcsec@xmath25 in @xmath0 and 21.6 mag / arcsec@xmath25 in @xmath1 .",
    "the error in the sky counts is estimated to be 25% .",
    "we subtracted the sky counts from the surface brightness profile and determined @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes using the ` synphot ' task which yield typical errors in the absolute calibration of @xmath26 .",
    "corrections were made for galactic foreground extinction using optical extinction values @xmath27 given by ned which range between 0.0 and 0.44 .",
    "the final luminosity profiles agree well with those inferred from ground - based data ( see appendix [ s_galaxies ] ) .",
    "the derived isophotal parameters for the sample are shown in figure [ f_photoma ] .      _ luminosity profiles _ + the luminosity profiles of galaxies with negligible or no dust affecting",
    "their isophotes clearly show a break radius at which the profile flattens off towards the center .",
    "what can we say about the luminosity profiles affected by dust obscuration ? to get an indication we constructed ` un - extincted ' luminosity profiles in figure [ f_photoma ] , using several assumptions .",
    "we assume that ( i ) the dust is distributed in a screen with a fixed fraction @xmath28 of the total stellar light along the line of sight in front of it , ( ii ) the intrinsic color of the galaxy in the dust affected region is equal to the one just outside the dusty region ( a plausible assumption based on the color profiles of galaxies without central dust ) and ( iii ) a galactic extinction law is valid .",
    "we can then use the color excess to derive the optical depth ( see appendix [ s_opt_depth ] ) and hence the un - extincted surface brightness .",
    "figure  [ f_dustcorrect ] shows the extinction in @xmath0 magnitudes due to dust obscuration as function of observed color - excess for different screen positions .",
    "this figure illustrates that the observed color - excess provides a constraint on the un - extincted surface brightness only when @xmath28 is known a priori . in reality",
    ", the distribution of the dust will certainly be more complex than that of a simple screen . to give nevertheless an indication of the possible corrections to the observed surface brightness profiles we plotted in figure [ f_photoma ] the un - extincted profiles assuming a front - screen ( i.e. , @xmath28=0 ; dashed line ) and a ` mid - screen ' ( i.e. , d=0.5 ; dotted lines ) . one of the mid - screen un - extincted profiles is almost identical to the front screen approximation ( cf .",
    "figure  [ f_dustcorrect ] ) .",
    "only color excess values in the range @xmath29 $ ] can be observed for the mid - screen assumption ( cf .",
    "figure  [ f_dustcorrect ] .",
    "the observed color excess in the central regions of the sample galaxies lies in most cases exactly within this range .",
    "this indicates that the screen approximations are at least consistent with the observed extinction .",
    "our method is formally only correct if we observe a constant color - excess along each isophote .",
    "this is generally not true .",
    "however , simulations show that under the screen assumptions the method recovers the correct un - extincted isophotal magnitude to within @xmath30 for the typical observed color excess variations along isophotes .",
    "the un - extincted profiles show that the majority of the galaxies which do not show a break likely do have a break in their profile at some radius inside the dust affected region .",
    "but there are at least 2 galaxies ( ngc 2329 and ngc 4335 ) for which a power - law all the way into the central region is probable assuming the central dust is located near the center of the galaxy",
    ". these two galaxies also have a high central surface brightness which is typical for galaxies with a steep central cusp . the absolute magnitudes in our sample scatter around the dividing range of magnitudes between ` cuspy ' and ` shallow ' cores ( faber 1997 ) .",
    "hence it would be interesting to determine the distribution of central cusp slopes and break radii .",
    "this is not possible with our optical imaging due to the central dusty regions but requires high resolution near - infrared imaging .",
    "from the current data we can conclude that although obscuration by dust inhibits a direct determination of central cusp slopes , the data suggest most but not all galaxies have shallow cores .    _ color profiles _ + the @xmath31 color profiles ( fig .  [ f_photoma ] )",
    "provide limited information on the color of the stellar populations . in the inner regions most of our galaxies",
    "are severely affected by dust while in the outer regions the errors due to uncertain sky subtraction become large . the central color just outside the dust distributions in our sample range between 1.25 and 1.45 .",
    "this agrees well with @xmath31 colors reported in other studies of giant ellipticals ( bender and mllenhoff 1987 ; carollo 1997 ) .",
    "therefore we can only conclude that the sample galaxies have @xmath31 colors typical for giant ellipticals .",
    "_ position angles _ + the variation of the position angle of the stellar isophotes over the measured range of radii is less than @xmath32 for @xmath33 of the galaxies .",
    "the other half displays significantly larger isophotal twists",
    ". these could be due to low ellipticity and/or very shallow luminosity profiles .",
    "an additional possibility is the presence of small low - level dust obscuration which can not be detected from our @xmath0-@xmath1 image and hence were missed during the masking ( e.g. , possibly in ngc 5127 ) .",
    "two galaxies , ugc 1841 and ngc 7626 , show large twists which are undoubtly real ( see also sections [ s_1841 ] and [ s_7626 ] ) .",
    "pa twists might be caused by either triaxiality or gravitational interaction .",
    "_ ellipticities _ + using galaxy models we tested how the ellipticity of the inner isophotes is affected by the convolution with the psf of hst .",
    "it turns out that this effect is negligible outside @xmath34 for our sample galaxies . in @xmath35 35% of the galaxies",
    "the ellipticity varies by 0.1 or more in the inner @xmath36 .",
    "another @xmath35 30% show variations between 0.05 and 0.1 .",
    "the remaining @xmath35 35% have variations less than 0.05 .",
    "we compared this with ellipticity variations in the inner @xmath36 of 41 radio - quiet , giant elliptical galaxies ( i.e. , @xmath37 ) , based on hst studies published by lauer ( 1995 ) and carollo ( 1997 ) . for this sample of normal galaxies @xmath35 45% , @xmath35 40% and @xmath35 15% show variations larger than 0.1 , between 0.05 and 0.1 and less than 0.05 , respectively .",
    "thus radio - loud galaxies tend to have less variation in their ellipticity profiles in the inner @xmath36 .",
    "however , this difference might be ( partly ) caused by the higher frequency of central dust in the inner few arcseconds in our radio - loud sample which could conceal variations .    _ fourier coefficients _ + the fourth order fourier coefficient , @xmath38 , describes the deviations of the isophotes from perfect ellipses .",
    "negative values of @xmath38 indicate ` boxy ' isophotes while positive values indicate ` disky ' isophotes . in our sample departures from 0 are generally small ( i.e. @xmath39 ) in the inner regions but sometimes persist over several arcseconds .",
    "there are two notable exceptions : ugc 1841 becomes very disky around @xmath36 and ngc 4261 is very boxy outward of @xmath40 . in our sample",
    "there are roughly equal numbers of galaxies with positive , negative @xmath38 and no departures .",
    "bender ( 1989 ) found that radio - loud galaxies tend to have ` boxy ' isophotes at radii larger than several arcseconds .",
    "interestingly , this is clearly not the case for the central few arcseconds of our radio - loud galaxies .",
    "the sample of bender includes all galaxies in our sample which are boxy but does not include most of the galaxies with elliptical or disky isophotes .",
    "we compared our central @xmath38 values with profiles beyond @xmath41 reported in previous studies ( see section  [ s_galaxies ] ) . in all but one of these the isophotal shapes",
    "are either similar or boxier at @xmath42 than in the central region .",
    "the one exception is ngc 541 .",
    "to derive the flux from the  emission lines we subtracted the contribution of stellar continuum light from the narrow band ( i.e. , the ` on - band ' ) fluxes .",
    "we used the @xmath0- and @xmath1-band as ` off - band ' images to estimate this continuum .",
    "using these off - bands poses two potential problems .",
    "first , regions with gas emission are often affected by dust which has an opacity varying with wavelength . however , by estimating the continuum light distribution in the narrow - band images from a combination of the broad - band images on either side of the h@xmath43 frequency we are able to make a correction for the effects of dust as explained in more detail below .",
    "second , the @xmath0-band filters include several emission lines ( e.g. , the far end of the f555w filter includes the emission lines ) .",
    "the @xmath1-band filters do not contain emission lines .",
    "we determined the contribution of emission - line flux to the stellar flux in the @xmath0 band filters using our determined fluxes and assuming for each galaxy liner emission - line ratios as found for m 87 by dopita ( 1997 ) .",
    "the emission flux contributes at most 2.5% and is thus negligible . for ngc 4261",
    "we used the f675w @xmath44-band image from the archive to measure the emission flux since no hst narrow - band observation is available .",
    "this passband includes also the [ oi]@xmath456300 , 6364 and [ sii]@xmath456717 , 6731 lines .",
    "for this galaxy , the latter lines contribute 50% of the emission - line flux in f675w ( using again the m 87 line ratios ) .",
    "we did not make corrections for the slightly narrower and broader psf of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 filters , respectively , compared to the psf of the narrow - band filter .",
    "we verified that by using the combination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 images as off - band image , these psf differences alter the emission flux values by less than 5% .",
    "first the broad - band images were aligned with the narrow - band image , using foreground stars and globular clusters or companion galaxies . in a few cases where these reference points were not available we assumed that the isophotal center of the narrow- and broad - band images coincide . for targets with narrow - band images on the wf2 we rebinned the broad - band images on the pc to the larger wf pixel scale . from isophotal fits we determined the ratio between the on- and off - band fluxes in regions devoid of emission - line gas and dust .",
    "these ratios could be well fitted as a linear function of radius .",
    "thus we could extrapolate this linear fit to regions with gas emission .",
    "we determined the observed emission flux @xmath46 using the following equation : @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the flux measured through filter @xmath49 with @xmath50 denoting the narrow - band filter .",
    "the parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the ratios of the continuum light in the narrow - band and the @xmath0- and @xmath1-band , respectively , and vary with radius .",
    "next we explain that by using this combination of @xmath0 and @xmath1 as off - band we make a correction for the differential opacity at @xmath0 , @xmath50 and @xmath1 . to include the obscuration by dust we can write the more general version of eq .",
    "( [ e_emi1 ] ) as : @xmath53 here the correction factors @xmath54 indicate the ratio between observed and intrinsic flux through filter _",
    "j_. if one assumes a ` front screen ' of dust @xmath54 becomes : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the opacity coefficient for filter @xmath49 .",
    "if we define the ` total extinction factor ' @xmath57 as : @xmath58 and we take @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 ( consistent with a galactic extinction law normalized to @xmath0 ) , then @xmath57 equals exactly 1 regardless of optical depth and eq .",
    "( [ e_emi2 ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( [ e_emi1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath57 remains within 2% percent of 1 for reasonable values of @xmath62 if one assumes the dust screen is placed in the middle of the galaxy ( i.e. , 50% of the stellar light originates in front and behind the screen ) or if one assumes the dust is homogeneously mixed along the line of sight ( see fig .  [ f_extemi ] ) . for the latter two dust configurations the use of eq .",
    "( [ e_emi1 ] ) yields an under - estimate of the emission flux in areas affected by dust .",
    "the absolute flux calibration for the narrow - band filters for each galaxy was determined with the ` synphot ' package which models the throughput for the hst filters and assuming all lines have zero width .",
    "the final  emission images are shown in figure [ f_ima ] .",
    "the derived fluxes are summarized in table [ t_emi ] .",
    "derived luminosities are typical for fr i galaxies ( e.g. , zirbel & baum 1995 ) .",
    "all galaxies clearly show compact  emission in their nucleus .",
    "in addition , some galaxies show extended low - surface - brightness emission features almost always associated with dust .",
    "individual descriptions of the morphology of the emission gas can be found in appendix [ s_galaxies ] ) .",
    "four remarks can be made concerning the final flux values .",
    "first , all emission fluxes are _ observed _ fluxes , i.e. , are not corrected for extinction by dust .",
    "we did not attempt to correct for extinction because we can not reliably determine the distribution of dust relative to the emission gas .",
    "however , when we assume a front - screen of dust we can determine the amount of extinction using the observed @xmath31 color - excess per pixel in each galaxy ( see appendix  [ s_opt_depth ] .",
    "it turns out that in this configuration the intrinsic flux can be typically at most 40% larger than the observed flux .",
    "second , given the typical @xmath63 of the emission images , we are only able to detect emission features with a surface brightness larger than @xmath64 ergs@xmath15cm@xmath25arcsec@xmath25 . thus extended low - surface - brightness features below this level will be undetected but might make up for a significant fraction of the total emission when integrated over the galaxy .",
    "third , some galaxies reveal a nuclear point source that is bluer than the surrounding stellar light ( see section  [ s_galaxies ] . we did not adjust @xmath66 and @xmath67 for this .",
    "we verified that this results in an over - estimate of the total absolute flux up to @xmath68 , assuming that the blue point source is caused by the contribution of a non - stellar continuum flux which results in the observed color .",
    "fourth , the lrf , f658 , f673 filters have equivalent widths of @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively and therefore a fraction of broad - line  emission , if present , might fall outside the latter two passbands .",
    "we compared the derived fluxes with values from the literature ( see table [ t_emi ] ) .",
    "the fluxes agree reasonably well except for two galaxies : ngc 741 and ngc 7626 . for ngc 741 macchetto ( 1996 )",
    "report an extended disk of emission .",
    "the average flux - density in this disk is well below our detection threshold .",
    "we could not find a reason for the discrepancy of ngc 7626 .",
    "dust is detected in 17 out of the 19 radio galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the frequency of 72% @xmath72 16% found by van dokkum & franx ( 1995 ) for another sample of radio galaxies imaged with hst .",
    "both galaxies without detected dust , ngc 741 and ngc 2892 , are relatively far away . however , the minimal size of detected dust in our sample is 200 pc , which would still be resolved with hst ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 for ngc 741 and ngc 2892 , respectively ) .",
    "it is possible that the location and/or optical depth of the dust feature produces too little reddening to be detected .",
    "both galaxies are round ellipticals with large shallow cores ( similar to m 87 which itself has little dust ) .",
    "they are also the only two galaxies in the sample with a very nearby apparent companion ( angular separation @xmath75 ) .",
    "both companions are featureless round ellipticals .",
    "these similarities suggest there may be similar reasons for not detecting the dust ; either projection effects , or dust destroying processes in the galaxy itself , or tidal interaction with the companion . in this respect",
    "it is also noteworthy that macchetto ( 1996 ) did report a disk of gas emission in ngc 741 .",
    "the dust properties are summarized in table [ t_dust ] .",
    "there appear to be two distinct main classes of apparent ( i.e. , projected ) dust morphologies : lanes and disks .",
    "to what extent is this distinction intrinsic or just due to different viewing angles ?",
    "we found several differences which point in the direction of an intrinsic different morphology .",
    "the classification is robust : observed morphologies fall clearly in either classification bin . only for ngc 5490",
    "is the classification ambiguous but this is due to the very small size of the dust feature .",
    "the disks have a quite ` smooth ' appearance .",
    "their outlines closely resemble ellipses with sometimes spiral structures inside and small protuberances on the outside .",
    "lanes have a quite irregular appearance .",
    "they show warps or bends and are often surrounded by secondary filaments and patches of dust .",
    "dust disks tend to be closely aligned with the major axis of the stellar distribution while dust lanes do not display a clear preference of orientation ( fig .",
    "[ f_phi ] ) . in summary : there are various indications that the morphological difference between dust disks and lanes is intrinsic",
    ".    physical sizes of the dust features range from 200 pc to 4.5 kpc .",
    "dust features are typically smaller than @xmath76 .",
    "the few features larger in size all show peculiar morphologies compared to the sub - kpc morphologies .",
    "this suggests that at least some of the larger dust features are still settling towards stable orbits .",
    "physical sizes do not depend on the distance of the galaxy which suggests that our capability in detecting the dust features does not strongly depend on distance .",
    "there is also no indication of a correlation between size and morphology : both lanes and disks of similar sizes are present .    in general the minor axis of both lanes and disks",
    "appears to align roughly with the radio - jet axis ( fig .",
    "[ f_phi ] ) .",
    "a notable exception is ngc 7052 which has a misalignment of @xmath77 . in ngc 3862 ( 3c 264 ) the optical jet interacts with the dust ( baum 1998 ) which implies a large misalignment assuming the dust disk is physically thin . at the scales of 100 pc or larger ,",
    "as detected here , the orientation of the dust lanes is influenced by the gravitational potential and by the pressure gradients of the hot gas .",
    "the relative importance of these forces , the destruction time scales , and dynamical evolution ( i.e. , settling of the dust in stable morphologies ) are the factors determining the observed ( mis)alignments ( e.g. , quillen & bower 1999 ) .",
    "an analysis of the dust dynamics falls outside the scope of this paper and is deferred to a subsequent paper .",
    "the dust masses were determined under the assumption that the dust is distributed in a screen at a given position with respect to the galaxy light .",
    "the dust mass @xmath78 is proportional to the optical extinction @xmath27 ( sadler & gerhard 1985 ; van dokkum & franx 1995 ) : @xmath79 here @xmath80 is the area of the dust feature , @xmath81 the visual mass absorption coefficient and @xmath82 the extinction coefficient at @xmath0 .",
    "the optical depth @xmath62 is determined as described in appendix [ s_opt_depth ] .",
    "we adopt the galactic value @xmath83 mag kpc@xmath84 since differences between the galactic and elliptical galaxy extinction curves are generally small ( goudfrooij 1994b ) .",
    "table [ t_dust ] lists the mass for two screen positions : in front of and halfway into the galactic light distribution .",
    "the dust mass increases typically by a factor of 3 by placing the screen halfway instead of in front of the light distribution .",
    "there are two other main uncertainties affecting the mass estimates .",
    "first , the dust geometry is certainly more complex than a simple screen at one location in the galaxy .",
    "second , there is no one - to - one connection between dust geometry and color excess ( witt 1992 ; witt & gordon 1996 and see also sec .  [ s_iso_res ] ) .",
    "therefore , the derived dust masses should be treated with caution and have mainly significance in a relative sense as a measure of the projected dust mass .",
    "dust masses are usually smaller than a few times @xmath85 .",
    "the more massive features show also the more extended peculiar morphologies , which are likely still settling down .",
    "we have presented hst / wfpc2 broad- and narrow - band observations of 19 radio - loud early - type nearby galaxies which are part of a complete sample of 21 nearby fanaroff & riley type i galaxies .",
    "we have described the data reduction , given isophotal fits and analysed the central emission - line gas and dust distributions .",
    "the general conclusion is that the centers of these fr i galaxies , apart from the ubiquitous presence of dust and gas distributions , resemble the centers of normal bright ellipticals .",
    "the galaxies have fairly round ( ellipticity @xmath86 ) stellar isophotes .",
    "our radio - loud early - type galaxies seem to have on average less variation in their ellipticity profiles in the inner @xmath36 compared to normal early - types of similar luminosity .",
    "however , this difference might be caused by the frequent obscuration by dust of the central regions of our sample galaxies .",
    "the shape of the isophotes is mostly close to perfect ellipsoidal ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "ground - based studies show that the isophotal shapes either remain similar or become boxier at radii beyond @xmath36 .",
    "the dust inhibits a direct measurement of the inner slope of the surface brightness profile .",
    "we applied simple models in which the dust is represented by a screen to estimate the possible range in slope for the un - extincted light profile in each galaxy .",
    "most galaxies have profiles which do flatten off towards the nucleus .",
    "two galaxies have light profiles which are consistent with a single power law slope .",
    "thus at this stage both shallow and cuspy cores seem able to host an active nucleus which produces radio jets .",
    "dust is detected in the cores of all but two sample galaxies .",
    "the dust morphology can be divided in three categories : disks , lanes and irregular distributions .",
    "both disks and lanes have sizes ranging from a few hundreds of parsec to a few kiloparsec .",
    "the major axis of the disks is always aligned within a few degrees with the galaxy major axis while lanes have misalignments of tens of degrees and often show twists and warps .",
    "therefore it is suggested that the difference between disks and lanes is intrinsic and not solely due to different viewing angles .",
    "the apparent major axis of both disks and lanes is generally roughly perpendicular to the radio jet axis .",
    "two notable exceptions are ngc 7052 and ngc 3862 . using the narrow - band observations , we detected emission - line gas in the nucleus of each galaxy in our sample .",
    "gas emission is also commonly associated with the dust distributions .",
    "the dust and gas in the cores of these fr i galaxies provides a natural fuel supply for the active nucleus .",
    "the question which then can be raised is why the fraction of normal early - type galaxies which do show similar dust distributions in their cores do not host an agn .",
    "do these galaxies lack a massive bh to accrete the material and convert the gravitational energy ? or is the fuel , although clearly present , not funneled effectively to the nucleus due to differences in the shape of the central gravitational potential well or differences in the ism ( e.g. , pressure ) ?",
    "thus it is important to perform a detailed comparitive study of these nearby active cores and normal quiescent cores . in this context",
    "we will obtain hst / stis observations for the nuclei of the complete radio - loud sample to study the state and kinematics of the emission gas and constrain the mass of the bh .",

    "the central emission gas was first studied with hst by ford ( 1994 ) and harms ( 1994 ) .",
    "an isophotal fit to our central emission features agrees very well with their results .",
    "studies of the emission - gas kinematics yield a black hole with a mass of @xmath154 ( harms 1994 ; macchetto 1997 ) .",
    "irregular spiral arms of emission extend from the disk and emission gas is associated with all dust features .",
    "dopita ( 1997 ) showed that the off - nucleus emission - gas has a liner spectrum and is excited by shocks .",
    "carter ( 1997 ) found evidence for many small dense clouds of gas in the core of m 87 with a velocity range @xmath155 kms using high resolution ground - based spectroscopy .",
    "the active nucleus in m 87 emits a non - stellar continuum which is reported to vary in strength over time in the optical ( tsvetanov 1998 ) and x - rays ( harris 1997 ) .",
    "the optical and radio jet have been studied extensively ( e.g. , meisenheimer 1996 for a recent review ; biretta 1998 ; perlman 1999 ) .",
    "m 87 has an apparent one - sided optical and radio jet but there are strong indications for a counter - jet ( sparks 1992 ; stiavelli 1992 , 1997 ) .",
    "our isophotal analysis is consistent with studies by ferrarese ( 1994 ) and peletier ( 1990 ) .",
    "the latter find that the ellipticity increases monotonically to 0.15 between @xmath36 and @xmath156 .",
    "this increase enables a more robust estimate of the pa for this region which decreases from @xmath157 to @xmath158 .",

    "ngc 5141 has two - sided radio jets with broad lobes ( xu 1999a ) .",
    "our isophotal analysis is consistent with a ground - based study by gonzlez - serrano ( 1993 ) .",
    "in contrast with our results , however , they report a sharper decrease in ellipticity inward of @xmath120 . this difference might be caused by their larger seeing and/or a distortion of the inner isophotes by the central dust distribution .",
    "ngc 5490 is the brightest galaxy in zwicky cluster 1407.6 + 1750 .",
    "there is a very small central dust distribution @xmath162 ( 170 pc ) in size with pa @xmath163 .",
    "it appears to be either a dust lane or a highly inclined disk .",
    "there is a compact central peak of   emission .",
    "ngc 5490 hosts a double - sided radio jet ( cb88 ; xu 1999a ) .",
    "our isophotal analysis agrees with a study by de juan ( 1994 ) .",

    "there is a large central dust disk with a diameter of 1 kpc ( @xmath165 ) ( de juan 1996 ) .",
    "the inner part of the dust disk hosts a small emission - gas disk and low - level emission is detected throughout the dust disk . by modeling the kinematics of the gas disk van der marel & van den bosch ( 1998 ) detected a black hole with a mass of @xmath166 .",
    "there is a dust protuberance , also seen in the emission image at the west end of the disk .",
    "hi was detected in emission blueshifted by @xmath167  with respect to the systemic velocity of the galaxy ( huchtmeier 1995 ) .",
    "the nucleus which is obscured by dust is slightly bluer than its surroundings .",
    "ngc 7052 hosts a narrow radio jet with a very weak counter jet ( morganti 1987 ; cb88 ; xu 1999a ) .",
    "our isophotal analysis agrees well with previous studies ( de juan ( 1994 ) ; van den bosch & van der marel 1995 ; van der marel & van den bosch 1998 ) .",

    "they are the two brightest ellipticals in the pegasus i cluster .",
    "ngc 7626 has a counter rotating core ( forbes 1995 ; carollo 1997 ) .",
    "there is a small warped dust lane ( diameter 230 pc/@xmath171 ) across the nucleus .",
    "interestingly the central part of the dust lane is perpendicular to the radio jet while the warped outer part aligns with the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "there is an unresolved nuclear emission peak and low - level emission gas is seen along the dust lane .",
    "ngc 7626 has double - sided radio lobes ( xu 1999a ) .",
    "our isophotal analysis is in good agreement with previous ground - based ( peletier 1990 ; de juan 1994 ) and hst studies ( carollo 1997 ) .",
    "the pa of the isophotes increases by @xmath172 in the central @xmath36 .",
    "forbes & thomson ( 1992 ) reported excess light in the galaxy which might be due to tidal interaction with ngc 7619 .",
    "following carollo ( 1997 ) , we derive the optical depth under the assumption that the dust distribution can be represented by a screen . for a dust screen at position @xmath28 relative to the distribution of light along the line of sight ( @xmath173 for a screen in front of the galaxy and @xmath174 behind the galaxy )",
    "we can write the ratio between intrinsic and observed fluxes as : @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the ratio of @xmath177 and @xmath178 , i.e. of the observed and intrinsic flux through filter @xmath49 ( @xmath179 ) , respectively .",
    "the extent and morphology of the dust distributions inhibit a direct estimate of these two ratios from our isophotal analysis to derive @xmath62 .",
    "however , the ratio @xmath180 of the un - extincted flux in @xmath0 and in @xmath1 ( i.e. , its color ) is well fitted as a slowly varying linear function of radius for the centers of these early - type galaxies .",
    "this fit can be extrapolated into regions affected by dust .",
    "thus we determine from our imaging the ratio @xmath181 between the un - extincted and observed color which can be written as : @xmath182 taking @xmath183 and @xmath184 ( consistent with galactic extinction ) and substituting @xmath185 , eq .",
    "( [ e_fluxratio2 ] ) becomes a second order equation which can be solved analytically for @xmath62 .",
