    "er uma stars are a subgroup of su uma - type dwarf novae ( for a review of dwarf novae , see @xcite ) , whose known members are er uma , v1159 ori , rz lmi , and di uma .",
    "the most striking feature of er uma stars is the extremely short recurrence time ( 1945 d ) of superoutbursts ( @xcite ; 1995a , b ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "another striking feature of er uma stars is the stability of supercycles , both in their lengths and outburst pattern .",
    "the best exemplification of this stability can be seen in folded light curves and @xmath1 figures presented in @xcite .",
    "the extremely short supercycle length and the stability of the outburst patterns are basically explained , within the framework of the disk - instability model , as a result of constant high mass - transfer rates from the secondary ( ) . the mass - transfer rates in su uma - type dwarf novae are generally considered to be confined to a small range determined by angular - momentum removal by the gravitational wave radiation .",
    "the origin of high - mass transfer rates in er uma stars is still an open question .",
    "some models assume irradiation effect from a hot white dwarf , which may be the result of a hypothetical recent nova eruption ( the possibility was originally raised by , see also @xcite ) .",
    "an examination of any secular changes in the supercycle in these systems would provide an essential clue for testing these hypotheses .",
    "we examined the observations posted to vsnet @xmath2http://www.kusastro.kyoto - u.ac.jp / vsnet/@xmath3 , and found an appreciable change in one of the er uma stars , v1159 ori . the object has been very well sampled by many observers around the world since 1995 september ( figure [ fig : figure1 ] ) .",
    "the time of the start of a superoutburst was defined as its mid - rising branch . although occasional observational gaps introduced an uncertainty of 12 d , most of these superoutbursts were well sampled and the times were usually determined within an uncertainty of 1 d. table [ tab : table1 ]",
    "lists the observed times of superoutbursts .",
    "the cycle number ( @xmath4 ) represents number of supercycles since the jd 2449982 superoutburst .",
    ".superoutbursts of v1159 ori . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ( 180mm,120mm)fig1.eps    .",
    "a regression to these times has yielded a linear ephemeris of @xmath5 .",
    "the derived supercycle length of 46.82 d is slightly longer than the 44.5 d by @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : figure2 ] shows the @xmath1 diagram against this ephemeris .",
    "the most remarkable feature is the presence of large @xmath1 changes compared to @xcite .",
    "this large change is mainly caused by an increase in the supercycle length between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , corresponding to the period between 1999 may and 2000 may .",
    "the supercycle during interval is 53.3 d , which is 14% longer than the long - term average .",
    "such a large change in supercycle has not been seen in er uma .",
    "( 80mm,60mm)fig2.eps    ( 140mm,90mm)fig3.eps",
    "the long - term average of the supercycle lengths in v1159 ori , being close to the minimum value predicted by ( ) , the supercycle length near this period is expected to be insensitive to the mass - transfer rate from the secondary .",
    "if the observed change in v1159 ori was caused by the variable mass - transfer rate , a relatively large change is necessary to reproduce the observation . using the @xmath8 diagram in ( )",
    ", a supercycle of 53.3 d corresponds to a reduction of @xmath040% of mass - transfer rates from what is expected for a 44.5-d supercycle .",
    "the marked reduction of the superoutburst duty cycle during this period ( figure [ fig : figure3 ] ) also supports this interpretation .",
    "another observational evidence of a large period change in er uma stars has been reported in di uma @xcite .",
    "however , the extreme shortness of supercycles in di uma and rz lmi requires an additional ( still poorly identified ) mechanism ( ) , and its change may be of different nature .",
    "another noteworthy feature in the observed @xmath1 diagram of v1159 ori is a possible periodicity with a period of @xmath038 cycles , corresponding to @xmath01800 d , rather than a monotonous change originally proposed by @xcite ; this is contrary to the expected effect by decreasing heating from a hypothetical recent nova eruption on a white dwarf .",
    "the observed possible long - term period is close to those observed as possible solar - type cycles in cataclysmic variables ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if such a  solar - type \" cycle is responsible for the change in the supercycle of v1159 ori , this may provide promising evidence for the presence of magnetic activity in dwarf novae below the period gap , which has usually been considered to cease , or to be markedly reduced , when the secondary becomes fully convective after crossing the period gap .",
    "furthermore , the continuing magnetic activity may be one of the mechanisms for effectively removing the angular momentum from the binary system , by which the required high mass - transfer in er uma - type systems may be partly explained .",
