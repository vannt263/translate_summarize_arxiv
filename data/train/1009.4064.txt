    "classical schur - weyl duality relates the representations of the symmetric and general linear groups via their actions on tensor space .",
    "the brauer algebra was introduced in @xcite to play the role of the symmetric group in a corresponding duality for the symplectic and orthogonal groups . over the complex numbers it is generically semisimple @xcite ,",
    "indeed it can only be non - semisimple if @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "building on work of doran , hanlon , and wales @xcite we determined , with martin , the blocks of the brauer algebra over @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this block structure could be defined in terms of the action of a weyl group of type @xmath2 @xcite , with a maximal parabolic subgroup of type @xmath3 determining the dominant weights .",
    "the corresponding alcove geometry has associated translation functors which can be used to provide morita equivalences between weights in the same facet @xcite .",
    "more recently , martin @xcite has shown that the decomposition numbers for the standard modules are given by the corresponding parabolic kazhdan - lusztig polynomials .",
    "the walled brauer algebra was introduced in another generalisation of schur - weyl duality , by changing the tensor space on which the symmetric group acts .",
    "if instead a mixed tensor space ( made of copies of the natural module and its dual ) is considered , then the walled brauer algebra plays the role of the symmetric group in the duality .",
    "this was introduced independently by a number of authors @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the walled brauer algebra was analysed in the same spirit as in @xcite , and the blocks were again described in terms of the action of a weyl group  but this time of type @xmath3 , with a maximal parabolic subgroup of type @xmath4 determining the dominant weights .",
    "the kazhdan - lusztig polynomials associated to @xmath5 and @xmath6 are two of the infinite families associated with hermitian symmetric spaces , and have already been considered by a number of authors .",
    "lascoux and schtzenberger @xcite considered the @xmath6 case and gave an explicit formula for the coefficients in terms of certain special valued graphs .",
    "this was extended to the other hermitian symmetric pairs by boe @xcite .",
    "a different combinatorial description was given by enright and shelton @xcite in terms of an associated root system .",
    "( a more general situation has also been considered by brenti @xcite who describes the corresponding polynomials in terms of shifted - dyck partitions . )",
    "the brauer and walled brauer algebras are examples of diagram algebras .",
    "a quite different diagram algebra was introduced by khovanov @xcite in his work on categorifying the jones polynomial .",
    "brundan and stroppel have studied generalisations of these algebras , relating them to a parabolic category @xmath7 and the general linear supergroup @xcite . along the way ,",
    "kazhdan - lusztig polynomials of type @xmath6 arise , and brundan and stroppel re - express the combinatorial formalism of lascoux and schtzenberger in terms of certain cap diagrams .    in this paper we will determine the decomposition numbers for the brauer and walled brauer algebras by analysing the blocks of these algebras in the ( combinatorial ) spirit of brundan and stroppel . for the brauer algebra",
    "we introduce certain curl diagrams which correspond to the graph formalism in boe , while the walled brauer algebra involves only cap diagrams .",
    "the decomposition numbers for the brauer algebra were determined by martin @xcite ; our methods give a uniform proof that includes the walled brauer case .",
    "one of the main organisational tools in our earlier work was the notion of a tower of recollement @xcite .",
    "we give a slight extension of our earlier theory of translation functors for such towers @xcite and use this to reduce the decomposition number problem to a combinatorial exercise .",
    "this is then solved using curl diagrams , thus giving a unified proof for the brauer and walled brauer cases .    in the brauer case",
    "the combinatorial construction is related to that given in @xcite .",
    "however , using cap and curl diagrams we are able to explicitly calculate certain inverses to the decomposition matrices for both brauer and walled brauer .",
    "the polynomial entries of these matrices can be used to describe projective resolutions of the standard modules in each case .",
    "( again , this is in the spirit of brundan and stroppel . )",
    "we begin in section [ basics ] with a brief review of the basics of brauer and walled brauer representation theory .",
    "section [ tor ] reviews ( and slightly extends ) the tower of recollement formalism , and the theory of translation functors in this context .",
    "sections [ capsec ] and [ twicapsec ] introduce two of the main combinatorial constructions : oriented cap and curl diagrams .",
    "these are used in section [ repthry ] to determine the decomposition numbers for our algebras .",
    "after providing a recursive formula for decomposition numbers in section [ recur ] we define a second family of polynomials using valued cap and curl diagrams in section [ vcap ] .",
    "these are used to determine projective resolutions of standard modules in section [ proj ] . finally , the relation between the polynomials associated to valued cap and curl diagrams and the construction of parabolic kazhdan - lusztig polynomials by lascoux - schtzenberger and boe is outlined in the appendix .",
    "we would like to thank paul martin for several useful discussions .",
    "we will review some basic results about the representations of the brauer and the walled brauer algebra .",
    "the two theories are very similar ; we will concentrate on the walled brauer ( which is less familiar ) and sketch the modifications required for the classical brauer algebra .",
    "details can be found in @xcite for the walled brauer algebra , and in @xcite otherwise .",
    "we will restrict attention to the case where the ground field is @xmath1 , and assume that our defining parameter @xmath8 is non - zero .",
    "let @xmath9 for some non - negative integers @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "for @xmath12 , the brauer algebra @xmath13 ( which we will often denote just by @xmath14 ) can be defined in terms of a basis of diagrams .",
    "we will consider certain rectangles with @xmath15 marked nodes on each of the northern and southern edges .",
    "brauer diagrams are then those rectangles in which all nodes are connected to precisely one other by a line .",
    "lines connecting nodes on the same edge are called arcs , while those connecting nodes on opposite edges are called propagating lines .",
    "multiplication of diagrams @xmath3 and @xmath16 is by concatenation , to form a diagram @xmath17 which may contain some number ( @xmath18 say ) of closed loops . to form a diagram in our basis we set @xmath17 equal to @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the diagram obtained from @xmath17 by deleting all closed loops .",
    "now decorate all brauer diagrams in @xmath21 with a vertical wall separating the first @xmath10 nodes on each edge from the final @xmath11 nodes on each edge .",
    "the walled brauer algebra @xmath22 ( or just @xmath23 ) is then the subalgebra of @xmath21 generated by those brauer diagrams in which arcs cross the wall , while propagating lines do not .    for @xmath24 let @xmath25 be @xmath26 times the diagram with all nodes connected vertically in pairs except for those adjacent to the wall , which are connected across the wall",
    "this is an idempotent , and we have an algebra isomorphism @xmath27 via this isomorphism we have an exact localisation functor @xmath28 taking a module @xmath29 to @xmath30 , and a right exact globalisation functor @xmath31 in the opposite direction taking a module @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "there is a similar idempotent @xmath34 and algebra isomorphism @xmath35 , giving rising to corresponding localisation and globalisation functors @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath38 denote the symmetric group on @xmath10 symbols , and set @xmath39 .",
    "there is an isomorphism @xmath40 and this latter algebra has simple modules labelled by @xmath41 , the set of pairs of partitions of @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively . by standard properties of localisation",
    "it follows that if @xmath42 then the set of simple modules for @xmath23 is labelled by @xmath43 as @xmath44 we deduce that @xmath45 consists of all pairs @xmath46 such that @xmath47 is a partition of @xmath48 and @xmath49 is a partition of @xmath50 for some @xmath51 .",
    "we say that such a bipartition is of degree @xmath52 , and put a partial order on degrees by setting @xmath53 if @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath56 denote the set of partitions of @xmath15 .",
    "then by similar arguments we see that the labelling set @xmath57 for simple @xmath21-modules is given recursively by @xmath58 and so @xmath57 consists of all partitions @xmath59 of @xmath60 for some @xmath51 .",
    "we say that such a partition is of degree @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath62 with @xmath63 induce a heredity chain in @xmath23 , and so we can apply the theory of quasihereditary algebras .",
    "in particular for each @xmath64 there is an associated standard module @xmath65 with simple head @xmath66 and projective cover @xmath67 .",
    "the standard modules have an explicit description in terms of walled brauer diagrams and specht modules for the various @xmath68 , and determining the decomposition numbers for these modules in terms of their simple factors is equivalent to determining the simple modules themselves . in the same way the @xmath21 are quasihereditary , with standard modules",
    "@xmath69 , with simple modules @xmath70 , and projective covers @xmath71 .    by general properties of our heredity chain we have @xmath72 and @xmath73 we define a partial order on the set of all partitions ( or all bipartitions ) by setting @xmath74 if @xmath75 .",

    "given such a box @xmath95 , we denote the associated partition by @xmath96 ( respectively @xmath97 ) . if we wish to emphasise that @xmath95 lies in a given row ( @xmath98 say ) then we may denote it by @xmath99 .    by (",
