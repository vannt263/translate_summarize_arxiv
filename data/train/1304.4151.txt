    "current power systems are continuously monitored and controlled by ems / scada ( energy management system and supervisory control and data acquisition ) systems in order to maintain the operating conditions in a normal and secure state @xcite . in particular , the scada host at the control center processes the received meter measurements using a state estimator , which filters the incorrect data and derives the optimal estimate of the system states .",
    "these state estimates will then be passed on to all the ems application functions , such as optimal power flow , etc , to control the physical aspects of the electrical power grids .",
    "however , the integrity of state estimation is under mounting threat as we gradually transform the current electricity infrastructures to future smart power grids , which are more open to the outside networks from the extensive use of internet - based protocols in the communication system . in particular , enterprise networks and even individual users",
    "are allowed to connect to the power network information infrastructure to facilitate data sharing @xcite . with these entry points introduced to the power system ,",
    "potential complex and collaborating malicious attacks are brought in as well .",
    "et al_.@xcite showed that a new false - data injection attack could circumvent bad data detection ( bdd ) in today s scada system and introduce arbitrary errors to state estimates without being detected .",
    "such an attack is referred to as an undetectable false - data injection attack .",
    "a recent experiment in @xcite demonstrates that the attack can cause a state - of - the - art ems / scada state estimator to produce a bias of more than @xmath0 of the nominal value without triggering the bdd alarm .",
    "biased estimates could directly lead to serious social and economical consequences .",
    "for instance , @xcite showed that attackers equipped with data injection can manipulate the electricity price in power market .",
    "worse still , @xcite warned that the attack can even cause regional blackout .",
    "being aware of its imminent threats to power system , a number of studies are devoted to both understanding its attacking patterns and providing effective countermeasures @xcite .",
    "a common approach to mitigate false - data injection attack is to secure meter measurements by , for example , guards , video monitoring , or tamper - proof communication systems , to evade malicious injections @xcite .",
    "recent studies have proposed a number of methods to select meter measurements for protection .",
    "for instance , @xcite proved that it is necessary and sufficient to protect a set of _ basic measurements _ so that no undetectable false - data injection attack can be launched .",
    "however , the protection scheme in @xcite is costly in that the size of a set of _ basic measurements _ is the same as the number of unknown state variables in the state estimation problem , which could be up to several hundred in a large - scale power system .",
    "under limited budget , the system operator should protect a subset of state variables .",
    "this is because an ill - advised protection method may leave the attackers the chance to formulate undetectable attack to compromise a large number of , if not all the state variables , even if many measurements have been secured @xcite . in this case",
    ", the system operator may give priority to protecting the state variables that have greater social / economic impact once compromised , such as those for critical buses / substations connected to heavily loaded or economically important areas , or with critical interconnection purposes @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , even if the system operator has enough budget to defend all the state variables , protecting a set of basic measurements in a random sequence may still open to attackers the possibility to compromise a large number of state variables during the lengthy security installation period . in both cases , it is valuable to devise a method that gives priority to defending a subset of state variables that serves our best interests at the current stage , and opens to the possibility of expanding the set of protected state variables in the future .    in this paper , we focus on using graphical methods to derive efficient strategies that defend any subset of state variables with minimum number of secure measurements .",
    "our detailed contributions are listed as follows ,    * we derive conditions to select a set of meter measurements , so that no undetectable attack can be launched to compromise a given set of state variables if the selected meters are secured .",
    "the conditions are particularly useful in formulating the optimal protection problem that defends the state variables with a minimum cost .",
    "* we characterize the optimal protection problem as a variant steiner tree problem in a graph .",
    "then , two exact solution methods are proposed , including a steiner vertex enumeration algorithm and a mixed integer linear programming ( milp ) formulation derived from a network flow model .",
    "in particular , the proposed milp formulation reduces the computational complexity by exploiting the graphical structure of the optimal solution . * to tackle the intractability of the problem",
    ", we also propose a polynomial - time tree - pruning heuristic ( tph ) algorithm . with a proper parameter ,",
    "simulation results show that it yields close - to - optimal solution , while significantly reducing the computational complexity .",
    "for instance , the tph solves a problem of a @xmath1-bus testcase in seconds , which may take days by the milp formulation .",
    "the proposed milp and tph algorithms can also be extended to achieve incremental protection .",
    "that is , starting from a set of protected state variables and measurements , the method can gradually expand the set of protected state variables until the entire set of state estimates is protected .",
    "the incremental protection method can be used to plan a long - term security upgrade project in a large - scale power system .",
    "state estimation protection is closely related to the concept of power network observability .",
    "the conventional power network observability analysis studies whether a unique estimate of all unknown state variables can be determined from the measurements @xcite . from the attacker s perspective , @xcite proved that an undetectable attack can be formulated if removing the measurements it compromises will make the power system unobservable .",
    "conversely , @xcite showed that no undetectable attack can be formulated if the power system is observable from the protected meter measurements . in this paper , we extend the conventional wisdom of power network observability to a generalized _ state variable observability _ to study the protection mechanisms for any set of state variables .    graphical method is commonly used for power system observability analysis .",
    "the early work by krumpholz _",
    "et al_.@xcite stated that a power system is observable if and only if it contains a spanning tree that satisfies certain measurement - to - transmission - line mapping rules .",
    "a follow - up work presented a max - flow method to find such mapping to examine the observability of a power network @xcite .",
    "few recent papers also applied graphical methods to study the attack / defending mechanisms of false - data injection .",
    "for instance , based on the results in @xcite , @xcite proposed an algorithm to quantify the minimum - effort undetectable attack , i.e. the non - trivial attack that compromises least number of meters without being detected . besides , @xcite used a min - cut relaxation method to calculate the security indices defined in @xcite to quantify the resistance of meter measurements in the presence of injection attack .",
    "similar min - cut approach was also applied in @xcite to identify the critical points in the measurement set , the loss of which would render the power system unobservable .",
    "the problem of defending a subset of critical state variables against undetectable attack was first studied in our earlier work @xcite , where we proposed an arithmetic greedy algorithm which finds the minimum set of protected meter measurements by gradually expanding the set of secure state variables .",
    "however , the computational complexity of the greedy algorithm can be prohibitively high in large scale power systems .",
    "for instance , it may take years to obtain a solution in a @xmath2-bus system .",
    "in contrast , we study in this paper the optimal protection from a graphical perspective . by exploiting the graphical structures of the optimal solution",
    ", the proposed milp formulation obtains the optimal solution with significantly reduced complexity .",
    "in addition , we also propose a pruning - based heuristic that yields near - optimal solutions in polynomial time .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce some preliminaries about state estimation and false - data injection attack . we characterize the optimal protection problem in a graph in section iii and propose solution algorithms in section iv . in section",
    "v , we discuss the methods to extend the proposed algorithms to some practical scenarios , including the method to achieve incremental protection .",
    "simulation results are presented in section vi . finally , the paper is concluded in section vii .",
    "we consider the linearized power network state estimation problem in a steady - state power system with @xmath3 buses .",
    "the states of the power system include the bus voltage phase angles and voltage magnitudes .",
    "the voltage magnitudes can often be directly measured , while the values of phase angles need to be obtained from state estimation @xcite . in the linearized ( dc ) measurement model",
    ", we assume the knowledge of voltage magnitudes at all buses ( @xmath4 in the per - unit system ) and estimate the phase angles based on the active power measurements , i.e. the active power flows along the power lines and active power injections at buses @xcite . by choosing an arbitrary bus as the reference with zero phase angle ,",
    "the network state consisting of the @xmath5 unknown voltage phase angles is captured in a vector @xmath6 . in the dc measurement model ,",
    "the @xmath7 received measurements @xmath8 are related to the network states as @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the measurement jacobian matrix @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 is independent measurement noise with covariance @xmath12 . using a @xmath13-bus power system in fig .",
    "@xmath14 for example . by setting bus @xmath4 as the reference bus",
    ", there are four unknown state variables .",
    "suppose that the reactance of all transmission lines equals @xmath4 , the measurement jacobian matrix is @xmath15 where the first @xmath16 rows correspond to flow measurements while the last two rows correspond to injection measurements .",
    "the four columns correspond to bus @xmath17 to @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "notice that the column corresponding to the reference bus is not included .",
    "when @xmath10 is full column rank , i.e. @xmath18 , the maximum likelihood estimate @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 since @xmath21 , i.e. the number of rows in @xmath10 , at least @xmath5 meters are needed to derive a unique state estimation .",
    "meanwhile , the other @xmath22 measurements provide the redundancy to improve the resistance against random errors .",
    "errors could be introduced due to various reasons , such as device misconfiguration and malicious attacks .",
    "the current power systems use bdd mechanism to remove the bad data assuming that the errors are random and unstructured .",
    "it calculates the residual @xmath23 and compares its @xmath24-norm with a prescribed threshold @xmath25 .",
    "a measurement @xmath26 is identified as a bad data measurement if @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an identity matrix .",
    "otherwise , @xmath26 is considered as a normal measurement .",
    "suppose that attackers inject malicious data @xmath29 into measurements .",
    "then , the received measurements become @xmath30 in general , @xmath31 is likely to be identified by the bdd if it is unstructured .",
    "nevertheless , it is found in @xcite that some well - structured injections , such as those with @xmath32 , can bypass bdd .",
    "here @xmath33 is a random vector .",
    "this can be verified by calculating the residual in ( [ 5 ] ) , where @xmath34 the same residual is obtained as if no malicious data were injected .",
    "therefore , a structured attack @xmath32 will not be detected by bdd . in this case",
    ", the system operator would mistake @xmath35 for a valid estimate , and thus an error vector @xmath36 has been introduced without being detected .",
    "the risks of undetectable attacks can be mitigated if the system operator can secure measurements to evade malicious injections . within this context , we assume that the system operator s objective is to ensure that no undetectable attack can be formulated to compromise a given set of state variables @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the set of all unknown state estimates",
    ". that is , @xmath39 for all @xmath40 .",
    "this is achieved by securing a set of meter measurements @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the set of all the meters . in other words",
    ", attackers are not able to inject false data to any protected meter measurement , i.e. @xmath43 , @xmath44 .    from @xcite , securing a set of meters @xmath45 would eliminate the possibility of undetectable attack to compromise a set of state variables @xmath46 , if and only if @xmath47 here , @xmath48 is the submatrix of @xmath10 including the rows that correspond to @xmath45 and @xmath49 is the submatrix of @xmath48 excluding the columns that correspond to @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath50 denotes the size of @xmath46 .",
    "naturally , we are interested in minimizing the cost to protect the state variables @xmath46 . for simplicity , we assume a fixed cost , e.g. manpower or surveillance installation cost , of securing each meter for the time being .",
    "this requires solving the following problem @xmath51 which is proved to be an _ np - hard _ problem in the next section .",
    "interestingly , we show that ( [ 98 ] ) can be characterized as a variant steiner tree problem in a graph . the results will be used in the next section to develop graphical algorithms .      in this subsection",

    "then , we establish the equivalence between power network observability and state estimate protection criterion .",
    "the results will be used in the next subsection to formulate an equivalent graphical characterization of the optimal state protection problem in ( [ 98 ] ) .",
    "a power network can be described in an undirected graph , where vertices and edges represent buses and transmission lines , respectively .",

    "in this section , we discuss the possibility of extending the proposed algorithms to some interesting application scenarios .",
    "the topics we consider include : the integration of phasor measurement units ( pmus ) into state estimation , the applicability to ac state estimation model and the extension to achieve incremental state variable protection .",
    "interestingly , we find that our proposed algorithms can fit in all the considered scenarios with minor modifications .",
    "recently , the introduction of more sophisticated measurement components has largely improved the accuracy and reliability of state estimation .",
    "one such device is the phasor measurement unit ( pmu ) .",
    "combined with gps technology , pmus can provide direct real - time voltage phasor measurement , i.e. voltage amplitude and phase angle , with high precision and short measurement periodic time @xcite . in other words , any bus with a pmu installed does not need to estimate its voltage phasor if the device has a credible precision . there have been a number of studies on the pmu deployment to improve power network observability @xcite .",
    "however , although the introduction of pmus can be dated back to the @xmath221s , its deployment had been in a slow pace until the past decade when a series of severe blackout experienced all around the world @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the available pmus alone are still not sufficient to guarantee the observability of entire power network . in practice",
    ", we need to rely on the mixed measurements provided by both pmus and the conventional scada system to derive the state estimates @xcite .",
    "interestingly , our proposed algorithms can be easily extended to protect state estimation when pmus are used .",
    "note that the state variable of a tagged bus can not be compromised by attacks if a secured pmu is installed at the bus .",
    "this is equivalent to installing a secured flow meter between the tagged bus and the reference bus .",
    "if there exists no such power line connecting the two buses , a pseudo transmission line can be added to facilitate the calculation of the mmst problem .",
    "then , the proposed protection algorithms can be directly applied to solve the mmst problem .",
    "the only modification needed is that injection meters can not be mapped to a dashed edge in the steiner tree solution , because they do not measure the dashed edges in real system .",
    "the modification can be easily made in the constraints on @xmath161 in the milp formulation ( [ 27 ] ) by defining @xmath222 if a dashed edge @xmath223 is made up by a pmu .",
    "for the tph , the pruning rules need slight modification due to the change of mapping rule of injection meters in the presence of pmus .",
    "the details are omitted here to avoid the repetition of presentations .",
    "we provide an illustrative example in fig .",
    "@xmath224 , where a graph is extracted from a @xmath209-bus power network .",
    "bus @xmath4 is the reference bus and pmus are available at bus @xmath4 and @xmath13 .",
    "the solid edges are the actual transmission lines in the power network .",
    "the dashed edge connecting bus @xmath4 and @xmath13 is made up by the pmu at bus @xmath13 , where a pseudo - flow meter of random direction is placed on edge @xmath225 .",
    "as discussed above , in any steiner tree solution , the injection meter at bus @xmath13 can not be mapped to the dashed edge @xmath225 made up by the pmu .",
    "since now we have formulated an equivalent problem with only power flows / injections as the measurements , the proposed tree construction algorithms in section iv can be directly applied .",
    "suppose that the state variable of bus @xmath209 is to be protected , a steiner tree can be constructed by edges @xmath226 , which are mapped to the pseudo - flow meter on edge @xmath225 ( from the pmu at bus @xmath13 ) and the flow meter on edge @xmath227 , respectively .",
    "then , bus @xmath209 can be defended if the pmu at bus @xmath13 and the flow meter on @xmath227 are protected .          unlike the linear dc power flow model ,",
    "the measurement functions of ac power flow model consist of non - linear and coupled active and reactive power flow measurements . meanwhile , the voltage amplitudes are also considered as the state variables in ac power flow model . specifically , the active and reactive power flows on a power line connecting bus @xmath163 and @xmath176 are functions are @xmath228\\\\    q_{ij } & = -v_i^2 \\cdot b_{ij } + v_iv_j \\left [ b_{ij } \\cos(\\theta_i-\\theta_j ) - g_{ij } \\sin(\\theta_i-\\theta_j)\\right ] ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath229 is the voltage amplitude at bus @xmath163 , @xmath230 and @xmath231 are the conductance and susceptance of the power line ( neglecting the shunt elements ) .",
    "besides , the injection measurements at a bus are merely the sum of power flows in the incident branches .",
    "the ac state estimation is commonly performed in an iterative manner using the newton s method @xcite",
    ". false - data injection attack to ac state estimation is much harder than to the dc counter part .",
    "on one hand , both the active and reactive flows measurements need to be compromised . on the other hand",
    ", the attacker also needs to know the estimated values of state variables to calculate the attack parameter @xcite .",
    "this basically requires the knowledge of all the real - time measurement readings .    despite the apparent differences , we find that the proposed algorithms can still be applied to protect ac state estimation if the attackers only compromise voltage phase angle variables as in the dc model . in particular , the proposed methods remain both valid and optimal ( for exact algorithms ) in protecting state variables in ac state estimation . from the attackers perspective , given @xmath232",
    "are constant ( assumed untouched by attackers ) , we notice that the power flow measurements in ( [ ac ] ) are only determined by phase angles differences , which is the same as in dc power flow model .",
    "for example , suppose that an attacker wants to perform an undetectable attack to compromise the phase angle variable of bus @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ pmu ] ( we assume the meters measure both active and reactive flows / injections and the pmus are removed ) , by introducing the same error @xmath233 to the phase angle variables of bus @xmath16 to @xmath209 . from ( [ ac ] ) , the attacker does not need to compromise the flow meters on @xmath234 and @xmath227 , and the injection meter at bus @xmath13 .",
    "however , it is necessary for the attacker to compromise the readings of the boundary meters , i.e. the flow meters on edge @xmath235 and @xmath236 , and the injection meter on bus @xmath136 .",
    "the compromised measurements will result in a biased estimate produced by the system operator s ac state estimator when the system is observable , i.e. the ac state estimation converges to a unique solution under any set of consistent measurements . in general",
    ", the attacker needs to find a cut that separates a tagged bus @xmath237 and the reference bus , introducing the same error @xmath233 to the subgraph that contains the bus @xmath237 and zero error to buses in the other subgraph that contains the reference bus .",
    "then , the attacker only needs to compromise the meters , either flow or injection meters , which measure the buses on boundary .",
    "conversely , if a minimum measured steiner tree is constructed by edges mapped to secured meter measurements from the reference to bus @xmath237 , no undetectable attack can be performed .",
    "this is because any attack formulation by cut will require the attacker to compromise at least one secured meter measurement .",
    "therefore , our proposed method for dc state estimation model remains valid and optimal in ac state estimation model .",
    "however , if attackers also compromise voltage amplitude state variables , our methods may still be valid but no longer optimal .",
    "this is because the readings of flow meters are now determined by the absolute values , rather than the difference of voltage amplitudes .",
    "more detailed analysis in ac state estimation protection will be considered as a future working direction .",
    "another interesting extension of the proposed algorithms is to achieve incremental protection .",
    "eventually , the system operator may want to protect all the state variables in the power system",
    ". however , due to the temporary limited budget and lengthy security installation time in a large scale power network , we may only be able to install security devices on a set of meters to protect a subset of state variables first .",
    "later , we can extend the coverage to protect the other state variables given the already protected meters , until all state variables are protected .",
    "in fact , our proposed algorithms can be extended to achieve such incremental protection .",
    "the intuitive idea is to  grow \" a new feasible tree on top of the existing feasible tree to reaches more vertices to be protected .",
    "suppose that a set of state variables @xmath238 has been defended by protecting a set of meters @xmath239 .",
    "a feasible tree @xmath240 can therefore be constructed using the maximum - flow technique introduced in the appendix . by doing so",
    ", we also obtain the mapping between the measurement and edges .",
    "assume that we want to extend the coverage to defend another set of state variables @xmath241 , i.e. @xmath242 , given the protected meters @xmath239 .",
    "notice that the choice of @xmath243 can be made arbitrary by the system operator .",
    "intuitively , we need to find minimum number of edges , as well as the mapped meter measurements , to connect the vertices in @xmath241 to the current feasible tree @xmath240 . for the milp formulation in ( [ 27 ] ) , we can first add to the constraints @xmath158 and @xmath162 for those edges and injection meter in the existing feasible tree @xmath240 .",
    "that is , @xmath158 if edge @xmath223 is included in @xmath240 ; @xmath162 if the injection meter at bus @xmath174 is mapped to the edge @xmath223 .",
    "then , a new minimum measured steiner tree ( mmst ) as well as the new meter set @xmath244 to be protected can be calculated using the optimization in ( [ 27 ] ) .",
    "this can be achieved by a simple replacement of @xmath46 with @xmath241 , i.e. deliver one unit of demand to each vertex in @xmath241 .",
    "similar calculations can be performed to defend @xmath245 , @xmath246 , @xmath247 , until all the state variables are protected . for the tph ,",
    "we merely need to add several new policies to make sure that the mmst generated in the previous iteration to defend the variable set @xmath248 remain intact in the current iteration to defend another variable set @xmath249 .",
    "the detailed pruning policies are omitted here due to the scope of this paper .",
    "notice that the number of meters needed to protect all the state variables equals to the number of state variables , i.e. the size of a basic measurement set as introduced in @xcite , since we always keep a feasible tree whose edge is one - to - one mapped to a secured meter measurement .    before leaving this session ,",
    "we want to emphasize that all the proposed algorithms can be built on top of the existing state estimation application in ems / scada .",
    "this is because the proposed algorithms merely find out a minimum set of meter measurements to be protected without altering the algorithm of state estimation or bdd .",

    "<S> the normal operation of power system relies on accurate state estimation that faithfully reflects the physical aspects of the electrical power grids . </S>",

    "<S> no false data injection attack can be launched to compromise any set of state variables . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the optimal protection problem , which protects the state variables with minimum number of measurements , as a variant steiner tree problem in a graph . based on the graphical characterization , we propose both exact and reduced - complexity approximation algorithms . in particular , we show that the proposed tree - pruning based approximation algorithm significantly reduces computational complexity , while yielding negligible performance degradation compared with the optimal algorithms . </S>",
