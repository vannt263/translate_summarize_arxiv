    "the @xmath0-axis infrared response of the high-@xmath4 cuprate superconductors ( htcs ) is strongly sensitive to doping .",

    "@xcite in contrast , the response of overdoped htcs exhibits a metallic behavior.@xcite these findings , in particular the pseudogap , and the qualitative nature of the changes across the phase diagram , make the @xmath0-axis response one of the most interesting properties of the htcs ( for a review see ref .  ) . in materials with two copper - oxygen planes per unit cell ( the so called bilayer compounds ) , the @xmath0-axis response also reflects the electronic coupling within the pair of closely - spaced planes , that is of high interest for the following reasons : ( _ i _ )  its renormalization with respect to the noninteracting case is an important fingerprint of the electronic correlations of the ground state .",
    "( _ ii _ )  for underdoped htcs , the manifestations of the pseudogap in @xmath5 interfere with those of the coupling .",

    "the character of the coupling has been debated since the early years of the high-@xmath4 research . according to the conventional band theory",
    ", the hopping between the planes should lead to a splitting of the conduction band into two branches : a bonding branch corresponding to states that are symmetric with respect to the mirror plane in the middle of the bilayer unit , and an antibonding branch corresponding to states that are antisymmetric.@xcite for some regions of the brillouin zone ( bz ) , the bonding band is expected to be located below the fermi level and the antibonding band above , which should give rise to the interband transitions.@xcite    the experimental normal state ( ns ) infrared spectra of the bilayer compounds , however , do not contain any structure that could be easily attributed to the transitions . furthermore , the 20th - century photoemission experiments did not reveal the splitting of the conduction band . these findings could be interpreted in terms of strong electronic correlations localizing charged quasiparticles in individual planes , even in the case of the bilayer unit , and inhibiting the band splitting .",
    "the simple band - structure based picture of the ns thus seemed to have failed .",
    "the experimental superconducting ( sc ) state infrared spectra of underdoped bilayer compounds exhibit features that are almost certainly related to the bilayer coupling : a broad absorption peak in the spectra of @xmath6 in the frequency region between @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( labeled as @xmath9 in the following ) and related anomalies of some infrared active phonons.@xcite these features , however , also appear to be consistent with the absence of the conduction - band splitting and the localization of charged quasiparticles : it was shown that they can be well understood and in some cases even fitted @xcite using the phenomenological model , where the stack of the copper - oxygen planes is represented by a superlattice of inter- and intra - bilayer josephson junctions ( the so called josephson superlattice model , jsm).@xcite the mode @xmath9 has been attributed to the transverse plasma mode of the model . a microscopic justification of the model in terms of quasiparticle green s functions has been provided by shah and millis @xcite .    in the beginning of the 21st century , the situation changed .",
    "in particular , several groups have reported observations of two separate conduction bands in photoemission spectra . @xcite the jsm is obviously not consistent with this observation .",

    "@xcite this appears to be unlikely .",
    "the presence of @xmath13 can not be accounted for in terms of the jsm .",
    "these facts thus call for a replacement of the simple phenomenological jsm with a more sophisticated theory involving the bilayer - split bands . here",
    "we present such a theory and provide a fully microscopic interpretation of the superconductivity - induced modes @xmath9 and @xmath13 .",

    "i.e. _ , the in - plane quasiparticle velocity , and @xmath217 . both @xmath317 and @xmath5 exhibit a maximum around @xmath191 and both decrease with increasing energy above this maximum .",

    "the sm theory provides a peak inside the gap , corresponding to a bilayer plasmon , similar to the transverse josephson plasmon of the phenomenological model.@xcite the @xmath257 peak of our theory is located at a slightly higher energy and its interpretation is different .",
    "what it has in common with the transverse josephson plasmon is that both are associated with oscillations of the relative phase of the two closely - spaced planes . for high values of @xmath217 ,",
    "our approach yields the pair - breaking peak @xmath267 absent at the sm level . at high energies ( above @xmath237 ) ,",
    "the results of the two approaches are similar .",
    "interestingly , the ns spectra corresponding to @xmath303 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmacover](a ) do not display any clear signature of the bilayer splitting , consistent with experimental data . the contribution of the bonding - antibonding transitions is hidden in the mid - infrared region .",
    "this is because the renormalization of the quasiparticles leads to a very broad absorption band [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : sf1](a ) ] shifted towards the mid - infrared both by the the vertex corrections and by the coulomb effects [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : sf1](b ) and ( e ) ] .",
    "experiments reveal an increase of the optical spectral weight in the far - infrared below @xmath4 , with a possible interpretation in terms of a decrease of the @xmath0-axis kinetic energy associated with the superconducting transition.@xcite the picture resulting from our calculations , restricted to the case of small values of @xmath218 and @xmath254 , is the following : below @xmath4 , the peak @xmath257 forms , gaining spectral weight from a broad interval of energies , and the spectral weight at low energies increases .",
    "the total spectral weight , proportional to the negatively taken effective kinetic energy @xmath253 , decreases , provided that @xmath52 ( below @xmath4)= @xmath52 ( above @xmath4 ) .",
    "however , changes of @xmath52 upon entering the superconducting state , in particular the formation of the resonance mode , can lead to a slight increase of the total spectral weight and the corresponding decrease of @xmath253 , the mechanism being connected to that outlined in ref .  .",
    "the issue is fairly complex and will be addressed in a separate publication .",
    "we have constructed a realistic microscopic model of the @xmath0-axis infrared response of bilayer cuprate superconductors allowing us to interpret the superconductivity - induced modes occurring in the experimental data .    for the simpler case of insulating spacing layers ,",
    "the local conductivity of the intrabilayer region does not possess a condensate contribution in the superconducting state [ @xmath319 in @xmath320 as assumed within the phenomenological josephson superlattice model .",
    "instead , it displays a collective mode at a finite frequency that is proportional to the interplane hopping amplitude @xmath217 .",
    "this has been shown to be a consequence of the gauge invariance .",
    "the nature of the mode is similar to that of the bogolyubov - anderson mode that participates in the longitudinal response of a homogeneous superconductor .",
    "it is associated with charge oscillations between the planes and , for small values of @xmath217 , also with oscillations of the relative phase of the two planes .",
    "this physical picture is fairly similar to that of the transverse plasmon of the josephson superlattice model . in the total @xmath0-axis conductivity the mode",
    "is shifted towards higher energies by the interplane coulomb interaction .",
    "a nonzero amplitude of the hopping through the spacing layer implies a finite conductivity of this layer .",
    "this local conductivity exhibits a peak at a frequency slightly higher than @xmath321 , that can be interpreted as a pair breaking peak .",
    "the simple picture is such that two bogolyubov quasiparticles are involved : one from the bonding band and the other from the antibonding .",
    "the reason , why the peak appears in the inter - bilayer conductivity and not in the intra - bilayer one , is the following .",
    "excited states behind the former ( latter ) conductivity involve quasiparticles from different bilayers ( from the same bilayer ) . only the latter are thus strongly modified by including the final - state interactions , that are restricted to individual bilayers .",
    "the peak permeates into the total @xmath0-axis conductivity .",
    "a series of arguments has been presented assigning the collective mode to the low energy superconductivity - induced mode of the experimental data ( interpreted previously in terms of the josephson superlattice model ) and the pair - breaking maximum to the superconductivity - induced peak centered around @xmath3 .",
    "the arguments concern the doping dependence of the frequencies and the spectral weights of the peaks and the impact of various substitutions .",
    "a crucial assumption , connecting the theory and the experiment , is that the effective @xmath217 decreases with decreasing doping",
    ". the trends of the underdoped regime , in particular , the appearance of the collective mode below @xmath4 , the increase of its frequency with increasing doping and its disappearance below optimum doping can all be reasonably reproduced and understood using this assumption . admittedly , the values of @xmath217 of a few tens of mev needed to fit the data are smaller than those deduced from photoemission experiments .",
    "the main features of the data of optimally doped y-123 can be reasonably reproduced with @xmath218 of @xmath322 , which corresponds to the maximum distance between the renormalized bands of ca @xmath190 .",
