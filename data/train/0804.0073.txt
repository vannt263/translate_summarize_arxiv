    "the idea that the space - time might be more than four dimensions is being considered widely from particle physics to cosmology . obviously string theory provided a strong motivation for considering higher dimensions .",
    "recently the development of string theory have led us to diverse cosmological scenarios , for example , d - brane inflation , moduli inflation , cyclic and ekpyrotic scenarios , mirage cosmology , and string or brane gas cosmology .",
    "one of the primary goals of string cosmology is to achieve string compactification which can produce inflation successfully .",
    "early in the study of cosmology based on string theory , it was realized that the presence of a gas of strings plays an important role in the evolution of the universe in refs .",
    "they suggested a mechanism to generate dynamically the spatial dimensionality of spacetime and to explain the problem of initial singularity . with the symmetry of string theory , called t - duality , spacetime has the topology of a nine - dimensional torus , and its dynamics is driven by a gas of fundamental strings . in string theory",
    "the winding modes can annihilate the anti - winding modes if they meet .",
    "once the windings are removed from some dimensions , these dimensions can expand .",
    "since strings have ( 1 + 1)-dimensional world volumes , they can intersect efficiently in 2(1 + 1 ) spacetime dimensions or less .",
    "thus , three spatial dimensions can become large with a gas of strings .",
    "a gas of fundamental strings was generalized to a gas of various branes to accommodate the development of d - branes in string theory @xcite .",
    "many studies on this issue of string cosmology with string or brane gas was followed ( see @xcite and references therein for comprehensive reviews ) .",
    "the key point of replacing string gas with brane gas is that a hierarchy of scales can be achieved between wrapped and unwrapped dimensions .",
    "it has been checked whether the unwrapped configuration of branes can generate the inflation successfully @xcite .",
    "also it is known that string or brane gases of purely winding modes are not enough to stabilize the extra dimensions .",
    "for example , in eleven dimensional supergravity , easter _",
    "@xcite have succeeded in producing anisotropic expansion by selecting a certain wrapping matrix .",
    "however the radions ( scales of the extra dimensions ) were not stabilized .",
    "stabilization of the radion has been the focus of research in string or brane gas cosmology @xcite .",
    "one way to obtain the stabilization of the extra dimensions is to introduce bulk fields @xcite . in the previous work of the author@xcite",
    ", it is shown that the extra dimensions can be stabilized by including a bulk ramond - ramond ( rr ) flux in the brane gas formalism .",
    "for the specific configuration of brane gas and rr flux where effectively six - dimensional brane gas is wrapping the extra dimensions and 4-form rr flux is in the unwrapped dimensions , the flux can cause a logarithmic bounce to the effective potential as the volume of the extra dimensions shrinks .    considering the quantum aspect of the string or brane gas",
    ", there will be a large amount of energy when winding modes and anti - winding modes of branes annihilate with each other .",
    "for example , string winding modes and anti - winding modes can annihilate into unwound closed string loops which can be treated as supergravity particles or radiation .",
    "thus it will be interesting to see how the simplified stabilization mechanism by brane gas and flux can be modified if we include supergravity particles .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the previous study by including supergravity particles .",
    "we consider the ten - dimensional supergravity after the dilaton is stabilized .",
    "we start from the point that winding modes are annihilated in three spatial dimensions causing them free to expand while the brane gas remains in the extra six dimensions by the mechanism of brandenberger and vafa @xcite . with a gas of branes",
    "only , the extra dimensions will shrink to zero size and our assumptions of the brane gas cosmology is not valid anymore . to prevent this collapse we consider the rr flux in the transverse dimensions .",
    "thus the bulk effective action consists of graviton and gauge fields representing the four - form rr flux .",
    "if we consider only the bosonic sector , the effective action can be written as @xcite s = d^d+1x ( r - f_4 ^ 2 ) , [ effact ] where @xmath0 is the scalar curvature , @xmath1 is the field strength of the bulk gauge field , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is the ten - dimensional gravitational constant @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the @xmath6-dimensional unification scale .",
    "the gravitational equations of motion are given by g^mn = - ^2 ( t_g^mn + t_m^mn ) , [ einsteineq ] _",

    "also we have the bianchi identity since @xmath9 is an exact form _ [ i f_jklm ] = 0 .",
    "[ bianchi ]    we assume that background fields and matter sources are homogeneous within the dimensions where they exist",
    ". then we can treat them as functions of time only . considering the spatial section to be a @xmath10-dimensional torus @xmath11 ,",

    "we investigated how the existence of supergravity particles affects the asymmetric evolution of the universe by reducing the einstein equations to the motions of a particle in one - dimensional effective potential .",
    "the shape of the potential for the three dimensional subvolume is barrier - type so that it can expand indefinitely .",
    "however the shape of the potential for the extra dimensional subvolume can be well - type so that it can oscillate between two turning points or be fixed at the minimum of the potential .    in most approaches to the stabilization in string cosmology ,",
    "it is crucial that the dilaton runs to a weak coupling .",
    "the scale factor in the einstein frame is a linear combination of string frame dilaton and scale factors .",

    "they identified a stable fixed point corresponding to the dilaton sitting at the minimum of the potential and the radion taking on the value at which the enhanced symmetry states are massless .",
    "the stability of this fixed point was analyzed by studying the linearized equations of motion around the fixed point .",
    "the solution shows a damped oscillatory behavior confirming the compatibility of two types of moduli stabilization . despite the promising result",
    ", we have to be very careful when we stabilize both dilaton and radion simultaneously .",
    "cremonini and watson @xcite have discussed the stabilization of moduli in eleven dimensional supergravity .",
    "they found that the production rate of the bps bound states could be significant for a modified brane spectrum with enhanced symmetry .",
    "these states can lead to a stabilization by an attractor mechanism .",
    "however , the stabilization drives the evolution to a region where a perturbative description of the string dynamics fails .",
    "that is , the supergravity approximation is not valid in this region .",
    "it is important not to forget the string theory origin of the low - energy effective action .    realizing the transitions between the different thermodynamic phases of string gas is important in string cosmology . in @xcite , it is pointed out that the dilaton field may obstruct the transition from the hagedorn phase of hot and dense string gas to expanding frw phase of dilute string gas .",
    "they categorized the possible branches of the solutions according the sign of the dimensionally reduced effective dilaton and noticed that the branch changing is impossible as long as the energy density of the universe is not negative . finding the appropriate energy sources which enable the phase changing seems another challenge in string / brane gas cosmology .",
