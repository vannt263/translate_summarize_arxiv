    "the exosphere is the upper layer of any planetary atmosphere : it is a quasi - collisionless medium where the particle trajectories are more dominated by gravity than by collisions . above the exobase , the lower limit of the exosphere ,",
    "the knudsen number @xcite becomes large , collisions become scarce , the distribution function can not be considered as maxwellian anymore and , gradually , the trajectories of particles are essentially determined by the gravitation and radiation pressure by the sun .",
    "the trajectories of particles , subject to the gravitational force , are completely solved with the equations of motion , but it is not the case with the radiation pressure @xcite .    in the absence of radiation pressure , we can distinguish three types of trajectories for the exospheric particles :    * the escaping particles come from the exobase and have a positive mechanical energy : they can escape from the gravitational influence of the planet with a velocity larger than the escape velocity .",
    "these particles are responsible for the jeans escape @xcite .",
    "they can also be defined as crossing only once the exobase , * the ballistic particles also come from the exobase but have a negative mechanical energy , they are gravitationally bound to the planet .",
    "they reach a maximum altitude and fall down on the exobase if they do not undergo collisions .",
    "they cross the exobase twice , * the satellite particles never cross the exobase .",
    "they also have a negative mechanical energy but their periapsis is above the exobase : they orbit along an entire ellipse around the planet without crossing the exobase .",
    "the satellite particles result in their major part from ballistic particles undergoing few collisions mainly near the exobase ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , they do not exist in a collisionless model of the exosphere .",
    "the radiation pressure disturbs the conics ( ellipses or hyperbolas ) described by the particles under the influence of gravity .",
    "the resonant scattering of solar photons leads to a total momentum transfer from the photon to the atom or molecule @xcite . in the non - relativistic case , assuming an isotropic reemission of the solar photon , this one is absorbed in the sun direction and scattered with the same probability in all directions . for a sufficient flux of photons in the absorption wavelength range",
    ", the reemission in average does not induce any momentum transfer from the atom / molecule to the photon .",
    "the momentum variation , each second , between before and after the scattering imparts a force , the radiation pressure .",
    "@xcite proposed to analyze its effect on the structure of planetary exospheres . in particular",
    ", they highlighted analytically the  tail \" phenomenon at earth : the density for atomic hydrogen , which is sensitive to the lyman-@xmath0 photons , is higher in the nightside direction than in the dayside direction in the earth corona .",
    "nevertheless , their work was limited only to the sun - planet axis , with a null component assumed for the angular momentum around the sun - planet axis .",
    "we thus generalize here their work to a full 3d calculation , in order to investigate the influence of the radiation pressure on the trajectories ( this paper ) , as well as the density profiles and escape flux ( following works ) .",
    "this problem is similar to the so - called stark effect @xcite : the effect of a constant electric field on the atomic hydrogen s electron .",
    "its study can be transposed to celestial mechanics in order to describe the orbits of artificial and natural satellites in the perturbed ( e.g. by the radiation pressure force ) two - body problem .",
    "a recent description of the stark effect solutions was already given by @xcite .",
    "however , they give the analytical solutions of all trajectories only in the 2d case ( and for bounded trajectories in the 3d case ) , and their formulas have some issues as will be discussed later .",
    "another analytical study proposed by @xcite uses the weierstrassian formulations to solve the motions for bounded and unbounded trajectories and to find periodic motions .",
    "also , the motion can be approached numerically by developing the equations of motion in taylor series but this leads to some issues for high eccentricities @xcite",
    ". @xcite compared recently these methods and their computing efficiencies .    in this paper , based on the same formalism as @xcite",
    ", we provide for the first time the complete exact 3d solutions of the stark effect ( and its celestial mechanics analogue ) for any initial condition and for both bounded and unbounded trajectories .",
    "the first section describes the formalism used , before the sections [ model]/[section3]/[time ] provide the equations of motion and time .",
    "we then discuss about circular orbits in section [ circular ] , while a comparison with previous works is given in section 6 , before we conclude in section [ summary ] .",
    "in this work , we decide to study the effect of the radiation pressure on atomic hydrogen in particular . nevertheless , this formalism can be applied to any species subject to this force or to the interplanetary dust .",
    "we model the radiation pressure by a constant acceleration @xmath1 coming from the sun . according to @xcite , this acceleration depends on the line center solar lyman-@xmath0 flux @xmath2 , in @xmath3 photons.@xmath4.s@xmath5.@xmath5 : @xmath6    in spherical coordinates",
    ", the hamiltonian of one hydrogen atom can be written : @xmath7 with @xmath8 the distance from the planet , @xmath9 the solar angle , @xmath10 the angle with respect to the ecliptic plane , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 the conjugate momenta .",
    "@xmath14 represents the gravitational potential and @xmath15 the potential energy from the radiation pressure acceleration @xmath1 .",
    "an example of trajectory of a @xmath16 atom subject to the radiation pressure is given in the figure [ trajectoire ] .",
    "this problem is similar to the classical stark effect @xcite : a constant electric field ( here the radiation pressure ) is applied to an electron ( here an hydrogen atom ) attached to a proton ( here the planet ) .",
    "both systems are equivalent because the force applied by the proton ( the planet ) to the electron ( the hydrogen atom ) , i.e. the electrostatic force , varies in @xmath17 as the gravitational force from the planet on the hydrogen atom .",
    "thus , we adopt the same formalism as @xcite and use the parabolic coordinates .",
    "we use the transformation : @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 always positive .",
    "consequently , the hamiltonian becomes : @xmath21 independent from @xmath22 and @xmath10 .    according to hamiltonian canonical relations",
    ", we have : @xmath23      in this new system of coordinates , we study this hamiltonian .",
    "first , @xmath24 is independent from @xmath22 explicitly .",
    "@xmath24 is a conserved quantity along the time and corresponds to the mechanical energy @xmath25 of the system .",
    "moreover , as @xmath24 is independent from @xmath10 , according to canonical relations : @xmath26    thus , @xmath27 is another constant of the motion .",
    "once @xmath25 and @xmath13 defined , the equation [ hamiltonuw ] can be rewritten : @xmath28    the left hand side is a function dependent only on @xmath19 and @xmath29 , the right hand side depends only on @xmath20 and @xmath30",
    ". as both functions are equal and independent , they are equal to a constant @xmath31 , a separation constant : @xmath32    the motion possesses three constants : @xmath25 , @xmath31 and @xmath13 .",
    "the equation [ a ] allows to express @xmath29 ( respectively @xmath30 ) as a functions of @xmath25 , @xmath31 , @xmath13 and @xmath19 ( respectively @xmath20 ) :    @xmath33    with @xmath34      we have already introduced the hamiltonian @xmath24 of the system .",
    "we can extend the approach according to hamilton - jacobi equations : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the hamilton s principal function or action .",

    "@xmath20 ) , assuming @xmath25 , @xmath31 and @xmath13 values already fixed by initial conditions .",

    "these potentials play key roles for the motion because they constrained the motion in @xmath19 and @xmath20 directions independently . for the motion of the particle , we must respect two conditions : @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "these conditions are analogous to : @xmath54     ( corresponding to @xmath55 , blue line ) and @xmath56 ( corresponding to @xmath57 , red line ) for a set of @xmath25 , @xmath31 and @xmath27 values .",

    "similarly , for the @xmath20-motion , there are two cases : the motion is constrained between one paraboloid ( @xmath84 ) and the infinity or between two paraboloids ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) .",

    "as shown in the figure [ restriction2 ] ( right panel ) , the particle seems to explore all the area when its motion is restricted by four paraboloids .",
    "this is simply an observation .",
    "how can we prove that without any information on the exact motion of the particle ? according to the poincar recurrence theorem , if the dynamical trajectory of the autonomous system evolves in a finite volume of the phase space , then in any domain , as small as it could be , there are at least two points which belong to the same trajectory . here , the motion is constrained in space with the four paraboloids but also in velocity because @xmath29 and @xmath30 are finite values and @xmath27 is constant .",
    "all the positions in this part of the phase space can belong to the same trajectory .",
    "this is also linked to the kam theory : here , the perturbation ( the radiation pressure ) affects the periodic motion ( the ellipse , bounded trajectories ) but it can remain quasi - periodic . as we will see , the global motion is not periodic but @xmath19 and @xmath20 motions possess their own period according to another parameter .",
    "the global motion can be periodic only if all periods are commensurable .",
    "this is an important result because if the particle belongs to an area crossing the exobase and if this area is closed in the phase space , along a finite time , the particle will again cross the exobase .",
    "we can now define the ballistic and satellite particles as follows : both populations have no elliptic trajectories due to the radiation pressure , but they evolve in a closed domain . depending on their constants of the motion , we can easily determine whether they cross ( i.e. the domain crosses ) the exobase or not , corresponding to ballistic and satellite particles respectively . escaping particles",
    "are in the case where the initial value of @xmath20 is higher than the highest real root of @xmath59 and their available area is opened to the infinity .",
    "thus , the theorem can not be applied here .",
    "even if the restriction area crosses the exobase , the particle may come from infinity , come close to the exobase and go away without crossing the exobase .",
    "we need , in order to identify escaping particles ( that cross the exobase and go to the infinity ) , to track along the time the particle to know if these particles come from the exobase or not .",
    "thus , it is necessary to solve their trajectory along the time .      for convenience , as usual in fluid mechanics",
    ", we define characteristic quantities .",
    "we decide to write all equations with dimensionless parameters .",
    "first , for distance , we define : @xmath88 this characteristic value was introduced by @xcite and defines the limit distance where the radiation pressure overwhelms the gravitation of the planet . then",
    ", we rewrite : @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the dimensionless quantities associated to @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the energy @xmath25 is adimensionned with the use of the characteristic energy @xmath92 . for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , we express them in units of @xmath93 , whereas @xmath27 is expressed in units of @xmath94 .",

    "this last work dealt with the dynamical trajectories of artificial satellites but it can be applied to exospheric species subject to the radiation pressure .",
    "we propose here corrections as well as a better way to give  simple \" expressions for dynamical trajectories .",
    "we also provide expressions for unbounded trajectories that are missing in the literature . in the same way",

    ", we have different restrictions on the motion and thus , we must distinguish the cases , that will correspond to the different types of possible trajectories .",
    "we may thus define the ballistic / satellite / escaping populations based on the roots of the @xmath58 and @xmath59 polynoms .",
    "the trajectories are not elliptic or hyperbolic at all but one can keep their basic definitions : crossing twice the exobase for ballistic particles , orbiting but not crossing the exobase for satellite particles , coming from the exobase and escaping to the infinity for escaping particles .",
    "the number of real roots is a key parameter for the analytical resolution of the trajectories .",
