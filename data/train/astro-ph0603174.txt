    "supernova explosions are thought to play a fundamental role in the evolution of galaxies . through the ejection of metals and energy into the interstellar medium , they significantly affect the gas collapse , the star formation activity and the chemical patterns . as a consequence , sn feedback would be able to set a self - regulated mechanism for the star formation activity and the enrichment of the universe .",
    "moreover , sn driven outflows are believed to be responsible for the presence of metals detected in the intergalactic medium ( e.g. tytler et al . 1995 ; songaila & cowie 1996 ) .    in the context of numerical simulations ,",
    "the treatment of sn feedback has found severe complications .",
    "several works have developed models of different complexity to treat sn feedback in smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ; gingold & monaghan 1977 ; lucy 1977 ) codes ( e.g. katz & gunn 1991 ; navarro & white 1993 ; metzler & evrard 1994 ; marri & white 2003 ; springel & hernquist 2003 ) , finding different levels of success .",
    "in this study , we analise simulations of isolated disc galaxies of different virial masses from idealized initial conditions .",
    "the initial conditions correspond to spherical distributions of superposed gaseous and dark matter particles , perturbed to give rise to a density profile of the form @xmath0 .",
    "the spheres are initially in solid body rotation with a spin parameter of @xmath1 .",
    "we have used an initial number of @xmath2 both gaseous and dark matter particles for all masses .",
    "the simulations were performed with the extended version of the tree - pm sph code gadget-2 ( springel & hernquist 2002 ) which includes a treatment of chemical enrichment and energy feedback by supernova ( scannapieco et al .",
    "2005a , b , c ) .",
    "the model is tight to a multiphase scheme which allows a better description of diffuse gas in the context of the sph technique .",
    "the interested reader is referred to scannapieco et al .",
    "2005a , b for details on the numerical scheme .",
    "all experiments presented in this study include chemical enrichment and metal - dependent cooling , and they all have been run in the context of the multiphase treatment for the gas component .",
    "it is relevant to this study to mention that the energy feedback model has only one free input parameter . within the model , we define for each star particle with associated sn explosions two gaseous phases in the following manner : a _ cold _ phase defined as the gas with @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 k , @xmath6 g @xmath7 ) and a _ hot _ phase formed by the remaining gas .",
    "the energy released in the explosions , as well as the metal content , are distributed into the cold and hot phases : the cold phase receives a fraction @xmath8 while the hot phase gets the remaining @xmath9 .",
    "hence , the parameter @xmath8 ( or @xmath10 equivalently ) is the only free parameter to assume .",
    "note that the value of @xmath8 is related to the power of the feedback .",
    "however , we note that the effects of varying its value are not completely linear , owing to the non trivial interplay among energy release , heating and cooling ( see scannapieco et al",
    ". 2005b ) .",
    "we analise here results for isolated disc galaxy simulations , in the virial mass range @xmath11 @xmath12 m@xmath13 . in fig .  [ sfr ]",
    "we show the evolution of the star formation rate for tests of @xmath14 @xmath12 m@xmath13 ( upper panel ) , @xmath15 @xmath12 m@xmath13 ( middle panel ) and @xmath16 @xmath12 m@xmath13 systems ( lower panel ) . we have plotted the curves for experiments performed without including energy feedback ( solid lines ) and including feedback with an input parameter of @xmath17 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "these trends indicate that the inclusion of the model of sn energy feedback succeeds in regulating the star formation activity in galaxies .",
    "this is the result of the effects of the injection of energy into the interstellar gas : when sne explosions take place , the gas is efficiently heated up and accelerated outwards . as a result , the cold gas density from which stars are formed decreases and the star formation rate is reduced .",
    "note also that lower mass systems are more strongly affected , as expected since their potential wells are less efficient in retaining baryons ( larson 1974 ) .    as it was mentioned before , sn feedback is responsible of heating up the gas in star forming regions and , consequently , of generating important outflows of material .",
    "since these outflows originate in the center of the systems where the gas is highly enriched with metals , they can transport an important fraction of the chemical elements into the haloes and even beyond .",
    "this could in principle explain the observed presence of metals in the intergalactic medium . as an example",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ metallicity_map ] the edge - on projected gas metallicity distribution for our test of @xmath14 @xmath12 m@xmath13 virial mass system just after the starburst . from this figure",
    "we can see that our model is able to enrich the regions outside the centre of galaxies .",
    "also note that the generated outflows are mostly perpendicular to the disc plane .",
    "we have presented results of the effects of sn feedback on the evolution of isolated disc galaxies of different mass , by using an extended version of the code gadget-2 which includes a treatment of chemical and energy feedback by supernova .",
    "we have shown that the model succeeds in generating a self - regulated star formation process , as a consequence of the triggering of strong outflows of material .",
    "we found that the impact of sn feedback on galaxy formation depends on virial mass .",
    "smaller systems are more strongly affected since they have shallower potential wells and hence are less efficient in retaining baryons . in particular , we found that the star formation rates of small systems such as dwarf galaxies can show a series of starbursts , in consistency with recent observational findings ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 ; tolstoy et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "in our model , galactic outflows transport an important fraction of the metal content from the centre to the outskirts of galaxies .",
    "this is of crucial importance since it is observed that the intergalactic medium is contaminated with heavy metals .",
    "sn driven outflows such as those generated by our model constitute a natural explanation for this observational result .",
