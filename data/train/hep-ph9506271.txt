    "the deficit of solar neutrinos can be explained by neutrino oscillations with a ( mass)@xmath0 difference @xmath1 together with the enhancement of these oscillations as the neutrinos pass through the sun by the msw effect@xcite .",
    "there are also hints of possible neutrino oscillations with @xmath2 in atmospheric neutrino experiments@xcite .",
    "approximately twenty - five years ago an interesting suggestion was made for probing even lower values of @xmath3 using the @xmath4 annual variation of the earth ",
    "sun distance@xcite . in this case , rather than simply observing a net average decrease in the electron neutrino intensity by an amount @xmath5 one could observe the actual oscillations of the electron neutrino flux .",
    "the idea is to use the @xmath6 s from @xmath7 capture on be ^7be+e^-^7li+_e [ eq:1 ] which results in a neutrino energy @xmath8 with a small energy spread .",
    "thus if the neutrino oscillation length l_osc = [ eq:2 ] is within one or two orders of magnitude of the variation @xmath9 of the earth ",
    "sun distance then , depending on the value of @xmath10 , it may be possible to see the neutrino oscillations provided @xmath3 is in the range @xmath11 .",
    "one of the most essential ingredients in making the above scenario work is that the spread in energy @xmath12 of the neutrino `` beam '' is not too wide .",
    "this is especially true in this case since @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath12 is too large then by the time the neutrinos arrive at the earth the oscillation patterns for neutrinos of different energies get sufficiently out of phase to wipe out any potentially observable oscillations .",
    "this results simply in a decrease of the total @xmath6 intensity by an amount @xmath5 .",
    "a coherence length @xmath14 is usually defined as the distance at which a neutrino of energy @xmath15 has undergone one oscillation more than a neutrino of energy @xmath16 .",
    "this coherence length is given by l_max= = l_osc ( ) [ eq:3 ] and the total number of complete oscillations will be n_max= [ eq:4a ] thus when @xmath17 is larger than about @xmath18 we can no longer observe the oscillations and a narrow energy range @xmath12 is therefore required .",
    "the argument above assumed that the energy spread of the neutrino beam is incoherent in origin in the sense that it is due to slightly different energies of various neutrinos .",
    "the main origin of this energy spread @xmath12 is that the continuum electrons which are captured by the @xmath19 have an energy spread @xmath20 which translates into a similar spread @xmath21 of the emerging neutrino energies .",
    "another slightly smaller contribution to @xmath22 originates from the different doppler shifts due to thermal nuclear velocities ( relative to the line of sight )  the analog of the well known doppler broadening in atomic spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "`` coherent broadening ''  namely the quantum mechanical spread @xmath23 of a * single * neutrino can also lead to the loss of the oscillation pattern@xcite .",
    "the well known natural line width in atomic spectroscopy : e ~~ ( _ decay)^-1 [ eq:5 ] is an example of coherent broadening .",
    "the finite lifetime @xmath24 of the level interrupts the classical emission of the wave  train and limits the size of the wave packet @xmath25 to : x = c_decay [ eq:4 ] with the momentum @xmath26 and the configuration space @xmath27 widths being inversely related to each other via a fourier transform of a lorentzian to an exponential .",
    "another example of coherent broadening is the collisional broadening ( also known as the `` pressure broadening '' ) of the neutrino line .",
    "it stems from the interruption of coherent emission by collisions of the emitting atoms .",
    "the corresponding wave packet size is given by an analog of eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) but with @xmath24 replaced by @xmath28  the effective time interval between `` relevant collisions '' .",
    "this ( nuclear ) collisional broadening effect has been extensively studied as the major contributor to the loss of coherence in neutrino oscillation .",
    "there have been various estimates of the strength of the effect leading to estimates of the size of @xmath29@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite .",
    "a third contribution to the coherent broadening which we believe is likely to contribute even more to the energy spread @xmath23 of the neutrino wave packet is the small size of the wave packets of the captured electrons . since the k electron ionization energy in berillium @xmath30 is small in comparison with the thermal @xmath31 energy ,",
    "the capture in reaction ( [ eq:1 ] ) is primarily that of continuum electrons .",
    "an electron wave packet of size @xmath32 will traverse the ( point like ) nucleus in a time t = [ eq:7 ] where @xmath33 is the velocity of the electron . because the weak interaction underlying the capture process ( [ eq:1 ] ) is local , the time available for the @xmath6 emission is @xmath34 and the size of the outgoing @xmath6 wave packet emitted with velocity @xmath35 ( @xmath36 in our units ) will be _",

    "the electrons suffer many random collisions in the hot core which tend to localize the wave function and reduce the wave packet size .",

    "_ = ~610 ^ -8 cm [ eq:11 ] this @xmath38 is * smaller * ( and the corresponding incoherent broadening is * larger * ) than all previous estimates .",
    "the three mechanisms described above all lead to the conclusion that neutrinos are emitted in the sun as wave packets with a rather small size @xmath38 corresponding to `` coherent broadening '' of the neutrino line by an amount @xmath39 .",
    "this coherent broadening also leads to the loss of the oscillation pattern@xcite after a coherence length @xmath40 which is precisely equal to the coherence length @xmath14 derived in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) .",
    "this result can be derived technically by decomposing the wave packet into plane waves of energy @xmath15 with a probability distribution p(e)=(e)^2 [ eq:12 ] and repeating the discussion leading to eqs .",

    "this leads to identical conclusions but with @xmath12 replaced by the energy spread @xmath23 given by : ( e)^2=de  p(e)(e^2-|e^2 )    there is , however , a simple intuitive explanation for how the oscillations are lost in terms of the wave packet of the neutrino in configuration space@xcite . consider an electron neutrino wave packet which is emitted at @xmath41 from the solar core . at @xmath41",

    "the two wave packets do not overlap at all and all oscillations are lost .",
    "thus the coherence distance @xmath40 which is the maximum distance over which we see oscillations is given by l_coh = n_maxl_osc =( ) l_osc [ eq:18 ] which is precisely the result of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:4a ] ) for the case of incoherent energy broadening .",
    "indeed once @xmath52 is greater than the size @xmath38 of the wave packet the @xmath46 and the @xmath47 will have completely separated spatially .",
    "we would thus expect that they will not interfere when interacting locally with an electron or nucleus in a detector .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to study whether the two effects discussed above namely the incoherent versus the coherent broadening can be distinguished .",
    "they are clearly distinct physical phenomena which can be controlled ( at least in principle ) at the * source*. in an atomic physics analog the doppler broadening can be controlled relative to the natural line width by adjusting the temperature of the system or by confining the atoms to a narrow channel transverse to the line of sight@xcite .",
    "the more interesting question is : can we distinguish these effects at the detector ? in this paper",
    "we shall show that in all physically interesting situations the answer is `` no '' .",
    "we shall discuss some simple cases in which this answer is clear and then we shall prove some general theorems which will show that under a wide variety of physically attainable situations these two effects can not be distinguished .",
    "our goal in this section is to see whether one can distinguish an incoherent ensemble of plane waves with a mean energy @xmath15 and an energy spread @xmath12 from an ensemble of wave packets each with the same mean energy @xmath15 and the same energy width @xmath53 . before proceeding",
    "we should make one point clear . even in the `` incoherent '' case in which we have an ensemble of plane",
    "waves these waves certainly do not have an infinite extent in the @xmath45 direction ( the direction of motion ) .",
    "in fact even if we took each `` plane wave '' ( with an energy in the mev range ) to have an energy uncertainty of the order of @xmath54 ( which is certainly a great underestimate for the solar neutrino case ) the corresponding wave packet would still be only of the order of a cm in size ! !",
    "thus when discussing `` plane waves '' we are in fact referring to wave packets which are much larger than those discussed in the case of coherent broadening but much smaller than any macroscopic scales in the problem .      our aim will be to show that the two broadening effects discussed above can not be distinguished .",
    "we begin with a concrete suggestion for distinguishing these effects and we then show what goes wrong with this suggestion .    let us suppose that we were able to measure the energy of a neutrino with a precision @xmath55 which is much better than @xmath53 .",
    "we then expect that for an incoherent beam of neutrinos with energies in a range @xmath12 about @xmath15 we could recover the oscillations by measuring the neutrino energy to the precision @xmath56 . by plotting the observed neutrino count as a function of r^=r we should see oscillations up to a new distance l_=(e/)l_osc > l_max [ eq:18a ] with no loss of statistics .",
    "note that @xmath12 is replaced by @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) .",
    "if , on the other hand , we began with a wave packet with energy spread @xmath23 then , at a distance larger than @xmath40 ( eq . ( [ eq:18 ] ) ) , the wave packet of the @xmath46 and the @xmath47 are completely separated and one might naively expect that there will be no oscillations even if the energy could be measured more accurately .",
    "this argument turns out to be wrong and we can understand what goes wrong in a very intuitive way .",
    "if we choose to measure the energy very accurately ( to an accuracy @xmath55 ) we require a time @xmath57 to make this measurement .",
    "if , during this time @xmath48 , the second wave packet arrives at the detector then we will once more see the oscillations .",
    "the condition for recovering the oscillations is therefore t ~1/ > r ~ r [ eq:19 ] where @xmath52 is the distance between the wave packets and @xmath58 is the distance from the source ( eq .",
    "( [ eq:15 ] ) ) .",
    "the oscillations thus persist up to a new distance @xmath59 which is the value of @xmath58 for which eq .",
    "( [ eq:19 ] ) breaks down . l_^=(e/)l_osc",
    "[ eq:20 ] which is precisely the same as the result ( [ eq:18a ] ) obtained for the incoherent neutrino beam .",
    "this behavior of the coherent beam is analogous to what occurs for a high q oscillator hit by two successive pulses .",
    "the first pulse ( in our case the @xmath46 beam ) comes along and sets the oscillator in motion .",
    "it then continues to oscillate for a time @xmath57 during which time the second pulse ( in our case the @xmath47 beam ) arrives and causes the oscillator to be further excited . in this way coherence is maintained between the @xmath46 and the @xmath47 beams even when they are spatially separated .",
    "what happens is that the accurate measurement of the energy picks out the plane wave in the wave packet which has existed coherently through both pulses .",
    "our main goal will be to understand how general the above result is .",
    "in other words , to what extent is it true that an ensemble of plane waves will give the same result as wave packets . although there were some initial attempts to distinguish these processes it is now widely believed that they are indistinguishable .",
    "our goal in this paper is to prove some theorems which clarify the conditions under which this is true and to show how general the result is .      before discussing the most general situation",
    "we review here the proof that the coherently and incoherently broadened neutrino beams lead to the same total rate and energy distributions for both @xmath6 s and @xmath60 s .",
    "let us consider two cases representing two possible * electron * neutrino beams leaving some region of the sun at time @xmath41 .",
    "in we have an incoherent mixture of neutrinos each of which is a nearly ideal plane wave ( with some extremely small energy spread @xmath61 ) . in this mixture the probability of finding a neutrino of energy @xmath15 is given by some probability distribution @xmath62 which is centered about some energy @xmath63 with a width @xmath12 . in all the neutrinos",
    "come with the same quantum state .",
    "this state is a wave packet with amplitude @xmath64 for a plane wave component of energy @xmath15 .",
    "we choose this amplitude so that the probability distribution @xmath65 precisely matches the distribution @xmath62 of .",

    "since the @xmath70 are eigenstates of the hamiltonian , at a later time @xmath48 , the wave function is given by ( t)= _ p , i_p , i e^-i_p^(i)tp , i [ eq:22 ] where @xmath71 is the energy of @xmath72 with momentum @xmath67 .",
    "suppose now that at time @xmath48 we measure an observable @xmath73 which _ commutes with the momentum operator_. @xmath73 may , for example , be the total number of electron neutrinos in some range of momenta .",
    "this is , in fact , the most common kind of measurement which can be made . in this case",

    "therefore the expectation value of @xmath73 at time @xmath48 is given by : ( t)q ( t ) = _ p [ eq:23 ] the expression inside the square brackets is precisely the expression for the expectation value @xmath74 of @xmath73 for a plane wave which has a total weight ( i.e. normalization ) @xmath75 and a _ relative _ amplitude @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively at @xmath41 .",

    "[ sec:1 ] that if we use the variation in the earth ",
    "sun distance to look for oscillations in the neutrinos from @xmath78 both the coherent and the incoherent neutrino beams give the same oscillation pattern .",
    "priori the above theorem is not applicable since the experiment involves measuring the spatial dependence of the neutrino flux which involves the use of an operator which does not commute with momentum .",
    "this is however an example for which the conversion of spatial to temporal dependence can be done reliably .",
    "thus , although we measure the spatial variation in the neutrino flux , we can compute the temporal dependence of this flux by computing , for example , the total number of electron neutrinos with a given energy as a function of time .",
    "this estimate will be reliable since , as discussed previously , even the `` plane wave '' packet is still extremely small ( certainly much less than a cm in size ) relative to the relevant astronomical scales .",
    "the above proof that an ensemble of plane waves can not be distinguished , at the detector , from an ensemble of wave packets with the same energy distribution can be extended to the case of neutrino oscillations in matter ( the msw effect)@xcite . to this end",

    "the two cases are shown pictorially in figure i.    all the above information is given to the experimenter together with the additional information that the @xmath45 and @xmath67 distributions for both cases are equal at @xmath41 .",
    "the question is : with only this information can the experimenter distinguish with any experiment the cases a and b above ?    intuitively one might guess that the answer is `` yes '' .",

    "we are free to choose the form of the wave function with the only constraint that its spread in position is approximately equal to @xmath109 with a corresponding momentum spread @xmath110 .",

    "the claim is that we can * always * choose the distributions in step 3 so that the density matrix for step 3 is identical to that of step 2 .",
    "this then implies that any measurement at all which is done on the two ensembles * at any time @xmath48 * gives the same result !",
    "! we also claim the converse of this theorem namely that given a `` wave packet '' ensemble constructed as in step 3 it is always possible to find a `` plane wave '' ensemble as constructed in step 1 with the same density matrix .",
    "note how the mass eigenstates @xmath46 and @xmath47 appear nowhere in the above discussion .",
    "the reason for this and , in our opinion , the power of this proof is that it relies entirely on properties of the system at @xmath41 at which time the state is a pure @xmath6 state .",

    "( [ eq:45 ] ) is satisfied to order @xmath139 as required .",
    "although the result proven above is not entirely general it is sufficient for all cases of practical interest .",
    "the reason for this is that we have actually proven three things .",
    "the result that measurements which commute with momentum could not distinguish coherent from incoherent broadening was completely general and did not depend on the shape of the wave packet nor on its width .",
    "secondly the proof that for gaussian wave packets the two effects could not be distinguished with * any * measurement was also general and it did not depend on the width of the gaussians .",
    "thirdly our extension of the proof to arbitrary wave packet shapes was possible in the limit @xmath109 .",
    "a practical attempt to distinguish the two mechanisms of broadening would likely begin with a theoretical calculation which assumes gaussian wave packets for simplicity . furthermore it would likely compare the wave packets to actual plane waves for which @xmath140 .",
    "we have * shown * that any such attempt is doomed to failure .",
    "we conjecture that the result is more general so that for an arbitrary shape of wave packet it is possible to find an ensemble of nearly plane waves which mimic its behavior exactly .",
    "an interesting corollary to the result proven in the previous section is that one can not tell , on an event by event basis , whether one has a wave packet or a `` plane wave '' .",
    "the proof is as follows : suppose it were possible , on an event by event basis , to distinguish a wave packet from a plane wave",
    ". it would then be trivially possible to distinguish the cases a and b above since in one case we are presented with a plane wave and in the other case with a wave packet .",
    "in fact in just one event we would know with which case we are dealing .",
    "but , as we saw in the previous section we can not do this since the density matrices for the two cases are identical .",
    "it follows that no such determination can be made on an event by event basis .",
    "this result does not contradict the recent work of several authors@xcite on the ability to measure the wave function of a single particle via a `` protective measurement '' .",
    "there are at least two requirements for such a measurement to be possible .",
    "the first is that the system needs an energy gap so that successive ( soft ) measurements keep the particle in the same state .",
    "the second requirement is that it is known a ",
    "priori that the system is in an eigenstate of the hamiltonian .",
    "thus , for example , it is in principle possible to measure the ground state wave function of a typical atom even on a single atom but , if we do not know whether the atom is in an eigenstate of the hamiltonian or in a superposition of eigenstates then this can not be determined on a single atom .",
    "an argument very similar to that in the previous paragraph can be used to prove this result . in our case",
    "neither of these conditions are satisfied .",
    "we do not have a gap and we certainly are not in an eigenstate of the hamiltonian when we are dealing with a wave packet and/or we start with a pure flavor state such as a @xmath141 .    the theorem presented in the previous section also provides a general tool for understanding how the size of a quantum mechanical wave packet affects physical results in various circumstances .",
    "in fact the style of our proof which relies on the _ initial _ properties of the system rather than on the details of its time evolution is extremely useful .",
    "there have been several instances in which either careless approximations or faulty logic have lead to conclusions which disagree with our very general result .",
    "to illustrate this point imagine , instead of using our general proof , that we evolve each of the two ensembles to a later time @xmath48 and * then * compared them . we must , by our theorem , get the same density matrix for each ensemble .",
    "but in doing this calculation we might make several approximations to simplify the calculation .",
    "we might , for example , neglect the longitudinal spreading of the wave packet .",
    "it turns out that even when this spreading is negligible compared to the size of the wave packet it has a significant effect on the final density matrices and we would find significant differences between the two ensembles . we know from our theorem that this can not be the case .",
    "indeed when the effect of longitudinal spreading is included all results computed with @xmath122 and @xmath123 agree .",
    "[ s5 ]    the main focus of this paper was the question of our ability experimentally ( even in principle ) to distinguish incoherent broadening of a neutrino line ( such as the @xmath78 solar neutrino line ) from coherent broadening of such a line .",
    "of particular interest was whether these two types of broadening would have different effects on neutrino oscillations and the msw effect .",
    "we began by identifying processes which contribute to these mechanisms of broadening .",
    "coherent broadening results from several processes including the natural width of the emitting nucleus , pressure broadening caused by collisions of this nucleus and the finite size of the wave packet of the captured electron .",
    "we argued that this last process leads to the smallest estimate for the spatial size of the neutrino wave packet ( @xmath142 cm ) .",
    "incoherent broadening results mainly from the thermal energy spread of the captured electron as well as from the doppler shift due to the thermal motion of the emitting nucleus .",
    "we then began to present our argument that although the two forms of broadening were distinct physical processes which could be controlled at the source they could not be distinguished at the detector .",
    "we first showed that if the detector had an excellent energy resolution not only could oscillations due to an incoherent ensemble of ( nearly ) monoenergetic neutrinos be restored but oscillations of a coherent neutrino beam could also be restored despite the physical separation of the @xmath46 and the @xmath47 at the detector .",
    "we then proved that the measurement of any operator which commuted with momentum could never distinguish a wave packet from a plane wave .",
    "we extended the proof of this result to the case in which the neutrino propagates in matter ( the msw effect ) .",
    "the next stage was to show that if we had no a ",
    "priori knowledge of any difference in the properties of the coherent versus the incoherent neutrino `` beams '' there was @xmath143 measurement which could distinguish them .",
    "our method was to show that it was possible to construct two ensembles , one corresponding to `` nearly plane waves '' and the other to wave packets which had the same density matrix at @xmath41 .",
    "this would imply that the density matrices were equal at all later times and that no measurements could distinguish the two cases .",
    "we presented a complete proof in the case of gaussian wave packets by showing that the density matrix at the source for an ensemble of plane waves with a given ( gaussian ) energy distribution was * equal * to that of an ensemble of wave packets each with a much narrower @xmath45 distribution but distributed , incoherently , over the same range of positions as the `` incoherent '' ensemble .",
    "we extended this proof to the case of non  gaussian wave packets in the limit that the spatial size of the wave packet was much smaller than the spatial size of the `` nearly plane wave '' .",
    "we conjectured that the result is even more general and that given any ensemble of `` nearly plane waves '' with a given energy and position distribution we can construct an ensemble of wave packets which has precisely the same density matrix .",
    "there have been claims in the literature that wave packets could give different results than plane waves with the same momentum distribution .",
    "these differences show up either when the neutrinos are nearly nonrelativistic or when their momentum distribution is extremely broad so that @xmath144 .",
    "this of course implies that some of the components of the neutrino wave function are nonrelativistic and that some of the neutrinos are moving `` backwards '' . in all these cases it is essential to include the longitudinal spreading of the neutrino wave packet and to remember that if one calculates the number of neutrinos which should be observed at some location @xmath45 one must compute the flux of neutrinos which involves the neutrino velocity .",
    "if these cautions are kept in mind one confirms the results of our theorem that there are no differences between the two scenarios .",
    "although we have chosen to focus this paper on neutrinos and neutrino oscillations it is clear that the result is much more general .",
    "it applies to any particle for which the question of the distinguishability of a wave packet from plane waves is relevant .",
    "some examples include neutral kaon oscillations and the effect of wave packets in scattering theory .",
