    "a _ link of @xmath0 components _ is the image of a flat embedding @xmath1 of the ordered disjoint union of @xmath0 oriented copies of the circle @xmath2 .",
    "two such links are called _ concordant _ if there exists a flat embedding @xmath3 \\into s^{3}\\times [ 0,1]\\ ] ] which restricts to the given links at the ends .",
    "a link is called ( topologically ) _ slice _ if it is concordant to the trivial @xmath0component link or , equivalently , if it bounds a flat embedding of @xmath0 disjoint _ slice _ disks @xmath4 . in the special case @xmath5",
    "we refer to the link as a knot . if the embeddings above are required to be @xmath6 , or _ smooth _ , then these notions are called _ smoothly concordant _ and _ smoothly slice_.    the study of link concordance was initiated by fox and milnor in the early @xmath7 arising from their study of isolated singularities of @xmath8-spheres in @xmath9-manifolds .",
    "it is now known that specific questions about link concordance are equivalent to whether or not the surgery and s - cobordism theorems ( that hold true in higher dimensions ) hold true for topological @xmath9-manifolds .",
    "moreover , the difference between a link being topologically slice and being smoothly slice can be viewed as `` atomic '' for the existence of multiple differential structures on a fixed topological @xmath9-manifold .",
    "there is only one known way to construct a smoothly slice link , namely as the boundary of a set of _ ribbon disks",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the known constructions of ( topologically ) slice links are also fairly limited .",
    "in @xmath10 michael freedman proved that any knot with alexander polynomial @xmath11 is slice  @xcite .",
    "it is known that some of these knots can not be smoothly slice and hence can not arise from the ribbon construction .",
    "freedman  @xcite and later freedman and teichner  @xcite gave other techniques showing that the _",
    "whitehead doubles _ of various links are slice .",
    "the @xmath9-dimensional surgery and s - cobordism theorems ( for all fundamental groups ) are in fact equivalent to the _ free _ sliceness of whitehead doubles of all links with vanishing linking numbers , see @xcite . here",
    "a link is _ freely _ slice if the complement of some set of slice disks in @xmath12 has free fundamental group .",
    "however , it is conjectured that :      since vanishing linking numbers corresponds to vanishing milnor invariants of length  2 , the above conjecture ( applied to , say , the borromean rings ) would imply that one of those theorems does not hold for free groups .",
    "the conjecture is known for links with one or two components ( @xcite ) but is widely open for all other cases , the harder part being the `` only if '' direction . continuing the history of constructions for slice links ,",
    "the second two authors recently found a new technique for knots , including examples that are not ribbon knots , do not have alexander polynomial @xmath11 and are not whitehead doubles  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss a method of constructing slice links that generalizes many of the above .",
    "the construction begins with a ribbon knot or link and modifies it by a procedure called a _",
    "multi - infection _",
    "( previously called _ infection by a string link _",
    "@xcite and a _ tangle sum _",
    "* section  1 ) ) which generalizes the classical satellite construction .",
    "special cases of this construction have been used extensively since the late @xmath14 s to exhibit interesting examples of knots and links that are _ not slice _  @xcite .",
    "therefore the present paper complements these results , giving hope for an eventual complete resolution of the question of when this construction results in a slice knot or link .",
    "our result also provides a method of producing interesting examples for testing the new obstructions to a knot or link being smoothly slice @xcite .    in order to state our main theorem",
    "we now define the multi - infection of a link by a string link . by an _ @xmath15multi  disk _",
    "@xmath16 we mean the oriented disk @xmath17 together with @xmath15 ordered embedded open disks @xmath18        ( cf .",
    "figure [ multi_disk ] ) . given a link @xmath19",
    "we say that a map @xmath20 of an @xmath15multi  disk into @xmath21 is _ proper _ if it is an embedding such that the image of the multi  disk ( which we denote by @xmath22 ) intersects the link components transversely and only in the images of the disks @xmath18        as in figure [ multi_infection ] .",
    "now let @xmath23 $ ] be an ( unoriented ) @xmath15-component string link .",
    "then we can thicken up @xmath24 using the orientation of @xmath22 , and tie @xmath25 into @xmath26 along @xmath22 ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : infection ] ) .       note that",
    "after resolving the self  intersections of @xmath27 we can contract @xmath27 in the complement of @xmath26 to the trivial knot , in particular @xmath27 is homotopically trivial in @xmath28 .",
    "it now follows immediately from corollary [ corthm ] that @xmath29 is topologically slice for any knot @xmath30 .",
    "also note that @xmath27 is unknotted in the complement of each component , in particular if @xmath26 has components @xmath31 and @xmath32 , then @xmath29 also has components @xmath31 and @xmath32 , albeit linked differently .    in the very special case",
    "that @xmath26 is the trivial link and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are disjointly embedded disks , then one can see that @xmath29 is the bing double of the whitehead double of @xmath30 .",
    "it is well  known that this link is in general not smoothly slice .",
    "we refer to @xcite to a summary of known obstructions to the bing double of a whitehead double being smoothly slice .",
