    "in this paper we study the spaces of conformal blocks for one dimensional lattice vertex operator algebras .    spaces of conformal blocks or modular functor ( see @xcite ) play an important role in conformal field theory .",
    "they can be defined for a wide class of vertex operator algebras and they parameterizes the states of the corresponding field theory . to avoid cumbersome notion",
    "let us describe our approach for affine algebras ( which corresponds to the wznw theory ) .",
    "first , recall the definition of the space of conformal blocks .",
    "let @xmath1 be a simple lie algebra , by @xmath2 denote the central extension of the lie algebra of @xmath1valued laurent polynomials .",
    "fix a level @xmath3 , that is , identify the central element of @xmath2 with the positive integer @xmath3 . as a geometric part of the data consider a complex curve @xmath4 and a set of pairwise distinct points @xmath5 with a local coordinate in a small vicinity of each point .",
    "then define the lie algebra @xmath6 of @xmath1-valued meromorphic functions on @xmath4 with poles only at @xmath7 .",
    "clearly we have the inclusion @xmath8 mapping any @xmath1-valued function to its laurent expansions at the points @xmath9 .",
    "another part of the data is a set of integrable representations @xmath10 of @xmath2 at level @xmath3 .",
    "their external tensor product is a representation of @xmath11 and , therefore , of @xmath12 .",
    "then the space of conformal block is defined as the space of coinvariants @xmath13 i.e. the quotient of @xmath14 by the action of @xmath15 .",
    "it is well known that these spaces are finite - dimensional and form a flat family over the module space of curves with punctures .    in @xcite",
    "another construction is proposed .",
    "let , as above , @xmath4 be a curve , @xmath9 and @xmath16 be pairwise distinct points on @xmath4 .",
    "then consider the subalgebra @xmath17 of functions with zeroes at @xmath9 and the subalgebra @xmath18 of functions whose values at @xmath9 belongs to the nilpotent borel subalgebra @xmath19 .",
    "then for any integrable representation @xmath20 at level @xmath3 we have the natural isomorphisms ( see @xcite ) @xmath21 where sum goes over all the sets of integrable representations at level @xmath3 and @xmath22 denotes the finite - dimensional representation of @xmath1 generated by the highest vector of @xmath23 .",
    "so the space of coinvariants of a single representation @xmath20 contains the spaces of conformal blocks where @xmath20 appears .",
    "an advantage of this construction is that these spaces of coinvariants is well defined if some of the points @xmath24 coincides . in this case",
    "we just consider zeroes with multiplicities . for multiple points we have not isomorphisms  ,  , but it is easy to show that these spaces form a coherent sheaf over the variety @xmath25 of sets of points on @xmath4 .",
    "first question is whether the dimension of the space of coinvariants preserves when some points coincides .",
    "indeed , this question is local and it is enough to check this when @xmath4 is the riemann sphere .",
    "the answer is positive for @xmath26 ( see @xcite for @xmath27 and @xcite for @xmath28 ) and negative for @xmath29 .",
    "also there is the positive answer for the similar question about the @xmath30-minimal models of the virasoro algebras ( see @xcite ) .",
    "but the general case is far from been studied . here",
    "we prove the equality of dimensions in the case of one dimensional lattice voas .",
    "another question is about the natural filtration on these spaces .",
    "namely , the affine lie algebra @xmath1 and its integrable representations are graded by the action of the energy element .",
    "but the subalgebras defined above are not homogeneous ( except the case of riemann sphere and @xmath31 ) , hence the spaces of coinvariants can be considered only as filtered spaces .",
    "nevertheless we consider the hilbert polynomials @xmath32 of the adjoint graded spaces and interpret them as a @xmath0-analog of the correspondent verlinde numbers ( which are dimensions of spaces of conformal blocks ) .",
    "this object is interesting even in the case of the riemann sphere ( and well studied only in this case ) . in @xcite",
    "there is a conjecture that expresses @xmath32 in terms of generalized @xmath0-supernomial coefficients . for @xmath30-minimal models of the virasoro",
    "algebras the polynomials @xmath32 take part in the andrews - gordon identities and therefore can be decomposed into sums of @xmath0-multinomial coefficients as well . in this paper",
    "we prove a formula ( see theorem  [ th : char ] , ( ii ) ) which expresses @xmath32 for one - dimensional lattice voas as a sum of @xmath0-supernomial coefficients . note that this formula can be considered as another definition of @xmath0-supernomials .",
    "these two question are connected .",
    "namely , suppose that the dimension preserves when the points coincides .",
    "then in the case of the riemann sphere it is enough to find @xmath32 for the graded subalgebra with @xmath31 .",
    "it makes possible to degenerate the algebra together with the subalgebra into an abelian one or a rather simple voa and obtain a fermionic type ( in terms of @xcite ) formula for @xmath32 .",
    "such a formula exists for @xmath33 ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , for @xmath30-minimal models of the virasoro algebra ( see @xcite ) and for one - dimensional lattice voas ( see theorem  [ th : char ] , ( i ) ) .    in more general cases ( @xmath34-algebras , lattice voas , etc . )",
    "it is not evident which subalgebras should be chosen instead of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "let us explain what we are doing in the case of affine lie algebras . introduce some `` elementary '' graded subalgebras @xmath37 . as the subalgebras are graded , they consist of @xmath1-valued functions with some local conditions at the zero point",
    ". then define the `` fused '' subalgebra @xmath38 of functions with pole only in @xmath16 and local conditions in @xmath7 prescribed by the subalgebras @xmath39 .",
    "then we have @xmath40 in particular , the subalgebra @xmath41 is fused from @xmath42 copies of the affine nilpotent borel subalgebra @xmath43 and the subalgebra @xmath44 is fused from @xmath42 copies of the affine nilpotent parabolic subalgebra @xmath45 , so and follows from .",

    "[ sec : lvoa ] we recall some facts about lattice vertex operator algebras ( `` voa '' ) and their representations . in sec .  [ sec : ass ] we introduce an associative algebra that acts in each representation of the voa .",
