    "random walks have been studied for a long time now in order to obtain information about the effect of dimensionality , symmetry , and topological structures on the general properties of classical transport phenomena . via the central limit theorem",
    "the gaussian distribution plays a fundamental role for all random walks ( dynamic semigroup ) with finite mean square displacement per step @xcite .",
    "levy flights are classical markovian random walks in a continuous space with infinite mean square displacement per step ( thus levy flights are not in the attractor of the gaussian distribution ) .",
    "the interesting point about these walks is that the set of points visited by these levy flights has a self - similar clustering property , so a fractal dimension has been extensively discussed and in particular magnificently illustrated by mandelbrot @xcite .",
    "a weierstrass random walk is a discrete ( lattice ) version of levy flights which was introduced by schlesinger et al .",
    "this transport model ( also called levy walk ) shows the fractal nature of the random walk trajectory , and several mathematical concepts such as non - differentiable function , lacunary taylor series , fractals , renormalization group transformation , etc .",
    ", have been related to this weierstrass random walk and mapped to important characteristics of transport phenomena @xcite .",
    "recently it has been reported that power - law discrete - stable ( step ) distributions can be obtained as the stationary state of immigration markov processes @xcite , showing that the statistics of the steps of the particle is inherited from the @xmath0tuplets rates ( mesoscopic ) fluctuations appearing in the master equation @xcite . to tackle",
    "this kind of program from a non - classical point of view is much more harder because in quantum mechanics it is necessary to include the cause of damping and noise explicitly , thus apart from the hamiltonian of the system of interest @xmath1 one has to include a thermal bath @xmath2 an interaction between both @xcite .",
    "the program of the present work is not in the direction of reference @xcite , rather our purpose here can be presented in two fold : first to get a quantum semigroup description of a mechanical particle that moves doing scale - free hopping along a lattice of sites , and second to study the quantum decoherence phenomena in a long - range dissipative model . in order to achieve this program we will adopt the simplest quantum mechanical assumptions to get an analytical model .    to gain insight into the relationship between dimensionality , topological structures and disorder ,",
    "many quantum models of transport phenomena have been introduced @xcite . among them",
    "the _ tight - binding _",
    "approximation for a quantum particle over a regular structure with nearest - neighbor ( nn )  interactions , is a simple description which is equivalent to the quantum random walk ( qrw ) , a quantum particle that moves along a lattice of sites doing nn steps while interacting with a bath vk95,moc - ch97 .",
    "one of the most interesting facts that distinguishes quantum mechanics from classical mechanics is the coherent superposition of distinct physical states .",
    "many of the non - intuitive aspects of the quantum theory of matter can be traced to the coherent superposition feature .",
    "two important question are :    @xmath3 how does the coherent superposition operate in the presence of dissipation ?",
    "@xmath3 how does a long - range interaction characterize quantum decoherence ?",
    "these subjects have been important issues of research since the pioneer works of feynmann and vernon @xcite , caldeira and leggett @xcite among others , see for example the references cited in : @xcite .",
    "the study of a quantum walk subjected to different sources of decoherence is an active topic that has been considered by several authors , in particular , by their interest in understanding laser cooling experiments bouchaud03 , modeling blinking statistics @xcite , and also in doing quantum simulations @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the most usual laser cooling scheme is based on the idea that the microscopic quantum description of subrecoil cooling can be replaced by a study of a related random ( anomalous ) walk in momentum space , this is the point where the concept of levy waiting - time , for the statistical description of the elapsed time between walks , appears .",
    "the definition of our quantum levy walk ( qlw ) is base in a long - range jump model without introducing any waiting - time statistics .",
    "the physical motivation of using a levy - like probability for the jump was inspired on recent experiments showing long - range interaction as in rydberg gases @xcite .",
    "we end this paragraph noting that our qlw is quite different from the quantum walk with levy waiting - time .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a _ scale free _ open quantum model , i.e. , a quantum mechanical particle that moves along a lattice through hopping scale free while interacting with a thermal phonon bath .",
    "we have chosen the interaction hamiltonian with the bath in such a way that it produces a long - range superposition of vector states .",
    "we highlight some of the issues of interpretation of the coherent superposition by tackling a soluble long - range hopping model .",
    "the asymptotic long - time regime of the quantum purity is characterized by a long - tail with a non - trivial exponent that depends on the weierstrass parameters of the hamiltonian . a long - time coherent behavior for the localized correlation function is also explained in terms of the present scale free hopping model .",
    "in appendix a we present some formal aspects of quantum dynamic semigroups , and we revisit the second order approximation obtained for an open quantum system weakly coupled to the environment plenio , blum , spohn , alicki , kossa , lindblad , davies , qn , kampen . thus we emphasize some general conditions on the system of interest , the environment and the interaction hamiltonian to obtain a true semigroup . in the core of the paper we present our open quantum model : _ the quantum levy walk _ , which is a generalization of the qrw hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "then we obtain the evolution equation for the reduced density matrix under the markovian approximation @xcite , its solution , and solve analytically some correlation functions associated to the coherent superposition feature .",
    "for open quantum systems , the markovian description of the dynamics is based on the concept of quantum dynamic semigroups @xcite . only with these semigroups are the properties of the reduced density matrix of the quantum system of interest , preserved during the whole time evolution ( positivity , trace and hermiticity ) @xcite . from a microscopic description considering the total hamiltonian of the system of interest and the environment , it is possible to derive a picture involving the quantum dynamic semigroups .",
    "one of the pioneers work in obtaining the qrw model from first principles can be found in van kampen s paper @xcite , where it is shown that tracing out the baths variables a bona - fide semigroup is obtained . here",
    "we will do something similar , but introducing a scale free hamiltonian , for the free particle , and generalizing the interaction with the phonon thermal bath .",
    "let the system @xmath1 be a free particle that can reside in any lattice site @xmath4 the dynamics of the system @xmath5 will be described by the hamiltonian@xmath6where the shift operators @xmath7 act on the orthonormal set of wannier basis @xmath8 that spans the hilbert space @xmath9 .",
    "a general form for these shift operators can be expressed as:@xmath10with @xmath11 and fulfilling normalization to one , to help its physical interpretation .",
    "a particular choice of @xmath12 will describe a tight - binding - like hamiltonian ranging form nn to long - range hopping , thus the set @xmath7 will be the fundamental operators to modelling the interaction hamiltonian between system @xmath1 and the bath ( a thermal set of oscillators ) , see appendix a. a classical one dimensional random walk is defined in terms of the probability for a particle to make a step of a given length to the left or to the right .",
    "quantum random walk hamiltonians are described instead in terms of probabilities amplitudes ( here the shift operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "related nn  discrete - time models are ( coined ) quantum random walks @xcite .",
    "also the nn random walk hamiltonian ( in a ring ) has been used to study transport in a quantum trapping model @xcite .",
    "quantum random walk , is the counterpart of a classical random walk for particles which can not be precisely localized due to quantum uncertainties . when @xmath15 with lattice parameter @xmath16 we reobtain the usual nn random walk in the line @xcite .",
    "when @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 we get the gillis and weiss lattice walk model @xcite , etc .",
    "if @xmath12 is characterized by a power - law probability we obtain a levy - like jumping walk , this type of quantum walk has been previously reported in order to study long - range interaction in a non - dissipative model @xcite , as well as in a trapping transport model @xcite . here",
    "we propose to study a jumping model characterized by the weierstrass probability , this class of lacunary long - range probability has been widely study in classical transport phenomena , nevertheless up to our knowledge nothing has been reported in the context of quantum transport .",
    "two important consequence appear from the definitions ( [ a - general ] ) and ( a - general2 ) : using that @xmath21 belongs to the wannier index we can see that @xmath13 and @xmath22 are diagonal in the fourier basis , this fact leads to the conclusion that also @xmath23 will be diagonal , and also it can be proved that @xmath13 and @xmath22 commute .",
    "these results will be shown in the appendix b for the particular weierstrass jumping probability .",
    "we define the weierstrass shift operators in the form:@xmath24this means that the application in the weierstrass shift operators to any vector @xmath25 produces a linear combination in the wannier basis .",
    "this linear combination is scale free and has a clustering structure @xcite .",
    "this clustering is characterized in average by the probability @xmath26 to have a projection on a wannier vector distant @xmath27 from @xmath25 . for example@xmath28",
    "interestingly as we mention before , @xmath29=0;\\ \\forall \\mathcal{a}>1,\\forall b(\\mbox{integer})\\geq 1,\\]]this and other important results are shown in appendix b.    we noted that only in the case @xmath30 the operators @xmath13 and @xmath22 are _ truly _ translation operators , in the sense that the product of successive translations is equivalent to one resultant translation , i.e. , for example the application of @xmath31 translations gives:@xmath32therefore it is simple to see that taking @xmath30 in ( [ shift ] ) we reobtain the qrw model @xcite .    in general for @xmath33",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath23 describes a scale free tight - binding - like hamiltonian ( the qlw model ) , i.e. , a quantum free particle in a lattice that moves , making hopping like a levy walk , while interacting with a bath ( in the present paper we work in a discrete one dimensional infinite hilbert space ) .",
    "the eigenfunctions of @xmath23 are denoted by the kets @xmath34 ( with @xmath35 ) and are given by the fourier transform of the wannier vectors:@xmath36thus @xmath37 , where @xmath38    the eigenenergy @xmath39 can be related to lacunary taylor and fourier series @xcite . from ( [ ek ] ) we can define @xmath40 , this function obeys the scaling equation @xmath41it has been shown @xcite that the nonanalytic part @xmath42 of @xmath43 satisfies the homogeneous equation @xmath44so that @xmath45here @xmath46 is a bounded function periodic in @xmath47 with period @xmath48 of quite intrincated structure hsm81 .",
    "therefore our eigenenergy @xmath39 shares some similarities with critical phenomena analysis ( renormalization group transformation ) .",
    "in addition if the parameter @xmath49 is an integer it has been shown @xcite that the power series in @xmath50 of @xmath43 , has gaps or missing terms .",
    "these gaps lead , by using the fabry s theorem , to the concept of noncontinuability of the series of @xmath43 , and so to the conclusion that @xmath43 has extremely complicated behavior as a function of @xmath51 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath52 , @xmath43 is weierstrass example of a function which at no point possesses a finite derivative .",
    "when this result is translated to the eigenenergy @xmath39 we may conclude that the density of states ( dos ) is not well defined if @xmath53 this will be shown also in the next subsection , see eq .",
    "( [ diverge ] ) .",
    "as we mentioned before the type of hamiltonians ( [ h ] ) , with shift operators as presented in ( [ a - general ] ) and ( [ a - general2 ] ) , share the properties of been diagonalized in fourier space .",
    "the important point of our weierstrass quantum model is that the eigenenergy turns to be non differentiable for the critical value @xmath52 ( i.e. , @xmath54 ) , this fact will be analyzed in the context of the time evolution of the reduced density matrix , in detail , in the next sections .",
    "an analysis concerning quantum walks with long - range steps ( but without dissipation ) was carried out by mlken et al .",
    "@xcite , in that paper it was shown that there exist a universal behavior for the quantum walks which is different from the universality of long - range classical random walks . in our present work",
    "we go one step forward and study a long - range quantum walk coupled to a thermal bath , then new universalities are found for the decoherence of the system .      using the green function of the hamiltonian @xmath23 the dos can straightforwardly be calculated if we known the matrix elements of @xmath55 ^{-1}$ ] , for example by using the formula @xmath56 .$ ] nevertheless for the particular case of our qlw hamiltonian , and due to the fact that we already have an analytic expression for the continuous energy eigenvalue @xmath57 , it is more convenient here to calculate the dos by the alternative formula@xmath58 ^{-1 } ,   \\notag\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath59 are the solutions of the transcendental equation : @xmath60 . from ( [ ek ] ) we see that@xmath61then we expect that when @xmath62 the right - hand - side may diverge for some values of @xmath63 .",
    "this fact  ultimately leads the dos to be not well defined , this issue can be seen as the occurrence of a complex null - set inside the brillouin zone , and is in agreement with the previous mathematical report , coming from ( [ scaling ] ) , on the non differentiability of @xmath43 when @xmath52 . only when @xmath64  the eigenenergy @xmath39 is differentiable anywhere and the behavior of the dos for the weierstrass model shares analogies with the dos numerically calculated by mlken et al .",
    "in a long - range model @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) in the limit @xmath65 is the qrw model @xcite , then as expected , we can reobtain from ( [ ek ] ) the usual _ tight - binding _",
    "eigenvalues @xmath66 , and from ( [ dos ] ) the corresponding dos:@xmath67    in conclusion : for @xmath33 the dos follows from ( [ dos ] ) , but this density only is _",
    "well defined _ under the constraint @xmath68 in the opposite case @xmath69 the dos is not defined because the function @xmath70 is non - differentiable . in figure 1",
    "we have plotted @xmath39  for several values of weierstrass parameters @xmath71 , in this plot the non differentiable signature of the eigenenergy of the levy walk hamiltonian can clearly be seen .",
    "here it is important to note the difference with the _ classical _ characteristic function of the weierstrass random walk ( discrete space levy flight @xcite ) . in the classical",
    "walk the condition to have an infinite mean square displacement per step is @xmath72 ( because the second moment is given by the second derivative of @xmath43 ) .",
    "then when clustering occurs , the number of subclusters within a distance @xmath27 of the origin is , on average , @xmath73 .",
    "note that for the _ classical walk _ , the characteristic function of the weierstrass walk is non - differentiable when @xmath74 .",
    "then it is possible to call  to the value @xmath75 the _ hausdorff - besicovitch dimension _ of the set of sites visited by a classical walk @xcite . in quantum mechanics a similar analysis could be done in the context of the schdringer - langevin picture @xcite , i.e. , without using the density matrix .",
    "we want to remark that if @xmath52 ( @xmath54 ) the eigenenergy @xmath76  is non - differentiable and the dos  is not well defined . a rigorous calculus based on the scaling properties ( [ scaling ] ) of the eigenenergy leads to the conclusion that the record of @xmath76 as a function of @xmath51 , for @xmath49 above the critical value @xmath77 , is a self - affine function .",
    "in fact , a fractal dimension can be measured ( for example ) by using the box - counting technique and the prediction gives @xmath78 for @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "an alternative technique based in the analysis properties of the zero crossing @xcite has recently been reported to be suitable to characterizes processes that are continuous , but the _ derivative _ has fractal properties .",
    "interestingly many years ago these processes were termed subfractals  @xcite .",
    "note that we are assuming _ integer _",
    "values for @xmath49 to avoid non - commensurability problems for the walk in the associated discrete infinite dimensional hilbert space @xmath80 of lattice parameter @xmath81 ( at the end of appendix b we present some discussion on the case when the lattice parameter @xmath82 goes to the continuous limit ) .      concerning the quantum bath ( see appendix a for details )",
    ", we will assume that the thermal bath @xmath2 is an infinite set of oscillators , and that the interaction with the phonon bath causes the free particle to jump either to the right or to the left .",
    "thus we consider the operators @xmath83 appearing in the interaction hamiltonian ( [ hi ] ) to be proportional to the weierstrass shift operators @xmath13 and @xmath22 defined in eq .",
    "( shift ) . in the present paper",
    "we will study a particular coupling with the heat bath , nevertheless going back to appendices a , b and c it is straightforward to write down the qme  considering any other type of coupling .",
    "for example : if @xmath84 we can model an interaction that in the continuos limit ( lattice parameter going to zero ) coupled the velocity of the free particle with the heat bath .",
    "taking into account that @xmath85=0 $ ] we trivially get that in the heisenberg representation weierstrass s shift operator does not have a time evolution , i.e.,:@xmath86this result ultimately will lead to the fact that the kossakowski - lindblad ( kl ) generator @xcite will be completely positive @xcite .",
    "thus , using eqs .",
