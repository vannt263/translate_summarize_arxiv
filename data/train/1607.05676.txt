    "due to their intermediate spatial extension , @xmath2-electrons in transition metal compounds comprise both the localized and itinerant features .",
    "this duality is manifested in a rich variety of metal - insulator transitions @xcite .",
    "even deep in the mott - insulating phase , the @xmath2-electrons partially retain their kinetic energy , by making virtual hoppings to the neighboring sites and forming the covalent bonds .",
    "the internal structure of these bonds is dictated by the orbital shape of @xmath2-electrons as well as by pauli principle and hund s interactions among spins .",
    "this results in an intimate link between the nature of chemical bonds ( `` orbital order '' ) and magnetism @xcite , which can be cast in terms of phenomenological goodenough - kanamori rules .",
    "the kugel - khomskii models @xcite form a theoretical framework where the `` spin physics '' and `` orbital chemistry '' are treated on equal footing .",
    "a special feature of these models is that the @xmath2-orbital is spatially anisotropic and hence can not satisfy all the bonds simultaneously . in high symmetry crystals , this results in a picture of fluctuating orbitals @xcite , where the frustration among different covalent bonds is resolved by virtue of their quantum superposition , lifting the orbital degeneracy without a static order .",
    "it might seem that a relativistic spin - orbit coupling , which lifts the orbital degeneracy already on a single ion level @xcite , will readily eliminate the orbital frustration problem .",
    "this coupling does indeed greatly reduce the initially large spin - orbital hilbert space of @xmath2-ions , leaving often just a twofold degenerate kramers level with an effective ( `` pseudo '' ) spin one - half @xcite .",
    "it turns out , however , that the pseudospins still well `` remember '' the orbital frustration , by inheriting the bond - directional nature of orbital interactions via the spin - orbit entanglement @xcite .",
    "the bond - directional nature of pseudospin interactions has profound consequences for magnetism ( as well as for the properties of doped systems @xcite ) .",
    "the most remarkable example , pointed out in ref .",
    ", is a possible realization of the kitaev s honeycomb model @xcite in materials with the @xmath3 electronic configuration such as na@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",
    "this theoretical proposal has sparked a broad interest in honeycomb lattice pseudospin systems ( see the recent review article @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there is a direct experimental evidence @xcite that the kitaev - type interactions are indeed dominant in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",
    "unusual features pointing towards the kitaev model has been observed @xcite also in spin excitation spectra of rucl@xmath1 ( this compound was suggested @xcite to host pseudospin physics , too ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is also clear that there are terms in the pseudospin hamiltonian that take these systems away from the kitaev spin - liquid phase window @xcite .",
    "the identification of these `` undesired '' interactions and clarification of their dependence on material parameters is an important issue that has been in the focus of many recent studies .",
    "experimentally , the strength of a dominant kitaev coupling @xmath4 can readily be evaluated from an overall bandwidth of spin excitations ; however , the determination of its sign and quantification of the subdominant terms is not straightforward and needs a theory support .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that the direction of the ordered moments , which can be extracted from the neutron and diffraction data , contains a valuable information on the model parameters , including the sign of @xmath5 . considering a symmetry dictated form of the model hamiltonian , we calculate the pseudospin direction fully including quantum fluctuations which are expected to be crucial in frustrated spin models",
    ". we will point out that the pseudospin itself is not directly probed by neutrons ; rather , they detect the direction of the _ magnetic _ moment which is not the same as that of the pseudospin .",
    "similarly , we will describe how to extract the pseudospin direction from resonant scattering ( rxs ) data .",

    "finally , appendix [ app : trans ] discusses how the trigonal field can be extracted from @xmath6 magnetic excitation spectra .",
    "to describe the interactions among the pseudospins ( referred to as `` spins '' below ) , we adopt a model containing all symmetry allowed nearest - neighbor ( nn ) terms and the longer - range heisenberg interactions @xmath7 the nearest neighbor contribution is the extended kitaev - heisenberg model @xcite that , apart from the heisenberg interaction , includes all the bond - anisotropic interactions compatible with the symmetries of a trigonally - distorted honeycomb lattice .",

    "the resulting alternation of the local easy axis directions from bond - to - bond , imposed by the ising - like term @xmath5 , brings about a strong frustration which , as discussed above , can be traced back to the orbital frustration problem in kugel - khomskii type models .",

    "given that the stability of the kitaev - liquid phase against perturbations strongly depends on the sign of @xmath5 @xcite , which scenario is realized in a given compound becomes an important issue .",

    "the magnetic anisotropy in the present model is a nontrivial problem , since the leading term @xmath5 is anisotropic by itself , and , on top of this highly frustrated interaction , the other terms which eventually drive a magnetic order in real compounds have a strong impact on magnetic energy profile . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schem](c ) and discussed in detail below , the ordered moment direction is very sensitive to the model parameters , and it shows a qualitatively different behavior in case of fm and af kitaev couplings .",
    "we note that the `` moment direction '' in this figure refers to that of pseudospin ; section vi explains how it is related to the magnetic moments probed by neutron and diffraction experiments .",

    ", an increasing @xmath13 further pushes the moment closer to the honeycomb plane .",
    "as it has been found earlier @xcite and discussed below , the kitaev term generates an additional magnetic anisotropy due to quantum and/or thermal fluctuations , pinning the moment direction to the cubic axes .",
    "this will turn the above jumps into a gradual rotation of the easy axis with changing @xmath13 , along the path shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schem](c ) .",
    "to determine the groundstate of the hamiltonian and obtain the moment direction as a function of model parameters more rigorously than in the previous perturbative methods , we have performed an exact diagonalization using a hexagon - shaped 24-site supercell covering the honeycomb lattice .",
    "this cluster is highly symmetric and compatible with all the hidden symmetries of the model @xcite so that no bias induced by the cluster geometry is expected .",
    "since the cluster groundstate does not spontaneously break the symmetry and corresponds to a superposition of all possible degenerate orderings , the identification of the ordered moment direction is not straightforward .",

    "resonant x - ray scattering is conceptually similar to the raman light scattering , in a sense that both processes involve the intermediate states created and subsequently eliminated by incoming and outgoing photons .",
    "however , the nature of the intermediate states in these two cases is radically different : while the raman light scattering involves intersite @xmath201 transitions , the create the high - energy on - site @xmath202 transitions . as a result , the raman light scattering probes intersite ( two - magnon ) spin flips , while the presence of strong spin - orbit coupled @xmath203-core hole in the rxs intermediate states makes a single - ion spin flips a dominant magnetic scattering channel ( see the recent review @xcite and references therein for details )",
    ".    a complex time - dynamics of the intermediate states makes the scattering process hard to analyze microscopically .",
    "however , as far as one is concerned with the low - energy excitations in mott insulators , the problem of the intermediate states can be disentangled and cast in the form of frequency independent phenomenological constants @xcite .",
    "this results is an effective rxs operator formulated in terms of low - energy ( orbital , spin ,  ) degrees of freedom alone .",
    "the form of this operator is dictated by symmetry .",
    "in essence , this approach is similar to that of fleury and loudon @xcite widely used in the theories of raman light scattering in quantum magnets .",
