    "magnetic random access memory ( mram ) devices based on magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtj ) using ferromagnetic metals and alloys with limited spin polarization will be implemented in next generation computer memory . beyond purely storage usage , mtjs can at the same time be used as programmable logic elements @xcite .",
    "while the device preparation techniques using simple metals and alloys are at least in principle well known , from the point of view of magnetic properties half metallic materials certainly are superior to classical ferromagnetic metals .",
    "magnetite ( fe@xmath0o@xmath1 ) is an interesting candidate , because it has been predicted to be a half - metal even at room temperature due to its high ordering temperature of 860k @xcite .",
    "indeed , spin - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy on magnetite thin films has recently revealed a spin polarisation near the fermi edge of up to 80% at room temperature @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in mtjs only very small tmr effects have been observed @xcite with a maximum effect of 14% @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand the behavior of magnetite at the electrode / barrier interfaces , the influence of the tunneling barrier itself , and the magnetic coupling through thin barriers .    in this paper",
    "we report measurements of mtjs based on epitaxial magnetite thin films on mgo(001 ) single crystal substrates . as tunnel barrier",
    "the five materials mgo , srtio@xmath0 , ndgao@xmath0 , sio@xmath2 , and al@xmath2o@xmath3 have been investigated . as counter - electrode ni was used with about 33% spin polarisation as known from tunneling measurements @xcite .",
    "the whole thin film structure was grown by pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) and electron beam evaporation in an ultra high vacuum system .",
    "the tunnel junctions with areas ranging from @xmath4m@xmath5 to @xmath6m@xmath5 were fabricated by optical lithography and ion beam etching .",
    "the magnetic properties , in particular the coupling of the electrodes through the barrier , have been studied by squid magnetometry .",
    "the magnetotransport behavior of these mtjs was measured as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field .",
    "the thin films were fabricated in an ultra high vacuum ( uhv ) laser ablation system with in - situ electron beam evaporation .",
    "the magnetite thin films were grown epitaxially on mgo single crystal substrates , mostly with an underlying epitaxial tin buffer layer .",
    "details about the whole process including in - situ reflection high energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) and laser substrate heating are described in @xcite . to enhance the surface quality",
    "a telescope optics for the laser beam has been developed , so that for each material the optimal energy density in combination with an optimal focus could be easily achieved .",
    "this was especially important for getting smooth surfaces without droplets which may lead to short circuits through the tunnel barrier .",
    "the surface quality was probed in - situ with an omicron atomic force microscope , the crystal properties and film thickness with a bruker / axs high resolution x - ray - diffractometer , and the magnetic properties with a quantum design superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer .",
    "the magneto - transport measurements were performed in an oxford cryostat system with variable temperature insert and a 10tesla superconducting magnet .",
    "the magnetite thin films achieved nearly the same properties as single crystal bulk material with respect to magnetization on the verwey - transition behavior @xcite .",
    "such high - quality thin films seem to be one of the key prerequisites in order to obtain tmr devices with desired performance .     +    on top of the 40  to  50 nm thin magnetite films , 2  to  7 nm thin layers serving as tunnel barriers are deposited .",
    "five different materials were used : mgo , srtio@xmath0 and ndgao@xmath0 have been fabricated by pld from stoichiometric targets , sio@xmath2 and al layers were deposited by electron beam evaporation in uhv . during pld growth",
    "the ar - atmosphere was 10@xmath7  mbar , and the substrate temperature was 330@xmath8c .",
    "the only material growing epitaxially on fe@xmath0o@xmath1 is mgo as confirmed by the corresponding rheed pattern .",
    "epitaxial growth of mgo is also achieved at room temperature for a pure oxygen atmosphere ( 10@xmath7  mbar ) .",
    "the sio@xmath2 and al layers were deposited without breaking the uhv after the magnetite deposition .",
    "both materials are grown at room temperature . afterwards",
    "the al was oxidized in pure oxygen to form the insulating al@xmath2o@xmath3 .",
    "srtio@xmath0 , ndgao@xmath0 , sio@xmath2 , and al@xmath2o@xmath3 all form amorphous layers on magnetite due to the large crystal lattice mismatch . in a further step , a 40 nm ni layer was deposited in situ as second magnetic electrode by electron beam evaporation in uhv at room temperature .",
    "starting from these multilayers , tunnel junctions have been fabricated using optical lithography and ion beam etching .",
    "the complex production process consists of roughly 35 critical steps . after careful optimization",
    "a yield of more than 50% of reproducible tmr - contacts was achieved corresponding to a yield of 98% for each step .",
    "this high reproducibility is an important prerequisite for a reliable analysis of the tmr - effect . as show in fig .",
    "[ tmr - bruecke ] one measurement bridge contains four tunnel junction in form of small turrets  with areas ranging from @xmath4m@xmath5 to @xmath6m@xmath5 . on a @xmath9 substrate four such structures",

    "[ tmr - contact ] shows a zoom - view of one small tmr - turret .",

    ", one sample has been patterned into a @xmath10 square .",
    "the magnetization behavior of the sample before and after patterning was almost identical .",
    "this means that the magnetization data as measured for the whole chip is valid approximately also for the patterned tmr - contacts .",

    "first , we consider the saturation magnetization @xmath11 .",

    "[ fig2 ] shows a magnetization measurement of a tin / fe@xmath0o@xmath1/mgo / ni multilayer up to above 6 t . for single reference layers of magnetite and",
    "ni we have measured @xmath12 resp .",
    "@xmath13 at room temperature . knowing the film thicknesses within the multilayer consisting of 53 nm magnetite , 5.3 nm mgo , and 35 nm ni on top of a 17 nm tin buffer layer , a saturation magnetization of @xmath14 is expected which is in excellent agreement with the measured value of @xmath15 .",
    "together with the clear step - like shape of the hysteretic @xmath16-curve this is an indication of nearly ideal ferromagnetic order in the electrode layers of the multilayer structures .",
    "this is important with respect to the formation of magnetic domains or glass - like behavior which both is unfavorable for the device performance .",
    "note , that @xmath11 of the thin films is close to the values measured in bulk samples .",
    "for an ideal switching behavior of a tmr - device it is important that both electrodes switch separately at different fields . within this field range , a stable antiparallel configuration of the magnetization of the electrodes",
    "can be achieved .",
    "the difference in resistance of the stable states with perfect parallel and antiparallel order of the magnetization of the electrodes is a key precondition for high tmr - effects @xcite .     at room temperature for two different barrier materials . left panel : fe@xmath0o@xmath1/sio@xmath2/ni .",
    "right panel : tin / fe@xmath0o@xmath1/al@xmath2o@xmath3/ni . ]    we first discuss the behavior of mgo barriers . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , for a barrier of 5.3 nm mgo the difference of the switching fields of fe@xmath0o@xmath1 and ni is only about 7mt at room temperature . at lower temperatures ( 210k and 150k ) the electrodes switch together around applied fields of 30mt .",
    "these switching fields are far away from the typical coercive fields for ni thin films ( @xmath17mt at 5k [ @xmath18 and @xmath19mt at room temperature [ @xmath20 ) which are much smaller as observed in the multilayer structure .",
    "it is evident that the electrodes are strongly coupled through the mgo barrier layer , behaving like almost one ferromagnetic layer .    to investigate the magnetic coupling through the mgo tunnel barrier in more detail",
    ", the same measurements have been repeated with a thicker barrier layer ( 21 nm ) . from atomic force microscopy and x - ray reflectometry measurements indicating a surface roughness below one nm ( root mean square )",
    ", we exclude that short circuits exist through the barrier .",
    "interesting enough , the same coupling phenomenon is observed again . at this moment",
    ", we can only speculate about the origin of this phenomenon .",
    "the first possibility is that fe diffuses into the mgo barrier and vice versa leading to a diluted magnetic system mg@xmath21fe@xmath22o .",
    "while such interdiffusion has only been observed after annealing processes at much higher temperatures @xcite , here the pld process with a cloud of @xmath23ev particles could drive interdiffusion between the two well lattice matched systems mgo and fe@xmath0o@xmath1 . in contrast , electron beam evaporation or plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy @xcite deals with almost thermalized atoms . within this model , at increasing temperature the coupling is decreased due to the decreased order of the magnetic insulating layer .",
    "the second possible origin of the magnetic coupling through the mgo barrier , is related to recent ideas about new types of ferromagnets due to the presence of specific point defects in low concentration @xcite .",
    "point defects due to mg vacancies within such models are responsible for local  magnetic moments .",
    "also , oxygen deficient systems might in a similar way lead to ferromagnetic behavior .",
    "however , for the purpose of tmr devices , non - magnetic insulating tunnel barriers are needed that decouple the electrodes effectively .    fig .  [ fig3 ]",
    "shows magnetization measurements of two samples consisting of 47  nm fe@xmath0o@xmath1  / 5  nm sio@xmath2  / 40  nm ni resp .",
    "14  nm tin  / 49  nm fe@xmath0o@xmath1  / 2.5  nm al@xmath2o@xmath3  / 32  nm ni .",
    "in contrast to the samples with mgo tunnel barrier layer , these samples show a clear separated magnetization switching of the electrodes at all temperatures .",
    "the coercive field of the ni layer is slightly increased as compared to the values of the single thin reference nickel film .",
    "this effect is due to residual coupling through the thin insulating barrier . for the al@xmath2o@xmath3 barrier the switching steps are more rounded than for the case of sio@xmath2 indicating that magnetic domains do not switch simultaneously within the whole interface region .",
    "the difference between sio@xmath2 and al@xmath2o@xmath3 is that sio@xmath2 and ni is evaporated directly on top of magnetite . in the case of al@xmath2o@xmath3 ,",
    "first an al layer is deposited which is then oxidized .",
    "it is this oxidation step that also can affect the magnetite top layer leading to the observed non - ideal switching behavior .",
    "a first crucial test for the reproducibility of the tunnel barrier is the investigation of the product of junction area @xmath25 and junction resistance .",
    "we have listed in table  [ mtmr44-rf ] the measured room temperature values for a sample consisting of four contacts with different size but with the same @xmath26 nm al@xmath2o@xmath3 barrier .",
    "the four - point - resistance @xmath27 of the contacts scales inverse to their area , and the resistance - times - area - product @xmath28 of all contacts is in the same range of @xmath29 .",
    "this shows , that all contacts are approximately of the same quality , independent on their size .",
    "this implies that the insulating sio@xmath2 coating at the border of the tmr - turrets indeed suppresses leakage currents .",
    "the values obtained here for al@xmath2o@xmath3 barriers are comparable to the results of other groups .",
    "et al . _ found 1 - 230@xmath30m@xmath5 at room temperature for simple oxidized barriers and four times higher values with plasma oxidation @xcite .",
    "the junctions with the higher resistance times area product also had a significantly higher tmr effect @xcite .",
    "this shows that an optimization of the al oxidation process is a crucial step in the fabrication of a tmr device .",
    ".resistance - times - area - product of a tmr - samples having a 2.5  nm al@xmath2o@xmath3 barrier at room temperature . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     using the simmons model the @xmath31 curves could be fitted very satisfactory .",
    "the results for the effective barrier height @xmath32 and width @xmath33 after the simmons - model for the different tested barrier materials are listed in table  [ barrierentab1 ] .",
    "ndgao@xmath0 with 5ev has the highest barrier , and al@xmath2o@xmath3 with 0.7  ev the lowest barrier height at the fermi level .",
    "these values are well comparable to the results of other groups , see for example @xmath34ev for mgo @xcite .",
    "the value for the effective barrier width as obtained from the simmons fit is in most cases considerably smaller than the nominal barrier thickness .",
    "it becomes clear from table  [ barrierentab1 ] that for al@xmath2o@xmath3 barriers the fit parameter @xmath33 is closest to the nominal barrier thickness indicating that al@xmath2o@xmath3 seems to be the best material for obtaining thin and at the same time well insulating barriers . for comparison , in order to achieve comparable barrier properties using mgo a several times thicker layer has to be used .",
    "it can be assumed that the increased barrier thickness leads to increased spin scattering reducing the tmr effect .",
    "this effect is indeed observed as shown below .",
    "the reason that al@xmath2o@xmath3 is the most favorable barrier is most likely due to the fact that during electron beam evaporation first an almost complete surface wetting is achieved with elementary al .    o@xmath3 barrier .",
    "the barrier was oxidized in a 1-step process . ]      with @xmath35-measurements in 4-point - technique the tmr - effect as defined in equation  [ tmreqdef ] was determined for the different barrier materials at different temperatures between 160k and 300k : @xmath36 @xmath37 is the resistance in the anti - parallel magnetization configuration of the electrodes , which corresponds to the maximum resistance in figure [ alu - tmr ] .",
    "@xmath38 is the resistance in the parallel magnetization configuration of the electrodes , which corresponds to the minimal resistance at 0.1 tesla .    the samples with mgo and sio@xmath2 barrier exhibited only a small positive tmr - effect @xmath39  0.5% at low temperatures .",
    "samples with srtio@xmath0 and ndgao@xmath0 barrier showed nearly no tmr - effect at all . in these multilayers a small negative conventional magnetoresistance was observed as is the case for magnetite thin films .",
    "this indicates that the electrode properties dominate the measurements in these contacts .",
    "it has been shown by other groups @xcite that it is possible to obtain tmr - behavior using these barrier materials at low temperatures .",
    "but in the case of magnetite electrodes however , it is not easy to find good tmr - behavior below @xmath40 due to the strong increase of resistance .",

    "[ alu - tmr ] .",

    "that the increase of resistance for antiparallel electrode magnetization ( positive tmr - effect ) confirms the negative spin - polarisation of fe@xmath0o@xmath1 .",

    "@xmath48 is expected to be a continously decreasing function with increasing temperature .",
