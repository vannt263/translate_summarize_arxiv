    "rare earth compounds present a large variety of interesting magnetic behaviors , due to their partially filled @xmath3shells .",
    "trivalent europium compounds , in particular , offer an unique chance of observing exchange coupling between `` non - magnetic '' ions .",
    "the ground state of eu@xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) ions is @xmath6 , with a total angular moment @xmath7 resulting from both @xmath8 ( in atomic units ) , however , spin - dependent exchange effects are present .",
    "furthermore , eu ions show a substantial admixture of higher energy @xmath9 states , which contributes significantly to their susceptibility ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "eu@xmath11o@xmath12 is the prototypical compound of this family , its magnetic susceptibility has been experimentally investigated in detail@xcite . the first attempt to explain its magnetic behaviour",
    "was made by huang and van vleck@xcite , who showed that the susceptibility of eu@xmath11o@xmath12 is larger than the corresponding susceptibility of the free eu@xmath4 ion , because the energy levels of the excited @xmath13f@xmath14 states are modified by the crystal field , and pointed out the dominant contribution of the van vleck component of the susceptibility , @xmath15 .",
    "an explicit calculation of the susceptibility from energy levels obtained by optical spectroscopy measurements@xcite was performed in this work .",
    "however , the resulting @xmath10 turned out to be smaller than the experimental value , and so the remainder was attributed entirely to the exchange coupling among eu@xmath4 ions@xcite .",
    "this viewpoint has been challenged on the basis of measurements of @xmath10 in solid solutions of eu@xmath11o@xmath12 into a@xmath11o@xmath12 ( a = y , lu , sc)@xcite , where eu atoms are diluted .",
    "as the number of eu nearest neighbors is reduced , the total interatomic exchange interaction should decrease and become negligigle at small concentration of eu , and the total susceptibility should decrease along with it . the experimental susceptibility ( per mole of eu ) , however , does not decrease in the full range of investigation ( i.e. up to 10 % of eu@xmath11o@xmath12 into a@xmath11o@xmath12@xcite ) , suggesting a negligible role of the exchange interaction .",
    "this decrease of the exchange component on dilution might be due to compensation caused by change in the crystal field splitting of eu sites in a@xmath11o@xmath12 in comparison with eu@xmath11o@xmath12 ; this explanation , however , is not supported by optical measurements of the energy levels@xcite .",
    "yet another explanation has been proposed based on the distribution of eu atoms in the two available sites ( symmetry s@xmath16 and c@xmath11 ) of the cubic bixbyite structure of these oxides@xcite .",
    "the decrease of the exchange component on dilution might be compensated by a preferential occupation of the s@xmath16 site in the solid solution ; the van vleck susceptibility of this site is larger because the @xmath13f@xmath14 levels are lower in energy in comparison with the c@xmath11 site .",
    "this preferential occupation , however , was not found in x - ray diffraction@xcite , and mssbauer spectroscopic studies@xcite .",
    "a further criticism to viewpoint that the exchange coupling guides the physics of suceptibility also comes from the calculations of the van vleck susceptibility performed by caro et al.@xcite .",
    "these authors determine the crystalline field parameters starting from the experimental values of the energies of the excited states , and the matrix elements of the van vleck susceptibility were calculated using this potential and the atomic functions .",
    "the susceptibility calculated accordingly agrees well with the experimental one@xcite , validating a picture in which the exchange coupling should be negligible .",
    "we should mention here , however , that the optical data used by caro et al .",
    "have been subsequently corrected by more recent measurements@xcite .",
    "therefore , the question of whether the excess of susceptibility may be entirely attributed to the exchange coupling is still open .",
    "absence of long range magnetic order does not allow direct evaluation of the exchange coupling constants starting from experimental data and so a theoretical determination of these parameters by means of _ ab - initio _ calculations is highly desirable for understanding the behaviour of susceptibility in the material .",
    "remarkably , to the best of our knowledge , there is no experimental evidence in the literature of exchange coupling between @xmath17 ions making the `` excess '' of susceptibility of eu@xmath11o@xmath12 a novel puzzle where _ ab - initio _ calculations have the potential of providing interesting evidence towards the solution of this puzzle .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", rare earth compounds represent a challenge for modern electronic structure calculations .",
    "their multiplet structure can not be explained on the basis of a single slater determinant . the traditional density functional theory ( dft )",
    "methods with local / semi - local approximations to the exchnage correlation functionals fail to describe their correlated nature and result into a qualitatively wrong picture with flat @xmath18 bands accumulated around the fermi level ( @xmath19 ) . to overcome these problems the lda+@xmath2 , and",
    "the self - interaction corrected local density approximation ( sic - lda ) methods have been widely used in the past . focusing entirely eu@xmath4 compounds , lda+@xmath2 calculations were performed by johannes and pickett@xcite on eun and eup , and by deniszczyk__et al.__@xcite on euf@xmath1 and euco@xmath0x@xmath0 ( x = si , ge ) .",
    "sic - lda calculations were performed on several rare earth oxides by petit _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "all these works show that the correct physics in these materials can be treated within the lda+@xmath2 ( sic - lda ) method .",
    "hence in the present work we compute the electronic and magnetic structure of eu@xmath11o@xmath12 using the lda+@xmath2 approach .",
    "eu being one of the heavy rare earths , the use of an all - electron method is almost essential in the present work we emply full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) method@xcite implemented within the elk code@xcite . from the corresponding results we obtain very small values for the exchange coupling constants in cubic eu@xmath11o@xmath12 , which imply a negligible contribution of exchange to the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "for the cubic structure a * k*-point mesh of @xmath20 is used for the brillouin zone ( bz ) integration ; given the large dimension of this system ( 40 atoms per unit cell ) and the insulating character of the compound , this choice is a reasonable compromise between accuracy and computational load . for the ( smaller unit cell ) hexagonal structure , a mesh of @xmath21 is used .",

    "we obtain a theoretical upper bound for the constant to be @xmath121 mev .",
    "our results , therefore , lead to the conclusion that in cubic eu@xmath11o@xmath12 the difference between the experimental paramagnetic susceptibility and the van vleck contribution can not be due to the contribution of the exchange interaction , in contrast with conclusions of van vleck and huang@xcite .",
    "it is consistent , on the other hand , with the fact that the experimental susceptibility ( per mole of eu ) does not decrease in the solid solutions of eu@xmath0o@xmath1 into a@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the point of view of van vleck and huang has also been criticized before by caro _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite , who performed a calculation of the van vleck contribution @xmath15 including the matrix elements among atomic wavefunctions of the eu @xmath43 states .",
    "they obtained a resulting @xmath122 in good agreement with experiment , without invoking any contribution from the exchange interaction .",
    "our calculations are also consistent with these results .",
    "the investigation of the exchange interaction has also been performed for the hexagonal phase of eu@xmath11o@xmath12 under pressure . in this case , eq .",
    "[ eq:2 ] is not applicable , because the structure of the compound is not cubic ; therefore , it is not possible to determine the exchange constants by total energy differences .",
    "in contrast to the cubic phase in the case of the hexagonal structure the application of a weak magnetic field along the @xmath123 axis gives collinear spins . in the afm configuration ( described in section [ structure ] ) the cation spins have parallel orientation in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field direction ( @xmath32 axis ) , with antiparallel orientation between planes .",
    "the eu atom has three neighbors at 3.50    in the lower plane , three at 3.59    in the upper plane , and four neighbors at a distance of 3.74    in the same plane@xcite .",
    "the energy difference per eu atom is @xmath124 mev .",
    "therefore in the hexagonal structure we obtain a small but sizable afm exchange interaction between the eu ion and its six nn .",
    "interestingly the energy difference is of the same order of magnitude as that found by johannes and pickett for eun and eup@xcite .",
    "the exchange interaction is about 100 times stronger in the hexagonal phase than in the cubic one . as a first guess",
    ", one might attribute this difference to the shorter eu - eu distance in the hexagonal phase ( @xmath125 is 3.50 - 3.74    in the hexagonal phase and 3.84    in the cubic one ) . to verify this possibility , we performed test calculations in the hexagonal structure , changing the lattice constant so as to match the interatomic eu - eu distance of the cubic phase .",
    "the corresponding exchange coupling did not decrease sufficiently to support this view .",
    "the rational for the different couplings may probably be found in the different local o coordination around eu ions , as the oxygen orbitals mediate the eu - eu interaction : in the hexagonal structure there are two o atoms binding two nn eu ions , while there is only one intermediate o atom in the cubic one .",
    "an analysis of the partial densities of states in the two structures supports this view , with a quite large hybridization of eu @xmath43 and o orbitals in the hexagonal phase .",
    "interestingly we also observe that the phase with stronger exchange coupling has a collinear spin structure , while the structure with weaker interaction is characterized by non - collinear spins .",
    "in conclusion , we studied the electronic structure of cubic bixbyte eu@xmath0o@xmath1 and its high pressure hexagonal phase by mean of full potential linearized augmented plane wave calculations , within the lda+@xmath2 method . in both phases the filled o @xmath51 and empty majority spin eu @xmath43 states are separated by a @xmath126 ev gap , while minority eu @xmath43 states start around 4 ev above @xmath19 , in agreement with the optical and transport measurements@xcite .    from the comparison of fm and afm calculations",
    "we infer that the interatomic exchange interaction is negligible in cubic eu@xmath11o@xmath12 , and so is its effect on the susceptibility .",
    "this is consistent with the experimental observation of a constant susceptibility ( per mole of eu ) of solid solutions of eu@xmath0o@xmath1 into a@xmath0o@xmath1 ( a = y , lu , sc ) .",
    "our calculations are in contrast with the point of view of van vleck and huang@xcite , according to which exchange is needed to explain the behavior of the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "our results are consistent with later calculations@xcite which could explain the experimental susceptibility by including matrix element in the van vleck contribution . in the hexagonal phase we observe the presence of a small but sizable afm exchange interaction between the eu ion and its six nearest neighbors .",
    "therefore , in this phase we could have a non negligible contribution of exchange to the magnetic susceptibility , but for now no experimental measurements are available for comparison .",
