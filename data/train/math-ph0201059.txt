    "quantization is a procedure for replacing functions on the phase space of a physical system ( classical observables ) by linear operators .",
    "while understood in many general situations , this procedure is far from being algorithmic .",
    "some more exotic spaces whose quantizations are of interest to mathematicians are the moduli spaces of flat connections on a surface . among them",
    "the case of the moduli space of flat @xmath0-connections on a torus is a particularly simple example of an algebraic variety that fails to be a manifold , yet is very close to being one .    in this paper",
    "we compare two methods of quantizing the moduli space of flat @xmath0-connections on the torus .",
    "the first is the quantization using the quantum group of @xmath1 .",
    "this quantization scheme arose when reshetikhin and turaev constructed a topological quantum field theory that explains the jones polynomial of a knot .",
    "it describes both the quantum observables and the hilbert spaces in terms of knots and links colored by representations of the quantum group of @xmath1 .",
    "heuristically , the operators of the quantization were defined by witten using path integrals for the chern - simons action .    on the other hand ,",
    "the moduli space of flat @xmath0-connections on the torus is the same as the character variety of @xmath0-representations of its fundamental group , so it admits a covering by the plane .",
    "therefore we can apply a classical quantization procedure of the plane in an equivariant manner to obtain a quantization of the moduli space .",
    "the first such procedure was introduced by hermann weyl .",
    "it assigns to each smooth function ( classical observable ) on the plane the pseudo - differential operator with symbol equal to the function .",
    "our main result is the following    * theorem . * _ the weyl quantization and the quantum group quantization of the moduli space of flat @xmath0-connections on the torus are unitarily equivalent .",
    "_    the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the geometric realization and the khler structure of the moduli space of flat @xmath0-connections on the torus . in section 3",
    "we review witten s description of the quantization for the particular case of the torus with a path integral of the chern - simons action , then explain the rigorous construction of reshetikhin and turaev using quantum groups . here",
    "we also mention a result of the first author that describes the matrices of the operators associated to cosine functions in a distinguished basis of the hilbert space .",
    "this distinguished basis consists of the colorings of the core of the solid torus by irreducible representations .",
    "we then explain in detail the weyl quantization of the moduli space ( section [ patru ] ) .",
    "this is done in the holomorphic setting , which can be related to the classical , real setting through the bargman transform .",
    "a distinguished basis of the hilbert space is introduced in terms of odd theta functions .",
    "section 5 contains the main result of the paper ( theorem 5.3 ) .",
    "it shows that the two quantizations are unitarily equivalent .",
    "the unitary equivalence maps the basis consisting of odd theta functions to the basis consisting of the colored cores of the solid torus . in section 6",
    "we discuss the @xmath2-product that arises from this quantization .",
    "we conclude with some final remarks about the quantization scheme based on the kauffman bracket skein module , for which the result does not hold due to a sign obstruction .",
    "throughout the paper @xmath3 will denote the 2-dimensional torus .",
    "the moduli space of flat @xmath0-connections on a surface is the same as the character variety of @xmath0-representations of the fundamental group of the surface @xcite , i.e. the set of the morphisms of the fundamental group of the surface into @xmath0 modulo conjugation .",
    "this is a complex algebraic variety . in the case of the torus",
    ", morphisms from @xmath4 to @xmath0 are parameterized by the images of the two generators of @xmath5 , i.e. by two commuting matrices .",
    "the two matrices can be simultaneously diagonalized .",
    "moreover conjugation can permute simultaneously the entries in the two diagonal matrices .",
    "therefore the character variety is @xmath6 this set is called the `` pillow case '' .",
    "it has a 2 - 1 covering by the torus , with branching points @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "we will think of the character variety as the quotient of the complex plane by the group @xmath11 generated by the translations @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and by the symmetry with respect to the origin , which we denote by @xmath14 .    off",
    "the four singularities @xmath15 is a khler manifold , with khler form @xmath16 induced by @xmath17 on @xmath18 .",
    "note that @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the weight of the bargman measure on the plane .",
    "also , note that the khler form @xmath16 is the genus one case of goldman s symplectic form defined in @xcite .",
    "the classical observables are the @xmath21 functions on this variety . using the covering map we identify the algebra of observables on the character variety with the algebra of functions on @xmath22 generated by @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "another family of important functions on the character variety are @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are coprime . as functions on the moduli space ,",
    "these associate to a connection the trace in the @xmath28-dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath0 of the holonomy of the connection around the curve of slope @xmath29 on the torus .    to quantize @xmath15 means to replace classical observables @xmath30 by linear operators @xmath31 on some hilbert space , satisfying dirac s conditions :    * @xmath32 , * @xmath33+o(\\hbar)$ ] .",

    "the phase space is an orbifold covered by the plane , and this orbifold is khler off singularities , it is natural to perform equivariant quantization of the plane .",
    "we do this using weyl s method and then compare the result with the quantization from @xcite which was done using the quantum group of @xmath1 .",
    "the quantization of the moduli space of flat @xmath0-connections on a surface performed using the quantum group of @xmath1 at roots of unity is an offspring of reshetikhin and turaev s construction of quantum invariants of 3-manifolds @xcite .",
    "their work was inspired by witten s heuristic explanation of the jones polynomial using chern - simons topological quantum field theory .",
    "we present below witten s idea for the particular case of the torus , and then show how the reshetikhin - turaev construction yields a quantization of @xmath15 .      in @xcite ,",
    "witten outlined a way of quantizing the moduli space of flat connections on a trivial principal bundle with gauge group a simply connected compact lie group .",
    "let us recall how this is done when the group is @xmath0 and the principal bundle lies over the cylinder over the torus @xmath38 $ ] .    for @xmath39 an @xmath0-connection on @xmath40 define the chern - simons lagrangian to be @xmath41 where tr is the trace on the 2-dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath42 .",
    "the lagrangian is invariant under gauge transformations up to the addition of an integer .",
    "the fields we quantize are the flat connections on @xmath3 , and symplectic reduction restricts our attention to the moduli space of flat connections @xcite , hence to the character variety .",
    "now , using witten s idea we will associate operators to the observables of the form @xmath43 and @xmath25 on the torus @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath45 be some fixed integer called the level of the quantization .",
    "as such , planck s constant is @xmath46 .",

    "consider the cylinder over the torus @xmath49 $ ] and let @xmath50 be the curve of slope @xmath51 in @xmath52 .",
    "then the operator associated by the quantization to the function @xmath53 and denoted shortly by @xmath54 ( @xmath55 from sine ) is determined by the following path integral @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 are conjugacy classes of flat connections on @xmath3 , @xmath39 is a connection on @xmath49 $ ] such that @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , known as the wilson line , is the trace of the @xmath28-dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath0 evaluated on the holonomy of @xmath39 around @xmath50 of slope @xmath51 . here",
    "the `` average '' is taken over all conjugacy classes of connections modulo the gauge group .    with the same notations one defines the operator @xmath62 ( @xmath50 from cosine ) representing the quantization of the function @xmath63 by @xmath64",

    "next section will make these ideas precise .",
    "the hilbert space is spanned by the quantum invariants ( i.e. partition functions ) of all 3-manifolds with boundary equal to the torus .",
    "since any 3-manifold can be obtained by performing surgery on a link that lies in the solid torus , it follows that the hilbert space of the quantization is spanned by the partition functions of pairs of the form @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is a ( colored ) link in the solid torus @xmath67 .",
    "the quantization of the character variety of the torus using the quantum group of @xmath1 is a particular consequence of the topological quantum field theory constructed in @xcite .",

    "there is a rule , for which we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite , for associating numerical invariants to colored links in the 3-sphere .",
    "briefly , the idea is to use a link diagram such as the one in fig .",
