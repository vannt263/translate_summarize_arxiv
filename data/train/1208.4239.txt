    "( @xmath2 , steric repulsion and other short - range interactions ( e.g. , lubrication forces , flagellar bundling of neighboring cells ) can be expected to govern physical reorientation and alignment , whereas intrinsic brownian motion effects  @xcite become less important in this collision - dominated high - density regime  @xcite .",
    "chemotaxis  @xcite can strongly affect bacterial dynamics in droplets or near liquid - gas interfaces , but is less relevant in closed chambers as considered in our experiments .",
    "recent direct measurements of individual _ escherichia coli _ flow fields  @xcite suggest that hydrodynamic far - field interactions are negligible for bacterial reorientation , especially when bacteria swim close to a no - slip surface .",
    "earlier experiments   @xcite on 2d films and 3d bulk suspensions also show that the average swimming speeds of individual bacteria ( typically of the order of @xmath3 m/s in isolation  @xcite ) can be enhanced up to five times through collective hydrodynamic near - field effects . in the simplest approximation ,",
    "however , a sufficiently dense bacterial suspension can be viewed as a system of deterministic , self - propelled , rod - like particles with an effective swimming speed  @xmath4 ( for _ b. subtilis _ at @xmath5 we find @xmath6 to @xmath7 m/s depending on oxygen concentration and boundary conditions ) .",
    "one of our objectives is to test such a minimal model against experiments in the limit of highly concentrated suspensions and to provide systematic guidance for more accurate future models .      to identify generic requirements for the formation of turbulent phases in active systems , we performed simulations of a minimal 2d spr model with periodic boundary conditions ( see si appendix for details ) . in its simplest form , the model assumes that a rod - shaped self - propelled particle moves deterministically in the overdamped low - re regime with an effective swimming speed  @xmath4 , while interacting with the other particles by steric forces .",
    "mutual repulsion is implemented by discretizing each rod into spherical segments and imposing a repulsive yukawa force potential @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the distance , between the segments of any two rods ( i.e. , the decay length @xmath10 defines the effective diameter of a rod of length @xmath11 ) .",
    "if two sufficiently long rods perform a pair - collision , this short - range interaction results in an effective nematic ( apolar ) alignment , before the rods become pushed apart by the repulsive force .    depending on the effective volume filling fraction @xmath12 and the rod aspect ratio  @xmath13 , both defined in terms of the scale parameter @xmath14 and rod length @xmath11 , the spr model exhibits a range of qualitatively different dynamical phases ( fig .",
    "[ nephase ] ) . the numerically estimated non - equilibrium phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ nephase]a ) illustrates the importance of the effective particle shapein 2d : upon increasing  @xmath12 , short rods undergo a transition from a dilute state  ( d ) , with little or no cooperative motion , to a jammed state ( j ) ; this transition can be identified by the mean square displacement per particle , which drops off nearly two orders in magnitude along the transition curve . by contrast",
    ", very long rods ( @xmath15 ) do not jam at moderate filling fractions but exhibit swarming ( s ) behavior and large spatiotemporal density fluctuations .",
    "generally , the transitions from the dilute phase ( d ) to cooperative motion ( regions s , b and t ) can be characterized by the onsager overlap density  @xcite . upon increasing @xmath12",
    "further , very long rods tend to assemble in homogeneous lanes  ( l ) , corresponding to quasi - smectic regions of local polar order ; the swarming - to - laning transition is signaled by a discontinuous increase in the correlation length of the two - particle velocity correlation function .",
    "the swarming ( s ) and laning ( l ) phases adjoin a so - called active bionematic  @xcite phase ( b ) , where vortices and extended jet - like structures coexist @xcite ; this phase is characterized by large fluctuations of the local vortex density .",
    "most importantly for the present study , however , the spr model predicts homogeneous turbulent states ( t ) at high filling fractions and intermediate aspect ratios @xmath16 , a range that covers typical bacterial values ( e.g. , @xmath17 for _ e. coli _ and @xmath18 for _ b. subtilis _ ( si appendix , fig .",
    "the transition between bionematic and turbulent phase is also signaled by the velocity distribution , correlation functions and density fluctuations ( si appendix , fig .",

    "the mean enstrophy @xmath26 exhibits a maximum when plotted versus the volume fraction  @xmath12 ( fig .",

    "this maximum coincides approximately with the transition from the bionematic to the turbulent phase ; in a bacterial suspension , it corresponds to the optimal concentration for fluid mixing . typical aspect ratios of bacterial cell bodies in our experiments lie in the range @xmath18 ( mean @xmath27 ; see si appendix , fig .",

    "in contrast to recent investigations of bacterial dynamics in 2d free - standing films  @xcite , on 2d surfaces  @xcite and open 3d bulk suspensions  @xcite , bacteria were confined in closed microfluidic chambers to minimize oxygen gradients that may cause anisotropic streaming of the oxytactic  _ b.  subtilis _ bacteria  @xcite . to study the effects of dimensionality and boundary conditions ,",

    "the dynamics of @xmath34 is governed by an incompressible toner - tu equation  @xcite , supplemented with a swift - hohenberg - type fourth - order term  @xcite , @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes pressure , and general hydrodynamic considerations  @xcite suggest that @xmath37 for pusher - swimmers like _ b. subtilis _ ( see si appendix ) . the @xmath38-terms in eq .",

    "is damped to a globally disordered state with @xmath41 , whereas for @xmath42 a global polar ordering is induced .",
    "however , such global polar ordering is not observed in suspensions of swimming bacteria , suggesting that other instability mechanisms prevail  @xcite . a detailed stability analysis ( si appendix ) of eq .",
    "implies that the swift - hohenberg - type @xmath43-terms provide the simplest generic description of self - sustained meso - scale turbulence in incompressible active flow : for @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the model exhibits a range of unstable modes , resulting in turbulent states as shown in fig .",

    "the maxima of the even transverse structure @xmath54 signal a typical vortex size @xmath55 , which is substantially larger in 3d bulk flow than in quasi-2d bacterial flow . unlike their counterparts in high - re navier - stokes flow  @xcite , the structure functions of active turbulence exhibit only a small region of power law growth for @xmath56 and flatten at larger distances ( fig .",

    "we observe turbulent vortices on scales @xmath67 , which formally correspond to the energy - inertial range @xmath68 in classical 2d turbulence  @xcite .",
    "our experimental and numerical data suggest asymptotic power law scaling regimes for small and large @xmath69-values ( see fig .  [",
    "f : spectrum]b ) , but the power - law exponents differ from the characteristic @xmath70-decay of 2d kolmogorov - kraichnan turbulence  @xcite ; see discussion below .",
    "the spectra for the 2d continuum model and the quasi-2d bacteria experiments are in good agreement , both showing large-@xmath69 scaling with approximately @xmath71 and small-@xmath69 scaling with roughly @xmath72 . the asymptotic spectra for the 2d spr model and the 3d experimental data look qualitatively similar , but do also exhibit an intermediate plateau region which indicates that kinetic energy is more evenly distributed over a range of scales .",
    "the deterministic spr model provides a simplified description of the bacterial dynamics , as it neglects not only elastic properties of flagella and cell body , but also hydrodynamic interactions and orientational fluctuations due to intrinsic swimming variability and thermal effects  @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding , at high concentrations , such a minimal model reproduces remarkably well the flow velocity distributions and the structure functions from our quasi-2d  _ b. subtilis _ experiments and the 2d continuum simulations  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sf ] ) .",
    "this implies that hydrodynamic interactions _ per se _ are not required for the formation of self - sustained turbulence in dense suspensions  self - propulsion , a rod - like shape and volume exclusion interactions are sufficient ( this raises the question whether the optimization of collective behavior may have been a factor in the evolution of bacterial shapes ) .",
    "however , to achieve a better quantitative agreement , particle - based future studies should focus on more realistic models that account for hydrodynamic near - field interactions and intrinsic randomness in bacterial swimming  @xcite .",
    "the experimental results presented above provide a benchmark for evaluating such microscopic models  @xcite .",
    "the good agreement of the structure functions , spatial and temporal flow correlations ( see also fig .",
    "s9 ) , and spectra from the 2d continuum theory with those from the quasi-2d experiments suggests that this theory could be a viable model for dense suspensions .",
    "since the instability mechanism in the continuum theory arises from a generic small - wave number expansion in fourier - space ( see si appendix ) , that is analogous to the landau - expansion in order - parameter space for second - order phase - transitions , we expect that the model applies to a wide range of quasi - incompressible active fluids .",
    "this would imply that meso - scale turbulent structures in these systems share universallong - wave length characteristics .",
    "we note that the theory as formulated in eq .   only accounts for leading terms up to fourth - order and , therefore , becomes inaccurate for large velocities and wave numbers ( see tails in figs .",
    "3a , b and 4b ) . nevertheless , this continuum model appears to capture the main statistical and dynamical features of the experimental data .",
    "important future challenges include the analytical prediction of active flow spectra from eq .  , detailed numerical studies of 3d bacterial bulk flows , and comparisons of our experimental and numerical data with @xmath73-tensor models and other multi - order parameter theories  @xcite .      the quasi-2d experiments allow us to compare with 2d simulations that come close to experimental system sizes .",
    "free - standing thin films  @xcite and bacterial mono - layers on open surfaces  @xcite , which may be more prone to intrinsic instabilities and external fluctuations , provide an alternative , but non - equivalent realization of a 2d bacterial fluid .",
    "the crucial difference between freestanding 2d films and our closed quasi-2d set - up is that the presence of no - slip boundaries in our experiments suppresses hydrodynamic long - range interactions between bacteria due to cancellation effects from the hydrodynamic images : an isolated dipole - like swimmer ( as _ e. coli _",
    "@xcite and , most likely , _ b. subtilis _ ) creates a stroke - averaged far - field flow that decays as @xmath74 with distance @xmath9 in a 3d fluid .",
    "when the same swimmer moves parallel to a nearby solid surface in an otherwise semi - infinite fluid , the flow components parallel to the boundary decay faster @xmath75  @xcite .",
    "if , however , the swimmer is closely confined between two parallel no - slip walls , as in our quasi-2d experiments with @xmath76 m , then the flow field becomes exponentially damped at distances @xmath77  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , in free - standing 2d films the flow field generated by an isolated microorganism has a much longer range  @xmath78  @xcite , suggesting that hydrodynamic interactions could play a more important role for collective behavior in these systems  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the typical vortex size in 3d is larger than in quasi-2d could indicate stronger short - to - intermediate - distance hydrodynamic coupling in 3d bulk flow ; it would therefore be interesting to perform a similar analysis for thin - film data  @xcite .",
    "generally , however , we expect hydrodynamic far - field interactions to be less important for the dynamics in very dense suspensions due to mutual hydrodynamic screening  @xcite and the small magnitude of bacterial flows fields  @xcite , but they could act as a destabilizing noise  @xcite .",
    "conventional high - re turbulence arises from energy input on large scales ( e.g. , stirring or shearing ) . in 3d",
    "flow the injected energy is redistributed to smaller scales via an energy - inertial downward cascade with @xmath79  @xcite . in 2d films , due to the suppression of vortex stretching  @xcite",
    ", there can be both an energy - inertial upward cascade with @xmath80 and an enstrophy - transfer downward cascade with @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , viscoelastic polymer solutions can exhibit turbulent features ( e.g. , spectral power law scaling ) at reynolds numbers as low as @xmath82 , facilitated by a slow nonlinear response to external shear due to long intrinsic relaxation times of the polymers  @xcite .",
    "our simulations and experiments suggest asymptotic spectral power law decays towards the bacterial energy injection scale @xmath66 that resemble the energy - inertial regime of classical turbulence but , due to viscous damping by the low - re solvent , extend over a smaller range of length scales ( roughly up to @xmath83 ) .",
    "the latter fact is reminiscent of viscoelastic turbulence  @xcite , although the underlying physical mechanisms are very different .    in conclusion , bacterial or , more generally , self - sustained active turbulence ,  shares some qualitative characteristics with classical turbulence on small scales while differing on larger scales .",
    "our detailed statistical analysis shows that , as with inertial turbulence , a complete quantitative understanding of turbulent behavior in active systems poses a challenging task .",
    "the combined experimental , theoretical and numerical results presented here may provide both qualitative and quantitative guidance for future studies that aim at identifying the basic principles of dynamical self - organization in living fluids .",
