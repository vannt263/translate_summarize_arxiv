    "according to the current unification paradigm of seyfert galaxies the most numerous class of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in the local universe , the two types of seyfert galaxies , type 1 ( which show broad optical emission lines ) and type 2 ( which do not ) , are both powered by a central mass - accreting supermassive black hole .",
    "the different emission properties are explained by the presence of a torus - shaped structure of molecular gas and dust surrounding the central supermassive black hole ( the so - called `` dusty torus '' ) and the different viewing angles toward the torus @xcite . since the dusty torus is rich in molecular gas , it is a natural site for starbursts to occur @xcite .",
    "such a nuclear starburst in the torus could play an important role for agn physics @xcite , so that its observational understanding is very important .",
    "attempts to put observational constraints on the nuclear starbursts in the torus in seyfert 2 galaxies have been made extensively , from uv  optical ( e.g. , gonzalez delgado et al .",
    "1998 ) , through infrared ( e.g. , oliva et al . 1999 ; ivanov et al .",
    "2000 ; imanishi 2002 ; 2003 ) , to millimeter wavelength ranges @xcite . among these methods ,",
    "infrared diagnostics have two major advantages .",
    "first , since nuclear starbursts in the torus are expected to have some amount of dust extinction , infrared observations are better suited to investigate their properties than those in the uv or optical , because of the reduced effects of dust extinction in the infrared .",
    "second , compared to millimeter observations , a systematic study of the nuclear starbursts in a statistically meaningful number of seyfert 2s is possible with a reasonable amount of telescope time .",
    "@xcite obtained infrared @xmath3-band ( 2.84.1 @xmath1 m ) slit spectra of 32 seyfert 2s in the cfa @xcite and 12 @xmath1 m ( rush , malkan , & spinoglio 1993 ) samples . utilizing the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission feature at 3.3 @xmath1 m as an excellent tool to disentangle star - formation from agn activity @xcite , the author discussed the properties of nuclear starbursts in seyfert 2s in a quantitative manner .",
    "nuclear starbursts in seyfert 2s can also be investigated through infrared @xmath0-band ( 2.02.5 @xmath1 m ) spectroscopy .",
    "since the co absorption features at @xmath4 = 2.32.4 @xmath1 m in the rest - frame are produced by stars , and not by a pure agn , these features can be a good tool to distinguish between stars and an agn @xcite . among the 32 seyfert 2s studied by @xcite ,",
    "25 sources were observed with spex at the irtf 3 m telescope @xcite ( see table 2 of imanishi 2003 ) .",
    "since spex enables to obtain @xmath0- and @xmath3-band spectra simultaneously , the stellar emission in seyfert 2 nuclei can be investigated also from the @xmath0-band co absorption features , independently from the @xmath3-band pah diagnostic . in this paper , we present @xmath0-band spectroscopic results and combine them with the @xmath3-band results to provide a better understanding of seyfert 2 nuclei .",
    "@xmath5 @xmath6 75 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 , @xmath8 = 0.3 , and @xmath9 = 0.7 are adopted throughout this paper .",
    "detailed information and the observing log of the 25 seyfert 2s are summarized in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the original sample selection criteria and observing details are found in @xcite . in short , seyfert 2s in the cfa and 12 @xmath1 m samples at @xmath10 = 0.0080.035 and at declination @xmath11 @xmath1235@xmath13 were selected .",
    "the cfa and 12 @xmath1 m seyfert 2 galaxies were selected based on their host galaxy magnitudes in the optical @xcite and _ iras _",
    "12 @xmath1 m fluxes @xcite , respectively .",
    "the observations were made with spex at the irtf 3 m telescope , using the 1.94.2 @xmath1 m cross - dispersed mode with a 1@xmath146 wide slit @xcite , which provides a spectral resolution of r @xmath15 500 in the @xmath0-band .",
    "the 1@xmath146 aperture used corresponds to physical scales of between 250 pc ( @xmath10 = 0.008 ) and 1 kpc ( @xmath10 = 0.035 ) , so our spectra are suitable to investigate the _ nuclear _ starbursts , rather than ring - shaped _ circumnuclear _ starbursts which are found typically at distances of @xmath151 kpc from the nuclei @xcite .",
    "the sky was clear and the seeing at @xmath0 was 0@xmath1460@xmath149 ( full - width at half - maximum ; fwhm ) throughout the observations .",
    "the data reduction of the @xmath0-band spectra was made using iraf in the same way as the @xmath3-band data , as described by @xcite .",
    "the seyfert 2 and standard star spectra were extracted by integrating signals over 1@xmath1483@xmath140 along the slit , depending on the actual signal profiles .",
    "the @xmath0-band magnitudes of the standard stars in table  [ tbl-1 ] were estimated from their @xmath16-band ( 0.6 @xmath1 m ) magnitudes , adopting @xmath17 colors appropriate to the stellar types of individual standard stars @xcite .",
    "the seyfert 2 spectra were divided by those of the corresponding standard stars , and then multiplied by the spectra of blackbodies with temperatures corresponding to those of the individual standard stars ( table  [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "appropriate spectral binning was employed , particularly for faint sources .",
    "the intrinsic co absorption of the adopted standard stars ( a- , f- , g - type main sequence stars ) is too weak @xcite to affect our main conclusions about the co absorption strength of the seyfert 2 nuclei .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the flux - calibrated @xmath0-band slit spectra of the 25 seyfert 2s in our sample .",
    "some sources showed a larger scatter in the spectra over the @xmath18 = 2.002.02 @xmath1 m and 2.052.07 @xmath1 m range in the observed frame than their neighboring wavelengths , due to the presence of the earth s atmospheric absorption features . since these data points may have bad effects on the continuum determination , with which to estimate the strength of the co absorption features , we only used spectra at @xmath18 = 2.072.5 @xmath1 m .",
    "for some of the seyfert 2 galaxies in our sample , spectra with a smaller wavelength coverage , in the close vicinity of the br@xmath19 emission line at @xmath4 = 2.166 @xmath1 m , are available @xcite .",
    "for all the cfa seyfert 2s in our sample except ngc 4501 and ngc 5347 , @xcite presented moderate - resolution ( r @xmath15 700 ) spectra at @xmath4 = 2.02.4 @xmath1 m and/or higher - resolution ( r @xmath11 1000 ) spectra in narrower wavelength ranges near the co absorption features .",
    "however , for the majority of the 25 seyfert 2s , our spectra in figure  [ fig1 ] are the first moderate - resolution spectra with an almost complete @xmath0-band coverage .",
    "thus , a systematic and consistent investigation of the co absorption features in a statistically larger number of seyfert 2s is possible .    to investigate the presence of nuclear starbursts in seyfert 2s using the strength of the co absorption features",
    ", we basically follow the method proposed by doyon , joseph , & wright ( 1994 ) , who defined a spectroscopic co index as @xmath20 where @xmath21r@xmath22@xmath11 is the average of actual signals at @xmath4 = 2.312.40 @xmath1 m divided by a power - law continuum ( f@xmath23 = @xmath24 ) extrapolated from shorter wavelengths . when the co absorption is present , @xmath21r@xmath22@xmath11 should be less than unity and thus the co@xmath25 should show a positive value .",
    "this co index is insensitive to spectral resolution , because an average value within the wavelengths that show co absorption is used .",
    "thus , this index can be directly compared among independent spectra observed with slightly different resolutions .    to determine the continuum level , @xcite used data points at @xmath4 = 2.02.29 @xmath1 m , excluding clear emission lines , and extrapolated it to @xmath4 @xmath11 2.31 @xmath1 m . in our sample , the redshifts are in the range @xmath26 0.0080.035 and only data points at wavelengths @xmath18 = 2.072.5 @xmath1 m are available .",
    "thus , data points at wavelengths as short as @xmath4 = 2.0 @xmath1 m are not fully covered .",
    "we thus used data points at @xmath4 = 2.12.29 @xmath1 m to determine the continuum level and extrapolated it to longer wavelengths . following @xcite ,",
    "a power - law shape was assumed for the continuum and clear emission lines , such as h@xmath27 10 s(1 ) ( @xmath4 = 2.122 @xmath1 m ) or br@xmath19 ( @xmath4 = 2.166 @xmath1 m ) , were excluded . regarding the wavelength range that should contain the co absorption features , our spectra of @xmath18 = 2.072.5 @xmath1 m covers @xmath4 = 2.312.4 @xmath1 m for all the observed seyfert 2s at @xmath26 0.0080.035 , so that the same wavelength range of @xmath4 = 2.312.4 @xmath1 m as employed by @xcite was adopted to measure the co absorption strength .",
    "although the wavelength range used for the continuum determination is slightly different , our spectroscopic co index is essentially the same as that defined by @xcite .",
    "whenever possible , we tried to use this method to determine the continuum level in a consistent way .",
    "however , in the case of ngc 262 and f04385@xmath120828 , the extrapolated continuum determined in this way provided a negative value for co@xmath25 , possibly because of the curvature of the continuum emission at @xmath4 = 2.12.29 @xmath1 m . in these two sources",
    ", we used only data at @xmath4 = 2.222.29 @xmath1 m and 2.182.29 @xmath1 m , respectively , which provided more reasonable extrapolated continuum levels at @xmath4 = 2.312.40 @xmath1 m .",
    "the adopted continuum levels are plotted as solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the values and histogram of the observed spectroscopic co indices ( co@xmath28 ) are summarized in column 2 of table  [ tbl-2 ] and figure 2a , respectively .",
    "the largest uncertainty of the co@xmath28 values comes from the ambiguity of the continuum determination , which is difficult to assess quantitatively . for some seyfert 2s , we slightly changed the wavelength range used for the continuum determination as well as the removed data points which may be contaminated by emission lines .",
    "the co@xmath28 value differs by a factor of as high as 0.03 , which can be taken as a possible maximum uncertainty for co@xmath28 .    for the majority of the cfa seyfert 2s , @xcite estimated spectroscopic co indices based on independent data .",
    "they used a very narrow wavelength range of @xmath4 = 2.285@xmath290.005 @xmath1 m and 2.298@xmath290.005 @xmath1 m for the continuum and the data points which include co absorption features , respectively . if this method were to be applied to our lower resolution spectra",
    ", the resulting uncertainty for co@xmath28 would be large , because only one or two data points would be included in each of these wavelength ranges . in table",
    "[ tbl-2 ] we compare the observed spectroscopic co indices based on our wider wavelength coverage spectra , with the indices derived by @xcite . for some sources ( ngc 5929 , ngc 7674 , and ngc 7682 ) ,",
    "both co index measurements are in good agreement , but there is some discrepancy for other sources , possibly because of the different method to derive co@xmath28 and/or different aperture size .    in some objects , narrow ( @xmath21500 km s@xmath7 in fwhm ) emission lines are discernible in the spectra . in fig.1 , we indicate the identification of some clear emission lines",
    ". in general , their equivalent widths are smaller than in starburst galaxies @xcite . to quantitatively estimate these weak and narrow emission line fluxes , by tracing the line profiles , spectra with r @xmath11 1000 are usually required .",
    "no quantitative estimates for the line fluxes are made based on our lower resolution ( r @xmath15 500 ) spectra .",
    "unlike pure star - forming galaxies , a featureless continuum from hot dust heated by an agn can contribute significantly to the observed @xmath0-band fluxes in seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "this contribution reduces the depth of the co absorption feature ; the degree of this reduction can vary , depending on the amount of agn emission in the @xmath0-band .",
    "indeed , the co@xmath28 values of a large fraction of the observed seyfert 2 galaxies in fig.2a are substantially smaller than the typical values observed in star - forming or elliptical ( = spheroidal ) galaxies ( co@xmath25 @xmath11 0.15 ; goldader et al .",
    "1997a , b ; ivanov et al .",
    "this is likely to be caused by dilution of the co absorption feature by the agn s featureless continuum emission .    in the @xmath3-band",
    ", the emission from stars is much reduced when compared to that in the @xmath0-band , whereas hot ( @xmath151000k ) dust heated by an agn has strong emission both at @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the relative contribution from the agn to the nuclear spectra increases substantially from @xmath0 to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in fact , the typical @xmath30 color of an agn is usually larger ( redder ) than a normal stellar population @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 colors can be used to estimate the agn contribution to the nuclear @xmath0-band spectra .",
    "the nuclear @xmath2 colors , derived from our slit spectra , are summarized in column 5 of table 2 .",
    "figure 3a compares the nuclear @xmath2 colors with the co@xmath28 values .",
    "the @xmath2 color and co@xmath28 are anti - correlated in such a way that objects with redder @xmath2 colors tend to show smaller co@xmath28 .",
    "the probability that a correlation is not present is found to be 0.01% @xcite . since the observed @xmath2 colors should become redder , when compared to those of a normal stellar population , for an increasing contribution from the agn , the anti - correlation in fig.3a suggests that the smaller co@xmath28 values in objects with redder @xmath2 colors are caused by the agn contribution .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that to investigate the stellar emission from the co absorption features in more detail , a correction for the agn dilution is necessary . to make this correction quantitatively , we make use of the rest - frame equivalent width of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission feature ( ew@xmath31 ) .",
    "the ew@xmath31 values are summarized in column 6 of table 2 .",
    "hot dust heated by an agn produces a featureless @xmath3-band continuum , while star - forming galaxies usually show strong 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission with ew@xmath31 @xmath15 100 nm @xcite .",
    "since the equivalent width is by definition robust to dust extinction , we assume that pure star - formation shows ew@xmath31 = 100 nm , while a pure agn shows ew@xmath31 = 0 nm .",
    "for the three seyfert 2s with ew@xmath31 values @xmath1140 nm ( ngc 7682 , mrk 938 , and ngc 3660 ; imanishi 2003 ) , a significant contribution from star - formation to the @xmath3-band fluxes must be present .",
    "for these sources , we estimate the fractional stellar contribution at @xmath3 , based on the observed ew@xmath31 values . more specifically ,",
    "if the observed ew@xmath31 value is 70 nm , we regard that 70% of the observed @xmath3-band flux comes from star - formation , and the remaining 30% originates in agn emission .",
    "we then extract @xmath3-band fluxes originated in agn activity from the observed @xmath3-band flux levels . for the seyfert 2s with very small ew@xmath31 of @xmath32 20 nm ( 22 sources except ngc 7682 , mrk 938 , and ngc 3660 ) , we regard the observed @xmath3-band fluxes as dominated by agn - powered emission @xcite .",
    "namely , the observed @xmath3-band fluxes are taken as agn - originated @xmath3-band fluxes .    to derive the agn fraction in the @xmath0-band spectra from the estimated agn - powered @xmath3-band flux levels",
    ", we assume that the intrinsic agn colors in all seyfert 2 galaxies are @xmath2 = 2.79 , as was done by @xcite . @xcite",
    "have shown that the infrared agn spectral energy distributions in seyfert 2 galaxies are fitted with f@xmath33",
    "@xmath34 @xmath35 , which provides @xmath2 @xmath15 2.52.6 .",
    "thus , the adopted assumption of @xmath2 = 2.79 is reasonably justified from the observational point of view . after subtracting this agn emission from the observed @xmath0-band spectra",
    ", we can infer the stellar @xmath0-band emission and thereby obtain corrected co indices ( co@xmath36 ) .",
    "the derived stellar @xmath0-band luminosities are summarized in column 7 of table 2 . regarding the corrected co index ( co@xmath36 ) , if the agn contribution to the observed @xmath0-band flux is estimated to be 60% , then the co absorption optical depth increases by 2.5 \\{=1/(1@xmath120.6 ) } , and the spectroscopic co index increases accordingly .",
    "thus , when the observed co index is very small , say co@xmath28 @xmath21 0.1 , due to dilution from agn emission at @xmath0 , a small uncertainty in the continuum determination can result in a large ambiguity in the corrected co index .",
    "there are 10 sources with co@xmath28 @xmath11 0.1 .",
    "we regard the co absorption as clearly detected in these 10 sources , and estimate co@xmath36 only for them , in order for the correction process to work reasonably .",
    "the co@xmath36 values of the 10 sources are summarized in column 3 of table 2 , and the histogram of the co indices corrected in this way is plotted in figure 2b .",
    "although the agn correction certainly increases the co indices , the change of their overall distribution is little .",
    "thus , possible ambiguities of this agn correction do not seriously affect our main conclusions .",
    "this method to correct the co indices for agn emission using our own slit spectra has important advantages over some other methods , such as that based on nuclear @xmath0- and @xmath3-band photometric data .",
    "first , since the @xmath0- and @xmath3-band spectra were taken simultaneously under the same observing conditions and probe the same regions in the observed seyfert 2 galaxies , there is little ambiguity on the flux inter - calibration .",
    "second , the compact nuclear @xmath3-band emission observed in seyferts is usually assumed to be dominated by agn emission @xcite .",
    "although this is true for the majority of seyfert 2s @xcite , there are some exceptions . from our @xmath3-band",
    "slit spectra , we can clearly pick out these exceptions based on the ew@xmath31 values and take into account the stellar contamination to the nuclear @xmath3-band fluxes .",
    "however , there is one caution for this correction process .",
    "the pah emission observed in star - forming regions primarily comes from photo - dissociation regions located between hii regions and molecular gas , and not from the hii regions themselves @xcite .",
    "if the star - forming regions have such a high radiation density that their emitting volumes are predominantly occupied by hii regions with virtually no photo - dissociation regions , then no 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission is expected .",
    "although this is the case for the nuclear star cluster in the dwarf galaxy ngc 5253 @xcite , this kind of star - forming regions are probably minor exceptions .",
    "figure 3b compares the nuclear @xmath30 color with ew@xmath31 for our sample of seyfert 2s . using a statistical test by isobe et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , the probability that a correlation is not present is found to be 30% , suggesting an anti - correlation between the @xmath30 and ew@xmath31 , as expected from the assumption that the featureless @xmath3-band continuum originates in the agn .",
    "if emission from pure hii regions were contributing significantly to the nuclear @xmath3-band featureless continuum in many seyfert 2 galaxies , then the estimated agn contribution to the nuclear @xmath0-band flux would be overestimated . in this case",
    ", the corrected co indices would be smaller than the above estimates .    in fig.2b , 40% ( = 10/25 ) of the observed seyfert 2",
    "galaxies have corrected co indices ( co@xmath36 ) that are as large as those of star - forming or elliptical ( = spheroidal ) galaxies ( co@xmath25 @xmath11 0.15 ; goldader et al .",
    "1997a , b ; ivanov et al .",
    "since very young star - formation , with less than a few million years in age , should show very small co@xmath25 values @xcite , such star - formation is missed in this @xmath0-band co absorption method .",
    "furthermore , when the agn dilution is very severe in the @xmath0-band , the co absorption features are very weak and so the correction of the observed spectroscopic co indices for the agn dilution is not possible .",
    "in fact , for ngc 7674 and f01475@xmath120740 , although on - going nuclear star formation is indicated from the detected 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission feature , no clear co absorption features are detected .",
    "thus , this fraction ( = 40% ) should be taken as a lower limit of seyfert 2 nuclei with stellar emission .",
    "the stellar signatures detected in the nuclei of seyfert 2s can be due either to nuclear starbursts in the agn torus and/or old bulge ( = spheroid ) stars . since both starbursts and old bulge stars show co@xmath25 @xmath37 0.15 , these two populations are not easily distinguishable based on the co@xmath25 values alone @xcite . to further understand the nature of the detected stellar emission in the @xmath0-band",
    ", we combine the @xmath0-band data with the @xmath3-band spectra @xcite .",
    "figure 4 compares observed co index with ew@xmath31 ( shown in the column 6 of table 2 ) .",
    "they are weakly correlated .",
    "@xcite implicitly assumed that the detected 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission originates in the putative nuclear starbursts in the agn torus .",
    "here we test this assumption in a quantitative manner based on the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission luminosity measured in our apertures , because starbursts and old bulge stars are distinguishable in terms of emission surface brightness .",
    "@xcite estimated a star - formation rate per unit area of 10@xmath7 m@xmath38 yr@xmath7 kpc@xmath39 as the lower limit beyond which the superwind activity , a characteristic property of starburts , can occur .",
    "this limit corresponds to an infrared surface brightness of s@xmath40 @xmath15 2 @xmath41 10@xmath42 ergs s@xmath7 kpc@xmath39 @xcite , or a 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission surface brightness of s@xmath31 @xmath15 2 @xmath41 10@xmath43 ergs s@xmath7 kpc@xmath39 @xcite . among the 25 seyfert 2s studied in this paper , the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission",

    "the surface brightnesses of the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission are summarized in the last column of table 2 .",
    "for all the pah - detected sources , the observed surface brightnesses significantly exceed the threshold required for starbursts .",
    "therefore , for the pah - detected seyfert 2 nuclei , we can conclude that the detected 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission must come from a nuclear starburst , and can not be of old stellar origin .",
    "figure 5 compares the @xmath0-band stellar luminosity with the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission luminosity from the seyfert 2 nuclei measured from our slit spectra . in infrared - luminous starburst galaxies , the @xmath0-band to infrared luminosity ratios",

    "the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah to infrared luminosity ratios in starbursts are estimated to be l@xmath31/l@xmath40 @xmath15 10@xmath46 @xcite .",
    "thus , the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah to @xmath0-band luminosity ratios are expected to be l@xmath31/l@xmath44 @xmath15 10@xmath47 , if both luminosities trace starbursts .",
    "this value is shown as a solid line in figure 5 .",
    "the observed ratios in the seyfert 2s in our sample are smaller , by a large factor , than the value expected for starbursts .",
    "if the starbursts are very young , with ages of less than a few million years , then l@xmath44/l@xmath40 decreases @xcite , and thus the discrepancy between the observed and expected l@xmath31/l@xmath44 ratios is even larger .",
    "figure 5 suggests that in the nuclei of seyfert 2s , compared to starbursts , l@xmath31 is underluminous or l@xmath44 is overluminous .",
    "one possibility for the l@xmath31 underluminosity is the destruction of pah emitting material by energetic radiation from the central agn @xcite .",
    "however , since the putative nuclear starbursts are expected to occur at the outer part of the obscuring torus where the agn radiation is significantly attenuated @xcite , this destruction is unlikely to be severe . aside from the pah destruction by the agn radiation , the pah emission may be suppressed if the stellar radiation density is so high that the volume fraction of photo - dissociation regions relative to hii regions is substantially smaller than typical starbursts .",
    "if the pah destruction in the nuclear starbursts in the agn tori were more severe than typical starburst galaxies , the actual infrared luminosity of the nuclear starbursts would be substantially larger than the estimate based on the assumption of l@xmath31/l@xmath40 @xmath15 10@xmath46 @xcite .",
    "however , we regard this possibility as unlikely , because for a few selected seyfert 2s for which the luminosities of the nuclear starbursts were estimated both from the uv and 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission ( assuming l@xmath31/l@xmath40 @xmath15 10@xmath46 ) , the estimated nuclear starburst luminosities agree quantitatively well @xcite .",
    "we suggest that our @xmath0- and @xmath3-band results are more naturally explained by a scenario where the 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission originates in the spatially - unresolved ( smaller than sub - arcsec ) nuclear starbursts in the agn torus , whereas the signatures of stellar emission detected in the @xmath0-band spectra are produced mainly by old bulge stars .",
    "in fact , the nuclear @xmath3-band emission of seyfert 2s is dominated by spatially - unresolved emission rather than the bulge component , whereas the extended stellar components often contribute predominantly to the nuclear @xmath0-band emission @xcite .",
    "old bulge stars can contribute significantly to the nuclear @xmath0-band fluxes , but can not to the pah emission due to the paucity of pah - exciting far - uv photons in bulges compared to starbursts .",
    "this scenario explains the small l@xmath48/l@xmath44 ratios observed in figure 5 . in this scenario , the co absorption strength is primarily due to old bulge stars , rather than nuclear starbursts , and thus it may not be a useful tool to detect the putative nuclear starbursts in the agn torus .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the conclusion by @xcite .      to improve the statistics ,",
    "so far we have discussed near - infrared emission properties by combining both the cfa and 12 @xmath1 m seyfert 2s together . however , since selection criteria of these samples are different , a separate discussion of seyfert 2s in each sample is of interest .",
    "figure 6 plots the distribution of co@xmath28 , ew@xmath31 , l@xmath31/l@xmath40 , and l@xmath31/l@xmath49 . in all the plots , no systematic differences are found between seyfert 2s in the cfa and 12 @xmath1 m samples .",
    "thus , the main arguments in this paper are taken to be applicable to seyfert 2 stellar populations in general .",
    "in particular , the l@xmath31/l@xmath40 ratios in fig.6c and l@xmath31/l@xmath49 in fig.6d trace the relative contribution from the nuclear starbursts to the infrared and nuclear stellar @xmath0-band luminosity , respectively @xcite .",
    "there was a possibility that the 12 @xmath1 m seyfert 2s may be biased to those with powerful nuclear starbursts @xcite , because the starbursts can be strong emitters at 12@xmath1 m .",
    "the absence of systematic differences in fig.6c and 6d suggests that no such strong bias is present in the 12 @xmath1 m seyfert 2 sample .",
    "we have presented results from a near - infrared @xmath0-band slit spectroscopic survey of 25 seyfert 2 galaxies in the cfa and 12 @xmath1 m samples .",
    "these data have been combined with results from the @xmath50 m pah emission survey of imanishi ( 2003 ) .",
    "the co absorption features at @xmath4 = 2.32.4 @xmath1 m have been used to investigate the properties of the stellar populations in the nuclei of seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "we have found that the observed values of the co indices in a large fraction of seyfert 2 nuclei are affected by dilution produced by the featureless continuum associated with the agn , because seyfert 2 nuclei with redder @xmath2 colors tend to show shallower co absorption features . for sources with modestly large observed co indices ( @xmath110.1 ) ,",
    "we have corrected the co indices for agn dilution .",
    "this correction has made a small change for the overall distribution of the co indices in our sample and we have estimated that @xmath1540% ( = 10/25 ) of seyfert 2 nuclei have co indices similar to those of star - forming or elliptical ( = spheroidal ) galaxies .",
    "this is only a lower limit of seyfert 2 nuclei with stellar emission because young star - formation shows no co absorption features and because in seyfert 2 nuclei where the @xmath0-band light is dominated by agn emission , the correction of the observed co indices for agn dilution is not possible .",
    "a comparison between the nuclear 3.3 @xmath1 m pah to stellar @xmath0-band luminosity ratio in the nuclei of seyfert 2s and observations for infrared luminous starburst galaxies implies that the co absorption features detected in the nuclear @xmath0-band spectra of seyfert 2 galaxies are due mainly to old bulge ( = spheroid ) stars rather than the putative nuclear starbursts in the agn torus , and thus that the putative starbursts are difficult to detect with @xmath0-band spectra over the scales probed by our data ( 250pc to 1kpc ) .",
    "we found no clear difference in the properties of the 2.3 @xmath1 m co absorption and 3.3 @xmath1 m pah emission features between the cfa and 12 @xmath1 m seyfert 2 samples .",
