    "this can be exemplified in the master formula for @xmath5 , see @xcite and references therein @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the fermi constant , @xmath11 incorporates the short distance electroweak corrections and @xmath12 is the phase - space integral depending on the slope and curvature of the form factors .",

    "one powerful technique is the application of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) as an effective field theory describing low energy strong interactions .",
    "the determination of @xmath8 at one loop order within chpt was evaluated by gasser and leutwyler @xcite . along the same lines",
    "the calculations were extended further to incorporate two loop order corrections @xcite . despite its model - independent prediction ,",
    "however , chpt calculations may become less predictive at higher orders due to undetermined parameters .",
    "lattice qcd on the other hand , is a brute force approach to determine the qcd observables by evaluating the functional integral of qcd numerically . in recent years",
    "the technical procedures have reached to a point that calculations with relatively small quark masses are feasible , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "lattice data are not free from systematic errors e.g. finite volume effects and chiral extrapolation .",
    "as soon as pion mass is small enough and lattice size is large enough in order to make legitimate application of chpt for the extrapolations , one can get reliable predictions out of lattice qcd data .",
    "there are a large amount of works in the literature on exploiting chpt to correct the systematic errors .",
    "lattice size effects on pion mass are studied in @xcite and for pion decay constant in @xcite . along the same arguments",
    "this type of calculations are done for quark vacuum expectation values @xcite . moreover ,",
    "finite volume effects on pion pion scattering parameters are evaluated near threshold @xcite .",
    "there exist lattice data on the semileptonic vector and scalar form factors , see for example @xcite .",
    "as suggested in @xcite the starting point in doing these calculations in the lattice is to obtain the scalar form factor at the maximum momentum transfer @xmath13 , where high statistical accuracy is achievable .",
    "we then deem interesting to evaluate the finite size effects for the scalar semileptonic kaon decay .",
    "this decay gives the important key role in kaon physics .",
    "therefore we set the main motivation of the present work as pushing the line of the chpt applications to a case which involves external momentum . for the sake of simplicity we assume external momentum takes on zero spatial component . to this end",

    "the expansion parameter is generically in terms of the momentum , @xmath14 , and quark mass , @xmath15 .",
    "later on gasser and leutwyler in two elegant papers extended the lagrangian to order @xmath16 @xcite .",

    "the effective lagrangian to be used for a system enclosed into a finite size is the same as one we use for processes which occur in infinite volume with the same values for the low energy effective constants .",
    "the pioneering works @xcite provide the foundations in this regards . to do the calculations in finite volume as suggested in @xcite one imposes a periodic boundary condition on particle fields which results in the momentum quantization and consequently the modifications of the quantum corrections .",
