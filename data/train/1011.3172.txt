    "the @xmath1-laplacian equation appears in several mathematical models in fluid dynamics , such as in the modelling of non - newtonian fluids and glaciology @xcite , turbulent flows @xcite , climatology @xcite nonlinear diffusion ( where it is called the @xmath17-diffusion equation ; see @xcite for the original article and @xcite for some current developments ) , flow through porous media @xcite , power law materials @xcite and in the study of torsional creep @xcite .",

    "on the other hand , as proved in @xcite , positive solutions are unique when @xmath38 is a ball , while for general bounded domains the uniqueness of positive solutions that reach the minimum energy ( ground states ) was established in @xcite under the conditions @xmath51 and @xmath54 .",
