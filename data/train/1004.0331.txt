    "much action takes place during the @xmath7 billion years of cosmic time between @xmath8 and @xmath9 : both the global star - formation rate ( sfr ) and nuclear ( agn ) activity peak at @xmath10 , while much of the galaxy assembly and morphological differentiation are taking place and a population of massive , passively evolving galaxies is gradually emerging .",
    "thus a full exploration of this redshift interval is critical for our understanding of galaxy evolution .",
    "unfortunately , this is also a relatively difficult redshift range to penetrate observationally , as strong spectral features such as h&k and the 4000  break ( for passive galaxies ) and [ ] @xmath11 , [ ] @xmath12 , h@xmath3and h@xmath13(for star forming ones ) have all moved to the near - infrared ( nir ) .",
    "still , most spectroscopic surveys of galaxies at @xmath14 have used optical spectrographs , relying on much weaker spectroscopic features for redshift determination and galaxy characterization , with these limitations being partly compensated by the possibility to achieve a fairly high multiplex ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . for passive galaxies at @xmath15",
    "such features practically restrict to a set of absorption features at @xmath16@xmath17  due to neutral and singly ionized mg and fe , and for star - forming galaxies to several weak absorption lines over the rest - frame uv continuum , most of which due to the interstellar medium ( ism ) of these galaxies .",
    "the intrinsic weakness of the absorptions and/or of the continuum made such spectroscopic observations very demanding in terms of telescope time .",
    "therefore , several studies of large samples of galaxies at @xmath18 have relied on color selections and photometric redshifts .",
    "particularly effective has proven the @xmath0 criterion introduced by @xcite , which is able to select both star - forming ( called @xmath1s ) as well as passively evolving galaxies ( @xmath19s ) over this redshift range .",
    "this has enabled estimates of sfrs , stellar masses , and clustering properties of such galaxies , with samples from @xmath20 s to over @xmath21 objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath0 technique ensures a nearly unbiased selection of @xmath10 galaxies , including uv - selected galaxies and single color , nir - selected galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "whereas many aspects concerning the evolution of galaxies can be investigated using only photometric redshifts , spectroscopy remains indispensable for a variety of investigations .",
    "these include full mapping of the local environment ( locating clusters , groups , filaments and voids ) , refining sfr and mass estimates , measure stellar and ism metallicities , and finally map the internal dynamical workings of galaxies via 3d spectroscopy . in this respect ,",
    "the required telescope time is not the only drawback of the optical spectroscopy of galaxies at @xmath22 . indeed , optical spectroscopy down to a limit as faint as @xmath23 does not recover but a minor fraction of the global sfr and stellar mass at @xmath10 , in particular missing galaxies that are among the most massive and most intensively star - forming ones @xcite .",
    "moreover , high spatial resolution , 3d spectroscopy of high redshift galaxies requires the knowledge of the spectroscopic redshift , to make sure that interesting emission lines ( e.g. , h@xmath3 ) are free from oh and other atmospheric contaminations ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the case of star - forming ( @xmath1",
    ") galaxies , the poor correlation of mass and sfr with @xmath24 magnitude is a result of high extinction .",
    "therefore , the situation should appear more favorable in the nir , and not only because moving to longer wavelengths should reduce the impact of extinction , but also because the most active star - forming and most massive galaxies are also among the brightest objects at these longer wavelengths , and one can access strong emission lines such as [ ] and h@xmath3 .",
    "yet , nir spectroscopy of @xmath25 galaxies is still in its infancy , especially for nir selected samples . @xcite",
    "have presented results for over 100 uv - selected galaxies at @xmath10 , deriving sfrs from the strength of h@xmath3 .",
    "nir spectroscopic observations of samples of @xmath10 galaxies selected in the nir have been also presented by @xcite , focusing mainly ( but not exclusively ) on passive galaxies by detecting the 4000  break , and deriving spectro - photometric redshifts from it .",
    "nir spectroscopy of @xmath1 galaxies has been carried out by @xcite for a sample of 40 @xmath1s , and detected h@xmath3emission from 15 of them .",
    "their detections , however , are limited to @xmath26 . finally ,",
    "integral field nir spectroscopy for some 60 star forming galaxies at @xmath10 has been obtained by @xcite , for partly uv - selected , partly @xmath0-selected targets .",
    "therefore , there is still just scanty spectroscopic information in the rest - frame optical wavelength for actively star - forming and heavily obscured galaxies at @xmath27 , many of which would be missed by the uv - selection , and or are virtually unreachable by current optical spectroscopy .    in the perspective of improving upon this situation , in 2004 we started nir spectroscopic observations of @xmath10 galaxies primarily selected on @xmath0 technique , and using a variety of nir instruments , namely ohs , cisco and moircs , at the subaru telescope and sinfoni at the vlt .",
    "our intent was to explore the effectiveness of nir spectroscopy to improve our characterization of @xmath10 galaxies using a relatively small pilot sample of them , while assessing the feasibility of wider surveys with future instruments with higher multiplex . in this paper",
    "we present the results of observations with the ohs / cisco instruments on subaru and sinfoni instrument on vlt of @xmath1galaxies , leaving the results obtained with the moircs instrument for a future paper . with the observations presented here we have attempted to measure for each galaxy the dust extinction , sfr , ism metallicity , and dynamical mass , while checking for a possible agn contribution .",
    "physical quantities are derived assuming the concordance cosmology , i.e. , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 @xmath31  mpc@xmath32 and photometric magnitudes are expressed in the ab system @xcite if it is not explicitly noted otherwise .",

    "the numerical factor in equation ( [ eq : mdyn ] ) could also be a dominant source of uncertainty .",
    "the adopted value of 5 is valid for a sphere of uniform density , while the actual value of this factor depends on various parameters , such as the mass distribution within the galaxy , its velocity structure , and the relative contributions of rotation and pressure support for star - forming regions @xcite .",

    "in addition to the @xmath1sin this study , we also consider masses and abundances of the following @xmath10 objects : 6 distant red galaxies ( drgs ) at @xmath280 @xcite where only one out of 6 presented in @xcite is used here because 4 drgs show obvious agn features ( broad - line and high [ ] /h@xmath3ratio ) , and for another object neither n2 nor @xmath133 indicators could be used for a metallicity measurement ; 87 uv - selected ( bx / bm ) star - forming galaxies at @xmath281 @xcite which are binned into 6 mass bins containing @xmath282 galaxies per bin ; the lyman - break galaxy ms1512-cb58 at @xmath283 @xcite ; and finally the average of 7 smgs with [ ] /h@xmath3@xmath284 at @xmath285 @xcite .",
    "the stellar masses are all corrected to the salpeter imf , taking gravitational lensing into account in the case of cb58 .",

    "the ism abundances of @xmath1sappears to be consistent with those of @xmath27 galaxies of comparable mass , although selected according to different criteria ( i.e. , drgs and smgs ) , while the @xmath274-@xmath273relation of uv - selected galaxies from @xcite tend to show slightly lower ( @xmath287@xmath288 dex ) abundances at a given stellar mass .",
    "this offset from the @xmath274-@xmath273relation of uv - selected galaxies which is generated by the spectral stacking can be seen also when compared with the metallicities of the composite spectra of @xmath1sat similar stellar mass .",
    "since the metallicity uncertainties are rather large , this offset may not be very significant .",
    "also @xcite have reported a @xmath289 dex higher average metallicities of their @xmath1scompared to uv - selected galaxies .",
    "our metallicities are closer to those of @xcite than to those of @xcite , though uncertainties are large .",
    "@xcite also mentioned a possible bias towards higher metallicity objects , which would enable us to detect [ ] emissions , hence to measure the metallicity .",
    "indeed , their stacked spectrum of [ ] undetected objects yields roughly the same metallicity as that of uv - selected galaxies .",
    "@xcite noted the differential redshift evolution of the @xmath274-@xmath273relation from @xmath290 to @xmath291 , with the most massive galaxies at @xmath290 ( @xmath292 ) being already enriched to the ism abundances of the local galaxies , while less massive galaxies start leaving the local @xmath274-@xmath273relation already at redshift as low as @xmath275 .",
    "our result extends this trend to higher redshifts , finding that at the high mass end the chemical enrichment was virtually complete by @xmath10 .",
    "this indicates that massive galaxies evolve faster than less massive galaxies , where star formation and ensuing chemical enrichment are slow and last longer , i.e. , yet another manifestation of _",

    "in particular , the specific star - formation rate ( ssfr ) , defined as the sfr per unit stellar mass , is widely used to quantify the contribution of current star - formation activity to the growth of the total stellar mass , i.e. , of how efficiently stars are formed .    in figure [ fig : ssfr_bzk ] , we plot the ssfr as a function of stellar mass for @xmath1galaxies with h@xmath3detection . though the scatter and uncertainty in stellar mass are large , the average ssfr ( in yr@xmath32 ) is around @xmath293 , and the ssfr@xmath294 does not show a detectable slope .",

    "sfrs of drgs and uv - selected star - forming galaxies at @xmath27 are derived from h@xmath3luminosities with extinction correction described in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the sfr of smgs is derived from sub - mm emission . since",
    "these sfrs are taken from the original papers , which besides different selection criteria have also used a variety of different observables ( such as uv - luminosity , h@xmath3luminosity , fir luminosity and radio luminosity ) , it is not a surprise to find even large systematic differences .    from low to high redshift , ssfrs at a given stellar mass increase systematically as shown by e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1spresented in this study distribute around the average ssfr-@xmath274 relation for @xmath1sin these two latter studies .",

    "note that the @xmath274-ssfrrelations for sdss star - forming galaxies at @xmath278 , @xmath295 and for @xmath1sat @xmath27 have almost flat slopes , ranging from @xmath296 to @xmath297 , while the distribution of uv - selected galaxies in @xcite shows a much steeper slope .",

    "the discrepancy with respect to other , steep @xmath274-ssfrrelations is ascribed to selection effects @xcite , e.g. , the uv selection being biased against massive , highly obscured and intensively star - forming galaxies , and in addition to a systematic underestimate of the dust extinction with increasing mass @xcite . regarding the discrepancy of slopes between h@xmath3spectroscopic surveys ,",
    "an uncertain extinction correction for h@xmath3from sed fitting might be one of the major causes .",
    "larger spectroscopic samples , exploring a wider range of stellar masses and sfrs , and detecting of h@xmath13 in addition to the h@xmath3(so to estimate accurate dust extinctions from the balmer decrement ) would be crucial for an independent evaluation of the slope in @xmath274-ssfrrelation at @xmath27 .",
    "our results , though relative to a very small sample , are in line with those of @xcite and @xcite .      in this section",
    "we try to interpret the @xmath274-@xmath273and @xmath274-ssfrrelations with evolutionary population synthesis models .",
    "we use the pgase.2models that are also used for sed fitting to derive stellar masses and dust extinction parameters .",
    "these are one - zone models which neglect interactions and merging of galaxies , that are naturally expected in hierarchical structure formation scenario .",
    "they also neglect galactic winds driven by supernovae and/or agn feedback , that are known to exist and are responsible for the metal enrichment of the intergalactic and intracluster media .",
    "although a galaxy rarely evolves as is modeled by pgase.2 , its simple description may give us a starting point towards understanding the @xmath274-@xmath273and @xmath274-ssfrrelations , and indicate in which direction we should try to find more satisfactory solutions .",
    "a detailed comparison with the full numerical simulation is not the focus of this paper .",
    "two scenarios , the simple closed - box model and the infall model for chemical enrichment , are considered here with a salpeter imf from @xmath298 to @xmath299 and the b - series of chemical yields from @xcite .",
    "these models assume that a galaxy is initially a purely gas cloud with zero metallicity , @xmath300 , and the sfr is assumed to be proportional to the gas mass ( i.e. , a schmidt law with @xmath301 ) : @xmath302 where @xmath303 is the star - formation timescale .",
    "closed - box models assume no gas infall and all gas resides in the system at the beginning .",
    "this is the classical _ monolithic collapse _ scenario . in the infall models ,",
    "initially all gas is assumed to be in an outer reservoir and falls into the inner star - forming region at a rate of @xmath304 where @xmath305 is the infall time scale .",
    "we use models with @xmath306 and @xmath307 gyr and we assume @xmath308 for infall models .",
    "short time scale models with @xmath306  gyr can successfully reproduce the color - magnitude ( c - m ) relations of elliptical galaxies in nearby clusters of galaxies @xcite , and long time scale models with @xmath309  gyr can explain the photometric properties of nearby late type , sb ",
    "sc , galaxies @xcite .",
    "following , the ism oxygen abundance is derived from the gas - phase metal mass fraction using the relation : @xmath310 assuming the solar abundance pattern reported by @xcite and the solar oxygen abundance from @xcite .    figures [ fig : mzrelevo ] and [ fig : ssfrevo ] show that both the closed - box and the infall models with @xmath306 gyr can roughly reproduce the locations of @xmath1sand other populations of @xmath27 galaxies at the massive end of the @xmath274-@xmath273relation and of the @xmath274-ssfrrelation , with @xmath311 myr ages and @xmath312 of gas mass .",
    "this range of ages is also roughly consistent with the onset epoch of galactic winds needed by the models of @xcite to reproduce the c - m relations of elliptical galaxies in the virgo and coma clusters . on the other hand , models with longer time scale , e.g. , @xmath309 gyr ,",
    "can not fit both relations simultaneously .",
    "for example , @xmath309 gyr infall models take @xmath313 gyr to reach the observed metallicities of @xmath27 galaxies , while the age of the universe at @xmath27 is only @xmath314 gyr for the adopted cosmology .",
    "only simple models can reproduce the distribution of @xmath1sand @xmath27 galaxies in the @xmath274-@xmath273relation with such long @xmath303 .",
    "however , in the @xmath274-ssfr relation , it turns out that simple models with longer time scale require huge amount of initial gas , @xmath315 , which is larger than typical stellar mass of the most massive early - type galaxies found in the local universe .",
    "moreover , the ages and stellar masses mentioned above imply an average @xmath316 , much in excess of the observed sfrs of galaxies in such mass range .    on the other hand , equations (",
    "[ eq : pegasesfr ] ) and ( [ eq : pegaseinfall ] ) imply a secularly declining sfr , such that all galaxies are assumed to have started with their maximum sfr and to be caught at their minimum sfr .",
    "this assumption is especially doubtful at @xmath10 , where the sfr of many star - forming galaxies may actually increase with time , rather than decrease @xcite .",
    "the high sfrs in the @xmath0galaxies presented here require galaxies to host a large amount of molecular gas to be used for star formation .",
    "recent millimeter and radio observations have been revealing that star - forming @xmath0 galaxies indeed harbor large amount of co molecules , hence also molecular hydrogen @xcite .",
    "these co observations as well as multi - wavelength sed analysis @xcite suggest that the gas consumption or star - formation timescale could be up to 1  gyr rather than @xmath317  myr inferred in this study . in the framework of pgase.2used here ,",
    "@xmath318  gyr is in fact an upper limit in order to reproduce the observed @xmath274-@xmath273and @xmath274-ssfrrelations at the same time , still being consistent with @xcite .",
    "again , note that closed - box or infall models are certainly oversimplifications over the real star - formation histories of galaxies .",
    "recent numerical simulations favor continuous ( albeit fluctuating ) cold - stream accretion for the main driver of the galaxy growth , rather than short - lived starbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , infall models may capture this aspect , but the results must critically depend on the assumed evolution with time of the infall rate .",
    "smgs , which are outlier in the @xmath274-ssfrrelation , require extremely young ages , a few 10 myr , while in the @xmath274-@xmath273relation they occupy nearly the same position as other @xmath27 star - forming galaxies .",
    "this is possibly due to vigorous , merger - driven starbursts rather than due to internal star - formation mode assumed in the one - zone pgase.2models .",
    "these violent star - formation processes could push a galaxy almost vertically @xcite in the @xmath274-ssfrdiagram , with little change of its position in the @xmath274-@xmath273diagram .",
    "we have conducted nir spectroscopic observations of 28 @xmath1galaxies at @xmath319 and detected h@xmath3emissions from 14 of them . by using the h@xmath3and [ ] lines ,",
    "we have derived h@xmath3sfrs and gas phase oxygen abundances .",
    "stellar masses and reddening parameters have been also derived by sed fitting to the multi - wavelength photometric data .",
    "our results are summarized as follows :    * stellar masses and reddening parameters derived from sed fitting agree well with those derived by @xmath0-based recipe introduced by @xcite . *",
    "a comparison of sfrs from different indicators ( h@xmath3 , extinction corrected uv , and uv+mir ) indicates that additional extinction towards regions over that derived from the sed fitting of the stellar continuum is required for the h@xmath3sfr to recover the total sfr inferred from uv+mir .",
    "the required additional extinction is in agreement with the recipe proposed by @xcite .",
    "* one object , d3a-11391 , shows mir - excess and a broad h@xmath3component with @xmath320@xmath31 , as well as a narrow line component , suggesting that it may host an agn , which would be highly obscured at uv and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "although with large uncertainty , we have estimated the mass of the smbh and its intrinsic x - ray luminosity following @xcite , obtaining @xmath321 , depending on the assumed geometry of the accretion disk , and @xmath322  ergs  s@xmath32 . from these quantities , the mass accretion rate onto the central smbh and eddington factor",
    "are calculated as @xmath323 and @xmath258@xmath259 , again depending on the geometry .",
    "these properties are in between those of normal star - forming galaxies and those of broad - line smgs , indicating a possible evolutionary connection between normal uv / optical - selected galaxies , broad - line / mir - excess @xmath1s , and star - forming broad - line smgs that may result from an accelerated growth of smbh . *",
    "most of @xmath1spresented here have already reached a metallicity similar to that of local star - forming galaxies of the same mass .",
    "they tend to have higher metallicity compared to uv - selected @xmath10 galaxies , even at the top mass end .",
    "this indicates that @xmath1sare on average a more evolved population compared to that of uv - selected galaxies at the same redshift .",
    "* specific sfrs of most @xmath1sare consistent with a tight @xmath274-ssfrcorrelation @xcite , with a couple of outliers reaching very high ssfrs , similar to those of smgs * within the framework of pgase.2closed - box or infall models , the @xmath274-@xmath273and @xmath274-ssfrrelations of @xmath27 @xmath1scan be reproduced simultaneously assuming a very short star - formation or infall timescale , @xmath324  myr , and large gas mass at the beginning .",

    "<S> we have also derived the stellar mass - metallicity relation , as well as the relation between stellar mass and specific sfr , and compared them to the results in other studies . at a given stellar mass , the @xmath1sappear to have been already enriched to metallicities close to those of local star - forming galaxies of similar mass . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1spresented here tend to have higher metallicities compared to those of uv - selected galaxies , indicating that near - infrared selected galaxies tend to be a chemically more evolved population . </S>",

    "<S> the empirical correlations between stellar mass and metallicity , and stellar mass and specific sfr are then compared with those of evolutionary population synthesis models constructed either with the simple closed - box assumption , or within an infall scenario . within the assumptions that are built - in such models </S>",
    "<S> , it appears that a short timescale for the star - formation ( @xmath6  myr ) and large initial gas mass appear to be required if one wants to reproduce both relations simultaneously . </S>"
