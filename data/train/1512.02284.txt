    "this creates a conduction channel within the gap of extended states , described by exponentially confined modes @xmath165 $ ] , which form two symmetric bands @xmath166 .",
    "the channel is thus described by a jackiw - rebbi model for the transport along @xmath113 .    within this channel",
    ", an additional line defect parallel to the @xmath112 axis should therefore produce a point - defect zero - mode that decays exponentially in all directions .",

    "thus , within the continuum limit the point - defect state can be associated with a nontrivial background mass pattern in the system .",
    "note that when this mass pattern is smoothed out , the mass - gap order parameter @xmath172 has a non - trivial topology , with a finite winding number as one encircles the origin along a closed loop .",
    "this observation establishes an additional connection to systems with charge fractionalization @xcite .",
    "we conclude by identifying the continuum interpretation of the constraint . in the tight - binding model ,",
    "the position of the virtual dirac point can be written as @xmath173 , where the displacement @xmath56 $ ] can be interpreted as an imaginary pseudo vector potential ( in analogy to the description of strained graphene ) .",
    "we then can rewrite eq .   as @xmath174 therefore @xmath61 .",

    "<S> these couplings were then translated into a compatible configuration of random displacements , which also introduces disorder into the couplings @xmath67 . in comparison with fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](d ) , we see that the disorder is sufficiently strong to mix the extended states , but does not affect the energy of the zero mode , which remains spectrally isolated </S>",
    "<S> . furthermore , the spatial distribution of this mode shown in fig . [ fig3](b ) exhibits the same localization as observed for the nondisordered lattice in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](e ) . </S>",
    "<S> encouragingly for practical applications , the state remains well localized also for generic disorder , as the spectral isolation of the state suppresses its sensitivity in a perturbative treatment .    </S>",
    "<S> _ mode selection via staggered absorption. _ our considerations also carry over to an onsite potential on the a sublattice . </S>",
    "<S> this includes the choice of an imaginary onsite potential that corresponds to absorption , in generalization of non - hermitian @xmath68-symmetric optics @xcite . in absence of the next - nearest neighbour couplings , </S>",
    "<S> the extended states remain sublattice - balanced for @xmath69 and decay according to @xmath70 ; the states from the flat band decay twice as fast ( @xmath71 ) , while the point - defect state stays pinned at @xmath28 and thus remains unaffected . in the presence of additional amplification , </S>",
    "<S> this correspond to a topological mechanism of mode selection for lasing @xcite . in our experiments </S>",
    "<S> , we implement the absorption by placing elastomer patches on the top of each a sites @xcite , thus inducing a uniform absorption on the a sublattice . </S>",
    "<S> the selection mechanism can be clearly seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] where two situations are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a , b ) shows the effect of the absorption on a dimerized lieb lattice with central defect [ same configuration as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](d ) ] , while fig .  [ fig4](c ) corresponds to the disordered system in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . in both cases , the original flat band and the two dispersive bands </S>",
    "<S> are considerably suppressed , while the zero mode is not affected both spectrally as well as in its spatial distribution . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , absorption on the a sublattice can be used to further enhance the spectral isolation of the defect state .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we showed that a partial breaking of chiral symmetry can be employed to stabilize and isolate point - defect zero modes in bipartite systems with flat bands . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the point - defect zero mode resides on the sublattice with the smaller number of sites ( the minority sublattice ) , and thus displays a chiral anomaly with an opposite sign to the flat - band states , which reside on the majority sublattice as expected for zero modes in systems with a chiral anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> the flat band states can then be removed by breaking the symmetry on the majority sublattice , without any effects on the point - defect zero mode . as we demonstrated experimentally in a microwave realization of a dimerized lieb lattice with next - nearest neighbour couplings , the remaining zero mode is spectrally isolated and spatially localized . </S>",
    "<S> these features increase the robustness of the state , which is useful for applications in photonic mode shaping and guiding , and also provide a route to mode selection via loss imbalance , which can be extended to laser settings .    </S>",
