    "during last years features of the light pseudoscalar @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons , their quark - gluon structure and hard processes involving these particles , e.g. electromagnetic transition form factors ( ffs ) and weak decays @xmath5 , were the subject of numerous experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "especially the recent measurements of the electromagnetic transition ffs @xmath0 and @xmath1 at space - like momentum transfers in the interval @xmath6  @xcite and at the very large time - like momentum transfer @xmath7  @xcite by the babar collaboration caused much excitement . these measurements and their comparison to the space - like data for @xmath8 ff in the similar range by babar and belle collaborations  @xcite stimulated a flurry of theoretical activity , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this debate focuses on the question whether hard exclusive hadronic reactions are under theoretical control , which is highly relevant for all future high - intensity , medium energy experiments like , e.g. , belleii and panda .    in the exact flavor",
    "@xmath2 limit the @xmath3 meson is part of the flavor - octet whereas @xmath9 is a pure flavor - singlet which properties are intimately related to the celebrated axial anomaly  @xcite .",
    "however , it is known empirically that the @xmath2 breaking effects are large and have a nontrivial structure .",
    "these effects are usually described in terms of a certain mixing scheme that considers the physical @xmath10 mesons as a superposition of fundamental ( e.g. flavor - singlet and octet ) fields in the low - energy effective theory , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is not obvious whether and to which extent the approach based on state mixing is adequate for the description of hard processes that are dominated by meson wave functions at small transverse separations , dubbed distribution amplitudes ( das ) , however , it can be taken as a working hypothesis to avoid proliferation of parameters .",
    "one particularly important issue is that eta mesons , in difference to the pion , can contain a significant admixture of the two - gluon state at low scales , alias a comparably large two - gluon da .",
    "several different reactions were considered in an effort to extract or at least constrain these contributions .",
    "non - leptonic exclusive isosinglet decays @xcite and central exclusive production @xcite act as prominent probes for the gluonic fock - state since the gluon production diagram enters already at leading order ( lo ) .",
    "exclusive semi - leptonic decays of heavy mesons were calculated in the framework of light - cone sum rules ( lcsrs )  @xcite and @xmath11-factorization @xcite . from a calculational point of view",
    "these decays are simpler but the interesting gluon contribution enters only at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "numerically it was shown that the gluonic contributions to @xmath3 production are negligible while they can reach a few percent in the @xmath12-channel .",
    "up to now experimental data are not conclusive in all these decays , with a vanishing gluonic da being possible at a low scale . on the other hand ,",
    "a large gluon contribution was advocated in  @xcite from the analysis of @xmath13 transitions ( see also  @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider electromagnetic transition form factors @xmath14 that are the simplest relevant processes and are best understood from the theory side .",
    "also in this case we will find that the present experimental data are insufficient to draw definite conclusions .",
    "however , the forthcoming upgrade of the belle experiment and the kekb accelerator  @xcite that aims to increase the experimental data set by the factor of 50 , will allow one to measure transition form factors and related observables with unprecedented precision .    the special role of the transition ffs as the `` gold plated ''",
    "observables for the study of meson das is widely recognized . to leading power accuracy in the photon virtuality",
    "these ffs can be calculated rigorously in qcd in the framework of collinear factorization ( pqcd )  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of transition ffs in comparison to other hard reactions with the same property is that the leading hard contribution starts already at tree - level and is not suppressed by the usual perturbative penalty factor @xmath15 . for the leading - twist collinear factorization to hold ,",
    "the pqcd contribution has to win against the power - suppressed ( end - point or higher - twist ) corrections , and this is expected to happen for transition ffs already at moderate photon virtualities that are accessible in present experiments .",
    "one more advantage is that soft contributions are simpler and can be modelled to a reasonable accuracy using , e.g. , lcsrs .",
    "the theory of @xmath16 decays is , on the one hand , similar to the qcd description of the @xmath17 transition ff , but , on the other hand , contains specific new issues due to the two - gluon state admixture , contributions of heavy quarks , and also potentially large meson mass corrections . our goal is to present a state - of - the - art treatment of these special issues using a combination of perturbative qcd for the calculation of the leading terms and lcsrs for the estimate of power corrections , complementing our study  @xcite of @xmath8 . for earlier work related to this program , see @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to the calculation of transition form factors makes use of transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) meson wave functions ( tmd- or @xmath11-factorization  @xcite ) .",
    "this is a viable technique that has been advanced recently to nlo , see e.g. @xcite for the electromagnetic pion form factor and @xmath8 , and which can be applied to the @xmath16 transitions as well . because of a more complicated nonperturbative input , interpretation of the corresponding results in terms of das is , however , not straightforward so that we prefer to stay within the collinear factorization framework in what follows .",
    "the theoretical updates implemented in this work are the following :    * the @xmath18-quark contribution to the coefficient function of the two - gluon da ; * complete nlo treatment of the scale - dependence of das including quark - gluon mixing ; * consistent treatment of the corrections due to the strange quark mass to @xmath19 accuracy including an update of the @xmath2-breaking corrections in twist - four das ; * partial account of the anomalous contributions and implementation of @xmath20 mixing schemes in the twist - four das .",
    "we further use these improvements for a numerical analysis of the existing space - like and time - like data , including a careful analysis of the uncertainties , and the prospects to constrain the two - gluon @xmath21 das if more precise data on transition ffs become available .",
    "the presentation is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : da ] is introductory .",
    "we collect here the definitions for twist 2 and 3 das and introduce necessary notation in both the quark - flavor and singlet - octet bases .",
    "different mixing schemes are introduced and discussed . section  [ sec : pqcd ] is devoted to the calculation of the @xmath22 electromagnetic transition ffs in the collinear factorization framework .",
    "complete nlo expressions for the leading twist contributions are given .",
    "we also demonstrate the cancellation of the end point divergences in twist - four contributions at the tree ( lo ) level . the necessity to distinguish between the notion of `` power suppressed '' and `` higher - twist '' contributions is emphasized .",
    "a separate subsection contains the discussion of the difference of time - like and space - like ffs in pqcd ; the results are compared to data  @xcite . in section  [ sec : lcsr ] we start by explaining why the twist expansion of the product of electromagnetic currents does not provide the complete result for the ffs if one of the photons is real , and present the calculation of the remaining soft contributions within the lcsr framework that is based on dispersion relations and quark - hadron duality .",
    "a detailed numerical analysis of the space - like experimental data in this framework is presented in section  [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "the final section  [ sec : summary ] is reserved for a summary and outlook .",
    "the paper contains two appendices where more technical material and/or long expressions are collected .",
    "appendix  [ app : ht ] is devoted to the two- and three - particle twist - four das of the @xmath23 mesons .",
    "it contains an update of the existing expressions @xcite taking into account @xmath2 breaking effects , and also a partial calculation of anomalous contributions to the higher - twist das that arise from the axial anomaly . in appendix",
    "[ app : rg ] complete nlo expressions for the scale dependence of the leading - twist das are presented .",
    "the description of the transition ffs @xmath24 requires knowledge of the momentum fraction distributions of valence quarks in the mesons at small transverse separations , the meson distribution amplitudes .",

    "this restriction is a consequence of @xmath58-parity that implies that quark - antiquark das are symmetric functions under the interchange of the quark momenta @xmath59 in addition we introduce a two - gluon leading - twist da @xmath60 , @xmath61 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the dual gluon field strength tensor @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we use the conventions @xmath66 and @xmath67 , following  @xcite .",
    "the gluon da is antisymmetric @xmath68 and can be expanded in a series of gegenbauer polynomials @xmath69 of odd dimension @xmath70 the flavor - octet gegenbauer coefficients @xmath71 are renormalized multiplicatively at lo , and get mixed with the coefficients @xmath72 with @xmath73 starting at nlo . the flavor - singlet coefficients @xmath74 get mixed with the gluon coefficients @xmath75 already at lo , and also with the coefficients of the polynomials with lower dimension starting at nlo , see appendix  [ app : rg ] for details . in what follows",
    "we refer to these coefficients as shape parameters .",

    "however , it is known empirically that the @xmath2-breaking corrections are large and have a rather nontrivial structure . in chiral effective theory the @xmath9 meson can be included in the framework of the @xmath84 expansion  @xcite . in this approach",
    "the leading effect is due to the axial anomaly which introduces an effective mass term for the @xmath10 states that is not diagonal in the so basis if @xmath2 flavor symmetry is broken .",
    "in addition , there is also an off - diagonal contribution to the kinetic term @xmath85 at loop level  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the relation of physical @xmath23 states to the basic octet and singlet fields in the chiral lagrangian , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , becomes complicated and involves two different mixing angles , see , e.g. , a discussion in ref .",
    "there is no reason to expect that these mixing angles are the same for the matrix elements of all operators of higher dimension that determine moments of das .",
    "thus the classification based on the so mixing scheme without additional assumptions does not seem to be particularly useful in this context as the number of parameters is not reduced .    in the last years",
    "a specific approximation has become popular that we will refer to as the feldmann  kroll ",
    "stech ( fks ) scheme  @xcite .",
    "this construction is motivated by the observation that the vector mesons @xmath88 and @xmath89 are to a very good approximation pure @xmath90 and @xmath91 states and the same pattern is observed in tensor mesons .",
    "the smallness of mixing is a manifestation of the celebrated ozi rule that is phenomenologically very successful .",
    "if the axial @xmath51 anomaly is the _ only _ effect that makes the situation in pseudoscalar channels different , it is natural to assume that physical states are related to the flavor states by an orthogonal transformation @xmath92 this _ state _ mixing is a very strong assumption that implies that the same mixing pattern applies to the decay constants and , more generally , to the wave functions so that @xmath93 and @xmath94 with the same mixing angle @xmath95 .",
    "this is a far reaching conjecture that allows one to reduce the four das of the physical states @xmath10 to the two das @xmath96 , @xmath97 of the flavor states : @xmath98 the singlet and octet das in this scheme are given by @xmath99 and the same relation is valid separately for the couplings @xmath100 and the couplings multiplied by the shape parameters @xmath101 ( [ phiq ] ) .",
