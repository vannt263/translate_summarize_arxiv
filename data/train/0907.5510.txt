    "a critical test of any quantum model is the existence of a semi - classical limit .",
    "this limit - its existence once established - should make contact to known physics , explain qualitative and quantitative results , and thereby render credibility to the model .",
    "most importantly , the semi - classical limit serves to confirm the operational interpretation of the observables of the model .",
    "furthermore , as there exist infinitely many inequivalent quantizations of classical field theories , the semi - classical limit often provides an important tool to distinguish physical relevant models .",
    "the semi - finite spectral triple over a configuration space of connections constructed in @xcite - @xcite constitute a non - perturbative quantum model .",
    "the spectral triple emerges from a fusion between noncommutative geometry @xcite and canonical quantum gravity @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it involves an algebra of holonomy loops and a dirac type operator that resembles a global functional derivation operator .",
    "its existence - as a mathematical entity - was established in @xcite .",
    "its interpretation in terms of a non - perturbative quantum field theory is immediate since the interaction between the algebra and the dirac type operator reproduces the poisson bracket of general relativity , formulated in terms of ashtekar variables , and of yang - mills theory .    what remained unresolved , in the papers @xcite - @xcite , was the exact physical interpretation of the spectral triple construction .",
    "it was not clear whether the model should be understood in terms of gravity or yang - mills theory , or something else .",
    "in particular , no substantial results concerning a semi - classical limit were obtained .    in this paper",
    "we make the first steps towards a semi - classical analysis .",
    "drawing on results by hall @xcite concerning coherent states on compact lie - groups , we construct semi - classical states over the configuration space of connections .",
    "this analysis enlightens us on two fronts :    first , at a conceptual level , the semi - classical analysis entails a clearer physical interpretation of the semi - finite spectral triple .",
    "in particular , we find that the dirac type operator descents , in this limit , to a dirac hamiltonian on a 3 + 1 dimensional ultra - static space - time . through a careful analysis of the poisson structure of general relativity",
    "we first obtain an interpretation of the constituents of the dirac type operator as quantized triad field operators . in short",
    ", the dirac type operator appears as an infinite sum of quantized triad field operators . in the semi - classical limit , these triad operators entail classical triad fields which appear in the classical dirac operator . the special class of semi - classical states constructed in this paper suggest an interpretation as one - fermion states for a spinor field on the ultra - static space - time .",
    "this interpretation has , however , a problem since the scalar product induced on this space depends on the choosen coordinates .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that our analysis indicates that the semi - finite spectral triple should be understood in terms of quantum gravity coupled to quantized matter fields . indeed , if the time - scale is chosen appropriately , then the scalar product becomes coordinate independent .",
    "second , at a more technical level , the semi - classical analysis resolves several questions and ambiguities concerning the construction of the semi - finite spectral triple .",
    "for instance , the triple is build over a countable system of nested graphs . in @xcite",
    "it was clear that the construction would work for a large class of such systems of graphs and no mechanism was found to single out one system of graphs from another .",
    "furthermore , it was also clear that two spectral triples , based on different systems of graphs , would constitute entirely different models .",
    "this ambiguity is resolved through the semi - classical analysis : we find that a system of _ cubic lattices _ is singled out as `` natural '' with an interpretation as a choice of a coordinate system .",
    "this coordinate system is made to coincide with the coordinate system used to write down the ashtekar variables and their poisson bracket .",
    "moreover , the construction of the dirac type operator involves an infinite series of free parameters which is required to diverge in order for the operator to have a compact resolvent . in the papers @xcite - @xcite",
    "no clear physical interpretation of these parameters were found .",
    "again , the semi - classical analysis resolves this ambiguity : it identifies the series of free parameters as the inverse infinitesimal , euclidean volume element , the divergence arising through a continuum limit where the volume elements approach zero .",
    "clearly , the introduction of finite graphs breaks diffeomorphism invariance . in loop quantum gravity @xcite-@xcite , which is also based on an inductive system of graphs @xcite-@xcite ,",
    "the philosophy is to include all possible graphs and thereby restore the symmetries in the inductive limit of graphs and hilbert spaces .",
    "this renders the limiting hilbert space non - separable , something which probably obstructs the construction of a spectral triple @xcite . in this paper",
    "we find that the constructed semi - classical limit does not depend on finite parts of the inductive system of lattices .",
    "thus , in this limit the lattices seemingly dissapear and the symmetries , broken by the initial choice of graphs , are restored .",
    "this means that the expressions for the classical dirac operator and the dirac hamiltonian , found in the semi - classical limit , are coordinate covariant .",
    "the finding that cubic lattices are singled out by the semi - classical analysis plays well with recent results by flori and thiemann which state that , in loop quantum gravity , _ only _ lattices with cubic topology give the right semi - classical limit @xcite .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we briefly review noncommutative geometry and connes work on the standard model . in section 3",
    "we introduce ashtekar variables together with their dual variables , the loop and flux variables . in section 4",
    "we then review the construction of the semi - finite spectral triple .",
    "first , a spectral triple is constructed on a fixed graph , and subsequently a continuum limit of spectral triples is taken over an infinite system of ordered graphs . in section 5 we comment on the underlying space of generalized connections and section 6 is concerned with a careful analysis of the relationship between the spectral triple construction and the poisson bracket between flux and loop variables .",
    "finally , section 7 is concerned with the semi - classical states . in section 8",
    "we give a conclusion .",
    "it is a central observation in noncommutative geometry , due to connes , that the metric of a compact manifold can be recovered from the dirac operator together with its interaction with the smooth functions on the manifold @xcite . in other words the metric",
    "is completely determined by the triple @xmath6 this observation leads to a noncommutative generalization of riemmanian geometries . here",
    "the central objects are _ spectral triples _",
    "@xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a not necessarily commutative algebra ; @xmath9 a hilbert space and @xmath10 an unbounded selfadjoint operator called the dirac operator .",
    "the triple is required to satisfy some interplay relations between @xmath11 mimicking those of @xmath12 . the choice of the dirac operator @xmath10 is strongly restricted by these requirements .    in physics ,",
    "a key example of a noncommutative geometry comes from particle physics .",
    "again , it was connes who realized that the entire data of the standard model coupled to general relativity can be understood as a single , gravitational model formulated in terms of a spectral triple @xcite@xcite- @xcite . here , the algebra is an _ almost commutative algebra _",
    "@xmath13 where @xmath14 is the algebra @xmath15 .",
    "the corresponding dirac operator then consists of two parts , @xmath16 one of which is the standard dirac operator @xmath17 on @xmath18 .",
    "the other part , @xmath19 , is given by a matrix - valued function on the manifold @xmath18 , that encodes the metrical aspects of the states over the algebra @xmath14 .",
    "it is a highly nontrivial and very remarkable fact that the above mentioned requirements for dirac operators force @xmath19 to contain the non - abelian gauge fields of the standard model and the higgs - field together with their couplings to the elementary fermion fields .",
    "in particular the higgs - field thus obtains a geometrical interpretation as being a part of the gravitational field on a noncommutative space .",
    "even more so , the classical action of the standard model coupled to the einstein - hilbert action , in the euclidean signature , emerges from the spectral triple through the so - called spectral action principle @xcite , which states that physics only depends on the spectrum of the dirac operator .    in view of the widely held opinion that quantum effects of the gravitational field will necessarily lead to a noncommutativity of spacetime",
    "this observation indicates that the gauge interactions and the appearance of the higgs field may be interpreted as quantum effects of the gravitational interactions . in other words",
    "they are the first shadows of the noncommutativity of spacetime , visible at the length scale corresponding to the @xmath20-mass .",
    "it should be mentioned in this respect that the spectral action does not directly reproduce the correct coupling constants of the standard model .",
    "in fact it only allows for lesser free parameters than the standard model . in order to obtain the measured coupling constants for the electromagnetic and strong interactions to a fairly good approximation , connes and chamseddine applied renormalization group methods in @xcite and subsequent publications .",
    "this analysis ultimately leads to a prediction of the higgs mass @xcite .",
    "the predicted value , which was based on the assumption of `` the big dessert '' , was recently excluded by tevatron data .",
    "nevertheless it is very remarkable that the use of quantum field theoretical concepts is absolutely essential here to obtain a physically reasonable classical action .    to our point of view",
    "this strongly indicates that the spectral triple used by connes ad chamseddine should be viewed as the semi classical low energy limit of some genuine quantum theory .",
    "one may then also hope that other quantum corrections present in the full theory provide a more realistic value for the higgs mass . since the noncommutative describtion of the standard model is entirely gravitational this full theory",
    "should , presumably , be a theory of the quantized gravitational field .",
    "thus , if there were already a theory of quantum gravity one should certainly investigate whether it admits some semi - classical states that resemble this almost commutative spectral triple .",
    "it was these considerations which motivated the construction of the semi - finite spectral triple over a configuration space of connections @xcite - @xcite .",
    "the idea is to seek a general framework which combines the machinery and ideas of noncommutative geometry with elements of quantum gravity .",
    "the final goal , then , is to make contact to connes work on the standard model through the formulation of a semi - classical analysis .",
    "we start with some notation .",

    "in this section we outline the construction of the semi - finite spectral triple first presented in @xcite and further developed in @xcite .",
    "this spectral triple combines ideas and techniques of canonical gravity and noncommutative geometry .",
    "we first construct a spectral triple at the level of a finite graph .",

    "the reason for this will become clear in the next section where we construct semi - classical states . these states have the property that any dependency on finite parts of the inductive system of lattices vanishes in the semi - classical limit .    in the limit of repeated subdivision of lattices we find that the semi - finite spectral triple @xmath158 encodes information tantamount to a representation of the poisson bracket of general relativity .",
    "thus , the triple carries information of the kinematical sector of quantum gravity .",
    "clearly , the triple is based on a different set of variables than loop quantum gravity and hence the `` representation '' it encodes is different to the representation used there .",
    "in this section we construct semi - classical states in @xmath141 and evaluate their expectation value of @xmath10 .",
    "we will first recall the results for coherent states on compact connected lie groups that we are going to use . for simplicity",
    "we will only consider the case of most interest , namely @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath214 be a basis for @xmath215 .",
    "given @xmath216 in @xmath32 and given three momenta ( real numbers ) @xmath217 there exist families @xmath218 such that @xmath219 and @xmath220 where @xmath221 , and @xmath222 denotes the inner product hereon .",
    "corresponding statements hold for operators of the type @xmath223 where @xmath224 is a polynomial in three variables , and @xmath225 is a smooth function on @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath226 this statement also carries over to symbols , i.e. functions on @xmath227 with certain properties .",
    "the construction of these states follows from work of hall , see @xcite , and are more explicitely described in @xcite section 3.1 .",
    "the states have further inportant physical properties , which we are however not going to use at the present stage of the analysis .",
    "let us consider the @xmath130th level in a subdivision of lattices .",
    "we split the edges into @xmath228 , and @xmath229 , where @xmath230 denotes the edges appearing in the @xmath130th subdivision but not in the @xmath231th subdivision , and @xmath232 the rest . define @xmath233 to be the coherent state on @xmath32 such that @xmath234 and @xmath235 where @xmath221 ; @xmath180 denotes the right endpoint of @xmath169 , and the @xmath171 in the @xmath236 refers to the direction of @xmath169 .",
    "the factor @xmath237 comes from the scaling ( [ scaling ] ) .",
    "furthermore define the states @xmath238 by @xmath239 and @xmath240 finally define @xmath241 to be the product of all these states as a state in @xmath242 .    in the limit",
    "@xmath243 these states produce the right expectation value on all loop operators in the infinite lattice .",
    "we now proceed to construct semi - classical states in @xmath141 . from here on we set @xmath244 and rescale the left - invariant vector fields in the dirac type operator accordingly @xmath245 the first step is to consider again a single edge .",
    "let @xmath246 be a field on @xmath27 .",
    "a priori , @xmath246 can either be a two - spinor or a two - by - two matrix valued field . for reasons which shall become clear later , we choose the second option .",
    "consider again an edge @xmath169 with endpoints @xmath179 and @xmath180 , see figure 8 .",
    "the states in @xmath247 which we are interested in have the form is matrix valued .",
    "if @xmath246 was a two - spinor field then we would instead consider the hilbert space @xmath248 and states therein .",
    "] @xmath249 where the spinor field is evaluated at the endpoints of the edge @xmath169 .",
    "a straightforward computation gives the expectation value of @xmath10 on this state @xmath250 where we applied the expansion @xmath251 with @xmath252 .",
    "also , the index @xmath171 denotes the direction of the edge @xmath169 .",
    "formula ( [ straightforward ] ) indicates that the sequence @xmath160 of free parameters in @xmath10 plays a specific role in the semiclassical analysis .",
    "in particular , note the term @xmath253 . if we consider the limit where the edge @xmath169 lies increasingly deep in the inductive system of graphs , then this term approaches @xmath254 where @xmath255 is the infinitesimal line segment , which goes as @xmath256 . here",
    "@xmath130 denotes the level of subdivisions of graphs .",
    "thus , if we choose the sequence @xmath257 then the expression ( [ straightforward ] ) converges , when one considers edges of increasing depth in the inductive system of lattices , towards the quantity @xmath258 ( again , no sum over @xmath171 ) with @xmath259 .",
    "this is the expectation value ( in a point ) of the self - adjoint operator @xmath260 here , we applied what amounts to a partial integration ( this will be justified shortly where an integral over @xmath27 emerges ) .",
    "next , we consider instead three edges , denoted for simplicity by @xmath261 , @xmath262 , @xmath263 , all leading out of the same vertex , with three copies of @xmath50 associated to them , correspondingly .",
    "first , consider the state @xmath264 where the enumeration of the vertices are show in figure 9 .",
    "we find that the expectation value of @xmath10 on this state leads to the operator @xmath265 in the limit where the edges @xmath169 lie increasingly deep in the inductive system of lattices . in equation ( [ jj ] ) we now sum over @xmath171 .      to obtain semiclassical states on the full space @xmath165 we need to prescribe a procedure to sum up the results for the individual copies of @xmath50 , or rather , for vertices .",
    "first , at the @xmath130th level in the inductive system of lattices , where we have @xmath266 copies of @xmath50 , we write down the state @xmath267 where @xmath268 equals @xmath269 .",
    "this will , in the limit taken below , converge to the lebesque measure .",
    "also , we define @xmath270 see figure 10 . the sum in ( [ leveln ] ) runs over a certain subclass of vertices in @xmath149 . at the @xmath130th level , these vertices are the midpoints of the minimal cubes present at the @xmath271th level .",
    "this discrimination between vertices admittedly appears to be somewhat arbitrary and it might be possible to take into account all edges .",
    "this , however , complicates matters .",
    "we shall return to this point in a later publication .    with ( [ leveln ] )",
    "we have a sequence @xmath272 of states in @xmath141 and we can calculate the limit of the expectation value of @xmath10 on these states .",
    "we call this limit the continuum limit .",
    "we find @xmath273 thus , the sequence of states @xmath272 defines a semi - classical limit where @xmath10 , to lowest order , is a spatial dirac operator on @xmath27 .",
    "notice that the integral in ( [ dex ] ) is the invariant integral over @xmath27 .",
    "the factor @xmath274 , where @xmath275 is the determinant of the spatial metric , comes from @xmath276 . here , however , it should be stressed that the emerging normalization of spinors @xmath246 is _ not _ coordinate invariant .",
    "we shall comment on this below .",
    "note that the emergence of the integral in ( [ dex ] ) crucially depends on the way the car algebra appear in the expression ( [ ourstatesiii ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the elements of the car algebra play the role of _ localizers _ in the construction .      in equations",
    "( [ ourstatesii ] ) and ( [ ourstatesiii ] ) we ignored certain degrees of freedom . to take these into account",
    "we modify the expression in equation ( [ ourstatesiii ] ) to @xmath277 where @xmath278 is an arbitrary self - adjoint two - by - two matrix .",
    "write @xmath279 where @xmath144 and @xmath280 are real fields on @xmath27 , scalar and vectorial respectively .",
    "finally , we let @xmath281 we define @xmath282 and repeat the calculations leading to ( [ dex ] ) . we obtain @xmath283 here",
    ", the first line is the principal part of the dirac hamiltonian in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the second line contain additional zero - order terms .",
    "the fields @xmath144 and @xmath284 are seen to play the role of the lapse and shift fields respectively .",
    "the additional zero - order terms appearing in ( [ dex2 ] ) are not identical to the zero - order terms in the dirac hamiltonian .",
    "this , however , is not to be expected since the dirac hamiltonian is not self - adjoint while the dirac type operator is . for the reconstruction of the 4-metric",
    "only the principal part is used .",
    "we shall return to a discussion of the zeroth order part later .",
    "we believe that the correct treatment of the zeroth order terms can only be performed once the wheeler - de - witt constraint is formulated and implemented and thereby the freedom in choosing the foliation , i.e. the lapse and the shift fields , is eliminated .    this might also be a possible solution to another problem arising at this point .",
    "the norm of the semi - classical states @xmath285 now depends on the lapse and shift fields , @xmath286 where the function @xmath287 is readily computed .",
    "this renders the interpretation of the semi - classical states as constituting the one - fermion states problematic as the induced scalar product is obviously not appropriate .",
    "interestingly , however , the lapse and shift fields may be chosen such that @xmath288 .",
    "thus , an appropriate choice of the time - coordinate restores the invariance of the norm under spatial diffeomorphisms .",
    "however , we are not aware of a compeling physical reason for such a choice of lapse and shift fields . nevertheless , it might be conceivable that there is such a reason , as in quantum field theory , the one - particle space is not invariant under general coordinate changes .",
    "thus , our restriction to one - particle states may well imply a restriction of the choice of coordinates .",
    "the solution to the above problem might also lie in the construction of the states , i.e. it might be possible to modify the constrution of the semi - classical states such that the norm of the semi - classical spinors is automatically coordinate independent .",
    "we shall investigate this problem in future work .    finally , disregarding lapse and shift fields",
    ", we should note that it would also be possible to remedy the deficiency of the missing @xmath274 in the inner product by assigning the zero - order expectation value of the halls coherent states to the non - densitised triad field and then adding , appropriately , the density in the semi - classical state . with this alteration",
    "the inner product of semi - classical states renders the correct inner product of spinors .",
    "however , this choice would spoil the interpretation of the left invariant vector fields as flux operators .",
    "note that @xmath246 takes values in @xmath289 . in view of the action of the @xmath290",
    "s this can consistently be interpreted as a dirac 4-spinor .",
    "the space spanned by these fields @xmath246 can thus be interpreted as the space of solutions of the dirac equation for the static 4-metric described by the 3-metric , the lapse and the shift fields ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we have shown that to certain states for the previously constructed spectral triple over holonomy loops , one can associate gravitational and fermionic matter fields .",
    "this clearly indicates that one should interpret this model as describing quantized gravitational fields coupled to quantized matter fields .    to this concern",
    "we have constructed a small class of semi - classical states . disregarding for the moment the open problem of identifying the correct scalar product ,",
    "these semi - classical states can be interpreted as one - fermion states in a given foliation and given gravitational background field .",
    "we have identified the expectation value of the dirac type operator of the spectral triple , in these semi - classical states , as the expectation value of the energy of the corresponding matter fields .",
    "this raises the question whether one can generally interpret the dirac type operator as the energy operator for the matter fields present in the model .",
    "thus , future work must clarify , first , whether there are many - particle fermionic states present in the model , and , of course , whether additional matter fields , for example photons , can be found .",
    "a consistent interpretation of the dirac type operator then requires that it can also be interpreted as the energy of these states .",
    "a further strong indication that the model should be interpreted in terms of quantum gravity is the fact that it encodes information tantamount to a representation of the poisson bracket of general relativity .",
    "this has been carefully analyzed for the first time in this paper and should therefore be seen as one of its central results .",
    "all this being said , we should stress that our hilbert space can only be viewed as the kinematical hilbert space of quantum gravity .",
    "the wheeler - de - witt constraint has not been constructed nor implemented . in the construction above , this fact is nicely reflected by the appearence of the lapse and shift fields . yet , as the wheeler - de - witt equation should in principle eliminate these unphysical degrees of freedom , the concreteness of their appearence raises the hope that our analysis may lead to a novel approach to the construction and implementation of the hamiltonian constraint in quantum gravity .",
    "+ apart from the physical interpretation of the model , the semi - classical analysis has also proven beneficial at a more technical level : it turned out that the system of nested , cubic lattices , on which the semi - finite spectral triple is based , simply plays the role of a coordinate system .",
    "in particular , the lattices form the coordinate system already used to write down the ashtekar variables and their poisson bracket .",
    "this choice of background structure does , however , not imply lack of background invariance : there is no choice of background metric and the semi - clasical limit is coordinate independent .",
    "this shows that it is possible to recover the spatial symmetries with a countable system of lattices .",
    "yet , it is an issue for future work to establish the full covariance of the model under change of the chosen coordinate system .",
    "these observations are all based on the fact that any dependency on finite parts of the lattices vanishes in the limits ( [ dex ] ) and ( [ dex2 ] ) .",
    "that is , only the continuum limit contributes to the integrals in ( [ dex ] ) and ( [ dex2 ] ) .",
    "it is as if the lattices , which we have used to construct the spectral triple , disappear in this semi - classical limit .",
    "furthermore , the free parameters @xmath160 , which appear in the dirac type operator , play an important role in the semi - classical limit . a priori , this sequence",
    "is only required to diverge in order for the resolvent of the dirac type operator to be compact . in the semi - classical limit , however , the sequence is identified as the inverse , infinitesimal volume element .",
    "this fixes the sequence .",
    "we should stress that we only found states living on static 4-manifolds .",
    "this had to be expected since we interpret these states as one - particle states and it is well known in quantum field theory that such states would not exist on non - static space - times , e.g. in accelerating frames ( which would be described by time - dependent lapse and shift fields ) . in the future it is certainly an interesting question whether one can find and describe semi - classical states which correspond to states of a quantized fermion field on a non - static space - time .",
    "the application of the car algebra as a tool to form the local riemann integral in equations ( [ dex ] ) and ( [ dex2 ] ) is highly intriguing .",
    "it would certainly be very interesting and important to investigate the role played by the car algebra more thoroughly .",
    "moreover , the analysis in this paper is based on a real @xmath32 connection whereas the ashtekar connection is complex .",
    "geometrically , it is desirable to work with the original ashtekar connection .",
    "one may speculate whether the complexity of the connection only appears in the semi - classical limit .",
    "if so , then one might exploit the techniques presented in this paper to obtain a complex connection via a doubling of the hilbert space .",
    "+ immediate tasks to be addressed are : to compute quantum corrections for the semi - classical states in higher order of the planck length ; to investigate the operational interpretation of the loop algebra in the semi - classical states ; to construct many particle states .",
    "hopefully this will provide further evidence that the spectral triple over holonomy loops is a viable candidate for quantum gravity coupled to matter fields .",
