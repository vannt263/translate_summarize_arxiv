    "the first x - ray sources in the early universe were binary systems containing compact objects formed in the collapse of massive stars in low metallicity environments . during the epoch of reionization ,",
    "x - rays from these high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) may have contributed to the heating of the intergalactic medium ( igm )  @xcite .",
    "recent models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that x - ray emission and binary populations are enhanced ( for a given star formation rate ) in regions of low - metallicity .",
    "the theoretical studies find that : ( 1 ) lower metallicity produces weaker stellar winds , which result in a greater number of more massive black holes , and thus more massive black hole hmxbs  @xcite ; and ( 2 ) that the hmxb populations in low metallicity environments are dominated by roche lobe overflow hmxbs which are very effective in transferring mass to the compact object in comparison to the wind - driven , supergiant hmxbs that dominate in high metallicity environments  @xcite .",
    "the observational studies find that the x - ray luminosity function describing the population of hmxbs remains relatively flat ( @xmath5 , where @xmath6 ) , and therefore the total x - ray luminosity of the star - forming region is dominated by the most luminous sources .",
    "the bright end of the x - ray luminosity function consists of the aptly named ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) .",
    "ultraluminous x - ray sources are bright ( @xmath7  erg  s@xmath1 ) extragalactic sources that are not associated with the nucleus of their host galaxy .",
    "studies have concluded that ulxs are likely binary systems containing either a neutron star  @xcite , an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh )  @xcite , or a stellar mass black hole ( stmbh ) with a luminosity that exceeds its eddington limit  @xcite .",
    "the imbh ulxs would have spectra similar to the stmbh binary systems within our galaxy , but with higher luminosities  @xcite .",
    "however , if the compact object accretes at super - eddington rates , then its spectrum will likely differ from the standard sub - eddington black hole binary ( bhb ) states .",
    "@xcite provide an observationally defined state for a set of high quality ulx spectra called the _",
    "ultraluminous state_. this state is characterized by a soft excess modelled by a cool disc with a power law tail and a break in the spectrum above @xmath8  kev .",
    "the curvature at higher energies is not seen in the standard states of galactic bhbs and @xcite identify this state with super - eddington accretion flows onto stmbhs .",
    "the shape of the emission spectrum of the first x - ray sources plays a key role in understanding their contribution to heating of the igm in the early universe and modifies constraints on hmxb population in the first galaxies .",
    "the spectral shape affects how x - rays heat the igm because the mean free path and the fraction of energy deposited as heat versus ionization varies depending on the x - ray s energy @xcite .",
    "the distance the x - rays travel and the energy they deposit in the igm would affect the morphology of the heating and ionization during the epoch of reionization and these effects may be seen in future observations of the redshifted 21-cm hydrogen line ( e.g. , ska ) .",
    "another effect of spectral shape is the modification of the k - correction for high redshift objects .",
    "if the most luminous x - ray sources in the first galaxies exhibit the same type of spectral curvature seen in ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , as opposed to a straight power law , relatively fewer high energy photons would be redshifted into the soft x - ray band .",
    "this would relax the constraint imposed by the observed soft x - ray background allowing for a significant enhancement in the x - ray luminosity of early , star - forming galaxies  @xcite .    in order to determine the spectral shape of ulxs in the early universe , we must study nearby analogues of the first galaxies .",
    "starburst galaxies , such as blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) , have x - ray fluxes that are dominated by the most luminous high - mass x - ray binaries within them  @xcite .",
    "bcds are physically small galaxies with blue optical colors , low - metallicities , large h  i mass fractions , and generally exhibit a recent burst of star formation .",
    "these dwarf galaxies provide the best available local laboratories for young galaxies in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that for @xmath9 the hmxb population of a star forming region should become dominated by roche lobe overflow hmxbs . by extension , this would lead to a larger ulx population .",
    "@xcite used observations to show that the ulx population is enhanced at low @xmath10 and the transition takes place in the range @xmath11 ( @xmath12o / h@xmath13 ) .",
    "the galaxies that were below this range @xmath14 were deemed extremely metal poor galaxies ( xmpgs ) .",
    "it is this population of xmpgs that we chose to focus on , as the earliest galaxies should be very metal poor .    to date",
    ", a total of eight low - metallicity bcds have been found that contain ulxs  @xcite as defined by having a luminosity @xmath15  erg  s@xmath1 ( eddington luminosity of a 10 m@xmath16 black hole ) . of these , six are xmpgs and only two of these bcds , vii  zw  403 ( @xmath17 ) and i  zw  18 ( @xmath18 ) , have had sufficient counts to allow for a spectral study .",
    "other ulxs have been observed in sub - solar metallicity dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , holmberg  ii : @xcite ; holmberg  ix : @xcite ) , and have metallicities ( @xmath19  @xcite for holmberg  ii and @xmath20  @xcite for holmberg  ix ) that may fall within the range for enhanced ulx production @xcite .",
    "however , for this study we strictly examine only the lowest metallicity galaxies , vii  zw  403 and i  zw  18 , as these are the best analogues to the extremely metal poor galaxies in the early universe .    in this paper we focus on vii  zw  403 , a low - metallicity bcd that contains a luminous x - ray binary and is at a distance of 4.34  mpc  @xcite .",
    "a recent _ suzaku _ observation of vii  zw  403 shows the x - ray source to be in a much higher flux state than previous observations and the spectrum is similar to many ulx spectra . in section  [",
    "sect : analysis ] , we describe the procedures used to prepare and analyze our dataset .",
    "results of timing and spectral analysis are presented as well .",
    "we explain the physical motivation for some of the more complex models and discuss them in the context of previous high - quality spectral studies . within section  [",
    "sect : discussion ] , we contrast the spectral evolution of vii  zw  403 with that of i  zw  18 , another low - metallicity bcd containing an hmxb that has been observed to transition between low and high flux states .",
    "the observed spectral state transitions for i  zw  18 are more analogous to the galactic bhbs than the ulx spectra , which is inconsistent with the observed ulx - like spectra of vii  zw  403 .",
    "larger spectral studies and more frequent observations of ulxs within xmpgs will allow for a clearer picture to emerge regarding the spectral states exhibited by hmxbs in the early universe . throughout the paper all fluxes and luminosities are in the 0.38  kev energy range , unless otherwise specificied .",
    "vii  zw  403 was observed with chandra on 2000 - 01 - 07 for a total of 10.6  ks and about 300 counts were detected .",

    ", we fit the spectra and found our parameters to be consistent with the sample of ulxs in the ultraluminous state studied by @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that a compact object with an accretion disk is producing photons that are being upscattered by an optically thick corona .",
    "@xcite have recently reported that the x - ray source p13 , a ulx in ngc 7793 , exhibits all the canonical properties of ultraluminous sources and is in a binary system for which optical modulations constrain the black hole mass to be less than 15 solar masses .",
    "this x - ray source has also been observed to vary in its x - ray luminosity by at least a factor of 40 .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "drawing conclusions about vii  zw  403 from the results of @xcite and others would be speculative but a simple comparison may suggest that vii  zw  403 is a stellar mass black hole undergoing supercritical accretion .",
    "more uniform monitoring over a longer interval is needed to adequately constrain the luminosity evolution of the source .      within vii",
    "zw  403 there is a second known x - ray source ( x-2 ) that lies within the beam of suzaku .",
    "this source has been observed to have a luminosity 25 times dimmer than the main source ( x-1 )  @xcite we have discussed in this paper .",
    "these two objects are separated by a projected distance of 650  pc or about 30  arcsec .",
    "the relative offsets of the suzaku source with respect to the well - defined chandra sources are @xmath49 for x-1 and @xmath50 for x-2 .",
    "suzaku s absolute pointing has an uncertainty of about @xmath51  ( uchiyama 2008 ) .",
    "the psf of the xrts has a broad half - power diameter ( hpd ) of @xmath52 , but a sharp gaussian core of width @xmath53 .",
    "given these two independent errors , the centroid position of the suzaku source is consistent with both x-1 and x-2 .",
    "it is therefore possible that the dimmer source has brightened , but this would require a factor of 1000 change in luminosity , if due solely to this second source .",
    "the xmm and chandra observations are able to resolve these two sources and we find that the flux ratio between x-1 and x-2 decreases by a factor of about 2.7 over the two observations which is consistent with the factor of @xmath54 change in the flux of x-1 alone ( see table  [ tab : fluxes ] ) .",
    "thus , x-1 seems to be the source that is varying , whereas no significant variability is measured for x-2 .    from the study presented in this paper , there is no evidence that the main source in vii  zw  403 is a background agn . the number of expected background sources within the @xmath55 ellipse coincident with vii  zw  403 is @xmath56 , as determined by the @xmath57 curves of @xcite .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that either of the two sources associated with vii  zw  403 are background agn .",
    "@xcite reported a transition from low to high flux for an x - ray binary in the lowest known metallicity bcd , i  zw  18 . the x - ray source was observed to transition from a low - flux state with a hard power law spectrum to a high - flux state with a thermal or exponentially cutoff spectrum .",
    "figure  3 of @xcite shows that at high - flux the source exhibits curvature over the entire @xmath58  kev range .",
    "this type of high - flux state is consistent with galactic black hole binaries and lies in stark contrast to the high - flux state of vii  zw  403 .",
    "as one can see from figure  [ fig : diskpn_comptt ] , vii  zw  403 shows a relatively flat spectrum and curvature only above 5  kev , which is more consistent with high - quality ulx spectra .",
    "the difference in the environments in which the x - ray sources of vii  zw  403 and i  zw  18 reside may provide an explanation for the differences in their spectral evolution .",
    "vii  zw  403 and i  zw  18 are dwarf galaxies with total stellar masses of @xmath59  m@xmath16 and @xmath60  m@xmath16  @xcite , star formation rates of @xmath61  m@xmath16  yr@xmath1 and @xmath62  m@xmath16  yr@xmath1  @xcite , and metallicities of @xmath18 and @xmath17  @xcite , respectively . in figure",
    "[ fig : hst_images ] , one sees that the source in i  zw  18 lies in a dense star - forming region , whereas the object in vii  zw  403 is far from the dynamical center , away from dense regions .",
    "intermediate mass black holes are more likely to form in young , dense clusters where dynamical friction causes the runaway merger of stars over a relatively short timescale , @xmath63  myr  @xcite .",
    "the spectra of these objects ( if in a binary system ) are expected to behave as scaled - up versions of the galactic black hole binaries .",
    "the fact that i  zw  18 exhibits this type of spectral state behavior and that it resides in a dense environment does not rule out the possibility that it is an intermediate mass black hole binary .",
    "however , for the source in vii  zw  403 , given its location and spectral shape , it seems unlikely that it could be an intermediate mass black hole .",
    "more observations that catch these objects in a broad range of luminosity states would be needed to conclusively determine their spectral state transition history and thus the nature of their primary compact objects .",
    "recent results by @xcite illuminate the need for more observations by showing that a known ulx in the nuclear region of m82 , which contains many dense star clusters , is a super - eddington accreting neutron star and not a massive black hole .",
    "most extragalactic ulxs that exhibit spectral curvature are located away from the galactic nucleus and removed from very dense regions  @xcite .",
    "these ulxs , based on their location and spectra , are argued to be stellar mass black hole binaries emitting at super - eddington luminosities , though the mechanism by which this happens is not completely understood .",
    "vii  zw  403 observations are more consistent with these properties , suggesting it may be a super - eddington stellar mass black hole binary .",
    "the transient behavior of vii  zw  403 source is particularly interesting since most `` standard '' ulxs are nontransient and may be active for up to decades in some cases  @xcite . in this way ,",
    "vii  zw  403 is more like the galactic bhbs , spending most of its time in the quiescent state .",
    "more observations of the low and transition states may provide a means to understand the connection between the ultraluminous state and the states commonly seen in galactic black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "study of nearby hmxbs can provide insight into the formation of high mass x - ray binaries formed in the early universe .",
    "observational and theoretical studies have shown that reduced metallicity enhances x - ray binary production and the total x - ray luminosity of a galaxy .",
    "the total luminosity , and hence the spectral shape of the emission from a population of hmxbs , is dominated by a relatively small population of sources in high luminosity states . to date , a total of eight low - metallicity bcds have been found that contain ulxs  @xcite as defined by having a luminosity @xmath15  erg  s@xmath1 ( eddington luminosity of a 10 m@xmath16 black hole ) . only two of these , vii  zw  403 and i  zw  18 , have had sufficient counts to allow for a spectral study and produced inconsistent results .",
    "our discovery of this state transition of an x - ray source in a low - metallicity blue compact dwarf galaxy shows that the sources may undergo a transition to a spectral state with high - energy cutoffs at high luminosity , similar to those seen in other ulxs .",
    "other low - metallicity , star - forming dwarf galaxies , such as holmberg  ii  @xcite and holmberg  ix  @xcite , contain known ulxs that exhibit spectra consistent with the ultraluminous state , as defined by @xcite .",
    "the metallicities of these galaxies are low @xmath64o / h@xmath65 , but do not meet the criteria for being xmpgs @xmath64o / h@xmath66 , mostly occupied by bcds .",
    "low metallicity galaxies , such as ho  ii and ho  ix , may be useful for studies of ulx spectral evolution with metallicity .",
    "these results motivate further spectral studies of luminous hmxbs in nearby analogues of early universe galaxies .",
    "this will allow for better estimates of the spectral shape of hmxbs in the early universe , which affect the ionisation morphology during the epoch of reionization via thermal feedback , and the time at which reionisation was completed .",
