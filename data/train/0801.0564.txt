    "the structure of the relative hilbert scheme was described in elementary terms in @xcite ; in particular , it was explained that the normalisation of the zero - fibre @xmath181 is precisely @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the normalisation of the zero - fibre of @xmath174 .",
    "the two distinguished divisors inside it are the divisors @xmath169 and @xmath170 described in the discussion above ( with @xmath41 and @xmath153 the points of @xmath184 lying over the node of @xmath102 ) , so @xmath181 is obtained by identifying @xmath169 with @xmath170 via @xmath168 .",

    "( note : the manifold appearing here is written as a sum of three different manifolds along two pairs of surfaces , whereas the proposition expresses it as a self - fibre sum of a disconnected manifold along a disconnected surface . )",
    "this remark is due to r. fintushel .",
    "when @xmath195 has genus 1 , the description can be simplified because the second fibre sum has no topological effect .",
    "thus , if we write @xmath204 ( connected sum ) we have @xmath205 indeed , we know that @xmath206 . the summand @xmath207 is the total space of a non - trivial @xmath208-bundle over @xmath209 ( the bundle projection is the abel  jacobi map ) . to perform the second fibre sum , we remove the tubular neighbourhood of a square @xmath196 torus in @xmath210 ( the proper transform of @xmath211 in the second summand ) .",
