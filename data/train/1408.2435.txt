    "if james runs atop a train and his velocity with respect to the train is @xmath0 , while the train has velocity @xmath1 with respect to ground , what is the resulting velocity of james with respect to ground ? before 1905 , we would answer as galileo would : @xmath2 .",
    "but now we know better : his velocity is @xmath3 this elegant expression was discovered by henri poincar @xcite and constitutes the relativistic velocity - addition law in one dimension ( for parallel velocities ) .",
    "velocities are expressed here in natural units , in which the speed of light ( unattainable for objects with mass ) is 1 .     of the runner with respect to the ground ? ]    it is fun to see how such a simple algebraic expression takes care of different physical situations : @xmath4 \\hbox{\\scriptsize\\sf even if he tries really hard : } & & \\frac{4}{5}\\oplus \\frac{5}{6 } =   \\frac{\\frac{4}{5 } + \\frac{5}{6 } } { 1+\\frac{4}{5}\\frac{5}{6 } } = \\frac{49}{50 } < 1 \\\\[10pt ] \\hbox{\\scriptsize\\sf or flashing light while running } & & v\\oplus1 =   \\frac{v+1}{1+v\\cdot 1 } = 1 \\\\[10pt ] \\hbox{\\scriptsize\\sf in both directions : } & & v\\oplus -1 =   \\frac{v-1}{1+v\\cdot(-1 ) } = -1 \\\\[10pt ] \\hbox{\\scriptsize\\sf the desperate extreme addition : }                     & & 1\\oplus 1 =   \\frac{1 + 1}{1 + 1\\cdot 1 } = 1 \\end{array}\\ ] ]    the purpose of this note is to present a simple geometric diagram ( figure 2 ) that allows one to visualize the poincar formula , and to perform the addition in a purely geometrical way .        in the figure , velocities are represented as points @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the real line @xmath5 .",
    "the line is embedded in @xmath6 and the unit circle at the origin is added .",
    "each velocity determines a point on the circle : namely the intersection points with the line from @xmath7 through @xmath0 , and with the line from @xmath8 through @xmath1 ( or vice versa ) .",
    "the point on @xmath9 that belongs to the line joining the two points just constructed represents the relativistic composition @xmath10 .",
    "* proof : * let a and b be the points on the circle determined by velocities @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( for economy , @xmath0 and @xmath1 denote both points on @xmath5 and the corresponding values ) .",
    "first , we find their coordinates @xmath11 .",
    "the result , presented in the fig .  3 , may be obtained as follows .",
    "use similarity of triangles @xmath12 and @xmath13 to determine the coordinate value @xmath14 of point @xmath15 : @xmath16 squaring the above expression gives : @xmath17 from which one readily extracts @xmath18 : @xmath19 applying this to ( [ eq : ratio ] ) one gets @xmath20 the coordinates for point @xmath21 follow from symmetry . with these two points , @xmath15 and @xmath21 , in hand , one constructs the line through them : @xmath22    now , by substituting @xmath23 , we get the point of intersection with the horizontal axis : @xmath24 which proves the theorem .",
    "the diagrammatic interpretation allows one to visualize basic algebraic features of the relativistic addition formula .",
    "a few situations are shown in fig .",
    "some extreme cases are illustrated in the bottom row .",
    "an interactive applet for more explorations may be found on the author s web page @xcite ( one can examine there what happens in the  forbidden \" case of @xmath26 ) .",
    "one of the speculative theories of physics is the existence of tachyons , hypothetical particles that move faster than light.@xcite according to the theory , one of its counterintuitive properties is that , unlike ordinary particles , a tachyon slows down as its energy increases .",
    "tachyons are forbidden from slowing down below the speed of light , as regular matter can not speed up above this barrier .",
    "( in both cases infinite energy would be required to reach the speed of light from either side ) .",
    "one can see this with the aid of our diagram ( see fig .",
    "5 ) : adding a small velocity to a tachyon slows it down . and subtracting  speeds it up !        we leave it to the reader to draw a diagram showing that adding two tachyonic velocities would result a subluminal speed , normal for the common matter .",
    "the poincar formula is similar to the addition formula for tangents in regular trigonometry : @xmath27 for economy , we use the same symbol @xmath28 to denote the tangent addition .",
    "figure 6 shows how one may adjust the previous idea to the trigonometric case  namely , the regular circle must be replaced by a  hyperbolic circle \" .",
    "figures 7 and 8 show a few examples .",
    "it is intriguing if not paradoxical that one needs a circle to make a construction for hyperbolic geometry and a hyperbola for the geometry of circle ...        the last comment is about the analogy between the trigonometric tangent and its hyperbolic version .",
    "actually , one may continuously deform one into the other .",
    "deform the circle in figure 1 into an ellipse through points @xmath29 and with a wider horizontal size while maintaining the geometrically defined addition .",
    "eventually the ellipse turns into a pair of parallel lines , @xmath30 for which the geometric addition coincides with regular arithmetic addition . increasing further the eccentricity will result in the hyperbolic case .",
    "the transformation may be executed by changing continuously the value of @xmath0 from @xmath31 to @xmath32 in the quadratic @xmath33 .",
    "the relativistic velocity addition formula first appears in the letter of poincar to lorentz , roughly in may 1905 , and was presented to the french academy of science in 6 june of the same year .",
    "basic ingredients of relativity principle were presented by poincar at the world scientific conference in st louis in september 1904 .",
    "poincar also noted that the expression @xmath34 defines a relativistic invariant .",
    "although he used 4-vectors , poincar did not pursue the geometric consequences .",
    "it was hermann minkowski who followed up on this idea in 1907 .",
    "albert einstein decisively removed the concept of ether and simplified the derivation of lorenz transformation rules in 1905 . for more on history of relativity",
