    "the module ` alkali_atom_data ` defines an explicit class for each alkali element ( e.g. ` rubidium(),ceasium ( ) ` ) that encodes all relevant physical parameters and inherits the calculation methods from the parent ` alkaliatom ` class .",

    "we will outline the basic functionality of the arc module , providing the theoretical framework for the various modules and providing examples of relevant calculations implemented in the library .",
    "almost all calculated quantities in the arc library can be derived from knowledge of the rydberg state energy levels and matrix elements . the functions to calculate these values along with other primitive single - atom properties",

    "[ sec : interactions ] , the finite pair - state energy defects @xmath133 associated with the closest dipole - coupled pair - states lead to a transition from first order resonant dipole - dipole interactions ( @xmath170 ) to second order van der waals ( @xmath171 ) at the van der waals radius . using external electric fields however , it is possible to stark shift the pair - states into resonance to obtain long - range @xmath170 interactions for all values of @xmath119 , known as a frster resonance @xcite .    to identify suitable frster resonances the ` starkmapresonances ` class",

    "due to the angular momentum selection rules of the dipole operator @xmath123 , the target pair - state can be dipole - coupled to pair - states with @xmath172 , it is necessary to calculate stark maps for a range of @xmath173 manifolds . following diagonalisation ,",
    "only pair - states with energy close to the target state are considered , with any states not dipole - coupled to the target pair - state being discarded .",
    "as the electric field coupling leads to significant mixing of the zero - field pair - states , the algorithm identifies the basis state containing the largest target state fraction at a given electric field to test for the closest dipole - coupled pair - states . finally , an interactive plot routine enables users to identify states that have a frster resonance .",
    "note , unlike the previous class , ` starkmapresonances ` accepts two atom classes at initialisation making it possible to determine inter - species resonances .",

    "it is assumed the the pre - requisites ( numpy , scipy and matplotlib ) are installed and can be located by python interpreter ( see e.g. @xcite ) . to achieve good performance ,",
    "it is recommended to use numpy packages that connect to optimised backends , like atlas @xcite .",
    "prepackaged python distributions , like anaconda @xcite , provide this out - of - the box .",
    "the arc library can be downloaded online @xcite as a zip file named ` arc.zip ` .",
    "installation is performed by extracting the ` arc ` folder and copying into the root of your project directory .",
    "it is important that python has write access to the folder where the package is located , so that database files and temporary files can be updated and used . to initialise the library ,",
    "use the following code at the start of a python script or interactive ipython notebook with    .... # locate arc directory import sys , os rootdir = ' /path / to / root / directory / for / arc ' sys.path.append(rootdir ) os.chdir(rootdir ) # import arc library from arc import * ....    this firsts sets a path to the directory containing arc package directory on your computer .",
    "this is recommended way of using the package in research environment , since users can easily access , check and change the underlying code and constants according to their needs .",
    "arc is now ready for use , and can be tested using the example code above .",
    "numerous additional examples are provided in ipython notebook `` an introduction to rydberg atoms with arc ''  @xcite .",
    "integration of the atomic wavefunctions to obtain dipole matrix elements is numerically intensive and by default ` arc ` uses an optimised numerov integration routine implemented in c++ . in the unlikely case the precompiled executable ` nvwcpp `",
    "is incompatible with the installed system , please install a c++ compiler and compile ` nvwcpp.cpp ` located in the arc root folder using ( example shows call for gnu c++ compiler )    .... g++ -o3 nvwcpp.cpp -o nvwcpp ....    alternatively , the native python solver can be used by setting the optional argument ` cpp_numerov = false ` when initialising the atom class , however this is not recommended for intensive calculations as it results in substantially slower execution .",
    "as mentioned above , the atomic properties are encapsulated in classes which contain the relevant atomic properties determined from the literature along with model potential coefficients taken from marinescu et al .",
    "@xcite which have been optimised against measured energy levels . for each atom ,",
    "asymptotic expansions of the quantum defects are used to determine the energy levels of states with high principal quantum number to high accuracy , using measured values the ionisation energy , rydberg constant and quantum defects taken from li  @xcite , na  @xcite , k  @xcite , rb @xcite , and cs @xcite . for",

    "most functions ( see documentation  @xcite for details ) provide optional ` bool ` arguments , that turn on printing of additional information about calculations .",
    "for example , ` progressoutput ` prints basic status information , and is recommended for everyday use . if ` debugoutput ` is set to ` true ` , more verbose information about basis states and couplings will be printed in the standard output .      in order to achieve good performance ,",
    "memoization is used throughout .",
    "that is , when functions receive request for calculation , memorised previous results are checked , and the value is retrieved from memory if it already exists .",
    "both in - application sql database ( sqlite ) and standard arrays are used for this .",
    "memoization is used for dipole and quadrupole matrix element calculations and all sorts of angular coupling factors , that are independent of principal quantum number of the considered state , including wigner-@xmath1j coefficients and wignerd matrices .",
    "single - atom and pair - state calculations automatically will update databases if new values are encountered , speeding up the future calculations .",
    "updating dipole and quadrupole matrix element database can be done manually too , by calling ` updatedipolematrixelementsfile ` .",
    "large self - contained calculations , such as stark maps or pair - state interaction potentials , are wrapped as classes to enable easy access to the calculations parameters , with associated visualisation and exploration methods to make the results easy to disseminate .",
    "an added benefit is that calculations can be saved for future use , as illustrated in the example below :    .... calc = pairstateinteractions(rubidium ( ) ,                             60,0,0.5,60,0,0.5 , 0.5,0.5 ) # do something with initialized calculation calc.definebasis(0,0 , 5,5 , 25.e9 ) calc.diagonalise(np.linspace(0.5,10.0,200),150 )    ....    this calculation can then be retrieved at a later time , or even on another machine , and continued , or further explored . for example :    .... calc = |\\textbf{loadsavedcalculation}|(\"mycalculation.pkl \" ) # continue calculation calc.plotleveldiagram ( ) calc.showplot ( ) ....      if one wants to use the obtained results in another program , for further analysis and calculation , both ` pairstateinteractions ` and ` starkmap ` provide ` exportdata ` method that allows saving data in .csv format , that is human - readable and easy to import in other software tools . as a commented header of the exported files ,",
    "program will record details of the performed calculations , in human - readable form .",
    "provided that initial calculation is variable ` calc ` , its data is exported by calling    .... calc.exportdata(\"rootfilename \" ) ....    the program will output list of files ( typically three files ) storing the calculation data , whose names will be starting with`\"rootfilename \" ` .",
    "this paper describes version 1.0 of arc that can be downloaded from  @xcite .",

    "this notebook provides both good introduction to most of the capabilities of the arc , as well as good starting point for users , providing useful code snippets .",
    "in addition , for quick estimates , when one is in the lab , conference or other meeting , we provide web - interface to the package  @xcite .",
    "for latest versions of the package and documents , please download material from the arc website  @xcite .    in the future",

    "these can be added as calculation tools , in separate classes , built on top of the existing library .",
    "alkaline earth elements can be included too .",
    "while these were beyond the scope of the current project , we hope that this project can provide an initial seed for a much bigger community project .",
    "the code is hosted on github  @xcite , allowing easy community involvement and improvements .",
    "a proposal of some basic philosophy for the development is provided in documentation  @xcite .",
    "we hope the library will increase accessibility to the existing knowledge . up to now a lot of relevant information , although in principle derivable from existing literature , required quite lengthy and error - prone calculations .",
    "the developed hierarchical object - oriented structure allows one to retrieve relevant information at the appropriate level of abstraction , without the need to deal with lower - level details .",
    "in addition , we hope to establish growing code base for common calculations , in the spirit of other open - source community projects like , numpy and scipy  @xcite , adding to the growing stack of atomic physics tools like elecsus  @xcite , the software atom  @xcite and qutip  @xcite .",
    "we especially highlight recent related development of c++ program pairinteraction for pair - state calculations  @xcite .",
    "we hope that this efforts will allow more research groups to explore the rich physics achievable when one uses all the available transitions in the atoms .",
    "in addition to exploring rydberg physics , library can be useful for practical exploration of multi - photon schemes for alkali - atoms excitation  @xcite , ionization  @xcite and upconversion  @xcite , as well as state control , e.g. through dressing of the intermediate levels  @xcite and adiabatic transfers  @xcite .",
