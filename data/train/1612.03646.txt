    "it is now widely believed that the essential physics of strongly correlated lattice electrons is encoded in the local constraint of no double electron occupancy .",
    "this constraint prohibits double electron occupancy of a lattice site due to the large local coulomb repulsion between hopping electrons .",
    "the on - site hilbert space is thus restricted to states with at most one electron per site ( hard - core fermions ) .",
    "such a modification of the underlying hilbert space results in dramatic consequences for the low - energy properties of the relevant electron systems revealing a rich and unusual physics in this limit .",
    "the strong electron correlations are at work to full extent in the nagaoka ( @xmath0 ) limit of the hubbard model .",
    "indeed , in this case an infinitely strong coulomb repulsion strictly prohibits the double electron occupancy of the lattice sites , and the no double occupancy ( ndo ) constraint becomes of the utmost importance . in the infinite @xmath3 limit",
    ", the hubbard hamiltonian reduces to @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a symmetric matrix whose elements represent the hopping amplitude @xmath6 between the nearest - neighbour sites and are zero otherwise . despite its seemingly simple form",
    ", this hamiltonian can not be diagonalized due to the fact that the projected electron operators @xmath7 fulfil complicated commutation relations resulting from the explicit manifestation of strong correlations .",
    "the physics behind the model ( [ 1.1 ] ) is certainly far from trivial .",
    "indeed , nagaoka @xcite proved a theorem stating that for one hole the ground state of the @xmath0 hubbard model is a fully saturated ferromagnet .",
    "this provides an interesting example of a quantum system in which ferromagnetism appears as a purely kinetic energy effect with hole hoping ( itinerant ferromagnetism ) emerging as a result of the strong correlations from the ndo constraint .",
    "unfortunately , despite extensive work over many years , this model and itinerant ferromagnetism are still poorly understood .",
    "one of the important questions to be addressed concerns the thermodynamic stability of the nagaoka phase .",
    "that is , whether or not the nagaoka state is stable when the density of holes is finite in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "there are arguments both for @xcite and against @xcite the thermodynamic stability of the nagaoka phase and comparisons between various approaches have been made carefully ( for a recent example , see @xcite ) .",
    "the basic problem that prevents one from reaching a definite conclusion on that is the large-@xmath3 limit or , equivalently , the local ndo constraint which is very difficult to deal with in a controlled way .",
    "analytical approaches basically imply a mean - field ( mf ) treatment in which the local ndo constraint is uncontrollably replaced by a global condition .",
    "for example , the standard slave fermion ( sf ) mf theory which treats the ndo constraint only on average is known to predict a stable fm phase for the @xmath0 hubbard model over an unphysically large doping range .",
    "it was however shown that the sf mf approach produces spurious results and is therefore not reliable for the description of the nagaoka ferromagnetism.@xcite    available variational approaches @xcite show that variational estimations that involve more realistic refined trial wave - functions result in a smaller value of the critical hole concentration . in case",
    "a mean - field treatment provides an exact result , i.e. , in infinite spatial dimensions , the fully polarized fm ground state is never stable.@xcite one might therefore think that a proper treatment of the ndo constraint could improve the mf results shifting the critical hole concentrations towards progressively smaller values .",
    "numerical studies of the hubbard model can not directly incorporate the large-@xmath3 limit @xcite .",
    "it should be more useful to construct first an effective hamiltonian , valid to some order in @xmath8 , to be studied directly by numerical simulations . for large values of the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath3 and a fixed value of the hopping amplitude @xmath9",
    ", the hubbard hamiltonian allows for the expansion in powers of a small parameter @xmath10 .",
    "the truncated expansion takes the form @xmath11 the spin - exchange term @xmath12 with @xmath13 being the electron spin operator and @xmath14 the pauli vector .",
    "this asymptotic form is refereed to as the @xmath15 model of strongly correlated electrons , with @xmath16 being the spin - exchange coupling constant .",
    "the hopping term , @xmath17 appears as a bilinear form of the projected electron operators @xmath18 given by eq.([1.1 ] ) .",
    "these operators differ drastically from the conventional fermion operators especially in the most interesting region close to half filling , which poses a serious problem in performing reliable numerical computations .",
    "it is clear that strong correlations are controlled by a small global parameter @xmath19 .",
    "the extreme case of strong correlations  the nagaoka limit of the hubbard model",
    " implies @xmath20 .",
    "the opposite case of large @xmath21 formally corresponds to weakly correlated electrons , as it implies @xmath22 .",
    "it is , of course , inappropriate to consider the @xmath15 model at large values of @xmath21 as a strong coupling limit of the hubbard model .",
    "however one can instead consider the couplings @xmath9 and @xmath21 as being _",
    "independent _ phenomenological parameters althgough they are no longer hubbard model parameters .",
    "this opens up a route to include into consideration a new interesting physics .",
    "for example , the phenomenological @xmath15 model displays different types of phase separation depending on the value of @xmath23 .",
    "there are at least two physically interesting regimes that are controlled by small parameters @xmath24 and @xmath23 , respectively . in the first case",
    ", a hole develops a spin polaron . within this polaron",
    ", the afm order is suppressed by hole hoping . in the second case , the nagaoka ( fm ) polaron",
    "is developed , which implies that not only the afm order is destroyed , but also the fm correlations are developed in the vicinity of a hole . @xcite .",
    "strong correlations in the phenomenological @xmath15 model are implemented by the substitution @xmath25 that affects only the hopping term . for calculation purposes",
    ", it would be desirable to represent such a substitution through a certain interaction between the relevant unconstrained degrees of freedom .",
    "this provides an extra parameter to control the strength of the correlations .",
    "this can be achieved by employing the earlier established mapping of the @xmath15 model of strongly correlated electrons onto the itinerant - localized kondo - heisenberg model at a dominantly large kondo coupling , @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "such a model provides a convenient new set of the unconstrained localized and itinerant coordinates well suited for numerical simulations .",
    "right at the point @xmath27 the proposed kondo - heisenberg model is equivalent to the standard @xmath15 model of strongly correlated electrons . away from that point",
    ", the kondo - heisenberg model describes a phenomenological @xmath15 model in which the strength of the correlation is controlled by @xmath26 .    specifically , the @xmath0 hubbard model ( [ 1.1 ] ) is equivalent to the lattice kondo model at infinitely strong coupling , @xmath28 : @xcite @xmath29 here the localized electron is represented by the lattice spin operator @xmath30 whereas the itinerant doped hole ( dopon ) is described by a conventional fermionic mode , @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the dopon spin operator .",

    "a fully polarized state is never a ground state .",
    "our results coincide exactly with those obtained by other methods .",
    "@xcite    on the other hand , for hard - core spinful bosons , the ground state appears as a fully polarized state at any number of holes .",
    "this agrees @xcite with the statement exactly proven elsewhere that , for spinful bosons , the hard - core ferromagnetism is stable for _ all _ hole densities.@xcite    another interesting issue to address concerns the character of a possible associated quantum phase transition .",
    "let us assume that there is a thermodynamically stable fully polarized state at finite doping in the region of @xmath52 is then a leading instability of this phase continuous to imply that it occurs gradually , through small @xmath53 changes in the total spin ? or instead ,",
    "such a transition is discontinuous , meaning a large abrupt change in the total spin @xmath54 ?",
    "the results of the exact diagonalization of the small clusters displayed in fig.[sg ] indicate that a transition from the nagaoka state to that with two holes always occurs through an abrupt spin change that increases with the lattice size .",
    "in particular , the results presented in the panel ( a ) tell us that @xmath55 , whereas those for the panel ( d ) indicate that @xmath56 this therefore seems to indicate at first sight that the breakdown of the nagaoka phase at @xmath57 is of a discontinuous type .",
    "however , the `` oscillation '' character of the curves displayed in fig . 2 show that , at larger number of holes , @xmath58 , there are in fact transitions with @xmath53 or even @xmath59 .",
    "it is not therefore clear what type of transitions actually survives in the thermodynamic limit . in any event , the finite cluster calculations displayed in fig.[sg ] do not support the statement that the destruction of the nagaoka state is necessarily accompanied by an abrupt change of the total spin .",
    "the exact small - cluster diagonalization can also be used to compute the spin - spin correlations @xmath60 between nearest - neighbour sites .",
    "figure [ gr ] shows these correlations computed on the same clusters as those depicted in the fig.2 . in the hard - core boson case ,",
    "the correlation functions are purely ferromagnetic and scale as @xmath61 .",
    "this clearly corresponds to the fully polarized states . for the hard - core fermions , however",
    ", the correlations do not reveal any fm magnetic order except for the one - hole case , where the correlations coincide with those in the hard - core boson case .",
    "in the fermionic case , a sort of afm order builds up instead , with a magnitude of the correlations decreasing with the total lattice size . in the next section",
    ", we confirm this result by qmc calculations for larger lattice clusters .",
    "an alternative approach is based on a computation of spin - spin correlation functions by employing the qmc algorithm . in this way , one can estimate a magnetic correlation length in the asymptotic regime , @xmath62 . in case",
    "this quantity shows no appreciable dependence on finite - size effects , one may draw certain reliable conclusions on a character of the underlying magnetic order .",
    "one must however take a proper care of the fact that we are dealing with a strong - coupling problem .",
    "namely , since we are interested in the large @xmath26 limit , it seems appropriate to separate the hamiltonian ( [ 1.2 ] ) in the following way : @xmath63 where the leading term is now @xmath64 and the `` interaction '' term is @xmath65 to compute the spin correlators we adopt the continuous time worldline ( ctwl ) qmc algorithm based on the representation of the partition function in the interaction picture : @xmath66 where @xmath67 stands for the @xmath68-ordering operator , and the partition function @xmath69 all the necessary details for the ctwl qmc algorithm to be applied to treat the lattice kondo - heisenberg model can be found in a recent paper published elsewhere .",

    "in conclusion , the lack of a clear sign of fm short - range spin correlations in the parameter range studied in our work provides strong arguments against thermodynamic stability of the nagaoka phase at least for the hole concentrations @xmath1 it is very likely to conclude that the critical hole concentration is in fact equal to zero .",
    "this is a quite natural conclusion as the only parameter in the nagaoka problem ( [ 1.1 ] ) is an overall dimensional coupling constant , @xmath9 .",
    "varying it simply amounts to changing a scale of units of measuring energy .",
    "the critical hole concentration can not depend on such a rescaling .",
    "since there are no other dimensionful parameters in the problem , there are actually only two acceptable options in the thermodynamic limit , namely , either the fm order does not exist at all , which is the case for the hard - core fermions , or it is realized at all possible hole densities .",
