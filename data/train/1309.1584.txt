    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars represent the later evolutionary stages of massive stars ( single or in binaries ) with initial main sequence masses larger than @xmath2 .",
    "the exact evolutionary paths for such high mass stars are not well established and there are several possibilities depending on various factors such as initial mass , rotation rate and magnetic field ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for a recent overview of the situation .",
    "clearly , better statistical information covering a range of stellar parameters can help in the understanding of likely evolutionary scenarios for very massive stars . in the last 10 years or",
    "so the number of known wr stars has more than doubled @xcite , with more than 430 galactic wr stars now known .",
    "this article reports on early , previously unreported , work in identifying wr stars in the galaxy .",
    "the strong winds and significant mass loss of wr stars lead to a power - law spectrum excess from the wind with spectral index of 2.7 to 3.2 which is in addition to the photospheric emission @xcite .",
    "this becomes particularly notable in the near- to mid - infrared ( see for more details * ? ? ?",
    "the spitzer / glimpse survey of the galactic plane at galactic latitudes @xmath3 provides infrared fluxes for tens of millions of sources in the wavelength range 3.8@xmath0 m to 8@xmath0 m benjamin03 .",
    "the 2mass survey covers the whole sky at the near - infrared jhk@xmath4 wavebands .",
    "combining glimpse and 2mass colours allows a colour - colour diagram of sources where wr stars are in a clearly defined colour space containing a relatively low percentage of objects ( figure  [ fig : ccdiag ] ) .",
    "the reddening vector shows that wr stars remain in a clearly distinguishable region of the colour - colour diagram .         in the initial pilot project reported here",
    ", candidates were chosen from a 2@xmath5 region around rcw  49 and a relatively random region of the galaxy around a galactic latitude of @xmath6 .",
    "these were followed up with spectra taken with the sofi instrument on board the new technology telescope ( ntt ) on la silla , chile , effectively covering the 1.8 to 2.5 @xmath0 m spectral range in june 2005 .",
    "this covers a number diagnostic h , he and c line wavelengths for identifying wn and wc subtypes of wr stars .",
    "since only spectral line diagnostics were needed , flux calibration was not required and weather conditions were variable . further optical spectroscopy followup was performed on the ctio 4 m blanco telescope using the rc spectrometer in march 2006 .",
    "our spectral follow - up revealed a @xmath7% success rate for finding wr stars .",
    "a total of 6 new wr stars were found from 42 candidate stars viewed .",
    "four of these new wr stars were found away from the westerlund 2 cluster / rcw49 field while two further wr stars were found in the rcw49 region outer regions .",
    "these include 2 wc stars and 4 wn stars , including the new wn10 star g321.0331 - 00.4274 ( see figure  [ fig : wn10 ] ) .    in total , 80% of stars showed emission lines . most of these are be ( or sometimes o ) stars .",
    "examples are shown in fig.a1 of @xcite where the h and k band spectra are dominated by hi emission lines .",
    "later work has improved the colour selection criterion of the method used here @xcite and a significant number of candidates are still to be looked at .",
    "@xcite have presented the discovery sofi infrared spectra of 5 of the 6 wr stars discovered in this study using sofi archival data .",
    "these are referred to as wr20aa , wr20c , wr60aa , wr67a , and wr67b . identifying wr star candidates via their infrared colours",
    "has since been improved @xcite .",
    "one of the curious aspects of this work  as has also been seen in the further studies of @xcite and @xcite  is the fact that as many newly discovered wr stars are found well away from dense star clusters as associated with them . since their lives are so short many of these objects may be formed _ in situ _ or very near by .",
    "alternately , there is a large fraction of wr stars forming a population of fast moving , runaway stars in the galaxy .",
    "something that may well be resolved by upcoming gaia observations .",

    "<S> determining the galactic distribution and numbers of massive stars , such as wolf - rayet stars ( wrs ) , is hampered by intervening galactic or local circumstellar dust obscuration . in order to probe such regions of the galaxy we can use infrared observations , which provide a means for finding such hidden populations through the dust . </S>",
    "<S> the availability of both 2mass and spitzer / glimpse large - scale survey data provides infrared colours from 1.25 to 8@xmath0 m for a large fraction of the inner galactic plane . in 2005 </S>",
    "<S> we initiated a pilot study of the combined set of infrared colours for two glimpse fields and showed that wrs typically occupy a sparsely populated region of the colour space . </S>",
    "<S> we followed up 42 of our wr candidates spectroscopically in the near - infrared , and with limited additional observations of some of these candidates in the optical . </S>",
    "<S> six new wrs , four late - type wn and two late - type wc stars , were discovered as a result . of the remaining @xmath186% of the sample , </S>",
    "<S> five appear to be o - type stars . </S>",
    "<S> 21 stars are likely of type be , and 10 stars appear to be of late - type , or possibly young stellar objects , which have `` contaminated '' the infrared color space . </S>",
    "<S> the survey is generally unbiased towards clusters or field stars , and the new wrs found are in both the field and in and around the rcw 49 region ( including cluster westerlund 2 ) . in this work , and in our other recent work , we show that the infrared broad - band colours to be the most efficient means of identifying ( particularly , dust - obscured ) candidate massive stars , notably wrs . </S>"
