    "<S> the effective theory for bilayer graphene ( blg ) , subject to parallel / in - plane magnetic fields , is derived . with a sizable magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> the trigonal warping becomes irrelevant , and one ends up with two dirac points in the vicinity of each valley in the low - energy limit , similar to the twisted blg . combining twisting and parallel field thus gives rise to a dirac system with tunable fermi velocity and cutoff . </S>",

    "<S> two well studied members of this new class of materials are single - layer and bilayer graphene . despite the fascinating potential of exhibiting various ordered phases@xcite and related quantum critical phenomena@xcite , the dirac points of monolayer graphene are remarkably stable due to a large quasi - particle fermi velocity ( @xmath0 ) ; thus far , ordered phases have only been realized in the presence of ( perpendicular ) magnetic fields@xcite . in this </S>",
    "<S> regard , bilayer blg appears to be propitious , and has already exhibited phenomena strongly suggestive of spontaneous symmetry breaking@xcite , possibly realizing a subset of all the possible ordered states available for the fermion to condense into@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but the role of the mesoscopic environment , such as gate configuration , substrate etc . , on the nature of the ordered states still lacks a clear understanding@xcite . as a result , realization of several interesting ordered states and tuning this system across ( quantum ) phase transitions are still among future prospects . </S>",
    "<S> we here propose that blg , when immersed in parallel magnetic fields and twisted@xcite , yields a unique opportunity to explore some of these interesting possibilities .    </S>",
    "<S> pristine blg is well described by a two - band model , with quadratic touching of the valence and the conduction bands . </S>",
    "<S> subject to in - plane magnetic fields , each parabolic band touching ( pbt ) in blg splits into _ two _ dirac cones@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar scenario also arises when blg is twisted , if the twisting is commensurate@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , such twofold splitting competes with the trigonal warping ( tw)@xcite , which , on the other hand , breaks each pbt into _ four _ dirac cones@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we here show that when a sufficiently strong in - plane field is applied , one ends up with only two dirac cones ; this happens within accessible magnetic field strength when the field is applied along certain optimal directions ( see fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the field / twisting controls the fermi velocity of the resultant dirac points , and thus the ( effective ) interaction strength ; this allows us to tune the system across various transitions between the weak - coupling phase ( where interactions are irrelevant@xcite ) to various ordered phases . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , these setups admit additional fully gapped phases that do not have any analogy in either single - layer graphene or pristine blg . when a perpendicular magnetic field is present@xcite , even a richer set of new ordered phases may be realized .    </S>",
    "<S> recently there has been a surge of theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite activities in twisted blg ( mostly focusing on single - particle physics thus far ) , while blg with in - plane field has attracted little attention thus far@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the motivations of the present work is to point out their similarity , and more importantly the fact that they are complementary to each other : twisting gives rise to a larger effects and does not couple to electron spin , but is discrete . </S>",
    "<S> in - plane field has a weaker effect and couples to electron spin as well , but can be tuned continuously , a virtue important for exploring critical phenomena . </S>",

    "<S> we now consider driving the dirac semi - metal across the laf transition by tuning a parallel magnetic field , in the presence of twisting . in that situation </S>",
    "<S> the universal behavior in the vicinity of the laf transition will be governed by an @xmath161 gny theory , due to the zeeman coupling . </S>",
    "<S> however , such quantum critical behavior can only be probed at a temperature @xmath184 . </S>",
    "<S> the effective theory is similar to the one in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ o3gny ] ) , with @xmath170 as a two - component bosonic field , and @xmath185 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar @xmath161 gny theory also describes the quantum superconducting transition of the dirac fermions in graphene and on the surface of topological insulators@xcite , and in - plane field driven transition to any other triplet ordering in twisted blg . </S>",
    "<S> various critical exponents near this transition are different from the previous ones and read as @xmath186 , @xmath187 , and @xmath188.@xcite    as a consequence of the restoration of relativistic invariance at the gny critical point , i.e. @xmath164 , the bosonic velocity approaches the the fermionic velocity ( @xmath70 ) ( non - universal ) , and consequently the ratio of the specific heats inside the semi - matallic and insulating side within the critical region also approaches universal value @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the number of gapless fermionic modes , and @xmath191 is the number of massless goldstone modes in the broken - symmetry phase , which is therefore respectively @xmath136 and @xmath192 in the twisting and the zeeman - driven laf phase .    in the same framework , we can also address the quantum critical behavior of a @xmath193 symmetry breaking transition towards the lp ordering in twisted blg with @xcite @xmath194 the transition to a @xmath193 symmetry breaking ordering is governed by the critical point @xmath195 . </S>",
    "<S> the critical exponents near this critical point are @xmath196 , @xmath197 , and @xmath198@xcite . at @xmath104 , however , there is a first order phase transition from the lp to the @xmath161 laf state , which also carries a finite ferromagnetic moment , if one applies a weak in - plane field .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we propose a possible way to realize some of the new masses , which lack any analogy in the pristine blg . in the vicinity of the neutrality point </S>",
    "<S> , we believe that the leading instabilities will likely be similar to those in regular blg , when it is slightly twisted and placed in weak parallel fields . on the other hand , upon tilting the magnetic field out of the blg plane , one can develop a set of landau levels ( lls ) at energies @xmath199 , where @xmath200 and @xmath201 is the field s perpendicular component . </S>",
    "<S> relativistic lls can also be developed by placing the twisted blg in perpendicular magnetic fields . the twofold _ </S>",
    "<S> orbital degeneracy _ of the zeroth ll in pristine blg@xcite , translates into the _ flavor degeneracy _ when blg is twisted@xcite or when twisting and tilted fields are present simultaneously , which however , can not be lifted by any of the masses in pristine blg , e.g </S>",
    "<S> @xmath124 , @xmath202 , @xmath203@xcite , since they are flavor independent . </S>",
    "<S> if we consider spinless fermions for simplicity , and also neglect flavor and valley mixing , the flavor degeneracy of the zeroth ll can be lifted by @xmath204 or @xmath205 masses . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , by placing the chemical potential close to the first excited state within the zeroth ll , additional incompressible hall states at fillings @xmath206 can be developed by these new masses that we propose here.@xcite the single - particle gap of the @xmath207 hall states should scale linearly with the field , if the interaction is sufficiently weak . </S>",
    "<S> scaling then reverts to a sublinear one for moderate interaction strength ; and a perfect @xmath208 scaling emerges at zero - field criticality@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , different scaling regimes can be accessed in this system by tuning the twisting and/or in - plane field , which in turn controls the effective interaction strength . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analysis of the quantum hall physics for spinful fermions is quite rich , but left for future investigation .    </S>",
