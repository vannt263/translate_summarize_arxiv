    "the spectral theory for @xmath0-laplacian on graphs is an interesting object .",
    "it has been studied recently in @xcite etc .",
    "hein and bhler @xcite proposed a straightforward nonlinear generalization of the linear eigenvalue problem for the standard graph laplacian by defining the graph @xmath0-laplacian as @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 denotes vertex @xmath4 being adjacent to vertex @xmath5 , @xmath6 means the summation over all vertices adjacent to vertex @xmath5 , and @xmath7,&t=0 .",
    "\\end{cases}\\ ] ] in consequence , the corresponding @xmath0-laplacian eigenvalue problem is to solve a pair @xmath8 satisfying @xmath9 where the diagonal matrix @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the degree of the vertex @xmath5 , and @xmath12 .",
    "very recently , chang @xcite studied the same problem from a variational point of view and developed a critical point theory for the function @xmath13 on a piecewise linear manifold @xmath14 he proved that the euler equation of @xmath15 on @xmath16 is nothing but the system , which can be rewritten in the coordinate form as @xmath17 based on such solid foundation , the liusternik - schnirelmann theory was extended , provided both the function @xmath15 and the constraint @xmath16 being invariant under the transformation @xmath18 . by introducing the krasnoselski genus @xmath19 of a closed symmetric subset @xmath20 , a series of critical values are obtained @xcite : @xmath21 meanwhile , the liusternik - schnirelmann multiplicity theorem was also extended to @xmath22 , in which the topological multiplicity of an eigenvalue was defined via the genus .",
    "more interestingly , the relationship between eigenvalues and the cheeger constant for graphs was further revealed in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath23 be the cheeger constant of the graph @xmath24 , it was proved there that : @xmath25 and the mountain pass characterization of the cheeger constant were also obtained .",
    "actually , the cheeger constant can be characterized as a minimum of the function @xmath15 on a feasible subset @xmath26 ( see eq .  ) of @xmath16 . precisely , it was shown in @xcite that the feasible set @xmath26 is nothing but the set of vectors whose median is zero in @xmath16 ( @xcite , theorem 2.9 ) . combining with some other ideas like the relaxation , several efficient algorithms were introduced in numerical computations @xcite .",
    "further more , the nodal domain theorem ( @xcite , theorem 3.6 ) reveals the structure of eigenvectors for the graph @xmath0-laplacian .",
    "it implies that in most cases the set of eigenvectors of a given eigenvalue could be very huge , it appears as a union of cells .",
    "this huge set of eigenvectors makes trouble in numerical computations .",
    "this paper continues the study .",
    "a _ new feature _ of eigenvectors for the graph @xmath0-laplacian is discovered .",
    "the eigenvectors possess some sort of localization property : on one hand ( decomposition ) , any nodal domain of an eigenvector is again an eigenvector with the same eigenvalue ; on the other hand ( package ) , one can pack up an eigenvector for a new graph by several fundamental eigencomponents and modules with the same eigenvalue via several special techniques .",
    "section [ sec : package ] is devoted to this study .",
    "theorem [ th : equivalent - binary ] is on the decomposition , and the rest of this section is on the package of those components .",
    "special techniques , including extension , joining , pasting and plugging , are introduced .",
    "examples are provided in illustrating how to apply these techniques .",
    "based on theorem [ th : equivalent - binary ] , for any eigenvalue there must be a corresponding eigenvector with only one nodal domain . in this case , the notion on the largest number @xmath27 of nodal domains for an eigenvalue @xmath28 on graph @xmath24 is introduced ( see definition [ def : nu ] ) . with the aid of theorem [ th : equivalent - binary ] and those special techniques , we are able to calculate @xmath27 directly for three special graphs : path graphs @xmath29 , cycle graphs @xmath30 and complete graphs @xmath31 in section [ sec : pncnkn ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the results for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , stated in theorems [ th : nodal - pn ] and [ th : nodal - cn ] , respectively , induce the counterparts of the sturm - liouville oscillation theorem in ordinary differential equations ( ode ) , of the oscillatory eigenfunctions for @xmath0-laplacian on intervals and circles @xcite , as well as of the oscillatory eigenfunctions for standard laplacian on @xmath29 in the linear spectral graph theory @xcite .    to an eigenvector @xmath32 on a graph ,",
    "there are two kinds of nodal domains : the strong nodal domain and the weak nodal domain .",
    "they are denoted by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the courant nodal domain theorem has been extended to the standard linear laplacian on graphs @xcite .",
    "the extended version to the nonlinear laplacian asserts that @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is any eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the topological multiplicity of @xmath37 .",
    "this is theorem [ th : strong - nodal - domain ] .",
    "but for weak nodal domains there is no better estimate , see example [ exam:10g - weak - nodal ] .",
    "not like in the linear spectral theory that the eigenvector of the first nonzero eigenvalue must be changing sign , example [ exam:5g - one - nodal ] provides a graph with @xmath39 for the graph @xmath0-laplacian .",
    "we also give the condition under which @xmath40 , see theorem [ th : simple - c2 ] .",
    "the @xmath41-way cheeger constant is usually defined to be @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a set of disjoint subsets of @xmath44 .",
    "it is motivated by the multi - way spectral partition , see @xcite for instance .",
    "recently , the relationship between the higher - order eigenvalue @xmath45 of the standard graph laplacian and @xmath46 has been obtained @xcite . in theorem",
    "[ th : ckhk ] , on one hand , we provide an estimate from below : @xmath47 for the graph @xmath0-laplacian ; on the other hand , with the aid of nodal domains , we obtain an estimate from above : @xmath48 , if @xmath49 .",
    "the details are delineated in sections [ sec : nodal - domain ] and [ sec : k - way - cheeger ] .    in the rest of this paper",
    ", we study several related topics .",
    "there are two groups of eigenvalues , one by solutions @xmath50 of the system with natural order , another by @xmath51 via the minimax principle .",
    "it was then asked @xcite : _ is there any eigenvalue @xmath28 , which is not in the sequence : @xmath51 ? _ section [ sec : example ] gives a positive answer .",
    "so far , the multiplicity of an eigenvalue @xmath52 means the topological multiplicity , i.e. , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the critical set with critical value @xmath52 .",
    "algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue is introduced in section [ sec : algebra ] in order to provide a more precise estimate of the number of independent eigenvectors .",
    "theorems [ th : algebra - nodal ] and [ th : algebra - span - eigenvector ] provide an estimate from below via nodal domains and an equivalent characterization of the algebraic multiplicity , respectively .    as we mentioned",
    ", the critical set @xmath54 could be very huge , in a concrete problem , it is natural to ask : _ how to choose a suitable eigenvector in @xmath55 ? _ in the last section , from the realistic purpose in finding the cheeger cut to divide a graph into two parts as equally as possible , we introduce the notion of optimal cheeger cut via nodal domains in section [ sec : optimal ] .",
    "we wish this will be helpful in clarifying the results in numerical computations .",
    "the eigenvectors of the @xmath0-laplacian possess a special property : in some sense , it can be localized .",
    "it makes us possible to develop some special techniques in dealing with the eigenvalue problem for the graph @xmath0-laplacian .",
    "this section is divided into two parts . in the first part",
    ", we observe a _ new phenomenon _ that any one of the nodal domains of an eigenvector for the @xmath0-laplacian is again an eigenvector with the same eigenvalue ( see theorem [ th : equivalent - binary ] ) .",
    "accordingly , any eigenvector for the @xmath0-laplacian can be decomposed into several fundamental eigenvectors with single nodal domain . in the second part",
    ", we introduce the notions of module and eigencomponent and provide some special techniques to put them together , resulting a new eigenvector .      in the following",
    "we always assume that eigenvectors and eigenvalues are with respect to @xmath56 defined in eq .   on an un - oriented connected graph @xmath57 .",
    "the set of all eigenvectors , i.e. , all solutions of the system , is denoted by @xmath58 .    for a vector @xmath59 with @xmath60 , according to the signatures of @xmath61 , we classify the vertices into three groups : @xmath62 we call @xmath63 the null set of @xmath64 , and the vertex set of a connected component of the subgraph induced by @xmath65 is called a @xmath66 nodal domain .",
    "accordingly , we divide @xmath44 into @xmath67 disjoint @xmath66 nodal domains plus the null set : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a @xmath66 nodal domain and @xmath70 is the number of @xmath66 nodal domains .",
    "assume that an eigenvector @xmath71 , has the following nodal domain decomposition @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the cartesian basis of @xmath74 .",

    "since @xmath64 is an eigenvector , according to theorem 3.11 in @xcite , we have @xmath111 which implies @xmath112 . but",
    "@xmath113 , therefore @xmath114 the proof is finished .",
    "the new finding presented in theorem [ th : equivalent - binary ] serves as not only the jumping - off place but also the core foundation of the present study , which reflects in at least three aspects below .    1 .",
    "it provides a systematic way of computing all eigenvalues of the graph @xmath0-laplacian by investigating only the vectors with single nodal domain . in this view",
    ", we obtain the entire spectrum of the complete graph @xmath31 ( see section [ sec : kn ] ) and all the eigenvalues of @xmath0-laplacian for the graph in example [ fig : counterexample ] ( see section [ sec : example ] ) .",
    "2 .   besides the topological multiplicity ( via genus ) of an eigenvalue , the notion of algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue is derived from theorem [ th : equivalent - binary ] ( see section [ sec : algebra ] ) . in particular",
    ", there may be many cheeger cuts ( i.e. , binary eigenvectors corresponding to the second eigenvalue ) , and this leads us to introduce the optimal cheeger cut ( see section [ sec : optimal ] ) .",
    "3 .   the localization property of eigenvectors gives us an opportunity to combine the eigenvectors with disjoint supports to form a new module for a larger graph .",
    "this guides us to consider the package ( see section [ subsec : package ] ) .",
    "further with the aid of several special techniques , we successfully compute the eigenvectors with the most possible nodal domains of path graphs @xmath29 as well as cycle graphs @xmath30 ( see section [ sec : pncnkn ] ) .",
    "conversely , we can put together some pieces of small graphs with the same prescribing eigenvalue @xmath28 .",
