    "simulations of hierarchical galaxy formation in a cdm universe ( kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ; cole et  al .",
    "1994 ) are based on semi - analytic models in the framework of press - schechter theory .",
    "they aim to describe the formation of galaxies in a cosmological context , and therefore are designed to match a number of constraints like @xmath1 and @xmath2 luminosity functions , the tully - fisher relation , redshift distribution , and slope and scatter of the colour - magnitude relation ( cmr ) .",
    "since in a bottom - up scenario more massive objects form later , and are therefore younger and bluer  in contrast to the observed cmr  the original works were substantially suffering from the problem of creating luminous red elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is also not a priori clear if these models which yield strong evolution at intermediate redshift ( kauffmann , charlot & white 1996 ) would be able to reproduce the small scatter of the cmr and the mg-@xmath3 relation . on the other hand , these constraints",
    "can be easily explained by the classical single burst picture for elliptical galaxy formation , assuming passive evolution after a short formation epoch at high redshift , provided that subsequent stellar merging is negligible ( bower , kodama & terlevich 1998 ) .",
    "however , the more recent models by kauffmann ( 1996 , hereafter k96 ) and baugh , cole & frenk reproduce the above relations with a scatter which is in remarkably good agreement with observational data ( bower , lucey & ellis 1992 ; bender , burstein & faber 1993 ; jrgensen , franx & kjrgaard 1996 ) . the correct slope of the cmr can be obtained in a hierarchical scheme , if metal enrichment and metallicity - dependent population synthesis models are taken into account ( kauffmann & charlot 1998 ; cole et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . in such models , the slope of the cmr",
    "is only driven by metallicity , as in the classical models by arimoto & yoshii .",
    "note however , that in the framework of the inverse wind models @xcite the cmr slope could be in principle produced from a combination of both age and metallicity , since in these models more massive galaxies are assumed to be older .",
    "in this paper i aim to discuss how far hierarchical formation models are able to accomplish a further important constraint , namely the formation of @xmath0-enhanced stellar populations hosted by luminous ellipticals ( peletier 1989 ; worthey , faber & gonzlez 1992 ; davies , sadler & peletier 1993 ) .",
    "models of chemical evolution show that this constraint can be matched by the single collapse model being characterised by short star formation time - scales of the order @xmath4 yr ( e.g.  matteucci 1994 ; thomas , greggio & bender 1999 ; jimenez et  al.1999 ) , and it has been questioned by bender whether the observed [ mg / fe ] overabundance is compatible with hierarchical models .",
    "however , abundance ratios and the enrichment of @xmath0-elements have not been investigated so far in hierarchical models . for this purpose ,",
    "i consider typical star formation histories provided by semi - analytic models for hierarchical galaxy formation ( k96 ) and explore the resulting abundance ratios of magnesium and iron .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ model ] the model of chemical enrichment",
    "is briefly described .",
    "average and bursty star formation histories are then analysed in sections  [ average ] , [ bursty ] and  [ mixtures ] .",
    "the results are discussed and summarised in sections  [ discussion ] and  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the idea is to follow the chemical evolution of the galaxy describing the global chemical properties of the final object and its progenitors as a whole during the merging history . in the hierarchical clustering scheme , structures",
    "are subsequently build up starting from small disc - like objects .",
    "an elliptical is formed when two disc galaxies of comparable mass merge , which is called the ` major merger ' . before this event",
    "many ` minor mergers ' between a central galaxy and its sattelite systems happen .",
    "it is important to emphasise , that the bulk of stars , namely @xmath5 per cent , forms at modest rates in the progenitor disc - galaxies _ before _ this ` major merger ' event . in the star burst ignited by the latter ,",
    "up to 30 per cent of the total stellar mass of the elliptical is created . in k96",
    "many monte carlo simulations are performed each corresponding to one individual ( final ) galaxy .",
    "the sfh which is specified in k96 and adopted for the present analysis is an _ average _ about all these realizations .",
    "the sfh is characterised by the age distribution of the stellar populations weighted in the @xmath6-band light . in other words ,",
    "the fractional contributions @xmath7 by stellar populations to the total @xmath6-light as a function of their ages @xmath8 are specified .",
    "equation  [ trans ] shows how this translates into a star formation",
    "@xmath9 : @xmath10 here , the interval @xmath11 $ ] denotes the age bin of the population , @xmath12 is the assumed age of the universe , i.e.@xmath13  gyr for the cosmology adopted in k96 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the @xmath6-light of a simple stellar population @xmath15 as a function of its age and metallicity is taken from worthey . in this paper , the star formation rate @xmath9 as a function of time",
    "is chosen such that a set of stellar populations of various ages and metallicities is constructed which exactly covers the age distribution of the k96 models .",
    "the chemical evolution is calculated by solving the usual set of differential equations ( e.g.  tinsley 1980 ) .",
    "the enrichment process of the elements hydrogen , magnesium , iron , and total metallicity is computed , no instantaneous recycling is assumed .",
    "in particular , the delayed enrichment by type  ia supernovae is taken into account following the model by greggio & renzini .",
    "the inclusion of type ia is crucial for interpreting mg / fe ratios , since sne  ia substantially contribute to the enrichment of iron .",
    "the evolution code is calibrated on the chemical evolution in the solar neighbourhood ( thomas , greggio & bender 1998 ) .",
    "the ratio of sne  ia to sne  ii is chosen such that observational constraints like supernova rates , the age - metallicity relation and the trend of mg / fe as a function of fe / h in the solar neighbourhood are reproduced .",
    "the sn  ii nucleosynthesis prescription is adopted from thielemann , nomoto & hashimoto and nomoto et  al .  , because the stellar yields from woosley & weaver are unable to account for the [ mg / fe ] overabundance in the solar neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "the imf is truncated at @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the slope above @xmath18 is treated as a parameter , below this threshold a flattening according to recent hst measurements ( gould , bahcall & flynn 1997 ) is assumed . this flattening at the low - mass end does not significantly affect @xmath0/fe ratios .",
    "it should be noted that stars more massive than @xmath17 are expected to play a minor role in the enrichment process , because of their small number and the fall - back effect @xcite .",
    "moreover , the mean [ mg / fe ] overabundance in the metal - poor halo stars of our galaxy is well reproduced for an imf with the above truncation and salpeter slope @xmath19 @xcite , if thielemann et  al .",
    "nucleosynthesis is adopted @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6-luminosity averaged abundances in the stars are computed by using ssp models from worthey . for details",
    "i refer the reader to thomas et  al .",
    "( 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "finally , two simplifications of the present model should be mentioned :    1 .   a one - phase interstellar medium ( ism )",
    "is assumed .",
    "kauffmann & charlot , instead , distinguish between cold and hot gas allowing mass transfer among these two components .",
    "since stars form out of cold gas , this process basically controls the feed - back mechanism of star formation .",
    "the resulting effects on the star formation rate , however , are already covered , since i directly adopt the sfh from k96 .",
    "the influence on the abundance _",
    "ratio _ of mg and fe is expected to be negligible , as long as these elements do not mix on significantly different time - scales .",
    "the final galaxy is treated as the whole single - unit from the beginning of its evolution , the economics of the individual progenitors are not followed separately as in k96 .",
    "hence , the simulations do not directly include galactic mass loss taking place during disc galaxy evolution ( k96 ) as well as mass transfer between the progenitor systems .",
    "the fraction of gas converted to stars is adjusted to global metallicities typically observed in the respective galaxy type .",
    "the impact on the _ global _ properties of the _ final _ galaxy , however , is expected to be small . in particular , abundance _",
    "ratios _ of non - primordial elements like mg and fe are not significantly affected by mass loss and gas transfer , unless one allows for selective mechanisms .",
    "however , in the framework of the present analysis , this option shall only be discussed in a qualitative fashion .",
    "figs .  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig1b ]",
    "show the global average sfhs as they are constrained for cluster elliptical and spiral galaxies in the k96 model .",
    "the lower x - axis denote ages ( look - back time ) , the evolutionary direction of time therefore goes from the right to the left .",
    "the evolution with redshift for an @xmath20 , @xmath21 cosmology ( adopted in k96 ) is given by the upper x - axis .",
    "the histogram shows the quantity @xmath22 as it is explained in section  [ model ] . in the elliptical case ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , more than 70 per cent of the light in the @xmath6-band comes from stars which have formed in the first 3 gyr at redshift @xmath23 . the sfh of the spiral ( fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] ) , instead , is much more extended towards lower redshift . with a @xmath6-mean age of 6.2 gyr ,",
    "the latter thus leads to significantly younger populations than the sfh of the average elliptical ( 10.4 gyr ) .",
    "the plus signs in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig1b ] denote the fractional contributions from the various populations to the total mass of the object . owing to their stellar remnants ,",
    "old populations contribute more to the total mass than to the light of the object . as a consequence , in the optical band",
    "the weight of young ( old ) populations is larger ( smaller ) with respect to their actual mass .",
    "this pattern is particularly prominent in the young and old spiral populations",
    ".    the abundance ratios of mg / fe ( left - hand panels ) and fe / h ( right - hand panels ) as they result from the chemical evolution model are shown with the scale on the right y - axis , respectively .",
    "the chemical evolution of the ism is denoted by the solid line , the filled star symbols show the @xmath6-luminosity weighted average abundance ratios of the respective composite stellar population of the galaxy as a function of age ( hence formation redshift ) .",
    "the filled circles in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] represent the stellar mean mg / fe ratio if a global flattening of the imf with @xmath24 is assumed .",
    "otherwise , salpeter slope above @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is chosen .",
    "in general , the mean abundances in the stellar populations differ from those in the ism .",
    "metallicity ( fe / h ) is always higher , and mg / fe always lower in the ism than in the @xmath6-average of the stars , because the stars archive the abundance patterns of early epochs .",
    "since , in the case of the elliptical , star formation is much more skewed towards early times , this discrepancy is more significant in such objects .",
    "the gas fraction which is ejected from the galaxy is chosen such that the _ global _ stellar populations of the elliptical have solar metallicity at low redshift ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this leads to an ejection of roughly 30 per cent of the baryonic mass of the galaxy during its evolution . in the case of the spiral ( milky way ) , instead , 55 per cent of the gas are assumed to be ejected in order to yield solar metallicity in the ism after 9 gyr , roughly when the sun was born ( fig .",
    "[ fig1b ] ) .    as a consequence ,",
    "the metallicity of the ism and the stars is higher in the elliptical than in the spiral .",
    "the mg / fe ratios , instead , depend mainly on the shape of the star formation rate as a function of time . since there is no significant star formation at late times in the elliptical",
    ", @xmath25 is 20 times lower than in the spiral galaxy , which leads to a lower mg / fe in the ism by roughly 0.1 dex .",

    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this result clearly stands in disagreement to the observational indications that ( bright ) elliptical galaxies host stellar populations which are @xmath0-enhanced by at least @xmath28 dex @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] demonstrates that with salpeter imf a super - solar mg / fe ratio is only obtained at the very early stages of the evolution , namely in the first gyr .",
    "a star formation mode which is more skewed towards these early formation ages would lead to older ages and a higher degree of @xmath0-enhancement .",
    "one may argue that the average sfh considered here does not apply to _ bright _ ellipticals in which the observed @xmath0-enhancement  is most significant .",
    "however , in the k96 simulations brighter objects are on average younger @xcite , and do not experience sfhs that are more skewed towards high redshift than the present example .",
    "they are therefore unlikely to exhibit higher mg / fe ratios than calculated here .    the star formation time - scales that are required to obtain [ @xmath0/fe]@xmath29 for different imf slopes",
    "are discussed in thomas et  al .  .",
    "the filled circles in the upper - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] demonstrate that the shallower imf with @xmath24 can reconcile the extended sfh with @xmath0-enhancement .",
    "however , particularly in the hierarchical picture in which the formation of different galaxy types can be traced back to the same ( or similar ) building blocks at early epochs , a flattening of the imf restricted to elliptical galaxies does not seem to provide a compelling solution .    from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] one can also understand that only galaxy formation scenarios in which star formation _ terminates _",

    "the classical monolithic collapse provides such a star formation mode . in the hierarchical scheme , instead",
    ", ( low ) star formation at later stages is unavoidable , which directly leads to lower mg / fe ratios in the stars that form out of the highly snia enriched ism at lower redshift .",
    "the sfhs considered here apply to the _ global _ properties of the galaxy populations . however , in the picture of hierarchical clustering star bursts that are induced by mergers play an important role for the interpretation of ( particularly central ) abundance features . the star burst during the major merger forms @xmath31 per cent of the final stellar mass , which is likely to dominate the galaxy core , since the gas is driven to the central regions of the merger remnant @xcite . in this section",
    "i shall investigate the abundance patterns of the population that results from a @xmath32  gyr star burst triggered by the major merger which forms the final elliptical .      in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the dotted histogram denotes the distribution of these major merger events among the elliptical galaxy population . at the given epoch when the star burst occurs ,",
    "the new stellar population forms out of the ism whose abundances are shown by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . owing to the short duration of the star burst , the mean mg / fe ratios in the newly created stars",
    "are higher than the initial values in the ism as indicated by the arrows and the dotted line ( left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the slope of the imf is assumed salpeter also during the burst .",
    "it turns out that , due to the extremely low mg / fe ratios and the high metallicities in the ism at the merger epoch , such star bursts are inappropriate to raise mg / fe up to a level consistent with observational values .",
    "the resulting mg / fe does not differ from the mean average in the global stellar populations .",
    "the metallicity fe / h , instead , increases to even higher values between 0.3 and 0.5 dex , depending on the burst epoch ( upper - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . under the assumption that the entire central population forms in the major burst",
    "the model leads to radial metallicity gradients of @xmath33 dex from the inner to the outer parts of the galaxy , in contradiction to observational measurements of @xmath34  dex per decade @xcite . a mixture of @xmath35 between burst and global population in the galaxy nucleus is required to smooth the gradient down to the observed value .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] unfold the principle dilemma of the hierarchical picture : the initial conditions in the ism at the burst epoch , namely super - solar metallicity and sub - solar mg / fe , are highly unfavourable in producing @xmath0-enhanced populations . as shown in thomas et  al . , this incapability of late merger events is independent of the burst time - scale and sn  ia rates during the burst . the most promising way out to reconcile an intermediate or late merger with @xmath0-enhancement  is to assume a flattening of the imf during the star burst .",
    "the arrows and dotted lines in fig .  [ fig2 ] show the abundance patterns ( left - hand panel : mg / fe , right - hand panel : fe / h ) of the burst population if a shallow imf ( @xmath24 ) _ during the burst _ is assumed .",
    "the chemical evolution of the global ism is based on salpeter imf ( @xmath19 ) as before .",
    "it turns out that , with a significant flattening of the imf , the major merger burst produces a metal - rich @xmath0-enhanced stellar population . as demonstrated in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the bulk of ellipticals experience their major merger at look - back times of @xmath36  gyr ( @xmath37 ) and therefore exhibit significant @xmath0-enhancement  in the burst population .",
    "the question is how do the global and the burst populations mix ?",
    "the value @xmath24 represents the minimum flattening required for the case that the pure burst population is observed , i.e.  in the centre of the galaxy .",
    "apart from the fact that no mixing of the two population types seems unlikely , it would produce metallicity gradients much too steep .",
    "table  [ tab ] gives the average abundance ratios for different mixtures of the global ( imf slope @xmath19 ) and the 8  gyr - burst populations ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "[ fe / h] denotes the metallicity if the efficiency of the star burst is reduced from 99 to 50 per cent .",
    "mg / fe is not significantly affected @xcite .",

    "more likely , however , is that the burst populations are more prominent in the inner parts due to dissipation processes in the burst gas @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab ] can then be interpreted in terms of increasing galaxy radius from bottom to top .",
    "abundance gradients result according to the global - burst mixtures assumed at different radii of the object .",
    "i shall briefly discuss the following model , in which i roughly devide the galaxy in three zones separated by the inner radius @xmath39 and the effective radius @xmath40 .",
    "the resulting stellar abundance ratios in each zone for the respective different global - burst mixtures are shown in table  [ tab2 ] .",

    "the star formation efficiency of the burst population is assumed to be 50 per cent , in order to avoid metallicities that exceed observational determinations . in table",
    "[ tab2 ] , the quota of the burst population is steadily decreasing towards the outer zones of the galaxy , which leads to gradients such that both mg / fe and fe / h are decreasing with increasing radius .    .abundance ratios in the three zones separated by @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the first column gives the fraction of total light provided by the respective zone , cols .  2 and  3 specify the global - burst mixtures within each zone .",
    "[ fe / h] is explained in the caption of table  1 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab2 ]",
    "the galaxy nucleus is most metal - rich and significantly @xmath0-enhanced , the gradients of both mg / fe and fe / h within @xmath40 , however , are rather shallow .",
    "thus this model predicts the mg / fe overabundance not to decline remarkably out to @xmath40 , in accordance with worthey et  al .   and davies et  al .  .",
    "it is interesting to mention that the tendancy of a slight decrease in @xmath0-enhancement  is found in the coma cluster sample analysed by mehlert  et  al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the gradient in metallicity as given in table  [ tab2 ] is also consistent with estimates by davies et  al .   and kuntschner .",
    "finally it should be emphasized , that reasonable metallicities are only achieved if star formation during the burst is assumed to be efficient by only 50 per cent .",
    "table  [ tab ] shows that otherwise metallicities above @xmath41 would be obtained in the centre , which exceeds observational determinations @xcite .",
    "it should again be emphasized that the sfhs discussed here are averages over many monte carlo realizations , individual galaxies are therefore not considered . this approach is sensible because also the observational constraint is taken to be a mean @xmath0-enhancement  about which the values measured for the single galaxies scatter .",
    "still , in a more detailed analysis it would be of great interest to resolve the sfhs of individual galaxies and to compare the theoretical scatter in @xmath0-enhancement  with the observed one .",
    "in the following i will discuss uncertainties in chemical evolution that may have an important impact on the results .",
    "furthermore possible implications on properties of cluster and field galaxies are mentioned .",
    "the model of chemical evolution applied for this analysis is calibrated such that the basic local abundance features are covered @xcite . besides stellar yields and imf , this also includes the prescription of the type ia supernova , which is adopted from greggio & renzini . according to this model ,",
    "the maximum of the sn  ia rate occurs roughly 1  gyr after the birth of the stellar population .",
    "it is obvious that this time - scale has a great impact on the results presented here . from the solar neighbourhood data",
    ", one can not entirely exclude a sn  ia rate which sets in later and stronger . such a model would basically delay ( not prevent ) the decrease of the mg / fe ratio , hence in the hierarchical clustering scheme the _ global _ populations of ellipticals would still not appear @xmath0-enhanced . however , the mg / fe ratios in the ism would be higher _ at the major burst epochs _ , leading to more @xmath0-enhancement  in the burst populations",
    ".    uncertainties in stellar yields @xcite allow to raise the calculated mg / fe ratios .",
    "note , however , that the degree of @xmath0-enhancement  used as the main constraint in this paper ( [ @xmath0/fe]@xmath42  dex ) represents the lowest limit determined from observational data .",
    "a very early chemical pre - enrichment by popiii - like objects may induce initial conditions in favour of high mg / fe ratios .",
    "the results in this paper , however , are not seriously affected by such uncertainties , since it is argued differentially to the solar neighbourhood chemistry on which the chemical evolution model is calibrated . thus details of the overall chemical initial conditions in the early universe do not alter the conclusions .",
    "type  ia supernovae explode later than type  ii , thus their ejection occurs at different dynamical stages of the merging history . in a scenario in which type ia products ( basically iron ) are lost easier ,",
    "the accomplishment of enhanced mg / fe ratios is simplified .",
    "the examination of this alternative , however , requires a more detailed analysis of the possible outflow and star formation processes during the merging history , which by far exceeds the scope of this paper . on the other hand",
    "it is important to notice , that @xmath0-enhanced giant elliptical galaxies enrich  for salpeter imf  the intracluster medium ( icm ) with mg / fe _ underabundant _ material @xcite .",
    "a selective loss mechanism as mentioned above further increases this icm - galaxy asymmetry @xcite and therefore causes a more striking disagreement with observational measurements which indicate solar @xmath0/fe ratios in the icm @xcite .      the sfh discussed in this paper applies to _ cluster _ ellipticals .",
    "in such a high density environment , the collapse of density peaks on galaxy scale is boosted to high redshifts ( k96 ) . in the low - density surroundings of the field ( haloes of @xmath43 ) , instead , the situation is entirely different .",
    "the k96 model predicts that objects in the field are not destined to be ellipticals _ or",
    "_ spirals , but actually undergo transformations between both types due to gas accretion ( formation of a disc galaxy ) or merging of similar sized spirals ( formation of an elliptical ) . as a consequence , the objects we happen to observe as bright ellipticals in the field should have mostly had a recent merger in the past 1.5 gyr .",
    "this leads to younger mean ages , but also to a more extended sfh .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] show that later bursts yield lower mg / fe ratios . from the models",
    ", one should therefore expect a trend such that ( bright ) ellipticals in the field are on average _ less _",
    "@xmath0-enhanced than their counterparts in clusters ( see also thomas 1998a ) .",
    "thus , the _ intrinsic _ difference between cluster and field ellipticals ( k96 ) , which manifests itself most prominent in the properties of _ bright _ elliptical galaxies , should be measurable in their @xmath0-element abundance patterns .",
    "in this paper , i analyse average star formation histories ( sfh ) as they emerge from hierarchical clustering theory with respect to their capability of producing @xmath0-enhanced abundance ratios observed in elliptical galaxies . for this purpose ,",
    "the @xmath6-luminosity weighted age distributions for the stellar populations of the model spiral and cluster elliptical galaxy are adopted from kauffmann ( 1996 , k96 ) .",
    "owing to the constant level of star formation in spiral galaxies , their sfh leads to roughly solar mg / fe ratios in the stars _ and _ in the ism , in agreement with observations in the milky way . for elliptical galaxies ,",
    "hierarchical models predict more star formation at high redshift and therefore significantly older mean ages . however , the calculations in this paper show , that their sfh is still too extended in order to accomplish a signifcant degree of _ global _ @xmath0-enhancement  in the stars .",
    "star bursts ignited by the major merger when the elliptical forms , instead , provide a promising way to produce metal - rich mg / fe overabundant populations , under the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "the nucleus predominantly consists of the burst population formed in the major merger .",
    "2 .   the burst population provides roughly 30 per cent of the total @xmath6-light of the galaxy .",
    "the imf is significantly flattened ( @xmath44 ) _ during the burst _ with respect to the salpeter value ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "4 .   the efficiency of star formation during the burst has to be reduced to roughly 50 per cent , in order to garuantee shallow metallicity gradients within the galaxy .",
    "the burst populations and its proportions to the global populations turn out to occupy a crucial role in producing mg / fe overabundance in the framework of hierarchical galaxy fotmation .",
    "a direct consequence of the model is a slight gradient in @xmath0-enhancement  in terms of decreasing @xmath0/fe with increasing radius .",
    "a further implication is that bright _ field _ ellipticals are predicted to exhibit lower @xmath0/fe ratios than their _ cluster _",
    "counterparts , due to the younger mean ages and hence more extended sfhs of the former .",
    "a future theoretical task will be to directly combine the chemical evolution of @xmath0-elements and iron with semi - analytic models in order to allow for a more quantitative analysis than provided by this paper .",
