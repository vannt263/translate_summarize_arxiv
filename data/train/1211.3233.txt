    "for many applications , it is important to obtain location information about a resident in an indoor environment . for example , knowing the position of a resident can facilitate the control of the heating and air conditioning systems .",
    "existing solutions , however , are intrusive , and they do not respect the private life of the resident ( e.g. , audio or video monitoring @xcite ) , or they are obliging people to keep sensor on their body all the time ( e.g. , the magneto - inertial navigation technique @xcite ) . in this study , we propose a new indoor localization algorithm that is not constrained .",

    "+ the vibration signature of the human footstep on a floor creates an elastic wave that is induced by the walking motions .",
    "our goal is to localize footsteps using seismic sensors that are fixed on the floor in the indoor environment .",
    "only a few studies have described seismic methods that are applicable to footstep localization in an indoor environment .",
    "the present techniques can be divided into two groups :    * techniques based on seismic - wave structures @xcite : with this type of technique , a footstep is modeled as a seismic signal composed of p - waves ( longitudinal waves ) and s - waves ( transversal waves ) in a three - dimensional environment . using this assumption ,",
    "the direction of arrival can be determined from the correlation between the signals recorded by a three - axis accelerometer .",
    "these techniques which where initially devised for outdoor envoironments can not be easily transposed in indoor environments .",
    "indeed , the signals recorded indoors by a sensor is a mix of direct and reflected waves ( e.g. , reflections on the edge of the slab , reflections on the furniture and facilities ) in an almost two - dimensional environment .",
    "a concrete slab in a building is better modeled by a thin plate than by a semi infinite half space propagation medium .",
    "propagating flexural waves dominate the response .",
    "+ the time delay between two paths is very short in an indoor environment .",
    "the distances are only a few meters and the propagation velocity of seismic waves is more than @xmath0 in a concrete medium . in addition ,",
    "elastic waves propagated on the floor depend on many factors ; among these , the footwear of the person , the angle of impact excitation , the construction of the floor , and the geometrical walking pattern @xcite are important factors , among others . the physical characteristics of the medium itself ( concrete ) exhibit a high variablity , with an important impact on the wave propagation velocity wich may vary from one sector to another on the same slab . as a consequence , cross - correlation based approaches specifically derived for source location in thin plates ( see e.g. @xcite ) can not be used here . * techniques based on range delay estimation @xcite : these techniques , such as hyperbolic localization @xcite , are based on time differences of arrival ( tdoa ) and the propagation velocity estimation .",
    "the propagation velocity is assumed to be constant and independent of the source position . in other words ,",
    "the time of arrival ( toa ) depends linearly on : sensor distance .    in what follows",
    ", we will first discuss the applicability of localization techniques assuming a constant propagation velocity for the problem of footstep localization using seismic sensors .",
    "indeed , because the various wave components travel at different propagation velocities , footstep signals will vary from one receiver location to another .",
    "the detected arrival times and the perceived propagation velocities will closely depend on the attenuation and the dispersion properties of the floor .",
    "a theoretical study of elastic - wave propagation based on a simplified bending - wave equation will be conducted in section [ tdoa ] .",
    "this study will show that the perceived propagation velocity decreases in a floor assimilated to a thin , damped , and dispersive plate if the source - sensor distance increases .",
    "analytical and experimental results will also be presented to reinforce this conclusion . therefore localization techniques based on range delay estimation are inadequate for our problem . +",
    "a new localization algorithm will be proposed in section [ principle_so - tdoa ] .",
    "this new algorithm takes into account the nonconstant propagation velocity and exploits the property that the order of arrival of the signals at the sensors is maintained in the dispersive and damped floor being considered .",
    "the proposed footstep localization algorithm is based on a study of the sign of the time differences of the arrival ( so - tdoa ) .",
    "the development of the proposed algorithm will be followed in section [ perf ] , where we describe simulation results and analyze the performances of the proposed so - tdoa algorithm , as compared with the hyperbolic algorithm that is based on range estimation .",

    "the floor of an indoor environment will be assimilated to a thin damped isotropic plate @xcite throughout this study . considering this assumption ,",
    "the goal of this section is to define the influence of the dispersion and the damping effects on the `` perceived propagation velocity '' estimated by a given measuring strategy .",

    "assuming a damped and dispersive floor , the problem of footstep localization in indoor environments can not be solved using traditional source - localization algorithms based on range estimations , because the perceived propagation velocity depends on the source - sensor distances ( section [ tdoa ] ) .",
