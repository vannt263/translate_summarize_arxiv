    "the random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) problem arises from a number of situations in physics , chemistry , and biology .",
    "one of the early rsa problem comes from polymer chemistry .",
    "flory @xcite was interested in the dimerization of polymer chain .",
    "the adjacent monomers on the side of the chain form dimers one at a time until no pair of monomers is available .",
    "he found the final reacted monomers based purely on geometric argument .",
    "it turns out that this problem is equivalent to a random sequential adsorption of dimers on a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "consider the one - dimensional lattice , with all sites empty initially . at time @xmath1 ,",
    "dimers , each of which occupies two consecutive sites , are dropped on the lattice at a rate @xmath2 per second equally likely at any locations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : config](a ) ) . as long as the two sites are empty",
    ", a dimer lands on the lattice .",
    "if any one of the two sites is already occupied , the deposition is rejected .",
    "this is the basic rsa model .",
    "rsa of many different geometric objects has been studied .",
    "the deposition of unit line segments on a one - dimensional continuum is called car - parking problem @xcite . the deposition of discs on two - dimensional continuum @xcite is relevant to the adsorption of colloids or protein molecules on glass surface @xcite .",
    "lattice models of various geometries are studied . in fig .  [",
    "fig : config ] we show some typical configurations of rsa models .",
    "the very basic question of rsa is the time dependence of the coverage , @xmath0 , and the jamming coverage , @xmath3 .",
    "the approach to the jamming coverage is also of considerable interest .",
    "it turns out that the approach to the jamming coverage is to some extent universal . for lattice models , the approach to jamming is always exponential due to the discreteness of the problems @xcite , while for continuum problems the asymptotic dependences exhibit power laws which depend on the symmetry of the deposited objects @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive review on rsa and cooperative sequential adsorptions is given by evans @xcite .",
    "bartelt and privman @xcite reviewed , among other things , mean - field approximations .",
    "progress on experiment work is given by ramsden @xcite .",
    "random sequential adsorption has many aspects and is rich with problems . in this article , we limit our scope to consider two important approximate techniques for computing the coverage of rsa .",
    "they are the series expansion and monte carlo simulation .",
    "the emphasis is on methods rather than specific results .",
    "only one - dimensional problems @xcite and quasi - one - dimensional problems @xcite have exact solutions .",
    "two - dimensional problems are most likely intractable . because of this , the approximate methods like series expansion and monte carlo are very useful for the study of rsa .",
    "we present some of the technical details which are usually given only briefly in original research papers . with examples ,",
    "we show how the series can be obtained and analyzed with pad approximation . for monte carlo simulation ,",
    "the emphasis is on efficient algorithms for rsa simulation .",
    "one of the well - developed methods in studying random sequential adsorption is series expansion around time @xmath4 .",
    "the method gains experience from series expansion studies of other problems in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "series expansion approach was the only successful method to obtain nonclassical results in the study of critical phenomena for a while before the advent of renormalization group method @xcite .",
    "the methods and technique developed , especially the pad approximation technique @xcite , have been also applied successfully to random sequential adsorption .",
    "the technique offers a systematic approach with controlled approximation . unlike the approach with truncated rate equations @xcite , series expansion",
    "can be automated on computer relatively easily , and the number of terms obtained can be rather high . in many cases ,",
    "the accuracy is higher than or comparable to most accurate monte carlo simulation results .",
    "the series expansion for the rate of adsorption as a function of particle density has been introduced by widom @xcite .",
    "it was shown that this type of expansion is similar to virial expansion for the equation of state .",
    "in fact , the first two coefficients involving one and two - particle distributions are the same . the difference between equilibrium system and rsa starts at third order .",
    "series for hard discs on two - dimensional continuum up to third order were first obtained by schaaf and talbot @xcite .",
    "series expansions for lattice models and continuum systems have been considered by hoffman @xcite and evans @xcite .",
    "evans presented rate equation approach for deriving series . the series in time and in density",
    "are related by a transformation , so they are equivalent .",
    "high - order series with the help of computer were derived by baram and kutasov @xcite , dickman _",
    "et al _ @xcite , bonnier _ et al _ @xcite , baram and fixman @xcite , and gan and wang @xcite .",
    "the rsa process can be described fully with a master equation of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a set of state variables which completely specify the state of the system ; @xmath7 is the probability of such a state ; and @xmath8 is a transition matrix . for notational convenience",
    ", we shall consider discrete lattice models .",
    "continuous space problem can be generalized easily .",
    "then @xmath9 denotes a set of occupation variables @xmath10 located at site @xmath11 .",
    "although eq .",
    "( [ eq : master ] ) contains the complete information of the process , it is rather difficult to deal with efficiently due to the high dimensionality of the problem .",
    "thus , in most of the analytic treatments , reduced quantities are worked with .",
    "one of the most important such quantities is the marginal probability distribution : @xmath12 where the summation is over all the possible states such that a given set @xmath13 of sites takes a known set of values .",
    "that is , @xmath14 is the probability that a given set of sites having specified values . for the standard rsa problem , it is sufficient to consider only a set of connected sites which are unoccupied .",
    "our task is to write down a set of differential equations for @xmath14 . in principle",
    ", we can derive them from the master equation ( [ eq : master ] ) .",
    "this is not really necessary , and we can give the equations based on physical meaning of @xmath14 .",
    "let us take a look of the equations associated with a random sequential deposition of dimers on a one - dimensional lattice . in this case",
    ", we consider the probability @xmath15 that a consecutive @xmath16 sites are empty . assuming translational invariance of the initial conditions , this probability does not depend on the specific locations . due to the simple geometry in one dimension , the set @xmath13 of @xmath16 connected sites being empty can be characterized by a single integer @xmath16 .",
    "let us consider the change of @xmath15 by the deposition process .",
    "we assume that the @xmath16 empty sites are at @xmath17 . clearly , depositions of dimers involving the sites @xmath18 or @xmath19 do not change @xmath15 , while depositions inside empty sites on 1 to @xmath16 destroy the consecutive empty sequence , the probability of which is proportional to @xmath15 for each of the @xmath20 possible ways of depositions . at the two ends , the empty sequence can be destroyed with one site at 0 ( or @xmath21 ) outside the sequence and the other site at 1 ( or @xmath16 ) in the sequence , see fig .",
    "[ fig : rate ] . in order for this to happen , the site just outside the considered sequence should be empty , the probability of which is @xmath22 .",
    "there are two ways to do this . putting all these together",
    ", we have ,    @xmath23    the proportionality constant @xmath2 sets the time scale . without loss of generality ,",
    "we can take it to be unity .",
    "this equation can be solved @xcite to give @xmath24 . \\label{eq:1dexact}\\ ] ] note that the coverage is just @xmath25 .",
    "similar consideration gives so - called rate equations @xcite for other deposition processes .",
    "for example , in deposition of dimers on square lattice , the basic quantity of interest is the probability @xmath14 that the given set @xmath13 of sites are empty ; we do not care other sites being occupied or empty .",
    "the rate of decrease is proportional to the probability that the current configuration @xmath13 can be destroyed by depositing a dimer with at least one site in @xmath13 .",
    "thus we have @xmath26 where the summation runs over all possible ways of depositing a dimer at a pair of empty sites such that at least one site is in @xmath13 ; @xmath27 if two of the dimer sites of a deposition attempt are within @xmath13 , or @xmath28 is one site more than @xmath13 so that a deposition with one site in @xmath13 and one site outside @xmath13 can be carried out .",
    "the first two equations look like these : @xmath29 @xmath30 there are four ways to destroy a single empty site , provided that the nearest neighbor site is also empty . using the assumption that initial conditions are lattice symmetry invariant , we can write them simply as @xmath31 . the second equation is derived similarly .    for a general discussion ,",
    "we write the rate equations symbolically as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a linear operator defined by @xmath34 the @xmath16-th derivative is then @xmath35 we assume that all sites are empty at @xmath4 .",
    "we can obtain the rules for series expansion starting from the rate equation , eq .  ( [ eq : rate ] ) .",
    "we begin with a concrete example of the random sequential adsorption of single site occupation with nearest neighbor exclusion on a square lattice . a site can be occupied by a particle , as long as the four nearest neighbors are empty .",
    "figure  [ fig : config](b ) shows a sample configuration of the nearest neighbor exclusion rsa model .",
    "the first few rate equations read : @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 where a pattern with o s denotes a set of sites of that geometric arrangement which are empty ( while other sites are unspecificed ) .",
    "we have taken into account the translational and rotational symmetry of the problem .",
    "the equations are genenerated as follows .",
    "for each given configuration @xmath13 , we consider all possible ways of destroying the configuration by a deposition of a particle at each one of the empty sites . if the four neighbors are already known to be empty , the rate is simply proportional to the original probability @xmath14 . if the site is adjacent to sites of unknown status , we require those sites to be empty",
    ". thus this second type of process creates new configurations @xmath28 which have more empty sites than @xmath13 .    from this set of rate equations",
    "we can get the @xmath16-th derivative of the probability that the sites in the set @xmath13 are empty , @xmath39 . with an initial condition of empty lattice at @xmath4 ,",
    "the zeroth derivative @xmath40 equals 1 for all configurations @xmath13 .",
    "the most relevant one is the probability that a single site is empty , @xmath41 , since @xmath42 is the coverage .",
    "power series expansion is obtained from the derivatives evaluated at @xmath4 : @xmath43 for the nearest neighbor exclusion model , we have @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate1 ] ) . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rate2 ] ) , we get @xmath46 .",
    "similarly , we find @xmath47 .",
    "thus , to third order , the expansion is @xmath48    the process of obtaining the answer can be thought as counting the number of patterns in @xmath16 generations .",
    "we note that for each current configuration @xmath13 , we go over the sites of @xmath13 once , each generated a next generation pattern , which may or may not be the same as the parent pattern .",
    "the expansion coefficient @xmath49 is fixed at the origin , while @xmath50 varies in a domain @xmath51 , and @xmath52 in a union domain @xmath53 ,  , and @xmath54 varies in a domain @xmath55 .",
    "the domain @xmath56 is the center site @xmath57 plus four nearest neighbor sites of @xmath57 .",
    "we write @xcite @xmath58 @xmath59 is defined by @xmath60 . by definition , @xmath61 is always positive . in terms of @xmath61 ,",
    "the expansion for the rate of adsorption is @xmath62 this notation is convenient , for eq .",
    "( [ eq : sn ] ) generalizes to other type of lattice models by choosing a different domain @xmath56 and generalizes to random sequential adsorption on continuum . for anisotropic objects",
    ", @xmath57 should be understood as position and orientation as well .",
    "the easiest way of implementing this counting method is to use recursive function calls . consider the following c - like pseudo - code :    in this program , @xmath13 is a set of empty sites , which can be represented by a list of coordinates of the sites ; @xmath63 is the union of the set @xmath13 and the set consisting of @xmath57 and its four nearest neighbors ; @xmath64 is the cardinality of the set .",
    "the variable @xmath13 is local to each function call , while @xmath61 is global .",
    "we assume that @xmath61 is initialized to zero .",
    "the recursion stops after @xmath65 in depth , which gives us results for @xmath59 to @xmath66 .",
    "if we evoke the program by * rsa*@xmath67 , the derivatives @xmath68 , @xmath69 , are computed .    clearly , the above algorithm can be improved .",
    "first of all , we need not count a configuration if it is the same as the parent configuration .",
    "we shall discuss this in detail later in section 2.5 .",
    "the second improvement is to rewrite the recursive calls by nonrecursive procedure .",
    "since the set @xmath13 always contains the parent set where @xmath13 is derived , it is possible to use only one list representing all the @xmath13 s ( one for each level in the recursion ) , each ends at some point in the list .",
    "of course , the bookkeeping will be more complicated .",
    "none of the above suggestions will improve the speed of calculation substantially . in next section ,",
    "we discuss perhaps the most efficient algorithm @xcite for the series expansions on lattices .",
    "we note that in the simple counting algorithm , we did not use the symmetry of the problem .",
    "two patterns related by translation or rotation symmetry should have the same derivatives , but this is not recognized . in order to exploit fully the symmetry of the problem , we use the technique of dynamic programming , and use sophisticated data structures .",
    "the starting point is again the rate equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the best algorithm is to combine this method with a simple counting algorithm .",
    "a general function is coded which returns the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate ] ) when the configuration @xmath13 , or the set @xmath13 , is given .",
    "the set @xmath13 is represented as a list of coordinates constructed in an ordered manner .",
    "note that each term on the right - hand side of the equation is just the probability of the set @xmath63 being empty , where @xmath57 runs over the sites of @xmath13 .",
    "terms which are identical after translational and rotational symmetry consideration are collected as one term with associated coefficients . each rate equation",
    "is represented by a node together with a list of pointers to other nodes .",
    "each node represents a function characterized by the set @xmath13 .",
    "the node contains pointers to the derivatives of this node obtained so far , and pointers to the `` children '' of this node and their associated coefficients , which form a symbolic representation of the rate equations .",
    "the computation of @xmath16-th derivative uses the rate equations recursively .",
    "since each node is linked to other nodes , the computation of the @xmath16-th derivative can be considered as expanding a `` tree '' ( with arbitrary number of branches ) of depth @xmath16 .",
    "the tree structure for the nearest neighbor exclusion model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tree ] . unlike the standard tree ,",
    "we allow loops linking back to earlier generations .    the traversal or expansion of the tree @xcite can be done in a depth - first fashion or a breadth - first fashion .",
    "each has a different computational complexity .",
    "a simple depth - first traversal requires only a small amount of memory of order @xmath16 .",
    "however , the time complexity is at least exponential , @xmath70 , with a large base @xmath71 .",
    "a breadth - first algorithm consumes memory exponentially , even after the number of the rate equations has been reduced by taking the symmetry of the problem into account .",
    "the idea of dynamic programming can be incorporated in the breadth - first expansion where the intermediate results are stored and referred . to achieve the best performance ,",
    "a hybrid of strategies is used to reduce the computational complexity :    * each configuration ( pattern ) is transformed into its canonical representation ; all configurations related by lattice symmetry are considered as the same configuration .",
    "* we use breadth - first expansion to avoid repeated computations involving the same configuration . if a configuration has already appeared in earlier expansion , a pointer reference is made to the old configuration .",
    "each configuration is stored in memory only once . however , storing of all the distinct configurations leads to a very fast growth in memory consumption . for a quick check if a configuration is already stored , we use the standard technique of hashing @xcite . *",
    "the last few generations in the tree expansion use a simple depth - first traversal to curb the problem of memory explosion .",
    "* parallel computation proves to be useful .",
    "the program is controlled by two parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath72 is the depth of breadth - first expansion of the tree .",
    "when depth @xmath72 is reached , we no longer want to continue the normal expansion in order to conserve memory . instead",
    ", we consider each leaf node afresh as the root of a new tree .",
    "the derivatives up to @xmath74th order are computed for this leaf node .",
    "the expansions of the leaf nodes are done in serial , so that the memory resource can be reused .",
    "the parameter @xmath73 controls the number of last @xmath73 generations which should be computed with a simple depth - first expansion algorithm .",
    "it is a simple recursive counting algorithm , which uses very little memory , and can run fast if the depth @xmath73 is not very large . in this algorithm",
    "the lattice symmetry is not treated .",
    "this technique is used to obtain the rsa series for dimer and nearest neighbor exclusion models on square and honeycomb lattices @xcite , rsa with diffusional relaxation @xcite , and ising relaxation dynamics @xcite .",
    "the results derived for lattice model can be generalized for continuum system .",
    "consider the deposition of disc of diameter @xmath75 .",
    "one way to obtain the rules for series expansion in continuum is to consider the limit of discretized lattice model .",
    "the rsa of discs can be thought as approximate lattice problem with a single - site deposition and exclusion of sites within some distance of the occupied site .",
    "the analog of eq .",

    "( [ eq : sncont ] ) has a rather complicated integration domain . to simplify the integral",

    "the value of a ( labeled ) graph is the integral of a form @xmath89 , called cluster integral .",
    "the numerical factor is the number of topologically distinct ways of labeling the graph , subject to the following constraint : the labels are put down in sequential order from 0 to @xmath16 , such that the current vertex @xmath2 is connected to a vertex @xmath90 .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between a graph and an integral .",
    "each vertex @xmath11 of the graph corresponds to an integration variable @xmath77 ( except vertex 0 ) , and each edge @xmath91 of the graph corresponds to a function @xmath83 .",
    "the definitions differ slightly from the normal convention @xcite .",
    "the diagrammatic rules give , for the particle density , the following expression for the first few terms , @xmath92 this diagrammatic rule is similar to the mayer theory @xcite for equilibrium fluid system .",
    "the major difference is the prefactor . in mayer theory ,",
    "the integer factor is simply the number of different ways of labeling a graph , without imposing an ordering .",
    "it turns out that the parallel is deeper than this , see table  [ tab : compare ] .",
    "just like the topological reduction in mayer theory , by some transformation , given @xcite arrived at an expansion involving only the star graphs ( irreducible graphs ) .",
    "let @xmath93 be the rate of adsorption , which is proportional to the area available for deposition .",
    "we have the following virial expansion @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the sum of contributions from all @xmath88-point star graphs with the rsa multiplicity factor .",
    "the first few terms are @xmath96 the diagrammatic rules can also be applied to lattice models when the mayer function and integrals are properly interpreted .",

    "monte carlo simulation method has the advantage of very little programming investment , quick and robust results .",
    "random sequential adsorption , especially lattice models , can be simulated on a computer rather easily .",
    "the basic variables ( declared as an array ) are the occupations of the lattice sites . at each time step",

    "the coordinates of the particles are stored to register the locations . to speed up the checking for overlapping ,",
    "`` coarse - grained occupation variables '' are needed to indicate where are the particles in a given range , a technique borrowed from molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "for example , in rsa of discs , the total @xmath100 surface area is partitioned into regions of squares of size @xmath101 .",
    "a disc at @xmath102 belongs to the unit square at @xmath103 , where the notation @xmath104 represents the floor or integer part of @xmath57 .",
    "an array of linked lists of disc coordinates is used to represent the deposited discs . with this data structure ,",
    "it is suffice just to check the discs located at the center and eight surround squares for overlaps .",
    "the above simple methods have a severe shortcoming that the study of late - stage process is very time - consuming .",
    "when the jamming configuration is about to be reached , much of the area is blocked .",
    "only tiny disconnected regions are available for further deposition . since we choose the sites at random with a uniform probability distribution , the available sites are hard to find .",
    "more advanced methods cleverly discover these regions and suggest deposition only in regions which are potentially possible for adsorption .",
    "first we consider the lattice models . on a lattice ,",
    "since there are only finite number ( of order @xmath105 ) of possibilities for deposition , each with equal probability in the original definition of the model , we can classify the deposition possibilities as possible and impossible attempts .",
    "for example , for the nearest neighbor exclusion model , each site is associated with a deposition attempt .",
    "the possible sites are those with center and four neighbors empty ; the impossible sites are those with any one of the five sites occupied .",
    "let us assume that we have @xmath106 possibilities for the available type and @xmath107 for the impossible type . clearly , @xmath108 . in the normal simulation , we hit the first available type with probability @xmath109 and other type with @xmath110 .",
    "consider a total of @xmath2 attempts such that the first @xmath111 failed to deposit a particle because one hits already blocked sites and the @xmath2-th attempt is successful and is deposited .",
    "what is the probability that such an event occurs ?",
    "each failed attempt occurs with probability @xmath112 , so @xmath111 consecutive fails have probability @xmath113 . since each failed attempt does not change the current state of the system , the next attempt is totally independent of the previous attempts .",
    "the successful attempt has probability @xmath114 so the total probability is @xmath115 imagine that we do not actually do the @xmath111 failed attempts , and pick one at random from the available sites and deposit the particle . from the above discussion",
    ", this is equivalent to @xmath2 attempts in units of the original time scale .",
    "however , @xmath2 is not a definite number , rather it follows the probability distribution , eq .",
    "( [ eq : event ] ) .",
    "event - driven type of algorithms was invented long - time ago for the simulation of ising models @xcite , which is known as n - fold way .",
    "an event - driven rsa algorithm @xcite on lattice is as follows : pick deposition site from the list of available sites at random .",
    "increase the time @xmath116 by @xmath117 ( @xmath118 attempts are usually defined as unit time ) .",
    "update the configuration and the list .",
    "the random integer @xmath2 can be generated by transformation method as follows : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1 .",
    "some programming efforts are needed to update the list efficiently .",
    "after one deposition , not only the current site but also some other sites in the neighborhood of the current site are no longer available .",
    "this should be correctly reflected in the list .",
    "the deposition also changes the value @xmath114 .",
    "perhaps the best application of the technique to lattice model is the rsa of polymer chains @xcite . due to a large number of conformational states of polymer chains ,",
    "the deposition becomes very slow in the late stage .",
    "an event - driven method is , therefore , essential to obtain long - time results .",
    "this is accomplished by identifying the early part of growing chains , i.e. , the partial chains and then classifying them periodically as `` available '' or `` not available '' for the deposition in an iterative fashion .",
    "the subsequent depositions are then made starting from the available partial chains choosing at random . the list of the partial chains is limited by the available computer memory and governs the speed of the program .",
    "it appears that there is an optimal list size for a given length of a chain .",
    "highly accurate monte carlo simulation results were obtained for oriented squares @xcite and for discs @xcite on two - dimensional continuum . in the rsa simulation of discs",
    ", we incorporated two important ideas : ( 1 ) divide the surface into small squares and make deposition attempts only on squares that are not completely blocked ; ( 2 ) systematically reduce the sizes of the small squares after some number of attempts and re - evaluate the availability of the squares .    in this more elaborate method , we make attempts only on squares which are potentially possible for depositions .",
    "thus the core part is an algorithm which identifies correctly whether a square is available for deposition .",
    "since the diameter of the discs is @xmath75 , each disc excludes an area of circle of radius @xmath121 for further deposition .",
    "if some area is completely covered by a union of the exclusion zones of discs , that area is not available for deposition .",
    "we begin by classifying all the squares of @xmath122 with @xmath123 as available or unavailable squares .",
    "the available squares are put on a list .",
    "deposition trials are taken only on the squares in the list , i.e. , a square in the list is chosen at random , deposition is attempted with a uniform probability over the square . after certain number of trials ( we used @xmath124 ) ,",
    "we rebuild the list , now with squares of size @xmath125 , checking only those squares on the old list .",
    "each old square is subdivided into 4 smaller squares .",
    "this shrinking of the basic squares helps to locate even extremely small available regions",
    ". they will be hit with very small probability if the area is always @xmath101 .",
    "because of integer overflow , the size of the squares is not allowed to go arbitrarily small , but the shrinking is stopped at @xmath126 .",
    "thus the smallest square has an area of @xmath127 .    for the standard rsa algorithm ,",
    "each trial increases the time @xmath116 by @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the area of the total surface . in the even - driven algorithm , where only the potentially successful depositions are tried",
    ", the clock must tick faster in order to compensate for not making attempts in the completely unsuccessful area .",
    "the time increment for each trial on the available squares is given by @xmath130 with @xmath2 generated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : k ] ) , with @xmath114 being the ratio of the area on which we try our deposition to the total area ; it is equal to @xmath131 times the number of available squares .    an important piece of code of our rsa simulation program",
    "is the identification of the squares which are fully covered by the excluded area of discs . for these squares we are sure that depositions on them will be unsuccessful , and",
    "thus they will not be on the list of candidates for trials .",
    "the algorithm that we have devised is as follows . written as a c programming language function , it returns a nonzero value if the square is fully covered and a value 0 otherwise .",
    "part ( 1 ) to  ( 5 ) is executed in the order given .    1 .",
    "find relevant discs to the current square .",
    "a disc is relevant if the square overlaps with the excluded region of the disc .",
    "note that a disc has a diameter @xmath121 and its excluded region is a concentric circle of radius @xmath121 .",
    "if all of the four vertices of the square are inside a single - disc excluded region , then it is already fully covered ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cover]a )",
    ". function returns with value  1 .",
    "3 .   for a full coverage",
    ", each vertex of the square must be at least in one of the excluded region of the relevant discs .",
    "if any one of the vertices is not covered at all by any disc , then the square is not fully covered ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cover]b )",
    ". function returns with value  0 .",
    "4 .   at this point",
    ", at least two discs are involved if the function is not returned .",
    "mapping the edges of the square to a one - dimensional line between 0 and 4 , we find out all the line segments which are covered by the excluded region of discs .",
    "if the four edges of the square are completely covered by the discs , and we have exactly two discs , then the square is fully covered ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cover]c ) , function returns with value  2 .",
    "if there are segments not covered by discs , then we know that the square is not fully covered ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cover]d )",
    ". function returns with value  0 .",
    "5 .   if the function is not returned , we know that there are at least three discs .",
    "even if all the edges are covered , the square can still contain uncovered area if three or more discs are involved .",
    "three or more discs can form holes . to make the last check , the coordinates of the intersection points of circles ( with radius @xmath121 )",
    "are calculated . in order for the interior of the square to be covered ,",
    "all the intersection points of any pair of discs which lie inside or on the square edges must be covered by a third disc .",
    "return with the number of relevant discs if the above condition is satisfied ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cover]e ) ; return value  0 if not ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cover]f ) .",
    "the order of various checks is arranged in such a way so that the most frequent and easy situations are checked first .",
    "even though the worse case computational complexity goes as @xmath132 , where @xmath16 is the number of relevant discs , a definite conclusion can be made typically much earlier . using this algorithm ,",
    "wang @xcite obtained accurate jamming coverage @xmath133 and confirmed to a high accuracy the feder s asymptotic law @xmath134 .",
    "we introduced the method of series expansions for both lattice models and continuum models .",
    "the computation of the series for the lattice model can be reduced to a counting problem .",
    "an efficient implementation requires full use of the symmetry of the problem . for continuum models ,",
    "systematic expansion in terms of a class of graphs are available .",
    "both the problem of reducing labeled graphs to unlabeled graphs and of computing the cluster integrals are computationally difficult problems .",
    "thus , the series for continuum systems are rather short",
    ". the series can be analyzed through variable transformation and pad approximation .",
    "monte carlo simulation method is versatile , and implementation is straightforward .",
    "however , efficient algorithms are available with more sophisticated data structures .",
    "the challenge to the series expansion and efficient monte carlo simulation for rsa is to apply to more complicated models which may describe better real experiment situations .",
