    "in contrast , hr 8799bcd , fomalhaut b , and @xmath12 pictoris b have ( to first order ) uniformly warm photospheres dominated by internal heat rather than reprocessed host star light .",
    "these planets are still young ( @xmath19300  myr ) ; like brown dwarfs , their atmospheres will eventually cool to low temperatures .      while the mean photospheric gas temperatures of brown dwarfs and planets are comparable , gas pressures are generally quite different . at the photosphere",
    ", gas pressure is proportional to the surface gravity , @xmath11 , as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the rosseland mean opacity .",
    "evolutionary models dictate that the surface gravities of brown dwarfs depend strongly on mass ( due to their nearly constant radii ) and weakly on age ( significant variations only for ages @xmath9 100  myr ; see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "surface gravities for evolved m , l and t dwarfs ( ages @xmath20.510  gyr ) span g@xmath23003000  m  s@xmath22 .",
    "in contrast , the vast majority of transiting exoplanets have g@xmath21030  m  s@xmath22 , as directly inferred from radial velocity and transit light curves ( e.g. , @xcite ) . ignoring opacity effects ,",
    "the photospheric gas pressures of transiting exoplanets are 12 orders of magnitude less than those of brown dwarfs .",
    "cooler , widely - orbiting jupiter - mass gas giants also have photospheric pressures about 10 times less than their ( typically more massive ) brown dwarf counterparts .",
    "differences in photospheric gas pressure can have a measurable influence on some chemical pathways .",
    "one example is the reduction reaction co + 3h@xmath3 @xmath23 ch@xmath4 + h@xmath3o , which favors ch@xmath4 production in high - pressure gas environments .",
    "chemical equilibrium models indicate that ch@xmath4 becomes abundant in brown dwarf photospheres ( 1 - 10 bar ) below @xmath21400  k , but in planetary photospheres ( 0.011 bar ) below @xmath2900  k ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "pressure also modulates some gas opacities , notably the pressure - broadened alkali lines that dominate the optical spectra of l and t dwarfs , and collision - induced h@xmath3 absorption that suppresses broad swaths of infrared light in the coldest brown dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "both features are used to constrain surface gravities for individual brown dwarfs near the sun ( e.g. , @xcite ) and verify the membership of brown dwarfs in young clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    fortuitously , there is overlap in photospheric gas pressure / temperature space between the youngest and lowest - mass brown dwarfs  those found in young star - forming regions and associations  and dense gas giant planets that are either very massive or have a substantial core .",
    "transiting planets such as hd 147506b ( aka hat - p-2b ; @xmath24 13  g  @xmath25 ; @xcite ) and corot - exo-3b ( @xmath24 26  g  @xmath25 ; ) have surface gravities similar to 30100  myr , @xmath2520 jupiter mass brown dwarfs like 2mass 1207 - 39b and ab pic b (; see figure  [ fig2 ] ) . with a mass of 22  jupiter masses , corot - exo-3b",
    "could be properly classified as a highly irradiated brown dwarf companion .",
    "in addition to mean values of photospheric temperature and pressure , differences in the pressure - temperature profiles of brown dwarfs and exoplanets must be considered . for planets ,",
    "external heating from the host star flattens out the pressure - temperature profile and can give rise to inversion layers .",
    "this translates into variations in the local gas chemistry and changes in the atmospheric column abundances of atomic and molecular absorbers .",
    "in addition , strongly irradiated planets develop deep radiative envelopes that extend well below the visible photosphere , whereas brown dwarf atmospheres are fully convective through to their photospheres ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "differences in the gas mixing rates and vertical temperature profiles between externally heated planetary atmospheres and brown dwarf atmospheres can produce profound differences in emergent spectral energy distributions , even for sources with comparable photospheric gas temperatures and pressures ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the elemental composition , or metallicity , of a cool atmosphere also modulates chemistry and spectral appearance .",
    "gas - giant planets tend to have metal - rich atmospheres , having condensed out of the gas - depleted debris disks around preferentially metal - enriched host stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ice - giant ( i.e. , neptune ) and terrestrial planet atmospheres exhibit even greater metallicity enhancements .",
    "these trends are present in the solar system : the atmospheres of jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune have effective metal abundances ranging from @xmath23 to @xmath240 times that of the sun .",
    "more importantly , there is a large range in individual elemental abundances , driven by the segregation of volatiles in the sun s early protoplanetary disk and chemical separation in planetary atmospheres ( e.g. , he settling in saturn ) .",
    "significant variations in elemental abundances can have as great or greater impact on the chemistry and molecular composition of cool atmospheres as pressure or temperature alone ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , brown dwarf metallicites are expected to span the same range as stars , topping out at perhaps 35 times solar abundances but extending down to significantly subsolar abundances in the metal - poor thick disk and halo populations .",
    "for example , members of the recently - identified l subdwarf class have metallicities @xmath20.01 - 0.1 times solar @xcite .",
    "even brown dwarfs with bulk solar metallicities will have slightly metal - poor photospheres due to condensation effects . like stars ,",
    "relative elemental abundances of brown dwarfs are likely to exhibit only small variations , although condensation effects may modify abundance patterns . in any case",
    ", the broad range of elemental abundances observed in the solar planets and expected to a greater degree among the wider exoplanet population will probably not be realized among galactic brown dwarfs .      unlike the majority of brown dwarfs , exoplanets are generally accompanied by a luminous host star , which ultimately maintains its atmosphere in a warm state , modulo variations arising from orbital eccentricity , circulation , or magnetic interaction effects .",
    "radiation and stellar winds drive non - equilibrium dynamics in exoplanet atmospheres , including internal winds / jets ( see contribution by showman ) and atmospheric stripping ( see contribution by alyward ) .",
    "uv and x - ray radiation drive photochemical production of hazes in exoplanet atmospheres ( see contribution by yung ) , and the formation of upper inversion layers .",
    "tidal locking from a close stellar companion slows an exoplanet s rotation and can provide a source of ( temporary ) internal heating .",
    "these processes will not generally occur in brown dwarf atmospheres .",
    "the hottest and youngest brown dwarfs do exhibit high - energy nonthermal emission ( x - ray and uv ) arising from magnetic activity or accretion .",
    "however , with the exception of rare massive flares in which the total magnetic energy output can briefly exceed thermal emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) , high - energy magnetic emission is typically a small fraction ( @xmath1910@xmath26 ) of the total energy budget and does not significantly alter pressure - temperature profiles .",
    "furthermore , for cooler l and t - type brown dwarfs , magnetic emission is conspicuously absent due to the loss of field / gas coupling in the highly neutral photospheres of these objects @xcite .",
    "only the very youngest ( @xmath191  myr ) , actively accreting brown dwarfs and sources in close orbits around luminous companions are likely to show significant modification of their pressure - temperature profiles as a result of external driving forces .",
    "the absence of both radiative and mechanical forcing on brown dwarf atmospheres is particularly relevant to atmospheric circulation and dynamics ( see contributions by showman and cho ) .",
    "rotational modulation of weather phenomena has been invoked to explain low - level spectral and photometric variability detected in some brown dwarfs ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "the timescales for these variations are generally consistent with rotational line broadening measurements ( e.g. , @xcite ) and variations in nonthermal magnetic emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the general absence of magnetic field coupling ( i.e. , spots ) and the clear presence of condensate clouds makes weather an appealing explanation for this variability , particularly given observed long - term period variations and changes in variability amplitudes .",
    "however , the winds and jets that drive weather in planetary atmospheres arise from asymmetric radiative forcing by the host star ; such forces are absent for most brown dwarfs .",
    "it is possible that winds could be driven by the extremely rapid rotations of brown dwarfs .",
    "periods of 110  hours are typical ( cf .",
    "jupiter s 11-hour period ) and surface rotational velocities of up to 80  km  s@xmath27 have been measured @xcite .",
    "this is an order of magnitude faster than the rotations of tidally - locked giant planets , and as a result coriolis forcing is more important in brown dwarf atmospheres .",
    "however , because of their greater surface gravities and photospheric pressures , the rhines length and rossby deformation radius scales ( see contribution by showman ) in the upper atmospheres of brown dwarfs are roughly equivalent to those for hot jupiters , of order the planetary / brown dwarf radius ( assuming horizontal wind speeds comparable to the local sound speed , @xmath21  km  s@xmath27 ; see @xcite ) . as such ,",
    "the small - scale banding and storm vorticities that characterize jupiter s visible atmosphere are probably not common on either brown dwarfs or hot jupiters , although detailed modeling of the former have yet to be reported .    in summary , while the current populations of brown dwarfs and ( warm / hot ) exoplanets may have photospheres with similar temperatures , significant differences in gas pressures and compositions may drive markedly dissimilar molecular chemistry .",
    "there is some overlap in temperature / pressure space between the densest / most massive exoplanets and the youngest / least - massive brown dwarfs , where meaningful comparisons in atmospheric properties and processes may be fruitfully made .",
    "the external forcing of a host star also results in exoplanetary atmospheric processes not seen in brown dwarfs : modified pressure - temperature profiles , inversion layers , photochemical production and thermal asymmetries that drive winds and jets . yet",
    "at least in terms of flow dynamics , the atmospheres of both tidally - locked hot jupiters and brown dwarfs should be weakly banded and have few small - scale vorticities in contrast to jupiter .",
    "i conclude my contribution with two examples of low - temperature atmospheric processes studied in detail in brown dwarf studies but not yet sufficiently constrained in exoplanetary studies : condensate cloud formation and nonequilibrium chemistry .",
    "condensed species present in the photospheres of l dwarfs arise naturally from equilibrium chemistry , proceeding from the more refractory species such as mineral oxides and silicates ( below 2500  k ) , to ionic salts and sulfides ( below 1000  k ) , to `` organic '' condensates including as h@xmath3o[s ] and nh@xmath5[s ] ( below 300  k ; see review by @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of condensed species in l dwarfs has been inferred indirectly by their very red colors and muted molecular absorption features ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "direct detection of silicate grain absorption has recently been made possible by the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ @xcite .    that these species reside in cloud structures in brown dwarf atmospheres",
    "has be inferred from other indicators : elemental depletion at high altitudes and the absence of condensates in t dwarf spectra . in the first case",
    ", the gravitational settling of condensed grains removes these species from the ambient gas , preventing further chemical reactions at higher ( cooler ) altitudes .",
    "for example , k  i absorption is particularly strong in t dwarf spectra , despite the fact that k should have condensed out into silicate grains such as kalsi@xmath5o@xmath28[s ] ( othroclase ) .",
    "this reaction is inhibited by the depletion of al and si at deeper layers through the formation of , e.g. , catio@xmath5[s ] ( perovskite ) and al@xmath3o@xmath5[s ] ( corundum ; @xcite ) ; hence elemental k persists.[s ] ( germane ) over sih@xmath4[s ] ( silane ) , despite the much greater elemental abundance of si in a solar gas mixture @xcite . ] the absence of condensate cloud absorption in t dwarf spectra can be explained if condensates are vertically confined in cloud structures which ultimately sink below the visible photosphere ( e.g. , ) .",
    "as it turns out , the disappearance of condensate clouds at the transition between l and t dwarfs is quite abrupt , suggesting dynamic effects may be critical for cloud evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath29500 l dwarfs observed to date reveal substantial diversity in cloud - sensitive features , including near - infrared colors ( @xmath291  mag scatter in @xmath30 for a given spectral subtype ) and the strength of silicate grain absorption ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these variations have been simplistically interrupted as a range in cloud `` thicknesses '' ( e.g. @xcite ) , although it is likely that other properties , such as grain size distribution , grain compositions ( e.g. , @xcite ) and cloud surface coverage also contribute .",
    "the properties of brown dwarf clouds are almost certainly tied to ( interrelated ) secondary parameters of age , surface gravity , metallicity , and rotation , as suggested by empirical trends ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , current atmospheric models generally treat cloud properties as an independent model parameter , so source - to - source variations and temporal evolution can only be treated in a somewhat ad - hoc manner .",
    "nevertheless , there has been substantial improvement in the fidelty and complexity of condensate cloud models to address the wealth of observational data , progress that can be ported to the still underconstrained problem of condensate clouds in hot exoplanetary atmospheres .",
    "the contribution of marley touches upon nonequilibrium chemistry in brown dwarf atmospheres in considerable detail , so i present only the major results here for completeness .",
    "nonequilibrium chemistry refers to the nonequilibrium abundances of species that occur when the timescale for diffusive gas flow is shorter than the timescales governing the relevant chemical reactions . in brown dwarfs , the two reactions that are most affected by nonequilibrium chemistry convert co @xmath23 ch@xmath4 and n@xmath3 @xmath23 nh@xmath5 .",
    "co and n@xmath3 have strong bonds and long chemical timescales at low temperatures , so they can appear in excess , and ch@xmath4 and nh@xmath5 in depletion , as a result of diffusive flows .",
    "such abundance anomalies are indeed observed @xcite , and indicate diffusivity constants of 1 - 100 m@xmath31  s@xmath27 , in excess of flows expected from convective instabilities @xcite .",
    "it is likely that nonequilbrium chemistry is present in exoplanetary atmospheres as well , potentially giving rise to azimuthal abundance variations in sources with large day / night asymmetries , and hence modulation of phase - resolved spectroscopy in variance with equilibrium chemistry models .",
