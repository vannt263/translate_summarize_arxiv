    "the inflation model @xcite has been the leading paradigm for the very early universe in the last three decades . in the inflation paradigm , the scale factor @xmath5 of the universe undergone a stage of exponential expansion in a very short time .",
    "this leads the universe to be flat enough to account for the flatness problem , since @xmath6 . on the other hand",
    ", this reveals that the cosmological scales observed today were deep inside the hubble scale , which accounts for the horizon problem .",
    "moreover , the cosmological scalar perturbations can be seeded by the primordial quantum fluctuations which are stretched outside of the horizon ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the scalar power spectrum is predicted to be adiabatic , gaussian , and nearly scale - invariant .",
    "this is well consistent with the present astronomical observations on the anisotropy of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the formation of large - scale structures ( lss ) .",
    "although the inflation fits the observational data well , it still suffers several significant issues , such as the fine - tuning slow - roll potential @xcite , the initial conditions @xcite , and the trans - planckian problem @xcite , etc .. in addition , one requires an inflaton field to drive the exponential expansion of the very early universe .",
    "however , the astronomical observations have not yet discovered such a fundamental scalar field until recently .",
    "it is interesting to study possible alternatives for the inflation paradigm . in an alternative scenario ,",
    "actually , one just need require that the observed universe were inside the particle horizon in the very early universe to account for the problems of big - bang cosmology . in this paper , we propose that the gravity s rainbow scenario shall meet this requirement .",
    "the gravity s rainbow scenario @xcite is arisen from the phenomenological studies of the quantum gravity which should play a significant role in the very early universe .",
    "recently , it has been utilized to study the very early universe @xcite .",
    "the spacetime metric felt by a free particle would be dependent on the energy ( or momentum equivalently ) of the particle in the gravity s rainbow scenario .",
    "thus the dispersion relation can be significantly modified for a ultra - relativistic particle .",
    "this leads to an effective speed of light .",
    "the varying speed of light ( vsl ) cosmology has been proposed @xcite , and the observable universe was assumed to be only a part of the causal area if the effective speed of light is large enough in the very early universe .",
    "thus , the gravity s rainbow scenario shall be potential to resolve the flatness and horizon problems .    in the gravity s rainbow scenario ,",
    "the evolution of the very early universe would be driven by the thermally fluid substance instead of a fundamental scalar field .",
    "we will study the thermodynamics of the system of ultra - relativistic particles with the modified dispersion relation .",
    "then the background evolution of the universe is determined by the modified friedmann equation .",
    "the solution of the friedmann equation will be showed to resolve the flatness and horizon problems .",
    "we shall focus on studying the cosmological linear perturbations and their quantization in this paper .",
    "the issue of gauge choices will be studied in detail , and then the perturbed einstein s field equations will be calculated in the longitudinal gauge .",
    "we will construct the comoving curvature perturbation which is gauge - invariant and conserved outside the hubble horizon . in this model ,",
    "the quantum fluctuations are expected to be dominated above the rainbow energy scale .",
    "furthermore , we will make constraints on the parameters of the gravity s rainbow effects by a joint analysis of the planck temperature @xcite and wmap polarization @xcite datasets .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows . in section",
    "ii , we study the evolution of the background spacetime in the gravity s rainbow scenario . in section iii ,",
    "the equations of motion are derived for the scalar perturbations .",
    "we quantize the scalar perturbations in the longitudinal gauge in section iv . in section",
    "v , we calculate the power spectrum of the primordial scalar perturbations and then make constraints on the parameters of the gravity s rainbow effects .",
    "the conclusions and discussions are given in section vi .",
    "the gravity s rainbow scenario was originally studied by magueijo & smolin @xcite .",
    "the spacetime metric felt by a free particle depends on the energy or momentum of the particle . in the study of cosmology , we are interested in the spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric which is homogeneous and isotropic . in this paper , we will study the evolution of the very early universe with the modified friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric of the form @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath5 is the scale factor of the universe , the rainbow function @xmath8 is explicitly parameterized as a power - law form , namely , @xmath9 here @xmath1 is an energy scale related to the quantum gravity , and @xmath0 is called the rainbow index which is positive .",
    "the rainbow function @xmath8 takes the limit @xmath10 . in the tangent space ,",
    "the metric ( [ rainbow metric ] ) would lead to the modified dispersion relation for a free ultra - relativistic particle .",
    "this could be given as @xmath11 where we have neglected the mass term for the particle , since the particle s mass is tiny compared to the ultra - relativistic energy .    in the enough early era of the universe , the particle could have an extremely high energy scale , i.e. , @xmath12 .",
    "then the rainbow function becomes @xmath13 thus the second term at the right hand side in ( [ mdr ] ) will be dominated , namely , @xmath14 consider a system of such ultra - relativistic particles in thermal equilibrium .",
    "it should meet the maxwell - boltzmann distribution . we can obtain the energy density @xmath15 of the system with the temperature @xmath16 , namely , @xmath17 where the constant coefficient @xmath18 is given as @xmath19 in the second equality of ( [ energy density ] )",
    ", we used the relation ( [ mdrp ] ) .",
    "the pressure @xmath20 of the system could be obtained by resolving the ordinary differential equation @xmath21 thus , it is given by @xmath22 where we neglected an integral constant , and the state parameter is given by @xmath23 the relation ( [ pressure ] ) is just the so - called the equation of state .",
    "in addition , the speed of sound could be obtained as @xmath24 which is also a constant .",
    "when @xmath25 , the above results on @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 would return back to the conventional form for the massless particles ( such as the photons ) in special relativity .",
    "the conservation of energy - momentum tensor gives the equation of continuity for the thermodynamic system . for a system of ideal fluid ,",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "its conservation implies the equation @xmath32 .",
    "implicitly , this equation can be written as the equation of continuity @xmath33 where the hubble parameter @xmath34 and @xmath35 . by combining ( [ pressure ] ) with ( [ continuity ] ) , we obtain @xmath36 hereafter the subscript `` e '' denotes physical quantities at the moment when the gravity s rainbow effect is no longer dominated , i.e. , @xmath37 . by comparing ( [ rho a ] ) to ( [ energy density ] ) ,",
    "we obtain a useful relation , i.e. , @xmath38 or equivalently , @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 can be roughly estimated at the temperature @xmath41 by the @xmath42cdm model .",
    "the evolution of the scale factor @xmath5 is determined by the friedmann equation which is deduced from the einstein s field equation @xcite . in this paper , we assume the modified einstein s equation as follows @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the einstein tensor . in this paper , we set @xmath45 .",
    "the rainbow function @xmath46 appears as the effective speed of light in the above equation .",
    "then the 00-component of einstein s equation gives the friedmann equation @xmath47 in the friedmann equation , one takes the ultra - relativistic particles as an ensemble rather than picking out a specific particle randomly @xcite .",
    "one should take into account the average effects of the ensemble on the evolution of the very early universe . by using ( [ rainbow function p ] ) and",
    "( [ mdrp ] ) , we obtain @xmath48 . as an ensemble",
    ", the thermodynamic system in thermal equilibrium has a typical energy scale , namely , the temperature @xmath16 takes a statistical mean value .",
    "thus , one could take @xmath16 as the energy appearing in the gravity s rainbow metric , namely , @xmath49 then we could resolve the friedmann equation ( [ friedmann equation ] ) , and the solution is @xmath50 where we used ( [ a t ] ) and ( [ c(t ) ] ) .",
    "we set @xmath51 to obtain an expanding universe , while @xmath52 is related to a contracting universe . if @xmath53 , the exponent @xmath54 would be divergent . this case is not well - defined .",
    "the flatness and horizon problems can be demonstrated as follows .",
    "the spatial curvature term @xmath55 is proportional to @xmath56 . with the decrease of temperature in the expanding universe ,",
    "@xmath57 should also decrease across more than @xmath58 orders of magnitude to resolve the flatness problem .",
    "then we require @xmath59 and a high energy scale @xmath60 .",
    "hereafter the subscript `` i '' denotes the start time of the rainbow universe . on the other hand ,",
    "the particle horizon @xmath61 is proportional to @xmath62 . similarly to resolving the flatness issue , it also requires @xmath59 to resolve the horizon problem .",
    "if @xmath52 , however , the temperature would increase with increase of the time based on ( @xmath63 ) and ( [ a t ] ) .",
    "this makes even worse the flatness and horizon problems .",
    "thus , the above discussions show that the rainbow index @xmath0 should satisfy the condition @xmath64 .",
    "in the following , we shall focus on studying the cosmological linear perturbations and their quantization while disregarding the statistically thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the rainbow function @xmath65 could be formally viewed as a smooth background function of the temperature .",

    "thus , the perturbed rainbow metric ( [ scalar perturbations general ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath80\\ .\\ ] ] if the anisotropic stresses are not considered , we can obtain the relation @xmath81 as will be demonstrated later .",
    "the equation ( [ phi equation ] ) for the gravitational potential @xmath92 can be reduced into a simpler form . in this paper",
    ", we just consider the case of @xmath104 , for which the reason will be clear later . by noting @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , we obtain the equation @xmath108 where @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 . here",
    "we have chosen the end moment of the gravity s rainbow effects as the original point of time . hereafter",
    ", the subscript `` e '' denotes the quantity at the moment when the gravity s rainbow effects become to be no longer dominated .",
    "one can introduce a new variable to eliminate the term proportional to @xmath113 .",
    "the new variable is given by @xmath114 .",
    "then the equation ( [ phi equation eta ] ) becomes @xmath115 where @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 .",
    "hereafter the prime denotes the derivatives with respect to @xmath119 . to quantize the new perturbation @xmath120 , the equation ( [ uk ] )",
    "can be corresponded to the action of the form @xmath121 which is very different from the one in the inflation paradigm .",
    "the canonical momentum conjugated to @xmath120 is defined as @xmath122 .    in the quantization process",
    ", the field variable @xmath120 and its canonical momentum @xmath123 become operators @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively .",
    "the operator @xmath124 obeys the equation @xmath126 which is same as ( [ uk ] ) . in general , the solution of the above equation can be given by @xmath127 where @xmath128 satisfies @xmath129 and the bosonic commutation relations are given for the creation and annihilation operators as follows @xmath130=[\\hat{a}^{+}_\\mathbf{k},\\hat{a}^{+}_\\mathbf{k^\\prime}]=0,~~[\\hat{a}^-_\\mathbf{k},\\hat{a}^{+}_\\mathbf{k^\\prime}]=\\delta^{(3)}(\\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{k^\\prime})\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the vacuum @xmath131 is defined as the state which is annihilated by @xmath132 , i.e. , @xmath133 .",
    "one requires @xmath134 to satisfy the normalization condition @xmath135 of which the left - hand - side term is the wronskian of ( [ uk ] ) . at any a given time , thus",

    "thus , its general solution can be expressed as @xmath139 note the abel s identity @xmath140 for the bessel functions .",
    "therefore , we could formally give the coefficients @xmath141 and @xmath142 as follows @xmath143 here we have disregarded a common complex - number factor which is unitary . in the uv regime , if @xmath25 , the above solution coincides with the standard formula @xmath144 in the minkowski spacetime .",
    "the reason is that @xmath145 has the asymptotic expression which is proportional to @xmath146 when @xmath147 . by substituting ( [ c1c2 ] ) into ( [ general solution ] ) , we obtain the general representation for @xmath128 .",
    "we are particularly interested in the long - wavelength perturbations . at the initial moment , these modes are deeply inside the hubble horizon because of the large quantity for the effective speed of light . with decrease of the temperature , the effective speed of light decrease rapidly .",

    "after the dominating era of the gravity s rainbow effects , they reentered the hubble horizon with the expansion of the universe . in the ir regime ,",
    "the bessel function with @xmath148 has the asymptotic expression @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "thus , the term in @xmath151 will be dominated for the long - wavelength perturbations .",

    ", one could approximate the amplitude as @xmath160 . under the limit @xmath25 , the universe becomes radiation - dominated in our model .",
    "the cosmological perturbations will be mainly determined by the fluctuations of radiations , whose amplitude @xmath161 is scaled as @xmath162 . here",

    "in this paper , we have proposed that the gravity s rainbow scenario could be an alternative of the inflation paradigm of the very early universe .",
    "the rainbow function in the metric induces the effective speed of light which depends on the energy of moving particles .",
    "we studied the thermodynamics of the system of ultra - relativistic particles with the modified dispersion relation induced by the quantum gravity effects .",

    "note that the nearly scale - invariant power spectrum for the scalar perturbations required @xmath186 , which satisfies the condition @xmath64 to account for the flatness and horizon problems .    though it shed light on the study of the very early universe ,",
    "our phenomenological scenario still suffers certain puzzling issues .",
    "first , the large quantity for the rainbow function is related with a very high energy scale at the start time of the rainbow universe .",
    "at such a high energy scale , the quantum gravity effects are unclear .",
    "second , the einstein s equation should be modified to account for the quantum gravity effects .",
    "however , we used the modified einstein s equation with the speed of light replaced by the effective speed of light .",
    "even though this equation could be reduced back to the conventional one in the general relativity , it should be demonstrated by a consistent theory of quantum gravity in principle .",
    "third , the rainbow metric belongs to the riemann - finsler geometry @xcite , whose dynamics has not been clearly studied so far . in conclusion ,",
    "one still requires a complete and consistent theory of quantum gravity to study the very early universe in future .",
