    "@xcite and @xcite have reported the detection of very narrow sio emission at ambient velocities with abundances of only @xmath710@xmath8 - 10@xmath9 , toward the ngc1333 and l1448-mm molecular outflows .",
    "for l1448-mm , it has been proposed that this emission , which is also correlated with an enhancement of the ion and electron densities @xcite , arises from material recently processed by the magnetic precursor of c - shocks @xcite .",
    "modelling of c - shock waves has traditionally focused on , and successfully reproduced , the sio abundances and line profiles generated in the evolved postshock gas @xcite , but it has usually ignored that molecular abundances and line profiles must change as c - shocks evolve in very young outflows like that powered by l1448-mm .",
    "* hereafter j08 ) have shown that the observed trend for the enhancement of the sio and ch@xmath10oh abundances from the precursor to the high velocity components in this outflow @xcite , can be explained by the progressive sputtering of the grain mantles and cores as the shock evolves .",
    "however , no attempt has been made so far to predict the expected molecular line profiles , and their changes , produced by the propagation of shock waves through the unperturbed gas .",
    "here we present the first results of the evolution of the line profiles of sio , h@xmath0co@xmath1 and hn@xmath0c , produced by the propagation of c - shocks .",
    "the derived line profiles strongly suggest that the narrow sio lines and the ion enhancement are fingerprints of the magnetic precursor of shock waves .",
    "they also reproduce the broader moderate and high velocity emission components arising from the postshock gas in l1448-mm at later stages of the evolution of the shock .",
    "we consider a plane - parallel c - shock propagating with a velocity @xmath11 through the ambient medium .",
    "the multi - layered steady - state physical structure of the shock in the frame of the preshock gas , is calculated by using the analytic approximation ( fit ) described in j08 .",

    "hereafter , the term _ time evolution _ will be used for the variation of the molecular line emission as a function of the flow time , which corresponds to the characteristic dynamical time across the shock .    from fig.@xmath12[f1 ] , it is clear that the ion fluid is accelerated before the neutrals by the magnetic precursor at the early stages of the shock .",
    "since dust grains are charged particles , they are coupled to the magnetic field and move with the ion velocity , @xmath14 . in the postshock gas , the velocities of the charged and neutral fluids re - couple again due to the transfer of momentum from the charged particles to the neutral fluid by collisions .",
    "the line profiles of species linked to the grain chemistry such as sio , are derived by considering the sputtering of the grain mantles and cores by collisions between dust grains and neutral particles such as h@xmath17 , he and other heavier species including co. as shown by @xcite and j08 , the abundances of sputtered material from dust grains , and in particular of silicon , hardly change with the initial h@xmath17 density of the gas . on the contrary , these abundances are drastically enhanced for increasing shock velocities due to the larger ion - neutral drift velocities , @xmath29 , achieved in the shock .",
    "we have assumed that a small fraction of si ( @xmath70.01% with respect to h@xmath17o ; j08 ) is present in the grain mantles .",
    "projection effects are also taken into account in the calculation of the sio abundances by including the inclination angle of the outflow with respect to the line of sight , @xmath30 ( j08 ) .",
    "we consider that sio is either directly released from the mantles @xcite or rapidly formed by the oxidation of si sputtered from the cores ( @xmath31@xmath225@xmath12yrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "the gas phase abundance of sio , @xmath32(sio ) , is calculated as a function of the flow time , @xmath33 , and the sio column density in each plane - parallel slab of gas within the shock , @xmath34(sio ) , is estimated as @xmath34(sio)=@xmath32(sio)@xmath12@xmath35(h@xmath17)@xmath36 , where @xmath35(h@xmath17 ) and @xmath37 are the h@xmath17 density and spatial width of the slab , respectively .",
    "the level populations ( i.e. excitation ) of sio in each slab of gas are calculated by using the lvg ( large velocity gradient ) approximation .",

    "the line profiles are then obtained by making the radiative transfer through all individual slabs of material .",
    "the line peak optical depth , @xmath38 , in each slab of gas is calculated by means of the lvg approximation through the following expression :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the speed of light , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the frequency and einstein coefficient of the molecular transition for which we calculate the line profiles . @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the level populations of the upper and lower energy levels respectively , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the degeneracy associated with them .",
    "@xmath47 is the radial velocity gradient along the propagation of the shock .    to determine the behaviour of the optical depth , @xmath48 , as a function of velocity ,",
    "we convolve the peak optical depth , @xmath38 , at a given velocity ( slab of material ) with a gaussian - like profile .",
    "the linewidth of every individual profile , @xmath49 , is estimated by assuming thermal and turbulent broadening , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the thermal broadening depends on the temperature of the neutral fluid , @xmath15 , as :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath54 is the mass of the molecule .",
    "the thermal broadening for the sio emission at the precursor stage with @xmath15=10@xmath12k , is only of @xmath50=0.1@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 .",
    "the turbulent linewidth is considered as a fixed parameter throughout the shock without largely affecting our estimates of the total linewidth .",
    "although turbulence in shocks still remains poorly understood , @xcite studied the effects of viscous dissipation and ion - neutral velocity decoupling on the chemistry and molecular line emission arising from turbulent flows ( filamentary vortex ) in the presence of magnetic fields in diffuse clouds .",
    "in their model , @xcite determined that the maximum tangential velocity of the vortex filaments ( which gives the rms velocity dispersion of the large scale turbulence ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is close to the alfvn velocity in the neutral fluid , @xmath25 .",
    "if we therefore assume that @xmath51 is directly proportional to @xmath25 , the increase of @xmath51 in the postshock gas can be estimated from the compression of the magnetic field and of the density of the gas at the late stages of the shock .",
    "this compression is given by the shock jump conditions @xmath55=@xmath21@xmath56 and @xmath35=@xmath18@xmath56 , where @xmath11 is the shock speed and @xmath57 depends on @xmath25 and @xmath11 as described in j08 .",
    "from here , @xmath51 in the postshock gas ranges from @xmath72.5 to 3.5 times larger than in the preshock gas for shock speeds between @xmath11=30 and 70@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 .",
    "however , despite the increase by a factor of @xmath73 in @xmath51 , the total linewidth of the sio line profile only differs by a factor of @xmath71.2 from that calculated assuming constant turbulent broadening , because thermal broadening is dominant .    for the ion and neutral species h@xmath0co@xmath1 and hn@xmath0c , we assume that their flux density , and therefore , their abundances remain roughly constant across the shock .",
    "this is supported by the results of @xcite , in which hco@xmath1 and hnc are chemically inert after the disruption of the grain mantles into the gas phase by the passage of a c - shock .",
    "the initial column densities for these molecular species are @xmath34@xmath710@xmath58@xmath12@xmath59 @xcite , and as the line profiles of h@xmath0co@xmath1 and hn@xmath0c get broader with the evolution of the shock , their peak column densities , @xmath60 , are re - scaled following @xmath60=@xmath34@xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the variation of the neutral / ion velocity from one slab of gas to the next one , and @xmath63 is the total increase of the neutral / ion velocity from the beginning of the shock to the current slab of material in the shock .",
    "the excitation of h@xmath0co@xmath1 and hn@xmath0c has been derived by using the lvg approximation and the h@xmath17 collisional coefficients of @xcite .",
    "the line profiles are derived following the same procedure as that used for sio .",
    "finally , we assume that the emission of h@xmath0co@xmath1 and hn@xmath0c , as well as that of sio , has the same spatial extent and morphology .",
    "beam filling factors have not been considered in these calculations .",
    "the line intensities therefore depend on the size of the shocked region .    a bow - shock morphology for the shock may lead to substantial variations on the derived sio line profiles with respect to those calculated in the plane - parallel case .",
    "the planar geometry is however easier to handle in the calculation , and since the sio bullets in l1448-mm only show a partial bow - shock morphology ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the use of both model geometries are equally justified .",
    "in fig.@xmath12[f2 ] , we show the evolution of the line profiles of sio , h@xmath0co@xmath1 and hn@xmath0c obtained by _ freezing _ the propagation of two c - shocks , one with @xmath11=30@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 and the other with @xmath11=70@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 , at 5 different flow times ( see dots in fig.@xmath12[f1 ] ) . in order to directly compare our results with observations",
    ", we have included the preshock gas velocity , @xmath64 , in the calculation of the molecular line profiles .",
    "for the l1448-mm outflow ( sec.@xmath124 ) , we assume that @xmath64=4.7@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 and the inclination angle is @xmath30=70@xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the sio , h@xmath0co@xmath1 and hn@xmath0c line profiles of fig.@xmath12[f2 ] are then derived as a function of the radial velocity measured by the observer , @xmath66 .",
    "while for hn@xmath0c this velocity is @xmath66=@xmath67 , for h@xmath0co@xmath1 @xmath66 is @xmath68 . for sio , one may think that this molecular species would move with the ion fluid once it is ejected from grains .",
    "however , since sio is not coupled to the magnetic field , this molecule is rapidly slowed down by collisions with h@xmath17 to the velocities of the neutral fluid in time - scales , @xmath69 , of only few days . for a sio molecule @xmath70=@xmath71@xmath722@xmath7310@xmath4@xmath74@xmath18@xmath12sec@xmath16 .",
    "assuming @xmath18=10@xmath19@xmath12@xmath20 , @xmath75=10@xmath12k and @xmath76=0.7414@xmath12@xmath12 as the internuclear distance for a h@xmath17 molecule @xcite , the slow down time is @xmath69@xmath720@xmath12days .    from fig.@xmath12[f2 ] , we find that the sio emission generated in shocks has very different line shapes depending on the evolutionary stage of the shock .",
    "in particular , it is striking that the typical sio line profiles arising from the magnetic precursor at @xmath33=3@xmath12yrs , have very narrow linewidths of only @xmath70.5@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 and are slightly shifted in velocity ( @xmath775.2@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 ) with respect to the ambient cloud ( @xmath774.7@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 ) .",
    "the narrow linewidths of this emission are due to the low temperatures of the neutral fluid at the magnetic precursor stage ( @xmath15=10@xmath12k ; see fig.@xmath12[f1 ] ) , and the small velocity shift is explained by the fact that the sputtering of the grain mantles requires ion - neutral drift velocities of @xmath29@xmath56@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 to generate sio abundances of @xmath510@xmath4 .",
    "this occurs when h@xmath0co@xmath1 reaches velocities of @xmath66@xmath712@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 that imply @xmath29@xmath77@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 ( see fig.@xmath12[f1 ] ) .",
    "the peak intensity of the narrow sio line is 4 orders of magnitude larger for the @xmath11=70@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 shock ( 0.08@xmath12k vs. 2@xmath7310@xmath6@xmath12k ) due to the larger sio abundances ( @xmath710@xmath78 vs. 10@xmath8 ) injected from the grain mantles into the gas phase .",
    "this intensity is increased by only a factor of 3 if we consider that the fraction of silicon within the mantles is of 0.1% with respect to h@xmath17o ( i.e. 1 order of magnitude larger than that assumed in sec.@xmath122 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that only a fraction of the grain mantles ( @xmath250% ) is released into the gas phase for the same flow time of @xmath33=3@xmath12yrs .    for later flow times",
    ", the narrow sio feature is swept out by the larger efficiency of the sputtering of the grain cores once the velocity threshold of @xmath525@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 is overcome ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this enhances the gas phase abundances of sio by several orders of magnitude . for the 30@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 shock ,",
    "these abundances are of @xmath710@xmath78 and 10@xmath3 at @xmath33=10 and 20@xmath12yrs ( see j08 ) . for the 70@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 shock ,",
    "the sio abundances are enhanced up to 5@xmath7310@xmath6 and 7@xmath7310@xmath6 at @xmath33=13 and 22@xmath12yrs , respectively .",
    "the increase of @xmath15 with the propagation of the shock leads to larger peak intensities and broader sio line profiles .",
    "the sio emission subsequently develops double peaked line profiles .",
    "the lower velocity peak is centred at @xmath7712@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 for @xmath11=30@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 and at 32@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 for @xmath11=70@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 .",
    "this peak is correlated with the maximum ejection of silicon from the grain cores ( @xmath710@xmath3 and 7@xmath7310@xmath6 , i.e. 0.3% and 19% of all silicon locked in the cores for a 30@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16- and a 70@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16-shock , respectively ) , which happens as soon as the ion - neutral drift velocity reaches the threshold value of 25@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 . since the fraction of silicon released into the gas phase is larger for the 70@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 shock ( by almost a factor of 100 ) , the peak intensities therefore differ by more than 2 orders of magnitude from the @xmath11=30@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 shock .",
    "we note that the moderate velocity peak was also present in the @xcite and @xcite models , but averaged with and dominated by the brightest high velocity postshock emission .",
    "these moderate velocity profiles are similar in shape to those reported by @xcite for the young hh212 sio microjet and by @xcite in the ngc1333 outflows .",
    "the high velocity peaks at @xmath7730 and 70@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 ( @xmath33@xmath7500@xmath12yrs ; fig.@xmath12[f2 ] ) , are produced by the large accumulation of sio in the postshock wide layers ( slabs ) of gas .",
    "although the derived brightness temperatures are very high , this velocity component qualitatively resembles the sio line profiles obtained by @xcite and @xcite , and those observed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the lack of sio gas - phase chemistry or depletion onto grains in our model may account for the too strong emission predicted to arise from the high velocity postshock gas ( see sec.@xmath124 ) .",
    "we note that discrepancies in @xmath15 do exist between the fit profile calculated with our approximation and the solutions derived from comprehensive mhd models where @xmath15 increases earlier in the shock ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* see also fig.@xmath122 in j08 ) .",
    "this is not crucial for the precursor stage where mhd calculations predict an initial low - temperature _ plateau _ for @xmath15 ( with @xmath15@xmath710 - 20@xmath12k ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , for the moderate and high velocity components , the earlier increase of @xmath15 in the shock may produce significant variations in the peak intensity of the sio line profiles compared to our results .",
    "while for the 30@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 shock the sio peak intensity could be increased by only a factor of 2 , for the 70@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 shock this intensity could be _ enhanced _ by more than 1 order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , although _ quantitative _ results can not be given for the moderate and high velocity components , specially for the 70@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 shock ( also note that out model lacks of sio gas phase chemistry and freeze - out ; see sec.@xmath124 for a more detailed discussion ) , the _ qualitative _ behaviour of the sio line profiles is preserved .",
    "quantitative predictions of the sio line fluxes across the shock will be carried out in the future with a comprehensive mhd code including chemical processes .",
    "regarding the broadening of the sio lines , the earlier increase of @xmath15 in the shock does not substantially affect the derived linewidths of the sio line emission .",
    "indeed , for both cases with @xmath11=30@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 and @xmath11=70@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 , these linewidths differ by less than a factor of 1.4 from those shown in figure@xmath12@xmath79 at every evolutionary stage within the shock .    for h@xmath0co@xmath1 and hn@xmath0c , the differences in the line profiles of these species",

    "@xcite discussed the possibility that narrow sio could be generated by the evaporation of the icy grain mantles by the illumination of uv radiation in photon dominated regions , or pdrs @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of narrow sio emission with sio abundances of @xmath710@xmath8 toward a sample of pdrs such as the orion bar or s 140 .",
    "the linewidth of this emission is however of @xmath72 - 3@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 , a factor of @xmath75 broader than those measured toward l1448-mm .",
    "furthermore , hco , one of the main products of the uv photo - chemistry ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is not detected in the precursor component of this outflow , which allows to rule out the pdr origin for the narrow sio emission .",
    "alternatively , narrow sio emission may arise from an intervening cloud where turbulence motions of at least 6@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 would be efficient enough to erode the grain mantles and inject _ detectable _ abundances of sio into the gas phase .",
    "however , in contrast with the large - scale morphology expected from this scenario , the narrow sio emission is not widespread around l1448-mm as shown by the low upper limits of the sio abundance of @xmath210@xmath4 found in the regions with no precursor interaction @xcite .",
    "we note that these upper limits are of the same order of magnitude as those measured in the quiescent gas of the l183 dark cloud by the high - sensitivity 30@xmath12 m observations of @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the lack of sio emission toward these regions is caused by a real lack of sio in gas phase . from all this",
    ", we propose that the most likely explanation for the narrow sio lines detected toward l1448-mm , is the interaction of the magnetic precursor of c - shocks in very young outflows .",
    "the line profiles calculated across our parametric c - shock structure also suggest that the moderate and high velocity sio components observed toward l1448-mm are linked to later stages in the evolution of the shock . in fig.@xmath12[f4 ] , we show the comparison between the full sio line profile in l1448-mm ( lower panel ) , and the sio line emission predicted for a shock with @xmath11=70@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 and @xmath18=10@xmath19@xmath12@xmath20 at three different evolutionary stages ( black solid lines ) .",
    "the narrow sio emission is exactly the same as that shown in panel ( a ) of fig.@xmath12[f3 ] for @xmath33=3@xmath12yrs , and the moderate velocity component is reproduced by a c - shock at @xmath33=11@xmath12yrs .",
    "we note that the discrete nature of these two components is a direct consequence of the assumed chemical structure of dust grains : icy mantles surrounding the silicate / graphite cores , which have different binding energies ( of 0.53@xmath12ev and 50@xmath12ev for the mantles and the cores , respectively ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the high velocity gas emission is matched with a c - shock at @xmath33=440@xmath12yrs .",
    "although the model fails to reproduce the peak intensity of the moderate and high velocity sio components , the line shapes are _",
    "qualitatively _ similar to those observed in l1448-mm . at @xmath33=440@xmath12yrs",
    ", however , the moderate velocity emission shows an excess in intensity which is difficult to match with the observations .",
    "the facts that depletion of si / sio onto dust grains and/or that silicon gas - phase chemistry have not been taken into account in our model , could explain these discrepancies .",
    "including the depletion rate of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see eq.@xmath124 in this work ) with a sticking coefficient of @xmath71 , the depletion of sio onto dust grains reduces the abundance of this molecule by a factor of @xmath71.2 for intermediate flow times and by a factor of @xmath75 in the far postshock gas .",
    "more dramatically , the conversion of silicon into sio via gas - phase reactions with oh and o@xmath17 ( e.g. si+oh@xmath12@xmath82@xmath12sio+h and si+o@xmath17@xmath12@xmath82@xmath12sio+o ) is known to be not 100% efficient for high densities ( of @xmath18=10@xmath89 - 10@xmath28@xmath12@xmath20 ) , for which oh and o@xmath17 are partially destroyed by the atomic hydrogen generated in the shock @xcite .",
    "this may lead to significantly lower sio abundances ( by more than 1 order of magnitude ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than those obtained directly from the sputtering of dust grains .",
    "if we now consider that the gas - phase abundance of sio can not exceed @xmath710@xmath6 ( note that this is the maximum sio abundance estimated in l1448-mm ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sio line profile derived at @xmath33=440@xmath12yrs _ mimics _ the emission observed toward this outflow ( see red solid line in panel ( c ) of fig.@xmath12[f4 ] ) .",
    "the decrease of the gas - phase abundance of sio does not largely affect the sio lines calculated for the precursor and moderate velocity components at @xmath33=3 and 11@xmath12yrs , because the grain core sputtering is not efficient enough to inject sio abundances larger than 10@xmath6 ( see panels ( a ) and ( b ) in fig.@xmath12[f4 ] ) .",
    "beam filling factor corrections could also account for the different peak intensities obtained from the model for the moderate and high velocity emission of sio , assuming that both components show different spatial extents .",
    "high - angular resolution observations with interferometers such as the pdbi and the sma , are therefore strongly required not only to better constrain the initial conditions and the evolutionary stage of the different shocks suggested by the model , but also the chemical properties of the dust grains present in this star forming region .",
    "finally , shock velocities of 70@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 clearly exceeds the critical velocities of c - shocks ( of @xmath745 - 50@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have shown that these critical velocities can be increased to few @xmath7100@xmath12km@xmath12s@xmath16 for moderate h@xmath17 densities and high magnetic fields ( of few @xmath90 ) as those observed toward low mass star forming regions such as ngc1333 @xcite . however , we can not rule out the possibility that the high velocity sio emission toward l1448-mm is associated with a j - type discontinuity within the postshock gas in this outflow @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have modelled for the first time the expected evolution of the line profiles of sio , h@xmath0co@xmath1 and hn@xmath0c as c - shocks propagate through the ambient medium .",
