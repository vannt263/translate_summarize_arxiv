    "it is the most x - ray - luminous galaxy cluster known ( schindler et al .",
    "1995 ) , it shows a very peaked x - ray emission profile and presents a strong cooling flow in its central region .",
    "submm observations in its direction showed a very deep sz decrement ( komatsu et al . 1999 , 2001 ; pointecouteau et al . 1999 , 2001 ) .",
    "due to the presence of gravitational arcs , this cluster is also well suited for a comparison of lensing mass and x - ray mass .",
    "optical studies of weak lensing have been performed by fischer & tyson ( 1997 ) and sahu et al .",
    "recent _ chandra _ observations ( allen et al .",
    "2002 ) discovered a region of relatively hot , bright x - ray emission , located approximately 20 arcsec to the south - east of the main x - ray peak at a position consistent with the region of enhanced sz effect .",
    "we present the first results from an _ xmm - newton _ observation of rx j1347.5@xmath01145 , which was performed in july 2002 during rev .",
    "standard processing is applied to prepare data and reject the soft proton flares .",
    "the exposure times after cleaning are 32.2 ks for mos1 , 32.5 ks for mos2 and 27.9 ks for pn .",
    "the background estimates are obtained using a blank - sky observation consisting of several high - latitude pointings with sources removed ( lumb et al .",
    "the background subtraction ( for spectra and surface brightness profiles ) is performed as described in full detail in arnaud et al .",
    "the source and background events are corrected for vignetting using the weighted method described in arnaud et al .",
    "rx j1347.5@xmath01145 is at a redshift @xmath4 . with a hubble constant of @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ,",
    "the luminosity distance is 2506 mpc and the angular scale is 5.77 kpc per arcsec .",
    "since a morphological analysis indicates the presence of a substructure @xmath7 20 arcsec to the south - east ( se ) of the x - ray peak ( already revealed in previous observations with _",
    ", allen et al . 2002 ) , we perform the spectral analysis for the data excluding the se quadrant ( hereafter undisturbed cluster ) and for the full @xmath8 data , separately . in both cases ,",
    "the data are divided into the annular regions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and detailed in table 1 .",
    "a single spectrum is extracted for each region and then the data from the three cameras are modelled simultaneously using the xspec code , version 11.3.0 .",
    "spectral fitting is performed in the [ 0.5 - 8 ] kev band .",
    "the spectra are modelled using a simple , single - temperature model ( mekal plasma emission code in xspec ) with the absorbing column density fixed to the galactic value ( @xmath9 , dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "the free parameters in this model are the temperature @xmath10 , metallicity @xmath11 ( measured relative to the solar values ) and normalization ( emission measure ) . a typical simultaneous fit to the spectra extracted in each region",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2_3 ] .    the best - fitting parameter values and 90% confidence levels derived from the fits to the annular spectra",
    "are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the projected temperature profiles determined with this model from the data excluding the se quadrant and for the full @xmath8 data are shown in fig . [ fig4 ] .",
    "the temperature of the undisturbed cluster rises from a mean value of @xmath12 kev within 115 kpc to @xmath13 kev over the 0.1 - 0.5 mpc region , then declines down to a mean value of @xmath14 kev in the outer regions ( 1.0 - 1.7 mpc ) . as a general trend ,",
    "we note that the temperature of the undisturbed cluster is lower than that estimated from the full @xmath8 data , even though consistent within the errors .",
    "the derived temperature profile indicates the existence of a cool core : even though the gas temperature in the central 100 kpc is hotter than that usually found in cooling core clusters , there is probably a much cooler gas in the very center , which can not be resolved due to the relatively high cluster redshift .",

    "are in kev and metallicities ( @xmath11 ) in solar units .",
    "the total @xmath15 values and numbers of degrees of freedom ( dof ) in the fits are listed in columns 4 and 7 .",
    "errors are 90% confidence levels . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ profilot.tab ]    the metallicity profile is consistent with being constant , with an overall value of @xmath16 . within the radius of 1.7 mpc",
    ", a fit to the full 360@xmath17 data gives an overall @xmath18 kev , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .    in order to study in more detail the thermal structure of the cluster ,",
    "we extract the spectrum in the annular region including the substructure identified by the morphological analysis and compare the results in different directions .",
    "a fit to the data for the se quadrant between radii 50 - 200 kpc yields a best - fitting temperature @xmath21 kev , while in other directions the mean value is @xmath22 kev .",
    "therefore , the spectral analysis confirms that the region corresponding to the subclump seen in the x - ray image is significantly hotter than the surrounding gas .",
    "we compute a background - subtracted vignetting - corrected radial surface brightness profile for the undisturbed cluster in the [ 0.3 - 2 ] kev energy band . the surface brightness profile",
    "is then fitted with a @xmath23-model ( cavaliere & fusco femiano 1976 ) .",
    "we find that for 350 kpc - 1.7 mpc the data can be described by a @xmath23-model with a core radius @xmath24 kpc and a slope parameter @xmath25 .",
    "however , a single @xmath23-model is not a good description of the entire profile , as the fit to the outer regions shows a strong excess in the centre when compared to the model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the peaked emission is a strong indication for a cooling core in this cluster .",
    "the total gravitating mass distribution is calculated under the usual assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry using the deprojected density distribution calculated from the parameters of the @xmath23-model .",
    "only data beyond @xmath26 ( @xmath27 kpc ) are considered : in the central bins the temperature as estimated in sect .",
    "[ spectral.sec ] is affected by the _",
    "xmm _ psf and projection",
    "effects , while for the outer regions these effects can be neglected ( e.g. kaastra et al . 2004 ) . within 1 mpc",
    "we find a total mass of @xmath28 , while within 1.7 mpc the total mass is @xmath29 .",
    "these results are in agreement with _",
    "( allen et al . 2002 ) and weak lensing analysis ( fischer & tyson 1997 ) results and slightly higher than that derived by _ rosat / asca _ ( schindler et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ observation of rx j1347.5@xmath01145 confirms that it is , with a luminosity @xmath30 ( 2 - 10 kev energy band ) , the most x - ray - luminous cluster discovered to date .",
    "rx j1347.5@xmath01145 is a hot cluster ( overall temperature : @xmath2 kev ) , not isothermal : the temperature profile shows the presence of a cool core and a decline of the temperature in the outer regions .",
    "the spectral analysis identifies a relatively hot region at radii 50 - 200 kpc to the se of the main x - ray peak .",
    "this hot region is found at the same position as the subclump seen in the x - ray image . on the other hand , excluding the data of the se quadrant the cluster appears relatively relaxed and we estimate a total mass within 1 mpc of @xmath28 .",
    "this work is based on observations obtained with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
