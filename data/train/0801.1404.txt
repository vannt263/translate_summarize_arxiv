    "a high - speed analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) can greatly contribute to the frontier of radio astronomy .",
    "the performance of adc is very important because it decides the sensitivity of radio astronomical interferometric observations and the accuracy of astrometry observations and geodetic experiments . to realize the wideband observation for the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) , the 2-bit adc operating at the 4-ghz sampling rate",

    "this result shows that the realization of high frequency - resolution over a wide bandwidth is technically feasible @xcite .",
    "this is the first time to obtain such a wideband astronomical fringe from a _ single _ correlation product of digitized signals ; 20 line features can be found by a careful inspection of the spectrum .    in this paper ,",
    "the development of newly - developed 8-gsps 1-bit adc is described in section 2 , the measurement methods and the performance of the adc in section 3 , and the conclusion in section 4 .",
    "the 8-gbps 1-bit adc was developed with commercially available decision circuit ( dec ) and 1:16 demultiplexer ( dmux ) which are currently used as optical communication gaas ic chips at a bit rate of 10 gbps .",
    "these chips , dec ( oki kgl4215 ) and dmux ( oki k422c ) , have been developed for high - speed optical communication systems .",

    "the input signal power level is -20 dbm at the adc board end . in this adc board ,",
    "the input analog signals with a power of -20 dbm are amplified with amp ( quinstar technology qlj-04082530-jo ) , and then the power of the input signals to adc units becomes about @xmath1 dbm . after being amplified , the analog signals are sample - held and quantized at a sampling rate of 8192/4096 mhz with gaas dec chips , and then the quantized waveforms are digitized and demultiplexed with 1:16 dmux chips in the adc units .",
    "since the gaas dec chips have a response speed of 10 gsps , the newly - developed adc will be capable of covering the frequency range from 0 to 10 ghz . from the adc units , the digital signals paralleled to 16 bits by 1:16 dmux chips are output to the digital processing board ( fig .",

    "the adc board also outputs the reference clocks of if1 and if2 which are synchronized with digital signals .",
    "although these clocks are generated from the output signals of 1:16 dmux chip , the phase of if1 is not coherent with that of if2 because they are transmitted via different communication paths . in this adc board , this phase skew is absorbed in `` output control '' by selecting either of the reference clocks in  clock , timing control \" ( fig .",

    "phase stability of the adc was evaluated from derivation of the allan variance by measuring a phase variation between the stable reference signals and the digital - to - analog converted signals @xcite . however , since the measured results included the effects of the time skew in digital signal processing and the stability of the dac ( digital - to - analog converter ) , it was difficult to directly evaluate the phase stability or jitter time of the adc .    the measurement methods and results of the jitter time ,",
