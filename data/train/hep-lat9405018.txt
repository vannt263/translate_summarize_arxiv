    "in an earlier work  @xcite we have reported on a high statistics investigation of the effect of the symanzik tree improvement  @xcite , based on the study of the asymptotic scaling properties of the deconfinement transition in the @xmath3 pure gauge theory . in this letter",
    "we extend the analysis to the deconfinement transition in @xmath0 theory .",
    "our main purpose is a better understanding of the effect of the perturbative improvement in the context of @xmath4 dimensional gauge theories . in this respect",
    "the deconfinement temperature @xmath5 is an observable particularly well suited to give unambiguous answers .",
    "as early noticed  @xcite it can be accurately measured ; being a bulk effect it has a slow volume dependence and most importantly it is not affected by perturbative contributions which violate the scaling .",
    "we determine the critical coupling of the deconfinement transition in lattices with @xmath6 , and study the pattern of asymptotic scaling violation of @xmath5 , in comparison with the existing wilson action simulations ( for good reviews see  @xcite and references therein ) , both in the `` bare '' scheme and in the effective schemes based on the expectation values of plaquettes . in the bare scheme",
    "we find that the two lattice formulations give quite similar results , taking into account the redefinition of the @xmath7 scale , which corresponds to the perturbative prediction whitin @xmath8 .",
    "this is a confirmation that the wilson and symanzik actions are in the same universality class , and that the @xmath2 function is not affected , in the `` bare '' scheme , by the irrelevant operators connecting the two lattice formulations : on the other hand the results show further that with the currently accessible lattices the two - loop perturbative approximation is not sufficient to model the renormalization group flow in the scaling region . in sec .",
    "( [ sec : simul ] ) we give some details on our simulation and on the numerical results , discussing the consequences of an effective coupling parameterization . in sec .",
    "( [ sec : fss ] ) we discuss a test of our simulation , aimed to verify the first order nature of the deconfinement transition through a f.s.s .",
    "analysis on @xmath9 lattices .",
    "we have considered the @xmath0 gauge theory on asymmetric lattices using the lowest order tree improved symanzik action @xmath10 defined in order to remove @xmath11 scaling violations in the callan - symanzik equation for physical quantities measured on the lattice : we refer to our preceding work  @xcite and references therein for a more detailed discussion of the improvement strategies and of the results existing in literature .",
    "we have performed simulations on lattices @xmath12 ; the update is done with a combination of heat - bath and of overrelaxation sweeps applied to the @xmath3 subgroups  @xcite .",
    "all the data have been obtained on the ape machines installed in pisa , including a @xmath13 processors machine with a peak speed of 6 gigaflops .",
    "we have measured the order parameter of the deconfining transition , the spatial average of the polyakov line @xmath14 as usual  ( see for example  @xcite ) to consider the projection of this quantity on the nearest @xmath15 axis , @xmath16 in order to avoid the vanishing of the order parameter , on finite lattices , induced by the tunnelling between broken phases .",
    "we locate the deconfinement transition by studying the polyakov susceptibility @xmath17 which exhibits a clear peak structure , and the specific heat of the lattice action .",
    "the density of states method  @xcite has been used to extrapolate data coming from runs at different @xmath2 values and to combine them in a single curve : the data autocorrelation has been taken in account using a standard binning procedure , varying the bin size and testing the existence of a plateau in the variance of the binned quantities . in order to reduce the bias induced by the finite sample size we have used the techniques discussed in  @xcite : `` standard '' and `` jackknife '' estimators have been defined , combining them with coefficients appropriate to cancel the @xmath18 term in the bias . in fig .",
    "( [ fig:3x12 ] ) is given an example of the resummation of the polyakov susceptibility around the deconfining transition on the @xmath19 lattice , where the actual simulation values are addressed by a black square .",
    "a more extended discussion of the numerical simulation will be given elsewhere .",
    "12truecm    in tab .",
    "( [ tab : betac ] ) we report the values of the ( pseudo ) critical coupling on the different lattices , obtained by fitting the peaks with a gaussian curve , and the corresponding critical temperature in units of @xmath20 , obtained by means of the two loop r.g .",
    "formula @xmath21 they are also reported the corresponding quantities obtained in simulations using the wilson action  @xcite . in the last column",
    "the corresponding ratio of the @xmath7 parameters in the improved and standard formulation is listed , showing at @xmath22 a 10% discrepancy from the perturbative prediction  @xcite @xmath23    .@xmath24 values on different lattices [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : fss ]    in fig .",
    "( [ fig:3xv ] ) we compare the results for the polyakov line susceptibility : we note that the scaling of the peak is compatible with the characteristic behavior in presence of a first order phase transition @xmath25 most importantly for our purposes , we note that the shift of the pseudo - critical coupling corresponding to the peak of the transition is modest , giving confidence in the values and the errors quoted in tab .",
    "( [ tab : betac ] ) for the lattices with @xmath26 .",
    "in this work we have performed a study of the deconfinement phase transition in the pure gauge @xmath0 theory , using the symanzik tree improved action and determining the critical couplings on lattices with @xmath6 .",
    "the main conclusion is that , as in the case of the deconfinement transition in @xmath3 theory  @xcite , the same pattern of asymptotic scaling violation is observed .",
    "the asymptotic scaling violations are much reduced if the two loop perturbative expression is used in conjunction with effective couplings , based on uv dominated quantities like the plaquette expectation values , and comparison with the results of simulations with the wilson action , in this `` effective '' schemes , shows a slighlty precocious scaling , which is tempting to interpret as an effect of the improvement .",
    "although we do not have under control the systematical errors due to the finite volume , the analysis of the finite size behavior in the @xmath9 lattices makes us confident that the quoted results are not much affected by the finite size shift of the transition .",
