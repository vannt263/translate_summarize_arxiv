    "one of the most actively pursued strategies for detecting supersymmetric dark matter particles ( lsps ) is the search for signatures of the annihilations of lsps inside the sun or earth@xcite .",
    "the principle for detection is to search for the passage through a large detector in ice or water of muons produced by the interactions of energetic neutrinos released in the lsp dark matter annihilation process .",
    "there have been extensive studies of this potential experimental signature in many variants of the mssm , and experiments such as icecube / deepcore  @xcite are starting to chip away at the mssm parameter space .",
    "we recently re - analyzed  @xcite this potential signature in the framework of the mssm with all the supersymmetry - breaking spin-1/2 and -0 mass parameters @xmath0 constrained to be universal at the gut scale ( the cmssm ) @xcite , imposing the requirement that the lsp should provide the density of dark matter inferred from wmap @xcite and other experiments . in the cmssm , where the supersymmetry breaking trilinear mass parameters , @xmath1 are also taken to be universal at the gut scale",
    ", the resulting relic density is found to lie in the wmap range only along relatively narrow strips in the @xmath0 plane for fixed @xmath2 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "these correspond to the coannihilation strip , where the mass of the lightest neutralino is close to the mass of the lightest charged slepton ( usually the mostly right - handed stau ) ; the heavy higgs funnel , found at large @xmath2 and large @xmath0 , where the neutralino mass is close to half the heavy higgs mass and rapid annihilations of neutralinos are mediated by the s - channel exchange of heavy higgs scalars and pseudoscalars ; and the focus - point region which is typically found at very large values of @xmath3 when the @xmath4 parameter ( an output of the minimization of the higgs potential in the cmssm ) is driven to small values and the neutralino picks up a more significant higgsino component .    in our previous work @xcite , we found that the lsp capture rate was not in general dominated by scattering on protons inside the sun via spin - dependent couplings , but that an important role was often played by spin - independent scattering on heavier nuclides .",
    "we also found that , in many regions of the cmssm parameter space , lsp capture and annihilation would not be in equilibrium , and that the annihilation rate would be correspondingly reduced .",
    "we also analyzed the uncertainties in the magnitude of the potential muon - neutrino signal due to uncertainties in the composition of the sun and in the scattering matrix elements .",
    "we found that the cmssm might be detectable in icecube / deepcore along ( some part of ) the wmap strip in the focus - point region of the @xmath0 plane , and near the low-@xmath5 tip of the wmap strip in the coannihilation region @xcite .",
    "in this paper we extend these previous studies to models with one or two degrees of non - universality in the soft supersymmetry - breaking contributions to the higgs doublets , the nuhm1  @xcite and nuhm2  @xcite .",
    "one of our primary objectives is to understand the circumstances under which such relatively high neutrino fluxes may be attained in these models and , conversely , whether the relatively low rates usually found in the cmssm are specific to that model .",
    "more generally , we seek to lay a basis for systematic comparisons of the physics capabilities of different detection strategies in ( relatively ) simple variants of the mssm .",
    "supersymmetric dark matter searches  @xcite are complementary to searches for supersymmetry at accelerators  @xcite . at the moment , the latter are sensitive primarily to the spin-1/2 and -0 mass parameters @xmath5 and @xmath3 , and are less sensitive to the non - universality parameters that appear in the nuhm1,2 .",
    "for example , global likelihood fits @xcite currently yield similar 68 and 95% confidence - level preferred regions in the @xmath0 planes of the cmssm and nuhm1 .",
    "it is therefore particularly interesting to know whether direct and indirect dark matter searches offer ways to differentiate between these models .",
    "the nuhm1,2 offer additional mechanisms to bring the relic lsp density into the wmap range , in addition to the coannihilation , rapid - annihilation and focus - point possibilities mentioned above in the context of the cmssm .",
    "for example , there are distinctive regions of nuhm parameter space where higgsino - gaugino mixing in the lsp is enhanced by level - crossing in the neutralino mass matrix , bringing the relic density into the wmap range .",
    "alternatively , the lsps may annihilate rapidly through direct - channel heavy higgs @xmath6 poles even if @xmath7 and @xmath8 are relatively small .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the collider prospects for sparticle detection are rather different in the nuhm1 low - mass rapid - annihilation region than they are in the cmssm , whereas the favoured rates for direct lsp detection via scattering on nuclei were broadly similar in the cmssm and the nuhm1 ( though the uncertainties were greater in the latter case ) .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to study the prospects in this region for lsp detection via the energetic neutrinos produced by annihilation inside the sun .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : preamble ] we recall briefly some general features of the nuhm1,2 and discuss other inputs into the rate calculations .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : nuhm1 ] we explore the solar annihilation rates in some generic slices through the nuhm1 parameter space , finding that they are enhanced in regions with relatively large higgsino components in the lsp as may occur for specific relations between @xmath4 and @xmath5 where there is level crossing . in section",
    "[ sec : nuhm2 ] we extend our analysis to slices through the nuhm2 parameter space .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "we find that whereas the neutrino flux may be observable in regions with enhanced higgsino - gaugino mixing , analogously to the enhancement along the focus - point wmap strip in the cmssm , the flux is generically unobservably low in the rapid - annihilation funnels .",
    "this suggests that the observation of a high - energy solar neutrino flux in the icecube / deepcore experiment is a potential diagnostic for large mixing and level crossing in the neutralino mass matrix , and specifically of the relation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which is a potential tool for identifying non - universal higgs mass parameters .",
    "in the cmssm , the free parameters are the supposedly universal supersymmetry - breaking parameters @xmath7 and @xmath1 , as well as @xmath8 .",
    "the higgs mixing superpotential parameter @xmath4 and the bilinear supersymmetry - breaking parameter @xmath9 , and hence the pseudoscalar higgs mass @xmath10 , are then determined using the electroweak vacuum conditions , with a sign ambiguity in @xmath4 .",
    "the sign of the discrepancy between the experimental value of @xmath11 and the value calculated within the standard model suggests that @xmath12 , and cmssm analyses are often presented in @xmath0 planes for @xmath12 and fixed values of @xmath8 and @xmath1 .",
    "although much of our nuhm analysis is for @xmath12 , we also consider the possibility of a negative sign .",
    "the value of @xmath1 is notoriously unconstrained , see , _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite , and for definiteness we set it to zero in what follows .    in the nuhm1 , the soft supersymmetry - breaking contributions to the masses of the two mssm higgs doublets , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , are assumed to be equal , but are allowed to differ from @xmath3 .",
    "the extra degree of freedom may be used to treat either @xmath10 or @xmath15 as a free parameter . on the other hand , in the nuhm2 , the two soft supersymmetry - breaking contributions to the masses of the mssm higgs doublets are allowed to vary independently , and the two extra degrees of freedom may be used to treat both @xmath10 and @xmath15 as free parameters .",
    "analyses of the nuhm1 and nuhm2 parameter spaces are often presented in planes spanned by pairs of the quantities @xmath16 and @xmath4 for some fixed values of @xmath8 and the other parameters , and we present some examples below which are selected from the analysis in @xcite . since a frequentist likelihood analysis favours relatively small values of @xmath5 and @xmath3 in both the cmssm and nuhm1 @xcite , we concentrate here on nuhm1 and nuhm2 planes with relatively low values of either @xmath5 and @xmath3 .",
    "we note , however , that a complete likelihood analysis of the nuhm2 is yet to be performed .",
    "when calculating the lsp annihilation rates inside the sun , the key particle physics inputs ",
    "apart from the choice of supersymmetric model  are the matrix elements for dark matter scattering on the nuclides inside the sun .",
    "it is often assumed that lsp capture in the sun is dominated by spin - dependent scattering on hydrogen but , as discussed in  @xcite , spin - independent scattering on heavier nuclei actually dominates in generic regions of the cmssm parameter space .",
    "figure  [ fig : sds ] displays contours of the ratio of the solar dark matter annihilation rate calculated using only spin - dependent scattering to the total annihilation rate including also spin - independent scattering in ( left ) the cmssm @xmath0 plane for @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath12 , and ( right ) the nuhm1 @xmath0 plane for @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19  gev . regions excluded because there is no consistent electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) have dark pink shading , those with a charged lsp have brown shading , and those in conflict with @xmath20  @xcite measurements have green shading .",
    "regions to the left of the black dashed ( red dash - dotted ) line are inconsistent with the absence at lep of charginos ( a higgs boson ) @xcite .",
    "we recall that there is a theoretical uncertainty @xmath21  gev in the calculation of @xmath22 in the cmssm , which induces an uncertainty @xmath23  gev in values of @xmath5 along the red dash - dotted line .",
    "the recent lhc direct exclusion regions in the cmssm @xmath0 plane  @xcite are somewhat weaker than the indirect lep higgs constraint shown here .",
    "the pale pink band is favoured by the bnl measurement of @xmath11  @xcite , at the @xmath24 level along the dashed ( solid ) lines , but we do not impose this as a constraint on our analysis . in the cmssm case ( left panel ) , we see that spin - dependent scattering is dominant only at small @xmath5 and large @xmath3 . in the nuhm1 case ( right panel ) , we see that spin - dependent scattering is subdominant at small @xmath5 , becoming more important along the wmap - compatible strip with @xmath25  gev .",
    "however , spin - independent scattering is important even here , and in the following analysis all calculations of the annihilation rates include the contributions from both spin - dependent and -independent scattering .",
    "the uncertainties in the spin - independent scattering matrix element include those in the ratios of the light quark masses , the octet contribution , @xmath26 , to the pion - nucleon @xmath27 term , @xmath28 , and the value of @xmath28 itself @xcite .",
    "the largest uncertainty is due to @xmath28 , for which we used the value 64  mev as our default in  @xcite , whilst also exploring the implications of other values .",
    "the second - largest uncertainty is due to that in @xmath26 , for which we used the value 36  mev as our default .",
    "we assume the same default values in this analysis . as discussed in more detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , different measurements for @xmath28 and @xmath26 lead to variations in the spin - independent scattering cross - section by a factor of @xmath2923 and the choice of experimental values for these two parameters significantly impacts the spin - independent scattering contribution to capture in the sun .",
    "if @xmath28 were smaller , the total annihilation rate would decrease , and the ratio of the solar dark matter annihilation rate calculated using only spin - dependent scattering to the total annihilation rate including also spin - independent scattering shown in figure  [ fig : sds ] would increase . by comparison ,",
    "the uncertainties in the light quark mass ratios are much less significant .",
    "the principal uncertainty in the spin - dependent matrix element is the contribution of strange quarks to the nucleon spin , @xmath30 , with the uncertainties due to @xmath31 and the su(3)-octet nucleon matrix elements being significantly smaller .",
    "the range @xmath32 was considered in  @xcite , and was found to induce an uncertainty in the annihilation rate that was @xmath33% , considerably smaller than the others considered . in the following we take the central value @xmath34  @xcite , which was adopted in  @xcite as the default value .",
    "we compared in  @xcite the rates estimated in various alternative solar models .",
    "we found that there was at most a 4% difference in the annihilation rates between the two models of serenelli _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite ( agss09 and agss09ph ) based upon recent abundance estimates @xcite , and assumed the agss09 model as our default .",
    "we do the same here , performing a full numerical integration over the radial profile of the sun when determining the capture rates  .",
    "in modelling the dark matter halo , we assume a non - rotating isothermal sphere with an rms speed of 270  km / s , a disk rotation speed of 220  km / s , and a local dark matter density of 0.3  gev/@xmath35 . if the calculated neutralino relic density is below the wmap observed relic density , we assume that only a fraction of the local dark matter density , equal to the ratio of the neutralino and wmap dark matter relic densities , is attributable to neutralinos . as in  @xcite , we do not address other halo models in this paper , but note that our results would scale linearly with the local dark matter density as equilibrium between capture and annihilation is approached .",
    "however , as discussed extensively in  @xcite , equilibrium is not in general reached in the cmssm , and an example is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : capann ] , namely the @xmath0 plane for @xmath36 and @xmath12 .",
    "the dark blue contours are for different ratios of the annihilation and capture rates , and we see that equilibrium is reached only for small @xmath5 and large @xmath3 .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : capann ] shows the corresponding contours in the nuhm1 @xmath0 plane for @xmath36 and @xmath19  gev , where we see that equilibrium is approached only near a vertical strip with @xmath25  gev . in the following we",
    "calculate annihilation rates without relying on the assumption of equilibrium .",
    "the neutralino annihilations produce high - energy neutrinos which , through interactions with matter , will induce muons in or around a detector such as icecube / deepcore @xcite . the icecube detector has outfitted @xmath291  km@xmath37 of ice at the south pole with optical sensors to observe the cerenkov light produced by the passage of muons through the ice .",
    "the large volume allows for sensitivity to very low neutrino fluxes .",
    "however , the relatively large spacing between sensors severely limits the sensitivity to lower energy muons ( below 100  gev ) which are the largest portion of the neutrino - induced muon spectra arising from annihilations in the sun . to improve",
    "the sensitivity to these important lower - energy muons , a portion of the icecube volume , referred to as deepcore , has been outfitted with more densely packed sensors .",
    "the ability of icecube / deepcore to detect the flux from a given supersymmetric model depends on various factors such as the muon spectra , the neutrino backgrounds , and the method by which icecube / deepcore will analyze their results .",
    "however , to a very rough approximation , icecube can detect muon fluxes on the order of 10 or 10@xmath38  /km@xmath38/yr above @xmath29100  gev and deepcore can detect muon fluxes on the order of 10@xmath38 or 10@xmath37  /km@xmath38/yr above @xmath2910  gev . in this paper",
    ", we primarily examine the latter case : total fluxes above 10  gev .",
    "deepcore can detect muons down @xmath2910  gev ; however , the analysis threshold may turn out to be somewhat higher : ref .",
    "@xcite suggests an analysis threshold of @xmath2935  gev is reasonable , while ref .",
    "@xcite suggests 2530  gev is more likely ( but possibly as low as 20  gev).10  gev  is sufficient to detect a muon .",
    "however , two - module events suffer from extremely poor angular resolution .",
    "muons that trigger three optical modules ( which requires somewhat higher muon energies ) yield much better track reconstruction and allow the analysis to be restricted to muons consistent with neutrinos coming from the direction of the sun . ] in addition , the efficiency of detecting muons ( or , equivalently , the effective area of the detector ) falls with decreasing muon energy .",
    "our results are not significantly affected by our choice of a 10  gev threshold as we use only an order - of - magnitude estimate of the icecube / deepcore sensitivity to the total muon flux above this energy .",
    "our results are only affected if the flux is predominantly just above threshold ( _ e.g. _  between 10 and 25  gev ) , which is only expected to be the case for very light neutralinos ( @xmath39  gev or @xmath40  gev ) .",
    "we use the results of the wimpsim simulation @xcite ( as used within darksusy  @xcite ) to calculate the spectra of the neutrinos produced by the annihilations and the corresponding spectra of neutrino - induced muons in icecube / deepcore .",
    "more details of the neutralino capture / annihilation processes and the determination of the neutrino / muon fluxes may be found in ref .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : m12m0 ] displays the neutrino - induced muon fluxes calculated in the @xmath0 plane for the typical cmssm scenario with @xmath36 and @xmath12 introduced above .",
    "we recall that this plane has two narrow strips where the lsp density falls within the range allowed by wmap and other measurements  @xcite , which are coloured turquoise .",
    "one is the coannihilation strip close to the boundary of the forbidden charged - lsp region at low @xmath3 , and the other is the focus - point strip close to the ewsb boundary at large @xmath3 .         as was discussed extensively in  @xcite and shown in the left panel of figs .",
    "[ fig : sds ] &  [ fig : capann ] , at large @xmath5 it is usually not appropriate to assume that the lsp capture cross - section is dominated by spin - dependent interactions , nor that there is equilibrium between capture and annihilation . accordingly , as already mentioned , neither assumption is made in this and subsequent plots .",
    "the solid ( blue ) lines are contours of the neutrino - induced muon fluxes above 10  gev in units of events / km@xmath38/yr . as seen in the left panel of figure  [ fig : m12m0 ] , the neutrino rate is potentially detectable in icecube / deepcore along a significant stretch of the focus - point strip , but apparently undetectable along the portion of the coannihilation strip that is compatible with the lep higgs constraint . as discussed in  @xcite ,",
    "the neutrino fluxes in the cmssm are generally larger for @xmath41 along the coannihilation strip ( though still not observable in icecube / deepcore ) , and smaller along the focus - point strip than they are for the @xmath17 case shown .",

    "there is also a near - vertical extension of the coannihilation strip at @xmath25  gev , that appears thanks to the freedom in the nuhm1 of independently adjusting the @xmath4 parameter .",
    "it occurs along a line where a particular relation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 induces level crossing in the neutralino mass matrix as @xmath5 is increased relative to @xmath4 , and thereby leads to increased higgsino - gaugino mixing that brings the lsp density down into the wmap range . to the right of this strip",
    ", the relic density falls below the wmap range .",
    "this strip is the only part of this particular nuhm1 plane where the neutrino - induced muon flux approaches detectability in icecube / deepcore , rising above 30  /km@xmath38/yr , thanks to the enhanced higgsino - gaugino mixing .",
    "one of the key questions in our analysis will be the extent to which the freedom in the nuhm1,2 to vary @xmath4 and/or @xmath10 provides this and other opportunities for icecube / deepcore detection of neutrinos that are absent in the cmssm .",

    "as we have seen before , equilibrium is established and spin - dependent scattering is dominant along the transition strip near the ewsb boundary , in contrast to the funnel regions where equilibrium is not established and spin - independent scattering is dominant .",
    "+       turning now to the lower row of plots in figure  [ fig : mam12planes ] for ( left ) @xmath55 and ( right ) @xmath57 , both with @xmath48  gev , we see that the ewsb boundary is broadly similar , whereas the region forbidden by @xmath20 is much reduced .",
    "the wmap - compatible rapid - annihilation funnel is clearly visible for @xmath55 , but folds into the ewsb boundary strip for @xmath57 . as in the previous cases , the neutrino flux is unobservably small along the rapid - annihilation funnel , but may be observable along the ewsb boundary strip for @xmath55 .",
    "we note that a portion of the icecube / deepcore - friendly region for @xmath55 is favoured by @xmath11 . for @xmath41 ,",
    "muon fluxes are @xmath70  /km@xmath38/yr for @xmath71  gev along the transition / funnel and compatible with @xmath53 .",
    "we note that this case is also interesting because in much of the allowable plane capture is dominated by spin - independent scattering .",
    "figure  [ fig : mam0planes ] shows some sample nuhm1 @xmath72 planes with fixed @xmath8 that exhibit rapid - annihilation funnels . in these cases ,",
    "the funnels appear as essentially vertical double strips on either side of the line where @xmath73 . in each case",
    ", we also note the presences of wmap - compatible strips close to the ewsb boundary where @xmath74 .",
    "the two are attached by coannihilation strips at @xmath63  gev . when @xmath60  gev , coannihilation to the left of the funnel at low @xmath10 is dominated by selectrons / smuons which are the lsps in the lower left corners . in the upper left panel for @xmath43 and @xmath59  gev",
    ", we also see a region at low @xmath3 that is favoured by @xmath75 , but this is in a region disfavoured by the lep higgs limit . in this plane ,",
    "the only wmap - compatible region allowed by the other constraints is up the funnel at large @xmath3 , where the neutrino flux in unobservably low . in the upper right panel for @xmath60  gev , the higgs constraint is irrelevant , but the neutrino flux is still very low in all the wmap - compatible region except along the strip close to the ewsb boundary .",
    "the same is true in the lower left plot for @xmath55 and @xmath60  gev , where we note that a part of this strip is inside the region favoured by @xmath11 .",
    "however , as shown in the lower right plot , when @xmath8 is increased to 55 with the same value of @xmath5 , the ewsb boundary moves so close to the rapid - annihilation funnel that there is no icecube / deepcore - friendly region .",
    "+        we have found in the above analysis that interesting neutrino fluxes may arise from enhanced higgsino - gaugino mixing .",
    "this possibility arose in the cmssm in the focus - point region along the ewsb boundary , but may arise in regions of the nuhm1 parameter space that are far from this boundary , corresponding in general to larger values of @xmath5 .",
    "the ewsb boundary region may also yield interesting fluxes when @xmath76 at the boundary .",
    "one of the other mechanisms present in the nuhm1 for bring the relic lsp density into the wmap - compatible range is rapid annihilation through direct - channel higgs poles .",
    "however , we have found that this region generally yields low neutrino fluxes .",
    "as discussed earlier , in the nuhm2 we are free to adjust both soft higgs masses independently and as a consequence we can study models for which both @xmath4 and @xmath10 are free parameters  @xcite .",
    "we first consider some @xmath77 planes for @xmath78  gev and @xmath79  gev as shown in figure  [ fig : muma300100planes ] . in each case",
    ", we see a wmap - compatible rapid - annihilation funnel at @xmath80  gev as the neutralino mass is roughly 0.43  @xmath5 and therefore roughly half the pseudoscalar mass across the plane . in addition",
    "there is an arc at relatively large @xmath4 and @xmath10 due to the coannihilations between the neutralino and sneutrinos .",
    "the dark blue shaded regions have a sneutrino lsp and are excluded  @xcite . in the left panel for @xmath17 , we also see a near - vertical strip at low @xmath4 where the lsp has a substantial higgsino component , which extends downwards in a stau coannihilation strip almost parallel to the charged dark lsp boundary .",
    "the @xmath12 half of the plane is consistent with the @xmath53 constraint . as we have seen before , equilibrium is in this case well established along the vertical transition strip , partially established along the horizontal funnel , and not at all along the arcing coannihilation strip .",
    "while scattering is heavily dominated by the spin - dependent cross - section along the transition strip , spin - independent scattering is significant along the other two strips . in the right panel for @xmath41 ,",
    "the charged lsp boundary is present at lower @xmath4 and more prevalent at large @xmath10 .",
    "both the stau and sneutino lsp regions are again parallelled by wmap - compatible coannihilation strips .",
    "the supersymmetric contribution to @xmath53 in the right panel exceeds the 2@xmath27 bound .         in the left plane ,",
    "the only region with an icecube / deepcore - friendly neutrino flux is the vertical strip with a substantial higgsino content , analogous to those seen previously in our nuhm1 analysis . here",
    "fluxes are in excess of 500  /km@xmath38/yr . on the other hand , in the right panel where this strip has disappeared",
    ", the only icecube / deepcore - friendly region is at small @xmath4 and @xmath10 , below the rapid - annihilation funnel .",
    "we further note that , in both planes , the higgs mass falls below 114  gev .",
    "similar trends can be seen in figure  [ fig : muma500300planes ] for @xmath81  gev and @xmath47  gev . in the left panel for @xmath17 , we see a near - vertical strip where the lsp has an enhanced higgsino component , split in two by a near - horizontal rapid - annihilation funnel .",
    "this funnel is also present in the right panel for @xmath41 , and splits a diagonal coannihilation strip close to the charged lsp boundary .",
    "again , as in the previous case for smaller @xmath5 and @xmath3 , the only icecube / deepcore - friendly regions are in the higgsino - like strip at small @xmath4 for @xmath17 , and for very small @xmath4 and @xmath10 for @xmath41 .",
    "spin - independent scattering becomes dominant for @xmath82  gev when @xmath17 and is dominant everywhere in the displayed plane for @xmath41 . in this case , the higgs mass is above 114  gev everywhere above the red dot dashed curved found at low @xmath10 . for @xmath17 ,",
    "the supersymmetric contribution to @xmath53 is too small across the plane , whereas for @xmath41 it lies within the experimental range .         finally , we present some @xmath83 planes in figs .  [",
    "fig : m1m2300100planes ] and  [ fig : m1m2500300planes ] , for @xmath59  gev , @xmath79  gev and @xmath60  gev , @xmath47  gev , respectively . in each case , we assume @xmath18 and the left panel is for @xmath17 and the right panel for @xmath41 .",
    "the ranges of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are symmetric @xmath84  gev , except for the right panel of figure  [ fig : m1m2300100planes ] , where asymmetric ranges @xmath85  gev are chosen so as to display better the regions not excluded by the ewsb constraint ( pink ) and the sneutrino lsp regions ( blue ) or the charged - lsp constraint ( brown ) .",
    "the signs shown for @xmath86 actually refer to the sign of @xmath87 as they are run in the rges .",
    "as these are gut scale parameters , negative values may indicate a cosmological issue with broken symmetric vacua .",
    "for a recent discussion of this issue in the nuhm , see @xcite .         in the left panel of figure  [ fig : m1m2300100planes ] for @xmath17 , we see two narrow wmap strips following the top left and bottom right boundaries of the allowed lozenge of the @xmath83 plane . of these ,",
    "the former has an icecube / deepcore - friendly neutrino - induced muon flux over most of its length , rising to @xmath56 events / km@xmath38/yr for @xmath88  gev .",
    "note that the nearly horizontal part of the strip corresponds again to the transition strip where a there significant higgsino contribution to the neutralino composition .",
    "the more vertical part of the strip corresponds to the rapid annihilation funnel . on the other hand ,",
    "the bottom right wmap strip corresponding to neutralino - sneutrino coannihilation generally has an unobservably small neutrino flux , except for positive values of @xmath14 , where the muon flux may reach @xmath89 events / km@xmath38/yr . as usual",
    ", the larger neutrino fluxes are reached when the higgsino component of the lsp is enhanced . in this plane the @xmath53 constraint is satisfied , though the higgs mass is low .    in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : m1m2300100planes ] for @xmath41 , the allowed region of the @xmath83 plane has receded to more negative values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and the two narrow wmap strips are squeezed closer together . additionally , we note that the top left strip has bifurcated along the two sides of a rapid - annihilation funnel , whereas the lower right strip follows either the stau or sneutrino coannihilation boundaries . as in the left panel of figure  [ fig : m1m2300100planes ] ,",
    "the neutrino fluxes are generally more favourable along the top left strip , though they also become more icecube / deepcore - friendly towards the upper end of the other strip , near their junction . neither @xmath53 or the higgs mass constraints are satisfied in this plane .",
    "in the left panel of figure  [ fig : m1m2500300planes ] for @xmath17 , we see a single narrow wmap strip following the top boundary of the allowed region of the @xmath83 plane corresponding to the transition strip . as in the corresponding panel of figure",
    "[ fig : m1m2300100planes ] , the neutrino - induced muon flux is largest , exceeding @xmath90 events / km@xmath38/yr and hence quite icecube / deepcore - friendly , in the top part of the strip close to the ewsb boundary where @xmath91  gev and the lsp has an enhanced higgsino component .",
    "the left boundary corresponds to the the funnel region where there are two strips , one of which continues on to the vertical transitions strip .",
    "the upper part of the funnel still has observable fluxes , but these quickly drop as @xmath14 is decreased . here , and in the right panel as well , equilibrium is established along all wmap strips , however spin - dependent scattering is sub - dominant almost everywhere in the plane .         in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : m1m2500300planes ] for @xmath41 , the previous single narrow wmap strip has again bifurcated along the two sides of a rapid - annihilation funnel , and has moved away from the boundaries of the allowed region of the @xmath83 plane . once again , the neutrino flux is largest for @xmath92 , though generally lower than in the left panel of figure  [ fig : m1m2500300planes ] ( where @xmath2 is smaller ) or in the right panel of figure  [ fig : m1m2300100planes ] ( where @xmath5 and @xmath3 are smaller ) , and only barely icecube / deepcore - friendly . in this plane , both the @xmath53 and higgs mass constraints are satisfied .",
    "in our previous analysis of the cmssm , we found that the flux of high - energy neutrinos from lsp annihilations inside the sun was likely to be observable along the focus - point wmap strip , where the higgsino component of the lsp is enhanced , and at the tip of the coannihilation wmap strip where the lsp is relatively light . on the other hand",
    ", there were significant portions of the wmap - compatible strips in parameter space , particularly along the coannihilation strip and heavy - higgs rapid - annihilation funnels , where the the neutrino flux was not icecube / deepcore - friendly .",
    "we find some similar features in our analyses of the nuhm1 and nuhm2 .",
    "specifically , there are significant portions of the wmap strips where the high - energy solar neutrino flux is unlikely to be observable with icecube / deepcore . in these models ,",
    "icecube / deepcore - friendly fluxes are often found in regions where the lsp has an enhanced higgsino component , and this occurs under circumstances that can not be realized in the cmssm .",
    "specifically , it may occur for larger lsp masses than along the focus - point strip of the cmssm : see , for example , the right panel of figure  [ fig : m12m0 ] , the first three panels of figure  [ fig : mum12planes ] , and the first three panels of figure  [ fig : mum0planes ] .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that icecube / deepcore has interesting prospects for probing aspects of the nuhm1 and nuhm2 parameter spaces .",
    "however , it seems clear that a more complete exploration of these models , capable of measuring a high - energy neutrino flux when the lsp is relatively heavy and/or does not have a large higgsino component , would require a subsequent generation of experiment . on the other hand",
    ", one may hope that forthcoming lhc results and/or direct searches for lsp scattering could provide more encouraging indications on the prospects for searches for supersymmetric dark matter via annihilation into high - energy solar neutrinos .",

    "<S> we extend our previous studies of the neutrino fluxes expected from neutralino lsp annihilations inside the sun to include variants of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) with squark , slepton and gaugino masses constrained to be universal at the gut scale , but allowing one or two non - universal supersymmetry - breaking parameters contributing to the higgs masses ( nuhm1,2 ) . as in the constrained mssm ( cmssm ) with universal higgs masses , </S>",
    "<S> there are large regions of the nuhm parameter space where the lsp density inside the sun is not in equilibrium , so that the annihilation rate may be far below the capture rate , and there are also large regions where the capture rate is not dominated by spin - dependent lsp - proton scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra possible in the nuhm are qualitatively similar to those in the cmssm . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate neutrino - induced muon fluxes above a threshold energy of 10  gev , appropriate for the icecube / deepcore detector , for points where the nuhm yields the correct cosmological relic density for representative choices of the nuhm parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the icecube / deepcore detector can probe regions of the nuhm parameter space in addition to analogues of the focus - point strip and the tip of the coannihilation strip familiar from the cmssm . </S>",
    "<S> these include regions with enhanced higgsino - gaugino mixing in the lsp composition , that occurs where neutralino mass eigenstates cross over . on the other hand , rapid - annihilation funnel regions in general yield neutrino fluxes that are unobservably small .    </S>",
