    "traffic flow , a many body system of strongly interacting vehicles , shows various complex behaviors .",
    "numerous empirical data of the highway traffic have been obtained@xcite , which demonstrate the existence of distinct dynamic states and dynamic phase transitions between them .",
    "recent studies reveal physical phenomena such as hysteresis , self - organized criticality , and phase transitions in the traffic flow @xcite .",
    "the transition from the homogeneous free flow to the jammed state has been studied by microscopic and macroscopic models without any inhomogeneity in the system @xcite .",
    "the traffic jam , one of the dynamic phases of the traffic flow , appears spontaneously when the vehicle density is between the two critical values @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "the traffic jam , however , can appear even below @xmath2 .",
    "the traffic jam can be triggered by localized perturbations provided that the density is larger than a different critical value @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) . as a result , in the density range between @xmath5 and @xmath2 , both the free flow and the traffic jam can exist , resulting in metastability and hysteresis@xcite .",
    "it is observed that some features of the traffic jam are uniquely determined by underlying dynamics , and independent of initial conditions of the traffic flow that lead to the jam@xcite .",
    "the presence of such characteristic features is also reproduced by analytic and numerical studies of traffic flow models@xcite .",
    "the synchronized traffic flow , another dynamic phase of the traffic flow , is identified in recent measurements on highways @xcite .",
    "the synchronized traffic flow resembles the traffic jam in the sense that both states produce inhomogeneous density and flow profiles .",
    "the dynamics of the synchronized flow is however much more complicated than that of the traffic jam .",
    "one notable property of the synchronized traffic flow is the high level of its average flow , which almost matches the flow of the free flow state .",
    "the synchronized traffic flow is observed , in nearly all occasions , localized near ramps and it is thus believed that ramps are important for the stability of the synchronized traffic flow .",
    "the discontinuous transition from the free flow to the synchronized flow can be induced by localized perturbations of finite amplitudes .",
    "measurements show a hysteresis effect in the phase transitions between the free flow and the synchronized flow : the transition from the synchronized flow to the free flow occurs at a lower on - ramp flux , or lower upstream flux , than that for the reverse transition . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the recurring hump ( rh ) state is proposed as an origin of the ( nonstationary type ) synchronized traffic flow @xcite , and the dynamic phase transitions between the rh state and the free flow are investigated using continuum traffic equations that take into account the effect of ramps . in the rh state ,",
    "the vehicle density and the velocity show temporal oscillations which are localized near on - ramps . that the synchronized flow is maintained for several hours",
    "can be explained from one important property of the rh state , its being a limit cycle of the traffic equations .",
    "the rh state can be characterized as a self - excited oscillator , where constant vehicle flux from an on - ramp serves as a source of the repeated excitation and each excitation is subsequently relaxed within a localized region .",
    "the traffic equations also describe the hysteresis phenomena between the rh state and the free flow .",
    "the traffic jam and the synchronized traffic flow are distinct phases of traffic flow .",
    "however , the distinction between the conditions for the appearance of the jam state and the synchronized flow is not clearly identified yet , both in measurements and in model studies .",
    "highway measurements analysis reports that almost identical initial states of the traffic flow can evolve to both the traffic jam and the synchronized flow @xcite .    to describe the hysteretic phase transitions between the free flow and the synchronized flow , a different macroscopic model based on a gas - kinetic approach",
    "is also proposed @xcite . in this model ,",
    "a peak of the inflow from an on - ramp produces a congested but homogeneous region near the on - ramp , which spreads in the upstream direction .",
    "this homogeneous congested traffic ( hct ) state is proposed as an explanation for the ( stationary type ) synchronized traffic flow @xcite .",
    "the subsequent study @xcite investigated the phase diagram of the model and identified additional dynamic phases such as the standing localized cluster ( slc ) , the triggered stop and go ( tsg ) , and the oscillating congested traffic ( oct ) states .",
    "analytical conditions for the existence of these phases are provided and it is suggested that the phase diagram is universal for a class of traffic models .",
    "the study is however restricted to the traffic states generated from a particular initial condition and thus important issues such as multistability and hysteresis are not addressed .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the phase diagram of the traffic flow in the presence of an on - ramp using a different continuum model @xcite , which tests the idea of the universal phase diagram .",
    "various traffic states in ref .",
    "@xcite are reproduced .",
    "however , the phase diagram is found to be qualitatively different .",
    "for instance , some traffic states , which represent distinct phases in ref .",
    "@xcite , make smooth crossovers to other traffic states without any sharp phase boundaries in between , implying that they are different limiting behaviors of a single dynamic phase .",
    "the investigation is also performed for a large variety of initial conditions using two effective search methods .",
    "the conditions for the stable existence of the free flow , the rh state , and the traffic jam are examined . in some parameter ranges",
    ", it is found that multiple dynamic phases can remain stable with respect to sufficiently small perturbations . in such parameter ranges",
    ", finite perturbations may induce transitions between those phases , resulting in metastability . due to the presence of the on - ramp",
    ", the evolution process of the jam shows several different patterns and the phase boundaries for the formation of the jam are significantly modified .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we investigate the possible traffic phases for given values of the upstream flux and the input flux through the on - ramp .",
    "various new features are discovered , which are absent in homogeneous highways .",
    "we examine the conditions for the stabilities of the traffic jam and the rh state .",
    "the metastability among the free flow , the rh state , and the traffic jam is investigated , and the travel time distributions of the three states are compared .",
    "we also discuss the several different evolution processes of the jam due to the presence of the on - ramp . based on the phase diagrams",
    ", we find that the on - ramp flux becomes a more important factor for the formation of the traffic jam than the total flux , the sum of the on - ramp flux and the upstream flux . in sec .",
    "iii , we demonstrate analytically that our macroscopic model possesses nontrivial solutions which are indeed found in numerical simulations . finally , sec .",
    "iv summarizes our results .",
    "in this work , we adopt the continuum model of the highway traffic flow proposed by kerner and konhuser @xcite , @xmath7 -c^2_0 \\ { \\partial \\rho \\over \\partial x } + \\mu { \\partial^2 v \\over \\partial x^2 } \\ , \\label{eq : eqofmotion2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the local vehicle density and @xmath9 the local velocity .",
    "@xmath10 is the source term representing the external flux through an on - ramp .",
    "the spatial distribution of the external flux @xmath11 is localized near @xmath12 ( on - ramp position ) and normalized so that @xmath13 denotes the total incoming flux .",
    "@xmath14 is the safe velocity that is achieved in the time - independent and homogeneous traffic flow . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqofmotion2 ] ) , the second term on the right hand side represents an effective `` pressure '' gradient on vehicles due to the anticipation driving @xcite and the velocity fluctuations @xcite , and the third term takes into account an intrinsic dampening effect that is required to fit the experimental data @xcite . here",
    "@xmath15 are appropriate constants .",
    "the flux or flow , @xmath16 , is denoted below by either @xmath17 or @xmath18 .    in order to investigate the effects of a single on - ramp",
    ", we use the open boundary condition .",
    "the upstream boundary values of the density and velocity are fixed at @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively . on the other hand , the values at the downstream boundary ( @xmath21 )",
    "are linearly extrapolated from their values at neighboring points , @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 is spacing used in the discretization .",
    "the numerical simulations are performed using the two - step lax - wendroff scheme@xcite .",
    "we choose the following parameters : @xmath25 0.5 min , @xmath26 600 vehicles km / h , @xmath27 km / h , and @xmath28 where the maximum density @xmath29 140 vehicles / km , @xmath30 km / h , and @xmath31 @xcite . concerning the discretization ,",
    "spatial intervals of @xmath32 m and time intervals of @xmath33 min are used .",
    "we choose the spatial distribution of the external flux as @xmath34 with @xmath35 m. with this choice of parameters , critical values are @xmath36 vehicles / km , @xmath2=25.3 vehicles / km , @xmath3=62.3 vehicles / km , @xmath37 vehicles / h , @xmath38 vehicles / h , and @xmath39 vehicles / h .",
    "the maximum flow that can be achieved in the time - independent homogeneous flow is @xmath40 vehicles / h .",
    "below we are interested mainly in the low density regime ( @xmath41 ) , and thus we will use for brevity the subscript c in place of c1 .    in the real highway traffic , there are many kinds of noises which perturb the traffic out of its steady states .",
    "the real traffic state is hence under an infinite sequence of perturbations and subsequent responses of dynamic states .",
    "previous studies @xcite on highway traffic without ramps however showed that many observed features of the traffic flow can be explained from the steady state properties of the continuum model without any noise .",
    "motivated by previous successes , we will ignore noises in this paper .    in the absence of noises , each dynamic phase of the traffic flow",
    "corresponds to a steady state , or equivalently an attractor of the nonlinear hydrodynamic model [ eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eqofmotion1],[eq : eqofmotion2 ] ) ] .",
    "a steady state may exhibit complicated time dependences depending on the nature of the corresponding attractor .",
    "we examine in this section the linearly stable steady states ( or phases of traffic flow ) for a given upstream flux @xmath42 and the vehicle flux @xmath43 through the on - ramp at @xmath12 .",
    "linearly stable states are , however , often unstable to large perturbations and multistability can occur .",
    "here it is worth emphasizing that the concept of the multistability in dynamic systems is somewhat different from that in equilibrium systems . in equilibrium systems",
    "the free energy selects one particular state as a `` true '' stable state and other states become metastable . in dynamic systems , on the other hand , the free energy can not be defined and the concept of the `` true '' stable state is not applicable . in this sense , all states are metastable and they all should be treated equally . possible presence of multiple steady states makes it very difficult to search completely for all phases that are stable for given parameters , since it requires examinations of many different initial conditions . to search out all multiple steady states , we use two methods : one is to apply a triggering pulse to a steady state , for example , by changing the value of @xmath1 for a short time . for a sufficiently strong pulse",
    ", a transition to a different steady state can be induced , allowing the identification of a new steady state .",
    "the other is the adiabatic sweeping method . starting with a given steady state for a particular set of the system parameters , one increases or decreases one parameter adiabatically .",
    "this way , one can find the range of the parameter values where a dynamic state remains stable .",
    "these two methods effectively simulate a large variety of initial conditions . using these",
    ", we investigate the steady states for given system parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , we concentrate on three representative values of @xmath0 , and for each of them construct a phase diagram for the entire range of @xmath1 . however , since too large a value of @xmath1 is unrealistic , we restrict our attention to the range @xmath44 .",
    "the values of @xmath0 studied in this work are chosen from the following considerations . in the previous studies of homogeneous highways without ramps , it was found that the flux @xmath45 provides an important boundary . whereas the free flow is the only stable phase below @xmath45 , the traffic jam can be created above this value . in the presence of ramps",
    ", one can expect that the appearance of the traffic jam depends on whether the upstream flux @xmath0 is larger or smaller than @xmath45 .",
    "( below we show that this expectation is not true , due to the nontrivial effect of an on - ramp . )",
    "this property motivated us to choose one representative value of @xmath0 in the range larger than @xmath45 and another smaller .",
    "we also choose a very small value for @xmath46 , which later reveals the importance of @xmath1 on the formation of the congested traffic .",
    "the phase diagram of the traffic states for @xmath48 vehicles / h appears in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase](a ) . here",
    "@xmath49 is the critical input flux through the on - ramp above which the free flow in the downstream of the on - ramp becomes linearly unstable .",
    "the critical on - ramp flux @xmath49 is determined from @xmath50 where @xmath51 . for @xmath52 , the flux ,",
    "both in the upstream and downstream , is lower than @xmath53 but higher than @xmath45 .",
    "hence the traffic jam can be created from the free flow by triggering events but it does not appear spontaneously .",
    "the finite amplitude perturbation to @xmath1 generates a cluster , which grows to a traffic jam since the upstream flux is larger than @xmath45 .",
    "the traffic jam propagates to the upstream with its characteristic group velocity .    when @xmath54 , the flux of the free flow in the downstream is larger than the critical flux @xmath53 and the free flow is linearly unstable with respect to long wavelength perturbations of infinitesimal amplitude .",
    "the growth of infinitesimal perturbations leads to spontaneously formed clusters and as pointed out in ref.@xcite , complex sequences of traffic jams may appear in the downstream region . in a certain range of @xmath1 , we also observe that clusters form a periodic regular sequence .",
    "it turns out that this regular sequence is caused by the presence of the on - ramp , whose detailed discussion will be given in the next subsection .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase](b ) , we present the phase diagram for @xmath56 vehicles / h",
    ". the free flow can exist until @xmath1 reaches @xmath49 , as in the previous subsection .",
    "when @xmath1 is smaller than 92 vehicles / h , the free flow ( with a transition layer ) is the only stable phase .    for @xmath57 vehicles / h , we find another time - independent state beside the free flow , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : slc](a ) . in our simulation",
    ", this new state can be generated from the free flow by applying the triggering pulse in @xmath1 for a short time .",
    "far away from the on - ramp , the density and flow are homogeneous both in the upstream and downstream . near the on - ramp",
    ", a localized cluster appears , which does not propagate in either direction but stays motionless . due to this immobility",
    ", such state is named as the  standing localized cluster \" ( slc ) state in ref.@xcite .",
    "the immobility of the slc state is in contrast to the situations without ramps where all inhomogeneities should propagate .",
    "hence the property is due to a novel effect of the on - ramp .",
    "another interesting property of the slc state becomes manifest in the density - flow relations .",
    "notice that the density - flow relations [ circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : slc](b ) ] measured at several locations near the on - ramp do not necessarily fall on the homogeneous density - flow relation curve ( @xmath58 ) [ solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : slc](b ) ] even though the relation at each measurement location remains stationary with time .",
    "more remarkably , the circles lie in the linearly unstable density region .",
    "incidentally , an experimental data which may be relevant to this has been reported @xcite .",
    "it was observed that when the traffic is in the stationary synchronized flow state , the density and flux can remain stationary during a relatively long time interval ( 2 - 5 min ) .",
    "their stationary values often lie in the linearly unstable density region and they form a two - dimensional area in the density - flow plane instead of falling on a single well - defined density - flow relation curve . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the stationary values are interpreted as an indication of the spatially _ homogeneous _ traffic , and helbing , hennecke , and treiber @xcite proposed the hct state as an origin of the stationary synchronized flow .",
    "the hct state provides an explanation for the stability of the traffic in the linearly unstable density region but it leads to the formation of the well - defined density - flow relation curve , failing to explain the absence of such a curve in the measurement .    present analysis of the slc state raises an alternative possibility .",
    "the slc state shows that being stationary does not necessarily imply the homogeneity , and it also explains the stability in the linearly unstable density region .",
    "furthermore it can explain the absence of the well - defined density - flow relation curve .",
    "we mention that upon the adiabatic variations of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and the external flux profile @xmath59 , the density - flow relation at a single measurement location can cover a two - dimensional area in the density - flow plane .",
    "these agreements raises an interesting possibility of an alternative explanation for the stationary synchronized traffic flow based on the slc state .",
    "we judge however that it is yet premature to draw a definite conclusion from these agreements alone .",
    "further experimental investigation of the stationary synchronized traffic flow is necessary . in the next section ,",
    "we demonstrate analytically that the traffic equations ( [ eq : eqofmotion1],[eq : eqofmotion2 ] ) do have the slc state solution .",
    "as the on - ramp flux @xmath1 increases adiabatically , one finds the phase transition from the slc state to the recurring hump ( rh ) state [ fig .",
    "[ fig : rh](a ) ] . in the rh state , a cluster , or a hump ,",
    "does not remain stationary but moves back and forth in a localized region near the on - ramp .",
    "its drift to far upstream is not allowed since the upstream vehicle density is lower than the boundary value @xmath5 .",
    "the rh state is investigated in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite using the periodic boundary condition , and many interesting properties are found such as the discontinuous transition from the free flow to the rh state induced by localized perturbations of finite amplitudes , hysteresis , gradual spatial transitions from the rh state to the free flow , and synchronized oscillations .",
    "these properties are identical to those of the synchronized flow ( nonstationary type ) @xcite , and based on these common properties , the rh state is proposed as the origin of the synchronized flow .",
    "in addition to the properties of the rh state discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we investigate here the transition between the rh state and the slc state .",
    "our simulation shows that the transition from the slc state to the rh state and the reverse transition occur at the same critical value of @xmath1 without hysteresis .",
    "we also examine the oscillation amplitude of the rh state .",
    "the amplitude decreases to zero continuously as @xmath1 approaches the critical value [ fig .",
    "[ fig : rh](b ) ] .",
    "below the critical value , the hump does not oscillate and it becomes a standing cluster .",
    "these properties suggest that these transitions are a result of the supercritical ( or very weak subcritical ) hopf bifurcation @xcite of the slc state to the rh state",
    ".    these transitions between the slc state and the rh state are not observed in the previous study @xcite , where the adiabatic decrease of the ramp flux leads to the discontinuous transition of the rh state to the free flow instead ( fig .  3 in ref .",
    "we attribute this difference to the different boundary condition adopted in this paper .",
    "unlike the open boundary condition where @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be controlled independently , the periodic boundary condition used in @xcite is such that the increase ( decrease ) of @xmath1 is always accompanied by the decrease ( increase ) of @xmath0 since the average density of the total system is fixed .",
    "therefore the  scanning \" direction in ref.@xcite is different from that in this paper .",
    "we next discuss the traffic jam state .",
    "in homogeneous highways without ramps , the formation and propagation of the jam can not occur when the flux is smaller than @xmath45 . in the present case with an on - ramp , the flux @xmath0 in the upstream region",
    "is lower than @xmath45 while the flux in the downstream region can be controlled by @xmath1 .",
    "thus a usual jam that consists of a single localized cluster should decay after they reach the upstream region .",
    "so in this sense , a usual traffic jam is not a steady state .",
    "our investigations show that a different type of traffic jams ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oct ] ) can occur even when @xmath55 due to the nontrivial effect of the on - ramp : clusters are self - generated near the on - ramp repeatedly , forming a `` train '' of clusters moving upstream .",
    "although each constituting cluster decays during its upstream propagation , the train can still remain stable provided that the decay rate is smaller than the self - generation rate , which is controlled by the extent of the inhomogeneity , @xmath1 , rather than by the upstream or downstream flux .",
    "thus the stability limits of the new traffic jam do not coincide with those of the usual traffic jams [ fig .",
    "[ fig : phase](b ) ] . notice that this train structure is different from usual traffic jams in homogeneous highways . to indicate the structural difference , we will call this state the  oscillating congested traffic \" ( oct ) state .",
    "we note that a traffic jam state very similar to the oct state appears for @xmath60 .",
    "clusters are self - generated near the on - ramp repeatedly , forming a regular sequence of clusters .",
    "for @xmath61 , however , each cluster does not decay in their upstream movement because of the high upstream density .",
    "the structure of the oct state can be compared to the rh state . in both states ,",
    "clusters appear recurrently near the on - ramp . in the oct state",
    ", however , the area of the congested region expands with time , while in the rh state , clusters are localized .",
    "this difference is due to the larger size of clusters in the former .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the structure of the oct state shows an interesting crossover as @xmath1 varies . for small values of @xmath1 ( close to the lower stability limit ) , the distance between the clusters is relatively large so that there exist homogeneous flow regions in between [ fig .",
    "[ fig : oct](a ) ] . as @xmath1 increases",
    ", the distance between the clusters shrinks and for sufficiently large values of @xmath1 , the homogeneous regions between them disappear [ fig .  [",
    "fig : oct](b ) ] , and the clusters are  closely packed \" inside the congested region .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , these structural differences are discovered using a different hydrodynamic model and the oct states for small and large @xmath1 are identified as two distinct phases .",
    "the former was called the `` triggered stop and go '' ( tsg ) flow and the latter oct . in this paper , however , we find that these apparently different states transform smoothly to each other as @xmath1 is varied , without any signature of singularities .",
    "thus we group these two states as a single dynamic phase in this paper .",
    "this difference between this paper and ref .",
    "@xcite may be due to the different models used , but presently we do not know the precise origin of the difference .",
    "we emphasize that in a certain range of @xmath1 , three phases , the free flow , the rh state , and the traffic jam ( oct ) can coexist . in this metastable region of @xmath1 ,",
    "small differences in the initial traffic condition may result in quite different final states .",
    "we mention that in a recent measurement @xcite , very similar initial states of the free flow are observed to undergo different phase transitions either to the synchronized flow or to the traffic jam . here",
    "we obtain the three phases from the traffic equations with a fixed parameter set .",
    "the difference between the three phases , the free flow , the rh state , and the traffic jam ( oct ) , is manifest in the travel time distributions which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : travel time ] . in order to calculate the exact travel time distributions , we determine the trajectory of a vehicle , which is initially located at @xmath62 , as follows : @xmath63 from the trajectory of each vehicle , we obtain the vehicle travel time passing through the region from @xmath64 km to @xmath65 km . with the same @xmath56 vehicles / h and @xmath66 vehicles / h ,",
    "the travel time distributions of the three states show different behaviors .",
    "while it consists of a single peak for the free flow , those for the rh state and the traffic jam ( oct ) show broad distributions due to the nonstationary nature of these phases .",
    "also notice that in average , the travel time for the traffic jam ( oct ) is greater than those for the free flow and the rh state .",
    "[ fig : phase](c ) shows the phase diagram for @xmath68 vehicles / h ( about 25% lower than @xmath69 vehicles / h ) . the free flow remains linearly stable for @xmath70 . in a narrow range of @xmath1 ,",
    "480 vehicles / h@xmath71",
    "492 vehicles / h , the slc state is found , and for @xmath72 vehicles / h , the oct state is found .",
    "for this low upstream flux , however , the rh state does not appear .",
    "we find the critical value of @xmath0 below the rh state is absent is about 1872 vehicles / h .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the upper stability limit of the slc state and the lower stability limit of the oct state coincide within our numerical accuracy .",
    "we verified that upon the adiabatic increase of @xmath1 , the slc state undergoes the phase transition to the oct state , and upon the adiabatic decrease of @xmath1 , the reverse phase transition occurs , both at @xmath73 vehicles / h . this coincidence raises an interesting possibility of a close relation between the two phases .",
    "this possibility is also supported by the expansion rate of the congested region , which seems to approach zero smoothly as @xmath1 is reduced to the lower stability limit of the oct state .",
    "we next examine the evolution of the traffic jam state .",
    "[ fig : octstructure ] shows the evolution of the structure of the congested region as @xmath1 is increased .",
    "for relatively small @xmath1 , the structure is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : oct ] .",
    "as @xmath1 increases , however , a homogeneous flow region appears near the on - ramp , which expands with time [ fig .  [ fig : octstructure](a ) ] .",
    "hence the congested region is partitioned into an inhomogeneous part and a homogeneous one . for an even higher value of @xmath1 ( = 730 vehicles / h ) , the inhomogeneous",
    "part shrinks in length with time and after this transient process , the whole congested region consists of a homogeneous part [ fig .",
    "[ fig : octstructure](b ) ] . in ref.@xcite",
    ", this state of traffic flow is named the  homogeneous congested traffic \" ( hct ) state and is identified as a distinct phase .",
    "unlike ref .",
    "@xcite , however , it is not so clear in our simulations whether the oct and hct states are distinct phases .",
    "the distinction between the oct and the hct state is obscured further in our simulations by the presence of an intermediate traffic state where both the oct - like inhomogeneous part and the hct - like homogeneous part expand with time .",
    "we call this intermediate state the  mixed congested traffic \" ( mct ) state [ fig .",
    "[ fig : octstructure](a ) ] . as @xmath1 increases",
    ", the change from the oct state to the mct state and then to the hct state seems to occur in a smooth way .",
    "we thus infer that the oct , mct , and hct are different forms of a single jam phase .",
    "we now focus on the hct state . notice that even though @xmath74 , the area of the congested traffic increases monotonically with the group velocity of the upstream front about @xmath75 km / h , which is considerably lower than the usual jam propagation velocity @xmath7615 km / h @xcite .",
    "this monotonic widening of the congested region is caused by the `` blockage '' effect of the ramp , which can be understood easily by recalling that in real highways , a large flux from the on - ramp can almost block the flow of vehicles on main highways .",
    "we also mention that the structure of the hct state is identical to the traffic jam ( shock ) caused by a blockage @xcite , which implies that for large @xmath1 , the ramp works as a bottleneck .",
    "interestingly , the density in the congested region lies in the linearly unstable region of the homogeneous flow , @xmath77 . hence according to refs .",
    "@xcite , long wavelength fluctuations of even infinitesimal amplitude should grow in this region . in our simulations",
    ", we find that small inhomogeneities in the initial state indeed grow to form clusters .",
    "these clusters however disappear when they reach the upstream boundary of the congested region and the congested region becomes homogeneous afterwards .",
    "this result implies that inside the linearly unstable region , there exists a range of density where the homogeneous flow is _ convectively _ stable @xcite ( that is , the instability drifts away in one particular direction leaving the regions behind unaffected ) . the same observation is made in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the hct state is related to the stationary synchronized flow . as mentioned in the preceding subsection",
    ", however , the density - flow relation in congested region of the hct state lies on the single curve @xmath78 , which differs from the experimental observations of scattered data @xcite .",
    "we mention that the hct state may be very sensitive to the presence of noises since it is only convectively stable .",
    "it is instructive to compare the stability ranges in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase](c ) with those in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase](b ) .",
    "the stability range of the slc state lies entirely below @xmath79 in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase](c ) while it is mostly above @xmath79 in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase](b ) .",
    "also the stability range of the oct reaches below @xmath79 in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase](c ) while it lies entirely above @xmath79 in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase](b ) .",
