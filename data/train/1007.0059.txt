[ [ estimation - of - the - tunneling - rates - under - current - experimental - conditions ] ] estimation of the tunneling rates under current experimental conditions ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      here we discuss the tunneling rates in the weakest lattice potential which is along the @xmath284 direction .",

    "these results demonstrate that for a typical interrogation time of the order of @xmath309 ms , tunneling events can be neglected , especially for the @xmath310k situation which was the temperature at which most data points were taken ( see main text ) .",

    "this experiment has been the only one capable of observing super - exchange interactions at energy scales as low as 5 hz .",
    "nevertheless , regardless of the high degree of experimental control and precision , the experimental data was not able to observe any deviation of the single - particle tunneling due to interactions compatible with the uncertainties of the lattice depths .",
    "furthermore , recent theoretical efforts have predicted that only close to a feshbach resonance , interaction assisted tunneling terms can start to play a role , see ref@xcite .",
    "this happens when the mean interaction energy of the gas becomes larger than the vibrational energy spacing .        in the experiment described above ,",
    "the density shift was determined by measuring a differential shift of the sr clock transition as the number of atoms loaded into the 2d lattice was varied .",
    "the sample density was alternated between a high and a low value every two cycles of the experiment , as two interrogations of the clock transition were required to obtain one estimate of the transition center frequency .",
    "the sequential frequency data points are indexed by @xmath314 , which runs from @xmath315 to @xmath316 , where @xmath317 is the total number of frequency points in a data run .",
    "the correlation between the clock transition frequency and the sample density was determined by analyzing consecutive groups (  strings \" ) of frequency data , of length @xmath27 .",
    "if for all odd @xmath314 the density was at the low value , and for all even @xmath314 the density was high , the correlated frequency shift is @xmath318 we then perform the same string analysis on the associated sample densities and normalize each string point to obtain the collisional frequency shift per unit density .",
    "a similar analysis was introduced in @xcite , and this method is equivalent to removing a polynomial of order @xmath319 from each @xmath27-point sequence of data . for a string of length @xmath320 , this simply corresponds to isolating the differential shift between the high and low density data , while for a string of length @xmath321 , a linear drift is removed .",
    "as mentioned in the main text , we used strings of length @xmath322 to analyze our data , thereby eliminating sensitivity to both linear and quadratic drifts .",
    "this drift removal is necessary because of the residual drift in the ultrastable fabry - perot cavity that served as our frequency reference .    for each data run , we report the mean and standard error of the string points . as the data strings overlap with one another",
    ", they are not completely independent , and a correction factor @xmath323 must be applied to the standard error of the string points .",
    "stated in other words , without this factor there are  too many points \" and dividing the standard deviation of the data set by the square root of the number of measurements will underestimate the error .    a single data run consisted of a period of continuous lock to the clock transition , and",
    "therefore there was a significant variation in the lengths of individual runs .",
    "this variation in run length is partly responsible for the variation in the errors of the data runs .",
    "we applied a cut at the start of each data run to allow sufficient time for the clock laser servo to acquire a stable lock to the atomic transition .",
    "all data runs corresponding to a given set of of experimental conditions were combined to give an estimate of value and the uncertainty of the frequency shift ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] in the main text ) .",
    "the shift value was obtained by taking the error - weighted mean of all the data runs , and the uncertainty was estimated from the variance of the weighted mean .",
    "we calculated a @xmath324 per degree of freedom , or a reduced @xmath324 ( @xmath325 ) for each set of data runs , and scaled the final uncertainty by @xmath326 .",

    "the error bars for each bin are determined from the standard error of the bin and scaled by the correction factor .",
    "this data is then used to calculate the weighted mean and error of the weighted mean for the entire data record .",
    "a reduced chi - square statistic was also calculated and the bin size is adjusted to achieve a reduced chi - square of @xmath329 for each data record .",
    "this method has the advantage that it weights data according to actual scatter of the measurement points so that data with greater signal to noise is weighted more heavily . with this method ,",
    "we are also able to consistently compare our longer data records to data records where the data was acquired over very few continuous locks to atoms and even fewer days ( making the two following protocols inappropriate ) . in an effort to present all of our data using a consistent method of analysis , all data point in fig .",

    "simple means of each data run were used to determine the central value of the shift for that run . the weighted mean and",
    "the error of the weighted mean were determined from these data , and a reduced chi - square statistic was calculated .",
    "we then scale the error by the square - root of the chi - square value . for this method",

    "similar to the previous method , but data runs are taken to be periods of continuous lock to the atoms rather than days of data taking .",

    "we used several techniques to characterize important experimental parameters such as the sample temperature along the strongly- and weakly - confined directions in the 2d lattice , the lamb - dicke parameter , and the trapping frequencies .",
    "the temperature along the weakly - confined direction ( @xmath19 ) was established by fitting the width of the doppler broadened spectroscopic feature obtained when the clock laser propagated along @xmath19 .",
    "temperatures along the strongly - confined directions were determined via sideband spectroscopy , as described in @xcite and the main text .",
    "the trap frequencies along @xmath17 and @xmath18 both vary as the horizontal lattice power is varied .",
    "this occurs because the two lattice beams are not orthogonal but instead cross at an angle of @xmath341 .",
    "the eigenaxes of the resulting 2d harmonic potential therefore are a function of the power in both of the two lattice beams .",
    "this effect was properly taken into account when the trap confinement and transverse lamb - dicke parameter were determined ."

    "<S> this advance removes an important obstacle to further increasing the precision and accuracy of neutral atom - based optical clocks . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the number of atoms loaded into our 2d lattice system will enable us to improve the stability of our clock without imposing an onerous systematic effect . </S>",
    "<S> as clock lasers become more stable , we will be able to increase the duration of the rabi interrogation pulse , thus decreasing the rabi frequency . </S>",
    "<S> this will allow optical lattice clocks to operate in the regime where the density shift is fully suppressed ( @xmath178 ) and further reduce the collisional shift systematic well into the 10@xmath179 domain . </S>",
    "<S> this , together with the fact that in the strongly - interacting regime the collisional shift will remain suppressed as more atoms are loaded into individual lattice sites , will enable neutral atom clocks to operate with the large sample sizes needed to achieve the highest possible stability .    </S>",
