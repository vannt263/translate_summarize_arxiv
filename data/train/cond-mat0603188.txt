    "having studied the qubit dynamics , we next focus on the modification of the oscillator state .",

    "figure  [ fig : updown ] reveals that the latter states survive for long times , while of the former states only @xmath70 stays occupied , as it follows from the relation that @xmath83 , derived above .",
    "thus , the final state exhibits a peculiar type of entanglement between the qubit and the oscillator , and can be written as @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "this implies that only odd - photon states are occupied if the qubit ends in @xmath19 , representing a highly nonclassical oscillator state .",
    "qubit and oscillator end up fully entangled , in the sense that after tracing out the oscillator states , no coherence between the qubit states @xmath18 and @xmath19 is left .    while @xmath86 is determined by the ratio @xmath87",
    ", the coefficients @xmath88 depend also on the oscillator frequency .",
    "experiments in circuit qed have been performed for @xmath89 in the coherent regime @xcite .",
    "there , @xmath90 to a very good approximation .",
    "hence one can control via @xmath91 the final state to be any superposition of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "in particular , in the adiabatic limit @xmath92 , the final state becomes @xmath71 .",
    "this has the important physical implication of the creation of exactly one photon in the cavity , triggered by a landau - zener transition . in an experiment ,",
    "the photon will subsequently leak out of the cavity . by exploiting these two processes , we propose the following four - step lz cycle for single - photon generation : the first step is single - photon generation in the cavity via the adiabatic lz transition @xmath93 , brought about by switching the josephson energy sufficiently slowly .",
    "second , the photon is released from the cavity via the ( controlled ) cavity decay @xmath94 . in the third step ,",
    "another individual photon is generated via the reverse lz sweep latexmath:[$|{\\downarrow},0\\rangle \\rightarrow    completes the cycle .",
    "this scheme for repeated photon generation via landau - zener cycles makes use of two advantageous properties of circuit qed : first , the artificial atom is fixed at an antinode of the cavity , so that the atom - cavity coupling remains at a constant and high value .",
    "second , qubits are highly tunable so that lz sweeps can be made from minus to plus an `` atomic '' frequency , and back .",
    "the outlined scheme presents an alternative to the proposals for single - photon generation put forward in refs .",
    "the main advantage of the present scheme is its robustness against parameter variations when operating in the regime @xmath89 .",
    "in practice , the cavity frequency @xmath67 and the qubit - oscillator coupling @xmath31 are determined by the design of the setup , while the josephson energy can be switched at a controllable velocity @xmath91  ideally from @xmath96 to @xmath97 . in reality , however , @xmath98 is bounded by @xmath99 which is determined by the critical current . the condition @xmath100 is required so that the qubit comes into resonance with the oscillator sometime during the sweep . moreover",
    ", inverting the flux through the superconducting loop requires a finite time @xmath101 , so that @xmath91 can not exceed @xmath102 . in order to study under",

    "the first three curves in fig .  [ fig : p_single ] correspond to the experimentally relevant regime where @xmath105 . here",
    "the essential dynamics is a lz transition from @xmath70 to @xmath71 around the time @xmath78 . especially for the smallest coupling constants shown , the probability for single - photon generation practically equals @xmath106 given by eq .  .",
    "thus we find that finite - time effects do not play a role as long as @xmath107 .",
    "our predicted transition probabilities based on analytical results for infinite propagation time are therefore useful to describe the finite - time lz sweeps .",
    "figure  [ fig : p_single ] also illustrates that the probability for single - photon production is highest in the adiabatic regime @xmath108 . here",
    "the typical duration of a lz transition is @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "so in the regime of interest , the sought condition for a `` practically infinite time interval '' is @xmath110 . for the unrealistically large qubit - oscillator coupling @xmath111 ,",
    "reliable single - photon generation is less probable .",
    "this is so because ( i ) the lz transition is incomplete within @xmath104 $ ] ; ( ii ) more than two oscillator levels take part in the dynamics and more than one photon can be generated , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : updown ] ; and ( iii ) the approximation of the instantaneous ground state at @xmath112 by @xmath113 is less accurate .    for the setup of refs .",

    "the sign of the initial josephson energy @xmath115 can be inverted within @xmath116 so that @xmath117 . for the qubit - oscillator coupling strength",
    "we assume @xmath118 .",
    "notice that @xmath119 , so that generation of more than one photon is negligible .",
    "then , by choosing @xmath120 , one finds @xmath121 and a superposition with equal weights for which @xmath122 is obtained . by choosing @xmath123 instead",
    ", a nonadiabatic transition occurs with the probability @xmath124 , while the remaining probability again corresponds to single - photon generation . as another extreme case , for the much slower sweep velocity @xmath125 ,",
    "one is in the adiabatic limit in which a single photon is created with a probability of @xmath126 .",
    "thus for the final state , one can obtain any desired superposition of the states @xmath70 and @xmath71 by choosing a proper value of @xmath91 .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the coupling of a qubit to a circuit cavity mode induces landau - zener transitions upon variation of the penetrating flux .",
    "for an oscillator initially in its ground state , we derived an exact closed expression for the transition probability which possesses an appealing form : it only depends on the interaction strength between the qubit and the oscillator and , in particular , it is independent of the actual oscillator frequency @xmath67 . thus , the lz dynamics can be manipulated via the velocity at which the qubit levels cross . for a circuit qed setup , we found that both nonadiabatic and adiabatic sweeps are feasible and can be exploited for quantum state preparation .",
