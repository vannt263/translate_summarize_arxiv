    "from 1998 to date several important discoveries in the astrophysical sciences have being made , which have given rise to the so called new cosmology @xcite . amongst its more important facts we may cite :    - flat , critical density accelerating universe    - early period of rapid expansion ( inflation )    - density inhomogeneities produced from quantum fluctuations during inflation    - composition : 2/3 dark energy ; 1/3 dark matter ; 1/200 brigh stars    - matter content : @xmath1 nonbarionic dark matter ; @xmath2 baryons",
    ", @xmath3 neutrinos    - @xmath4    - @xmath5    - @xmath6    it is a fact that the standard lcdm model , though rather simple from the theoretical point of view , can accomodate most of today s astrophysical data .",
    "however , it still has several open questions ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , one of them being : could other ( yet unknown ) models fit the data equally well ?",
    "alternative models should obviously consider the main components of the universe .",
    "there is much concern about unveiling the dark part of our universe , which implies that we do nt lack candidates .",
    "so , for dark matter we have neutrinos , axions , neutralinos ; for dark energy : the cosmological constant , scalar fields ( for example , quintessence ) , cosmic field defects , etc . so far ,",
    "most models of dark energy have a rather phenomenological character , though a few proposals concerning the possible role of the dark energy field in the context of fundamental physics have appeared @xcite .",
    "the recent dark energy scalar field research has several interesting features ( see @xcite for an extense review ) .",
    "many models have attractor or tracker behaviour , allowing , for a wide range of initial conditions , a subdominant field energy density at high redshifts ( radiation and matter dominated eras ) .    in the simplest versions , scalar fields models of dark energy",
    "have a scalar field kinetic term , and the scalar field is coupled only to itself and gravity .",
    "so , the scalar field part of the model is fully characterized by the scalar field potential , with some broad constraints on the initial conditions for the field , if the attractor behaviour is realized .",
    "many different potentials have being used ( see reviews @xcite ) :    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this talk i want to call the attention to exponential potentials , which have being often discarded on fine tunig arguments or ( the simplest exponential ) because they can not produce the wanted transition from subdominant to dominant energy density ( @xcite ) . however , as shown in @xcite , they have proved useful in describing several features in the history of the universe , from radiation decoupling to nowadays .",
    "also , several authors have recently pointed out that the degree of fine tuning needed in these scenarios is no more than in others usually accepted @xcite .",
    "especially interesting results are obtained if we model dark energy using both a scalar field and a cosmological constant .",
    "the cosmological constant can be incorporated into the quintessence potential as a constant which shifts the potential value , especially , the value of the minimum of the potential , where the quintessence field rolls towards .",
    "conversely , the height of the minimum of the potential can also be regarded as a part of the cosmological constant .",
    "usually , for separating them , the possible nonzero height of the minimum of the potential is incorporated into the cosmological constant and then set to be zero .",
    "the cosmological constant can be provided by various kinds of matter , such as the vacuum energy of quantum fields and the potential energy of classical fields and may also be originated in the intrinsic geometry .",
    "so far there is no sufficient reason to set the cosmological constant ( or the height of the minimum of the quintessence potential ) to be zero , especially when the ultimate fate of our universe is more sensitive to the presence of the cosmological constant ( or the nonzero height of the minimum of the quintessence potential ) than any other matter content , even though the cosmological constant may be extremely tiny and undetectable at all in present time ( @xcite . in particular , some mechanisms to generate a negative cosmological constant have been pointed out , in the context of spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "we consider a model consisting of a three - component cosmological fluid : matter , scalar field ( quintessence with an exponential potential ) and a negative cosmological constant .",
    "we point out that we model dark energy with both the quintessence field and the negative cosmological constant , resulting possitive our effective cosmological constant , in agreement with experimetal data @xcite .",
    " matter  means barionic + cold dark matter , with no pressure , and the scalar field is minimally coupled and noninteracting with matter , so the action is :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the cosmological constant , @xmath9 is the lagrangian for the matter degrees of freedom and the lagrangian for the quintessense field is given by    @xmath10    this model can not be used from the very beginning of the universe , but only since decoupling of radiation and dust .",
    "thus , we do nt take into account inflation , creation of matter , nucleosynthesis , etc .",
    "we apply the same technique of adimensional variables we used in @xcite ( this allows to determine the integration constants without additional assumptions ) .",
    "we use the dimensionless time variable @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the cosmological time and @xmath13 is the present value of the hubble parameter . in this case",
    "@xmath14 is the scale factor .",
    "then we have that , at present @xmath15    @xmath16    considering a homogeneous and isotropic universe , and using the experimental fact of a spatially flat universe @xcite , the field equations derivable from ( 2.1 ) are    @xmath17    @xmath18    and    @xmath19    where the dot means derivative in respet to @xmath20 and ,    @xmath21    @xmath22    with @xmath23 - the present density of matter , @xmath24 and @xmath25 - a generic constant .",
    "applying the noether symmetry aproach @xcite , it can be shown that the new variables we should introduce to simplify the field equations are the same used in @xcite :    @xmath26    and    @xmath27    in these variables the field eqs .",
    "( 2.4 - 2.6 ) may be written as the following pair of equations    @xmath28    and    @xmath29    where :    @xmath30    combining of eqs .",
    "( 2.11 ) and ( 2.12)yields    @xmath31    and    @xmath32    the solutions of the equations ( 2.14 ) and ( 2.15 ) are found to be    @xmath33    and    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the integration constants .    in finding the integration constants we use the equations ( 2.3 ) and field equations evaluated at @xmath37 . finally ,",
    "using @xmath38 and the ansatz    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is a positive real number , then the above integration constants can be written in the following way :    @xmath41    @xmath42    @xmath43}^{(\\pm)}=\\frac{\\{\\sqrt{3}-[\\pm]\\sqrt{1+q_0 - 1.5\\omega{m_0}}\\}}{% \\sqrt{-3\\;\\omega_\\lambda}}u_2^{(\\pm)},\\ ] ]    and    @xmath44}^{(\\pm)}=\\frac{2-\\sqrt{-\\omega_\\lambda}\\;v_2^{(\\pm)}u_{1\\;[% \\pm]}^{(\\pm)}}{\\sqrt{-\\omega_\\lambda}\\;u_2^{(\\pm)}},\\ ] ]    respectively .",
    "effective quintessence potential @xmath45 from field equations ( 2.4 ) or ( 2.5 ) and equations ( 2.7 ) and ( 2.13 ) can be written @xmath46 so the ansatz ( 2.18 ) establishes an interesting relationship between the value @xmath47 of the exponential potential @xmath48 and the value @xmath49 towards which @xmath45 asymptotes .",
    "other ansatze could have been taken , however , this one notably simplifies equations ( for instance , eq.(2.17 ) ) .",
    "also , as we will see later , many of the cosmological parameters result independent of @xmath40 , avoiding fine tuning respect to this parameter .",
    "since @xmath50 should be real ( see equation ( 2.21 ) ) then , the following constrain on the present value of the deceleration parameter follows        after making a detailed study , it was determined that the only relevant cosmological magnitude that has a sensible dependence on parameter @xmath40 is the state parameter @xmath55 .",
    "we used @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "figure 1 shows the evolution of the scale factor for @xmath58 . it can be shown both algebraically and graphically that the evolution of the universe is independent of @xmath40 , but not writen for the sake of simplicity .",
    "this results favour the formulation of both quantum field and string theories .",
    "a breakdown of perturbative quantum field theory in spacetimes with accelerated expansion is known to occur @xcite.on the other hand , an eternally accelerating universe seems to be at odds with string theory , because of the impossibility of formulating the s - matrix . in a desitter space",
    "the presence of an event horizon , signifying causally disconnected regions of space , implies the absence of asymptotic particle states which are needed to define transition amplitudes .",
    "it is also interesting that sen and sethi , using an ansatz for the scale factor that produces future deceleration , obtain from field equations that the quintessence potential should be a double exponential plus a constant @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows the behaviour of the deceleration parameter as function of the redshift z for the same values of the parameters .",
    "this figure shows an early stage of deceleration and a current epoch of acceleration . a transition from an accelerated phase to a decelerated one",
    "is seen approximately for z = 0.5 .",
    "we appreciate an increase of the deceleration parameter upon increasing the value of z. this points at a past epoch in the evolution when gravity of the dark energy was attractive . as follows from figure 1 , aceleration is not eternal : in the future @xmath59 again , which gives rise to the collapse .",
    "figure 3 shows the evolution of the state parameter of the effective quintessence field @xmath60 .",
    "it s noticeable that the effective quintessence field has state parameter @xmath61 near @xmath62 today , which means that its behaviour is similar to the  pure  cosmological constant , as a vacuum fluid . if we are to explain the very desirable for today s cosmology recent and future deceleration obtained in our model , it s important to look at the dynamical quintessence field .",
    "we see that in the recent past @xmath63 , which implies that quintessence field behaved ( or simply was ) like ordinary atractive matter , giving rise to the logical deceleration . in the future",
    "this will happen again ( @xmath64 , with the consequent deceleration .",
    "now we proceed to analyze how our solution reproduces some experimental results . with this purpose , in fig .",
    "4 we plot the distance modulus @xmath65 vs redshift z , calculated by us and the one obtained with the usual model with a constant @xmath66 term .",
    "the relative deviations are of about 0.5@xmath67 .",
