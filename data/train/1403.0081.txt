    "all cosmological data from different sources testify to the fact that our world is made of a substance of negative pressure @xmath3 ( dark energy ( de ) ) , missing mass @xmath4 ( dark matter ( dm ) ) and only @xmath5 conductive material ( baryon matter ) @xcite .",
    "dm and de can have interaction and the interaction of these is not known in the physics .",

    "several models have been proposed to explain the universe s accelerated expansion @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the models can be divided into two general groups : the first group of models that are needed to correct the einstein theory of gravity with a new geometric terms is known as geometric models .",
    "the first of these models is @xmath7 which is obtained by replacing the @xmath8 ricci curvature with arbitrary @xmath7 function@xcite .",
    "the second group of models that are expansion is attributed to exotic fluids with negative pressure .",
    "it is believed that exotic fluid is a mimic dark energy equation of state in the present era ( for a modern review see @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "both of these models have different applications and important results of these models are derived as alternative cosmological models @xcite .",
    "several properties of de have been studied in numerous papers@xcite .",
    "de can be decay @xcite or reconstruct from different theoretical models @xcite .",
    "there is no simple and unique model that can have to describe this exotic energy .",
    "models in which the scalar - tensor fields used are able to solve such complex issues by simple mathematics to the extend possible @xcite .",
    "so there are very attractive models to study .",
    "a scalar - tensor model is proposed among all the different cosmological models .",
    "the model is able to explain the dm and dynamic clusters of galaxies with an additional vector field and relying only baryonic matter @xcite .",
    "this model is known as stvg or mog .",
    "mog can be seen as a covariant theory with vector - tensor - scalar fields for gravity with the following action : @xmath9\\sqrt{-g}d^4x.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first term of the action is einstein - hilbert lagrangian .",
    "the second term is the conventional scalar field and the last term contains a @xmath10 kinetic energy field that plays the role of the gravitational constant ( however , the fields can be considered similar to a time dependent gravitational constant by slowly time varying fields ) @xcite .",
    "this action classes are written in covariant forms and are used to investigate the astrophysical phenomena such as rotation curves of galaxies , mass distribution of cosmic clusters or gravitational lenses .",
    "the model might be a suitable alternative to @xmath11cdm model considered @xcite . in order to understand the role of scalar and vector fields we write the equations of motion for flrw metric : @xmath12,\\ \\ d\\omega^2=d\\theta^2+\\sin^2{\\theta}d\\phi^2\\ ] ] form of the equations can be rewritten as a generalized friedmann equations as follow @xcite : @xmath13 + \\frac{g}{8\\pi}\\lambda-\\frac{3g}{8\\pi}\\left(\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a}+h^2\\right)=0,\\\\ & & \\ddot{\\mu}+3h\\dot{\\mu}-\\frac{\\dot{\\mu}^2}{\\mu}-\\frac{\\dot{g}}{g}\\dot{\\mu}+g\\omega\\mu^3\\phi_0 ^ 2+\\frac{2}{\\mu}v_\\mu - v'_\\mu=0,\\\\ & & \\ddot{\\omega}+3h\\dot{\\omega}-\\frac{\\dot{g}}{g}\\dot{\\omega}-\\frac{1}{2}g\\mu^2\\phi_0 ^ 2+gv_\\phi+v'_\\omega=0.\\label{eq : omega}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    scalar and vector fields interaction terms of the aforementioned classes are self interaction and they are shown by an arbitrary mathematical functions : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the resulting equations of motion are highly nonlinear and there is no possibility to find analytical solutions .",
    "the only possible way to evaluate answer is numerical method . at the same time",
    ", we must also determine the shape of the interaction @xmath18 .",
    "mathematical differences may be a good solution for finding certain family of potentials . if we consider the @xmath10 scalar field with a time variable gravitational field ( g(t ) ) and ignore the contributions of the other fields in favor of the g(t ) , and also due to the cosmological data @xmath19 , time evolution of g(t ) will be the major contribution .",
    "in fact , data from the large cosmological confirm our conjecture about just keeping the @xmath20 , and kinetic part of @xmath20 can be neglected because : @xmath21 regardless , second - order derivatives of additional fields which introduced additional degrees of freedom and in the absence of additional fields on mog , with the approximation that the time evolution of the fields is very slowly varying , mog and einstein - hilbert action can be considered as the same .",
    "the difference is that now @xmath20 is a scalar time variable field .",
    "equations of motion are written in the following general form , if we consider small variation of @xmath20 and @xmath22 are functions of time @xcite : @xmath23 ( see for instance @xcite ) @xmath24\\label{feq},\\ ] ] energy - momentum function of matter fields ( ordinary or exotic ) is proposed as follows : @xmath25 cosmological models , which were introduced by the mentioned equations of motion have been investigated several times by different authors @xcite .",
    "but we approach this problem with a more general view .",
    "as we have shown , mog is the limit of weak fields able to induce and introduces a gravitational field @xmath20 .",
    "so , our paper can be considered as a cosmological analysis of mog in the weak field regime .",

    "secondly , generalization of cosmological constant is proposed as a modified ricci de model to time variable scenario has an oscillatory form in terms of h. @xmath42 note that if we think on trigonometric term as oscillatory term , the amplitudes of the oscillations are assumed to be proportional to the barotropic and de components .",
