    "with the establishment of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite as a state - of - the - art method for calculating strongly correlated electron models @xcite and materials @xcite , the scientific frontier moved on to extensions of dmft that include the important local correlations of dmft but also non - local correlations beyond .",
    "one route to this end are cluster extensions of dmft where a finite cluster of sites is surrounded by a dmft bath @xcite .",
    "more recently , diagrammatic extensions of dmft have been proposed as a vivid alternative @xcite , which have in particular the advantage that long - range and short - range correlations are treated on an equal footing and that realistic materials calculations @xcite are possible .",
    "note that the numerical effort of cluster extensions generally grows exponentially with the number of sites times the number of orbitals , which severely restricts the application of cluster extensions .",
    "several closely related diagrammatic extensions of dmft have been proposed : the dynamical vertex approximation ( d@xmath3a ) @xcite , the dual fermion ( df ) @xcite , dual boson@xcite and non - local expansion @xcite , the one - particle irreducible approach ( 1pi ) @xcite , the merger of dmft with the functional renormalization group ( dmf@xmath4rg ) @xcite , the triply- and quadruply - irreducible local expansion @xcite and dmft+fluctuation exchange ( flex ) @xcite .",
    "all these approaches start from the local , but fully frequency dependent vertex , and diagrammatically construct from this non - local correlations beyond dmft .",
    "particular highlights of the results obtained using these novel approaches are so - far : the calculation of the critical @xcite and quantum critical @xcite exponents of the hubbard model and those of the falicov kimball model @xcite , as well as establishing the insulating nature of the paramagnetic phase in the half - filled hubbard model on a square lattice at arbitrarily small interactions @xcite .",
    "the df and 1pi approach constitute a systematic expansion of the self - energy of the system in local one- , two- and more - particle local correlation ( vertex ) functions which is , in principle , exact when including _ all _ @xmath0-particle vertices in the calculation .",
    "but in practice , these approaches are truncated at the two - particle vertex level which constitutes the most fundamental approximation regarding these vertex approaches @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this truncation is that the complexity and numerical effort is already at the edge of what is possible for the @xmath5 particle vertex , for which the full dependence on three frequencies needs to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "at least this is true for the hubbard model within dmft , where arguably the most efficient way to calculate the corresponding local two - particle vertex is by means of quantum monte - carlo simulations @xcite with worm sampling @xcite and improved estimators @xcite . while individual contributions of the local three - particle vertex of the dmft hubbard or impurity model have been calculated this way @xcite , obtaining its full dependence on five frequencies exceeds presently available resources regarding both , computational time and memory .",
    "the falicov kimball model ( fkm ) @xcite on the other hand has a much simpler structure than the hubbard model .",
    "in contrast to the latter it describes noninteracting itinerant electrons which are scattered at localized ones and , hence , represent a model for ( anealed ) disorder rather than `` real '' correlations . due to this reduced structure",
    "it has a long tradition of ( semi-)analytical calculations that are not possible for the hubbard model .",
    "therefore , the fkm has been commonly utilized as a test - bed for new approaches and concepts .",
    "indeed the fkm can be solved analytically in dmft @xcite , including charge density wave ordering @xcite and transport properties @xcite .",
    "vertex corrections to the conductivity@xcite and anderson localization@xcite have been discussed ; and it has been studied in df @xcite and 1pi @xcite .",
    "the analytical calculation of the local two - particle vertex of the fkm@xcite shows a much simpler , reduced frequency structure in comparison to the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "that is , the two - particle vertex has only two contributions since no energy can be transferred to the localized electrons : ( i ) an @xmath6 ( @xmath7 : transferred bosonic frequency ) contribution where the two fermionic frequencies have to be the same @xmath8 @xcite and ( ii ) an @xmath9 contribution @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we analytically calculate the full @xmath0-particle vertex of the fkm for arbitrary @xmath0 and analyze its magnitude as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "this is a very relevant issue since the typical truncation of the self - energy in the df and 1pi theory at the two - particle vertex level relies on the `` smallness '' of higher - order vertex functions .",
    "we , hence , finally investigate the importance of such higher - order vertices exemplary in the df theory by including the @xmath10 particle vertex in the df correction to the dmft self - energy . while at half - filling this three - particle vertex vanishes it yields a sizable contribution to the nonlocal df correction of the dmft self - energy in the case of quarter filling , indicating that in a general situation some caution has to be taken when cutting the df expansion at the two - particle vertex level .",
    "the outline of our paper is the following : in section [ sec : npartvert ] , we derive the analytical formula for the @xmath0-particle connected green s and vertex functions of the fkm within dmft . to this end , we first calculate in section [ sec : calcdmftgreen ] the @xmath0-particle green s function , from which we remove all disconnected contributions ( secs .",
    "[ sec : decomp1 ] and [ sec : decomp2 ] ) . in section",
    "[ sec : propc ] we analyze how the prefactor of the @xmath0-particle vertex grows with @xmath0 and provide an analytic estimate for its asymptotic behavior . from this",
    "we deduce in sec .",
    "[ sec : ordermagnitude ] the magnitude of the contribution of such vertices in generic self - energy diagrams of df and 1pi . in section",
    "[ sec : numerical ] we then calculate some selected correction terms for the df self - energy stemming from the @xmath10 particle vertex and compare them to the corresponding more standard corrections from two - particle vertex functions only .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to a summary of our main results and an outlook .",
    "the hamiltonian of the spin - less ( one - band ) falicov kimball model reads @xmath11 where @xmath12 annihilates ( creates ) an itinerant @xmath13-electron and , correspondingly , @xmath14 annihilates ( creates ) a localized @xmath2-electron at the lattice site @xmath15 ; @xmath16 represents the hopping amplitude for a mobile electron between nearest - neighbor sites @xmath17 .",
    "the two electron species interact with each other via a purely local ( hubbard - like ) interaction parametrized by the interaction strength @xmath18 ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the chemical potentials for the itinerant and localized electrons , respectively , which determine the density of the corresponding particles . throughout the paper",
    "all energies will be measured in terms of @xmath21 representing the half band - width for the fkm on a @xmath22 square lattice ; @xmath23 is the temperature . in the following",
    "we will consider the dmft solution of model ( [ equ : defhamilt ] ) and derive analytical expressions for the corresponding local ( connected ) @xmath0-particle dmft vertex function for arbitrary @xmath0 . to this end",
    "we systematically subtract all disconnected contributions from the full @xmath0-particle green s function @xmath24 .",
    "as we will show , this is achieved by a two - step procedure where ( i ) all diagrams which can be written as a product of a one - particle green s function @xmath25 and a remainder are eliminated from @xmath24 .",
    "then we ( ii ) remove in the second step all disconnected products among purely higher - particle green s functions ( @xmath26 ) which yields -after amputating the outer legs via dividing by the corresponding one - particle green s functions @xmath25- the final result for the @xmath0-particle local dmft vertex function for the fkm .",
    "let us stress that all results and derivations presented in this section are independent of the underlying lattice type ( e.g. , square , cubic , bethe , etc . ) .",
    "the density of itinerant and localized electrons only enters through the local one - particle green s function .",
    "let us start our considerations by recalling that the ( local ) single particle green s function of the fkm in the framework of dmft is just given as @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , is a fermionic matsubara frequency and @xmath30 denotes the hybridization function of dmft .",
    "@xmath31 represents the ( non - interacting ) single - particle green s function for the itinerant @xmath13 electrons if no localized @xmath2-electron is present at the impurity site ; @xmath32 corresponds to the same ( non - interacting ) green s function but in the presence of a localized electron which , however , just increases the energy level for the itinerant one by @xmath18 . here",
    ", the weight @xmath33 corresponds to the density of localized electrons at each lattice site ( i.e. , to the probability for finding such an electron at the given site ) and @xmath34 .",
    "hence , the local dmft single - particle green s function for the itinerant electrons is given just by the weighted average of non - interacting green s functions in the presence ( absence ) of a localized electron which , hence , acts merely as a scattering potential for the itinerant particles .",
    "this non - interacting - like nature of the fkm allows for a straightforward determination of the @xmath0-particle green s functions .",
    "in fact , taking into account that in the non - interacting situation the latter is -due to wicks theorem- just a sum of all possible products of single - particle green s functions ( i.e. , considering all possible frequency permutations of in- and outgoing particles ) , we can express the general @xmath0-particle correlation function for the fkm -analogously as in the one - particle case- by a weighted average over the corresponding non - interacting quantities in the presence ( @xmath35 ) and absence ( @xmath36 ) of a localized electron .",
    "this leads to the following expression for the local dmft @xmath0-particle green s function of the fkm@xcite @xmath37 , \\label{gn}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 correspond to the ( @xmath0 ) frequencies of the incoming and @xmath39 to the ( @xmath0 ) frequencies of the outgoing particles .",

    "( [ gn ] ) corresponds to the _ full _ local dmft @xmath0-particle green s function and , hence , contains contributions from disconnected as well as from fully connected diagrams . to extract the latter -and from this the @xmath0-particle vertex- we have to remove all disconnected contributions from eq .",
    "( [ gn ] ) . at first glance ,",
    "the most direct way to achieve this seems to be simply to subtract all terms of the form @xmath44 with @xmath45 for all possible partitions @xmath46 and all possible frequency assignments for a given partition .",
    "such a procedure , however , would lead to a massive over - counting of subtraction terms as one can easily see from the following argument : consider for instance the contributions @xmath47 and @xmath48 which certainly have to be subtracted from @xmath24 .",
    "however , considering that in the first term @xmath49 includes a contribution @xmath50 and in the second term @xmath51 contains @xmath52 it becomes obvious that the expression @xmath53 appears in _ both _ subtraction terms which indeed leads to the above mentioned over - counting problem when naively removing such contributions . in the following , we will , hence , take another path trying to to avoid the above mentioned `` over - subtraction '' . to this end , let us first consider the following algebraic identities for @xmath54 , @xmath32 and @xmath31 : @xmath55 \\\\",

    "the factors @xmath72 and @xmath73 compensate for overcounting due to permutations which only exchange frequencies between the same type ( @xmath25 or @xmath74 ) of term . for the sake of a better readability of the following derivations we introduce the following ( symbolic ) shorthand notation for the terms in the sum of eq .",

    "let us now analyze to which extent the latter already corresponds to a diagrammatic separation of terms .",
    "we first introduce the concept of one - particle disconnectedness : diagrams in which a single green s function line ( with frequency @xmath78 ) is disconnected from the rest will be called one - particle disconnected ( 1pd ) ( in frequency @xmath78)@xcite .",
    "the form of eq .",
    "( [ gndecomp1 ] ) suggests that it already represents a decomposition of @xmath24 into 1pd diagrams and a remainder .",
    "in fact , the summands for @xmath79 contain a product of one - particle green s function @xmath80 and a -not yet interpreted- contribution @xmath81 .",
    "hence , we assume that the terms for @xmath82 contain _ all _ 1pd diagrams while the remainder @xmath83 is one - particle connected ( i.e. , it exhibits no 1pd contributions ) .",
    "the latter will be denoted in the following as     all diagrams where only the frequency @xmath78 is 1pd ( left ) and all the diagrams contributing to the @xmath0-particle one - particle - connected propagator @xmath84 where frequency @xmath78 is connected only to the frequency @xmath85 .",

    "we will now prove the above assumption , i.e. , that @xmath84 indeed corresponds to the sum of all one - particle connected diagrams in @xmath24 , by induction .",
    "let us start from the base case @xmath5 for which in ref .",
    "we have calculated the full vertex . since for @xmath5",
    "all disconnected diagrams are 1pd , @xmath87 is the same as the vertex with externals legs ( green s function lines ) and reads [ eq . ( 6 ) of ] : @xmath88 with @xmath89 defined via the equation @xmath90 the frequency arguments of the expression @xmath91 have been omitted for brevity in both cases .",
    "obviously , eq .",
    "( [ t2 ] ) demonstrates that our induction hypothesis , i.e. , that @xmath84 corresponds to a sum of all one - particle connected diagrams , is correct for @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , from eqs .",
    "( [ gndecomp1 ] ) and ( [ claimt ] ) we have that @xmath92 since , by the induction hypothesis , @xmath93 contains _ all _ one - particle connected diagrams the term which is subtracted on the r.h.s .",
    "( [ gndecomp1a ] ) indeed is identical to the sum of _ all _ 1pd diagrams in @xmath94 .",
    "consequently our induction step shows that @xmath95 does _ not _ contain any 1pd diagram .",
    "instead it includes all one - particle connected diagrams of @xmath94 which completes our inductive proof .",
    "before we proceed with our decomposition procedure by removing the remaining disconnected contributions of @xmath24 , let us point out some properties of the one - particle - connected @xmath0-particle propagator .",
    "* for @xmath5 and @xmath10 , @xmath84 already represents the fully connected contribution to @xmath24 as in these cases all disconnected diagrams are 1pd . * for odd @xmath66 and half - filling ( @xmath96 ) , @xmath97 and hence @xmath98 this also implies that the fully connected propagator and by extension the vertex have to vanish as will be discussed in the next section .",
    "while the term @xmath84 derived in the previous section [ see eq .",
    "( [ claimt ] ) ] contains no 1pd diagrams , this does not automatically mean that it already corresponds to the fully connected part of the @xmath0-particle green s function ( as it is indeed the case for @xmath5 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "for instance , @xmath99 contains -apart from 1pd parts- a disconnected ( but not 1pd ) contribution proportional to @xmath100 which is a product of one - particle connected diagrams and , hence , still included in @xmath101 .",
    "hence , in order to obtain the fully connected part of @xmath24 , which we will denote as @xmath102 in the following , we have to remove such contributions",
    ". we will do this in the following in two steps : ( i ) we will derive the general functional form for @xmath102 leaving the appropriate prefactor still undefined .",
    "( ii ) the prefactor will be then determined in the second step by an explicit subtraction of all disconnected diagrams from @xmath84 .",
    "\\(i ) as for the first step we realize that for @xmath5 and @xmath10 the fully connected part of @xmath24 is proportional to @xmath87 and @xmath103 , respectively , i.e. , to @xmath104 and @xmath105 , as we have discussed above .",
    "this suggests the ansatz @xmath106 where we have again suppressed the generalized kronecker symbol @xmath40 ; @xmath107 is a -for the moment- unknown constant .",
    "we can now prove the assumption made in eq .",
    "( [ equ : ansatzconnect ] ) for the functional form of the fully connected @xmath0-particle green s function by induction .",
    "the correctness of eq .",
    "( [ equ : ansatzconnect ] ) for the base clause , i.e. , for @xmath5 , follows from eq .",
    "( [ t2 ] ) . for the induction step , we consider eq .",
    "( [ equ : ansatzconnect ] ) as induction hypothesis for all @xmath108 and infer from this , in the following , its correctness for @xmath109 .",
    "the fully connected @xmath109 particle green s function @xmath110 can be obtained from the corresponding one - particle connected one @xmath95 by removing all disconnected diagrams still present in this expression .",
    "the latter can be written ( due to the absence of 1pd contributions ) as products of fully connected @xmath111 particle green s function , i.e. , @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 . to obtain all terms that need to be subtracted one has to sum over all possible feynman diagrams of this type , i.e. , over all partitions @xmath115 of @xmath109 and -for each such partition- over all possible frequency assignments to the single terms @xmath116 in the product .",
    "the crucial point is now that , since by the induction hypothesis each of the @xmath117 , all the corresponding products in the sum are proportional to @xmath118 , where each of the incoming frequencies @xmath119 is assigned to exactly one of the factors @xmath67 .",
    "the only difference lies in the different prefactors of @xmath118 for different terms in the sum .",
    "moreover , since also @xmath95 ( from which all these unconnected terms have to be subtracted ) has the same structure [ see eq .",
    "( [ claimt ] ) ] , the same must hold for @xmath110 which concludes our proof .",
    "\\(ii ) after we have have identified the functional form of @xmath102 as given in eq .",
    "( [ equ : ansatzconnect ] ) we are left with the second ( and final ) task of determining the prefactor @xmath107 . to this end we will present a diagrammatic procedure that removes systematically from the one - particle connected part of @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath84 , all disconnected contributions .",
    "this will be achieved by choosing ( without loss of generality ) one `` reference''-frequency , say @xmath120 , and classify all subtracted ( disconnected ) diagrams with respect to this frequency .",
    "let us start with disconnected diagrams where the frequency @xmath120 is connected only to _ one _ other frequency @xmath121 and the remaining frequencies @xmath122 belong to all possible ( one - particle disconnected ) ( @xmath123)-particle diagrams . as was shown in sec .",
