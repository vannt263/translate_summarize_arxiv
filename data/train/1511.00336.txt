    "low - luminosity gamma - ray bursts ( llgrbs ) are a subclass of long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) that , although rarely detected and not yet well understood , have the potential to shed light on more commonly observed cosmological bursts . though the uncertainty is large ,",
    "estimated volumetric rates indicate that llgrbs occur some @xmath9 times more often than typical grbs @xcite , making them a compelling population for further study .",
    "in addition , llgrbs take place nearby , so the associated supernovae ( sne ) can be detected easily and studied in detail , placing constraints on energetics and circumstellar environment and giving clues about the sn - grb connection .",
    "phenomena like central engine activity , jet - star and jet - wind interactions , and the transition from beamed to spherical outflow can be probed more thoroughly than is possible at high redshift , and any insight into the radiation mechanisms of llgrbs can inform our understanding of the grb population at large .    among known llgrb sources ,",
    "the remarkably similar sources grb 060218/sn 2006aj @xcite and grb",
    "100316d / sn 2010bh @xcite stand out as unique due to their long time - scale , smooth single - peaked light curve , anomalously soft and bright x - ray afterglow , and the presence of significant thermal x - ray and optical components at early times @xcite .",
    "several important and compelling questions concerning these two bursts remain open . in a narrow sense , the atypical prompt emission ,",
    "the origin of the x - ray blackbody component , and the unusual x - ray afterglow are hard to explain in terms of standard grb theory . in a broader sense , we do not know whether the progenitor system is the same as for typical grbs : do these ultra - long llgrbs represent the low - luminosity end of a continuum of collapsar explosions , or a different stellar endpoint altogether ?",
    "the answer to this question has important implications for high - mass stellar evolution , the connection between sne and grbs , and the low - energy limits of grb physics , especially considering that events similar to grb 060218 and grb 100316d are likely more common than cosmological grbs .",
    "the peculiar nature of these bursts , the wealth of timely observations in many wavebands ( especially for grb 060218 ) , and the lack of a consensus picture for their behaviour make these particular llgrbs prime targets for theory .",
    "accordingly , a wide variety of models have been proposed to explain the many facets of grb 060218 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite originally modeled the prompt x - ray emission as shock breakout from a circumstellar shell at @xmath10 cm . the breakout duration in this case , assuming spherical symmetry , is only a few hundred seconds ; however , @xcite suggested asphericity as a means to lengthen the burst time - scale . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite argued against the shock breakout interpretation , showing that fine tuning is required to bring about a large change in breakout time - scale through asymmetrical effects .",
    "@xcite presented an alternative synchrotron self - absorption model for the prompt emission , but the high brightness temperature and small emitting area in their model are at odds with radio observations , which suggest only mildly relativistic speeds @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that compton scattering of soft input photons off relativistic external shocks driven by an inner outflow could roughly reproduce the observed prompt light curve . in the same vein",
    ", @xcite showed that a fermi acceleration mechanism could upscatter breakout thermal photons , creating a high energy power law tail to the thermal distribution .",
    "however , it is unlikely that thermal equilibrium is obtained in a relativistic breakout , and photon energies are limited by compton losses @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite investigated the prompt uv / optical emission , and demonstrated that shock breakout could reproduce the optical flux , given a large breakout radius of @xmath11 cm .",
    "( this large radius was initially viewed as a problem ; see , however , the discussion in section [ sb ] below . ) @xcite also put forth a model for the prompt uv , based on optically thick cyclotron emission .",
    "@xcite showed that an early uv / optical peak could be attributed to cooling emission from an extended low - mass circumstellar envelope shock - heated by the passage of fast sn ejecta .",
    "they did not discuss the case of sn 2006aj , although it appears in their figure 1 as an example of extended envelope interaction .",
    "another possibility for the prompt emission is that grb 060218 is an ordinary grb jet viewed off - axis .",
    "however , a solely geometrical effect should result in a frequency - independent , or achromatic , break in the light curve , whereas the break in grb 060218 is chromatic in nature @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered a scenario for grb 060218 in which primary radiation scatters off material",
    "radiatively accelerated slightly off - axis from the line of sight ; this acceleration can explain the chromatic behaviour of the afterglow .",
    "however , as their model still required an unusually soft , long - duration , and low - luminosity primary photon source , it did not give insight into the fundamental factor distinguishing llgrbs from most bursts .",
    "@xcite and @xcite tackled the x - ray and radio afterglow . in each case , the radio could be explained by a synchrotron self - absorption in a wide ( @xmath12 ) , mildly relativistic ( @xmath13@xmath14 ) outflow , but the high x - ray afterglow flux could not be accounted for in a simple external shock synchrotron model .",
    "@xcite attributed this x - ray excess to a forming magnetar , while @xcite preferred late - time fallback accretion on to a central compact object .",
    "@xcite suggested that the radio afterglow was better explained by the late non - relativistic phase of an initially collimated jet outflow .",
    "they inferred a jet luminosity @xmath15ergs@xmath2 , an initial jet lorentz factor @xmath16 , and an initial jet opening angle @xmath17 , and showed that a hot low - luminosity jet could successfully penetrate a wr star and expand upon breakout to achieve these initial conditions . based on the smooth light curve and long engine duration",
    ", they posited a neutron star - powered rather than black hole - powered central engine .",
    "@xcite calculated the synchrotron afterglow light curves from a relativistic shock breakout , and while their model could fit the radio emission of grb 060218 , it predicted too low a flux and too shallow a temporal decay for the x - ray afterglow . @xcite analysed the x - ray afterglows of 12 nearby grbs and established that grb 060218 and grb 100316d belong to a distinct subgroup marked by long duration , soft - photon index , and high absorption .",
    "they proposed the possibility that these afterglows are in fact dust echoes from shells @xmath18tens of parsecs across that form at the interface between the progenitor s stellar wind and the ism .    until recently , most existing models have focused on explaining a particular aspect of this burst ( e.g. , the prompt nonthermal emission , the radio afterglow , or the optical emission ) , while leaving the other components to speculation .",
    "@xcite recently suggested a model that attempts to unify the prompt x - rays , early optical peak , and radio emission . in his picture , the prompt x - ray and optical emission arise from the interaction of a typical grb jet with a low - mass envelope surrounding the progenitor star .",
    "the short - lived jet is able to tunnel through the progenitor star , but is choked in the envelope , powering a quasi - spherical , mildly relativistic explosion akin to a low - mass sn .",
    "the prompt x - rays are produced by the shock breaking out of the optically thick envelope ( as described in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and optical radiation is emitted as the envelope expands and cools ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "interaction of the breakout ejecta with circumstellar material ( csm ) generates the radio via synchrotron radiation ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "nakar s model does not , however , explain the unusual x - ray afterglow or the presence of thermal x - rays at early times .    in this paper , we present a plausible alternative to nakar s model for this peculiar burst , building on previous jet models . in section [ observations ] , we give an overview of observations of grb 060218 , and discuss the key features that must be reproduced by any model . in section [ sb ] , we address some problems with a straightforward shock breakout view for the prompt emission , and provide motivation for adopting a long - lived jet instead . in section [ model ] , we describe how each component of the observed radiation is generated in our engine - driven model for grb 060218 , and check that our picture is self - consistent .",
    "advantages , drawbacks , and predictions of our model , ramifications for grb classification , and future prospects are discussed in section [ discussion ] , before we conclude in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the x - ray evolution of grb 060218 and grb 100316d can be divided into a prompt phase , an exponential or steep power - law decline , and an afterglow phase .",
    "remarkably , these two objects share many observational features , perhaps suggesting that they have similar origins . in both objects ,",
    "we see :    * prompt nonthermal x - rays and @xmath6-rays with a band - like spectrum , but with lower luminosity , lower peak energy , and longer time - scale as compared to cosmological grbs . * thermal x - rays with roughly constant temperature @xmath19kev over the first @xmath20s . * strong thermal uv / optical emission on a time - scale of hours to days . *",
    "a radio afterglow lasting tens of days and implying mildly relativistic outflow . * an x - ray afterglow that is brighter and softer than expected in standard synchrotron models .    any unified model for these bursts must account for each of these components .",
    "here we summarise multiwavelength observations during the prompt and afterglow phases of grb 060218 and grb 100316d .    *",
    "prompt x - rays/@xmath6-rays : * the nonthermal spectrum of grb 060218 from @xmath21s to @xmath22s is well fit by a band function @xcite with low - energy photon index @xmath23 and high - energy photon index @xmath24 , implying @xmath25 at low energies and @xmath26 at high energies . @xmath27 and @xmath28 remain roughly constant over the evolution @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a somewhat different low - energy index , @xmath29 , when fitting the spectrum with a cut - off power law instead of a band function .",
    "these values are typical for long grbs @xcite .",
    "the peak energy @xmath30 of the best - fitting band function decreases as @xmath31 from @xmath32s until the end of the prompt phase . at @xmath33s , @xmath34kev @xcite . despite its low luminosity , grb 060218",
    "obeys the amati correlation between @xmath30 and luminosity @xcite .",
    "in addition to the nonthermal band function , a significant soft thermal component was detected in the spectrum .",
    "@xcite found that the blackbody temperature remains nearly constant at @xmath35kev throughout the prompt phase @xcite . a later analysis by @xcite determined a slightly lower temperature , @xmath36kev , for times after several hundred seconds ( see their figure 7 ) .",
    "the prompt xrt ( @xmath37@xmath38kev ) light curve of grb 060218 can be decomposed into contributions from the thermal and nonthermal parts ; the nonthermal component dominates until approximately 3000 s ( @xcite ; see also figure 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "the total ( nonthermal + thermal ) isotropic - equivalent luminosity in the xrt band grows as @xmath39 for the first @xmath40s , when it reaches a peak luminosity @xmath41ergs@xmath2 , then declines as roughly @xmath42 until @xmath43s , fading exponentially or as a steep power law after that @xcite .",
    "the thermal component initially comprises about @xmath44 of the total xrt band luminosity , and its light curve evolves similarly : at first it increases as a power law , rising steadily as @xmath45 @xcite until it peaks at @xmath46ergs@xmath2 at @xmath47s @xcite . at that time , the thermal and nonthermal luminosities are about equal , but during the steep decline phase ( @xmath48@xmath49s ) , the thermal component comes to dominate the luminosity , indicating that the nonthermal part must decline more steeply @xcite .",
    "the light curve in the bat band ( @xmath50@xmath51kev ) is initially very similar to the xrt light curve , increasing as about @xmath52 with roughly the same luminosity . though its maximum luminosity ( @xmath41ergs@xmath2 ) is similar to the peak xrt flux , the bat flux peaks earlier , at @xmath53s .",
    "furthermore , it decays faster after the peak , falling off as @xmath54 from @xmath55@xmath48s @xcite .",
    "evidence for a blackbody spectral component has also been claimed for grb 100316d , with a similar constant temperature @xmath56kev @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of this thermal component has been called into question based on a large change in its statistical significance with the latest xrt calibration software @xcite .",
    "the nonthermal spectrum of this burst is similar to that of grb 060218 : its peak energy has about the same magnitude and declines in a similar fashion , and its low - energy photon index is also nearly the same over the first @xmath57 seconds ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure 4 ) .",
    "compared to grb 060218 , grb 100316d is more luminous in the xrt band , with @xmath58ergs@xmath2 . in this case , the xrt light curve has nearly constant luminosity ( @xmath59 ) for the first @xmath60s @xcite .",
    "( for this burst , there are no x - ray data available from @xmath60@xmath61s . ) if the light curve is broken into blackbody and band function components , the nonthermal flux strongly dominates over the thermal contribution , with @xmath62 .",
    "* optical photometry : * from the first detection of grb 060218 at a few hundred seconds , the uv / optical emission slowly rises to a peak , first in the uv at @xmath63ks , and then in the optical at @xmath64ks @xcite .",
    "the light curves dipped to a minimum at around @xmath65ks , after which a second peak occurred around @xmath60ks , which can be attributed to the emergence of light from the supernova sn 2006aj .",
    "like other grb - supernovae , 2006aj is a broad - lined type ic @xcite , but its kinetic energy @xmath66erg is an order of magnitude smaller than usual @xcite .",

    "its x - ray spectrum is also very soft , with @xmath85 over the period @xmath76@xmath38days @xcite . because of the gap in coverage , it is unclear precisely when the prompt phase ends and the afterglow phase begins .",
    "grb 100316d was detected at @xmath86ghz from @xmath87@xmath88days , with a peak at that frequency at @xmath89days @xcite .",
    "this peak comes much later than that of grb 060218 , where the @xmath90ghz peak occurred at @xmath91@xmath14days @xcite .",

    "no jet break is detected out to @xmath93days , and the estimated lorentz factor is again mildly relativistic , @xmath94@xmath91 on day 1 @xcite .",
    "the majority of models for the prompt x - rays of grb 060218 fall into two categories : shock breakout ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) or ic scattering of blackbody radiation by external shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the latter type requires seed thermal photons for ic upscattering ; while @xcite and @xcite assumed these photons were produced by a shock breakout event , other thermal sources such as a dissipative jet are also possible . here , we point out some difficulties with a shock breakout interpretation of the prompt x - ray emission , and suggest some reasons to consider a long - lived central engine scenario instead",
    ".    early models for grb 060218 @xcite considered the case where matter and radiation are in thermal equilibrium behind the shock , and the thermal x - rays and thermal uv / optical emission arise from shell interaction and shock breakout , respectively . however , for sufficiently fast shocks the radiation immediately downstream of the shock is out of thermal equilibrium , so the breakout temperature can be higher than when equilibrium is assumed @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the prompt emission peaks in x - rays and the prompt spectrum is a broken power law with @xmath25 at low energies and @xmath95 at high energies @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the band function spectrum observed in grb 060218 , motivating consideration of the case where the nonthermal x - rays originate from a relativistic shock breakout while the thermal uv / optical component comes from a later equilibrium phase of the breakout , as described in @xcite .",
    "this interpretation still has possible problems .",
    "for one , the origin of a separate thermal x - ray component is unclear in this picture .",
    "in addition , the evolution of the prompt peak energy differs from the shock breakout interpretation . in grb 060218 , the peak energy falls off as @xmath96 , while in the shock breakout model it declines more slowly as @xmath97 .",
    "consequently , while the peak energy inferred from relativistic shock breakout , @xmath98kev , is consistent with observations at early times ( less than a few hundred seconds ) , it overestimates @xmath30 for most of the prompt phase .",
    "another problem is that the optical blackbody emission is observed from the earliest time in grb 060218 , and it rises smoothly in all uvot bands until peak . in the nonequilibrium shock breakout scenario , thermal optical emission",
    "would not be expected until later times , when equilibrium has been attained .",
    "a final issue with the shock breakout picture of @xcite is that it involved a stellar mass explosion . since only a small fraction of",
    "the energy goes into relativistic material in a standard sn explosion , the energy required for the breakout to be relativistic was extreme , @xmath99ergs .",
    "this high energy is inconsistent with the unremarkable energy of the observed sn , @xmath100ergs .",
    "one can also consider the case where the prompt optical emission is attributed to shock breakout , but the prompt x - rays have a different origin .",
    "the large initial radius in this case is incompatible with a bare wr star , and initially seemed to rule out a wr progenitor @xcite .",
    "however , this calculation assumed that much of the stellar mass was located close to the breakout radius .",
    "an extended optically thick region containing a relatively small amount of mass could circumvent this difficulty .",
    "such an envelope might be created by pre - explosion mass loss or a binary interaction .",
    "there is mounting evidence for the existence of such dense stellar environments around other transients such as sn type iin ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , sn type iib @xcite , sn type ibn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and sn type ia - csm @xcite .",
    "the model of @xcite builds on the relativistic shock breakout model of @xcite , while solving several of its problems .",
    "@xcite introduces a low - mass , optically thick envelope around a compact progenitor . in his model ,",
    "the explosion powering the breakout is driven not by the sn , but by a jet that tunnels out of the progenitor star and is choked in the envelope , powering a quasi - spherical explosion . having a large optically thick region preserves the long shock breakout time - scale ,",
    "but in this case most of the mass is concentrated in a compact core .",
    "since the envelope mass is much smaller than the star s mass , the energy required for a relativistic breakout is reduced as compared to the model of @xcite .",
    "this picture also provides a natural explanation for the optical blackbody component via cooling emission from the shocked envelope .",
    "however , since the prompt x - rays still arise from a relativistic shock breakout , nakar s model inherits some problems from that scenario as well , namely that the predicted peak energy evolution is too shallow , and the thermal x - rays lack a definitive origin .",
    "it remains unclear , too , whether nakar s model can account for the simultaneous observation of optical and x - ray emission at early times .",
    "given the possible difficulties with shock breakout , a different source for the prompt x - ray radiation should be considered .",
    "@xcite have shown that a central engine origin for certain llgrbs is unlikely as their duration ( @xmath101 ) is short compared to the breakout time . however , due to their relatively long @xmath101 , engine - driven models are not ruled out for grb 060218 and grb 100316d .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in section [ observations ] , the prompt x - ray/@xmath6-ray emission of grb 060218 shares much in common with typical grbs .",
    "as these similarities would be a peculiar coincidence in the shock breakout view , a collapsar jet origin for grb 060218 is worth considering .",
    "motivated by this , we consider the case where the early optical emission is powered by interaction of the sn ejecta with a circumstellar envelope , but the prompt x - rays originate from a long - lived jet .",

    "the essential physical ingredients are a long - lived jet , an extended low - mass circumstellar envelope , and a modest amount of dust at tens of parsecs , which are responsible for the prompt x - rays / radio afterglow , early optical , and x - ray afterglow , respectively .",
    "below we consider the origin of each observed component in detail , and show that a reasonable match to observations can be obtained for appropriate choices of the progenitor , jet , and csm properties .",
    "the thermal x - ray component is a puzzling aspect of grb 060218 , and it is not unique in this regard . a recent review by @xcite lists a number of typical grbs for which a band @xmath110 blackbody model improves the spectral fit , which has been claimed as evidence for thermal emission .",
    "@xcite have also found evidence for thermal radiation in several other bursts .",
    "in fact , @xcite have recently suggested that _ most _ bursts must contain a broadened thermal component , because in the majority of observed bursts , the full width half maximum of the spectral peak is narrower than is physically possible for synchrotron radiation .",
    "although prompt thermal radiation is observationally indicated , the physical origin of this emission is yet unclear .",
    "one possible source of thermal x - rays is a jet - blown cocoon , although the flat early light curve of grb 060218 and grb 100316d is hard to explain in this case @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that the blackbody emission is produced at the transparency radius in a dissipative jet outflow , as discussed in the context of grb 060218 by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "here we consider the latter scenario .",
    "@xcite , who considered photospheric emission from super - eddington neutron star winds , showed that the photospheric radius in a spherical mildly relativistic outflow is @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the isotropic mass loss rate , @xmath113 is the speed of light , @xmath73 is the the wind velocity in units of @xmath113 , @xmath114 is the opacity , and @xmath115 is the optical depth at the photosphere .",
    "let @xmath116 and @xmath117 be the observer - frame luminosity and temperature , and define the lorentz factor @xmath118 .",

    "note that the photosphere lies within the radius of the low - mass envelope , @xmath155 cm , that we derive in section [ optical ] below , suggesting that dissipation occurs within the envelope .",
    "the time @xmath126 corresponds to the time when the central engine shuts off .    in the above calculation ,",
    "we have assumed for simplicity that the jet outflow is directed into an uncollimated cone . however , as we show in section [ jet_propagation ] , the jet may be collimated within the envelope , and become uncollimated only after breaking out .",
    "the decollimation time - scale can be estimated as the time for the jet s cocoon to expand and become dynamically unimportant after breakout , which is @xmath156s , where @xmath157 is the sound speed .",
    "this is short compared to the duration of prompt emission ; therefore , _ outside _ of the envelope , the assumption of an uncollimated outflow is reasonable for most of the prompt phase .",
    "however , it appears that the photosphere is _ within _ the envelope .",
    "the decollimation time - scale there might be longer because it will take the jet some time to excavate the walls of the narrow hole left by its passage .",
    "collimation has the joint effect of decreasing the outflow s opening angle ( due to the confining effect of the cocoon ) and decreasing its lorentz factor ( due to more of the total jet energy going into internal versus kinetic energy ) .",
    "both of these effects lead to a smaller @xmath158 and @xmath159 , for the same observed thermal luminosity and temperature .",
    "thus , by ignoring collimation we potentially overestimate these quantities ; our derived mass loss rate and kinetic luminosity should really be viewed as upper limits .",
    "the optical / uv extinction and the x - ray absorption to grb 060218 are crucial for the interpretation of observations of the event , as well as giving information on gas and dust along the line of sight .",
    "the early optical / uv emission is strongly weighted to the ultraviolet , which is especially sensitive to absorption .",
    "the amount of galactic absorption is not controversial ; extinction maps of the galaxy yield @xmath160mag , while the galactic na i d lines indicate @xmath161mag @xcite .",
    "the reddening has been estimated from the narrow na i d lines in the host galaxy as being @xmath162mag , or @xmath163mag @xcite . as noted by @xcite , a larger reddening is possible if there is ionization in the host galaxy . however , the properties of the host galaxy derived from fitting the spectral energy distribution and the observed balmer line decrement point to a low extinction so @xcite advocate the low value obtained from the na i d line .",
    "our model for the late - time x - rays ( see section [ xray_afterglow ] ) also suggests a similar low extinction .",
    "a higher host galaxy reddening , @xmath164mag , was advocated by @xcite and @xcite because the early ( @xmath165day ) emission could be fitted by a rayleigh - jeans spectrum , consistent with high temperature emission .",
    "this suggestion allowed a shock breakout model for both the thermal x - ray emission and the early optical emission .",
    "this value of the reddening was also used by @xcite , who noted that the implied blackbody temperature is @xmath166k .",
    "@xcite advocates the large reddening based on the slow color evolution leading up to the peak , which is expected in the rayleigh - jeans limit .",
    "however , his model could in principle accommodate a smaller extinction , if the model is consistent with a constant temperature leading to the peak .    in view of the lack of direct evidence for the larger values of extinction in the host , we take the small value that is directly indicated .",
    "@xcite had derived some of the observed parameters for grb 060218 based on galactic extinction only . as expected ,",
    "the spectrum is then not well approximated by a rayleigh - jeans spectrum and a temperature in the range @xmath167@xmath168k is deduced over the first half day .",
    "a blackbody fit gives the radius at the time of peak luminosity , @xmath169 cm , which yields a luminosity of @xmath170ergs@xmath2 .",
    "this can be compared to the luminosity @xmath171ergs@xmath2 found by @xcite in his larger extinction model .",
    "the x - ray absorption column density has been obtained by fitting the observed spectrum to a model with a power - law continuum , a blackbody thermal component and interstellar absorption ; @xcite obtain an absorbing hydrogen column density of @xmath172@xmath173 over 10 spectra covering the time of peak luminosity .",

    "our findings support their suggestion that the very soft spectrum of grb 060218 arises from a dust echo , but as the amount of dust in our model is not particularly high , an especially dense shell is not necessary ; the dust could exist in an ism of typical density and chemistry .",

    "our results can be compared to two other objects for which dust echo models have been proposed , grb 130925a @xcite and grb 090417b @xcite .",
    "the optical extinction inferred from modeling the afterglow as a dust echo is @xmath268mag in grb 130925a , @xcite , and in grb 090417b it is @xmath269mag @xcite . in each case , the amount of dust required to fit the x - ray afterglow via an echo _ is _ consistent with the absorbing hydrogen column needed to fit the x - ray spectrum @xcite . in grb 090417b",
    ", the high extinction can also explain the lack of an optical detection @xcite .",
    "in contrast to grb 060218 and grb 100316d , grb 130925a and grb 090417b appear to have taken place in an unusually dusty environment , with the dust accounting for both the x - ray scattering afterglow and the large @xmath174 .",
    "interestingly , these bursts also differ in their prompt emission .",
    "grb 130925a appears typical of the ultra - long class of objects described by @xcite , which also includes grb 101225a , grb 111209a , and grb 121027a .",
    "compared to grb 060218 and grb 100316d , these ultra - long bursts are more luminous and longer lived , and they show variability in their light curves on short time - scales , reminiscent of typical grbs @xcite .",
    "the light curve of grb 090417b is qualitatively similar to grb 130925a , and it likewise has a longer time - scale , higher luminosity , and more variability compared to grb 060218 @xcite .",

    "it seems , then , that three discrete subclasses are needed to explain their observations : 1 ) smooth light curve , very low - luminosity ultra - long bursts like grb 060218/grb 100316d , with echo - like afterglows implying a modest amount of dust ; 2 ) spiky light curve , somewhat low - luminosity ultra - long bursts like grb 130925a / grb 090417b , with echo - like afterglows implying a large amount of dust ; and 3 ) spiky - light curve bursts with typical time - scale and luminosity , and synchrotron afterglows .",
    "the underlying reason why the afterglow is dominated by dust - scattered prompt emission in some cases , and synchrotron emission from external shocks in others , is unclear .",
    "one possibility is that kinetic energy is efficiently converted to radiation during the prompt phase , resulting in a lower kinetic energy during the afterglow phase as discussed by @xcite in the context of grb 130925a .",
    "a second possibility is that the external shocks do not effectively couple energy to postshock electrons and/or magnetic fields .",
    "we return to this question at the end of section  [ prompt_nonthermal ] .",
    "an essential feature of the radio afterglow in grb 060218 is that it shows no evidence for a jet break , but instead decays as a shallow power law in time , with @xmath79 at @xmath270ghz @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the steepening is due to a combination of two effects that reduce the observed flux : when the jet decelerates to @xmath276 , the jet edge comes into view , and also the jet begins to expand laterally .",
    "the same general behaviour of the radio light curve is also seen in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the steep decay lasts until a time @xmath277 , which is the time - scale for the flow to become quasi - spherical if sideways expansion is fast , i.e. if the increase in radius during sideways expansion is negligible @xcite . while detailed simulations have demonstrated that the transition to spherical outflow is much more gradual and that the flow remains collimated and transrelativistic at @xmath277 @xcite , numerical light curves none the less confirm that analytical estimates of the radio flux that assume sphericity and nonrelativistic flow remain approximately valid for on - axis observers at @xmath278 @xcite .",
    "after @xmath277 , the light curve gradually flattens as the flow tends toward the sedov ",
    "taylor solution , eventually becoming fully nonrelativistic on a time - scale @xmath200 .",
    "therefore , the smooth and relatively flat light curve of grb 060218 over the period @xmath91@xmath279days suggests one of two possibilities : either we observed the relativistic phase of an initially wide outflow that took @xmath280days to enter the steep decay phase , or we observed the late phase of an outflow that became transrelativistic in @xmath281days and that may have been beamed originally .    in either scenario , a light curve as shallow as @xmath282 is not easily produced in the standard synchrotron afterglow model .",
    "one issue is that such a shallow decay suggests that the circumstellar density profile and postshock electron spectrum are both flatter than usual . throughout the period of radio observations , the characteristic frequency @xmath283 , the synchrotron self - absorption frequency @xmath284 , and the cooling frequency @xmath285",
    "are related by @xmath286 @xcite . as the @xmath270ghz band lies between @xmath284 and @xmath285 , the expected light curve slope in the relativistic case",

    "@xcite estimated that the size of the radio - emitting region is @xmath357 cm at @xmath358 days , so the emitting volume at that time can be approximated by @xmath359@xmath360 . at the same time , the flux density at @xmath361ghz was @xmath362 , implying a specific luminosity @xmath363ergs@xmath2hz@xmath2 given the distance @xmath364mpc . with these parameters ,",

    ", this implies about the same burst energy , but a circumstellar density that is higher by a factor of @xmath374@xmath40 @xcite , even for a quasi - spherical outflow .",
    "it seems unusual that the progenitors of these similar bursts have such different circumstellar environments .",
    "in addition , the higher density leads to a _ smaller _",

    "this problem is alleviated by considering a wind - like medium as in @xcite , but in that case the expected light curve is @xmath376 for @xmath377 , which seems too steep to fit observations unless one adopts @xmath378 .    one can consider the nonrelativistic case instead , but due to the weak dependence on @xmath327 and @xmath328 , the condition on @xmath277 is also hard to satisfy unless the burst energy is extremely low or the csm is extremely dense .",
    "in addition , because the flow is still highly aspherical at @xmath379 , the model light curve slope will be too steep if @xmath380 only holds marginally , even if the flux is approximately correct .",
    "the slope does not settle to the limiting sedov ",
    "taylor value until the outflow sphericizes , which according to numerical simulations does not occur until @xmath381 @xcite .",
    "however , so far we have assumed that the csm near the progenitor star is the same as the csm at @xmath18 a few @xmath382 cm where the radio is emitted .",
    "it is possible that the circumstellar environment is more complicated , and in particular that the csm density is higher closer to the progenitor star .",
    "in fact , there is some evidence that this is the case .",
    "the x - ray absorption column , @xmath383@xmath173 , measured during the prompt phase is higher than one would expect for a constant density medium with @xmath303@xmath304 , even if that medium extended to @xmath67pc scales .",
    "thus , we speculate that the shell emitting the radio could have undergone additional deceleration by sweeping up the material responsible for x - ray absorption at some time @xmath384days . while the absorbing column through the expanding outflow is expected to change with time , the measured @xmath174 is constant during the prompt phase .",
    "therefore , the bulk of the absorbing material would have to lie outside the jet throughout the first @xmath385s .",
    "note that @xmath174 also stays constant throughout the x - ray afterglow from @xmath385@xmath386s , but this does not provide any additional constraints on our model , since the afterglow in our picture is a light echo and thus inherits the absorption of the prompt component ( see section [ xray_afterglow ] ) . hence most of the absorbing mass must be confined to the radial range @xmath387 .",
    "taking @xmath388 , where @xmath389 is the lorentz factor of the forward shock , we find @xmath390 .",
    "the total mass of absorbing material , assuming it is distributed isotropically , is @xmath391 , so @xmath392 .",
    "note that less absorbing mass is necessary if it is located closer to the star , or if it is distributed preferentially along the poles .",
    "the jet will sweep a mass @xmath393 , which is sufficient to decelerate it to nonrelativistic speeds if @xmath394 . from equation ( [ mj ] ) , @xmath395 for the parameters of grb 060218 , thus we find @xmath396 @xmath397 is possible to satisfy for @xmath398 , and is always satisfied for @xmath399 .",
    "therefore , for the mildly relativistic case we consider , it seems plausible that the mass responsible for the x - ray absorption could also be responsible for decelerating the jet .",
    "the conditions @xmath400 , @xmath335 , @xmath401 , @xmath402 hz , and the constraint on @xmath272 ( or @xmath277 ) can be conveniently expressed in the @xmath326@xmath322 plane .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ radioconstraints ] .",
    "( we do not plot the line @xmath403 as it is largely irrelevant as long as @xmath404 . )",

    "however , because @xmath272 is sensitive to @xmath106 , the available parameter space rapidly shrinks when @xmath106 is reduced : the green region disappears from the plot when @xmath408 , and the yellow region when @xmath409 .",
    "thus , the relativistic scenario disfavors a tightly collimated outflow for any sensible combination of @xmath326 and @xmath322 . in the nonrelativistic case , shown in the middle panel",
