    "many models have been proposed to explain a phenomenon of high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations observed in neutron - star low - mass x - ray binaries ( hf qpos in lmxbs ) .",
    "it is believed that hf qpos are carrying signatures of strong gravity and dense matter composition .",
    "serious theoretical effort has been devoted to explain the observed frequencies and their correlations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for further informations and a large list of references to various individual models of hf qpos ) . in this section",
    "we only briefly recall two particular outstanding theoretical frameworks .",
    "one of the first qpo models , the so called relativistic - precession model ( rp model ) identifies the twin - peak khz qpo frequencies @xmath1 and @xmath2 with two fundamental frequencies of a nearly circular geodesic motion : the keplerian orbital frequency and the periastron - precession frequency , @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the radial epicyclic frequency",
    ". the correlations among them is then obtained by varying the radius of the underlying circular orbit in a reasonable range . within this framework",
    "it is usually assumed that the variable component of the observed x - ray signal originates in a bright localized spot or blob orbiting the neutron star on a slightly eccentric orbit .",
    "the observed radiation is then periodically modulated due to the relativistic effects .",
    "it has been shown that the model is roughly matching the observed @xmath5 correlations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the rp model also suffers some theoretical difficulties .",
    "it is not clear whether the modulation of a radiation from a small localized spot can produce sufficiently strong signal modulation to explain a relatively large observed hf qpo amplitudes .",
    "it is then expected that larger spots ( giving higher amount of modulated photons ) can undergo a serious shearing due to the differential rotation in the surrounding accretion disc .",
    "this does not agree with a high coherence of the hf qpo signal which is often observed .",
    "the model also lacks an explanation of inferred existence of preferred orbits which should be responsible for appearance of hf qpo pairs ( twin peaks ) and clustering of their frequencies .",
    "only slightly later , @xcite and @xcite proposed the concept of orbital resonance models . within this concept ,",
    "hf qpos originate in resonances between oscillation modes of the accreted fluid .",
    "the most quoted , so - called 3:2 epicyclic resonance model , identifies the resonant eigenfrequencies with frequencies @xmath6 and @xmath7 of radial and vertical epicyclic axisymmetric modes of disc ( or torus ) oscillations .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath8 while the correlation @xmath5 arises from resonant corrections to the eigenfrequencies @xcite .",
    "we stress that the model deals with a collective motion of the accreted matter .",
    "moreover , the oscillation modes of innermost region of the accretion flow can modulate the amount of matter transferred to ns surface through the boundary layer @xcite .",
    "therefore , it may naturally explain both high amplitudes and coherence of the hf qpos .",
    "nevertheless , it is questionable whether the resonant corrections to the eigenfrequencies can be large enough to explain the whole observed range of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the model implies large range of ns masses and has difficulties when confronted to models of rotating ns based on up - to - date equations of state ( eos ,  see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    motivated by partial success of the above models and their complementary difficulties , we present a modified framework for interpreting the hf qpos .",
    "our model is largely based on the theoretical work of @xcite .",
    "we adopt kerr geometry to describe slowly rotating compact ns .",
    "we assume that the innermost region of accretion flow is hot enough to form a pressure supported torus of a moderate thickness . assuming a non - relativistic polytropic equation of state and neglecting the poloidal components of the fluid velocity ( so that the fluid follows circular orbits ) , the equilibrium torus shape and its structure are completely determined by the lane - embden function , which is given by a simple analytic formula @xcite @xmath9 in this equation",
    ", @xmath10 denotes the energy of a particle on a ( non - geodesic ) circular orbit having the specific angular momentum @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that the angular momentum is constant in the whole volume of the torus , @xmath12 . since we assume that the torus is located in the vicinity of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco , @xmath13 ) where also keplerian angular momentum",
    "is nearly constant , we believe it is a reasonable approximation .",
    "meaning of other symbols in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lane - embden ] ) is straightforward : @xmath14 is the polytropic index ( @xmath15 for a radiation pressure dominated fluid ) and @xmath16 is the sound speed at the center of the torus located at radius @xmath0 in the equatorial plane , where the pressure gradient vanishes and energy @xmath10 takes the value @xmath17 .",
    "vanishing of the pressure forces at the torus center implies the streamline @xmath18 , @xmath19 to be a geodesic line because of which the fluid angular momentum takes keplerian value at that radius , @xmath20 .",
    "the surfaces of constant density and pressure coincide with those of constant @xmath21 and their values can be calculated from @xmath21 by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 refer to the values at the torus center that corresponds to @xmath26 . on the other hand , the surface of the torus , where both pressure and density vanishes , is given by the condition @xmath27 .",
    "it is also worth to note that the position of the center @xmath0 and the shape of these surfaces are entirely given by the value of @xmath28 and the spacetime geometry , while the particular values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 and consequently the location of the overall surface of the torus are set by the central value of the sound speed @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite introduce a dimesionless parameter @xmath31 that characterizes the size of the torus , @xmath32 this parameter is roughly proportional to the mach number of the flow at the torus center as can be seen from its newtonian limit @xmath33 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , it is also roughly proportional to the ratio of the radial ( or vertical ) extension of the torus to its central radius @xmath0 . hence , the sound - crossing time and the dynamical timescale of the torus are roughly similar",
    ".      the stationary solution does not exist for an arbitrary large value of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the obvious limit @xmath34 corresponding to tori whose outer edge extends to infinity , there is a much stronger constrain coming from general relativity that significantly limits the torus size close to isco .",
    "large enough tori that extend below the isco radius , may be terminated there by a `` cusp '' , where the rotation of the flow becomes keplerian again .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the keplerian angular momentum reaches its minimum at isco .",
    "the cusp corresponds to a saddle point of the lane - embden function and the corresponding self - crossing equipotential limits the surface of any stationary rotating fluid configuration with given angular momentum @xmath28 .",
    "fluid that appear outside this surface , is accreted onto the central star on the dynamical timescale driven by gravity and pressure forces without need of viscosity @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated analytically the accretion rate from a slightly overflowing torus , their result agrees very well with numerical simulations .",
    "the critical value of @xmath31 giving a marginally overflowing torus follows from equations ( [ eq : lane - embden ] ) and ( [ eq : beta ] ) , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the particle energy at the cusp .",
    "its location @xmath37 can be found by equating the keplerian angular momentum to the fluid angular momentum @xmath28 .",
    "this procedure leads to the third - order algebraic equation ( in @xmath38 ) , giving the position of the cusp in terms of the location of the torus center .",
    "if the stellar spin is neglected ( @xmath39 ) , the equation is reduced to the quadratic one and its solution can be expressed as @xmath40 and the critical @xmath31-parameter reads @xmath41^{1/2}}{r_\\mathrm{c } r_0(r_\\mathrm{c}-2m)^{1/2}(r_0 - 3m)^{1/2}}.\\ ] ] this can be used for @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "@xcite pointed out the existence of the radial and vertical epicyclic modes that describes a global motion of the torus .",
    "they have found that , in the limit of infinitesimally slender tori @xmath44 , frequencies of these modes @xmath45 and @xmath46 measured in the fluid reference frame coincide with the epicyclic frequencies of test particles , @xmath47 while at fixed azimuth their frequencies are given by @xmath48 and @xmath49 with @xmath50 being the integer azimuthal wavenumber . in particular , the @xmath51 radial and vertical modes give the frequencies of the periastron and nodal precession of a weakly eccentric and tilted torus .",
    "it is also worth to note that they describe a collective motion of the fluid , rather then a motion of individual particles .    in a more realistic case ,",
    "when @xmath52 , the pressure gradient contributes to the restoring force of the perturbed torus shifting their frequencies to new ` corrected ' values , @xmath53 the pressure corrections @xmath54 and @xmath54 have been calculated by @xcite using perturbation expansion in @xmath31-parameter .",
    "they found that the first nonzero corrections are of the order of @xmath55 .",
    "we identify the observed hf qpo frequencies with frequencies of the epicyclic modes of torus oscillations .",
    "we propose that the upper kilohertz qpo frequency is the keplerian orbital frequency of the fluid at the center of the torus , where both pressure and density peaks and from which most of the torus radiation emerges .",
    "the lower kilohertz qpo corresponds to the frequency of the non - axisymmetric @xmath51 radial epicyclic mode .",
    "overall , there is @xmath56 the qpo frequencies are then strong functions of the position of the center of the torus @xmath0 and its thickness @xmath31 . obviously , the choice of @xmath57 ( slender tori ) recovers the rp model frequencies . in the case of a finite thickness @xmath58 ,",
    "they also weakly depend on the value of the polytropic index @xmath14 . in next , we fix @xmath15 as the inner parts of the accretion flow are believed to be radiation - pressure dominated .",
    "we assume the cusp configuration @xmath59 in other words , we expect that for given @xmath0 the torus is always close to its maximal possible size , just filling its ` roche - like ' lobe .",
    "thus , for a given accreting central compact object , our model predicts that the qpo frequencies are functions of a single parameter @xmath0 , @xmath60\\ , .",
    "\\quad      \\ ] ] therefore , one obtains a unique correlation among them by changing this parameter in a physically reasonable range .",
    "the above equations are exact for kerr spacetimes and represent an acceptable approximation for high - mass neutron stars @xcite .",
    "another restriction on their applicability follows from the adopted description of torus dynamics assuming a second order expansion in @xmath61 .",
    "consequently we can assume only @xmath62 .",
    "for @xmath39 , this corresponds to tori with radial extension @xmath63 . neglecting the effects of neutron star rotation , equation ( [ equation : correlation ] )",
    "implies a relation between torus thickness @xmath61 and frequency ratio @xmath64 .",
    "we show this relation in figure  [ figure:1]a . from this figure",
    "we can see that our approximation can be well applied when @xmath65 , while for @xmath66 it is not sufficient .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have confronted several hf qpo models with data of the atoll source 4u 1636 - 53 displaying twin peak qpos mostly within the range of @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "they have outlined comparison between individual matches of the model to the data as well as quantitative estimates of the inferred ns parameters .",
    "the datapoints assumed in the former study come from a common processing of a large amount of data while the datapoints used in the latter study correspond to individual continuous observations of the source . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "results of both studies are consistent .",
    "here we confront the cusp torus model with the previously examined data .",
    "we primarily assume the datapoints of @xcite that span a larger range of frequencies but we also check the results for the datapoints corresponding to continuous segments of observation .      first , we investigate the case of a simple one - parametric fit assuming non - rotating ns .",
    "this way we can obtain comparison with the rp model and a rough estimate of the ns mass implied by our cusp torus model . in figure",
    "[ figure:1]b we plot the sequence of equipotential contours of cusp tori that provide the best match to the 4u  1636 - 53 data . in figure",
    "[ figure:1]c we show this best fit .",
    "the best fit of the rp model is included for the sake of comparison .",
    "clearly , the cusp torus model matches the observed trend better than the rp model .",
    "we have @xmath68 for the torus model while it is @xmath69 for the rp model . the ns mass inferred from the cusp torus model , within @xmath70 confidence level ,",
    "reads @xmath71\\,m_{\\odot}\\ , .",

    ", we may expect that the mass ( [ equation : m : nonrotating ] ) belongs to a mass  angular - momentum relation implied by the cusp torus model .",
    "the result of the two - dimensional fitting of the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 is shown in figure  [ figure:2]a .",
    "indeed , the best fits are reached when @xmath73 and @xmath74 are related through the specific relation .",
    "this relation can be approximated by a quadratic form , @xmath75 which results for each of the two datasets .",
    "there is good evidence on the ns spin frequency of 4u  163653 based on x - ray burst measurements .",
    "depending on the hot - spot model consideration , the spin @xmath76 reads either @xmath77hz or @xmath78hz @xcite .",
    "the value of 580hz is usually preferred .",
    "we can therefore roughly compare the cusp torus model predictions to predictions of models of rotating ns .      in figure",
    "[ figure:2]a we include several mass - angular momentum relations expected from models of rotating ns .",
    "we assume the following set of eos - sly 4 , apr , au - wff1 , uu - wff2 and ws - wff3 @xcite .",
    "inspecting figure  [ figure:2]a we can see that there are overlaps between the relations given by models of rotating stars and the relation inferred from the cusp torus model . in the figure",
    "we denote two particular values of angular momentum together with corresponding masses that roughly represent these overlaps . assuming the two chosen combinations of mass and angular momentum",
    ", we attempted in figure  [ figure:2]b to fit the data by the torus frequencies considering _ any _ torus thickness , not only @xmath61 .",
    "we searched for the combinations of @xmath31 and @xmath79 exactly matching each individual datapoint .",
    "clearly , the obtained values are distributed very close to the cusp relation ( [ equation : cusp ] ) , @xmath80 , where we have @xmath81 .",
    "a)b )   +      a more careful and computationaly demanding investigation of the spin influence following the work of @xcite and assuming the hartle - thorne spacetime should be applied in a consequent work following our study assuming high mass ns approximation .",
    "nevertheless , we can conclude that there is a very strong indication that twin peak qpos can be identified with a particular non - axisymmetric @xmath51 radial epicyclic mode and keplerian orbital motion associated to the cusp torus .",
    "these modes may naturally give strong modulation of both emerging radiation and the accretion rate and their eigenfunctions change only weakly on the spatial scale of the turbulent motion .",
    "they are therefore very good candidates for explaining high amplitudes of hf qpos .",
    "the presented concept has the potential to explain also the observed low frequency qpos .",
    "as noticed by @xcite and @xcite the frequencies of vertical modes seem to be very sensitive to the ns quadrupole moment .",
    "their consideration thus may exceed the framework of kerr spacetime approximation adopted here .",
    "however , we roughly investigated also the frequencies of non - axisymmetric @xmath82 vertical epicyclic mode of cusp tori .",
    "this mode corresponds to a low - frequency global precession of inclined torus and is analogical to the `` tilted hot flow precession '' discussed by @xcite .",
    "assuming the same mass , angular momentum and radii as those in figure  [ figure:2 ] we obtained values of tens of hertz that are of the same order as the observed frequencies .",
    "the @xmath51 vertical epicyclic mode may therefore play the same role in the framework of cusp torus model as the lense - thirring preccession in the framework of rp model .",
