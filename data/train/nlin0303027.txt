    "wavelets - based tools have been shown to be well - suited to fractal processes and their analysis .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the wavelet transform incorporates in its definition two basic features , time and scale , which are of primary importance for fractal processes .",
    "another remarks concerns the structure of the wavelet transform which , by construction , builds a signal by successive refinements , starting from a coarse approximation and adding finer and finer details at each step .",
    "such a procedure is of course reminiscent of basic fractal constructions , thus suggesting we should make use of wavelets to synthesize a fractal process @xcite .    since the earlier leading work of mandelbrot@xcite there is a lot of evidence that several facets of fully developed turbulent flows are fractals .",
    "most of the applications of fractals to turbulence have been devoted to the study of subsets of the region occupied by turbulent flow where a given property is satisfied .",
    "for example , the turbulent / non - turbulent interface , some constant property surfaces ( such as the iso - velocity and iso - concentration surfaces ) and the structure of spatial distribution of dissipation rates have been characterized as fractals or multifractals and the dimension has been measured @xcite . then , it is natural to apply wavelet tools for analyzing atmospheric turbulence @xcite .    the fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) was introduced by mandelbrot and van ness @xcite as an example of a process which contains an infinite domain of dependence with the intention of explaining the results reported by hurst in 1951 @xcite .",
    "fbm as a model for turbulence is not new@xcite . in particular",
    ", the fbm can be introduced as an alternative model for the turbulent index of refraction , and it can be shown that these processes allow to reconstruct most of the index properties@xcite .",
    "this work reports on the basic characteristics of the centroid position of a laser spot after the light has traveled through turbulent media .",
    "it is analyzed as a stochastic process , within a mathematically defined theoretical model : the fractional brownian motion .",
    "that is , given a component of the centroid position @xmath4 as a time @xmath5 function , the geometrical nature of the graph @xmath6 is studied .",
    "afterwards , the wavelet theory is used to characterize this centroid .",
    "two quantifiers are obtained : the hurst exponent , @xmath2 , and the mean normalized total wavelet entropy , @xmath3 .",
    "their behaviors are compared ; the analysis shows they describe different properties of the turbulence .",
    "the fractional brownian motion of exponent @xmath2 ( hurst exponent ) , with @xmath7 , is a zero - mean gaussian process @xmath8 with @xmath9 such that :    1 .   @xmath10 .",
    "the difference @xmath11 has finite dimensional normal distribution .",
    "this means that their increments are stationary gaussian processes whose variance is @xmath12=\\sigma^2\\left|\\delta x\\right|^{2h } , \\label{eq : fbmvariance}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is a parameter@xmath14 $ ] is , of course , the average .",
    "the nonstationary character of the fbm is evidenced by its covariance function given by @xmath15= { \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2 } } \\left\\{\\left|x\\right|^{2h}+\\left|y\\right|^{2h}-\\left|x - y\\right|^{2h}\\right\\}.   \\label{eq-1}\\ ] ] the covariance of future increments with past ones is : @xmath16                    \\nonumber \\\\                    & = & { \\sigma^2}(2^{2h-1}-1)\\left|\\delta x\\right|^{2h}.   \\label{eq-3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath17 is independet of @xmath0 and the parameter @xmath2 determine the correlation of the increments .",
    "for @xmath18 the correlation of past and future increments vanishes for all @xmath0 , as is required for an independent random process .",
    "however , for @xmath19 one has @xmath20 .",
    "for @xmath21 this quantity is positive and the process is called persistent@xcite . in this case , an increasing trend in the past implies on the average an increasing trend in the future and , conversely , a decreasing trend in the past implies on the average a continued decrease in the future . for @xmath22 the process",
    "is called antipersistent .",
    "now , an increasing trend in the past implies on the average a decreasing trend in the future , while a decreasing trend in the past makes on the average an increasing trend in the future  see fig .",
    "[ figura0 ] .",
    "k. helland and van atta@xcite were the first to study the hurst exponent in grid generated turbulence by applying a rescaled - range analysis  an usual measure of long - term persistence in geophysical time series  to turbulence velocity records measured within a wind tunel .",
    "they showed that there are some deviations from @xmath23referred as the _ hurst phenomenon_.    as a nonstationary process , the fbm does not have a spectrum defined in the usual sense ; however , it is possible to define an empirical power spectrum of the form : @xmath24 this equation is not a valid power spectrum in the theory of stationary processes since it is a nonintegrable function , but it could be considered as a generalized spectrum . through this interpretation of eq .",
    "( [ eq-4 ] ) a self - similarity relation can be shown for the fbm .",
    "that is for @xmath8 with @xmath2 and @xmath13 parameters , one has that @xmath25 have the same finite dimensional distributions for all @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the fractal dimension of sample functions of these processes is @xmath28 .",
    "first introduced by dennis gabor @xcite , wavelet analysis is a method which relies on the introduction of an appropriate basis and a characterization of the signal by the distribution of amplitude in this basis .",
    "if the basis is required to be a proper orthogonal basis , any arbitrary function can be uniquely decomposed and the decomposition can be inverted @xcite .",
    "wavelet analysis is a suitable tool for detecting and characterizing specific phenomena in time and frequency planes .",
    "the _ wavelet _ is a simple and quickly vanishing ( compactly supported ) oscillating function . unlike sine and cosine of fourier analysis , which are precisely localized in frequency but extend infinitely in time",
    ", wavelets are relatively localized in both time and frequency .",

    "@xmath29 is the set of elementary functions generated by dilations and translations of a unique admissible _ mother wavelet _",
    "@xmath30 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 are the scale and translation parameters respectively , and @xmath5 is the time . as @xmath34 increases ,",
    "the wavelet becomes narrower .",
    "thus , one have a unique analytic pattern and its replications at different scales and with variable time localization .    the _ continuous wavelet transform _ ( cwt ) of a signal @xmath35 ( the space of real square summable functions ) is defined as the correlation between the function @xmath36 with the family wavelet @xmath29 for each @xmath34 and @xmath27 : @xmath37 for special election of the mother wavelet function @xmath38 and for the discrete set of parameters , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , with @xmath41 ( the set of integers ) the family @xmath42 constitutes an orthonormal basis of the hilbert space @xmath43 consisting of finite - energy signals .",
    "the correlated _ decimated discrete wavelet transform _",
    "( dwt ) provides a nonredundant representation of the signal , and the values @xmath44 constitute the coefficients in a wavelet series .",
    "these wavelet coefficients provide relevant information in a simple way and a direct estimation of local energies at the different scales .",
    "moreover , the information can be organized in a hierarchical scheme of nested subspaces called multiresolution analysis in @xmath43 . in the present work ,",
    "we employ orthogonal cubic spline functions as mother wavelets . among several alternatives , cubic spline functions",
    "are symmetric and combine in a suitable proportion smoothness with numerical advantages .",
    "they have become a recommendable tool for representing natural signals @xcite  figure [ figura0a ] shows the cubic spline wavelet function used in this work .    in",
    "what follows , the signal is assumed to be given by the sampled values @xmath45 , corresponding to an uniform time grid with sampling time @xmath46 . for simplicity , the sampling rate is taken as @xmath47 .",
    "if the decomposition is carried out over all resolutions levels the wavelet expansion is : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and the wavelet coefficients @xmath50 can be interpreted as the local residual errors between successive signal approximations at scales @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the _ residual signal _ at scale @xmath51 .",
    "it contains the information of the signal @xmath36 corresponding to the frequencies @xmath54 with @xmath55 the sampling frequency .      since the family @xmath56 is an _",
    "basis for @xmath43 , the concept of energy is linked with the usual notions derived from fourier s theory .",
    "the wavelet coefficients are given by @xmath57 and the corresponding asociated energy will be its square . the energy at each resolution @xmath58 , will be @xmath59 where @xmath60 represents the number of wavelet coefficients at resolution @xmath51 .",
    "the total energy can be obtained in the fashion @xmath61 finally , we define the normalized @xmath62 values , which represent the _ relative wavelet energy _ ( rwe ) by @xmath63 for the resolution levels @xmath64 . the @xmath62 yield , at different scales , the probability distribution for the energy .",
    "clearly , @xmath65 and the distribution @xmath66 can be considered as a time - scale density that constitutes a suitable tool for detecting and characterizing specific phenomena in both the time and the frequency planes .",
    "the shannon entropy@xcite gives a useful criterion for analyzing and comparing probability distribution .",
    "it provides a measure of the information contained in any distribution .",
    "we define the _ normalized total wavelet entropy _ ( ntws ) @xcite as @xmath67 where @xmath68    the ntws appears to be a measure of the degree of order - disorder of the signal .",
    "it provides useful information about the underlying dynamical process associated with the signal@xcite .",
    "indeed , a very ordered process can be represented by a periodic mono - frequency signal ( signal with a narrow band spectrum ) .",
    "a wavelet representation of such a signal will be resolved at one unique wavelet resolution level , i. e. , all rwe will be ( almost ) zero except at the wavelet resolution level which includes the representative signal frequency .",
    "for this special level the rwe will be ( in our chosen energy units ) almost equal to one . as a consequence , the ntws will acquire a very small , vanishing value . a signal generated by a totally random process or chaotic",
    "one can be taken as representative of a very disordered behavior .",
    "this kind of signal will have a wavelet representation with significant contributions coming from all frequency bands .",
    "moreover , one could expect that all contributions will be of the same order .",
    "consequently , the rwe will be almost equal at all resolutions levels , and the ntws will acquire its maximum possible value .",
    "figure [ figura0b ] presents two different relative wavelet energy ( probability ) distribution corresponding to five wavelet resolution levels ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "it is clear from the figure that distribution @xmath70 presents broad band spectrum .",
    "in contrast , distribution @xmath71 shows a clear dominance of the resolution level @xmath72 . according to the description given above , for the ntws",
    "the following relations can be expected : ntws@xmath73 ntws@xmath74 .",
    "this is observed in the numerical values given at the figure .      in order to follow the temporal evolution of the quantifiers defined above , rwe and ntws ,",
    "the analyzed signal is divided into @xmath75 non - overlapping temporal windows with length @xmath76 ( @xmath77 , with @xmath78 ) .",
    "afterwards , appropriate signal - values for these quantifiers are assigned to the middle point of each time window . in the case of a diadic wavelet decomposition , the number of wavelet coefficients at resolution level @xmath51 is two times smaller than at the previous , @xmath52 , one .",
    "the minimum length of the temporal window @xmath76 will therefore include at least one wavelet coefficient at each level .",
    "the wavelet energy at resolution level @xmath51 for the time window @xmath75 is given by @xmath79 where @xmath60 represents the number of wavelet coefficients at resolution level @xmath51 corresponding to the time window @xmath75 ; while the total energy in this time window will be @xmath80 the time evolution of rwe and ntws will be given by : @xmath81 @xmath82    in order to obtain a quantifier for the whole time period under analysis @xcite the temporal average is evaluated .",
    "the temporal average of ntws is given by @xmath83 and for the wavelet energy at resolution level @xmath51 @xmath84 then the total wavelet energy temporal average is defined as @xmath85 in consequence , a mean probability distribution @xmath86 representative for the whole time interval ( the complete signal ) can be defined as @xmath87 with @xmath88 and the corresponding mean ntws as @xmath89",
    "a relevant property of the wavelet based multiresolution analysis is the stationary character of the wavelet coeficient series corresponding to each level @xmath51 of resolution@xcite .",
    "another important property is that the reconstruction of the original time series from the stationary series of wavelet coefficients reproduces the original signal with small error .    in relation with fractional brownian motion",

    "fbm is nonstationary but the wavelet coefficients are stationary at each scale@xcite ; 2 .",
    "fbm exhibits positive long - range correlation in the range @xmath90 but wavelet coefficients have a correlation which can be arbitrarily reduced ; 3 .",

    "an estimator of the parameter @xmath2 can be obtained by : _ a ) _ estimating the variance of the wavelet coefficients with eq .",

    "wavelet - based estimators dedicated to fbm can be viewed as versatile generalizations of previous techniques .",
    "an important feature of fbm is that its increments are stationary and such that the structure function is proportional to @xmath98see eq .",
    "( [ eq : fbmvariance])thus suggesting that this variance should be estimated in order to find @xmath2 . although feasible , this approach is faced with a difficulty due to long - range dependence .",
    "classical ( empirical ) variance estimators are obviously poor estimators in such a context and specific estimators have to be designed@xcite .",
    "time series corresponding to the fluctuations in the position of a laser beam s spot ( wandering ) over a screen , after propagation through laboratory generated convective turbulence , were recorded with a position sensitive detector located as screen at the end of the path .",
    "twenty records of 5000 spot beam coordinates measurements every five minutes were obtained .",
    "temperature along the laser beam path , for each record , were also measured and stored .",
    "the experimental measures were performed in the laboratory by producing convective turbulence over a path of lenght @xmath99 m with two electric heaters in a row and covering the path .",
    "we use a @xmath100mw continuous wave he - ne laser ( melles griot model 05-lhp-991 ) , wavelenght laser beam @xmath101 nm ( red ) , with pointing stability , after 15 minutes of warmup , less than @xmath102 m and a beam divergence of @xmath103mrad .",
    "each electric heater was @xmath104 cm long and @xmath105w of power .",
    "the height of the laser beam s propagation path was @xmath106 m above the electrical heaters and a box of expanded polyurethane was used as a thermal protection for the equipment .",
    "three thermometers were allocated on the top of the box , @xmath100 cm above the laser beam .",
    "they were used to determine the temperature in three positions along the propagation path , see fig .",

    "it was interfaced to a computer which allowed to measure at a rate of about @xmath105 samples per second ( @xmath108 laser spot coordinates in approximately @xmath109s ) .",
    "thus , with these coordinates stored on a hard disk the hurst exponent and the mean ntws were computed off line .",
    "three different intensity levels of convective turbulence were generated by changing the amount of heat dissipated for each electrical heater :    1 .",

    "each signal under analysis was divided in time windows of length @xmath115 and for each one the probability wavelet energy distribution was evaluated . with these values the mean wavelet energy distribution and the mean ntws , @xmath116 , were obtained .",

    "as before , the obtained values @xmath116 were averaged over the twenty records at each turbulence condition for the @xmath114-coordinates respectively .    a comparison between average hurst exponent and mean ntws is given in fig .",
    "[ figura4 ] .",
    "it is known the entropy is a measure of the order of a given system . in this case , the mean ntws shows the same behavior for both coordinates . as the turbulence increases the mean ntws does the same .",
    "but , the hurst exponent discriminates between coordinates : for the @xmath0-axis no noticeable change is observed , and for the @xmath1-axis the hurst exponent decreases ( increasing the roughness , see fig .",
    "[ figura0 ] ) with the increasing turbulence .",
    "thus , it is observed that the hurst exponent is sensitive to the mean flow of the warm air .",
    "it distinguishes the anisotropy characteristic of the convective turbulence .",
    "because the entropy measures the order obviously it does not detect the mean flow .      in relation with the hurst exponent a useful generalization",
    "consists in allowing the singularity exponent to become time - dependent @xmath117 , thus generating a new process @xmath118 such that @xmath119=\\sigma^2\\left|\\delta x\\right|^{2h(t)}. \\label{eq-1c}\\ ] ] in such a situation the increment process is no longer stationary .",
    "then , it is impossible to globally apply the technique mentioned above for estimating @xmath117 . provided that variations of @xmath117 are smooth enough ,",
    "the time series can be divided in time windows where this requirement is satisfied and for each one the similar techniques based on time - scale energy distributions can be applied locally@xcite . in any case",
    ", we must emphasize that for each one an scaling region must be defined .",
    "the time evolution of ntws could be easily implemented@xcite .",
    "moreover , the ntws is capable of detecting changes in a nonstationary signal due to the localization characteristic of the wavelet transform , the computational time is significantly shorter since the algorithm involves the use of wavelet transform in a multiresolution framework and , the ntws is parameter - free and scaling region is not necessary for its evaluation .    in the next future",
    "the intention of our project is to make experiments varying the intensity of turbulence by adjusting the voltage applied to the heating element using a voltage controller , in order to study the quantifiers temporal evolution and characterize in a quantitative way the dynamics of the process . in another hand , the same study will be doing in outdoor experiments at different moments of the day to characterize the ground atmospheric turbulence .",
