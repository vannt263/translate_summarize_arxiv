    "mathematical modelling plays an important role for understanding and predicting the spread of diseases , as well as for comparing and evaluating public health policies .",
    "although deterministic modelling can be a guide for describing epidemics , stochastic models have their importance in featuring realistic processes and in quantifying confidence in parameters estimates and prediction uncertainty @xcite .",
    "standard models in epidemiology consist in compartmental models in which the population is structured in different classes composed of susceptible , infectious , and recovered ( or removed ) individuals ( sir ) .",
    "parameter estimation for sir models is usually a difficult task because of missing observations , which is a recurrent issue in epidemiology . when the infected population is partially observed or when the infection times are missing , the computation of the likelihood is numerically infeasible because it involves integration over all the unobserved events .",
    "markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods that treat the missing data as extra parameters , have become increasingly popular for calibrating stochastic epidemiological models with missing data @xcite .",
    "however , mcmc may be computationally prohibitive for high - dimensional missing observations @xcite and fine tuning of the proposal distribution is required for efficient algorithms @xcite . in this paper , we show that sir models with missing observations can be calibrated with approximate bayesian computation ( abc ) , an alternative to mcmc , originally proposed for making inference in population genetics @xcite .",
    "this approach is not based on the likelihood function but relies on numerical simulations and comparisons between simulated and observed summary statistics .",
    "this work is motivated by the study of the cuban hiv - aids database that contains the dates of detection of the 8,662 individuals that have been found to be hiv positive in cuba between 1986 and 2007 @xcite .",
    "the database contains additional covariates including the manner by which an individual has been found to be hiv positive .",
    "the individuals can be detected either by _ random screening _",
    "( individuals ` spontaneously ' take a detection test ) or _ contact - tracing_. contact - tracing consists in testing the sexual contacts of detected individuals @xcite .",
    "the total number of infectious individuals as well as the infection times are unknown .    in section [ sectionsir ]",
    ", we introduce the stochastic sir model with contact - tracing developed by @xcite .",
    "section [ sectionabc ] is devoted to abc methods when all detection times are known .",
    "we propose an original extension of abc to path - valued summary statistics consisting of the cumulated number of detections through time .",
    "for a simple sir model , we compare numerically the posterior distributions obtained with abc and mcmc .",
    "section 4 deals with possibly noisy or binned detection times for which the previous path - valued statistics are unavailable .",
    "we introduce a finite dimensional vector of summary statistics and compare the statistical properties of point estimates and credibility intervals obtained with full and binned detection times .",
    "finally , section [ sectioncuba ] concentrates on the analysis of the cuban hiv - aids database .",
    "we address several questions concerning the dynamic of this epidemic : what is the percentage of the epidemic that is known @xcite ; how many new cases of hiv are expected in the forthcoming years ; and what is the proportion of detections that is expected in the contact - tracing program .",
    "we restrict our study to the sexually - transmitted epidemic of hiv in cuba ( 90% of the epidemic , see @xcite ) . for modelling the dynamics of the number of known and unknown hiv cases , we consider a sir model developed by @xcite .",
    "the population is divided into three main classes @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 corresponding to the _ susceptible _ , _ infectious _ , and _ detected _ individuals considered as _ removed _ because we assume that they do not transmit hiv anymore ( see figure [ fig : sir ] ) . the population of the susceptible individuals , of size @xmath4 , at time @xmath5 , consists of the sexually active seronegative individuals .",
    "individuals immigrate into the class @xmath1 with a rate @xmath6 and leave it by dying / emigrating , with rate @xmath7 , or by becoming infected .",
    "the class of infectious individuals , of size @xmath8 , corresponds to the seropositive individuals who have not taken a detection test yet and may thus contaminate new susceptible individuals .",
    "we assume that each infected individual may transmit the disease to a susceptible individual at rate @xmath9 so that the total rate of infection is equal to @xmath10 .",
    "individuals leave the class @xmath2 when they die / emigrate with a total rate of @xmath11 , or when they are detected to be hiv positive .    the class @xmath3 of the detected individuals , of size @xmath12 , is subdivided into two subclasses .",
    "we denote by @xmath13 ( resp .",
    "@xmath14 ) the size of the removed population detected by random screening ( resp .",
    "contact - tracing ) .",
    "the total rate of detection by random screening is @xmath15 . for the rate of contact - tracing detection",
    ", the model shall capture the fact that the contribution of a removed individual depends on the time elapsed since she / he has been found to be hiv positive .",
    "we consider the two following expressions for the total rate of contact - tracing detection @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the time at which a removed individual @xmath18 has been detected .",
    "the weight @xmath19 , with @xmath20 , determines the contribution of a removed individual @xmath18 to the contact - tracing according to the time @xmath21 she / he has been detected . the first rate in ( [ formlambda3 ] ) corresponds to a mass action principle , and is proportional to the sum of the contributions of the detected individuals . the second rate in ( [ formlambda3 ]",
    ") corresponds to a model with frequency dependence . in the following",
    ", @xmath22 denotes the multivariate parameter of the model .",
    "the parameters of interest are here @xmath9 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .      here",
    "we consider the first rate of contact - tracing detection in ( [ formlambda3 ] ) , but similar results can be obtained for the second rate .",
    "@xcite showed that in a large population limit , the sir process of section [ sectionsir ] can be modelled with stochastic differential equations and converges to the solution of the following system of ordinary differential equations @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the size of the susceptible and infectious populations , and where @xmath28 is the contribution of the removed individuals to the contact - tracing ( see section 1 of the supplementary material for more details ) .",
    "apart from the inherent stochastic nature of epidemic propagation that may be particularly important for small populations @xcite , considering a stochastic sir model rather than its deterministic counterpart can present at least two important advantages .",
    "first , it is quite straightforward to perform simulations from the stochastic model ( see section 2 of the supplementary material ) and this is one motivation for considering abc methods .",
    "second , the individual - centered stochastic process suits the formalism of statistical methods , which are based on samples of individual data .",
    "since the estimates of the stochastic process converge to the parameters of the odes @xcite , abc provides a new alternative for calibrating parameters of odes @xcite .",
    "for simplicity , we deal here with densities and not general probability measures .",
    "let @xmath29 be the available data and @xmath30 be the prior .",
    "two approximations are at the core of abc .",
    "+ * replacing observations with summary statistics * instead of focusing on the posterior density @xmath31 , abc aims at a possibly less informative _ target _ density @xmath32 where @xmath1 is a summary statistic that takes its values in a normed space , and @xmath33 denotes the observed summary statistic . the summary statistic @xmath1 can be a @xmath34-dimensional vector or an infinite - dimensional variable such as a @xmath35 function",
    "of course , if @xmath1 is sufficient , then the two conditional densities are the same .",
    "the target distribution will also be coined as the _ partial posterior distribution_. + * simulation - based approximations of the posterior * once the summary statistics have been chosen , the second approximation arises when estimating the partial posterior density @xmath36 and sampling from this distribution .",
    "this step involves nonparametric kernel estimation and possibly correction refinements given in section [ sec : correction ] .",
    "the abc method with smooth rejection generates random draws from the target distribution as follows @xcite    1 .",
    "generate @xmath37 random draws @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "the parameter @xmath40 is generated from the prior distribution @xmath41 and the vector of summary statistics @xmath42 is calculated for the @xmath43 data set that is simulated from the generative model with parameter @xmath40 .",
    "associate to the @xmath43 simulation the weight @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a tolerance threshold and @xmath46 a ( possibly multivariate ) smoothing kernel .",
    "the distribution @xmath47 , in which @xmath48 denotes the dirac mass at @xmath49 , approximates the target distribution .",
    "once a sample from the target distribution has been obtained , several estimators may be considered for point estimation of each one - dimensional parameter @xmath50 , @xmath51 . using the weighted sample @xmath52 , @xmath53 , the _",
    "mean _ of the target distribution @xmath54 is estimated by @xmath55 which is the well - known nadaraya - watson regression estimator of the conditional expectation @xmath56 .",
    "we also compute the _ medians _",
    ", _ modes _ , and @xmath57 credibility intervals ( ci ) of the marginal posterior distribution ( see section 3 of the supplementary material ) .      *",
    "data * starting at the time of the first detection in 1986 , the cuban hiv - aids data consist principally of the detection times at which the individuals have been found to be hiv positive . at the time of the last detection event , in july 2007 , there is a total of 8,662 individuals in the database . for each detection event",
    ", there is a label indicating if the individual has been detected by random screening or contact - tracing . + * summary statistics * we consider the two ( infinite - dimensional ) statistics @xmath58)$ ] and @xmath59)$ ] .",
    "their sum is equal to the cumulated number of detections since the beginning of the epidemic . because the data consist of the detection times for the two different types of detection",
    ", these two statistics can simply be viewed as a particular coding of the whole dataset so that the partial posterior distribution @xmath60 is equal to the posterior distribution @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath35-norm between the @xmath61 simulated path @xmath62 and the observed one @xmath63 is @xmath64 for computing the weights @xmath65 , we choose a product kernel so that @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 are 2 tolerance thresholds .",
    "epanechnikov kernels are considered for @xmath69 and @xmath70 and @xmath67 and @xmath68 are found by accepting a given percentage @xmath71 of the simulations .",
    "following @xcite a performance indicator for abc techniques consists in their ability to replicate likelihood - based results given by mcmc . here",
    "the situation is particularly favorable for comparing the two methods since the partial and the full posterior are the same . in the following examples ,",
    "we choose samples of small sizes ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) so that the dimension of the missing data is reasonable and mcmc achieves fast convergence . for large sample sizes with high - dimensional missing data ,",
    "mcmc convergence might indeed be a serious issue and more thorough updating scheme shall be implemented @xcite .",
    "we consider the standard sir model with no contact - tracing ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "we choose gamma distributions for the priors of @xmath9 and @xmath23 with a shape parameters of @xmath75 and rate parameters of @xmath76 and @xmath75 .",
    "the data consist of the detection times and we assume that the infection times are not observed .",
    "we implement the mcmc algorithm of @xcite .",
    "a total of @xmath77 steps are considered for mcmc with an initial burn - in of @xmath78 steps . for abc , the summary statistic consists of the cumulative number of detections as a function of time .",
    "a total of @xmath79 simulations are performed for abc .    the first example was previously considered by @xcite .",
    "they simulated detection times by considering one initial infectious individual and by setting @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 ( see section 4 of the supplementary material for the data ) .",
    "as displayed by figure [ fig:3obs ] , the posterior distributions obtained with abc are extremely close to the ones obtained with mcmc provided that the tolerance rate is sufficiently small .",
    "we see that the tolerance rate changes importantly the posterior distribution obtained with abc ( see the posterior distributions for @xmath23 ) .    in a second example",
    ", we simulate a standard sir trajectory with @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the data now consist of 29 detection times ( see section 4 of the supplementary material ) . once again",
    ", figure [ fig:3obs ] shows that the abc and mcmc posteriors are close provided that the tolerance rate is small enough .",
    "abc produces posterior distributions with larger tails compared to mcmc , even with the lowest tolerance rate of @xmath85 .",
    "this can be explained by considering the extreme scenario in which the tolerance threshold @xmath45 goes to infinity : every simulation has a weight of 1 so that abc targets the prior instead of the posterior .",
    "as the prior has typically larger tails than the posterior , abc inflates the posterior tails .",
    "when there is noise or when the detection times have been binned , the full observations @xmath58)$ ] and @xmath59)$ ] are unavailable . then , we replace these summary statistics by a vector of summary statistics such as the numbers of detections per year during the observation period",
    ". since these new summary statistics are not sufficient anymore , the new partial posterior distribution may be different from the posterior @xmath86 . in the following , we compare point estimates and cis obtained from abc with full ( method of section [ sectionabc ] ) and binned detection times ( method of section [ sec : correction ] ) .",
    "we consider a d - dimensional vector of summary statistics of three different types .",
    "first , we compute the numbers @xmath87 and @xmath88 of individuals detected by random screening and contact - tracing by the end of the observation period .",
    "second , for each year @xmath89 , we compute the numbers of individuals that have been found to be hiv positive @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "the third type of summary statistics consists of the numbers of new infectious for each of the the sixth first years @xmath92 for @xmath93 , as well as the mean time during which an individual is infected but has not been detected yet .",
    "this mean time corresponds to the mean sojourn time in the class i for the sixth first years .",
    "these summary statistics are available here because infectious times before 1992 are known .    in order to compute the weights @xmath65 , we consider the following spherical kernel @xmath94 . here",
    "@xmath95 denotes the one - dimensional epanechnikov kernel , @xmath96 is the euclidian norm of @xmath97 and @xmath98 a matrix .",
    "because the summary statistics may span different scales , @xmath99 is taken equal to the diagonal matrix with the standard deviation of each one - dimensional summary statistic on the diagonal .      in the case of a @xmath34-dimensional vector of summary statistics , the estimator of the conditional mean ( [ estimateurbayesien ] ) is convergent if the tolerance rate satisfies @xmath100 , so that its bias converges to 0 , and @xmath101 , so that its variance converges to 0 @xcite .",
    "as @xmath34 increases , a larger tolerance threshold shall be chosen to keep the variance small . as a consequence ,",
    "the bias may increase with the number of summary statistics .",
    "this phenomenon known as the _ curse of dimensionality _ may be an issue for the abc - rejection approach .",

    "the adjustment principle is presented in a general setting within which the corrections of @xcite and @xcite can be derived .",
    "correction adjustments aim at obtaining from a random couple @xmath38 a random variable distributed according to @xmath102 .",

    "the per capita rate of contact - tracing equals @xmath198 . using a zero - order expansion , we find that this rate can be approximated by the product of @xmath24 with the coverage of the epidemic .",
    "hence , the per capita rate of contact - tracing can be estimated as @xmath199 that is almost equal to @xmath23 . +",
    "* predictions * additionally , simulations of the sir model provide predictions for the evolution of the hiv dynamic in the forthcoming years .",
    "the sir model predicts that in 2015 , @xmath200 ( @xmath201 $ ] ) individuals will be infected since the beginning of the epidemic in cuba . among these infected individuals ,",
    "a proportion of @xmath202 ( @xmath203 $ ] ) will be detected by random screening and a proportion of @xmath204 ( @xmath205 $ ] ) by contact - tracing . as displayed by figure",
    "[ fig : pred ] , the sir - type model with contact - tracing predicts that the total proportion of individuals detected by contact - tracing will reach an asymptote of @xmath206 ( @xmath207 $ ] ) in 2015 .",
    "the total number of infected individuals in 2015 corresponds to @xmath208 ( @xmath209 $ ] ) new cases of hiv between july 2007 and january 2015 . in the same period of time",
    ", the sir model predicts that @xmath210 individuals ( @xmath211 $ ] ) will be detected by random screening and @xmath212 individuals ( @xmath213 $ ] ) by contact - tracing .",
    "in the context of temporal epidemiological data , abc techniques can provide accurate estimates of the parameters of interest such as the infection and detection rates @xcite .",
    "abc relies on simulations of the model and can therefore be applied to various epidemiological models .    for partially observed population and missing infectious times ,",
    "mcmc methods require to reconstruct the unknown data which can be highly computationally intensive for large populations .",
    "for instance , @xcite and @xcite considered mcmc algorithms for populations consisting of about 100 individuals whereas the cuban hiv - aids database contains almost 10,000 known hiv positive individuals , which makes the total ( known and unknown ) number of infectious individuals even larger .",
    "when the dimension of the missing data , the infection times here , is both large and unknown , data imputation with mcmc can be computationally very demanding and takes several days on a parallelized system @xcite .",
    "however , compared with the abundant mcmc literature , the experience of statisticians with abc is still rather limited . for mcmc algorithms ,",
    "theoretical convergence results @xcite as well as practical methods for monitoring numerical convergence are available @xcite .",
    "although theoretical results are now available for abc @xcite , there is no method for evaluating the two approximations inherent to abc ( section [ sectionmainpple ] ) . here , we are in a favorable situation since the full summary statistics are sufficient so that the partial and the full posterior are the same . however , for the second approximation , the practice of conditional density estimation in high dimensions remains an issue .",
    "when comparing posterior distributions obtained with mcmc and abc for a standard sir model , we find the same modes provided that the tolerance rate is small enough .",
    "however , even for the smallest tolerance rate , we find that abc generates posterior distributions with larger tails compared with mcmc . more generally , abc applications have been restricted to models with moderate number of parameters whereas mcmc applications can involve a very large number of parameters ( @xcite ) . for models with a substantial numbers of parameters , adaptive abc algorithms that use the simulations to modify the sampling distribution of the parameter @xmath49 , might constitute interesting ways to explore for the future of abc in epidemiology @xcite .    in this paper , we consider both finite and infinite dimensional summary statistics for abc . when comparing abc with the two different sets of statistics , we find that the point estimates of the parameters @xmath9 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , with the smallest quadratic errors are obtained with the rejection method based on the infinite - dimensional statistics .",
    "however , the @xmath57 cis obtained with this method are large and critically depend on the tolerance rate . by contrast ,",
    "regression - based adjustment methods , and the nch method more particularly , considerably shorten the cis and are less sensitive to the tolerance rate .",
    "applications of regression - based abc methods constitute therefore a solution for ` stabilizing ' the cis .",
    "however , no abc with regression adjustment have been developed so far for infinite - dimensional summary statistics .    in the last section of the paper ,",
    "we calibrate the sir model to the cuban hiv - aids data . by comparing the posterior predictive distributions of the total number of detections , we find that the model with a frequency - dependent rate of contact - tracing provides the best fit to the data .",
    "using this model , we compare the present - day rates of contact - tracing and random screening .",
    "we find that they are almost the same and equal to @xmath214/individual / year .",
    "converting rates of detection to waiting times before detections , we find that the waiting time before an individual infected today will be detected is equal to @xmath215 years . at the time of detection , both types of detection are equally probable .",
    "although it suggests that contact - tracing detection contributes importantly to hiv screening in cuba , we find that the screening might have been largely incomplete .",
    "the percentage of undetected individuals among the infectious individuals might have been underestimated @xcite and would be of the order of @xmath0 .",
