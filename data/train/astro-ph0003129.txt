    "in cosmology the standard picture of gravitational growth , and also many aspects of fundamental physics , are extrapolated many orders of magnitude , from the scales and times where our current theory of gravity ( general relativity , gr ) has been experimentally tested , into the distant universe . in particular ,",
    "current limits on the ( parametrized ) post newtonian formalism mostly restrict to our very local universe ( see will 1993 ) .",
    "it is important to evaluate how much our predictions and cosmological picture depend on the underlying hypothesis ( see peebles 1999 for insightful comments on the state of this subject ) .",
    "the other side of this argument is that cosmology can be used to test fundamental physics , such as our theory of gravity .",
    "one aspect of gr that could be questioned or tested without modifying the basic structure or symmetry of the theory are einstein s field equations , relating the energy content ( @xmath7 ) to the curvature ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "one such modification , which will be considered here , is scalar - tensor theories ( stt ) , such as brans - dicke ( bd ) theory .",
    "a more generic , but also more vague , way of testing the importance of einstein s field equations is to model independently the geometry and the matter content , thus allowing for the possibility of other relations between them .",
    "some simple aspects of this idea will be illustrated here by studying structure formation in a flat , matter dominated universe but with a more general growth law for the hubble rate see section [ sec32 ] below . similarly , we will also consider results for a generic equation of state : @xmath9 , where @xmath3 can be chosen independently of the cosmological parameters ( @xmath4 , @xmath10 and @xmath5 ) .",
    "our aim in this paper is to explore certain variations of the standard model to see how they affect structure formation .",
    "the idea is to find a way to parameterize variations from gr that might produce differences large enough to be observable .",
    "the variations considered could have other observable consequences ( eg in the local universe or in the radiation dominated regime ) which might rule them out as a viable new theory .",
    "but even if this were the case , we still would have learn something about how structure formation depends on the underlying theory of gravity or the assumptions about the equation of state .",
    "this aspect of the theory has hardly been explored and it therefore represents an important step forward in analyzing alternatives to the current paradigm , eg non - baryonic matter ( see peebles 1999 ) , and could also help to set limits on variations of gr or the equation of state at high red - shifts .    here",
    "we consider two main regimes for structure formation in non - standard gravity / cosmology : weakly non - linear and strongly non - linear large scale clustering .",
    "we study the shear - free or spherical collapse ( sc ) model , which corresponds to the spherically symmetric ( or local ) dynamics ( see below ) .",
    "this approximation works very well at least in two different contexts , that will be explored here .",
    "the first one is the growth of the smoothed 1-point cumulants of the probability distribution for large scale density fluctuations : the sc model turns out to reproduce exactly the leading order perturbation theory predictions ( bernardeau 1992 ) , and turns out to be an excellent approximation for the exact dynamics as compared to n - body simulations both with gaussian ( fosalba & gaztaaga 1998a , 1998b ) and non - gaussian initial conditions ( gaztaaga & fosalba 1998 ) .",
    "the measured 1-point cumulants in galaxy catalogues have been compared with these predictions ( eg bouchet 1993 , gaztaaga 1992,1994 , gaztaaga & frieman 1994 , baugh , gaztaaga & efstathiou 1995 , gaztaaga 1995 , baugh & gaztaaga 1996 , colombi etal 1997 , hui & gaztaaga 1999 ) .",
    "the second one is the study of the epoch of formation and abundance of structures ( such as galaxies and clusters ) , using the press & schechter ( 1974 ) formalism and its extensions ( eg bond 1991 , lacey & cole 1993 , sheth & lemson 1999 , scoccimarro 2000 ) .",
    "given some gaussian initial conditions , this formalism can predict the number of structures ( halos ) of a given mass that will form at each stage of the evolution .",
    "one can use the sc model to predict the value of the critical linear over - density , @xmath11 , that will collapse into virialized halos .",
    "it turns out that the analytical predictions for the halo mass function and formation rates are remarkably accurate as compared to n - body simulations ( lacey & cole 1994 ) .",
    "one can also use this type of modeling to predict clustering properties of halos ( eg mo & white 1996 , mo , jing & white 1997 ) , cluster abundances ( white , efstathiou & frenk 1993 , bahcall & fan 1998 ) or weak lensing through mass functions ( jain & van waerbeke 2000 ) .",
    "the observed cluster abundances have been used as a strong discriminant for cosmological models and also as a way to measure the amplitude of mass fluctuations , @xmath12 ( see white , efstathiou & frenk 1993 , bahcall & fan 1998 ) .    in summary , we propose to address a very specific question here : how different are the above non - linear predictions when using a non - standard cosmology and non - standard theory of gravity ? to answer this question we will consider two non - standard variations : scalar - tensor models and some examples of a cosmology that do not obey einstein s field equations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  2 we give a summary on how non - linear structure formation relates to the underlying theory of gravity ( see weinberg 1972 , peebles 1993 , ellis 1999 and references therein , for a review on the relation between gravitational theory and cosmology ) .",
    "this section covers old ground with some detail as an introduction to later sections and for the reader that is not familiar with this subject or notation .",
    "we also present the more general case of an ideal ( relativistic ) fluid . as far as we know , some of the non - linear results presented here are new . in ",
    "3 we show how these predictions change in the two examples of non - standard gravity .",
    "observational consequences are explored in  4 . in  5 we present a discussion and the conclusions .",
    "the self - gravity of an over - dense region work against the expansion of the universe so that this region will expand at a slower rate that the background .",
    "this increases the density contrast so that eventually the region collapses .",
    "the details of this collapse depends on the initial density profile . here",
    "we will focus in the spherically symmetric case .",
    "we will revise non - linear structure growth in the context of the fluid limit and the shear - free approximation .",
    "these turns out to be very good approximation for the applications that will be considered later ( leading order and strongly non - linear statistics ) .",
    "we start with the raychaudhuri s equation , which is valid for an arbitrary ricci tensor @xmath8 .",
    "we use einstein s field equations and the continuity equation to turn raychaudhuri s equation into a second order differential equation for the density contrast .",
    "we first present the matter dominated ( non - relativistic ) case , with solutions for the linear and non - linear regimes .",
    "later , in   [ sec : eqofstate ] , we assess the more generic case of an ideal ( relativistic ) fluid and its corresponding solution .",
    "we start recalling that the metric tensor @xmath13 defines the line element of space - time :    ds^2 =  g _",
    "dx^  dx^which in the homogeneous and isotropic model of the cosmological principle can be written as ( see eg weinberg 1972 ) :    ds^2 = dt^2 - a^2(t )  [ frw ]    as usual we will work in comoving coordinates @xmath14 related to physical coordinates by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the cosmic scale factor , and @xmath17 the corresponding red - shift ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "thus all geometrical aspects of this universal line element are determined up to the function @xmath19 and the arbitrary constant @xmath20 , which defines the usual open , einstein - desitter and closed universes .",
    "the function @xmath19 can be found for each energy content by solving the corresponding equations of motion , eg the gravitational field equations .    in this section",

    "as one would expect , this yields a _",
    "local _ evolution , in the sense that the evolved field at a point is just given by a local ( non - linear ) transformation of the initial field at the same point , with independence of the surroundings .",

    "one would also expect some level of degeneracy with biasing and initial conditions for cluster abundances or formation times ( see robinson , gawiser & silk 1998 , willick 1999 ) .    rather than proposing an alternative theory of gravity or cosmological model , the aim of this paper was to show that some small deviations from the current paradigm have significant and measurable consequences for non - linear structure formation . this could eventually help explaining some of the current puzzles confronting the theory , such as the need of non - baryonic dark matter . alternatively ,",
    "current and upcoming observations of non - linear clustering and mass functions can be used to explore our assumptions and place limits on the theory of gravity at large ( @xmath241 ) scales .",
    "this provides an interesting test for gravity as the driving force for structure formation and for our knowledge of the cosmological equation of state .",
    "a more comprehensive comparison with particular scenarios is left for future work .",
