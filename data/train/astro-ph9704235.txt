    "intrinsic qso absorption lines include the broad absorption lines ( bals ) , at least some of the much narrower associated ( ) lines , and any other ( ) systems that form near the qso engine .",
    "we are involved in a program to identify these systems and study their kinematics , ionization and metal abundances using spectra from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and the keck and lick observatories .",
    "some results on the identifications and kinematics are discussed in the accompanying paper by hamann in this volume ( hereafter paper1 ) .",
    "the combined uv ( _ hst _ ) and visible ( ground - based ) spectra allow us to ( 1 ) measure lines across a wide range of ionizations and ( 2 ) derive reliable column densities from the relatively low - resolution hst spectra .",
    "we are particularly interested in the o  vi  1032,1037 and ne  viii  770,780 doublets to probe the high - ionization gas and test the possible relationship ( mathur 1994 ; also mathur and shields & hamann this volume ) between the uv - line and x - ray warm absorbing regions .",
    "warm absorbers can be identified by bound - free absorption edges of o  vii and/or o  viii at @xmath00.8 kev .",
    "measurements of the ne  viii column density can directly constrain the amount of warm absorber material because o  vii and o  viii are the dominant species of oxygen in the ne  viii absorbing gas ( see below ) .",
    "we now have two firm detections of the ne  viii doublet .",
    "both are in  systems of redshift @xmath02 qsos : pks  0119@xmath3046 and um  675 .",
    "all of the strong  lines in pks  0119@xmath3046 , including the ne  viii pair , appear to be saturated and therefore do not provide accurate column densities .",
    "the results for um  675 are more reliable .",
    "figure 1 shows the _",
    "hst_-fos spectrum of this source ( junkkarinen 1997 ) .",
    "much higher resolution keck observatory spectra across the , c  iv and n  v lines are shown in paper1 and hamann ( 1997 ) .",
    "table 1 lists the derived column densities ( @xmath4 in ) for each of the  lines .",
    "the column densities are from hamann ( 1995 ) except that the metallic columns are increased by a factor of 2 to be consistent with the 50% coverage fraction derived for the c  iv and n  v absorbers ( paper1 ; hamann 1997 ) .",

    "the h  i fraction , @xmath24(h  i ) , is shown across the top of the figure .",
    "the calculations were performed using cloudy ( version 90.02 , ferland 1997 ) with an ionizing spectrum that is believed to be typical of qsos and seyfert 1 nuclei ( from mathews & ferland 1987 , with an additional decline at wavelengths @xmath282 ) .",
    "the results do not depend on the column densities as long as the clouds are optically thin in the h  i lyman continuum , as is implied by the measured column densities in most  and bal systems  including um  675 ( hamann 1997 ) .    comparing the measurements in table 1 to the calculations in figure 2",
    "shows that there is a range of ionization states in the um  675 absorber .",
    "the column density ratios of c  iii / c  iv and n  iii / n  v yield an abundance - independent estimate of @xmath29 , while the ratio o  vi / ne  viii implies @xmath30 ( with the reasonable assumption that the o / ne abundance ratio is solar ) .",
    "this range of ionization states requires that the clouds span factors of @xmath0250 in density , @xmath016 in distance from the ionizing qso , or some equivalent combination thereof .",
    "figure 2 also shows that we can estimate the column density in o  vii+o  viii from @xmath5(ne  viii ) by the relation , @xmath31 where ne / o is the abundance ratio and @xmath24(ne  viii)/@xmath24(o  vii+o  viii ) is an ionization correction . for solar ne / o and a conservatively large ionization correction factor of 10 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , we find @xmath5(o  vii+o  viii )  @xmath32  , which implies bound - free optical depths at the o  vii and o  viii edges of 0.08 and 0.04 , respectively .",
    "we conclude that there is highly ionized warm - absorber - like gas in the uv line forming region of um  675 , but there is not enough of that gas to actually be a warm absorber . with h. netzer and j. shields",
    ", we are now pursuing simultaneous observations of the ne  viii lines and o  vii+o  viii edges in other qsos to test the uv line  x - ray warm absorber connection further .",
    "the normalized abundance of any metal relative to hydrogen is given by , @xmath33 \\ = \\ \\",

    "\\log\\left({{f({\\rm hi})}\\over{f({\\rm m}_i)}}\\right ) \\ + \\",
    "\\log\\left({{{\\rm h}}\\over{\\rm m}}\\right)_{\\odot}\\ ] ] where ( h / m)@xmath34 is the solar abundance ratio .",
    "if the gas is in photoionization equilibrium and optically thin at all far - uv continuum wavelengths , the ionization correction factors , @xmath24(hi)/@xmath24(m@xmath6 ) , depend only on @xmath27 and the shape of the ionizing spectrum .",
    "column density measurements for a variety of ions can constrain @xmath27 and the correction factors needed for [ m / h ] by comparison to figure 2 .",
    "further comparisons to calculations using other spectral shapes can define the uncertainties ( see hamann 1997 ) .    for systems with a range of ionization states ( e.g. um  675 ) or no useful constraints on @xmath27",
    ", we can derive conservatively low values of @xmath24(hi)/@xmath24(m@xmath6 ) and therefore [ m / h ] by assuming that each metal line forms where that ion is most abundant , i.e. at an ionization corresponding to the peak of its @xmath24(m@xmath6 ) curve in figure 2 .",
    "we can also place firm lower limits on the [ m / h ] ratios by adopting the minimum ionization corrections for each m@xmath6 .",
    "every correction factor reaches a minimum value at @xmath27 values slightly larger than the peak in the @xmath24(m@xmath6 ) curve .",
    "figure 3 shows two examples of the minimum correction factors for a range of ionizing spectral shapes ( from hamann 1997 ) .",
    "the spectra used for these calculations are segmented power laws with fixed slopes ( @xmath35 ) of @xmath36 in the visible and @xmath31.0 in x - rays above 0.7 kev .",
    "we explore a range of continuum shapes by varying @xmath37 , which relates the flux densities ( @xmath38 ) at 2500    and 2  kev , and @xmath39 , which marks the cutoff energy where the visible power law gives way to a steeper decline toward the x - ray flux at 0.7 kev .",
    "( this is continuum ` c ' in hamann 1997 . )",
    "the mathews & ferland ( 1987 ) continuum used in figure 2 can be approximated by @xmath40 and @xmath41  ( ev )  @xmath42 .",
    "the last two columns in table 1 apply these calculations to the  absorber in um  675 and to a set of mean column densities derived for bals ( hamann 1997 ) .",
    "[ m / h]@xmath7 are the conservatively low abundance ratios that follow from the assumption that each metal line forms at the peak in its @xmath24(m@xmath6 ) curve .",
    "[ m / h]@xmath8 are the lower limits derived from the minimum correction factors in figure 3 ( also hamann 1997 ) .",
    "the uncertainties listed in the table indicate the range of values derived for a range of continuum shapes .",
    "both [ m / h ] quantities are typically higher ( and more realistic ) for low - ionization metals because the h  i lines tend to form with these ions .",
    "the [ m / h]@xmath7 results provide our best guess at the actual abundances in um  675 ; the overall metallicity is roughly twice solar ( @xmath43  ) based on [ c / h ] , with nitrogen several times more enhanced .",
    "the average bal column densities indicate that they typically have much higher metallicities of @xmath44   based on [ si / h ] .",
    "however , that result and the extremely high p / c ratios reported for some bals ( turnshek 1996 and this volume ; korista 1996 ; junkkarinen this volume ) are uncertain because the column densities depend on the unknown coverage fractions of the absorbers ( also paper1 and arav this volume ) . nonetheless , the main result for @xmath1  does appear secure and typical of all types of intrinsic absorbers ( also petitjean , rauch & carswell 1994 ; hamann 1997 ) .",
    "there is also independent evidence for @xmath1  in qsos from the broad emission lines ( hamann & ferland 1993 ; ferland 1996 ) .",
    "this growing evidence for high abundances in qsos supports standard models of galaxy evolution ; vigorous star formation in the spheroidal cores of massive galaxies should produce super - solar gas - phase metallicities within a few billion years of the initial collapse .",
    "high metal abundances are a signature of _ massive _ galaxies because only they can retain their gas long enough against the building thermal pressures from supernova explosions .",
    "the enriched gas might ultimately be ejected from the galaxy , consumed by the black hole , or diluted by subsequent infall , but the evidence for early - epoch high-@xmath45 gas remains in the stars today .",
    "in particular , the mean stellar metallicities in the cores of nearby massive galaxies are typically @xmath01 to 3  .",
    "the individual stars are distributed about these means with metallicities reflecting the gas - phase abundance at the time of their formation . only the most recently formed stars at any epoch have metallicities as high as that in the gas .",
    "standard chemical evolution models indicate that the gas - phase abundances in galactic nuclei are @xmath02 to 3 times larger than the stellar means , e.g. @xmath02 to 9  near the end of the star - forming epoch ( see hamann & ferland 1993 , hamann 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , metallicities in the range @xmath46   can be _ expected _ in qsos as long as ( 1 ) the gas we observe was processed by stars in the cores of massive ( @xmath4710@xmath48  ) galaxies ( or at least in dense condensations that become the cores of massive galaxies ) , and ( 2 ) most of the star formation and enrichment occurs before the qsos `` turn on '' or become observable .",
