    "quantum information processing ( qip ) often needs to transfer a quantum state from one site to another @xcite . for example , in optical quantum communications , one may directly transmit flying photons .",
    "however , in many other tasks , e.g. , solid - state - based quantum computation , quantum state transmission is not a trivial task .",
    "completing such a task is often needed in qip , e.g. , the quantum information exchange between two separate processors .",
    "therefore , it is very important to find physical systems that provide robust quantum state transmission lines linking different qip processors .    in recent years",
    ", extensive investigations have been done on quantum state transfer .",
    "in particular , many results have been obtained on qubit - state transfer through spin chains with various types of neighbor couplings .",
    "the original idea of quantum state transfer through a system of interacting spins-1/2 was introduced by bose @xcite .",
    "afterward , chirstandl _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and independently nikolopoulos _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite found that perfect state transfer ( pst ) is possible  @xcite in spin-1/2 networks without any additional actions from senders and receivers , including not requiring switching on and off qubit couplings .",
    "these results have triggered much interest in demonstrating and optimizing reliable state transfer in different models of interacting spin chains ( see e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for example , di franco _ et al . _",
    "@xcite clarified that pst can be realized in spin-1/2 chains with neither state initialization of the medium nor fine - tuned control pulses .",
    "recently , this scheme @xcite was further simplified  @xcite by not using remote collaboration of senders and receivers .",
    "thus , the pst of qubit states only requires access to two spins at each end of the spin-1/2 chain .",
    "-variable function @xmath0 from processor a to processor b through a bosonic chain initially in an _ arbitrary _ state.,width=8 ]    here , we show how to achieve pst of _ any function _ through bosonic lattices .",
    "earlier schemes often assume that all the spins ( besides the edge spins ) are in the ground state . here",
    ", we do not assume this .",
    "so far , only a few works  @xcite investigated the perfect transmission of an arbitrary _ continuous_-variable quantum state . as it is well known , many important quantum states belong to this class , e.g. , squeezed and coherent states .",
    "also it is possible to make qip with such states for many important tasks . here",
    ", we propose a protocol to perfectly transfer an unknown @xmath1-variable function from a processor at one end of a boson chain to another processor at the other end ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in the former schemes , _ exponential_-type states ( e.g. , coherent or squeezed states ) can not be perfectly transferred through spin networks .",
    "it is important to emphasize that our proposal _ can _ do this . by using continuous - variable states ,",
    "our protocol can be designed directly , since there is a one - to - one correspondence between continuous variables and bosonic operators .",
    "the interaction required for perfect state transfer in our model can be implemented using the bose - hubbard model  a paradigm for studying correlated bosonic systems , such as optical lattices , josephson junction arrays , topological excitations , and so on ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we stress that there is a family of hamiltonians that can perform the same tasks .",
    "we derive this family via the so - called _ dressing _ transformations , which will be described below .",
    "moreover , we show that the state transfer between two sites in two - dimensional lattices can produce quantum interference that can be characterized by the signature factor used in nuclear theory spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "let us now consider dynamics of bosons , in a system with @xmath2 sites , governed by the bose - hubbard hamiltonian  @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the number operator for the bosons located at the @xmath5th site , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the bosonic creation ( annihilation ) operator . for simplicity ,",

    "also ultrahigh - finesse toroidal fiber - coupled microresonators have been proposed @xcite , for which the observed coupling between fundamental modes of a fiber and a microresonator much exceeds losses into other modes : specifically , the experimental ideality factor was reported to be 99.97% @xcite .",

    "see @xcite .",
    "we note that , in the latter systems , it is more difficult , in comparison to coupled arrays of cavities , to access and to control individual lattice sites due to the small distances between the sites @xcite .",
    "we note that when the nonlinear term @xmath24 in eq .",

    "1 ) should not be necessarily in the ground state and can be in an arbitrary state .",
    "however , for simplicity and without loss of generality , here , we work with the state @xmath78 .",
    "when the strength of @xmath24 is relatively strong and the total number @xmath79 is much smaller than the number , @xmath2 , of sites , the system tends to have at most one atom at each site because of the gap caused by @xmath80 moreover , in the limit when there is only one boson , we can still transfer a function perfectly . in this case ,",
    "an arbitrary state @xmath81 of the whole system can be annihilated by the on - site repulsion hamiltonian @xmath82 therefore , this case is the same as the one in eq .",
    ". the transfer would be perfect if we are able to prepare an initial state @xmath83 where only the first site is occupied .",
    "thus , the state can be perfectly transferred to @xmath84 in the same way as in the linear case .",
    "generally , an arbitrary state , @xmath85 with one atom at an @xmath1-site processor a can also be transferred perfectly .",
    "a time - independent arbitrary unitary transformation @xmath86 does not change the commutation relations among angular momentum components , meaning that @xmath87 is mapped into @xmath88 , where the components of @xmath89 satisfy the same commutation relations .",

    "different values of @xmath2 could result in up to four different values of the signature factor @xmath118 .",
    "a perfect function transfer can simultaneously occur in , for instance , two paths .",
    "this resembles the inference of two waves .",
    "states sent from site a via different paths will interfere at site b ( fig .",
    "quantum interference effects in directed paths can produce measurable effects ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we can characterize the bosonic field operators @xmath124 at time @xmath125 , where @xmath126 denotes the two paths with the numbers of sites : @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",

    "the final intensity then becomes @xmath146 because we set the two paths ending up at the same site @xmath147 the intensity @xmath148 varies with different values of the signature @xmath118 .",

    "( [ n16 ] ) is equal to 4 , 0 and 2 , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to constructive , destructive , and in - between interferences .",
    "this site - number - dependent interference can be generalized to include contributions from many directed paths  @xcite .",
    "note that in quantum interference path - integral calculations  @xcite , summing over directed paths can require summing over an enormously large number of different terms , instead of just four different types of terms here .",
    "in other words , the @xmath152 group cyclic nature of the signature factor reduces the huge number of different terms used for standard interference calculations  @xcite to just summing over four possible values of @xmath118 , with @xmath153 .",
    "we have shown , by generalizing the recent results of  @xcite and  @xcite , that arbitrary functions can be sent perfectly ( without state initialization and remote collaboration ) through engineered interacting bosonic and qubit chains .",
    "as an example , we have analyzed perfect state transfers ( using , e.g. , ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices or polaritons in coupled cavities ) described by the bose - hubbard model with properly designed site - dependent tunneling amplitudes ( the so - called krawtchouk lattices ) .    in a more general case ,",
    "we have studied a family of linear and nonlinear hamiltonians that enable perfect state transfers according to dressing transformations leading to , e.g. , dressed qubits , dressed coherent state ( dressed displaced vacuum ) , or dressed squeezed vacuum .",
    "we have also shown that one can observe quantum interference of states , transmitted in two - dimensional lattices through various paths differing solely in the numbers of intermediate sites of each path .",
