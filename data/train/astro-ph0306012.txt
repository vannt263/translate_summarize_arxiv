    "collimated outflows / jets are produced from active galactic nuclei , compact stars in x - ray binaries , and young stellar objects ( ysos ) ( e.g. , krolik 1999 ; mirabel & rodriguez 1999 ; fender 2003 ; reipurth & bally 2001 ) . over the last two decades , evidence for jet precession in these systems has steadily increased .",
    "the clearest example is the galactic source ss 433 , whose jet direction varies with an approximate 164 day period ( margon 1984 ; eikenberry et al .",
    "the black hole binary gro j1655 - 40 shows jet precession with a period of 3 days ( tingay et al .  1995 ; hjellming & rupen 1995 ) .",
    "the jets from the super soft source cal83 may be precessing with a period of @xmath0 days ( cowley et al .",
    "1998 ) . in agns ,",
    "indirect evidence for jet precession is seen in the morphology of the radio hot spots , which show `` fossil '' components offset from the `` present '' component positions ( e.g. , cygnus a ) .",
    "finally , the changes in the flow directions of several yso jets have been interpreted in terms of jet precession ( e.g. terquem et al .",
    "1999 ; bates et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "a natural cause for jet precession is the changes of orientation of the underlying accretion disk .",
    "in addition , the super - orbital variabilities observed in a number of x - ray binaries ( e.g. , the 35-day periodicity in her x-1 ; see priedhorsky & holt 1987 ; ogilvie & dubus 2001 ) have long been interpreted as due to precession of a tilted accretion disk . in both x - ray binaries and ysos ,",
    "the tidal force from the companion star could play a role in driving the precession ( e.g. , katz 1973 ; wijers & pringle 1999 ; terquem et al .",
    "1999 ; bate et al .",
    "2000 ; ogilvie & dubus 2001 ) , although it may not be the only or the dominant effect ( e.g. , the 3 day precession period of the gro j1655 - 40 jet is too short to be explained by the tidal effect for a 2.6 day binary ) .",
    "most importantly , for the precession to operate , disk tilt needs to be excited and maintained . in accreting binary systems",
    ", the disk plane is expected to be aligned with the orbital plane since the disk angular momentum originates from the binary motion .",
    "for ysos in binaries , the disk plane may be initially misaligned with the orbital plane . however ,",
    "if we consider the disk as a collection of circular rings , different rings will have different precession rates ; it has been recognized that the combined effects of differential precession and internal disk stress / dissipation tend to damp the the disk tilt , so that the disk settles into the binary plane ( lubow & ogilvie 2000 ) .",
    "several driving mechanisms for disk tilt / warp have been proposed .",
    "schandl & meyer ( 1994 ) showed ( in the context of her x-1 ) that irradiation - driven wind from the outer parts of the disk can carry away momentum flux and make the disk unstable to warping .",
    "pringle ( 1996 ) showed that even without wind loss , radiation pressure itself can induce warping instability in the outer region of the disk .",
    "futher studies indicated this radiation - driven warping instability may indeed operate in x - ray binaries ( e.g. , maloney , begelman & nowak 1998 ; wijers & pringle 1999 ) , although it does not provide a generic explanation for the long - term variabilities in all x - ray binaries ( ogilvie & dubus 2001 ) . quillen ( 2001 ) showed that a wind passing over the disk surface may induce warping via kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "finally , in the case of disk accretion onto magnetic stars ( e.g. , neutron stars , white dwarfs and t tauri stars ) , the stellar magnetic field can induce disk warping and precession ( lai 1999 ; see also aly 1980 ; lipunov & shakura 1980 ; terquem & papaloizou 2000 ) ; this may explain several observed features of quasi - periodic oscillations in low - mass x - ray binaries ( shirakawa & lai 2002a ) , milli - hertz variabilities in accreting x - ray pulsars ( shirakawa & lai 2002b ) , and variabilities of t tauri stars ( terquem & papaloizou 2000 ; see also agapitou et al .",
    "1997 ) .    in this paper we suggest a new disk warping mechanism that is directly tied to the production of magnetically driven outflows / jets .",
    "using an idealized setup (  2 ) , we show that a disk threaded by a large - scale magnetic field may experience a warping instability and precess around the central object (  3 ) .",
    "these magnetically driven disk warping and precession arise from the interaction between the large - scale magnetic field and the induced electric current in the disk .",
    "while more studies are needed , we suggest that these effects may provide a natural explanation for the procession of jets / outflows and other variabilities observed in various systems (  4 ) .",
    "the current paradigm for the origin of astrophysical jets / outflows involves a large - scale magnetic field threading the accretion disk around a central object ( star or black hole ) ; this ordered magnetic field plays a crucial role in extracting / channeling mass , energy and angular momentum from the disk .",
    "the energy outflow can be either hydromagnetic ( with significant mass flux ) ( blandford & payne 1982 ) or electromagnetic ( dominated by poynting flux ) ( blandford 1976 ; lovelace 1976 ) . the origin of the disk - threading magnetic field is not completely clear : the field could be advected inwards by accretion , or generated locally by dynamo processes . in the case of protostellar outflows , the stellar magnetic field may play an important role ( shu et al .",
    "1994 ,  2000 ) .",
    "many theoretical / numerical studies have been devoted to understanding magnetically driven outflows / jets from accretion disks ( e.g. , see recent reviews by lovelace et al .  1999 ;",
    "knigl & pudritz 2000 ; meier et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows an idealized sketch of the magnetic field ",
    "disk configuration in which hydromagnetic outflows are produced .",
    "a geometrically thin disk is threaded by the poloidal magnetic field @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 are unit vectors in cylindrical coordinates ) .",
    "this poloidal field is of course curved ( with @xmath3 at the disk midplane ) , and we use the superscript `` + '' to denote the field at the upper disk surface . for a sufficiently inclined field ( radial pitch angle @xmath4 ) , centrifugally driven outflows are possible ( blandford & payne 1982 ) .",
    "the twisting of @xmath5 by the disk and the outflow gives rise to a toroidal field @xmath6 , which has different signs above and below the disk plane .",
    "we introduce the azimuthal pitch @xmath7 , so that @xmath8 at the upper disk surface . that @xmath7 is positive reflects the fact that the disk always rotates faster than the outflow , where @xmath9 is the the poloidal velocity of the outflow and @xmath10 its rotation rate ,",
    "@xmath11 is the disk rotation at the midplane .",
    "alternatively , in the absence of outflow , @xmath6 near the disk is governed schematically by the equation @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the disspation timescale . in steady state",
    ", we find @xmath14 , with @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is the vertical scale height in which @xmath17 in the magnetosphere varies . ] .",
    "the discontinuities in @xmath6 and @xmath18 across the disk imply a net disk surface current ( integrated over the disk thickness ) @xmath19 .",
    "thus , for an unpertutbed ( unwarped ) disk , the only torque on the disk ( per unit area ) is the usual magnetic braking torque t_z=12rb_zb_^+=-12rb_z^2 .",
    "[ eqtz]angular momentum is extracted out of the disk by the open field lines , and can be carried away by torsional alfven waves or a centrifugally driven wind ( for sufficiently inclined poloidal fields ) .",
    "in addition , the radial magnetic force , f_r = b_zb_r^+/(2 ) , [ eqfr]provides partial support of the disk against gravity .    the configuration shown in fig",
    ".  1 lies at the heart of many theoretical models of magnetic disk outflows .",
    "the real situation is certainly much more complicated .",
    "nevertheless , in  3 we shall adopt this simple picture in our consideration of magnetically driven disk warping and precession  our goal is to discuss these physical effects in a way that is as transparent as possible , so as to expose their robustness and potential pitfall .",
    "we now consider warping perturbations to the disk . the disk can be considered as a collection of circular rings which interact with each other via internal stresses .",
    "we specify the disk warping by the unit normal vector @xmath20 for the ring at radius @xmath21 .",
    "consider the situation ( see fig .",
    "2 ) in which the ring around radius @xmath21 is tilted by an angle @xmath22 while most of the disk remains flat ( @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the normal vector of the unperturbed disk ; see fig .  1 ) .",
    "since the magnetic field @xmath25 is produced by all the currents in the disk - outflow system , we posit that @xmath25 at radius @xmath21 is not modified by such a local perturbation . for the ring at @xmath21 , the field @xmath26 acts as an `` external '' magnetic field .",
    "now set up a coordinate system with the @xmath27-axis along the @xmath28 ( see the lower panel of fig .  2 ) and the associated cylindrical coordinate system @xmath29 . as in the case of the unperturbed disk , twisting of @xmath30 by the disk rotation",
    "produces a toroidal field ( in the new coordinate system ) @xmath31 ( where the subscript `` t '' serves as a reminder that this field is due to twisting of @xmath32 ) , whose value ( at radius @xmath21 ) at the upper disk plane is @xmath33 , and at the lower disk plane @xmath34 . note that @xmath32 is necessarily continuous across the disk plane in this perturbation .",
    "the radial surface current associated with @xmath35 is k_r =- c2 b_,t^+=c2b_z .",
    "interaction of this @xmath36 with @xmath32 gives an azimuthal force on the disk , and results in the magnetic braking torque ( per unit area ) @xmath37 , analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eqtz ] ) . unlike the unperturbed disk",
    ", however , the `` extrenal '' field @xmath38 now has a @xmath39-component , @xmath40 , and the interaction of @xmath36 with @xmath41 gives rise to a vertical force ( per unit area ) f_z=12b_z^2 .",
    "this vertical force can also be seen as arising from the imbalance of magnetic stresses above and below the disk plane : @xmath42 in the upper disk plane while @xmath43 in the lower disk plane , and thus @xmath44/(8\\pi)$ ] .",
    "obviously , averaging the force over the azimuthal angle , @xmath45 , gives zero .",
    "but since @xmath46 is unevenly distributed along the ring , it gives rise to a net torque on the ring . averaging over @xmath39 ,",
    "the torque per unit area is _",
    "warp&= & -14r b_z^2*y * + & = & -14r b_z^2 . clearly , this torque tends to pull the vector @xmath28 away from `` external '' magnetic field direction @xmath47 .",
    "this is the _ magnetically driven warping instability _ : for small tilt , the angle @xmath22 tends to grow ( in the absence of other forces ) at the rate _",
    "warp = b_z^24r_d , [ gwarp]where @xmath48 is the surface density , and @xmath11 the angular velocity of the disk . in a hypothetical situation ,",
    "if @xmath26 had a fixed direction for all @xmath22 , and if there were no coupling between different rings , the vector @xmath28 would evolve toward being perpendicular to @xmath26 , i.e. , the plane of the disk ( ring ) would prefer to lie along the `` external '' magnetic field ( cf .",
    "lai 1999 ) .    in the perturbed disk , the azimuthal surface current @xmath49 ( for small @xmath22 ) also interacts with the `` external '' field @xmath38 , which can be decomposed into @xmath50 .",
    "the interaction between @xmath51 and @xmath30 gives a radial force , as in eq .",
    "( [ eqfr ] ) . for the perturbed disk ( @xmath52 ) ,",
    "a new vertical force arises from the interaction between @xmath51 and @xmath53 : f_z=-1ck_b_z .",
    "this force is also equal to @xmath54/(8\\pi)$ ] , where @xmath55 .",
    "again , @xmath56 , but the net torque is non - zero .",
    "averaging over @xmath39 , we find the torque per unit area _",
    "prec=-12ck_b_z r*x * = -12ck_b_z r**. clearly , the effect of this torque is to make the ring ( at radius @xmath21 ) precess around the @xmath57-axis ( the unperturbed disk normal vector ) .",
    "the angular frequnecy of the _ magnetically driven precession _ is _ prec =- k_b_z2cr_d * * = -b_z^24r_d * * .",
    "[ oprec]the negative sign implies that the pecession is retrograde , i.e. , opposite to the disk rotation .",
    "to get an idea on the warping and precession timescales associated with eqs .",
    "( [ gwarp ] ) and ( [ oprec ] ) , we note the disk angular momentum equation ( for an unwarped disks ) can be written as v_rddr(_d r^2)=-12rb_z^2+t_visc , where @xmath58 is the radial velocity and @xmath59 is the viscous torque .",
    "if we set @xmath60 and use @xmath61 , we find _",
    "warp=|_prec| = -v_r4fr . for typical parameters ( @xmath62 ) , the warping timescale and precession period are of order the disk infall time @xmath63 .",
    "it is important to note that the magnetically driven disk warping and precession discussed in  3 are secular effects which operate on timescales much longer than the disk dynamical time . in deriving eqs .",
    "( [ gwarp ] ) and ( [ oprec ] ) , we have implicitly assumed that the perturbed disk ( see fig .  2 ) reaches a new steady state so that the magnetic field behaves in a similar way as in the unperturbed disk ( e.g. , @xmath64 ) .",
    "these effects are not captured in a dynamical perturbation analysis of the disk .",
    "clearly , our derivation of the magnetically driven warping and precession is far from being rigorous .",
    "nevertheless , it suggests that the warped , precessing disk - outflow may be an alternative ( and preferred ) state for the accretion disk threaded by large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "the effects of magnetically driven warping and precession discussed in this paper are analogous to the similar effects that exist in the accretion disks around magnetic stars ( lai 1999 ; shirakawa & lai 2002a , b ; pfeiffer & lai 2003 ; see also aly 1980 ; lipunov & shakura 1980 ) . in those systems ,",
    "the central star provides the `` external '' magnetic field for the disk .",
    "the warping and precessional torques arise from the interaction between the surface current on the disk and the horizontal magnetic field ( parallel to the disk ) produced by the stellar magnetic dipole . here , in the absence of the central magnetic star , the `` external '' magnetic field ( for the warped region of the disk ) is generated by the other currents in the disk - outflow system , and we have argued that similar torques exist : the warping torque relies on the surface current generated by the twisting of the vertical field threading the disk , while the precessional torque relies on the azimuthal screening current due to the diamagnetic response of the disk",
    ". the simplistic nature of our arguments ( perhaps even to the point of being wrong ) in  3 and the complexity of the real astrophysical systems ( see references in  2 ) preclude us from addressing many important issues such as the extent and location of the warped disk region . nevertheless , we are not aware of any previous discussion of these effects , and we think it is useful to present them so that they may be studied further by the astrophysics community .",
    "the magnetically driven warping and precession effects discussed in this paper potentially have advantages over the other disk warping mechanisms that are needed to explain jet precession ( see  1 ) .",
    "for example , the radiation driven warping instability ( pringle 1996 ) , while probably important for x - ray binaries ( ogilvie & dubus 2001 ) , is irrelevant for ysos ( since the instability operates at large disk radii ) .",
    "the magnetic effects discussed in this paper are directly connected to the large - scale magnetic field associated with the jet / outflow , and the model naturally predicts retrograde precession of the warped disk ( and thus the jet ) , in agreement with observations in x - ray binaries ( e.g. , her x-1 ) .",
    "the idea for this paper was motivated by the questions from chris mckee and frank shu following a seminar that the author gave at uc berkeley in 2001 .",
