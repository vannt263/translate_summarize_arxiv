    "the spectrum and form factors of excited nucleons are fundamental quantities for investigating the hadron structure within quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the excited nucleons are unstable and couple strongly to meson - baryon continuum states to form nucleon resonances ( called collectively as @xmath0 ) in @xmath8 and @xmath9 reactions .",
    "it is well known that resonances locate on the unphysical sheets of complex energy plane and thus their properties can only be extracted from the empirical partial - wave amplitudes by analytic continuation .",
    "recently we have applied an analytic continuation method developed in ref.@xcite to extract @xmath0 pole positions@xcite from @xmath8 elastic scattering amplitudes determined in a fit@xcite ( jlms ) within a dynamical coupled channel model@xcite ( ebac - dcc ) of meson - baryon reactions .",
    "the scattering amplitudes obtained from a dynamical coupled - channels model of meson - baryon reactions , such as the ebac - dcc model as well as the models developed in refs.@xcite , are not available in an analytic form .",
    "they are obtained numerically by solving coupled - channels integral equations with meson - exchange driving terms .",
    "thus , the predicted amplitudes can only be analytically continued to complex energy plane numerically with a careful account of the analytic structure of the considered scattering equations .",
    "obviously , the method depends on the dynamical content of each model . for ebac - dcc model ,",
    "this has been developed in ref.@xcite and established using several exactly soluble models . in this paper , we explain how this method is used to extract @xmath10 transition form factors from the multipole amplitudes determined from extending the jlms analysis to investigate @xmath11@xcite and @xmath12@xcite reactions .",
    "the electromagnetic @xmath13 transition form factors give information on the current and charge distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath14 .",
    "it can be shown@xcite that a resonance state @xmath15 with a complex energy @xmath16 can be defined as an eigenstate of hamiltonian @xmath17 with the outgoing boundary condition for its asymptotic wave functions .",
    "therefore the @xmath10 transition form factor is defined by the current matrix element @xmath18 which can be extracted from the residue @xmath19 of electromagnetic pion production amplitudes at the resonance poles . to extract @xmath19 , we need to evaluate the on - shell matrix elements of @xmath20 amplitudes on the complex riemann energy sheet .",
    "as will be discussed later , the analytic structure of the considered coupled - channels equations for getting these on - shell matrix elements is rather complex and must be dealt with carefully . in particular , we need to develop a formula to give an unified representation of the first two @xmath4 resonances which are near the @xmath5 threshold , but are on different riemann sheets .    to illustrate our approach , it is sufficient to only present results for the well isolated resonances in @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the complex @xmath4 partial waves . with only three complex parameters determined in the laurent expansion of each partial - wave amplitude at resonance pole position",

    "this finding agrees with what was reported in an analysis@xcite of @xmath8 scattering amplitude within the jlich model@xcite .",
    "here we show that this formula is also a good approximation for @xmath11 amplitudes . despite that this formula is similar to that used in the analysis@xcite using the breit - wigner parametrization of resonant amplitudes to fit the data , we find no simple relation between two approaches .    in section",
    "ii , we will briefly review the analytic continuation method developed in ref.@xcite and explain how it is applied to evaluate the on - shell amplitudes of @xmath21 transitions .",

    "a summary is given in section v.",
    "within the formulation@xcite for ebac - dcc model , the partial wave amplitudes of meson - baryon reactions can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 represent the meson - baryon ( mb ) states @xmath9 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27_{i , j } \\bar{\\gamma}_{\\alpha , j}(p;e )   \\label{eq : tr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath28_{i , j}(e)&= &   ( e - m_{n^*_i})\\delta_{i , j } - \\sigma_{i , j } ( e)\\ , .",

    "the dressed vertexes and the energy shifts of the second term in eqs.([eq : tr])-([eq : tr - g ] ) are defined by @xmath35 where @xmath36 defines the coupling of the @xmath37-th bare @xmath0 state to channel @xmath38 .",
    "because of the quadratic relation between energy @xmath39 and momentum @xmath40 , there are two energy sheets for each two - body channel : the physical ( unphysical ) sheet is identified with @xmath41 0 for the stable two - particle channels .",
    "thus the scattering amplitudes of an @xmath42-channels model are defined on a riemann energy sheet which consists of @xmath43 sheets .",
    "for the ebac - dcc model , defined by eqs.([eq : fullt])-([eq : selfe ] ) , each sheet can be defined by symbol @xmath44 , where @xmath45 could be @xmath40 or @xmath46 representing the physical or unphysical sheets of channel @xmath38 .",

    "the sheets from all other possible combinations of @xmath46 and @xmath40 are called unphysical sheets on which the scattering amplitude can have poles .",
    "we are however only interested in poles which have large effects on scattering observables and therefore they must be on the sheets which are near the @xmath47 physical sheet . these poles are called resonance poles , and other poles are called shadow poles .",
    "it is known@xcite that a shadow pole near the threshold of a channel can also have large effects on scattering observables and must also be considered in the search . as analyzed in ref.@xcite using several exactly soluble models , these poles are in most cases on sheets where the open(above threshold ) meson - baryon channels are on unphysical @xmath46 sheets and the closed(below threshold ) channels are on physical sheet . in below",
    "we first recall how the analytic continuation method we had developed in ref.@xcite is used to search for such resonance poles within ebac - dcc model .",
    "we then describe how it is used to extract the residues of the extracted resonance poles from on - shell amplitudes .",
    "since @xmath48 and the bare vertex @xmath49 are energy independent within the ebac - dcc model , the analytic structure of the scattering amplitude defined above as a function of @xmath39 is mainly determined by the green functions @xmath33 . thus the key for selecting the amplitude on physical sheet or unphysical sheet is to take an appropriate path of momentum integration @xmath50 in eqs.([eq : fullt])-([eq : selfe ] ) according to the locations of the singularities of the meson - baryon green functions @xmath51 as @xmath39 moves to complex plane .",

    "@xmath62 is on the axis of positive imaginary .",

    "we note that the momentum dependence of the helicity amplitudes indicates that the structure of @xmath203 and @xmath201 is quite different from @xmath204 .",
    "it is perhaps more appropriate to interpret our results calculated from using the unified form eq.(44 ) for the two poles near the @xmath5 threshold as the values associated with the roper @xmath205 resonance listed by pdg .",

    "here we also see that the contribution ( dot - dashed lines ) from the determined bare @xmath122 strengths play an important role in changing the sign of the real part at @xmath207 0.4 ( gev / c)@xmath189 .",
    "this sign change of the bare @xmath122 form factor is seen in some relativistic constituent quark model calculations@xcite .",
    "this suggests that our bare parameters can perhaps be interpreted in terms of hadron structure calculations excluding the meson - baryon coupled - channel effects which is determined by unitarity condition .",
    "here we mention that our real parts are qualitatively similar to the results from clas collaboration .",
    "but it is not clear how to make connection between two results since we have very appreciable imaginary parts .     of @xmath4 resonance at @xmath5 threshold extracted from using the unified representation eq.(46 ) .",
