    "the phobos experiment is studying au+au , cu+cu , d+au and p+p collisions at the nucleon - nucleon center of mass energies from @xmath3 gev to @xmath4 gev ( and @xmath5 gev for protons ) .",
    "for an overview of results see @xcite , for the description of the detector see @xcite .",
    "general properties of these collisions are measured using a large acceptance multiplicity detector covering almost the full solid angle .",
    "about 50% of the produced particles are registered in the central , octagonal part of multiplicity detector ( fig .  1 ) , whereas those emitted at smaller angles with respect to the beam line are detected in the multiplicity ring detectors placed a  few meters from the nominal interaction point ( not shown in fig .  1 ) .",
    "detailed information on about 1% of the particles is obtained from a two - arm magnetic spectrometer .",
    "the position of the primary interaction is precisely reconstructed using a specialized vertex detector , which registers about 5% of the primary particles . at rhic ,",
    "the beams of ions collide at zero degree , thus the primary vertices are distributed in a wide @xmath0  range along the beam line ( up to @xmath62  m from the nominal interaction point ) and only about @xmath60.1  cm in the perpendicular direction .",
    "the relatively small acceptance of the vertex detector is sufficient for vertex reconstruction for events with large multiplicities , but does not allow to extend the analysis to more peripheral au+au collisions or to the interactions of lighter systems , especially p+p .",
    "therefore , in order to improve the vertex determination efficiency and accuracy , several algorithms , presented in this paper , are needed using complementary information from different detector subsystems .",
    "the scintillator counters of the trigger system ( not shown in fig .",
    "1 ) deliver the first information on the position of the primary vertex .",
    "two larger detectors , paddle counters , are placed symmetrically at @xmath0  =  @xmath63.2  m from the nominal interaction point , two smaller t0 counters are mounted around the beam pipe at @xmath0  =  @xmath65.3  m for most measurements ( in p+p collisions they are moved closer , to",
    "@xmath0  =  -1.3  m and @xmath0  =  + 2.5  m ) .",
    "the coincidence of the signals from these detector pairs on different @xmath0-sides is used for triggering , but as the arrival times of produced particles are measured , the vertex @xmath0  position can be derived from the registered time difference .",
    "the error in the vertex position determination ( about 5  cm ) is small enough for an on - line vertex range selection , but it is not sufficient for data analyzes .    the vertex position in 3 dimensions ( @xmath7 ) can only be obtained from tracks reconstructed in the phobos spectrometer .",
    "it consists of 16  layers of silicon pad and strip sensors places inside the conventional 2  tesla magnet .",
    "the design of the magnet ensures that the first 8  layers of spectrometer silicon sensors are in an area where the field is very weak .",
    "this allows easier reconstruction of the first segment of the particle trajectory as a straight line , which is then normally joined with a curved part of the track found in the remaining layers . the acceptance for the straight line segments is larger than that for the fully reconstructed tracks and the information on the curved part does not improve track extrapolation to the vertex ,",
    "thus the straight lines are used in two algorithms of vertex reconstruction .    in the _ spectrometer 3d _ method ,",
    "the vertex position is defined as the point for which the sum of distances from the extrapolated tracks is minimal . in an iterative procedure ,",
    "tracks too distant from the calculated vertex ( eg .",
    "secondary particles ) are removed and the vertex is recalculated .",
    "the _ spectrometer 2d+1d _ algorithm enters the points of closest approach of all track pairs into 2-dimensional ( @xmath8 ) and 1-dimensional ( @xmath1 ) histograms .",
    "the coordinates of the maxima in both histograms define the approximate vertex position .",
    "the final vertex position is determined by the mean in @xmath2 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 of only those points compatible with the beam orbit and close enough to the approximate vertex .",
    "the sizes of the pads in the silicon sensors used for vertex reconstruction are relatively large ( 1@xmath91 mm@xmath10 and 0.427@xmath96 mm@xmath10 ) .",
    "this , together with small acceptance of the spectrometer , is responsible for the limited precision of the spectrometer methods .",
    "determination of the vertex position using all combination of hits registered in the vertex detector .",
    "dashed lines represent false combinations , continuous lines primary particles .",
    "the histogram of the number of tracks extrapolated to a fixed @xmath1 value ( at the bottom of the picture ) is used to find the position of the vertex . , width=283 ]    the phobos vertex detector consists of two parts placed above and below the beam pipe , 25  cm long in  @xmath0 , each with 2 layers of silicon sensors at about 5.7  cm and 11.8  cm from the beam .",
    "the sensors have strips 473 @xmath11 m wide and 1.2 or 2.4  cm long , perpendicular to the beam direction .",
    "the strips in the more distant outer layers are two times longer to cover the same azimuthal angle range .",
    "the design of the vertex detector limits the vertex reconstruction to @xmath1 and @xmath0  positions . in the vertex search",
    "all combinations of hits in the two layers are treated as track candidates and their extrapolated @xmath0 position at a fixed @xmath1 is histogrammed ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "@xmath12 is defined by the position of the maximum of such a histogram .",
    "this procedure is repeated for several values of fixed @xmath1 .",
    "the value of @xmath1 for which the maximum of the histogram is the highest is used as final @xmath13 . to accept the maximum at least three track candidates contributing to it",
    "are required , since without this cut coincidences of two false track candidates are selected in low multiplicity events more frequently than the true vertex .",
    "the correlation of the difference between the position of the hit and the position of the primary vertex , @xmath14 , and the registered energy loss @xmath15 in the phobos octagonal multiplicity detector . to correct for the different sensor thicknesses ,",
    "the measured energy loss is divided by the mean energy of a minimum ionizing particle traversing the sensor perpendicularly.,width=283 ]    in phobos , the largest fraction of primary particles is registered in the octagonal multiplicity detector consisting of 92 silicon sensors with 0.27@xmath90.86 cm@xmath10 pads . their thickness varies from 0.305  mm to 0.338  mm .",
    "the sensors are placed around the beam pipe at radii of about 4.5  cm and cover the @xmath0  range from -55  cm to + 55  cm . in this detector",
    "primary particles traverse only one silicon sensor and do not leave a track directly pointing to the vertex .",
    "however , the length of their trajectory inside the silicon ( and thus the deposited ionization energy , @xmath17 ) depends on the angle at which they enter the sensor ; for primary particles approximately the emission angle . in this way the measured energy loss is correlated with the distance of the hit from the vertex ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "most of the hits belong to one of the two ridges , symmetric with respect to @xmath14  =  0 .",
    "the hits left by particles with very low momenta , which deposit much larger energy than the minimum ionizing particles , are visible at @xmath14 close to zero as a tail of large @xmath17 values . because of the positive / negative @xmath14 ambiguity , the value of @xmath17 from a single hit can be used only to estimate the distance to the vertex or two alternative vertex positions . to determine",
    "the @xmath0 vertex position slices with fixed @xmath17 values are calculated from the 2-dimensional histogram shown in fig .",
    "several examples of these histograms are shown in fig .",
    "4 . using such histograms the probability density function , @xmath18 , for a particle that loses the energy @xmath17 at the position @xmath19 to originate from the vertex at @xmath20 is calculated .",
    "this function is non - zero in two @xmath0 ranges , symmetric with respect to @xmath19 . for",
    "most registered primary particles the width of a single range is 3 - 6  cm , and useful information is provided by the hits at the distance @xmath21 up to 100  cm . for a single hit",
    "there is no way to select the correct range , and one needs an overlap of several ranges from more hits to find the correct vertex position .",
    "the @xmath0 position of the vertex is determined by maximizing the product of the probabilities of all hits in the octagonal multiplicity detector .",
    "distributions of the distances between the primary vertex and the hits for several different values of the normalized energy loss @xmath15 .",
    "the histograms ( from left to right ) are obtained for @xmath15 equal 1.2 , 3 , 6 , 15 and 30.,width=283 ]",
    "in the analysis of the vertex reconstruction quality we will focus first on au+au collisions at the highest rhic energy , @xmath22 = 200 gev , using monte carlo simulations of the phobos detector response based on geant 3.21 package @xcite .     the vertex reconstruction efficiency for au+au collisions at @xmath22 = 200 gev defined as fraction of events for which the distance between the reconstructed and true vertices does not exceed 0.5  cm , 0.1  cm and 3  cm for the three methods : _",

    "the _ octagon _",
    "method is the most efficient ( about 95% for the inclusive sample of au+au collisions ) and for all events , in which the vertex can also be reconstructed using other , less efficient methods , it returns the correct position .",
    "all methods are optimized to reconstruct the vertex even for events with small multiplicities , thus for a fraction of events they fail to find the correct vertex position . in the case of the _ spectrometer 2d+1d _ method that results in a larger than typical error , while the _ vertex detector _",
    "method quite frequently finds a vertex close to @xmath0=0 in the events , where the true  @xmath12 is outside the acceptance of this detector .",
    "fortunately , for the later case the _ octagon _ method gives a different vertex position and , thus , such events can be eliminated from the analysis .    .",

    "belong these with the largest values of the number of charged primary particles hitting the octagonal multiplicity detector , to the peripheral sample these with the smallest multiplicities . for the most central events the efficiency of all methods is 100% ( not shown ) . in order to reduce the contribution of the tails of large errors",
    "the quoted resolution is taken from the fit of a gaussian rather than a simple rms of the @xmath24 distribution . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , it is worth to mention the overall efficiency of the vertex reconstruction methods for different types of interactions measured by the phobos experiment ( table 2 ) . for collisions of heavier nuclei ( au+au or cu+cu ) the efficiencies of the precise _ spectrometer _ and _ vertex detector _",
    "methods are close to 50% or higher . in the case",
    "that deuteron is one of the projectiles , the efficiency drops faster for the _ spectrometer _ method , and becomes very small for both methods in the case of p+p collisions .",
    "the _ octagon _",
    "method has an efficiency of more than 86% for nucleus+nucleus and more than 50% for p+p interactions .",
    "the phobos experiment utilizes several vertex reconstruction algorithms , which use complementary information from different subdetectors . according to the design goals ,",
    "a very precise vertex resolution is achieved in high multiplicity heavy ion collisions , but the limited acceptance of the spectrometer and vertex detector leads to low efficiency in peripheral au+au collisions , d+au and p+p interactions . to overcome this problem a new , very efficient method of vertex reconstruction using hits from a single layer octagonal multiplicity detector is introduced . even for low multiplicity events it efficiently finds the vertex with an error of about 1  cm .",
    "this method can either be used to verify doubtful results of the other algorithms or directly in studies , for which such precision is sufficient . such procedure for testing the vertices from different methods",
    "is implemented in the phobos experiment software .",
    "it rejects wrong reconstruction results and calculates the most accurate vertex position .",
