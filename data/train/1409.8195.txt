    "the theoretically predicted half - metallic character of fe@xmath3o@xmath4 @xcite has made magnetite one of the most studied transition metal oxide material for thin film applications in devices such as spin valves and magnetic tunnel junctions .",

    "the verwey transition temperature @xmath5 in thin films is also much lower , with reported values ranging from 100 to 120  k@xcite while the stoichiometric bulk has @xmath5 of 124 - 125 k. it is not clear why the verwey transition in thin films is so diffuse .    in this work ,",

    "oscillations in the rheed specular beam intensity , where each oscillation corresponds to the formation of one new atomic monolayer ( ml ) , allows for precise control of the film thickness . the crystalline structure was also verified _ in situ _ after the growth by low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) .",
    "all samples were also analyzed _ in situ _ by x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) .",

    "little has been done to study the influence of the oxygen content on the verwey transition itself with the resistivity as the order parameter in magnetite thin films .    to start our study",
    ", we first investigate the effect of the oxygen stoichiometry on the verwey transition of single crystalline epitaxial fe@xmath0o@xmath1 thin films .",

    "9 , we deduce that the hysteresis must be connected to growth aspects that make mgo substrates different from mao and sto .",
    "we infer that this is the presence of apbs of fe@xmath0o@xmath1 films on mgo associated with equivalent nucleation sites on the mgo separated by nonunit cell vectors of the fe@xmath0o@xmath1 lattice . for fe@xmath0o@xmath1 films on mao and sto , on the other hand",
    ", we expect the formation of apbs to be much less likely .",
    "indeed , it is quite conceivable that the presence of apbs constitute an important energy barrier for the crystal structure transformation across the verwey transition .",
    "to summarize , we have carried out a systematic experimental investigation to identify the parameters that determine the quality of the verwey transition in epitaxial fe@xmath0o@xmath1 thin films .",
    "we have maximized the transition temperature by optimizing the oxygen pressure used for the growth of the films and we have found that the substrate - induced microstructure plays a crucial role .",
    "the transition temperature , the resistivity jump , and the conductivity gap of fully stoichiometric films greatly depend on the domain size , which increases gradually with increasing film thickness .",
    "the broadness of the transition correlates strongly with the width of the domain size distribution .",
    "we infer that the width of the hysteresis is influenced strongly by the presence of antiphase boundaries .",
    "films grown on mgo ( 001 ) substrates showed the highest and sharpest transitions , while films grown on substrates with large lattice constant mismatch revealed very broad transitions . in all cases in which the verwey transition is present",
    ", the transition shows a hysteresis behavior and is therefore first order by nature , irrespective of the broadness in temperature of the transition .",
    "we note that for films grown on mgo substrates , anti - phase boundaries are inevitable , but perhaps prolonged annealing may help to increase the domain size @xcite . for films grown on spinel substrates , one can speculate that perhaps the domain size can also be enlarged by using substrates with smaller lattice mismatch .",
