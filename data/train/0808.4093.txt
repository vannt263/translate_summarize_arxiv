    "since the discovery of superconductivity at @xmath22 k in the iron - based lao@xmath23f@xmath24feas @xcite , great efforts have been devoted to explore new kind of iron oxypnictide superconductors with the higher superconducting transition temperature . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , through elemental substitution , @xmath21 was drastically raised to @xmath25 k ( @xmath26 k , the commonly assumed mcmillan limit ) in smo@xmath23f@xmath24feas @xcite that can be defined as a unconventional superconductor .",
    "one day later , superconductivity at 41 kelvin in another iron - based layered compound ceo@xmath27f@xmath24feas @xcite was reported .",
    "immediately , many group reported that the @xmath21 could be further increased to above 50 k , for example , 52 k in pro@xmath23f@xmath24feas @xcite , 55 k in smo@xmath23f@xmath24feas 55k and 56 k in gd@xmath23th@xmath24feaso @xcite . facing the rapid increase of @xmath21 ,",
    "researchers and the media have become too crazy about the new discovery @xcite .",
    "this situation is remarkably similar to that of the discovery of cuprate superconductors in 1986 .",
    "some researchers even claimed that the new discovery may pave the way for the development of superconductors that can operate at room temperature @xcite .    the quest for higher @xmath21 iron - based superconductors is still continuing .",
    "for all researchers , it is not known to what extent @xmath21 can increase in these materials . however , on 29 august , we argued that the superconducting transition temperature of the previously reported series compounds is difficult to break through @xmath28 k @xcite .",
    "later , steele concluded that since the metallic bond ( conduction band ) in the material is confined to the lines of iron atoms , the @xmath21 of any of these materials will never be as high as in the high-@xmath21 cuprates @xcite .",
    "now , more than two months have passed since our prediction that these materials could be adjusted by a appropriate charge carrier density to raise theirs @xmath29 by a few more kelvins . since then , though several new superconductors have been discovered @xcite , their @xmath30 are also lower than @xmath31 k ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) as our suggested .",
    "some readers are eager to know how can we make such a bold prediction ( the @xmath2 of the related materials has to be less than@xmath32 k ) ? in the present paper ,",
    "on the one hand , we try to answer the question raised above . on the other hand ,",
    "the ways how to achieve some higher @xmath21 iron - based superconductors are suggested .",
    "superconductivity was used to be considered as a peculiar physical phenomenon , which can only be observed in few special materials ( or elements ) . now , as more and more materials ( more than several thousands ) with different structures and physical properties have been discovered to exhibit superconductivity , the previous viewpoint must be changed . in our opinion , it is most likely that any crystalloid materials with a appropriate charge carrier density ( not too high , not too low ) may found to be the superconductors under an appropriate temperature .",
    "in fact , the field of superconductivity is in a transition from an old era [ which materials ( or elements ) can be a superconductor ? ] to a new era [ which materials ( or elements ) can not be a superconductor ? ] .",
    "therefore , it is unnecessary to be too excited about the observation of the superconductivity in layered iron arsenic compounds .    in the past century , the experimental scientists have discovered so many different kinds of superconductors , which greatly challenge the thinking of the theoretical physicists .",
    "what causes the superconductivity ? for most theoretical physicists , it seems natural that different superconductors will work differently , or we always need a new mechanism for a new superconductor .  to speculate the mechanisms for the various superconductors",
    ", they have spend a good deal of time using computers to compute numerical solutions to equations obtained by the complicated mathematical derivation .",
    "they mistakenly believe that the reliable results can only be expected by the applying of high - complex mathematics and advanced computer .",
    "we think this approach must be given up .",
    "it is time for us to realize that god did nt create superconductivity in such a complicated way as people considered to be .",
    "we believe that the superconductivity , as a common phenomenon in nature , its law should be intrinsically simple and deterministic @xcite .",
    "it is physically unrealistic to expect that the maths and computer can unravel the superconductivity mystery and tell us the right answer .",
    "in fact , the misuse of the mathematical and computing techniques rather than physics thinking may obscure the essential physics underlying the superconducting phenomenon .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the unit cell of three typical superconductors , they are ( a ) the conventional superconductor nb with a bcc structure , ( b ) the iron - based lao@xmath23f@xmath24feas and ( c ) the cuprate bi@xmath33sr@xmath33cacu@xmath34o@xmath35 . for the conventional superconductors , the mainstream physicist still believe that the bcs theory @xcite can explain the behavior of superconductivity . for the cuprate high-@xmath21 superconductors bednorz , a widely - accepted explanation is still missing despite great effort since 1986 .",
    "recently , anderson @xcite even pointed out that the need for a bosonic glue ( phonon ) in cuprate superconductors is folklore rather than the result of scientific logic and many theories about electron pairing in cuprate superconductors may be on the wrong track . for the new iron - based superconductors ,",
    "some researchers believe that the new family contains new mysteries and some new theoretical models should be invented .",
    "even though the bcs theory has been proved to be invalid in most of the known superconductors , this situation has not made researchers rethink one basic question : is the bcs theory correct ?",
    "most recently , i have discussed with prof .",
    "anderson about the reliability of bcs theory @xcite .",
    "he considered the application of the bcs theory of superconductivity should be confined within a small domain of materials , the polyelectronic metals .",
    "but , i have showed clearly that the phonon - mediated bcs theory is fundamentally incorrect ( see section ii of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "i insisted that the bcs theory is unsuitable not only for the non - conventional superconductors but also for the conventional superconductors .",
    "it is well known that the bcs theory was established on the basis of quantum mechanism , which is extreme sensitivity to a small perturbation of the hamiltonian of the studied system .",
    "one can recall the process of the establishment of the bcs theory , even for the simplest superconductor of fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , which included a large number of man - made physical hypotheses and mathematical approximations ( most of which are physically unreasonable ) .",
    "it is no doubt that , for the complex superconductors of figs .",
    "[ fig2](b ) and ( c ) , the quantum mechanics is powerless .",
    "we have to give up the original idea and procedure of bcs type , of course , the new theory of superconductivity should not be too concerned about the specific atomic structures of the superconductors .",
    "physically , the superconducting state is merely a charge - order phase in the superconductors .",
    "it is unwise to endow superconductivity with too many mysterious elements . in the framework of bcs theory ,",
    "the charge carriers are assumed to be in @xmath36-space ( dynamic screening ) order but @xmath37-space ( real - space screening ) disorder . from a strictly mathematical viewpoint , @xmath36-space picture and @xmath37-space picture",
    "are tightly correlated , obviously , the bcs picture is unwarranted conjecture in both physics and maths .",
    "we argue that a reasonable superconducting theory must be mathematically self - consistent , in other words , the charge carriers should display a similar degree of order in both @xmath36-space and @xmath37-space .",
    "in addition , we believe that a physical theory in real - space picture is naturally more reliable than that in momentum - space picture , as all physical phenomena take place in the real space rather than the imaginary @xmath36-space .    recently , we have developed a real space vortex - lattice based theory of superconductivity which can naturally explain some complicated problems in conventional and non - conventional superconductors , included the new iron arsenide superconductors unified , huang0,huang1,huang2,huang3,huang4,huang5 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "fig3(a ) , the mechanism contains two main factors : the framework structure ( black lines ) of atoms and the vortex lattice ( red lines ) of the charge carriers ( electrons ) . in this case , a real space long range magnetic order ( vortex line , or stripe ) and superconductivity coexist to form a dimerized charge supersolid ( a charge - peierls dimerized transition ) , as seen in fig . [",
    "fig3](b ) .    in the previous studies@xcite , we argued that the physically significant critical value for the most stable vortex lattice is that at which a uniform distribution of vortex lines in the plane perpendicular to the stripes . in this sense , two low - temperature tetragonal phases ( ltt1 and ltt2 ) and two simple hexagonal phases ( sh1 and sh2 ) might be the ideal candidates for the stable charge - stripe order of paired electrons , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .    for a doped superconductor , the charge carrier doping level @xmath38",
    "is given by    @xmath39    and the corresponding charge carrier density is@xmath40where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath36 , and @xmath43 are integral numbers , and @xmath44 and @xmath45  are the unit cell volumes of the  lattice and the corresponding superlattice , respectively .    it should be pointed out that , for most actual superconducting materials , their superconducting vortex lattices are likely in some not standard vortex structures with some degree of distortion compared to the standard structures of fig .",
    "obviously , the distortion of the vortex lattice can affect the stability of the superconducting state , at the same time decrease the superconducting transition temperature of the corresponding superconductor .",
    "experimentally , by exerting an external pressure on the superconductor , or through the substitution of smaller ions ( chemical inner pressure ) , the vortex lattice distortion can be corrected in some extent , as a result , increasing the @xmath21 of the studied superconductor .",
    "these effects imply that the shrinking of the lattice constants may enhance the @xmath21 of the superconductor .",
    "but in the following discussions we will show that increasing the @xmath1-axis lattice constant can result in a much more intensive enhancement of @xmath21 in the iron - based superconductors .",
    "it must be pointed out that these two conclusions are not contradictory .",
    "just as in the cuprate superconductors , although it has been proven that the reducing of the lattice constants  by an external pressure through is probable resulting in the increasing of the @xmath29 in these superconductors , however it is no doubt that the most effective means of enhancing @xmath21 is by means of increasing @xmath1-axis lattice constant of the superconductors .  as we can see that the @xmath21 of the cuprate superconductors had been raise easily from the @xmath46 k of the la@xmath47ba@xmath24cuo@xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , to @xmath50 k of the yba@xmath33cu@xmath48o8@xmath48 ( @xmath51 ) , @xmath52 k of the bi@xmath33sr@xmath33ca@xmath33cu@xmath53o@xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) and @xmath56 k of the hgba@xmath33ca@xmath33cu@xmath53o ( @xmath57 )",
    "the potential physical reasons behind these results are still unclear .    according to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the @xmath21 of a superconductor is directly proportional to the stability of the superconducting vortex lattice phase .",
    "there are three factors ( temperature , charge carrier density and @xmath1-axis lattice constant ) that affect vortex lattice s situations , which in turn influence the @xmath21 of a superconductor .",
    "each of these influences will be discussed in greater detail in the following subsections .",
    "[ temperature ]      in the ideal situation of absolute zero temperature , the vibration of the lattice framework and the flustration of the vortex lines ( stripes ) can be neglected , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) . in this special case ,",
    "the vortex lattice is in the most stable minimum energy superconducting state ( the so - called ground state ) . when @xmath58 , there exist inevitably the vibration of the lattice framework and the flustration of the vortex lines , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig5](b ) .",
    "furthermore , these may directly lead to a stronger stripe - stripe interaction due to a shorter minimum stripe - stripe distance ( @xmath59 ) . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) , the stripe - stripe interaction increased with the increasing of the temperature ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "these discussions imply that temperature on the impact of the superconducting transition temperature @xmath21 is always negative and the lattice vibration ( phonon ) is impossible to provide the glue  for the superconductors @xcite .",
    "it is well known that , in both the cuprate and the new iron - pnictide high - temperature superconductors , their superconducting transition temperature @xmath21 can be modified by the charge carrier density @xmath61 ( or the doping level @xmath38 ) .",
    "so far , though the influence of the carrier concentration on the fundamental properties of high-@xmath21 superconductors has been experimentally and theoretically studied by many investigators .",
    "scientists have not yet reached a consensus on this issue .    in our theoretical framework of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the relationship between the charge carrier density and @xmath21 is very simple and intuitive .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , in a low doping superconducting vortex phase of fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) , the nearest neighbor distance ( @xmath62 ) between the vortex lines is large , so that the stripe - stripe interactions are weak and the superconductor is expected to have a higher @xmath21 . when further charge carriers are added to the superconductor , the vortex lines [ see fig .",
    "fig6(b ) ] become more crowd than that of fig . [",
    "fig6](a ) ( @xmath63 ) . as a result",
    ", a higher charge - carrier density will produce a stronger interaction among the vortex lines and consequently lead to a lower @xmath21 .",
    "figure [ fig6](c ) shows an extreme case ( with the doping level @xmath64 ) in which each unit cell contains two electrons , obviously , the superconducting vortex lattice no longer exists due to the great enhancement of the stripe - stripe interactions .",
    "these result strongly suggest that a superconducting phase can be destroyed easily by the extra charge carriers in a superconductor .",
    "we consider the picture of fig . [ fig6](c ) provides a vivid interpretation : why the good conductors ( cu , au , and ag ) and overdoped high-@xmath21 superconductors do not achieve or exhibit superconductivity ? in brief , the superconducting state is characterized by a real - space periodic vortex lattice while the non - superconducting state is dominated by the anomalous distribution of charge carriers .      for the cuprate superconductors ,",
    "there are many experimental facts showing a strong dependence of the maximum superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath2 ) on the @xmath1-axis lattice constant .",
    "normally , a superconductor with a larger @xmath1-axis lattice constant may have a higher maximum superconducting transition temperature .",
    "but the dependency of @xmath0 on the @xmath5-axis ( or @xmath65-axis ) lattice constant is much less sensitive compared to that of the @xmath1-axis lattice constant .    here",
    ", we try to uncover the possible relationships between the lattice constant @xmath1 and @xmath0 based on the scenario in fig .",
    "suppose there are two different kinds of superconductors with the lattice constants ( @xmath5 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) and ( @xmath5 , @xmath65 , @xmath67 ) respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "if @xmath68 , some hexagonal vortex lattices can be formed in the superconductors at some appropriate doping levels @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig7](a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) respectively .",
    "as can be seen from the figures , all the superconducting layers are doped in the cases of figs .",
    "[ fig7](a ) and ( c ) , it is clear that the former case ( for the superconductor having a shorter @xmath1-axis parameter ) will exhibit a lower @xmath21 due to a much stronger stripe - stripe interaction among the crowded vortex lines . of course , by reducing the charge carrier concentration in the superconductor of fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) , it is possible that the two superconductors could have the same charge carrier density , are shown in figs . [ fig7](b ) and ( c ) . it should be noted that only half of the superconducting layers are doped in fig . [ fig7](b ) .",
    "this inevitably lead to the escapement of electrons from the vortex lines to the undoped layers , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) , consequently , decreases the stability of the superconducting vortex lattice and reduces the corresponding superconducting transition temperature . for a even shorter @xmath1-axis lattice constant , for example @xmath72 ( @xmath73 )",
    ", there will be more undoped layers in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) and this may greatly increase the possibility of the electrons going wrong into these non - superconducting layers , thereby increase the instability of the superconducting vortex lattice state .",
    "in other words , by separating the planes of the superconducting layers by inert some non - superconducting layers , the superconducting vortices will be stabilized to a greater extent , thus raising @xmath21 of the superconductor .",
    "it is apparent from the above discussions that a materials with a larger @xmath1-axis lattice constant could potentially be a high - temperature superconductor .",
    "this does not mean that the @xmath21 can increase unboundedly by the increasing of the @xmath1-axis lattice constant of the superconducting material .",
    "in our mechanism of superconductivity , it is not difficult to find that a appropriate stripe - stripe interaction is absolutely necessarily for the formation of the superconducting vortex lattice .      in this subsection , from the viewpoint of energy , we elaborate on the relationship between the stability of superconducting vortex phase and the two physical parameters ( temperature @xmath74 and lattice constant @xmath1 ) .",
    "physically , the stability of one superconducting phase will decrease with the increase of the superconductor s energy .",
    "in subsection [ temperature ] , it had been shown that the temperature remained unconducive to the formation of the superconducting vortex state .",
    "this conclusion can be expressed simply by@xmath75where @xmath76 denotes the temperature - dependent energy of the vortex lattice , @xmath74 is the temperature and @xmath77 is a structure and material - related parameter .    similarly , the results of the discussions in subsection[charge ] and subsection[lattice ] can be explicitly presented as follows @xmath78where @xmath79 denotes the ( charge carrier density and @xmath1-axis lattice constant)-dependent energy of the vortex lattice , @xmath1 is the @xmath1-axis lattice constant and @xmath80 is another material - related parameter . combining eqs .",

    "the superconducting vortex phase should satisfy the following criterion@xmath85while for the non - superconducting phase , we have @xmath86    in the following sections , we will apply the above general analysis to the specific iron - based superconductors .",

    "[ fig8](a ) of @xmath3 class , the blue curve indicates that the maximum @xmath2 of this group is difficult to exceed 60 k. in addition , there are two exceptional values , as marked in the subfigure , which are most likely to belong to a new class of @xmath91 . for the @xmath92 class , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) , the highest superconducting transition temperature is about 40 k due to the relatively small @xmath1-axis lattice constants .",
    "by adjusting the sample carrier concentration and improving the sample quality , it may still be possible to raise the @xmath21 of the iron - based family by a few more kelvins . according to our theory ,",
    "increasing the @xmath1-axis lattice constant appeared to be the most effective method of enhancing @xmath21 in feas family . in",
