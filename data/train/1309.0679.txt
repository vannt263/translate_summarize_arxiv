    "current cosmological observations , such as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) measurements of temperature anisotropies and polarization at high redshift @xmath13 and the redshift - distance measurements of snia at @xmath14 , have demonstrated that the universe is now undergoing an accelerated phase of expansion .",
    "the simplest explanation is that this behavior is driven by the cosmological constant or the dynamical dark energy models . on the other hand ,",
    "this observed late - time acceleration of the expansion on the large scales could also caused by some modifications to general relativity .",
    "one of well - known examples is the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) braneworld model @xcite , in which the gravity leaks off the four dimensional minkowski brane into the five dimensional bulk minkowski space - time . in the framework of flat dgp model",
    ", the friedmann equation will be modified as @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the crossover scale .",
    "this model realizes the so - called self - accelerating universe that features a four - dimensional de sitter phase .",
    "however , recent studies have indicated that this self - accelerating branch of dgp model has been ruled out by the current observational data @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this self - accelerating solutions suffers the serious problem of ghost excitations @xcite . even at the classical level",
    ", this theory is pathological .    in this paper",
    "we investigate an interesting phenomenological model , first introduced in ref.@xcite , which interpolates between the pure @xmath0cdm model and the dgp model with an additional parameter @xmath1 . assuming the flatness of our universe , the friedmann equation is modified as @xcite : @xmath17 where the crossover scale becomes @xmath18 .",
    "thus , we can straightforwardly rewrite the above equation and obtain the expansion rate as following : @xmath19 where the last term denotes the modification to the friedmann equation of general relativity : @xmath20 here , @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the pure @xmath0cdm model and the dgp model , respectively .",
    "since the planck collaboration has released the first cosmological papers providing the highest resolution , full sky , cmb maps @xcite , it is important to study the dgp model and revisit the constraint on parameters from the latest cosmological probes . in this paper we investigate this phenomenological dgp model and present the tight constraints from the latest planck and wmap9 data , the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) measurements from several large scale structure ( lss ) surveys , the `` union2.1 '' compilation which includes 580 supernovae and the gaussian prior on the hubble constant @xmath12 .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section [ data ] we describe the latest observational data sets used in the numerical analyses ; section [ result ] contains our main global constraints on the phenomenological dgp model from the current observations .",
    "the last section [ sum ] is the conclusions .",
    "in our analysis , we consider the following cosmological probes : i ) distance information of cmb measurements ; ii ) the baryon acoustic oscillation in the galaxy power spectra ; iii ) measurement of the current hubble constant ; iv ) luminosity distances of type ia supernovae .",
    "cmb measurement is sensitive to the distance to the decoupling epoch via the locations of peaks and troughs of the acoustic oscillations .",
    "here we use the  distance information \" , following the wmap group @xcite , which includes the  shift parameter \" @xmath2 , the  acoustic scale \" @xmath3 , and the photon decoupling epoch @xmath4 .",

    "the decoupling epoch @xmath4 is given by ref.@xcite : @xmath26[1+g_1(\\omega_m h^2)^{g_2}]~,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 we calculate the likelihood of the cmb distance information as follows : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the parameter vector and @xmath30 is the inverse covariance matrix for the cmb distance information .",

    "@xcite has demonstrated that the distance information from the wmap measurement is almost independent on the input dark energy models . following the method described in ref .",
    "@xcite , here we also check the distance information obtained from the planck measurement in different input dark energy models , shown in figure [ planck_dis ] .",
    "we find that , the distributions of the distance priors given by the planck temperature power spectrum are almost the same in three different dark energy models : the standard @xmath0cdm , the dark energy models with a constant equation of state ( @xmath52cdm ) or a time - evolving equation of state ( @xmath53 @xcite ) ( @xmath54cdm ) . in table [ dp_num ] we list constraints on @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath33 from the planck data in different input dark energy models . therefore ,",

    "this is a significant improvement over the previous prior , @xmath64 @xmath62 , which is from the hubble key project final result .",
    "in addition , we impose a weak top - hat prior on the hubble parameter : @xmath65 $ ] @xmath62 .    finally , we include data from type ia supernovae , which consists of luminosity distance measurements as a function of redshift . in this paper",
    "we use the latest sn data sets from the supernova cosmology project , `` union compilation 2.1 '' , which consists of 580 samples and spans the redshift range @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "this data set also provides the covariance matrix of data with and without systematic errors . in order to be conservative",
    ", we use the covariance matrix with systematic errors . when calculating the likelihood from sn , we marginalize over the absolute magnitude m , which is a nuisance parameter , as done in ref.@xcite .",

    "we show the two - dimensional contours in the ( @xmath70 ) panel . as we know",
    ", the cmb anisotropies mainly contain the information about the high - redshift universe , but it is not directly sensitive to lower - redshift phenomena , such as the nature of accelerating universe .",

    "[ planck],title=\"fig : \" ]    besides the direct @xmath12 probe , we also consider some other low - redshift probes , like bao and snia , in our analysis . in the right panel of figure [ planck ]",
    "we show the constraints on @xmath1 from bao ( blue ) and snia ( magenta ) , respectively , which are similar with that obtained from the planck data .",
    "however , different from the degeneracy between @xmath5 and @xmath1 in the planck data ( red ) , @xmath5 and @xmath1 are strongly anti - correlated .",
    "the reason for this degeneracy is that the constraint mainly comes from the luminosity and angular diameter distance information . from eqs.([ez ] ) and ( [ deltah ] ) we can see that when @xmath1 is increased , the contribution of the last @xmath1 term to the expansion rate will become large , due to the positive @xmath79 . consequently , @xmath5 must be decreased correspondingly in order to produce the same expansion rate .",
    "therefore , when we combine the bao or snia and the planck data , the joint constraints are significantly shrunk , namely the @xmath7 upper limits are @xmath80 and @xmath81 from planck+bao and planck+snia , respectively . when we combine all these data together ( green ) , the constraint on @xmath1 becomes tighter further , @xmath82 the flat dgp model ( @xmath22 ) has been ruled out with very high significance , which is consistent with other works ( see e.g. refs .",

    "therefore , @xmath83 corresponds to the effective eos @xmath86 at high redshifts .",
    "interestingly , there is a possibility where the parameter @xmath1 is less than zero . in this case",
    ", the effective eos can be more negative than @xmath87 , without violating the weak - energy condition @xcite .",
    "thus , we extend our previous analyses and allow the parameter @xmath8 . in figure [ alpha_less ]",
    "we show the two - dimensional contour in the ( @xmath88 ) pane obtained from all data sets together .",
    "the data yield the tight constraint on the additional parameter of @xmath89 which implies that the pure @xmath0cdm model ( @xmath72 ) is consistent with the data , but the model with a negative value of @xmath1 is slightly favored .",
    "based on the equation of @xmath90 , we can see that the current observational data favor the effective eos of dark energy @xmath91 , which is consistent with previous works @xcite .",
    "since @xmath1 and @xmath12 are anti - correlated , consequently , a high value of the hubble constant is also obtained : @xmath92 @xmath62 ( @xmath10 c.l . ) , which is consistent with the direct probe of @xmath12 from the hst measurement @xcite .",
    "as an alternative approach to generate the late - time acceleration of the expansion of our universe , models of modifications of gravity have attracted a lot of interests in the phenomenological studies recently . in this paper we investigate an interesting phenomenological model which interpolates between the pure @xmath0cdm model and the flat dgp braneworld model with an additional parameter @xmath1 .",
    "we find that the cmb data alone can not give tight constraint on @xmath1 , due to the strong degeneracies among @xmath5 , @xmath12 and @xmath1 .",

    "planck data give a higher value of @xmath5 than that from wmap9 data , which is similar with the tension found by the planck group .",
    "when we add the hst prior , bao or snia , the constraint on @xmath1 becomes significantly stringent .",
    "combining all data together , we obtain the tightest constraint on the parameter @xmath6 at @xmath7 confidence level , which implies that the flat dgp model ( @xmath22 ) is incompatible with the current observations , while the pure @xmath0cdm model still fits the data very well .",
