    "dynamical fermion algorithms play a crucial role in the simulation of lattice field theories .",
    "the favorite algorithm for an even number of fermion species is the hybrid monte carlo hmc algorithm @xcite . in this paper",
    "we introduce and test an improved version of this algorithm in the case of supersymmetric quantum mechanics .",
    "we show that the improved algorithm is far superior to the usual hmc procedure in combating the effects of critical slowing down .",
    "we first discuss the usual hmc algorithm and show how it may be generalized to allow for fourier acceleration . the idea is closely related to the usual fourier acceleration used for langevin simulations - both the fields and their conjugate momenta are evolved in momentum space throughout an individual hmc trajectory - the crucial improvement being to choose a wavelength dependent timestep .",
    "the momentum dependence of this timestep is chosen so as to render the magnitude of the resulting update of a given fourier component insensitive to its wavevector index .",
    "we test this algorithm in supersymmetric quantum mechanics treated as a euclidean lattice theory .",
    "this model is formulated on the lattice in such way as to leave intact an exact subgroup of the continuum supersymmetry .",
    "we are able to demonstrate that the improved algorithm reduces the dynamical critical exponent to values close to zero on lattices as large as @xmath0 and correlation lengths @xmath1 .",
    "we will be concerned with simulations of models involving scalar and fermion fields .",
    "the typical action we will be discussing takes the general form : s(x,,)=s_b(x)+m(x)containing a bosonic field @xmath2 and a dirac field @xmath3 defined on a lattice in euclidean space . the fermion matrix @xmath4 will contain lattice derivative terms together with couplings to the bosonic field @xmath2 .",
    "the partition function for this system is then just z = dxde^-s(x , , )    in order to simulate this action we first replace the fermion field by a bosonic pseudofermion field @xmath5 whose action is @xmath6 this is an exact representation of the original boson effective action in the case where @xmath7 ( which will be the case for susy qm ) .",
    "the resultant nonlocal action @xmath8 can be simulated using the hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) algorithm @xcite . in the hmc scheme _ momentum",
    "_ fields @xmath9 conjugate to @xmath10 are added and a _ hamiltonian _ @xmath11 constructed from the original action and additional terms depending on the momenta : @xmath12 @xmath13 the corresponding partition function @xmath14 is , up to a constant factor , identical to the original @xmath15 .",
    "the augmented system @xmath16 is now associated with a classical dynamics depending on an auxiliary time variable @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19    introducing a finite time step @xmath20 allows us to simulate this classical evolution and to produce a sequence of configurations @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath22 then @xmath11 would be conserved along such a trajectory . as @xmath20 is finite @xmath11",
    "is not exactly conserved .",
    "however a finite length of such an approximate trajectory can be used as a _ global _",
    "move on the fields @xmath10 which may then be subject to a metropolis step based on @xmath23 . provided the discrete , classical dynamics is reversible and care is taken to ensure ergodicity the resulting move satisfies detailed balance and hence this dynamics will provide a simulation of @xmath24 and hence also of the original partition function @xmath15 .",
    "ergodicity is taken care of by drawing new momenta from a gaussian distribution after each trajectory .",
    "the reversibility criterion can be satisfied by using a leapfrog integration scheme .",
    "its general form for a field @xmath2 with associated momentum @xmath25 can be written as @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an associated force and a is an arbitrary matrix .",
    "notice our notation  the fields are indexed by a integer vector giving their lattice position .",
    "this update indeed satisfies the time reversibility criterion : inverting the sign of momentum as @xmath28 and updating the resultant configuration leads to @xmath29 , @xmath30 .    to implement our improved algorithm we choose a matrix @xmath31 whose elements depend only on the difference of the lattice vectors between two sites @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34    we then take the lattice fourier transform of equation  3 . to arrive at an update equation for the fourier components @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the fourier components of the field @xmath37 are given by the discrete transform _",
    "* k*=_*r * e^i*k.r * x_*r * with similar expressions for @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "because of the lattice convolution theorem the dependence of this momentum space update on the fourier coefficients @xmath39 may then be completely absorbed into the definition of a wavelength dependent time step @xmath40 .",
    "the final update equations take the form @xmath41    the final step in applying fourier acceleration to this update is to choose the acceleration kernel @xmath42 so as eliminate the wavelength dependence of the update in the free theory @xcite . for the update of a bosonic field",
    "this implies that we should utilize the square root of the momentum space lattice propagator .",
    "such a propagator contains a mass parameter @xmath43 which can be tuned to optimize the update . in the free theory",
    "it should clearly be set to the bare lattice mass , but in a general interacting theory it is left as a parameter . in this paper",
    "we provide evidence that the autocorrelation time is optimized by setting @xmath43 to the approximate position of the massgap . the fermionic kernel is then chosen to be the inverse of the bosonic kernel .",
    "notice the occurrence of the square root of the momentum space lattice propagator here - rather than the propagator itself which would be usual in fourier accelerated langevin algorithms - this reflects the fact that here the hmc update corresponds to a discrete second order differential equation in time unlike the first order langevin equation .",
    "this choice of the square root propagator was _ not _ made in @xcite and may explain , in part , why acceleration led to only small reductions in the autocorrelation time .",
    "a simple way to demonstrate the effectiveness of this update is to consider supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite which contains a real scalar field @xmath2 and two independent real fermionic fields @xmath3 and @xmath44 defined on a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath45 sites with periodic boundary conditions imposed on both scalar and fermion fields : s=_ij(d_ijx_j+p_i ) ( d_ijx_j+p_i)+ _ ij_i(d_ij+p^_ij)_j [ action ] for our simulations the quantity @xmath46 and its derivative are chosen as : @xmath47 @xmath48 the symmetric difference operator @xmath49 and the wilson mass matrix @xmath50 are defined as : @xmath51\\ ] ] @xmath52 here dimensionless lattice units are @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 and the discrete momenta take on the values @xmath56 with @xmath57 . notice that this model employs a non - standard boson action containing not the usual scalar lattice laplacian but the square of the symmetric difference operator .",
    "this is done in order to treat the fermions and bosons in a symmetric manner - indeed because of this the action is invariant under a single susy - like symmetry . @xmath58",
    "doubles in both bosonic and fermionic sectors are eliminated by means of the wilson mass term @xmath59 .",
    "the physics results from this study were published in @xcite .    for bosonic and pseudo - fermionic field",
    "updates respectively we use the following timesteps which are simple inverses of each other .",
    "suppose that @xmath62 is some observable and @xmath63 is a measurement of @xmath62 in configuration corresponding to monte - carlo time @xmath17",
    ". then the autocorrelation function is defined as : @xmath64 typically the function @xmath65 is approximately exponential @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the autocorrelation time - the time between decorrelated configurations .",
    "clearly we can define @xmath67 also from the relation @xmath68 and this yields a robust way to estimate @xmath67 even when @xmath65 is not exactly an exponential - measured this way it is sometimes referred to as the integrated autocorrelation time .",
    "it also provides a convenient way to find the autocorrelation time from a sequence of @xmath69 monte carlo measurements = _",
    "i=1^n_j = i^j < m where we measure the autocorrelation function only out to @xmath4 steps ( we must choose @xmath70 ) .",
    "the efficiency of different simulation algorithms can be described in terms of the dynamic critical exponent @xmath71 : @xmath72 an algorithm which resulted in @xmath73 is said to suffer no critical slowing down while most local algorithms such as conventional hmc typically yield @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath75 vs @xmath76 for supersymmetric quantum mechanics with @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79.,width=415 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] represents the autocorrelation time @xmath67 as a function of @xmath43 for lattice susy qm with @xmath78 , @xmath79 for a lattice with @xmath77 sites .",
    "notice that the dimensionless parameter characterizing the interaction strength @xmath80 is unity in this case - we are in a strong coupling regime .",
    "the massgap of the theory for these values of the bare parameters can be calculated via hamiltonian methods and yields a value @xmath81 .    for large @xmath82",
    "the update can be shown to reduce to the usual local hmc algorithm and , as the plot makes clear , leads to a maximal value for @xmath67 .",
    "indeed the minimal value of @xmath67 is can be seen to be achieved by setting @xmath43 approximately equal to the massgap of the model @xmath83 . in the vicinity of this point",
    ", one can see that the minimum autocorrelation @xmath84 is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath67 achieved by the usual local algorithm for this lattice size .",

    "the plot makes it clear that this is a lower bound for @xmath71 so that in all likelihood @xmath71 achieves a value of @xmath91 for very large lattices .",
    "this is to be contrasted to fig  [ fig3 ] which shows the same plot for @xmath92 .",
    "a fit in this case yields a value of @xmath71 consistent with zero . for the largest lattice size @xmath0",
