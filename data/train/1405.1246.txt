    "the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite conjectures that string / m theory in an anti - de sitter ( ads ) space ( times some compact space ) is dual to a strongly coupled conformal field theory ( cft ) living on the ads boundary . in this sense ,",
    "thermodynamics of black holes in ads space can be identified with the one of the dual strongly coupled cfts  @xcite , while the latter is not able to be obtained through conventional perturbative quantum field theory .",
    "this is one of reasons for many recent studies of black holes in ads space . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also of great interest to investigate black holes in ads space in its own right . compared to its counterpart in asymptotically flat spacetime ,",
    "the horizon of black holes in ads space has much rich topological structure : ads black holes can have positive , zero and negative constant curvature horizon .",
    "these black holes have been discussed extensively , for example , in einstein-(maxwell ) theory  @xcite-@xcite , einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory  @xcite , wely conformal gravity  @xcite , gauss - bonnet gravity  @xcite , and more general lovelook gravity  @xcite , etc .",
    "it turns out that thermodynamical properties of ads black holes crucially depend on horizon structure . for ( positive constant curvature )",
    "spherical horizon black holes in ads space , there exists a minimal black hole temperature , under which there is no black hole solution .",
    "the black hole is thermodynamically unstable for smaller black hole horizon , while it is thermodynamically stable for larger horizon .",
    "therefore there exists a so - called hawking - page phase transition  @xcite between the thermal gas and stable large black hole in ads space .",
    "this phase transition can be identified with the confined / deconfined transition of gauge field in the dual cft side  @xcite . for the black holes with ( zero curvature ) ricci flat horizon and ( negative curvature ) hyperbolic horizons ,",
    "however , they are always thermodynamically stable ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this means that the black hole phase is always dominated in the dual conformal field theory side . in this case",
    ", the hawking - page phase transition will not happen .",
    "conformal anomaly  @xcite plays an important role in quantum field theories in curved spacetime and has various applications in black hole physics , cosmology , string theory , and statistical mechanics , etc .",
    "the effective action associated with the trace anomaly is non - local , but in four dimensional spacetime case , it can be written in a local form by introducing two auxiliary scalar fields ( see @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "the quantum trace anomaly can give rise to macroscopic effects . to study the back reaction of the trace anomaly , one has to solve the equations of motion for these scalar fields in some curved or topological nontrivial backgrounds .",
    "it turns out that at the horizon , the quantum fluctuations of the scalar degrees of freedom world be large  @xcite .",
    "these two scalar fields are determined by boundary conditions , which brings back the non - local effect of the trace anomaly .",
    "furthermore , the equations of motion from the effective action of the trace anomaly is quite complicated , therefore in general it is impossible to obtain exact analytical solutions of einstein equations with the trace anomaly . in @xcite , with an additional assumption the authors are able to find an exact analytical black hole solution to the einstein equations with the trace anomaly .",
    "there some interesting properties of the trance anomaly corrected black hole are observed .",
    "some further discussions can be found , for example , in @xcite-@xcite .    in this note",
    "we are going to generalize the black hole solution presented in @xcite to the case with a negative cosmological constant and to study the thermodynamical properties of the trace anomaly corrected black holes in ads space .",
    "this note is organized as follows .",
    "to be self - contained , in section  [ sect2 ] we will briefly review the procedure to solve the einstein equations with the trace anomaly and present the exact analytical black hole solutions . in section  [ sect3 ]",
    "we study the thermodynamical properties of these black holes with positive , zero and negative constant curvature horizon , respectively .",
    "there we will see that the trace anomaly changes qualitatively thermodynamical properties of the black holes , compared to the case without the trace anomaly .",
    "section  [ sect4 ] is devoted to the conclusions and further discussions .",
    "in four dimensional spacetime , one loop quantum correction leads to a trace anomaly of the stress - energy tensor of conformal field theory . the trance anomaly has the form  @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are two positive constants related to the content of the conformal field theory : @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the number of scalar , dirac fermion and vector fields , respectively , in the conformal field theory .",
    "for example , for the @xmath9 @xmath10 supersymmetric yang - mills theory , one has @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the large @xmath14 limit .",
    "the first term in ( [ eq1 ] ) is called type b anomaly , while the second one is called type a anomaly  @xcite .",
    "having considered the trace anomaly , the einstein equations should be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the newton gravitational constant , @xmath17 is the cosmological constant , and @xmath18 is the corresponding stress energy tensor associated with the trace anomaly . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the case with a negative cosmological constant , @xmath19 . with only the trace ( [ eq1 ] ) ,",
    "in general it is impossible to determine all components of the stress - energy tensor associated with the trace anomaly , in the case without introducing two auxiliary scalar fields  @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors are able to obtain an exact analytical solution to the equations ( [ eq3 ] ) in the static spherically symmetric spacetime with two additional assumptions : ( i ) the stress - energy tensor is covariant conserved , namely , @xmath20 ; ( ii ) the time - time component of the stress - energy tensor and the radial - radial component are equal in the spacetime , that is , @xmath21 .",
    "the assumption ( i ) manifestly holds because the left hand side of the equations are of the same property , while the assumption ( ii ) is imposed in order to find an exact analytical solution of the einstein equations .",
    "here we would like to stress that introducing the assumption ( ii ) is just for easily solving the equations , it is not a physical requirement .",
    "we now generalize the solution presented in @xcite into the case with a cosmological constant .",
    "consider the static spherically symmetric spacetime of the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are two functions of the radial coordinate @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the line element of a two - dimensional einstein constant curvature space with scalar curvature @xmath27 . without loss of generality",
    ", one may take @xmath28 to be @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively . in that case",
    ", they correspond to a sphere , ricci flat space , and negative curvature space , respectively . according to the symmetry of metric ( [ eq4 ] )",
    ", we define @xmath32 and other components must vanish . under the assumption ( ii )",
    ", one can easily show that @xmath33 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , combining the covariant conservation of the stress - energy tensor with the trace anomaly ( [ eq1 ] ) , we have @xmath34 where we have set @xmath35 and the prime stands for the derivative with respect to the radial coordinate @xmath25 .",
    "with the assumption ( ii ) , @xmath36 , we can have from ( [ eq6 ] ) that @xmath37 this equation can be easily solved with the solution @xmath38 where @xmath39 is an integration constant .",
    "thus we are able to obtain the other nonvanishing components of the stress - energy tensor associated with the trance anomaly as @xmath40 substituting ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) into ( [ eq3 ] ) , we can obtain the solution to the einstein equations ( [ eq3 ] ) as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is an integration constant , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the solution has two branches with signs  @xmath45 \" in ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath46 , the solution reduces to @xmath47 in this case , the branch with sign  @xmath48 \" corresponds to an ads spacetime with the effective radius @xmath49 , while the branch with sign  @xmath50 \" a de sitter spacetime with effective radius @xmath51 .",
    "similar case happens in the gauss - bonnet gravity  @xcite .",
    "therefore we suspect that the solution with sign  @xmath50 \" in ( [ eq10 ] ) might be unstable .",
    "thus in the following we consider the case with sign  @xmath48 \" . in the limit @xmath52 , the solution reduces to @xmath53",
    "clearly it is nothing but the reissner - nordstrm - ads black hole solution .",
    "this suggests that the integration constant @xmath42 in ( [ eq10 ] ) is just the mass of the solution .",
    "an interesting point is that when @xmath54 , one should get the schwarzschild - ads solution for the einstein equations ( [ eq3 ] ) ; this seemingly indicates that we should take the other integration constant @xmath55 in the solution ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , however , this is not true .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the term associated with the constant @xmath56 is a ",
    "dark radiation \" one with energy density and pressure as @xmath57 .",
    "such a term obeys the assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) , and is consistent with the symmetry of the metric ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "therefore one is not able to exclude such a term in the solution in the present setup .",
    "to more clearly see the meaning of the term , one can show that if a maxwell field is present , the electric charge square @xmath58 for a static electric field will appear in the same place as @xmath59 in the solution ( [ eq10 ] )  @xcite .",
    "therefore the integration constant @xmath56 can be interpreted as a u(1 ) conserved charge of the conformal field theory which leads to the trace anomaly . however , in what follows , we will not consider the effect of the integration constant @xmath56 since it is undistinguished from the electric charge @xmath56 of the electric field .",
    "that is to say , we will set @xmath55 in the following discussions .",
    "in this section we will study the effect of the trace anomaly on the thermodynamics of the ads black holes .",
    "suppose the solution ( [ eq10 ] ) describes a black hole with horizon @xmath60 and it is asymptotically ads .",
    "one then has @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the black hole mass @xmath42 can be expressed in terms of the horizon radius as @xmath63 when @xmath64 , it reduces to the one for the schwarzschild - ads black hole .",
    "the hawking temperature of the black hole can be easily calculated with the result @xmath65 in einstein s general relativity , the bekenstein - hawking entropy of a black hole satisfies the so - called area formula : it is given by one quarter of the horizon area . in the present case , due to the presence of the trace anomaly , we do not expect that the entropy of the black hole still obeys the area formula .",
    "instead , the first law of black hole thermodynamics , @xmath66 , is always satisfied for all black holes , here @xmath67 stands for some work terms , if any .",
    "considering this fact and integrating the first law for our black hole solution , we obtain @xmath68 where @xmath69 is an integration constant . here",
    "we can not fix the constant @xmath69 by physical consideration because of the existence of the logarithmic term .",
    "the black hole entropy can also be expressed in terms of the horizon area @xmath70 as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a constant with dimension of @xmath73 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the local stability of black hole thermodynamics is determined by heat capacity of the black hole . in our case ,",
    "the heat capacity of the black hole is given by @xmath74 and the global stability of black hole thermodynamics can be checked by studying its free energy , defined as @xmath75 below we will discuss thermodynamical properties of the black hole solutions with @xmath76 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .      in this case , in order to have a positive hawking temperature , we see from ( [ eq14 ] ) that the black hole solution has a minimal horizon radius @xmath77 . as a consequence , the black hole has the minimal mass as @xmath78 when @xmath79 , the minimal mass becomes @xmath80 . for the minimal black hole ,",
    "its hawking temperature diverges .",
    "the existence of the minimal horizon radius implies that the black hole solution ( [ eq10 ] ) has a mass gap : when @xmath81 , the solution is an ads space with effective radius @xmath49 ; when @xmath82 , the solution describes an asymptotically ads black hole ; and when @xmath83 , the solution describes a naked singularity .",
    "clearly the new feature of the existence of mass gap arises totally due to the trace anomaly .",
    "in addition , let us notice that besides the singularity at @xmath84 , the solution ( [ eq10 ] ) has the other singularity at @xmath85 , where the square root in ( [ eq10 ] ) vanishes : @xmath86 one can see from ( [ eq10 ] ) that the singularity is always covered by the black hole horizon with radius @xmath60 , when the latter exists .",
    "the thermodynamic behavior of the conformal anomaly corrected black hole is qualitatively the same as the one for the schwarzschild - ads black hole , only the difference is that there does not exist the minimal horizon in the latter case . to see this",
    ", we plot the temperature of the black hole in fig .",
    "[ t_k=1 ] .",
    "note that the case with @xmath87 corresponds to the schwarzschild - ads black hole .",
    "we can see from the figure that the temperature goes to infinity as @xmath88 for small black holes with @xmath89 , while for large black holes with @xmath90 , the temperature diverges linearly with respect to @xmath60 .",
    "in addition , like the case of the schwarzschild - ads black hole , there always exists a minimal temperature for the conformal anomaly corrected black hole . under this minimal temperature",
    ", there does not exist any black hole solution .",
    "the hawking temperature of the black hole with @xmath76 .",
    "the curves from up to down correspond to the cases with @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath30 , respectively . here",
    "the horizon radius is scaled by @xmath93 , while the temperature is scaled by @xmath94 . ]",
    "the minimal temperature is determined by the divergence point of the heat capacity ( [ eq17 ] ) , where the denominator in ( [ eq17 ] ) vanishes : @xmath95 the above equation has a positive real root , which gives the black hole horizon corresponding to the minimal temperature . when @xmath96 , the solution is @xmath97 .",
    "clearly we can see from the figure that when @xmath98 , the black hole has a negative heat capacity , indicating the local instability of the black hole , while the black hole is local stable with a positive heat capacity as @xmath99 .",
    "now we turn to the global thermodynamical stability of the black hole by studying its free energy @xmath100 .",
    "our aim is to see whether the presence the logarithmic term in the black hole entropy modifies qualitatively the thermodynamical behavior of the schwarzschild - ads black hole . unfortunately due to the presence of the integration constant @xmath72",
    ", we are not able to uniquely specify the free energy . in fig .",
    "[ f_k=1 ] we plot the free energy in the case of @xmath101 ( corresponding minimal horizon radius @xmath102 ) , with three different choices of the constant @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "while the behavior of the free energy is qualitatively similar to the case of @xmath101 for other values of @xmath106 , it crucially depends on the constant @xmath72 : although the free energy is always negative for larger black holes , its behavior is qualitatively different in the region of smaller black holes .     the free energy of the black hole with @xmath76 and @xmath101 . the curves from up to down correspond to the cases with @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively . here the horizon radius is scaled by @xmath93 , while the free energy is scaled by @xmath107 . ]    for a smaller @xmath72 ( for example , @xmath103 in fig .",
    "[ f_k=1 ] ) , the free energy behaves like the one of the schwarzschild - ads black hole : for smaller black holes , the free energy is positive , which indicates the global thermodynamical instability of the black hole , while it is negative for larger black holes , and the hawking - page phase transition happens when the free energy changes its sign . for a larger @xmath72 ( for example , @xmath108 in fig .",
    "[ f_k=1 ] ) , the free energy is always negative . in that case",
    ", the hawking - page phase transition will not appear .",
    "the case with a middle @xmath72 ( for example , @xmath109 in fig .",
    "[ f_k=1 ] ) is very interesting : the free energy is negative for larger black holes and smaller black holes , but it is positive between them . in that case , there seemingly exist two hawking - page phase transitions because the free energy changes its sign twice . at the moment we are not able to figure out which case discussed above is more physical since one can not specify the constant @xmath72 .",
    "but we will have some to say on this issue in the last section of the paper .",
    "this case is much simple than the other two cases . in this case , the hawking temperature and entropy of the black hole are simply given by @xmath111 note that in this case the logarithmic term disappears in the black hole entropy and here we have fixed the integration constant @xmath112 by requiring that the black hole entropy vanishes as the horizon @xmath113 .",

    "the heat capacity is always positive while the free energy @xmath115 is always negative .",
    "the hawking - page phase transition does not appear in this case .",
    "this indicates that in this case the conformal anomaly corrected black hole is not only local stable , but also global stable thermodynamically , and the black hole phase is always dominated in the dual conformal field side .",
    "this case is very interesting as we will see . in this case , the hawking temperature is given by @xmath117 the behavior of the temperature heavily depends on the parameter @xmath118 .",
    "let us first notice that for @xmath119 , the equation ( [ eq22 ] ) has two solutions @xmath120 when @xmath121 , we have two positive real roots ( we denote the larger one by @xmath122 and smaller one by @xmath123 ) ; when @xmath124 , we have two degenerated real roots ; while as @xmath125 , we have no real roots .",
    "considering the fact that black hole temperature is always required to be positive , the above analysis tells us that when @xmath121 , the black hole has a minimal horizon given by @xmath122 , for which the black hole has a vanishing temperature .",

    "fortunately , in this case , as we have seen in fig .  [ f_k=-1,a=0.1/0.042 ] , the different choices of @xmath72 do not qualitatively change the behavior of the free energy of the black holes with @xmath116 : the hawking - page transition always appears .",
    "it should be of great interest to study the implication of the hawking - page transition in the dual conformal field theory side .",
    "finally we would like to stress the limitation and validness of the discussions in this note .",
    "black hole thermodynamics is expected to be valid when a physical scale is much larger the planck length @xmath163 ( @xmath164 ) . as we have seen , our parameter for the trace anomaly @xmath165 .",
    "therefore to see the effect of the trace anomaly on the black hole thermodynamics , it has to be assumed that @xmath166 .",
    "on the other hand , the thermodynamical feature of the schwarzschild - ads black hole is characterized by the ratio of horizon radius to the ads radius  @xcite .",
    "hence , in this paper we have introduced @xmath149 and @xmath167 to characterize the back reaction strength of the trace anomaly and the size of the black hole , respectively . as a result",
    ", we believe that with the conditions @xmath168 , @xmath169 , and @xmath170 , the thermodynamics of the trace anomaly corrected black holes makes sense in the semi - classical approximation .",
    "in addition , we point out here that the assumption ( ii ) is a strong restriction in order to find the exact analytical solution of the equations ( [ eq3 ] ) . considering the full back reaction of the trace anomaly without the restriction , the horizon geometry might be completely changed , and an interesting proposal is made in @xcite : at event horizons quantum trace anomaly can have macroscopically large back reaction effects on the geometry , potentially removing the classical event horizon of black hole , replacing black hole horizon with a quantum phase boundary layer .",
    "such a picture has important consequences on the black hole information loss paradox and currently observed dark energy in the universe .",
