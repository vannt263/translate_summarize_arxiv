    "over the last fifteen years , peer - to - peer ( p2p ) computing has become explosively popular , particularly for massive file sharing @xcite and multimedia internet streaming @xcite , whereas very high scalability has also been sought more recently in additional application domains , namely online gaming and location - aware services .    as the p2p paradigm is gaining a forefront position in distributed computing techniques @xcite ,",
    "it is important to recap good practices in p2p software system design and express them in terms of pattern language . before reviewing previous p2p pattern languages and introducing our proposal for a p2p - pl",
    ", we deem necessary to illustrate the essential properties of a p2p system .",
    "a p2p network is a complex software system whose elements ( peer nodes , or simply peers ) cooperate by partitioning tasks and workloads , in order to ensure correctness , efficiency and robustness with invariance of scale . in the most radical view of p2p computing , peers participate in the application with equal privileges .",
    "peers are said to form an overlay network of nodes , on top of the underlying computer ( typically ip ) network @xcite .",
    "such a ( well recognized ) definition implies that peers share their _ resources _ : cpu , storage , bandwidth , cache , files , applications , services .",
    "sharing implies that resources are discoverable .",
    "some peers are greedy but share a minimal quantity of resources , which is why they are denoted as _",
    "free riders_. usually , all peers implicitly provide _ basic shared resources _ ( _ e.g. _ , storage and bandwidth ) .",
    "we denote as _ consumable resources _ those that can not be obtained by replication and can only be exploited upon contracting with their hosts .",
    "usually , a limited number of peers can concurrently access the consumable resources of a peer .",
    "services are special resources that can be grouped in two categories : _ distributed services _ , whose execution involves several peers , each one contributing with its basic shared resources , and _ local services _ , which are isolated functional units allowing to access the local non - basic resources of a peer .",
    "local services may also be denoted as _ resource provision services_.    resource sharing mechanisms in p2p software systems ( p2p systems , henceforth ) can be either fully decentralized or supported by central controllers . although p2p purists only accept total decentralization , it is a matter of fact that several renowned p2p networks ( _ e.g. _ , napster , emule , bittorrent ) are based on a centralized resource index .",
    "p2p characterizing properties such as scalability and load balancing should be a consequence of proper decisions in the design of the connectivity layer , which may bring to a more or less structured overlay topology .",
    "the choice of the topology and routing strategy are often strongly interwoven .",
    "this interdependency complicates the design of efficient p2p systems .",
    "other key problems , known since the beginning of the p2p era @xcite , are bypassing firewalls and nat , attack resistance , mutual distrust and improving the motivation to cooperate .    to solve these and other issues , a suitable pattern language would greatly benefit the designer , as stated , among others , by buschmann _",
    "however , the definition of a p2p pattern language has received limited attention so far in the literature .",
    "the europlop 2002 focus group on p2p patterns @xcite discussed on the most important technical characteristics of p2p systems and on the issues related to designing and building them .",
    "although no patterns were defined , it was remarked that characterizing properties of p2p should include dynamic service relationship management , distributed state , multi - hop routing with recovery , adaptive reconfiguration , coordination and load - balancing , as well as fault - tolerance and security .",
    "alesky et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed seven well - known p2p systems to determine which design patterns are adopted",
    ". results ( summarized in table [ tab : mostusedpatterns ] ) are not surprising : creational , structural @xcite , and concurrency / networking @xcite patterns are used .",
