    "it is conceivable that the mysterious radiative stability of the hierarchy between the planck and the weak scales is imposed by the intrinsic consistency of the underlying gravitational dynamics .",
    "if so , this underlying principle should manifest itself as a consistency relation between the different scales expressed in terms of radiatively - insensitive quantities of the theory , such as , topological numbers , representations of the symmetry groups , or simply the number of species .",
    "an example of such a consistency bound , was proved recently in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that in theories with a large number @xmath0 of species with a mass scale @xmath7 , black hole ( bh ) physics imposes a relation between the planck scale ( @xmath8 ) and the mass of the species ( @xmath7 ) @xmath9 up to a factor that scales as @xmath10 at large @xmath0 .",
    "in other words , the large number of species weakens gravity by @xmath11 .",
    "= 6.5 cm    then , the following simple solution to the hierarchy problem emerges .",
    "stability of the weak scale can be explained by the fact that there are @xmath2 species beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "for instance , these new species could be @xmath0 copies of the sm , perhaps related by permutation symmetry , and only gravitationally coupled to each other .    at first sight , from a perturbative point of view",
    "it might seem mysterious what guarantees the stability of the mass of the particle species . in the present work we provide various arguments",
    "that the @xmath12species effective theory breaks down at or below the reduced scale @xmath13 that is , when the bound ( [ pm ] ) is saturated , @xmath6 approaches the mass @xmath7 of the @xmath0 species and a completion is needed right above that scale . from this point of view the fundamental scale of the theory is @xmath6 while @xmath8 is a derived quantity whose large value is due to the large multiplicity of species .    one strong indication that new gravitational dynamics should appear around the scale @xmath6 comes from the fact that the bhs of size @xmath5 , much larger than planck length , have lifetime @xmath14 so they already probe the microscopic theory of gravity .",
    "the reduced cutoff ( [ qg ] ) in particular reconciles the bound ( [ pm ] ) with naturalness arguments since in absence of tuning the perturbative renormalization of the planck mass due to the @xmath0 species with cutoff @xmath6 saturates ( [ qg ] ) .",
    "this idea was used in @xcite as a possible origin of the large value of @xmath8 .",
    "this also agrees with perturbative arguments by veneziano @xcite .",
    "the nature of the cutoff @xmath6 is not uniquely determined by the consistency of the low energy theory .",
    "one natural possibility that we investigate , is that gravity becomes strong and @xmath6 is the quantum gravity scale .",
    "this is in fact the case in the large extra dimension scenario @xcite which can be understood as a special case of our large @xmath0 theories .",
    "we focus on single - cutoff scenarios , in which @xmath6 sets a universal cutoff both for gravity as well as for the other particle species ( sm and its copies ) .",
    "the most spectacular signature of this type of models is that sm collisions at energies of order tev will produce micro bhs and the lhc will directly probe the quantum gravity regime .",
    "the micro bhs will have very peculiar features .",
    "as we will show , contrary to the naive intuition , bhs produced in particle collisions at energy @xmath6 have a slowly - fading - away memory of the particular copy of the species that produced them . as a result the bhs produced at the lhc in the collision of sm particles will predominantly decay into our sm particles and only with a strongly suppressed probability into the other copies .",
    "we propose a dynamical interpretation to this fading - away - memory in terms of slowly decaying quantum or classical hair of the black holes .",
    "this hair is not associated with any long range classical field .",
    "it either could be a hair under some discrete symmetry , or under some massive gauge fields that are associated with the given copy of species .",
    "this slowly decaying bh hair then creates a slowly fading - away memory of the site of origin in the space of species .",
    "this implies that there is some notion of locality in the space of species , although the only perturbative link between the copies is the universally coupled graviton , and the label of the copies is not necessarily a coordinate in any real space .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the argument determining the bound on the planck scale . in section 3 we discuss perturbative and non - perturbative arguments showing that some new gravitational dynamics must appear below the scale @xmath6 .",
    "section 4 contains examples of theories where the bound on @xmath8 is saturated . finally in section 5",
    "we consider the special properties of black holes in the theories with quantum gravity scale @xmath6 .",
    "we shall first briefly reproduce the main idea behind the proof of the bound of @xcite .",
    "the proof is the simplest when each sector of species has an exactly conserved quantum number .",
    "consider @xmath0 species of the quantum fields @xmath15 , of mass @xmath7 , each carrying a separately conserved @xmath16-charge .",
    "the system is invariant under an exact discrete @xmath17 symmetry , under the independent sign flips of the fields .    in order to prove the relation ( [ pm ] ) we can perform the following thought experiment .",
    "let us prepare a macroscopic bh carrying the maximal @xmath0-units of the discrete charge .",
    "this can be obtained by taking a large neutral bh and throwing one particle from each species into it .",
    "the bh prepared in such a way will carry exactly @xmath0-units of the conserved discrete charge . to avoid entering the discussions on the black hole information loss issues , it is useful to consider these @xmath16-s as the gauged discrete symmetries .",
    "as shown by krauss and wilczek @xcite , the information about the absorbed charge then can be monitored by the aharonov - bohm effect at infinity , using for example @xmath16-cosmic strings and can not be lost .",
    "because of the charge conservation , the information about the @xmath18-charge hosted by the black hole , must be revealed after its evaporation . for a black hole with hawking temperature @xmath19 ,",
    "the probability of the emission of a heavy particle of mass @xmath20 is exponentially suppressed by a boltzmann factor @xmath21 .",
    "thus , our black hole with @xmath0 units of the @xmath18-charge , can start emitting particles from the @xmath0 species , only after its temperature drops to @xmath22 . at this point",
    ", the mass of the black hole is @xmath23 .",
    "starting from this moment , the black hole can start revealing back the stored charge , in form of the @xmath0 particles species .",
    "however , by conservation of energy , the maximum number of particles that can be emitted by the black hole is @xmath24 these states should carry the same @xmath18-charge as the original @xmath0-particles .",
    "thus , @xmath25 , which proves the equation ( [ pm ] ) .    in other words , the key point of the proof , is that the amount of the maximal discrete charge which is stored in the initial black hole scales as @xmath0 , but the temperature at which the black hole starts giving back this charge essentially does not scale with @xmath0 .",
    "hence the only way to avoid inconsistency is to scale the planck mass@xmath26 as @xmath0 . with minor assumption",
    "the same conclusion holds generically in the presence of @xmath0 species .",
    "the question that we wish to answer now is what is the cutoff of the theory .",
    "we present several arguments that in the presence of @xmath0 species new gravitational dynamics must appear below the scale @xmath27 . while this holds in general , when the bh bound ( [ pm ] ) is saturated it implies that the theory must break down right above the highest mass scale of the species .      a strong non - perturbative argument supporting the claim that a gravitational cutoff should be at the scale @xmath6",
    "is provided by the fact that the lifetime of the bhs of size @xmath5 is @xmath28 .    to see this ,",
    "consider a bh with temperature @xmath29 .",
    "let us assume first that the bh does not carry the conserved charge of species number . in semi - classical approximation the decay rate of the bh is , @xmath30 using the relation between the black hole mass and the temperature @xmath31 , we can re - express this as , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the initial mass , which for the black hole of size @xmath5 is @xmath34 .",
    "this gives , @xmath35    if the bh has @xmath0 units of the conserved charge , this calculation has to be slightly modified to take into account the fact that due to the conservation of charge the number of species available for emission decreases as the bh evaporates . in this case , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of available species .",
    "going through the same steps as above one finds that the lifetime of the bh is again given by ( [ tbh ] ) .",
    "the fact that the lifetime becomes comparable to the size of the bh implies that they can not be treated as semi - classical four dimensional bhs with well - defined hawking temperature , since the temperature @xmath19 itself changes on the time - scale @xmath38 .",
    "therefore we conclude that @xmath6 determines the critical scale beyond which new gravitational dynamics must appear .",
    "we now turn to perturbative arguments ( see @xcite for related work ) . to simplify the discussion",
    "let us assume that there are @xmath0 species with mass @xmath39 which are weakly coupled .",
    "it is easy to see that the perturbation theory breaks down at the scale @xmath40 .",
    "consider the correction to the graviton propagator due to the loops of the @xmath0 particles .",
    "neglecting the index structure this is given by , @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the energy momentum tensor .",
    "the two point function of @xmath42 has uv sensitive contribution and a non - local , calculable piece associated to the production of the particles .",
    "the form of the correction can be obtained by noting that well above the mass of the particles the theory becomes approximately conformal . by conformal invariance",
    "one has , @xmath43 where the constant @xmath44 is the central charge counting the number of degrees of freedom of the theory , i.e. @xmath45 . comparing this with the tree level result",
    "one finds that the perturbative expansion fails at the scale , @xmath46 this indicates that gravitational cutoff in a theory with @xmath0 species can not be higher than @xmath47 .",
    "this result reconciles the bound on the planck mass with naturalness arguments .",
    "the perturbative renormalization of the planck mass due to the species is given by the quadratically divergent part of the two point function of @xmath42 .",
    "in absence of other contributions and assuming no cancelations , the net contribution to the planck mass is expected to be , @xmath48 with @xmath6 the cutoff , which reproduces eq . ( [ pstar ] ) .",
    "let us mention that the lowering of the cutoff due to the large number of species resembles the situation in gauge theories with positive @xmath49function .",
    "consider for example a @xmath50 gauge theory with @xmath0 flavor species . above the mass of the heaviest particle",
    "the one loop correction to the gauge coupling is given by , @xmath51 which increases the gauge coupling at short distances .",
    "the perturbative expansion goes out of control at the scale , @xmath52 this of course corresponds to the landau pole of the theory below which the effective theory must break down .",
    "in order for the effective theory to have a minimal regime of validity clearly one should have , @xmath53 so that there is a separation between the landau pole and @xmath54 . for a given @xmath55 the cutoff gets reduced ( exponentially ) as we increase the number of species .",
    "we should here note however that in the gauge theory case with a large number of colors , the correction has the opposite sign so that the coupling is reduced at short distances and the corrections can be resummed .",
    "it would interesting to see if there exists an analog in the gravity case .",
    "a hint that this must be the case is given by the fact that , while in string theory there exists an infinite tower of states , nevertheless the graviton amplitudes are manifestly soft at high energy . for ordinary matter with spin",
    "less or equal than one , it follows from unitarity that the sign of the correction always makes gravity stronger at short distances because the central charge must be positive .",
    "one possibility is that this might be violated in theories containing higher spins such as string theory .",
    "we leave this questions for future work .",
    "we would like now to show that the existence of the scale @xmath6 can also be inferred by considering the thermodynamics of the @xmath0 species .",
    "the basic idea that we want to present is that a theory with @xmath0 species , has a limiting temperature set by @xmath40 , or else it will be possible to prepare systems which violate bekenstein s entropy bound @xcite .",
    "the connection between maximal temperature and entropy bounds was also considered in @xcite",
    ". it would be also interesting to explore the connection with other entropy bounds @xcite .",
    "[ fig2 ]    let us consider the following gedanken experiment , depicted in fig .",
    "2 . take a box of size @xmath56 in which all the species are heated at temperature @xmath42 much above their mass @xmath7 so that the particles can be treated as relativistic . under the assumption that thermal distribution for all the species can be reached ,",
    "the energy stored in the box is given by , @xmath57 the size @xmath56 of the box is limited by the fact that the system will eventually collapse into a black hole .",
    "working in approximately flat space , i.e. neglecting gravity back - reaction , is justified if the schwarzchild radius of the black hole with the same energy is smaller than @xmath56 .",
    "this gives the upper bound on the size of the system , @xmath58    we can now easily find a constraint on @xmath42 .",
    "the entropy of the gas of @xmath0 relativistic species is , @xmath59 this entropy should not exceed the bekenstein s bound @xcite , @xmath60 by taking a box of maximal size ( [ maxbox ] ) one finds that for this system there exists a maximal temperature given by , @xmath61 i.e. the particles can not be heated above @xmath6 . in particular , if the hierarchy problem is explained by the large @xmath0 number of species @xmath62 , so that it is impossible to heat all the species at the temperature above their mass .",
    "it is natural to interpret the existence of this maximal temperature as a cut - off .",
    "in fact in theories with small number of species this becomes simply the statement that @xmath8 is the limiting temperature .",
    "as an example let us consider the large extra dimensions case @xcite . in this context",
    "the previous bound can be understood as follow .",
    "if we consider the higher dimensional theory with fundamental planck scale @xmath63 of order tev this is obviously the maximum temperature allowed for the system before compactification . in the experiment",
    "considered above at high temperature the size of the box ( [ maxbox ] ) is much smaller that the size of the extra - dimension so that effectively we are probing the theory in the decompactified limit . from the lower dimensional point of view the limiting temperature is simply understood as due to the collective effect of the tower of @xmath64 kaluza - klein ( kk ) states .",
    "we would like to stress however that this bound is derived in a model independent way and relies only on the assumption that the system has a fixed number of degrees of freedom .",
    "it is interesting to note that an alternative derivation of the maximal temperature can be obtained considering the following simple cosmological setup frw cosmology is applicable up to the temperature of interest . in particular",
    "this is not the case in the large extra dimension scenario where gravity becomes higher dimensional at much lower bulk temperature . ] .",
    "take an frw universe filled with @xmath0 species of mass @xmath7 or below whose temperature @xmath65 . because the temperature is below the quantum gravity scale , and species are relativistic",
    ", such universe will expand as radiation dominated frw universe with hubble parameter , @xmath66    the first immediate upper bound on @xmath42 comes from the requirement that hubble be sub - planckian , which gives @xmath67 .",
    "however a much more stringent bound arises from noticing that the temperature of the relativistic fluid becomes smaller than the horizon temperature @xmath68 at @xmath69 given by eq .",
    "( [ tmax ] )",
    ". this should be clearly impossible since the quantum fluctuations of the background will automatically increase the temperature up to @xmath68 .",
    "in this section we consider examples where the bound ( [ pm ] ) is saturated .",
    "first let us note that the black hole bound sheds a very different light on the large extra - dimension solution to the hierarchy problem . here",
    "the weakness of gravity is accounted by the large volume of the extra dimensional space , which dilutes gravity and sets the hierarchy between @xmath8 and the fundamental gravity scale @xmath6 , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the typical size of the extra - dimensions , and @xmath72 is their number .",
    "this relation acquires a very different meaning if we note that the volume of the extra space determines the number of kk species with mass @xmath6 in the following way , @xmath73 with this observation the relation between the four dimensional and high dimensional planck masses is nothing but the saturation of the bound ( [ pm ] ) ( or equivalently ( [ qg ] ) ) ! looking from this point of view , add model solves the hierarchy problem due to the fact that it includes @xmath74 kk gravitons of mass less than tev .",
    "hence , the large extra dimension scenario can be regarded as a particular example of a much larger class of models in which the hierarchy problem is solved due to large number of species .",
    "having @xmath74 copies of the sm is another example from this class , which has some advantages with respect to higher dimensional geometric picture , since one does not have to worry about the stabilization of the radius modulus .",
    "in addition the cosmological constraints become less severe , due to the fact that , unlike the production rate of kk gravitons , the production of other species is very strongly suppressed .",
    "another interesting example is provided by the randall - sundrum ( rs ) scenario @xcite .",
    "we focus for simplicity on the model with one flat brane embedded in ads@xmath75 .",
    "although this model does not solve the hierarchy problem due to the number of species , nevertheless it saturates the bound on the planck mass and the effective number of degrees of freedom of the theory . from the @xmath64 point of view the model is described by a normalizable massless @xmath64 graviton and a continuum of kk modes .",
    "the @xmath64 planck mass is given by , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the ads@xmath75 curvature and @xmath78 the @xmath79 planck scale .",
    "the physics of this model is greatly clarified by turning to the holographic description . using the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence @xcite , rs is dual to a @xmath64 strongly coupled `` large @xmath0 '' conformal field theory ( cft ) coupled to gravity @xcite .",
    "the cft is broken in the ultraviolet at a scale @xmath77 and has a central charge related given by @xmath80 .",
    "while the cft does not have particles in the usual sense , given that the central charge measures the effective number of degrees of freedom of the theory , one sees that eq .",
    "( [ mprs ] ) can be written as , @xmath81 which saturates the bound ( [ pm ] ) since the broken cft has excitations up to energy @xmath77 .",
    "it is important to clarify the nature of the cutoff in this scenario .",
    "the description of rs in terms of a cft coupled to gravity is valid up to the scale @xmath77 where the cft is broken .",
    "a possible uv completion of the broken cft is precisely given by the @xmath79 geometric setup . at energies larger than @xmath77",
    "the ads curvature becomes irrelevant and the physics turns higher dimensional .",
    "the breakdown of the perturbative expansion is then simply understood as the transition to the five dimensional regime .",
    "however in this case gravity does not become strongly coupled till the fundamental planck scale @xmath78 which one can take arbitrarily larger than @xmath77 .",
    "more speculatively it is interesting to note that the bound between the planck scale and the number of species might be saturated in perturbative string theory @xcite .",
    "generalizing the argument of @xcite one finds that in arbitrary dimensions , @xmath82 this is because the temperature of a bh of mass @xmath83 in @xmath84 dimensions is given by @xmath85 . from this",
    "it follows that the bh can at most emit @xmath86 particles of mass @xmath7 .",
    "if there are @xmath0 species with approximately conserved species number to avoid inconsistencies one finds that the planck mass has to be scaled as in ( [ bhanyd ] ) .",
    "similarly the other arguments presented in section 3 generalize to arbitrary dimension by replacing @xmath87 with @xmath88 and scaling the other dimensionfull quantities with the appropriate power .",
    "let us now consider critical string theory in @xmath89",
    ". here one finds , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the string scale and @xmath92 the string coupling .",
    "it is tempting to interpret @xmath93 as the effective number of degrees of freedom so that the @xmath94 assumes the natural value .",
    "note that this is much less than the number of string modes between the @xmath94 and @xmath91 which grows exponentially .",
    "the reduction of number of degrees of freedom has also been conjectured by atick and witten @xcite in relation to the hagedorn phase transition .",
    "the existence of a limiting temperature @xmath95 in fact also agrees with the temperature argument presented above .",
    "in the previous sections we have shown that in a theory with @xmath0 species there exists an effective cutoff in the gravity sector given by @xmath97 .",
    "one natural possibility is that @xmath6 is the quantum gravity scale .",
    "we focus here on model independent properties of black - holes in the scenarios with many species solution to the hierarchy problem in which gravity becomes strong at @xmath6 .",
    "since we assume that gravity becomes strong at the scale @xmath98 , one will start probing quantum gravity in high energy particle collisions at the tev scale . in particular",
    ", one should observe a significant production of microscopic bhs at lhc . at first sight",
    "this production leads us to a puzzle , the resolution of which provides interesting informations about the effective bh interactions in such theories .",
    "consider a process with a characteristic energy @xmath99 , in which a particle - anti - particle pair of the @xmath100th specie , is produced in the annihilation of the two sm states ( specie @xmath101 ) , via the virtual bh exchange , @xmath102 the rate of the process goes as , @xmath103 where @xmath104 are the mass scales controlling the effective bh coupling to the sm and to the other species .",
    "let us assume that @xmath104 are universally of order of some typical scale @xmath105 . to establish the bound on the scale @xmath105 we consider the total production rate in which all possible @xmath106 species are produced in the annihilation of the sm particles .",
    "assuming that the partial rates are @xmath100independent , the result is obtained by simple multiplication of ( [ rate ] ) by @xmath107 @xmath108 where we have used the fact that @xmath109 . requiring that the above rate does not violate unitarity at least until the energy @xmath110",
    ", we get the bound @xmath111 in other words , if we assume universality of the couplings , unitarity implies that the probability of production must be small in conflict with the assumption of gravity becoming strong at @xmath7 .",
    "an even more severe lower bound on @xmath105 can be derived from the following argument . because the intermediate bh is heavy , below the scale @xmath7 it can be integrated out .",
    "then , the same diagram that was generating the inter - species scattering process ( [ process ] ) , generates an effective higher dimensional operator of the form @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the energy momentum tensors of the @xmath114th specie .",
    "other structures compatible with the symmetries , e.g. , coupling between the vector or scaler currents , are of course also possible .",
    "since below the scale @xmath7 , the above interaction can be treated as a fundamental vertex , it will generate quantum corrections to the lagrangian of the sm fields .",
    "in particular there will be a significant renormalization of the kinetic terms of the sm fields from @xmath115 loops , due to their enormous multiplicity .",
    "putting aside accidental cancelations , the wave - function renormalization factor of the sm fields will scale as @xmath116 requiring these effects to be small implies @xmath117 hence , the inter - species production rate through the bh exchange would be as suppressed as the one mediated by graviton itself !",
    "the inevitable conclusion is that , either bhs should have suppressed effective couplings to all the species , or the assumption about the universality of this coupling is wrong .",
    "the former option would be inconsistent with gravity becoming strong at the scale @xmath7 .",
    "thus , we are lead to the conclusion that bh coupling can not be universal and somehow must carry a label that allows them to differentiate among the species , and predominantly decay into the specie of origin .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see that the latter possibility is compatible with the notion of strong gravity at scale @xmath7 and makes the whole picture consistent . relaxing the assumption of universality of the scale @xmath118",
    ", the total rate of production of species via bh exchange in the collision of given @xmath101-th species now becomes @xmath119 which puts a constraint @xmath120 similarly the renormalization of the sm kinetic terms now gives the bound @xmath121 both bounds are automatically satisfied and reconciled with gravity becoming strong at the scale @xmath7 , if we assume that the bh produced in the collision of @xmath101-th species decay to the same species , with the rate @xmath122 , whereas the decay rate into the other species is suppressed by @xmath123 .",
    "this means that micro bhs admit a certain notion of locality in the space of species .",
    "the locality implies that bhs are endowed with a hair , that gives them a memory of their site of origin in the space of species .",
    "this hair may not necessarily be permanent , but it has to last long enough in order to suppress the decay rate into other species .",
    "in such a case , the hair will decay after certain characteristic time , and the memory about the origin will fade away , allowing decay into foreign species .",
    "it is important to note that existence of such a hair is not in any conflict with the standard classical bh no - hair theorems @xcite .",
    "first , the hair that establishes the connection between the bh and the site of origin can be quantum - mechanical and does not need to be static .",
    "it was discovered by krauss and wilczek some time ago @xcite that bh can carry a quantum mechanical hair under discrete gauge @xmath124 symmetries .",
    "more recently , it was pointed out @xcite that in the presence of spin-2 or higher integer - spin massive fields , the black holes may be endowed with the quantum hair under these fields .",
    "moreover , the bhs themselves are not classical bhs in the sense of four dimensional gravity , since their gravitational radius is within their compton wavelength .",
    "therefore , although the bhs may appear classical from the point of view of an underlying classical theory that operates at intermediate distances larger than @xmath125 , they certainly are not classical in the usual sense .",
    "they only become classical from the point of view of @xmath64 gravity when their mass reaches @xmath8 , in which case universality of the decay is restored .    to clarify the above statements we turn once more to the large extra - dimension scenario . there",
    "the relevant scales are the radius of the extra dimensions @xmath71 , the mass of a black hole @xmath83 , the fundamental qg scale @xmath6 and the ( four - dimensional ) planck mass @xmath8 .",
    "bhs of intermediate size @xmath126 , have a size larger than @xmath127 , but smaller then the size of the extra dimension @xmath71 . while such bhs can be regarded as classical from the point of view of the high - dimensional classical gravity operating and distances @xmath128 , in no sense such objects are standard bhs from the point of view of a four - dimensional low energy observer , probing gravity with the zero mode graviton .",
    "therefore , neither four nor higher dimensional observers would be surprised to discover that such bhs are not universally coupled . and",
    "indeed , they are not",
    ". a micro bh produced in a collision on a given brane , will mostly decay into the species localized on the brane of origin and only with very suppressed probability into states localized at some @xmath129 distance away .",
    "only the very heavy bhs , with masses @xmath130 , can reach across the bulk and start decay universally .",
    "this of course agrees with the fact that these bhs are classical already in the @xmath64 description and therefore universality is guaranteed by classical bh theorems .    to conclude , while the simplest way to visualize locality is to imagine the species separated in some physical space",
    ", what we are finding is that locality in the space of species is something more general , since at no point in our discussion we have assumed the existence of underlying extra dimensions , in which the species are separated .",
