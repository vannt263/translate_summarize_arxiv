    "purely leptonic decays are the classic ways to measure the decay constants ( @xmath5 ) of charged pseudoscalar mesons @xmath6 . for the light mesons , @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    ", the muonic decays @xmath9 , @xmath10 have large branching ratios ( brs ) and so their respective decay constants have been determined with high precision @xcite ( @xmath11 ) . for the charmed pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath12 ) the brs for the purely leptonic channels are much smaller than those for the above light mesons due to the dominance of weak decay mechanism @xmath13 with a spectator quark .",
    "these smaller leptonic brs together with the lack of a dedicated charm factory has resulted in vastly inferior experimental precision for the charmed meson decay constants compared to that for @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "current measurements of @xmath16 and @xmath4 have large errors of around @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively @xcite . with the imminent ( summer 2003 ) commencement of the cleo - c experiment @xcite this situation will improve dramatically in the next @xmath19 years .",
    "precise @xmath20 measurements of @xmath16 and @xmath4 are expected and will constitute a vital test of lattice methods for the heavy quark systems , as well as providing crucial experimental input for calculations of the @xmath21 meson decay constants @xcite .",
    "however , absent in the above discussion is the fact that the leptonic decays of @xmath22 and @xmath23 might be affected by physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it is known that new charged particles which couple to the fermions would contribute at tree ",
    "level to these decays@xcite .",
    "one such example is a charged higgs boson @xmath0 , and in this paper we consider its effect on the decays @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and thus the measured value of @xmath4 .",
    "we point out that the possibility of such new physics contributions to these decays should not be overlooked when comparing the experimentally measured value of @xmath4 to the lattice qcd predictions .",
    "singly charged higgs bosons , @xmath0 , arise in any extension of the sm which contains at least two @xmath27 higgs doublets , e.g. any supersymmetric ( susy ) model .",
    "together with @xmath28 they mediate the leptonic decays @xmath29 via the annihilation process shown below :     +    ( 120,90)(0,25 ) ( 10,25)(68,25)48 ( 10,25)3 ( 10,25)(-40,55 ) ( -40,-5)(10,25 ) ( 118,-5)(68,25 ) ( 68,25)(118,55 ) ( -18,50)[]@xmath30 ( -13,0)[]@xmath31 ( 138,-2)[]@xmath32 ( 129,55)[]@xmath33 ( 41,38)[]@xmath34 ( -45,25)(33,10)(0)0.5 ( -70,25)[]@xmath35    the tree  level partial width is given by @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mass of the lepton , @xmath38 is the mass of the @xmath35 meson , @xmath39 are ckm matrix elements , and @xmath40 ^ 2= [ 1-r^2m^2_{d_q}(m_q / m_c)]^2\\ ] ] where @xmath41 in the sm , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( ratio of vacuum expectation values ) .",
    "the @xmath0 contribution interferes destructively with that of @xmath28 , causing a suppression in the br , with the largest deviations arising for large @xmath44 . for @xmath22",
    "this effect is essentially negligible ( @xmath45 ) due to the smallness of @xmath46 , but for @xmath23 the scaling factor @xmath47 may differ from 1 due to the non  negligible @xmath48 .",
    "this has been noted before @xcite , @xcite but a numerical study was absent . in light of the high precision expected in the measurement of these leptonic",
    "decays at cleo - c , we wish to quantify the previous qualitative analyses in order to see if the @xmath0 contribution can be significantly larger than the anticipated error in the measurement of br(@xmath49 ) .",
    "the current experimental measurements and the sm predictions for the three leptonic decays which cleo - c expects to measure are given in table 1 .",
    "for the sm predictions we take the lattice results @xmath50 mev and @xmath51 mev @xcite , which induces an error of around @xmath52 the brs .",
    "the measurements of the @xmath23 decays are world averages taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and that for @xmath53 is taken from ref .",
    "the expected errors from cleo - c are shown in the final column .",
    "@xmath53 & @xmath54 & @xmath55 & @xmath56 & 3.8% + @xmath1 & @xmath57 & @xmath58 & @xmath59 & 3.2% + @xmath2 & @xmath60 & @xmath61 & @xmath59 & 2.4% +",
    "we now quantify the effect of the @xmath0 contribution on @xmath47 ( eq.2 ) . for the quark masses @xmath62 and @xmath63 we use the particle data group values @xcite and obtain @xmath64 .",
    "the value of @xmath65 ) is best constrained from non  observation of the decay @xmath66 , giving @xmath67 , where the first error is from @xmath68 and the second is from possible large susy corrections @xcite .",
    "thus we take @xmath69 as our largest value .     as a function of @xmath70 , for various values of @xmath48,width=340,height=340 ]    in fig.1",
    "we plot @xmath47 as a function of @xmath44 for various values of @xmath48 . for @xmath71 one",
    "has @xmath72 for the largest ( smallest ) values of @xmath48 .",
    "this suppression is comfortably larger than the anticipated experimental error of @xmath73 ( shown by the horizontal line ) in the measurement of br@xmath74 .",
    "thus the presence of @xmath0 would lead to a deceptive smaller _ measured _ value of the decay constant @xmath4 .",
    "this effect was pointed out for the case of @xmath15 in ref  .@xcite , where br(@xmath10 ) can be suppressed by a factor comparable to that for the @xmath75 curve .",
    "although the effect of @xmath0 is less than the @xmath59 error in br(@xmath76 ) from the current lattice predictions of @xmath77@xcite , there are already signs that the error in @xmath4 will be significantly improved in the near future .",
    "a recent paper @xcite calculated @xmath4 with a precision of @xmath78 @xmath79 gev ) in the quenched approximation , while the techniques discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite promise comparable or smaller errors in the unquenched approximation . with these anticipated reductions in the theoretical error of @xmath4",
    ", we suggest that the possible effects of any @xmath0 should not be overlooked when comparing the experimentally extracted @xmath4 to the prediction from lattice qcd .    an additional observable which will also be a test of lattice qcd",
    "is the ratio of the muonic decay rates @xmath80 defined by @xmath81 the lattice prediction for @xmath82 is known with substantially greater precision than the individual values of the decay constants , and currently stands at @xmath83 for unquenched calculations and @xmath84 in the quenched approximation @xcite , i.e. an error @xmath85 .",
    "a similar ratio ( @xmath86 ) for the decays @xmath87 is also potentially an experimental observable , but is unlikely to be measured in the foreseeable future since cleo - c has limited sensitivity to @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "hence we will only consider @xmath80 , whose current sm prediction is given by @xmath89 , i.e. @xmath90 error .",
    "the current experimental measurement of @xmath91 is based on 1 event for br@xmath92 @xcite , whose central value is consistent with the old markiii limit of br@xmath93 @xcite .",
    "using the latter , a current lower bound would be @xmath94 .",
    "the first accurate measurement of @xmath95 is expected at cleo - c with an error of around @xmath96 , which is roughly the same as the error in the lattice prediction for @xmath97 .",
    "in contrast , in the case of the individual brs the current theoretical error is substantially larger than the expected experimental error .",
    "the presence of @xmath0 would modify @xmath80 by the factor @xmath47 .",
    "since the expected theoretical error in @xmath80 should approach the percent level or less , @xmath80 may also be a sensitive probe of physics beyond the sm .",
    "as an example , in susy models with @xmath44 parity violating slepton interactions , br(@xmath98 , which is essentially unaffected by @xmath0 , can be significantly suppressed or enhanced by the coupling combination @xmath99 , as discussed in ref  .@xcite .",
    "thus the presence of these couplings would give rise to a larger @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) or allow values close to the current experimental limit @xmath102 depending on the sign and magnitude of the product of @xmath44 parity violating couplings @xmath103 .",
    "thus the first measurements of @xmath95 from cleo - c are eagerly awaited .",
    "finally we note that any sizeable effects of @xmath0 on br@xmath104 ) and @xmath80 should manifest themselves in the purely leptonic @xmath105 decays , @xmath106 .",
    "this is because @xmath47 depends strongly on @xmath65 ) , whose permitted value is constrained from the upper limits on the above @xmath105 decays .",
    "the @xmath21 factories will be sensitive to @xmath107 with 400 fb@xmath108 , and thus any significant suppression in @xmath47 from @xmath0 would be accompanied by a corresponding enhancement in @xmath109 ( and @xmath110 ) .",
    "we have studied the effect of a @xmath0 on the leptonic decays @xmath111 .",
    "we showed that @xmath0 can suppress the brs by up to @xmath3 , which is larger than the expected experimental error ( @xmath73 ) from cleo - c .",
    "we suggested that new physics effects like these should not be overlooked when comparing the experimental measurements of @xmath4 to the sm lattice qcd predictions .",
