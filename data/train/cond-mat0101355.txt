    "over the past few years , manganites of the general formula re@xmath1ae@xmath2mno@xmath3 have been studied extensively@xcite . although primary interest in these compounds is motivated by the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance , understanding the physical properties even in absence of magnetic field",
    "is still far from clear . in particular , the behavior of  the resistivity ( @xmath8 ) is intriguing .",
    "the well studied la@xmath9ca@xmath10mno@xmath3 compound with hole density of n@xmath11 = 0.33 per mn exhibits a paramagnetic insulator to a ferromagnetic metal transition upon cooling from high temperature at t@xmath5 = t@xmath12 where t@xmath12 is the ferromagnetic curie temperature . for the same hole concentration ,",
    "the residual resistivity spans over six orders of magntitude and t@xmath5 shifts down , either with different choices of the rare earth ( re ) and the alkaline ( ae ) ions@xcite or by only varying their fraction as in ( la@xmath13pr@xmath14)@xmath9ca@xmath10mno@xmath3@xcite . the paramagnetic state of some other manganites like la@xmath15sr@xmath16mno@xmath3 is metallic@xcite instead of insulating .",
    "metallic like resistivity behavior ( d@xmath8/dt 0 ) in the paramagnetic state was also reported in re@xmath1ca@xmath2mno@xmath3 for x = 0.8 - 0.98 and re = pr , nd , sm , etc @xcite .",
    "charge localization due to random coulomb potential of re@xmath17 , ae@xmath18 ions and spin disorder scattering alone are inadequate to understand these results and other polaronic mechanisms involving strong electron - phonon - spin coupling have to be considered@xcite .",
    "one of the peculiar aspects of the manganites with high residual resistivity is that t@xmath5 occurs much below t@xmath12 in contradiction to the double exchange mechanism which associates the onset of metallic conduction to the ferromagnetic alignment of mn spins ( t@xmath5 = t@xmath12 ) .",
    "there are growing experimental evidences that in most , if not all of the compounds with lower t@xmath19 ( 150 k ) , insulator - metal transition is driven by percolation of  the ferromagnetic metallic clusters in either paramagnetic or charge ordered insulating background@xcite.the huge hysteresis in resistivity of these percolation driven compounds suggests that the transition is of first order .",
    "however , kinematics of the transition is largely unknown except for two cases .",
    "babushkina et al@xcite found that low the temperature zero field resistivity of ( la@xmath0nd@xmath20)@xmath15ca@xmath16mno@xmath3 thin film relaxes to lower values as a function of time .",
    "anane et al@xcite reported that the magnetic field driven metallic state of pr@xmath9ca@xmath10mno@xmath3 is unstable and the resistivity at a given temperature jumps abruptly from a low to a high value at a particular value of time after the removal of  external magnetic field .",
    "the transition in both of these compounds is of isothermal type , involving growth of ferromagnetic metallic nuclei as a function of time in a charge ordered matrix in the former compound and vice versa in the latter .",
    "it is not clear whether time dependent growth of  the low temperature phase is the general aspect of the first order transition in manganites . in this back ground",
    ", we have chosen pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mn@xmath1cr@xmath2o@xmath3 compounds which are best known for the spectacular insulator - metal transition shown by them in absence of a magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the insulator -metal transition in these compounds is due to the percolation of the ferromagnetic clusters in the charge ordered antiferromagnetic matrix and the ferromagnetic phase fraction can be controlled by changing the composition ( x ) as well as the applied field ( h ) thus allowing us to study systematically@xcite .",
    "we will report a new form ofinsulator - metal transition in this series : the insulator - metal transition is unsually unstable with respect to thermal cycling in absence and in presence of a magnetic field .",
    "we measured four probe resistivity of  polycrystalline pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mn@xmath1cr@xmath2o@xmath3 ( x = 0.015 , 0.02 , 0.025 , and 0.03 ) in absence of magnetic field and in presence of h = 2 t , and 5 t .",
    "the temperature was cycled down and up several times from the starting temperatures t@xmath21 = 350 k , 300 k , 250 k , 160 k , 100 k , 60 k to the final temperature t@xmath7 = 5 k at a constant sweep rate of 2.5 k / min .",
    "magnetization under a weak magnetic field of h = 1 mt  and also under h = 2 t were measured down and up in between t@xmath21 = 300 k , 250 k,150 k and t@xmath7 = 5 k.",
    "figure 1(a ) shows @xmath8(t ) of x = 0.015 under h = 0 t when temperature is cycled down and up from t@xmath21 = 250 k to t@xmath7 = 5 k. the number of cycles is denoted by numeric 1,2,3 etc .",
    "the sample was not taken out the cryostat prior to the completion of all the thermal cycles .",
    "after the 1@xmath22 cycle 300 k@xmath235k@xmath23300 k , t is reduced to t@xmath6 . in the 1@xmath24 cycle , @xmath8 raises rapidly around 230 k due to charge - orbital ordering and changes from insulating ( d@xmath8/dt 0 ) to metal like(d@xmath8/dt 0 ) behavior below t@xmath5 = 84 k. @xmath8(t ) is hysteretic with warming curve below and above the cooling curve for t @xmath25 t@xmath5 and  @xmath26 t@xmath5 respectively and both curves merge for t 280 k. during the 2@xmath27 cycle , t@xmath5 shifts down to 74 k and the value of  the resistivity @xmath28 at t@xmath5 increases by more than a factor of 10 . upon",
    "further thermal cycling , @xmath28 increases to @xmath29 1.95 x 10@xmath30 and t@xmath5 decreases to 45 k in the 4@xmath31 cycle and @xmath32 exceeds more than 10@xmath33 @xmath34 cm at 40 k in the 5@xmath31 and 6@xmath35 cycles .",
    "this effect is dominant only for t t@xmath5 and t close but above t@xmath5 but for t 100  k , all @xmath8(t ) curves overlap on each other .",
    "the variations of  t@xmath36 and @xmath28 with number of cycles will be presented latter in fig.3 .",
    "the so obtained insulating state is stable and does not revert to the original behavior ( 1@xmath24 cycle ) when the sample is heated to 300 k and cycled between 300 k and 5 k several times .",
    "however , if the sample is air annealed at 1273 k for five hours ,  the 1@xmath24 cycle is reproducible with identical t@xmath5 and @xmath28 .",
    "it should be mentioned that the virgin sample was originally annealed at 1773 k @xcite and annealing at 1273 k after thermal cycling is sufficient to remove any residual strain developed .",
    "we found that a shorter annealing time , for example 3 hours at 1273 k , reintroduces the insulator metal transition but with different t@xmath37 and @xmath28 .",
    "a detailed annealing time dependence of  the insulator metal transition is under investigation and will be published in future . for subsequent measurements to be rerported in this paper , we used small bars ( 3 mm x 1 mm x 1 mm ) cut from a single big virgin pellet . although the insulator - metal transition in manganites is known to be sensitive to chemical doping , pressure , magnetic field etc .",
    ", @xmath38 this is the first time that a destruction of  the insulator - metal transition just by thermal cyling is reported in manganites .",
    "our results mimics  the behavior of ( la@xmath39a@xmath14)@xmath9ca@xmath10mno@xmath3 ( y = pr , y etc ) series whose t@xmath36 decreases and @xmath28 increases with increasing  content of smaller y rare earth ions@xcite .",
    "the observed effect is strongly dependent on the composition and decreases with increasing x. fig .",
    "1(b ) shows @xmath8 of x = 0.02 .",
    "this compound exhibits higher t@xmath5 (= 120 k while cooling ) and nearly ten times lower @xmath40 (= 4.8 @xmath34 cm while cooling ) than x = 0.015 ( t@xmath5 = 84 k and @xmath28 = 136 @xmath34 cm while cooling ) .",
    "there is a systematic trend in the behavior of @xmath28 ( warm ) and t@xmath5 ( warm ) with increasing the number of cycles : @xmath28(warm ) is comparable to @xmath41(cool ) in the 2@xmath27 cycles but becomes much lower than cooling  as the number of cycles increases .",
    "the weak shoulder in @xmath8(warm ) which develops around 105 k  in the 3@xmath42 cycle becomes a prominent maximum in the 10@xmath31 cycle .",
    "as for x = 0.015 , resistivity curves in different cycles overlap on each other for t t@xmath5 . compared to variations by several orders of magnitude in @xmath28 ( cool ) for x = 0.015 , @xmath28 ( cool )",
    "changes only by a factor of  5 in x = 0.02 ,  even in 10@xmath31 cycle and by less than a factor of 0.8 in x = 0.03 ( see fig .",
    "the resistivity of x @xmath43 0.03 is unaffected by thermal cycling ( not shown here ) .",
    "1(d ) shows @xmath8(t ) of x = 0.015 under h = 2 t. we can clearly see the increase of the resistivity with increasing the number of cycles and the insulator - metal transition is abruptly lost in 8@xmath31 cycle . a comparison  of fig .",
    "1(a ) and 1(d ) suggests that it is impossible to predict what should be the value of residual or peak resistivity before the sample loses metallic behavior . in the rest of the paper we focus on x = 0.015 which shows the most dramatic effect .",
    "we also investigated  whether the observed effect in x = 0.015 is dependent on the starting temperature t@xmath21 .",
    "the resistivity curves for t@xmath21 = 350 k , 300 k , and 200 k are identical to the data for t@xmath21 = 250 k and hence we do not present them here for the lack of space . the main panel of fig .",
    "2(a ) shows @xmath8(t ) for t@xmath21 = 100 k and the inset shows data for t@xmath21 = 160 k. the value of @xmath28  in the 5@xmath31 cycle decreases from @xmath293 x 10@xmath44 @xmath34 cm for t@xmath21 = 160 k to @xmath29575 @xmath34 cm for t@xmath21= 100 k and for t@xmath21 = 60 k ( not shown here ) whereas @xmath8 increases by less than a factor of 1.2 .",
    "these results point to the fact that the number of cycles needed to destroy insulator - metal transition increases with lowering temperature below 200 k. instead of varying t@xmath21 , we also investigated the effect of varying t@xmath7 .",
    "2(b ) shows @xmath8(t ) for x = 0.015 with t@xmath21 = 250 k but t@xmath7 decreasing from 100 k to 10 k instep of 10 k. in none of the cycles , transition to metallic state is realized .",
    "3 summarizes the variation of t@xmath5 and @xmath28 with the number of cycles and t@xmath21 for x = 0.015 in presence and absence of magnetic field .",
    "a doubt could be raised whether the increase of @xmath8 is caused by the elapse of time during thermal cycling . to verify this point we measured time dependence of the resistivity at 60 k  in different cycles on a sample not submitted to thermal cycling earlier .",
    "the result presented in the inset of fig .",
    "2(a ) in a normalized form ( @xmath8(t)/@xmath8(t = 0 ) , where @xmath8(t ) is the resistivity after t seconds ) clearly suggests that @xmath8 decreases with time as found by kimura et al@xcite . in nd@xmath0ca@xmath0mn@xmath45cr@xmath46o@xmath3 .",
    "this confirms that the observed increase of the resistivity is purely a temperature driven effect .",
    "thus , two different antagonist mechanisms seems to act in thermal cycling and isothermal aging effects .",
    "the isothermal aging effect is possibly caused by growth of ferromagnetic clusters in size with time@xcite .",
    "to understand the origin of  the unstable i -m transition induced by thermal cycling , we carried out magnetization measurements .",
    "the main panel of fig .",
    "4(a ) shows m(t ) of x = 0.015 under h = 1 mt for t@xmath21 = 250 k. the peak around 230 k is caused by charge - orbital ordering . upon lowering temperature further ferromagnetic clusters form below 150 k. charges are itinerant within these clusters by double exchange mechanism but the resistivity does not decrease as these clusters are isolated . as t decreases further intercluster interactions increase and  when",
    "a percolating path between ferromagnetic clusters is established around 84 k , @xmath8(t ) decreases as in fig .",
    "4(a ) clearly shows that the ferromagnetic transition broadens in temperature and its phase fraction decreases each time with temperature cycling .",
    "interestingly , m decreases by about 30 % between the first two cycles  but the overal change between the 1@xmath24 and 5@xmath31 cycles is only of about 46 % .",
    "it should be noted that m does not go to zero in the 5@xmath31 cycle whereas metallic behavior is lost in resistivity ( see fig .",
    "1(a ) ) . when t@xmath21 = 160 k , the overall decrease between the 1@xmath24 and 5@xmath31 cycles is only 19 % , ( see inset of fig .",
    "4(a ) ) .    fig .",
    "4(b ) shows m(t ) measured under a field of 2 t  in the field cooled mode and the inset shows m(h ) at 10 k made under zero field cooled mode .",
    "m(h ) in the 1@xmath24 cycle ( see inset in fig .",
    "4(b ) ) shows a two phase behavior , one due to gradual alignment of ferromagnetic clusters in the field direction below 1.5 t and another due to field induced canting of spins in antiferromagnetic background above 1.5 t. the observed total magnetization is m@xmath47 = f@xmath48m@xmath49+(1-f@xmath48)m@xmath50 where f@xmath51 and 1-f@xmath48 are the volume fractions of  the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic phases with saturation magnetic moments m@xmath49 and m@xmath52 respectivly .",
    "the spin only saturation moment of the mn site cation is 3.485 @xmath53 if spins of cr@xmath17,mn@xmath17 , mn@xmath54 ions are parallel and 3.395 @xmath53 if the moment of cr@xmath17 ion is reversed as suggested earlier@xcite .",
    "assuming that the magnetization of the ferromagnetic phase completely saturates at 1.5 t , and the field induced canting of antiferromagnetic moment is negligible below this field , we can estimate the ferromagnetic phase fraction f@xmath48 = m@xmath47/m@xmath49 = 0.582/3.485 = 16.7 % .which is slightly above the percolation limit of p@xmath5514.5 % in the continuum model@xcite . in the 8@xmath31 cycle , f@xmath48 decreases to 8.4 % .",
    "( m@xmath47/m@xmath49 = 0.2938/3.485 = 8.4 % ) .",
    "the values of f@xmath48 are 17.2 % in the 1@xmath24 cycle and 8.6 % if we take m@xmath49 = 3.395@xmath53 . as a consequence of the decrease of f@xmath56",
    ", percolation is lost and so is the metallic character of the resistivity at low temperatures . including a finite value for m@xmath50 due to canting at 1.5 t could modify the actual value of f@xmath48 , but the decrease of the ferromagnetic phase fraction is still undisputable .    when the sample is field cooled under h = 2 t ( main panel of fig .",
    "4(b ) ) , the ferromagnetic phase fraction is 19.6 % and it reduces to 14.2 % ( @xmath57 p@xmath58 ) in the 8@xmath31 cycle when the sample becomes insulator .",
    "these results clearly suggest that the increase of resistivity is related to the decrease of the ferromagnetic phase fraction .",
    "since f@xmath48 increases with lowering t below @xmath59150 k in the 1@xmath24cycle , the effect of thermal cycling upon the increase of resistivity also decreases with t@xmath21 , lowering below 160 k.    at this moment a doubt could be raised : is the decrease of m due to random freezing of  moments of ferromagnetic clusters by local anisotroy fields instead of change in the ferromagnetic phase fraction ? .",
    "if cluster freezing is the dominant mechanism , the anisotropy energy is expected to increase in conjunction with the increase in resistivity and we can anticipate the maximum in  the zero field cooled magnetization ( zfc ) to shift up in the temperature with cycling@xcite . to verify this point we carried out the zfc -m(t ) in h = 1 mt and h = 2 t.  fig .",
    "5(a ) shows  m(t ) under h = 1 mt in the zfc mode after cooling the sample in zero field from 250k to 10 k each time .",
    "the data were taken over a smaller temperature range compared to fig .",
    "4(a ) but it serves our purpose . in the first cycle , m(t ) increases smoothly from 10 k and exhibits a maximum around 57 k. however , in the second cycle m(t ) decreases dramatically in value the temperature range 20 k-110 k and in the next two cycles the change is rather small . the dramatic decrease of m value in the 2@xmath27 cycle",
    "is not expected  in a conventional cluster or spin glass@xcite we do not observe the anticipated upward shift of the maximum instead , the zfc - m(t ) curves in the second , third , and fourth cycles show a maximum at t @xmath29 30 k. fig .",
    "5(b ) shows m(t ) under h = 2 t in the zfc mode .",
    "all the curves again exhibit a maximum at the same temperature ( t = 30 k ) which also allows us to conclude that cluster freezing is not the dominant mechanism in reducing the value of the magnetization , but that the decrease in the ferromagnetic phase fraction is the the possible origin .    what could be the mechanism which drives the diminution of the ferromagnetic phase ?",
    "the ferromagnetic metallic ( fmm ) and the charge ordered insulating ( coi ) phases are expected to differ structurally because of  the larger degree of janh - teller distortion in the latter phase and its absence in the former phase . then",
    ", inhomogeneous strains exist in the interfacial regions . in  a first order transition",
    "in which elastic interactions between the parent and the product phases are non negligible ( example martensitic transition@xcite ) , growth of  the product phase does not progress as a function of time as one would expect , but needs changes in the thermal energy .",
    "the rapid decrease in the magnetization between the first two cycles and the gradual decrease in the later cycles resemble the evolution of strain in the first few thermal cycles ( known also as training ) in athermal martensitic materials@xcite . in charge",
    "ordered phase , d@xmath60 orbital ordering due to the jahn - teller distortion creates anisotropic strain .",
    "we observed changes neither in intensity nor in the value of the charge - orbital modulation vector * q * by electron microscopy at 92 k under thermal cycling ( not shown here ) , however we can not exclude possible changes in the interfacial regions .",
    "we also carried out an x - ray diffraction study at t = 300 k and at t = 100 k which is the lowest temperature limit in our x - ray instrument ( philips- xpert ) on a piece of a virgin sample and on a sample which has become an insulator after thermal cycling .",
    "we carried out the rietveld analysis in _ pbmn _ settings .",
    "the results are presented in tables i and ii . although we find changes in the structural parameters between the two samples , errors in the parameters ( see the numbers within brackets ) are too large to be reliable .",
    "it is possible that structural changes occur mostly in the interfacial regions between the ferromagnetic and the charge ordered phase which could not be detected in the present x - ray study  due to smaller width of the interfacial regions .",
    "millis et al@xcite showed that biaxial strain due to the jahn - teller distortion could lead to localization of charges and decrease  the curie temperature .",
    "then , a plausible explanation is that upon thermal cycling the jahn - teller distortion of  mn@xmath17o@xmath61 octahedras in the interfacial regions increases;as a result the interfacial elastic energy increases which impedes the growth of the ferromagnetic phase during thermal cycling similar to the martensitic transition@xcite .",
    "we do not think that granularity effects play any important role in our results since we find a systematics in the behavior of  the thermal cycling effect with different x although all the compounds were prepared under identical conditions .",
    "very recently , similar thermal cycling induced phenomena but less dramatic effect than our results was also reported  in gd@xmath62(si@xmath63ge@xmath64)@xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown for the first time that the insulator - metal transition in the phase separated pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mn@xmath1cr@xmath2o@xmath65 manganites is unstable with respect to thermal cycling . while the resistivity much above the i - m temperature is found to be unaffected , the resistivity close and below the i - m transition is strongly affected by repeated thermal cycling .",
    "repeated thermal cycling is found to increase the low temperature resistivity and even destroys the metallic transition in x = 0.015 .",
    "the effect is strongly dependent on the composition and decreases with increasing x. we have shown that the ferromagnetic phase fraction decreases with repeated thermal cycling .",
    "our x - ray and electron diffraction studies do not show any clear evidence for change in structural parameters of the bulk , although changes in interfacial regions can not be excluded.we suggest that increase ofthe elastic energy in the ferromagnetic - charge ordered interface might be the origin of the instability of the i - m transition .",
    "in contrary  to the thermal cycling effect , resistivity at a given temperature is found to decrease slowly as a function of time .",
    "further experimental and theoretical studies are necessary to clarify the origin of the observed effects .",
    "it is also worth to investigate whether the observed effect is restricted to only cr - doped charge ordered manganite or is is the generic behavior of the manganites for certain doping levels .",
