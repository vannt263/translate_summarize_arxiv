    "supernova data suggest that most of the energy in the universe is unknown to us ( @xcite ) . much theoretical effort has been devoted to exploring",
    "the possible candidates for the dark energy ( for example , see @xcite ) , and investigating the constraints on the nature of the dark energy that can be derived from observational data ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "the most straightforward and promising probe of dark energy is the distance - redshift relation derived from observations of cosmological standard candles . at present , type ia supernovae ( sne ia )",
    "are our best candidates for cosmological standard candles ( @xcite ) .",
    "most workers have concentrated on constraining the equation of state of the dark energy @xmath11 from sn data . however , without making specific assumptions about @xmath11 ( for example , assuming it to be a constant ) , it is extremely hard to constrain @xmath11 using sn data ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , wang and garnavich ( 2001 ) [ wg01 ] showed that it is easier to extract constraints on the dark energy density @xmath0 , instead of @xmath12 , from data .",
    "this is because there are multiple integrals relating @xmath12 to the luminosity distance of sne ia , @xmath13 , which results in a `` smearing '' that obscures the difference between different @xmath12 ( @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath0 is related to the time derivative of the comoving distance to sne ia , @xmath14 ; hence it is less affected by the smearing effect .",
    "the advantage of measuring @xmath0 over that of measuring @xmath12 is confirmed by tegmark ( 2001 ) .",
    "wg01 gave a proof of principle of an adaptive iteration technique for extracting the dimensionless dark energy density @xmath1 as an arbitrary function from future sn data .",
    "they found that feasible future sn data will allow us to clearly differentiate dark energy with density that changes with time from a cosmological constant @xmath15 ; however , estimates of @xmath3 and @xmath2 tend to be significantly biased for dark energy densities that vary substantially with time .    in this paper",
    ", we apply a significantly improved and optimized version of the adaptive iteration technique for obtaining an unbiased estimate of the dark energy density from sn ia data .",

    "following wg01 , we impose the weak energy condition ( the energy density is nonnegative for any observer [ @xcite ] ) , which implies that @xmath19 ( see wg01 ) .",
    "the equation of state of the dark energy is w_x(z ) = ( 1+z ) -1 .",

    "let us combine the data from the sn pencil beam survey with sn data at smaller redshifts , so that there are a minimum of 50 sne ia per 0.1 redshift interval at any redshift .",
