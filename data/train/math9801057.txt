    "let us assume in the following that the underlying state variables whose values determine the value of an option at exercise dates follow a known stochastic process .",
    "generally , a stochastic process is specified by defining the state space , an index parameter ( usually the time ) and the dependence relation between the random variables . the latter is usually given in terms of a stochastic integro - differential equation containing some deterministic drift terms and random changes in addition , notably diffusion or jump processes .",
    "memory or so - called non - markov effects may readily be included into the transition probabilities .",
    "non - markov models have found recently considerable interest in the finance community , because the heath , jarrow and morton ( 1992 ) approach to interest rate evolution can be shown to possess non - markovian features , in general .",
    "we assume ` smoothness ' for the transition probability density function which determines the probabilities  based on a path s evolution history  that the path will comes close to any element of the state space at some time in the future .",
    "these are supposed to be continuous functions of the path variables . a discrete set of sequentially selected random points in time",
    "is often called a  chain \" .",
    "a path is the corresponding generalization for a continuous time evolution .    at first",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to options and stochastic processes which result in the following simple property of the yes - no boundary :    *  the _ boundary _ between yes and no regions at any given decision time @xmath20 is a simply connected hypersurface in the state space with dimension of one unit less than the dimension of the state space . \"    as a consequence of the assumption , there are no disconnected pieces of yes or no regions at a given time either . with the exception of some pathological cases , assumption a1",
    "will be compatible only with option payoffs contingent on the values of the state variables at exercise date . instead of specifying these pathological stochastic processes",
    "we simply require here :    *  the payoff from exercising an option is only a function of the state variables at the exercise date but not at earlier times , i.e. @xmath21 . \"    in general , the topology of exercise and hold regions of american options may be more complicated than allowed by our assumptions .",
    "two examples are some types of barrier options and path - dependent options .",
    "suppose the owner of a barrier option receives only some payoff if a security stays within some specified range of values at exercise date .",
    "therefore the option will not be exercised for ` too small ' and ` too large ' values of the underlying which leads to two disconnected no regions .",
    "another perhaps more interesting example of options not covered by the assumption stated above are american path - dependent options whose valuation we will return to later in this section . here the payoff depends on the values which the underlying state variables have taken in the past , e.g.  on the arithmetic mean within some time interval . projected into the space of state variables at any given time yes and no region are completely scrambled .",
    "it may be optimal to exercise or hold an option for the _ same _ present value of the state variables @xmath2 depending on the different histories of each path .",
    "lateron , we will show that a redefinition of the state space enables us to cover the case of path - dependent options by the same algorithm .",
    "we should also mention that the assumption a2 restricts the memory properties of the underlying stochastic process .",
    "they should not spoil the assumed property of the yes - no boundary in the state space .",
    "this simply means that although the future evolution of each path may depend on the past , the ` average outcome ' determining the decision whether to exercise the option at present time is not influenced by the past but of markovian nature .",
    "assumption a1 allows us to define coordinates in the @xmath22 dimensional state space such that any element @xmath2 of the state space can be uniquely characterized by some point of the yes - no boundary @xmath23 and an additional coordinate @xmath24 @xmath25 in a peculiar way . for any path passing through @xmath2 at present time",
    "the following inequalities hold between the payoff from exercising the option @xmath26 and the option value @xmath27 if the option is being held at least until the next exercise date : @xmath28 the content of eq .",
    "( [ eq_coord ] ) is to provide convenient coordinates from which one can easily read off whether point @xmath2 is a boundary point ( @xmath29 ) , in the yes ( @xmath30 ) or in the no ( @xmath31 ) region .",
    "the knowledge of all @xmath24 or just their signs is tantamount to finding the yes - no boundary itself .",
    "unfortunately , a straightforward application of the inequalities as expressed in eq .",
    "( [ eq_coord ] ) to determine the boundary is prohibitive . estimating the expected payoff from holding the option and comparing it to the payoff from exercising would require a ` new simulation within the simulation ' .",
    "such a procedure becomes numerically awkward and would severely restrict the complexity of the problem to be tackled , concerning e.g.   the nature of the stochastic process and the number of exercise dates .",
    "we will proceed now to estimate the location of the yes - no boundary based on a set of sampled paths . for this purpose",
    "it will be necessary to evolve the state variables backward in time .",
    "this feature of the novel monte carlo approach which it shares with all other numerical approaches to option pricing like the binomial tree method is caused by the boundary conditions of the problem .",
    "the option price is a specified function of the state variables only on the expiration date .",
    "of course , the location of the yes - no boundary is also trivially determined at expiration time . for a simple call or put option on a single asset it is the point @xmath32 .",
    "the continuous time process will be presented as a sequence of time steps @xmath33 which add up to the lifetime of the contract @xmath34 .",
    "the time steps are supposed to match the distance between decision times exactly if a finite number of exercise opportunities has been specified in the option contract . for american options which give the owner the right of exercise at any time this is an approximation . however , choosing ` small ' time steps @xmath35 the results will be close to the continuum limit .",
    "the current time @xmath3 for which the location of the yes - no boundary is being sought can be represented by the integer index @xmath36 ( with @xmath37 for american options ) .",
    "since the location of the yes - no boundary will be determined step by step moving backward in time , it is implicitly assumed from now on that the yes - no boundary has already been determined for later times @xmath36 + 1,@xmath36 + 2,  ,@xmath38 ( within the usual uncertainties due to the numerical imprecision ) .",

    "( for the latter case @xmath43=0 , of course . )",
    "we have used the subscript @xmath44 for the argument @xmath18 of @xmath45 to emphasize that the payoff defined above depends only on the values of the path variables for times @xmath46 but not on the past evolution of the state .",

    "next we define a continuous path @xmath53 in the state space by letting @xmath54 be a continuous parameter within some range such that all @xmath55 are elements of the state space and vice versa .",

    "it is clear that our ability to define such a function has important repercussions for the question how to _ find _ the yes - no boundary .",
    "the virtue of path @xmath53 is to provide us with the knowledge that it has exactly one intersection point with the yes - no boundary .",

    "( it will not hurt the search procedure , if we accidentally hit the boundary several times reflected by several local maxima . )",
    "it is also rather straightforward to determine selected points which are in either the yes or the no region for sure .",
    "for instance , points lie in the no region if the payoff from exercising is zero . or the point with zero value of the underlying is certainly an element of the yes region for a plain vanilla put , because the payoff can not get any better .    in order to proceed with the proof of our conjecture we define a  generally suboptimal  exercise policy for all paths intersecting with @xmath53 at time @xmath3 which depends on an arbitrary point @xmath59 .",
    "we define a preliminary `` yes '' region ( with the quotation marks reminding us that the true yes boundary may be different ) as to cover all paths with state variable @xmath60 which fulfill @xmath61 . for instance , in case of a plain vanilla put ( call ) option on a single underlying asset we may declare that @xmath62 lies in the `` yes '' region if it fulfills the condition @xmath63(@xmath64  @xmath65 .",

    "the global maximum of function @xmath86 along each line is the supposed intersection point with the yes - no boundary .",
    "this process may be iterated until the desired precision is reached .",
    "this standard optimization procedure becomes particularly simple in case of plain vanilla options .",

    "the presented optimization technique may be used in the problem of valuation of american _ path - dependent _ options as well . here the payoff from exercising the option depends on some function of the state variables in the past which we will denote as @xmath87 in the following .",

    ", we restrict ourselves here to stochastic processes of markovian nature whose parameters have been specified . in this case",
    "the exercise decision at any time before expiry is a function of just two  each possibly vector - valued  variables , the values of the state variables and of the path - dependent variable @xmath87 , both taken at the decision time .",
    "the difference between standard path - dependent and plain vanilla options is just that the role of the current value of the underlying variable in plain - vanilla contracts is played by @xmath87 in path - dependent contracts , e.g.  max@xmath88 for a put .",
    "the topology of the exercise region for this kind of path - dependent options is very simple but only in the space of state variables _ enlarged by the additional dimension(s ) of @xmath87 _ .",
    "the yes - no boundary in the @xmath2-@xmath87 space is again simply connected .",
    "only its projection into the @xmath2 space leads to a scrambling of yes and no regions .",
    "this suggests immediately how the suggested optimization technique may be applied for the case of these path - dependent options .",
    "we equip the space of states with additional dimensions by declaring @xmath87 to be one of the stochastic variables .",
    "of course , the stochastic character of this variable is rather funny .",
    "its change with time is completely deterministic and of non - markovian type .",
    "however , these features are in accordance with the basic assumptions entering into the proof of proposition p1 . the complications of such path - dependent option contracts just result in a higher dimension of the space in which we have to track the yes - no boundary .",
    "we are now in a position to compare our novel strategy for an extraction of american - style option prices from monte carlo simulation to previously suggested ones .",
    "boyle , broadie , and glassermann discuss mainly three strategies in their review paper to overcome the inherent limitations of the naive monte carlo procedure : the bundling algorithm invented by tilley ( 1993 ) , the stratified state aggregation algorithm suggested by barraquand and martineau ( 1995 ) and broadie and glassermann s ( 1995 ) algorithm based on simulated trees . in tilley s",
    "approach bundles of paths which are ` close ' in state space at given time are considered to emanate from one single point for the purpose of option valuation .",
    "this introduces some error whose magnitude can not be easily controled .",
    "the bias of the exercise decision will be very strong if a bundle contains only few paths .",
    "such a situation is likely to emerge in situations in which there are many exercise dates or several state variables .",
    "barraquand and martineau introduce another type of ` bundling ' , however , in the payoff space .",
    "our approach shares similarities with tilley s algorithm in the sense that it contains an implicit ` bundling ' of paths ( called ` binning ' ) in the proof of the proposition p1 .",
    "however , we have actually never to carry out this bundling in a numerical calculation , because we stick to an optimization of the ` inclusive ' function @xmath89 which sums up all bins .",
    "broadie and glassermann proposed an algorithm based on a ` bushy tree ' structure in state space which avoids partitioning of the state or payoff space . in their model",
    "many branches emanate from each node .",
    "this process is replicated as often as there are decision times @xmath90 in the problem .",
    "the replication process effectively limits @xmath90 to small numbers ( on the order of 4 ) in practical computations .",
    "they also discuss the problem that the suggested estimators of the option prices tend to be biased in ` up ' or ` down ' direction . and converge only to the correct value in the limit @xmath56 .",
    "this problem is of great relevance for practical calculations ( which are always at finite @xmath1 ) .",
    "they use the idea to calculate two estimators  one biased low and the other high  to obtain confidence limits from the simulations .",
    "lateron , we are going to apply this idea in the framework of our approach .",
    "in this paper we will only consider stochastic processes of rather simple nature , so - called ideal wiener or diffusion processes ( for the @xmath91 of any state variables ) . in physics these processes",
    "are usually called brownian motion .",
    "such processes seem to be most commonly used in valuation problems .",
    "furthermore , numerical techniques have been developed to calculate prices for plain vanilla and other simple types of american options .",
    "in particular , the binomial tree method may provide very accurate values and will be used as a benchmark here against which the results from the monte carlo simulations are being tested . in this section",
    "we will restrict ourselves to _ puts _ on the current value and on the  geometric or arithmetic  average of one single underlying security .",
    "an ideal wiener process can be characterized by the differential transition law @xmath92 governing the change of the state variable @xmath93 within a time interval @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath95 is a random number drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 .",
    "@xmath96 is in general the drift velocity which may be replaced by the risk - free instantaneous interest rate @xmath13 using arbitrage arguments .",
    "sometimes one needs to follow an ideal wiener process only _ backward _ in time , e.g.  in case of monte carlo estimation of plain vanilla options . using the _ bridge _ construction  start @xmath97 and final value @xmath98 are known  a random value at intermediate time may be chosen according to @xmath99 after having fixed final and start values , iterative use of eq .",
    "( [ eq_wiener_bw ] ) may be employed to generate a time reverted copy of the standard diffusive wiener - type motion . for the simulation results presented below",
    "we have used a simple importance sampling scheme .",
    "the exercise value of strongly out - of - the money options at expiry will be zero on most paths .",
    "therefore the weight of the rare paths resulting in nonzero option value has been artificially enhanced in the path generation process . of course , the enhancement factors are taken out again in the calculation of the path - averaged prices .    in its most simple form",
    "the monte carlo algorithm which is suitable for valuation of american - style options consists of the following steps :    ( 1 ) : :    generate path sample .",
    "( 2 ) : :    go step - by - step backward in time starting at expiry . ( 3 ) : :    track the yes - no boundary by employing the optimization of function    @xmath86 along arbitrary paths connecting    yes and no region ( cf .",

    "( 4 ) : :    evaluate the pathwise payoffs at the earlier time analogous to    eq .",

    "( 5 ) : :    repeat the process until the contract time is reached . ( 6 ) : :    average the pathwise payoffs discounted to initial time over the whole    path sample ( cf .",
    "( [ eq_amopt_mc ] ) ) .",
    "let us discuss now some aspects related to the _ finite _ size of the path sample in practical calculations .",
    "it is clear that step * ( 6 ) * does not provide an unbiased estimator of the option price at any finite @xmath1 but is biased upward .",
    "the reason is that an error is made extracting the yes - no boundary from the finite size path sample .",
    "a deviation of the extracted from the true boundary has its root in the information about the mismatch between frequency distribution of the @xmath1 paths and underlying probabilities which enters into the optimization process .",
    "the estimator becomes only asymptotically unbiased .",
    "since we are not able to construct an unbiased estimator , we may get an estimate of the error introduced by the bias in step * ( 6 ) * by constructing an estimator which is downward biased at finite @xmath1 but also asymptotically unbiased .",
    "it is very simple to construct such an estimator :    ( 6 ) : :    generate a path sample independent from the first one and evaluate the    american option prices using the previously calculated yes - no    boundary .",
    "the reason that the prices calculated from this path sample are biased downward mirrors the one for the upward bias in the former case . here",
    "any deviation from the true boundary implies a suboptimal exercise policy .",
    "we hasten to add that the algorithm presented so far has one shortcoming related to the combined effects of finite sample size @xmath1 and well - determined values of the underlying variables at start time . only with paths crossing the yes - no boundary",
    "its optimal location can be determined , of course .",
    "formally , the proof of proposition p1 requires that the probability densities appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq_optim_cont ] ) be positive - definite in a region covering the yes - no boundary .",
    "however , this condition will be violated in practice at early times , since all sampled paths emanate from a common starting point . on the other side , in such a situation",
    "the knowledge of the precise location of the boundary becomes irrelevant for the valuation problem .",
    "it suffices to know at this stage on which side of the boundary the vast majority of paths can be found .",
    "two variants with differing degree of sophistication have been developed to determine the earliest time for which the algorithm above is to be used :    ( 7a ) : :    if the yes - no boundary gets closest to either one of the endpoints of    @xmath53 , e.g.   the paths with smallest or largest    @xmath2 value for plain vanilla options , it is assumed that    the boundary can be found outside the range of the path sample for all    earlier times .",
    "( 7b ) : :    `` flashlight mechanism '' : when the yes - no boundary moves towards a    region only poorly covered by the original path sample , additional    path segments are created which evolve in the region of the yes - no    boundary at this time .",
    "as far as the proof of proposition p1 is    concerned the probability densities in eq .",
    "( [ eq_optim_cont ] ) do _ not _    need to be consistent with the initial value specification for the    pricing problem . here",
    "we make use of this freedom to generate a set of    paths whose initial values are tuned to ` shed light ' on the location    of the yes - no boundary .",
    "concerning accuracy simulation mode * ( 7b ) * is only barely noticably superior over mode * ( 7a ) * for the tested sample of plain vanilla options .",
    "all simulation results for more complicated options reported on in this paper have been achieved employing mode * ( 7b ) * .    at",
    "finite @xmath1 the values and therefore also the maximum of the payoff function @xmath86 do not change between values of its argument which are taken by two neighboring paths . furthermore",
    ", the precision with which the true maximum of function @xmath100 can be estimated from a finite size sample is a multiple ( @xmath101 ) of the typical distance between paths in the region along the yes - no boundary .",
    "[ fig_1 ] shows the monte carlo estimation of the optimization function @xmath70 for a plain vanilla put option on a security of ( time - dependent ) value @xmath102 in order to illustrate the finite @xmath1 effect .",
    "selected @xmath70 values are displayed at a fixed time but varying the size of the path sample .",
    "the true minimum is quite shallow for the selected time as can be seen from the figure .",
    "the shallowness is related to the strong time dependence of the location of the yes - no boundary , because we consider a time shortly before expiry .",
    "the location of the maximum can be reliably extracted from the simulations only for rather large samples on the order of @xmath103 paths .",
    "one may ask whether in view of the imprecisions associated with any finite sample size it is worthwile to search for the exact maximum of @xmath70 .",
    "in fact , a well - chosen ` smoothing ' procedure which subtracts the white random noise may give more accurate results than taking the real maximum of @xmath70 as a boundary point .",
    "for this paper we compared two variants how to determine the yes - no boundary points :    ( 3a ) : :    determine the yes - no boundary point as the element of the set of all    intersection points @xmath62 of the sampled paths with    path @xmath53 for which @xmath104 restricted    to these points attains a maximum value    @xmath105 .",

    "it requires a number of operations growing only linearly with @xmath1 while variant * ( 3a ) * needs at least on the order of @xmath108 operations .",

    "in addition , the figures display the distribution of the differences between monte carlo values based on the original and the independent path sample .",

    "[ fig_2 ] ) . on the other side ,",

    "this is an @xmath114 problem for the binomial - tree method , @xmath115 being the number of time steps . allowing the time window for the averaging to slide would increase the storage and cpu time requirements by one power of @xmath115 .",
    "in contrast , the monte carlo approach is not impacted severely by such a generalization .",
    "a comparison with the corresponding errors of the simulation results for european options under the same conditions ( not shown ) reveals again that the errors are dominated by the finite size of the path sample and not by the uncertainty in determining the yes - no boundary . the effect of upward and downward bias in the estimations due to choosing either the original or the independently generated path sample are very weak as can be seen from the lower left panel of fig .  [ fig_4 ] .",
    "as explained before this is a direct result of the approximations in the optimization procedure * ( 3b ) * .",
    "it is noteworthy that the bias from parametrizing the yes - no boundary on a grid ( in @xmath2 direction ) is stronger than either bias from taking one of the two path samples .",
    "the representation of the yes - no boundary on a grid tends to _ underestimate _ the option prices because of the coarse graining procedure involved .",
    "the small nonstatistical downward net bias can be read off from the average deviation between monte carlo estimation and binomial tree results for the options contingent on geometric averages .",
    "it amounts to -  0.24 % for the results based on the original path sample and -  0.1 % for the independent path sample .",
    "results for prices of options contingent on arithmetic averages over the whole lifetime of the option are also included in fig .  [ fig_4 ] ( lower right panel ) . since no other accurate method is available , we present the distribution of relative deviations between the values based on an approximate formula suggested by ritchken , sankarasubramanian , and vijh ( 1989 ) and the simulation results .",
    "the approximate formula relates the price for a claim contingent on the arithmetic average to the corresponding option price using geometric averaging via @xmath116 here @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) denotes `` value of american ( european ) option '' .",
    "the subscript @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) refers to arithmetic ( geometric ) averaging .",
    "the superscripts @xmath121 and @xmath122 characterize the method of calculation , binomial tree and monte carlo respectively .",
    "[ fig_4 ] shows that the approximation works reasonably well .",
    "we have shown in this paper how to construct monte carlo algorithms for american option valuation .",
    "we are in the lucky situation that the suggested algorithm turns out to be conceptually simpler than the other algorithms suggested so far .",
    "it depends only linearly on the number of sampled paths and exercise dates which makes it computationally feasable to get close to the continuum limit for these two variables .",
    "thus no price is to be paid for the accuracy of this novel monte carlo algorithm in terms of more cpu time or exceedingly large storage requirements .",
    "the crucial element , the optimization of a certain payoff function of the path sample , turns out to be numerically rather stable .",
    "the tracking of the yes - no boundary is achieved most precisely in those regions of the state space covered densely by sampled paths , i.e.  where it is needed for the option price estimation .",
    "there is a further reason for the algorithm s stability . in case",
    "a maximum turns out to be shallow and is therefore not easily found by the algorithm , the option price does not depend much on the exact location of the boundary between early - exercise and hold region .",
    "indeed , we have demonstrated that the errors in the simulation results are typically dominated by the statistical errors if the size of the path sample is on the order of @xmath103 .",
    "this points to one important direction of future research .",
    "paskov and traub ( 1995 ) have shown that the replacement of pseudo - random numbers in the traditional monte carlo approach by a series of so - called quasi - random numbers may lead to a spectacular gain in the precision of the achievable results , at least for some problems .",
    "the reason is that the quasi - random numbers are distributed more evenly . by using appropriately chosen sequences of quasi - random numbers sample sizes for estimation of european options",
    "could be reduced by orders of magnitude , without loss of accuracy .",
    "it would open new dimensions for the applications of the novel monte carlo algorithm if this would also hold true for american options .",
    "moreover , we would like to add that the extraction of sensitivity coefficients  usually called the `` greeks ''  employing the novel monte carlo algorithm is as straightforward as for previously considered situations , e.g.  by fu and hu ( 1995 ) .",
    "we have presented some simulations for option types for which other means of calculation are known .",
    "however , the monte carlo algorithm presented here provides unique opportunities to evaluate path - dependent option prices for which no other methods are available or computationally feasible .",
    "one example , the case of options contingent on arithmetic averages has been discussed already in this paper .",
    "another candidate are `` look - back '' options of american style .",
    "usually , look - back options allow the owner to buy or sell an asset for a price dependent on the values of the asset during the whole lifetime until expiry , in the simplest case the minimum or maximum .",
    "restricting the time window for the look back but allowing for early exercise adds american features to these rather common options .",
    "another virtue of the presented monte carlo algorithm is to allow option valuation for more complicated stochastic processes than wiener - type diffusion .",

    "<S> the field has been pioneered by black and scholes ( 1973 ) . </S>",
    "<S> they made a major breakthrough by deriving a formula for the price of any contingent claim which depends on a non - dividend - paying stock . using the assumption of no arbitrage </S>",
    "<S> , they were able to show that the price of a derivative security can be expressed as the expected value of its discounted payoffs . </S>",
    "<S> the expectation is taken under the assumption of a _ risk - neutral _ evolution of the value of the underlying security . </S>",
    "<S> merton ( 1973 ) generalized these ideas to situations in which the interest rates themselves fluctuate in time . </S>",
    "<S> due to the complexity of the underlying dynamics , numerical methods have become increasingly popular in modern finance . </S>",
    "<S> they are used for a variety of purposes , for instance valuation of securities and stress testing of portfolios . </S>",
    "<S> analytical solutions for problems in finance have been found only for rather special cases . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in order to gain the solution for prices of european options black and scholes had to assume that the evolution of the underlying asset price ( more precisely its natural logarithm ) follows a so - called wiener process with time - independent volatility . </S>",
    "<S> european options can be exercised only at expiration date . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , american - style options which can be exercised during the whole lifetime of the option can be valued only numerically . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , numerical methods have to be employed if the dimension of the problem increases ( more than one state variable ) or in case of more realistic approaches to the stochastic process like for some no - arbitrage models of interest rate evolution .    </S>",
    "<S> the monte carlo approach lends itself very naturally to the evaluation of security prices and interest rates . </S>",
    "<S> schematically , it consists of the following steps . first , sample paths of the state variables ( asset prices and so on ) over the relevant time horizon are generated . </S>",
    "<S> the cash flows of the securities on each sample path are evaluated , as determined by the structure of the security in question . </S>",
    "<S> the discounted cash flows are averaged over the sample paths . </S>",
    "<S> the monte carlo method is very flexible , since it does not depend much on the specific nature of the underlying stochastic process . </S>",
    "<S> its accuracy is also independent on the dimensionality of the problem which is its dominant advantage over more traditional numerical integration methods . </S>",
    "<S> it is outside the scope of this paper to discuss the various facets of recent research on the use of monte carlo in the finance area . </S>",
    "<S> the reader may consult the concise recent reviews of boyle , broadie , and glassermann ( 1997 ) on these topics . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , they report on recent progress in developing more _ efficient _ monte carlo algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> standard monte carlo methods converge notoriously slow ( with 1/@xmath0 , @xmath1 being the number of sampled paths ) . </S>",
    "<S> a central goal of recent research activity has therefore been the refinement of variance reduction techniques ( antithetic and control variates ) , importance sampling and low - discrepancy random number sequences . </S>",
    "<S> if the development in sciences like physics is any guide , monte carlo applications in finance will become even more important . with computational prowess further increasing the monte carlo method may even shed its ` brute force ' image from the past which was founded on its rather slow convergence property .    </S>",
    "<S> boyle ( 1977 ) was the first to propose the use of monte carlo methods for option pricing in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> since the exercise date of european contingent claims is fixed , the mechanics of a price evaluation of european options employing the monte carlo method is rather straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> let us begin by collecting the notation for the most important variables which we are going to use throughout the rest of the paper . </S>",
    "<S> in general , we follow the notation in hull s book ( 1993 ) , except that the present time for which the option price is calculated is designated to be `` 0 '' ( without loss of generality ) .    </S>",

    "<S> we may easily estimate the european option value from a monte carlo path sample for the variables related to the derivative security . </S>",
    "<S> these paths need to be generated with probabilities determined by the underlying stochastic process . </S>",
    "<S> the option value at the expiration date @xmath11 has been specified in the option contract . </S>",
    "<S> in general , it may depend on the path of the relevant state variables between closing the contract and expiration date . </S>",
    "<S> each pathwise final option value from the simulation is discounted backward in time to determine its value at time 0 . </S>",
    "<S> since we do not know at time @xmath3=0 yet on which path the underlying variables will evolve , the average over all paths is taken to estimate the present option value : @xmath12 the discount factor includes the risk - free interest rate @xmath13 , possibly averaged over the lifetime @xmath11 of the option . </S>",
    "<S> for simplicity , it is assumed in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_europt_mc ] ) that all sampled paths have equal probability . </S>",
    "<S> generalization to a situation in which paths are characterized by different probabilities which may arise e.g.  in the context of monte carlo optimization by importance sampling is straightforward .    the pricing of options which may be exercised prior to the expiration date by monte carlo simulation is more involved . </S>",
    "<S> here , the owner holds the right to exercise the option at several ( bermudan ) or possibly infinitely many ( american ) ` decision dates ' . </S>",
    "<S> many types of american contingent claims trade on exchanges and in the over - the - counter market . </S>",
    "<S> examples include options , swaptions , binary options and asian options . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown by roll ( 1977 ) , geske ( 1979 ) , and whaley ( 1981 ) that exercise of _ call _ options which give the owner the right to purchase some underlying asset at the agreed - on strike price is usually unfavorable before expiration date , except close to ex - dividend dates . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is much less clear - cut in case of _ put _ options which give the owner the right to sell the asset at the strike price . in these situations </S>",
    "<S> the ` naive ' monte carlo is encountering unsurmountable difficulties . in order to decide whether it is more favorable at some intermediate time to hold or exercise the option the owner needs to compare the expected payoff in the two cases . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum of the two forms the option value at that time which  after discounting and taking the expectation value  leads to the following expression for the option at closing date : @xmath14 the angular brackets denote the expectation value with respect to the ( risk - free ) probability measure . the path - dependent times @xmath15 are the so - called optimum stopping times which may be any of the decision dates .    </S>",
    "<S> a single path provides clearly insufficient information to evaluate the option value in case of non - exercise at any of the decision dates . </S>",
    "<S> the insufficiency of the naive monte carlo method to deal with the optimum stopping problem has lead some authors like hull ( 1993 ) to the claim in the literature that  monte carlo simulation can only be used for european - style options \" . on the other side , evaluation of american - style options via </S>",
    "<S> monte carlo simulation has found already some consideration in the literature as reviewed boyle , broadie , and glassermann ( 1997 ) . </S>",
    "<S> their common denominator is a ` clever ' estimate of the option prices on the decision dates by bundling subsets of paths . </S>",
    "<S> these authors noted that the suggested algorithms can not be considered satisfactory yet . </S>",
    "<S> either some approximations may lead to uncontroled errors affecting the simulation results or the required large computational effort limits their applicability , e.g.  to a small number of exercise dates .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we are suggesting a completely different strategy to calculate american - style put and call option prices via monte carlo simulation . </S>",
    "<S> during the sampling of the paths we do _ not _ attempt to estimate the expectation of the payoff if the owner continues to hold the option . instead , we use the sampled paths to evaluate the boundary between the early - exercise region and the hold region in the space of variables entering into the option contract . </S>",
    "<S> the location of this boundary is the crucial piece of information whose knowledge allows the straightforward use of the monte carlo procedure for option price estimation . </S>",
    "<S> we treat the valuation of american options as an _ optimization problem _ of a certain payoff function which depends on the set of sampled paths . </S>",
    "<S> this function depends also on the exercise policy , i.e.  the boundary between the early - exercise region and the complementary hold region ( yes - no boundary in the following ) . </S>",
    "<S> maximation of the payoff function provides an estimator of the yes - no boundary which gets arbitrarily close to the true location of the boundary with increasing number of sampled paths . </S>",
    "<S> for the plain vanilla put and call options , the boundary is rather simple at any exercise date , a point for one state variable , a line for a two - dimensional space of state variables and so on . </S>",
    "<S> after the boundary has been estimated the price estimation proceeds as for european options , because the option prices for points on the boundary are known . the only difference to price estimation of european options as in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_europt_mc ] ) is that  concerning paths crossing the yes - no boundary  each pathwise option value is discounted starting from the point at which the path crosses the boundary for the first time : @xmath16 time @xmath17 denotes the earliest time at which the @xmath18-th path crosses the yes - no boundary ( if at all ) . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise @xmath17 equals the time until expiration of the option ( @xmath11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 is the agreed - on payoff from exercising the option at time @xmath17 under the assumption that path @xmath18 represents the realized evolution of the underlying state variables . here </S>",

    "<S> of course , the algorithm is able to handle the other possibility  immediate exercise  as well . in this case calculation of </S>",
    "<S> the option price is trivial , however .    in a later section of this paper </S>",
    "<S> we will demonstrate that the novel monte carlo algorithm achieves an accuracy in the determination of american option values which compares well with corresponding calculations for european options . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the results for a spectrum of standard american puts with results from binomial tree calculations . </S>",
    "<S> this method originally introduced by cox , ross , rubinstein ( 1979 ) is widely used for option valuation . here </S>",
    "<S> we assume an ideal wiener - type stochastic process for a single state variable , because a binomial tree is well suited to provide very accurate results in this situation . </S>",
    "<S> of course , this comparison serves mostly illustrative purposes to show that the method works at finite @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> lateron , we are going to present numerical results for _ path - dependent _ american options . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two cases , puts on either the geometric or the arithmetic average over the lifetime of the option . </S>",
    "<S> assuming again an underlying ideal wiener process we may compare the monte carlo estimations to results from binomial tree calculations . while options on the geometric average can be priced by the tree method to arbitrary accuracy </S>",
    "<S> no such tree method is available for options contingent on the arithmetic average value . </S>",
    "<S> some approximative method has been suggested to express the latter option prices by the corresponding prices in case of geometric averaging . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we will compare the approximative formula to our more accurate procedure . </S>",
    "<S> in general , it is envisioned that the novel monte carlo approach and some variants will be applied for valuation problems which can not or not easily be tackled by other methods . </S>",
    "<S> such problems encompass stochastic processes with non - markov properties , stochastic volatilities , multi - dimensional state variables and other path - dependent american options . </S>"
