    "in 2002 , the selex collaboration reported the first observation of a candidate for a double charmed baryon , decaying as @xmath6@xcite .",
    "the state had a mass of 3519 @xmath4 2 , and its observed width was consistent with experimental resolution , less than 5 @xmath7 .",
    "the final state contained a charmed hadron , a baryon , and negative strangeness ( and @xmath8 ) , consistent with the cabibbo - allowed decay of a configuration . in order to confirm the interpretation of this state as a double charm baryon ,",
    "it is essential to observe the same state in some other way .",
    "other experiments with large charm baryon samples , e.g. , the focus and e-791 fixed target charm experiments at fermilab or the b - factories , have not confirmed the double charm signal .",
    "this is consistent with the selex results .",
    "the report in ref .",
    "@xcite emphasized that this new state was produced by the baryon beams ( @xmath9 , proton ) in selex , but not by the @xmath10 beam .",
    "it also noted that the apparent lifetime of the state was significantly shorter than that of the @xmath11 , which was not expected in a model calculation based on heavy quark effective theory  @xcite .    another way to confirm the",
    "is to observe it in a different decay mode that also involves a final state with baryon number and charm ( not anti - charm ) .",
    "one such mode , involving only stable charged particles , is the channel . observing a mass peak near the  peak at 3519 reported in ref .",
    "@xcite in a channel combining a proton with a @xmath12 pair but not a @xmath13 pair would confirm the existence of the state .",
    "here we report the first observation of .",
    "the selex experiment used the fermilab charged hyperon beam at 600 gev to produce charm particles in a set of thin foil targets of cu or diamond .",
    "the negative beam composition was about 50% @xmath9 , 50% @xmath10 .",
    "the positive beam was 90% protons .",
    "a beam transition radiation detector identified each beam particle as meson or baryon with zero overlap .",
    "the three - stage magnetic spectrometer is shown elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the most important features are the high - precision , highly redundant , vertex detector that provided an average proper time resolution of 20   for the charm decays , a 10 m long ring - imaging cerenkov ( rich ) detector that separated @xmath14 from k up to 165 gev / c  @xcite , and a high - resolution tracking system that had momentum resolution of @xmath15 for a proton .",
    "the experiment selected charm candidate events using an online secondary vertex algorithm .",
    "a scintillator trigger demanded an inelastic collision with at least four charged tracks in the interaction scintillators and at least two hits in the positive particle hodoscope after the second analyzing magnet .",
    "event selection in the online filter required full track reconstruction for measured fast tracks ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "these tracks were extrapolated back into the vertex silicon planes and linked to silicon hits .",
    "the beam track was measured in upstream silicon detectors .",
    "a three - dimensional vertex fit was then performed .",
    "an event was written to tape if all the fast tracks in the event were _ inconsistent _ with having come from a single primary vertex .",
    "this filter passed 1/8 of all interaction triggers and had about @xmath17 efficiency for otherwise accepted charm decays .",
    "the experiment recorded data from @xmath18 inelastic interactions and wrote @xmath19 events to tape using both positive and negative beams .",
    "the sample was @xmath20 @xmath21-induced , with the balance split roughly equally between @xmath22 and protons .",
    "the offline analysis selected single charm events with a topological identification procedure . only charged tracks with reconstructed momenta were used .",
    "tracks which traversed the rich ( @xmath23 ) were identified as protons or kaons if those hypotheses were more likely than the pion hypothesis .",
    "all other tracks were assumed to be pions .",
    "the primary vertex was refit offline using all found tracks .",
    "an event was rejected if all tracks were consistent with one primary vertex .",
    "for those events which were inconsistent with a single primary vertex , secondary vertices were formed geometrically and then tested against a set of charge , rich identification , and mass conditions to identify candidates for the different single charm states .",
    "candidate events were written to a charm data summary file .",
    "subsequent analysis began by selecting particular single - charm species from that set of events .",
    "in this study we began with the selex @xmath24 sample that has been used in lifetime and hadroproduction studies  @xcite .",
    "the sample - defining cuts are described in that reference .",
    "no new cuts on the d mesons were introduced in this analysis .",
    "the d meson momentum vector had to point back to the primary vertex with @xmath25 ( the double charm lifetime is known to be much shorter than the d meson lifetime , so the d meson pointback is not affected by having come from a secondary decay ) .",
    "the d meson decay point must have a vertex separation significance of at least 10 @xmath26 from the primary . everywhere in these analyses",
    "the vertex error used is the quadrature sum of the errors on the primary and secondary vertices .",
    "the k was positively identified by the rich detector .",
    "the pions were required to be rich - identified if they went into its acceptance .",
    "the and mass distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ dmass ] .",
    "there are 1450  decays and 2450  decays in these samples .",
    "the events contribute to the signal channel .",
    "the events can not come from the decay of a double charm baryon and will be used as a topological background control sample .",
    "the yield asymmetry stems from the d - quark contribution of the @xmath9 beam component that gives a sizeable production asymmetry favoring leading @xmath27 production over @xmath28 production , as we have reported for other charm systems  @xcite .",
    "the track - based search code is identical to that used on the @xmath29 sample in the original investigation  @xcite .",
    "the premise is that a ccd state will make a secondary decay vertex between the primary production vertex in one of the thin foil targets and the observed d meson decay vertex , which must lie outside material .",
    "we looked for intermediate vertices using all charge zero pairs of tracks from the set of reconstructed tracks not assigned to the d - meson candidate .",
    "the additional positive track in this final state must be rich - identified as a proton if it traverses the rich .",
    "the negative track in the new vertex is assigned the kaon mass .",
    "( this track typically missed the rich acceptance by being too soft or too wide - angle , as confirmed by simulation . )",
    "we made background studies by ( i ) assigning the negative track a pion mass , ( ii ) looking for proton plus positive track combinations with a d meson , and ( iii ) looking at proton @xmath30 combinations ( wrong - sign charm ) .",
    "we require a good 3-prong vertex fit with a separation significance of at least 1.0 @xmath26 from the primary vertex , the same requirement used in ref .",
    "the primary position was recalculated from the beam track and secondary tracks assigned to neither the d nor the p@xmath8 vertices .",
    "results presented in this paper come from this analysis .",
    "the signal search was based on a 10 window centered on the mass 3519   from ref .",
    "the expected mass resolution for the decay  is 4 .",
    "our simulation correctly reproduces the observed widths of all our reported single charm mesons and baryons .",
    "the 10   window should collect 80% of the events in a signal .",
    "the results are insensitive to changing bin boundaries by up to half a bin .",
    "the background , assumed to be flat , is evaluated outside a 20  window , to avoid putting the remaining 20% of any signal into the background .",
    "the right - sign mass combinations in fig .",
    "[ dpkmass](a ) show an excess of 5.4 events over a background of 1.6 events . the wrong - sign mass combinations ( @xmath31 quark in the decay ) for the @xmath32 final state",
    "are also plotted in fig .",
    "[ dpkmass ] ( b ) , scaled by 0.6 for the @xmath33ratio .",
    "the wrong - sign background shows no evidence for a significant narrow structure near 3519 .",
    "the average wrong - sign occupancy is 0.4 events / bin , exactly the background seen in the right - sign channel .",
    "this confirms the combinatoric character of the background population in the right - sign signal .",
    "we have investigated all possible permutations of particle assignments .",
    "the only significant structure observed is in the channel , the place where a double charm baryon decay can occur .    in order to assign a significance level to this peak",
    ", we have combined statistical methods used in the original double charm paper  @xcite and the event - mixing method used in ref .",
    "we set out to test the hypothesis that the background events in fig .",
    "[ dpkmass ] are random combinatoric tracks associated with real @xmath34 mesons . to mix events we took a @xmath34 meson in the peak region ( fig .",
    "[ dmass ] ) and combined it with proton and @xmath35 tracks extracted from other events .",
    "each @xmath34 was reused 25 times .",
    "to compare to the combinatoric background in fig .",
    "[ dpkmass ] , we scale the mixed - event background down for the multiple @xmath34 usage .    the resulting background distribution predicts the observed distribution very well .",
    "the mean number of background events below , in , and above the 4-bin signal peak is 5.74 @xmath4 0.26 , 1.38 @xmath4 0.13 , and 10.60 @xmath4 0.36 . this agrees well with the 8 , 1.6 , and 10 events that we observe in the corresponding regions . a mass plot with the combinatoric background level is shown in fig .",
    "[ combo ] .",
    "the background that we observe is completely consistent in shape and normalization with random combinatoric tracks associated with real @xmath34 mesons .",
    "we take the combinatoric background to give a proper measure of the expected background under the 7-event signal region .",
    "the single - bin significance of the signal , using the above background numbers , is : s = ( 7 - 1.38)/@xmath36 = 4.8 @xmath26 . the poisson probability of observing at least this much excess , including the gaussian uncertainty in the background , is 6.4 x @xmath37 .",
    "both of these statistical significance calculations use methods identical to those in ref  @xcite .",
    "this indicates a robust signal atop a combinatoric background whose shape and normalization are very well understood .",
    "in order to estimate the mass of the   state in light of the sparse statistics in fig .",
    "[ dpkmass ] , we fixed the width of the gaussian to 4 and fitted the data distribution around the signal peak .",
    "the fit mass is @xmath4 .",
    "this agrees beautifully with the measurement of 3519 @xmath4 2 from the original double charm baryon report .",
    "we present these data as confirmation of the double charm state at 3520 @xmath7 in a new decay mode .",
    "the weighted average mass is @xmath38 .",
    "the mass distributions for the two channels are shown in fig .",
    "[ dpkmass_both ] .",
    "we have used the simulation to study the relative acceptance for the two decay channels  and  in order to quote a relative branching ratio .",
    "the overall acceptance , including the single charm selection and the proton i d requirements in the  mode , is very similar .",
    "selex measures the relative branching ratio @xmath39()/@xmath39 ( ) @xmath40 .",
    "the systematic error due to acceptances is well understood from single charm studies and is negligible compared to the statistical error .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we noted that all observed ccd events were produced by the baryon beams .",
    "none came from pions . in this sample , 1 event out of the 7 in the peak region seen in fig .",
    "[ dpkmass ] is a pion beam event , and 1 of the 19 sideband events comes from the pion beam sample .",
    "this sample is consistent with the view that double charm baryons are produced dominantly by the baryon beams in selex . in another comparison",
    ", we had noted that the  decays had an exceptionally short reduced proper time distribution , indicating a decay lifetime 5 - 10 times shorter than the lifetime .",
    "that feature is confirmed by the  channel . as we noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , our lifetime resolution is excellent but we can not exclude 0 lifetime ( strong decay ) for these events .",
    "the width of this peak is completely consistent with simulation of a zero - width state , unlikely for a strong decay of a massive state .",
    "also , we do not see an increase in the signal when we reduce the vertex significance cut l/@xmath26 below 1 .",
    "if this were a strong decay , one would expect as many events with l/@xmath26 of -1 as + 1 , so the signal should grow significantly .",
    "it does not .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we noted that the  yield and acceptance implied that a large fraction of the decays seen in selex came from double charm decays .",
    "that was a surprise .",
    "for the  case that is not true .",
    "only a few percent of the selex @xmath28 events are associated with double charm .",
    "in summary , selex reports an independent confirmation of the double charm baryon previously seen in the  decay mode via the observation of its decay into the  final state .",
    "using only very loose cuts gives the statistically - significant signal shown in fig .",
    "[ dpkmass ] .",
    "a combinatoric background from event mixing describes the non - signal distribution well .",
    "the gaussian signficance using this background estimate is @xmath2 .",
    "this decay mode confirms that the lifetime is very short and that it is produced dominantly by baryon beams , as we reported in ref .",
