    "the primary scientific goal of the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) aboard the _ cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) _ spacecraft is the measurement of the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) at wavelengths from 1.25 to 240 @xmath0 .",
    "this radiation is the cumulative emission of pregalactic sources , protogalaxies , and evolving galaxies , as well as emission from more exotic processes not common in the local universe ( e.g. bond , carr , & hogan 1986 ) .",
    "these sources of the cib may be found anywhere from the earliest epoch after radiation and matter were decoupled to the present day .",
    "the contribution to the cib from galaxies will be composed of stellar emission from distant galaxies that is redshifted by the cosmological expansion from intrinsically shorter wavelengths , as well as the direct ir emission from stars and dust within galaxies at all distances .",
    "the constraints that dirbe places on the cib are discussed by hauser et al .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter paper i ) and dwek et al .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter paper iv ) .",
    "however , in order to detect the cib , we first need to remove the strong contributions of foreground emission arising within our own solar system and galaxy .",
    "the ir foreground from within our solar system originates from the interplanetary dust ( ipd ) cloud . the modeling and removal of the scattering and emission from the ipd for the entire cold - mission dirbe data set",
    "are reported by kelsall et al .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter paper ii ) . following the removal of this foreground , we attack the next layer of foreground emission by modeling and subtracting the galactic ir emission .    the near - ir ( 1.25  4.9 @xmath0 ) emission of the galaxy is dominated by starlight . some bright stars and other compact sources",
    "are resolved as point sources in the dirbe data .",
    "most stars blend into a diffuse background , showing a disk and bulge very similar in appearance to many edge - on spiral galaxies .",

    "this paper details the development of models of the galactic ir emission .",
    "the primary intended use for the models is to permit an accurate measurement of an extragalactic ir background .",
    "the characterization of the sources that give rise to the galactic emission is an important secondary result of the process .",
    "an overview of the procedures used for modeling the galactic foreground is given in section 2 .",
    "section 3 describes the dirbe data set and its preparation , particularly the removal of the ipd scattering and emission ( paper ii ) .",
    "section 4 describes the modeling and removal of starlight from the 1.25 to 25 @xmath0 measurements .",
    "the following section (  5 ) describes in detail the modeling and removal of the ism emission from dirbe data .",
    "additional investigation into the far - ir emissivity of the diffuse ionized ism is contained in the appendix .",
    "the accuracy of the removal of the galactic emission is a major limitation to the detection of the cib , and consequently section 6 discusses estimates of the uncertainties of the data and procedures .",
    "a brief discussion of the implications of this modeling for galactic properties is contained in section 7 .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the galactic ism as revealed by this work has been reported by dwek et al .",
    "finally , a brief summary of results is given in section 8 .",
    "companion papers ( papers i & iv ) contain analyses of the residual emission , and its implications for the detection of the cib .",
    "we will assume that at any time , @xmath1 , the total intensity observed at a given wavelength and a specified galactic longitude and latitude , @xmath2 , can be represented by : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the contribution from the interplanetary dust cloud , @xmath5 is the contribution from stars ( resolved and unresolved ) and other compact sources within the galaxy , @xmath6 is the contribution from the interstellar medium , and @xmath7 is residual intensity obtained by subtracting the former three components from the total observed intensity .",
    "the procedures we apply are designed to ensure that the cib is fully contained within this residual emission , i.e. , that no cib component is inadvertently included in the models of the ipd cloud or galactic emission components .",
    "the contribution of the ipd to the infrared sky , @xmath4 , has been calculated in paper ii .",
    "the ipd cloud is modeled using a geometric kernel similar to that developed to represent ipd emission in the _ iras _ data ( wheelock et al .",
    "the model ensures the preservation of the cib intensity by fitting the time variation of the ipd emission rather than the intensity directly .",
    "the model does not contain any explicit isotropic component which would produce no time variation .",
    "details of this model are presented in paper ii .    in the dirbe data ,",
    "the stellar emission component of the galaxy , @xmath5 , consists of two components : the first is a discrete component , which includes all bright sources that exceed the local background level by a chosen amount , depending on wavelength ; and the second is a smooth component , consisting of unresolved stellar sources which can be represented by using a statistical model for calculating the brightness of the galaxy .    rather than modeling and removing each of the bright sources at all wavelengths ,",
    "the locations of these sources are simply blanked and excluded from any further processing or analysis .",
    "sources excluded by this procedure consist of bright stars at short wavelengths , and diffuse sources such as the magellanic clouds and bright star - forming regions in the galactic plane ( e.g. the @xmath8 oph and orion regions ) , which appear at all wavelengths .",
    "the procedure for constructing the bright source removed maps is described in detail in section 4.1 .",
    "the unresolved stellar emission component is represented by a `` faint source model , '' which closely follows the `` sky '' model described by wainscoat et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , and further developed by cohen ( 1993a , 1994a , 1995 ) .",
    "the sky model of galactic structure was originally developed to fit ground - based @xmath9-band and @xmath10-band and _ iras _ 12 and 25 @xmath0 galactic source counts .",
    "the fitting of source counts of known types of objects , instead of total intensity measurements , ensures that the model intensity represents that of the galactic sources , thereby excluding any possible unresolved extragalactic contribution .    to guarantee that the modeled ism contribution to the sky brightness includes only galactic emission ,",
    "we will write this emission component , @xmath6 , as a product of a spatially invariant spectral component @xmath11 times a wavelength - independent spatial template .",
    "the spatial template , such as the galactic h i or co column density , is associated with the galactic gas phase component in which the dust resides .",
    "the advantage of such a procedure is that the line emission from most extragalactic sources is redshifted to velocities higher than those at which galactic line emission is observed .",
    "thus , the h i and co data can be used as templates of the local ( galactic ) ir emission of the ism , without any contributions from extragalactic sources . in principle",
    ", @xmath11 can be obtained directly as the slope of a linear least squares fit to the correlation of @xmath12 [ @xmath13 with the h i or co spatial template for all wavelengths @xmath14 .",
    "the intercept will then yield the value of @xmath7 .",
    "however , the main limitations to such a direct approach are : that there can be relatively large spatial variations in @xmath11 , the ir emission per h atom ; and that high - quality h i and co data sets have restricted sky coverage or different spatial resolution compared to the dirbe data . these limitations can be circumvented by using the 100 @xmath0 ism emission @xmath15 @xmath16 as the spatial template for ism emission at the other wavelengths .",
    "the subtraction of the interstellar component was therefore performed in the following manner .",
    "first , @xmath11 and @xmath17 @xmath16 were obtained as the slope and intercept of the correlation between @xmath18 @xmath16 and the h i spatial template .",
    "this step allows us to separate the ism emission , @xmath15 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath16 , from the potential cib , @xmath17 @xmath16 .",
    "then , we chose @xmath15 @xmath16 as the spatial template , and calculated @xmath11 by correlating this template with @xmath22 @xmath16 , so that @xmath23 @xmath16 .    for the near - ir wavelengths ( @xmath24 4.9 @xmath0 ) , the subtraction of the starlight is not sufficiently accurate to yield values of @xmath11 and @xmath7 from direct correlations of the near - ir data with @xmath15 @xmath16 .",
    "however , the dust emission in the near - ir can be more easily distinguished from the stellar emission in color - color plots ( e.g. , arendt et al .",
    "1994 ) , as points that are displaced from the reddening line for stellar emission .",
    "this aspect of the subtraction of the ism - related near - ir emission is described in detail in section 5.5 .",
    "the dirbe instrument provides absolutely calibrated intensity sky maps in 10 broad bands at 1.25 , 2.2 , 3.5 , and 4.9 @xmath0 ( near - ir ) , 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100 @xmath0 ( mid - ir ) , and 140 and 240 @xmath0 ( far - ir ) . the instrumental zero point is established by chopping between the sky and a cold zero - flux reference source at 32 hz .",
    "frequent observations of internal reference sources and stable celestial sources allow corrections for small instrumental gain instabilities on both short and long time scales .",
    "measurements of a few well - calibrated celestial sources ( sirius for 1.25  12 @xmath0 , ngc 7027 for 25 @xmath0 , uranus for 60 and 100 @xmath0 , and jupiter for 140 and 240 @xmath0 ) provide the absolute calibration of the dirbe photometric system .",
    "further details on the calibration of the data can be found in the _ cobe _ dirbe explanatory supplement ( 1997 ) .",
    "the dirbe time - ordered data are pixelized and mapped in the _ cobe _ sky - cube format ( _ cobe _ dirbe explanatory supplement 1997 ) .",
    "all analysis is performed on maps in this coordinate system . for illustrational purposes , maps shown in this paper",
    "are reprojected into a galactic mollweide projection .",
    "the mollweide projection is an equal - area projection with the convenient properties that longitudes are equally spaced ( for a fixed latitude ) and all lines of constant latitude are straight horizontal lines ( though unequally spaced ) .",
    "the dirbe surface brightness maps are presented in units of mjy / sr , which can be converted to @xmath25 intensities in units of nw m@xmath26 sr@xmath27 through multiplication by 3000/@xmath14 , where @xmath14 is the wavelength of the band in @xmath0 .",
    "the sky was scanned by dirbe in a manner that provided highly redundant coverage over a @xmath28 wide swath in a single week .",
    "the viewing swath samples solar elongation angles from roughly @xmath29 to @xmath30 , and precesses with an annual period .",
    "the dirbe beam is @xmath31 at all wavelengths .",
    "a more complete description of the dirbe instrument has been given by silverberg et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and the _ cobe _ dirbe explanatory supplement ( 1997 ) .",
    "the _ cobe _",
    "mission is described by boggess et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .",
    "the highly redundant coverage per line of sight and wide range of solar elongation angles sampled provide an excellent database for purposes of modeling the ipd foreground in order to remove it from dirbe observations .",
    "we use the parametric geometrical model described by paper ii to compute the signal from the interplanetary dust cloud , denoted here as @xmath32 , for each line - of - sight ( pixel ) in the dirbe maps .",
    "components of the model are a smooth dust cloud , three pairs of dust bands , and a circumsolar ring in earth - orbit resonance .",
    "details on the construction of this model and on the accuracy of its results are presented in paper ii .",
    "maps of the intensity after subtraction of the ipd emission and scattered sunlight are shown in galactic mollweide projection in figure  [ zlsub_maps ] .",
    "these data available as the ` zodi - subtracted mission average ( zsma ) ' maps , through the nssdc _ cobe _ homepage website at @xmath33 .",
    "in order to model and remove the galactic foreground emission on the largest angular scales ,",
    "we excluded small localized regions that are much brighter ( and often had distinctly different properties ) than the average galactic foreground . these regions mainly consist of bright stars at the near - ir wavelengths , star forming regions at mid- and far - ir wavelengths , and a few nearby external galaxies [ see odenwald , newmark , & smoot ( 1997 ) for an analysis of the external galaxies visible to dirbe ] . the locations of these bright sources have been individually blanked from the maps , and were excluded from further analysis . even though the intensities in the unblanked pixels are left unchanged ,",
    "the mean intensity over large areas is reduced by the bright source blanking because the brightest pixels are now excluded .",
    "a number of bright source identification algorithms were tested , both for speed of execution and for source detection accuracy .",
    "we adopted an algorithm based upon pixel brightness relative to a locally determined smooth background .",
    "the smooth background level for each pixel in the map was computed using a morphological filter ( the `` opening '' operation ; see haralick , sternberg & zhuang 1987 ) , followed by a linear smoothing .",
    "pixels in the original map where the brightness exceeded the background level by more than a fixed threshold were blanked .",
    "these thresholds are : 15 , 15 , 15 , 15 , 85 , 110 jy for point sources at 1.25 , 2.2 , 3.5 , 4.9 , 12 , and 25 @xmath0 respectively and 4.5 mjy sr@xmath27 = 135 nw m@xmath26 sr@xmath27 for the more extended sources found at 100 @xmath0 .",
    "the 60 , 140 , and 240 @xmath0 maps were blanked at the same locations as the 100 @xmath0 map . because the dirbe beam is larger than a standard pixel ( @xmath34 ) ,",
    "the four nearest neighbor pixels were blanked as well .",
    "circular regions around the large and small magellanic clouds were blanked at all wavelengths .",
    "the fraction of the sky above @xmath35 that is excluded by the bright source removal ranges from @xmath3635% at the shortest wavelengths to @xmath371% at @xmath14 @xmath38 60 @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ bs_map ] shows the map of 2.2 @xmath0 intensity after the contribution of the ipd has been removed and the bright source blanking has been applied ( cf .",
    "[ zlsub_maps ] ) .",
    "all subsequent intensity maps will contain black regions indicating the locations where bright sources have been blanked .",
    "this source removal technique does not work well at low galactic latitudes , where both source confusion and the curvature of the background are high .",
    "in tests on simulated maps , however , the method was completely successful in blanking sources above @xmath39 .",
    "further tests showed that varying the threshold level by @xmath40 20% ( a generous estimate of the map noise ) changed the median brightness of the sky above @xmath41 by well under one percent at 1.25 and 2.2 @xmath0 , and even less at the other wavelengths .",
    "after the bright sources are removed by blanking , most of the residual diffuse near - ir emission is starlight from unresolved sources .",
    "these sources are sufficiently numerous and evenly distributed that a statistical model well represents their collective emission . to remove the galactic diffuse stellar emission component we constructed a `` faint source model '' ( fsm ) of the integrated brightnesses in the dirbe 1.25 , 2.2 , 3.5 , 4.9 , 12 and 25 @xmath0 bands , based on the statistical model developed by wainscoat et al .",
    "subsequent improvements to the wainscoat et al",
    ". `` sky '' model by cohen ( 1993a , 1994a , 1995 ) are generally not included in the fsm because they do not pertain to emission at near - ir wavelengths or because they are not specified in detail such that they can be accurately reproduced within the framework of the fsm .",
    "the fsm can be used to calculate the surface brightness in any direction of the sky by integrating the flux emitted by the various stellar components along that line of sight .",
    "if the galaxy consisted of a single type of star , with a corresponding absolute magnitude @xmath42 , then the sky brightness along a line of sight would be given by : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the number density of sources at a given position in the galaxy which is integrated along the line of sight @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the optical depth along the line of sight , and @xmath47 is the luminosity of a zero magnitude star .",
    "a more realistic representation of the sky brightness must include a summation over many different stellar types and their spatial distributions . the simple expression ( eq .",
    "[ eq_fsm ] ) is then replaced by the more complicated one : @xmath48 where the summations over @xmath49 and @xmath50 represent , respectively , those over stellar types , and over galactic structural components , and the integral over @xmath42 represents the fact that stars of a given type have an intrinsic dispersion @xmath51 in absolute magnitudes centered on @xmath52 with a probability @xmath53 .",
    "the fsm follows the basic form of the wainscoat et al . and sky models , including 5 structural components for the galaxy ( disk , spiral arms , molecular ring , bulge , and halo ) , 87 source types , each with a dispersion of absolute magnitudes , and interstellar extinction from dust in an exponential ( in radius and scale height , @xmath54 ) disk .",
    "the spiral arm component includes the local spur as defined by cohen ( 1994a ) .",
    "we have made several modifications to our fsm , deviating from the sky model , either out of necessity or to produce results more suited for comparison with the dirbe data :    \\a ) since source count models can not accurately represent the brightest point sources , which are unevenly distributed across the sky , the fsm was only integrated over stars fainter than those that were previously blanked from the dirbe maps .",
    "the value of the brightness limit at which the bright source blanking stops and the faint source model begins is not a significant source of uncertainty .",
    "changes in the limits by 20% produce @xmath375% changes in the faint source model intensities , which are largely offset by complementary changes in the flux excluded by the bright source blanking ( section 4.1 . ) .",
    "\\b ) we have increased the spatial resolution of the model and calculated the sky brightness at the resolution of the dirbe maps .",
    "\\c ) the halo is described by wainscoat et al .",
    "( 1992 ) only as an @xmath55 law in projected surface brightness .",
    "therefore we have adapted the formulation for the volume density presented by young ( 1976 ) for use in our faint source model . at high galactic latitudes ,",
    "the halo is the third most important component of the faint source model after the disk and the spiral arms .",
    "\\d ) we omitted the extragalactic component of the sky model , which contributes mainly at faint magnitudes at 25 @xmath0 ( cohen 1994a ) .",
    "\\e ) the position of the sun was set at 18 pc above the midplane of the galactic disk .",
    "this was determined during preliminary trials , by requiring equal brightnesses at the north and south galactic poles after subtraction of the fsm in the near ir bands .",
    "this value is independently supported by analysis done with the sky model ( cohen 1995 ) .",
    "\\f ) for 3.5 and 4.9 @xmath0 absolute magnitudes , which are not represented in the wainscoat et al . ( 1992 ) source table , we obtained approximate magnitudes for the various source types by extrapolating from the @xmath56 magnitudes using @xmath57 and @xmath58 stellar colors from johnson ( 1966 ) .",
    "\\g ) the conversion from magnitudes to fluxes was done in a manner consistent with the absolute calibration of the dirbe data ( see _ cobe _ dirbe explanatory supplement , 1997 ) .",
    "the intensities of the fsm at 2.2 @xmath0 were multiplied by a factor of 0.963 to account for differences between the color corrections of sirius ( which was used as the dirbe absolute calibrator ) and those of k and m giants which dominate the emission of the fsm and have a co absorption band partially within the 2.2 @xmath0 dirbe passband . there",
    "exist uncertainties of 10  15% in the model arising from details of the absolute calibration of the model and the differences and treatment of the various broadband filter responses ( cohen 1993b ) .    to check our fsm , we compared the results of our calculations to the average surface brightnesses of 238 large zones covering the entire sky as calculated by the sky model ( cohen 1994b",
    "; see table 7 of wainscoat et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for the zone boundaries ) .",
    "our faint source model reproduces the mean intensities calculated with the sky model to within @xmath365% for most of the zones .",
    "the zones that are not well matched are all low - latitude zones below @xmath39 ( except for the zone containing the lmc and another near the taurus region ) which have been adjusted in the sky model , but not in the fsm , for various localized features within the galaxy ( cohen 1994a ) .",
    "we have also compared the star counts expected from our fsm with the star counts from the prototype 2mass survey in 7 fields at @xmath56 and @xmath59 ( skrutskie 1996 ) .",
    "the fields are all in the first galactic quadrant and span the range @xmath60 .",
    "the fsm star counts resemble the 2mass star counts , although about half the fields show statistically significant differences , mostly at magnitudes @xmath61 and @xmath62 . however , these fainter stars contribute a small enough fraction of total emission from these fields that the integrated brightnesses of the stars in the 2mass fields are consistent with the predictions of the faint source model .",
    "this comparison is limited by the small size of the fields ( 0.12  7 deg@xmath63 ) and thus the large statistical uncertainties on the star counts .",
    "figure  [ fsm_map ] shows the 2.2 @xmath0 sky brightness calculated with the fsm .",
    "the model predicts the mean intensity in each pixel , and thus varies smoothly over the sky .",
    "the actual sky is not expected to be as smooth as the model because random poisson deviations from the mean number of stars / magnitude in each pixel create intensity fluctuations .",
    "faint discontinuities in the model are caused by the artificially sharp edges of the spiral arms , as defined in the model ( wainscoat et al .",
    "1992 ; cohen 1994a ) .",
    "maps of the fsm intensities at 1.25  25 @xmath0 can be obtained from the nssdc _ cobe _ homepage website at @xmath33 .",
    "figure  [ gfs_map ] shows the 1.25  4.9 @xmath0 residual emission ( @xmath64 ) after the removal of stars and other compact objects with the bright source blanking and subtraction of the fsm . at these wavelengths ,",
    "the subtraction of the stellar emission is very effective at removing the brightness gradients at high galactic latitudes .",
    "the maps are mottled by the emission of the remaining faint , marginally resolved stars , which lie below the bright source threshold .",
    "the average emission of these remaining stars is included in the smooth faint source model .",
    "therefore , over sufficiently large regions this stellar confusion acts as an additional noise term in the residual maps . at wavelengths @xmath65 3.5 @xmath0 and low galactic latitudes ( @xmath66 )",
    ", the fsm tends to overestimate the actual sky brightness , leading to negative residuals .",
    "a longitudinally anti - symmetric residual is present at the location of the galactic bulge ( most clearly seen in the 4.9 @xmath0 map of fig .",
    "[ gfs_map ] ) , which suggests that improvements could result if a bar - like model were used for the bulge ( e.g. , dwek et al .",
    "1995 ; blitz & spergel 1991 ) .",
    "some relatively large differences between the model and the data are found at locations where our implementation of the faint source model has omitted particular adjustments for specific disk and spiral arm features ( cohen 1994a ) .",
    "residual defects from the subtraction of the ipd emission are seen clearly at wavelengths @xmath38 3.5 @xmath0 as s - shaped bands along the ecliptic .    in the mid - ir ( after removal of ipd emission )",
    ", the faint source emission contributes @xmath3740% of the observed brightness toward the inner galaxy at low latitudes , and less than 5% and 1% for @xmath67 at 12 and 25 @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the subtraction of the faint source model in these bands is only apparent in the inner galaxy , and residual intensity maps look nearly the same as those in figure  [ zlsub_maps ] . the residual emission at wavelengths @xmath38 12 @xmath0 is clearly dominated by the presence of ism emission , @xmath6 .",
    "the fsm was not optimized to fit the dirbe data , but is calculated from a fixed prescription based on a model designed to fit observed source counts in selected directions in the sky .",
    "it is therefore important to examine to what extent the removal of galactic starlight with the fsm has under- or over - subtracted stellar emission from the maps .",
    "one test designed to look for such effects is to search for structure in the residual map that may be correlated with that of the fsm , or galactic latitude .",
    "figures  [ gfs_b_grad ] and  [ gfs_beta_grad ] illustrate the gradients of @xmath12 as a function of galactic and ecliptic latitude , respectively , for the 1.25 , 2.2 , 3.5 , and 4.9 @xmath0 data .",
    "table  [ tab_fsm_grad ] lists the gradient and correlation coefficient for @xmath12 as a function of @xmath68 .",
    "the figures and table both show that the faint source model removes much of the galactic gradient in the near - ir emission .",
    "subtraction of the model also reduces the longitudinal variation of the near - ir sky brightness , as evidenced by the reduced dispersions at lower latitudes in figures  [ gfs_b_grad ] and  [ gfs_beta_grad ] . at 4.9 @xmath0 , the residual ipd gradient visible in figure [ gfs_beta_grad ] is responsible for the structure in the residual emission as a function of @xmath68 that is not observed at shorter wavelengths ( fig .",
    "[ gfs_b_grad ] ) .",
    "the last foreground component we need to remove is the emission from the galactic ism .",
    "as outlined in section 2 , we use the 100 @xmath0 dirbe data ( after removal of the ipd emission ) to derive a spatial template of the ism .",
    "we correlate the 100 @xmath0 data with tracers of the gas phase of the ism , and subtract emission that is uncorrelated with the ism to form the 100 @xmath0 ism template .",
    "the external data used to trace the gas phase of the ism are introduced in section 5.1 .",
    "then we derive the 100 @xmath0 emission per h i column density , and assess the possibilities that some of the emission comes from dust within the ionized and molecular phases of the ism (  5.2 ) . after subtracting the 100 @xmath0 emission that is not associated with the ism",
    ", we correlate the 100 @xmath0 ism template against the emission at other infrared wavelengths to derive the ism intensity at those wavelengths ( section 5.3 ) .",
    "the remaining subsections describe modified procedures that we apply to identify the ism emission at the longest ( 240 @xmath0 ) and shortest ( 3.5 and 4.9 @xmath0 ) wavelengths .",
    "the 100 @xmath0 map is chosen as the template of the high latitude ism because : ( a ) it provides full sky coverage ; ( b ) it has better sensitivity than the maps at longer wavelengths where noisier bolometric detectors were used ; ( c ) it is less affected by errors in the removal of ipd emission than the shorter wavelength maps ; and ( d ) it represents a compromise between potential differences in spatial structure of the shorter and longer wavelength ism emission .",

    "( at 4.9 @xmath0 , the residual ipd emission is also reduced because the 100 @xmath0 ism template contains some residual ipd emission as well . )    in this derivation of the near - ir emission there are two important assumptions .",
    "the first is that the near - ir emission of the ism within the high - latitude regions of interest is similar to that which is measured at low latitudes by this procedure .",
    "the bright source blanking at low latitudes removes most of the compact emission sources ( mainly h ii regions ) in the area where the ism colors are derived . the remaining emission may still arise from ism with different properties than those of the local high - latitude ism , but the residual maps ( figure  [ gcr_maps ] ) give no indication of differences between the unblanked low and high latitude ism emission .",
    "the second assumption is that any near - ir emission of the cib can be neglected in this analysis . at the low galactic latitudes where the ism colors are derived",
    ", stellar emission is likely to be much stronger than the cib emission .",
    "additionally , the slopes of the correlations , which indicate the ism colors @xmath193 and @xmath197 , should not be seriously affected by any isotropic emission , such as that of the cib .",
    "the value of the foreground subtracted maps ( figure  [ gcr_maps ] ) as estimators of the cib intensity depends upon of the uncertainties associated with the data and foreground models .",
    "we distinguish two classes of uncertainties .",
    "random uncertainties , such as those arising from the detector noise , are associated with errors exhibiting gaussian or poisson statistics . in general ,",
    "random uncertainties can be reduced by averaging large amounts of data ( i.e. over large regions of the sky , and over the entire mission ) and do not contribute significantly to the total uncertainty of the residual maps .",
    "systematic uncertainties , such as those associated with the detector offsets , affect many or all data in a similar fashion and thus do not average out as the size of the data set increases .",
    "the following sections describe our estimates of the most significant systematic uncertainties associated with each step of the foreground removal process .",
    "the calibration of the dirbe data requires the measurement of instrument gain and offset terms .",
    "errors in the measurement of these quantities will affect all data in a similar fashion .",
    "the evaluation of the gain and offset uncertainties is described in the _ cobe _ dirbe explanatory supplement ( 1997 ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the detector gains and offsets are listed in table  [ tab_errors ] .",
    "gain errors will have little impact on the significance of a detected background signal , because the ipd and ism models are scaled directly to the dirbe data .",
    "the fsm is not scaled to the dirbe data directly , but does use the dirbe absolute calibration for conversion from magnitudes to flux densities .",
    "a gain error will cause us to overstate or understate the levels of the residual signal _ and _ its total uncertainty by a multiplicative constant .",
    "the detector offset uncertainties are much more important .",
    "they represent minimum uncertainties that can not be reduced . a true background signal",
    "must at least exceed the offset uncertainties to be detected .",
    "the detector offset uncertainties are worst for the 140 and 240 @xmath0 bands .",
    "after averaging over the entire mission , random instrumental noise is only apparent in the 140 and 240 @xmath0 maps as a graininess visible at the fainter high latitudes .",
    "however , averaging over regions larger than @xmath36 30 pixels ( @xmath198 sr @xmath199 deg@xmath200 ) , reduces the uncertainty from the instrumental noise to levels below that of the total systematic uncertainties . at shorter wavelengths ,",
    "the instrumental noise is dwarfed by the systematic uncertainties even on the scale of a single pixel .",
    "the uncertainties and errors in the subtraction of the emission and scattered light from the ipd are reported in paper ii . of these uncertainties ,",
    "the one likely to be most significant is that arising from uncertainty in the geometry of the interplanetary dust cloud .",
    "the adopted geometric kernel does not uniquely or perfectly describe the data , and consequently we are required to associate systematic errors to the residual intensities that are roughly proportional to the mean intensity of the ipd at each wavelength .",
    "these uncertainties are listed in table  [ tab_errors ] .",
    "the systematic uncertainty associated with the removal of galactic stellar emission has two sources .",
    "first , there is uncertainty associated with the bright source blanking . at some locations the blanking may remove confused sources which are individually below the bright source threshold , but",
    "are combined by the dirbe beam into a single source above the threshold .",
    "the result of this effect is to reduce the mean level of the background when measured over large regions .",
    "we have used the faint source model to estimate the frequency with which we expect to find pairs of sources in the same dirbe pixel , where both sources are within a factor of 2 of the bright source threshold .",
    "the number of such double sources at latitudes @xmath67 ranges from @xmath36 140 at 1.25 @xmath0 to @xmath36 6 at 4.9 @xmath0 .",
    "the uncertainties caused by these sources are listed in table  [ tab_errors ] .",
    "a more important source of systematic uncertainties in the removal of stellar foreground emission is the accuracy of the faint source model .",
    "systematic errors in the faint source model are not strictly isotropic , but occur on large angular scales such that averages over large patches usually do not reduce the errors .",
    "the clearest indication of systematic errors in the faint source model is the presence of gradients with respect to galactic latitude in the residual emission at 1.25 to 4.9 @xmath0 .",
    "the correlations between these gradients and the fsm at @xmath201 are used to derive the uncertainties reported in table  [ tab_errors ] .",
    "the gradients indicate that low latitude emission is oversubtracted relative to the high latitude emission , but they can not indicate at which latitude ( if any ) the subtraction is correct .      we have estimated two contributions to the uncertainty associated with the subtraction of the ism .",
    "the first is the uncertainty of the background level that is removed from the 100 @xmath0 map to make the ism template ( see sections 5.2 , 5.3 ) .",
    "any error in this value is propagated into the residual intensities measured at other wavelengths .",
    "the uncertainty in the 100 @xmath0 background intensity is taken to be the difference in the intercepts of the correlations between the h i and 100 @xmath0 emission at the nep and at the lockman hole ( section 5.2.1 ) , which were used to derive the 100 @xmath0 background intensity .",
    "this uncertainty would be larger if we had determined the background using a larger region of the sky , where there would be stronger and less well known contibutions from molecular and ionized components of the ism .",
    "the 100 @xmath0 instrumental offset and ipd uncertainties are added in quadrature to this ism uncertainty before the value is propagated to other wavelengths .",
    "the other ism uncertainty is that associated with the scaling factors , @xmath11 , used to convert the 100 @xmath0 ism emission into ism emission maps at other wavelengths .",
    "these uncertainties were estimated by subdividing the region of sky used to determine @xmath11 into @xmath36 18 regions , and then calculating @xmath11 for each subregion .",
    "the rms variation of @xmath11 for the set of subregions was used as the uncertainty for the global @xmath11 applied in the ism subtraction .",
    "this uncertainty characterizes the variations in the ism spectrum on angular scales of @xmath202 .",
    "both of the systematic uncertainties associated with the ism subtraction are listed in table  [ tab_errors ] .",
    "after removal of the ipd and galactic ir foregrounds , the total uncertainty attributed to the residual background intensity at each wavelength is calculated as the quadrature sum of the systematic uncertainties ( @xmath203 ) discussed above and listed in table  [ tab_errors ] .",
    "in constructing the fsm , we attempted to reproduce the model described by wainscoat et al .",
    "( 1992 ) as closely as possible .",
    "this preserves the model s basis in source counts and independence from the actual intensity of the cib .",
    "the only modification made to the model in order to improve its fit to the dirbe data was the addition of an 18 pc offset of the sun above the galactic midplane .",
    "this value is supported by the independent results derived at near - ir wavelengths by cohen ( 1995 ) , and other analyses of the dirbe data ( weiland et al .",
    "1994 ; freudenreich 1996 ) bracket the value used here .",
    "however , the final residual maps in the near - ir bands ( fig .  [ gcr_maps ] ) , and the gradients with respect to galactic latitude ( table  [ tab_gcr_grad ] ) clearly indicate that the fsm has overaccounted for the stellar emission .",
    "this suggests the possibility of adjusting the fsm to minimize these gradients . the simplest adjustment would be to apply a global scaling factor to the model intensities",
    "such a factor could arise if there were an error in the flux attributed to 0magnitude stars in the fsm .",
    "the scaling factors required to minimize the galactic latitude gradients of the residual maps are 0.859 , 0.792 , and 0.674 at 1.25 , 2.2 , and 3.5 @xmath0 , respectively . however , these adjustments are significantly larger than the @xmath204 gain uncertainties expected at these wavelengths ( _ cobe _ dirbe explanatory supplement , 1997 ) .",
    "these scaling factors could also be attributed to errors in the absolute magnitudes of 0.165 , 0.253 , and 0.428 magnitudes for all source types at 1.25 , 2.2 , and 3.5 @xmath0 , respectively . if these scaling factors are applied to the fsm , then the residual intensities at high galactic latitude increase by factors of @xmath362 in all three bands .",
    "alternatively , we can use the star count data from the seven 2mass fields to optimize the fit of the fsm to this independent data set . to minimize the @xmath101 statistic for the comparison of the @xmath56 and @xmath9 band data simultaneously",
    ", we find that the fsm star counts ( number of stars / mag / deg@xmath63 ) need to be reduced by a factor of 0.952 to match the 2mass data .",
    "such a change in the number density of stars in the fsm would eliminate about 1/2 of the gradient that is observed in the residual maps .",
    "changes that optimize the fit to the 2mass star counts do not simultaneously minimize the residual gradients in the dirbe data .",
    "none of these scaling changes were applied to either the intensities or the number densities of the stars in the fsm in the present analysis because we sought to keep the fsm tied closely to the star counts , and because we are unable to determine the physical cause of the apparent discrepancy between the fsm and the dirbe data .",
    "the ir emissivity and colors of the ism derived in this paper differ somewhat from those found in other analyses . using the dirbe data , but a different method for removing the ipd emission , boulanger et al .",

    "dwek et al .",
    "( 1997 ) presented an analysis of an ism spectrum that was derived in a similar manner to that presented in table  [ tab_bx_b8 ] , but using an earlier version of the ipd emission removal than that used in this work ( paper ii ) .",
    "the high latitude ism spectrum presented here is considered an improvement on that presented by dwek et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , though differences are generally @xmath206 10% and within the adopted uncertainties .",
    "dwek et al .",
    "( 1997 ) find that the ism spectrum is well fit by emission from silicate grains , graphite grains , and pahs , all heated by the mean interstellar radiation field .",

    "the amount of carbon in graphite grains , pahs , and as c@xmath208 ions is found to be consistent with cosmic abundances .    at 240 @xmath0",
    "the results of the two - component ism model ( ism2 ) indicate that it is important for a model of galactic ir emission to account for spatial variation in the dust temperature .",
    "the contrast between figure  [ gcr2_10 ] and figure  [ gcr_maps ] shows this is especially relevant at low latitude ( @xmath209 ) .",
    "however , because of the increased noise in the ism2 model , it remains unclear how important temperature variation is at high latitudes .",
    "a two - component model , similar in form to the ism2 model used here , is also required to model the galactic emission observed by the _ cobe_/firas experiment ( fixsen et al .",
    "another recent study using both dirbe and firas data ( lagache et al . 1998 ) decomposes the ism emission into warm ( @xmath3617.5 k ) and colder ( @xmath3615 k ) components .",
    "the distribution of this cold component ( figure 5 of lagache et al .",
    "1998 ) is very similar to that of the 140 and 240 @xmath0 residual emission after removal of the one - component ism model ( figure 12 ) . in this two temperature model ,",
    "the apparent temperature variations revealed in the long wavelength colors are ( at least in part ) a result of varying proportions of the warm and colder ism components on different lines of sight .",
    "there are several numbers presented in this paper that should not be used as estimates of the cib , despite their appearances .",
    "these include extrapolation of the @xmath68 or @xmath210 gradients discussed in sections 4.3 and 5.3 , intercepts of the correlations between @xmath109(100 @xmath0 ) and @xmath89(h i ) ( and other ism tracers ) discussed in section 5.2 , and the intercepts of the correlations of other dirbe intensity maps with the 100 @xmath0 ism template discussed in section 5.3 .",
    "the main reason these numbers are not reliable estimates of the cib is that they are derived from regions chosen for characterization of the galactic foreground , not for accuracy or completeness of removal of the galactic and other foregrounds .",
    "frequently these regions include entirely or in part areas where the galactic emission is relatively strong , and small fractional errors in the foreground removal could still have large influences on the derived intensity of the cib .",
    "a more useful investigation of the cib should focus on regions of the sky where errors in the foreground removal have minimal impact on the derived cib .",
    "a proper analysis of the cib also needs a demonstration that the residual emission is isotropic , rather than just providing a single intensity estimate that may average over anisotropic defects in the foreground removal .",
    "such a study of the cib is presented in paper i. any conclusions concerning the cib should be drawn from that paper .",
    "we have modeled and removed the galactic ir emission in the dirbe data in preparation for analysis of the cib .",
    "the procedures used were designed to preserve the emission of the cib in the residual maps , and not remove it inadvertently with the galactic emission .",
    "the procedures concentrated on producing accurate results at high latitudes where galactic emission is weakest . at low latitudes , deficiencies in the models are clearly visible in the residual maps .",
    "we find that the stellar emission of the galaxy is reasonably reproduced by our faint source model , which is based on the sky model ( wainscoat et al .",

    "each tracer of ionized gas has advantages and disadvantages .",
    "pulsar dispersion measure is a measure of ionized gas column density , but it pertains to a single line of sight rather than the solid angle sampled by the dirbe beam , and it can significantly underestimate the total ionized column density along the line of sight if the pulsar is not above most of the ionized gas layer .",
    "the h@xmath87 data used here were measured with a beam comparable to the dirbe beam , and sample the entire path through the galaxy .",

    "another disadvantage of using h@xmath87 is that it can be affected by extinction .",
    "an extinction correction has been applied to the h@xmath87 intensities used here assuming the ratio of extinction coefficient to h@xmath87 emissivity is constant along each line of sight ( uniformly mixed extinction and emission ) , and the optical depth at h@xmath87 is 0.04 @xmath89(h i ) where @xmath89(h i ) is in @xmath121 cm@xmath26 . with these assumptions ,",
