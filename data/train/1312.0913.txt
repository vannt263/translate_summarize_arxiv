    "once labeled , we call such a pair an _ oriented filling pair_. a filling pair without the extra structure of an orientation is an _ ordinary filling pair_.    the action of @xmath9 on ordinary filling pairs lifts naturally to an action on the set of oriented filling pairs . given an oriented filling pair , we obtain an ordinary one by forgetting the orientation .",

    "let @xmath83 denote the permutation @xmath84 which corresponds moving forward by one sub - arc in each of @xmath49 .    in what follows ,",
    "in order to simplify the relevant permutation equations , we will suppress the reference to @xmath1 and @xmath28 when referring to a permutation ( e.g. , @xmath85 will be written as @xmath86 and @xmath77 as @xmath3 ) .",
    "we say that a permutation @xmath87 _ respects parity _ , or is _ parity respecting _ , if @xmath88    [ lm:2 ] let @xmath28 be a minimally intersecting filling pair on @xmath0 .",
    "then the permutation @xmath89 satisfies the equation    @xmath90    conversely , if @xmath91 is a parity respecting @xmath42-cycle which solves the above equation , then @xmath3 defines a minimally intersecting filling pair on @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath92 .",
    "then @xmath93 is the labeling of the edge of @xmath94 immediately following the edge labeled with the @xmath95 element of @xmath75 .",
    "the ordering of @xmath75 has been chosen so that @xmath96 is precisely the element of @xmath75 identified with the inverse arc to @xmath97 .",
    "thus @xmath98 sends @xmath99 to the next arc along whichever curve @xmath99 is apart of , with respect to the chosen orientation of that curve , which is equal to @xmath100 .",
    "conversely , let @xmath3 satisfy the above permutation equation , and suppose further that @xmath3 is an @xmath42-cycle and is parity respecting .",
    "then associated to @xmath3 is a clockwise labeling of the edges of an @xmath42-gon ( up to cyclic permutation ) from the set @xmath101 , such that edges alternate between receiving even and odd labels .",
    "this is simply the labeling obtained by choosing an initial edge of the polygon , and labeling edges in order from the initial edge in accordance with the permutation @xmath3 written in cycle notation .",
    "this produces a labeling of the edges by the elements of @xmath75 , which we in turn interpret as a gluing pattern ; each edge glues to its inverse .",
    "thus we obtain a closed surface @xmath102 , which is orientable because each edge is glued to one which is oppositely oriented .",
    "it remains to check that the euler characteristic of the surface is @xmath103 , and that the boundary of the polygon projects to a minimally intersecting filling pair .",
    "@xmath104 is equivalent to there being @xmath24 equivalence classes of vertices under the gluing .",
    "indeed , the permutation equation ensures that each equivalence class contains precisely @xmath27 vertices ; as seen in figure @xmath18 , the vertex @xmath105 separating the edges labeled @xmath106 and @xmath107 glues to the vertex separating the edges labeled @xmath108 and @xmath109 .     and @xmath107 share a vertex in common along the boundary of the polygon @xmath94 , then @xmath108 and @xmath109 must also share a vertex in common , and these two vertices are glued together to obtain @xmath102 . iterating",
    "this argument shows that each gluing class contains @xmath27 vertices.,width=336 ]    similarly , the vertex separating @xmath108 and @xmath109 is glued to the vertex separating @xmath110 and @xmath111 , which in turn glues to the vertex separating @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "finally , this fourth vertex glues to @xmath105 and the cycle is complete .    by the same analysis",
    ", the terminal vertex of @xmath106 is identified to the initial vertex of @xmath109 , and therefore the @xmath53-arcs are concatenated in the quotient to produce a single simple closed curve @xmath53 , and similarly for the @xmath55-arcs .",
    "we also note that if a permutation in @xmath72 is an @xmath42-cycle and parity respecting , it must send each even number to an odd number .    henceforth , any permutation satisfying the requirements of lemma [ lm:2 ] ( being an @xmath42-cycle , parity respecting , and satisfying the permutation equation ) will be called a _ filling permutation_.    filling permutations parameterize oriented filling pairs .",
    "therefore , in order to count ordinary filling pairs , it suffices to count filling permutations , and divide by the number of distinct orientations which a fixed ordinary filling pair admits .",
    "lemma [ lm:3 ] characterizes which filling permutations correspond to the same ordinary filling pair :    [ lm:3 ] if @xmath114 are two minimally intersecting filling pairs on @xmath0 in the same @xmath9-orbit , then @xmath115 , modulo conjugation by permutations of the form @xmath116 where @xmath117 @xmath118 @xmath119    if @xmath120 and @xmath121 are _ oriented _ filling pairs in the same @xmath9 orbit , there is a homeomorphism of @xmath0 taking @xmath120 to @xmath121 , which lifts to a homeomorphism of the @xmath42-gon that is simplicial in the sense that it fixes the boundary and sends edges to edges and vertices to vertices .",
    "the only option for such a map is a dihedral symmetry of the regular euclidean @xmath42-gon ; since the map must also be orientation preserving , this leaves rotation as the only option . thus the filling permutation for @xmath121 , written in cycle notation ,",
    "is obtained from that of @xmath120 by a cyclic rotation , and thus determines the same underlying permutation of @xmath72 .    however , in general there will exist oriented filling pairs which are not in the same @xmath9 orbit , but whose underlying ordinary filling pairs are . nevertheless , the fiber of the map from oriented pairs to ordinary pairs is in @xmath122 correspondence with the set of distinct orientations with which one can equip an ordinary pair .",
    "fixing an ordinary filling pair , any choice of orientation can be obtained from any other by simply choosing a different initial arc along @xmath53 ( corresponding to conjugating by a power of @xmath123 ) or @xmath55 ( conjugating by @xmath124 ) , reversing the direction of @xmath53 ( conjugating by @xmath125 ) , and interchanging @xmath53 and @xmath55 ( conjugating by @xmath126 ) .",
    "we call permutations of the form @xmath127 _ twisting _ permutations .    in light of lemma [ lm:3 ] , to obtain a lower bound on @xmath14 , it suffices to find a lower bound on the set of filling permutations , and divide by an upper bound on the number of twisting permutations . since @xmath123 and @xmath124 both have order @xmath24 and @xmath128 are involutions , there are at most @xmath129 such permutations .",
    "let @xmath28 be an oriented minimally intersecting filling pair on @xmath0 , and label the intersections @xmath130 in accordance with the chosen direction along @xmath53 .",
    "we first describe a way of `` extending '' @xmath28 to a minimally intersecting pair on @xmath131 ( see remark [ rk:1 ] for an explanation of why we do not extend to @xmath132 ) .    fix some @xmath133 . to create a minimally intersecting filling pair on @xmath131",

    "according to the oriented edge labelings , the four green vertices are identified.,width=288 ]    [ rk:1 ] it is unclear how to attempt such a construction by extending a minimally intersecting filling pair on @xmath0 to one on @xmath132 .",
    "our construction works by finding a pair of simple closed curves on @xmath163 intersecting @xmath150 times , and such that any other simple closed curve intersects their union at least twice .",
    "the key point here is that the arcs on @xmath139 fill in the _ arc and curve sense _ , meaning that no essential arc or simple closed curve is disjoint from their union .    to extend a minimally intersecting filling pair on @xmath0 to one on @xmath132 in this fashion , we would need a pair of simple closed curves on @xmath164 intersecting @xmath27 times such that any other simple closed curve intersects their union at least twice . one way of guaranteeing this is to choose a pair of curves that are distance @xmath47 in the farey graph .",
    "however , if a curve is distance @xmath47 or more from the @xmath165 curve , it must intersect @xmath165 at least @xmath166 times ; since @xmath167 acts transitively on the vertex set of the farey graph , the same is true for any vertex .",
