    "synchronization is an interesting dynamical phenomenon exhibited by interacting oscillators in diverse areas of science and technology  @xcite .",
    "it has become an area of active research since the identification of synchronization in chaotic oscillators  @xcite . in recent years , different types of synchronization and generalizations",
    "have been reported both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite . among them ,",
    "inverse or anti - synchronization  @xcite constitutes an important class of synchronization , which is a typical feature of dynamical systems interacting through inhibitory coupling .    by definition ,",
    "inverse synchronization is the phenomenon  @xcite where the state vectors , say the drive @xmath4 and the response @xmath5 , of the synchronized systems have the same absolute values but of opposite signs , that is @xmath6 .",
    "while this is inverse complete synchronization , one may also identify inverse anticipatory synchronization where the response anticipates the drive , that is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a constant .",
    "similarly , when the response system lags the drive , one has inverse lag synchronization , that @xmath9 , @xmath8 .",
    "just as in the case of regular synchronization , especially in nonlinear dynamical systems with inhibitory coupling , one may encounter all the above types of inverse synchronization for appropriate ranges of the parameters .",
    "the importance of inhibitory or repulsive coupling is well acknowledged in biological systems .",
    "it is a well established fact that couplings between neurons are both excitatory and inhibitory  @xcite .",
    "ecological webs typically have both positive and negative connections between their components  @xcite .",
    "coupled lasers with negative couplings have also been widely studied  @xcite .",
    "the well known swift - hohenberg and kuramoto - sivashinsky equations include such a term  @xcite .",
    "currently , it has also been realized that a large class of natural networks also have inhibitory interactions among the nodes  @xcite .",
    "the first experimental observation of inverse synchronization was demonstrated in coupled semiconductor laser diodes  @xcite , in which it was established that inverse synchronization was caused by nonresonant coupling between the drive and the response lasers .",
    "it was also shown that switching between synchronization and inverse synchronization was possible by slightly changing the pump current of the drive laser  @xcite .",
    "experimental observations and numerical simulations of synchronization and inverse synchronization of low frequency power drop - outs and jump - ups of chaotic semiconductor lasers were carried out in  @xcite .",
    "inverse synchronization was also observed both experimentally and numerically in unidirectionally coupled laser systems with optical feedback  @xcite , as well as in a class of chaotic delayed neural networks  @xcite and in coupled ikeda systems with multi - feedback and multiple time - delays  @xcite .",
    "inverse anticipating synchronization was demonstrated in coupled ikeda systems  @xcite .",
    "further inverse retarted / lag synchronization and the role of parameter mismatch were discussed in  @xcite .",
    "however it may be noted that in none of the above studies the role of inhibitory coupling was investigated .    despite the fact that a vast amount of literature is now available on the phenomenon of synchronization ,",
    "inverse synchronizations have not been studied adequately , in particular with inhibitory couplings between interacting dynamical systems . in this paper , we report inverse synchronizations ( inverse anticipatory , inverse complete , and inverse lag synchronizations ) in unidirectionally coupled time - delay systems with inhibitory coupling .",
    "we also present a sufficient stability condition for asymptotic stability of the synchronized state following the krasovskii - lyapunov functional approach for the cases where ( i ) the coefficients of the @xmath0 ( error variable ) and @xmath1 ( error variable with delay ) terms of the error equation corresponding to the synchronization manifold are constant and ( ii ) the coefficient of the @xmath2 term is constant and that of the @xmath3 term is time dependent . we show that there is a transition from inverse anticipatory to inverse lag synchronization through complete inverse synchronization as a function of the delay time in the coupling .",
    "the tools to get these results are similarity function , probability of synchronization and largest lyapunov exponents of the coupled time - delay systems .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we deduce a sufficient condition for the asymptotic stability of the synchronized state for a system of unidirectionally coupled scalar delay differential equations with inhibitory coupling .",
    "we consider a piecewise linear delay differential equation as an example for the case where the coefficients of both the @xmath2 and @xmath3 terms in the error equation are constant and demonstrate the existence of different types of inverse synchronization as a function of the coupling delay in sec .",
    "using the paradigmatic ikeda system in sec .",
    "iv for the case where the coefficient of the @xmath3 term is time dependent while that of the other is time independent , we show that the same general stability condition is valid for the asymptotic stability of different types of inverse synchronizations again as a function of the coupling delay .",
    "we also demonstrate these dynamical transitions through numerical analysis . finally , in sec .",
    "v , we summarize our results .",
    "consider the following unidirectionally coupled drive , @xmath4 , and response , @xmath5 , systems with inhibitory coupling of the form    @xmath10    [ eq.one ]    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are positive parameters , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the feedback and the coupling delays , respectively .",
    "the nonlinear function @xmath16 is chosen to be a piecewise linear function which has been studied in detail recently  @xcite , @xmath17    as the first example , and @xmath18 which is the well known ikeda system  @xcite , as the second example .",

    "( [ eq.one ] ) , as @xmath22 the above evolution equation ( [ eq.difsys1 ] ) corresponding to the error function of the inverse synchronization manifold is inhomogeneous and so it is difficult to analyse the system analytically .",
    "nevertheless , the evolution equation can be written as a homogeneous equation @xmath23 for the specific choice of the parameters @xmath24 therefore , we will concentrate on this parametric choice .",
    "the inverse synchronization manifold @xmath25 corresponds to the following distinct cases :    1 .",
    "inverse anticipatory synchronization occurs when @xmath26 with @xmath27 , where the state of the response system anticipates the inverse state of the drive system in a synchronized manner with the anticipating time @xmath28 ( whereas in the case of direct anticipatory synchronization , the state of the response system anticipates exactly the state of the drive system , that is , @xmath29 ) .",
    "inverse complete synchronization results when @xmath30 with @xmath31 , where the state of the response system evolves in a synchronized manner with the inverse state of the drive system ( whereas in the case of complete synchronization , the state of the response system evolves exactly identical to the state of the drive system , that is , @xmath32 ) .",
    "3 .   inverse lag synchronization occurs when @xmath33 with @xmath34 , where the state of the response system lags the inverse state of the drive system in a synchronized manner with the lag time @xmath28 ( whereas in the case of direct lag synchronization , the state of the response system lags exactly the state of the drive system , that is , @xmath29 ) .    the synchronization manifold corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ eq.difsys ] ) is locally attracting if the origin of the above error equation is stable .",
    "following the krasovskii - lyapunov functional approach  @xcite , we define a positive definite lyapunov functional of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an arbitrary positive parameter , @xmath37 .",
    "it is to be noted that for the above error equation ( [ eq.difsys ] ) , the coefficient of the @xmath2 term is always constant while that of the @xmath3 term can be time dependent .",
    "hence one can obtain two cases depending on the choice of the nonlinear functional form @xmath16 . if the derivative of the function turns out to be a constant as in the case of the piecewise linear function , eq .",
    "( [ eqoneb ] ) , one obtains a constant coefficient for the @xmath3 term . on the other hand , if the derivative still depends on time as in the case of the ikeda system , eq .",
    "( [ eqonec ] ) , then the @xmath3 term always has a time dependent coefficient . in the following",
    ", we will show that the same general stability condition derived from the krasovskii - lyapunov approach can be valid for both the cases for the asymptotic stability of the different types of inverse synchronizations .",
    "however , there also arises an even more general situation where the coefficients of both the @xmath2 and @xmath3 terms are time dependent . in this case",
    "the arbitrary positive parameter @xmath36 in the lyapunov functional is no longer a positive constant .",
    "we have also designed a suitable coupling form for this rather general situation , for which we can show that the same general stability condition arrived from the krasovskii - lyapunov approach is still valid for the asymptotic stability of the synchronized state ; these results will be published elsewhere .",
    "note that from eq .",
    "( [ klf ] ) , @xmath38 approaches zero as @xmath39 .",
    "hence , the required solution @xmath40 to the error equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq.difsys ] ) , is stable only when the derivative of the lyapunov functional @xmath38 along the trajectory of eq .",
    "( [ eq.difsys ] ) is negative .",
    "this requirement results in the condition for stability as @xmath41 again @xmath42 as a function of @xmath36 for a given @xmath43 has an absolute minimum at @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "since @xmath46 , from the inequality ( [ eq.ineq ] ) , it turns out that a sufficient condition for asymptotic stability is @xmath47 this general stability condition indeed corresponds to the stability condition for inverse anticipatory , complete inverse and inverse lag synchronizations for suitable values of the coupling delay @xmath15 corresponding to a fixed value of the feedback delay @xmath14 for both the piecewise linear and ikeda time - delay systems corresponding to the cases where the coefficient of the @xmath3 term in the error equation is time independent and time dependent , respectively .",
    "further , it is interesting to note that if one substitutes @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.one]b ) , then the coupling becomes excitatory for the choice of functional forms we have chosen .",
    "this is exactly the case we have studied in  @xcite , where direct anticipatory , complete and lag synchronizations exist as a function of the coupling delay .",
    "however , one can not obtain inverse ( anticipatory , complete and lag ) synchronization with excitatory coupling or direct ( anticipatory , complete and lag ) synchronization with inhibitory coupling for the chosen form of the unidirectional nonlinear coupling because of the nature of the parametric relation between @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the stability condition ( [ eq.asystab ] ) .",
    "now from the form of the function @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ eqoneb ] ) for the piecewise linear time - delay system , one can obtain a less stringent stability condition as  @xcite @xmath49 while @xmath50 is the most general condition specified by ( [ eq.asystab ] ) for asymptotic stability of the synchronized state @xmath40 .",
    "correspondingly , one can obtain the stability condition for the coupled ikeda systems as @xmath51     ( a ) the first ten maximal lyapunov exponents @xmath52 of the piecewise linear time - delay system ( ( [ eq.one]a ) and ( [ eqoneb ] ) ) for the parameter values @xmath53 @xmath54 and ( b ) hyperchaotic attractor for the delay time @xmath55 with two positive lyapunov exponents for the above values of the other parameters . here",
