    "we show that the bogoliubov - de gennes equation has solutions describing bound states that are localized around the junction and decay exponentially into the superconductors .",
    "these bound states play a central role in the dc josephson effect . the physical picture that emerges out of the solution",
    "is that the supercurrent flows as a result of multiple andreev reflections @xcite that transform an electron into a hole or vice versa .",
    "the bound states represent standing waves of electron and hole waves going back and forth between two superconductors .",
    "this view might look slightly different from a traditional picture of the dc josephson effect explained in textbooks , according to which the supercurrent , calculated in lowest order in the tunneling hamiltonian , flows as a result of tunneling of cooper pairs .",
    "in fact , these views are simply two sides of a same coin .",

    ", however , it was not fully appreciated that the presence of current - carrying bound states is a general feature in any symmetric josephson junctions including weak links , superconducting quantum point contacts , and conventional tunnel junctions .",
    "the bound states in a short junction or a point contact , whose energy depends on the phase difference of the superconductors , were explicitly constructed by solving the bogoliubov - de gennes equation in @xcite .",
    "it is a curious fact that almost no attention was paid to the bound states in earlier studies of short superconducting weak links @xcite , in which the bound states show up silently as poles of the green s function on the real axis .",
    "in fact , the andreev bound states play a central role for various situations in mesoscopic superconducting systems .",
    "in this paper we will concentrate on the dc josephson effect of @xmath0-wave superconductors . when a finite voltage is applied across the junction ,",

    "we therefore introduce a scattering potential @xmath32 to describe such a scattering .",

    ". the same expression of the supercurrent interpolating the two limits has been found by many people @xcite .",
    "the phase - dependent bound state energy ( [ eq : e_b ] ) and its implication to the josephson effect in short junctions were emphasized in @xcite .",
    "the results were then generalized to the multichannnel contacts in @xcite .    equation ( [ eq : e_b ] ) shows that there is always a bound state ( andreev level ) with @xmath76 unless the phase difference @xmath77 is zero .",
    "this is true even for the tunnel junctions in which @xmath68 and @xmath78 . in the above model two bound states ( @xmath79 )",
    "appear in the energy gap @xmath80 but disappear when @xmath81 .",
    "this is a general property of short @xmath0-wave junctions where @xmath82 with @xmath83 being the length of the normal region ( @xmath84 in our model ) . in the opposite regime",
    "where @xmath85 , many ( @xmath86 ) andreev levels exist in the gap for any @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "these andreev levels are easily understood as discrete levels of normal electrons confined in a quantum well of @xmath87 pair potential .",
    "they are similar to the discrete energy levels in a vortex in an @xmath0-wave type ii superconductor @xcite .",
    "a nontrivial observation we made in the above calculation is that , when @xmath88 , two andreev levels survive even in the limit @xmath89 , in sharp contrast with a case where a particle is confined in a quantum well of diagonal potential barrier , in which no bound state exists in the limit @xmath89 .",
    "= 1.5 in    the bound state @xmath90 is formed as a result of resonant multiple andreev reflection process .",
    "equation ( [ eq : i_b ] ) shows that this state carries nonvanishing supercurrent .",
    "this can be physically understood as follows ( fig .",
    "[ fig : andreev ] ) .",
    "each time an electron is andreev reflected into a hole , a cooper pair is effectively generated .",
    "therefore the bound state , which represents an infinite loop of andreev reflections ( electron@xmath91hole@xmath91electron@xmath92 ) , serves as a pump that transfers cooper pairs from one superconductor to the other .",
    "when @xmath93 the bound state energy has a strong dependence on the phase difference @xmath77 , which can be controlled externally by the current source .",
    "it would be very interesting if these current - carrying andreev levels are observed experimentally using , for example , the scanning tunneling spectroscopy .",
    "finally we comment on midgap states that appear near the surface of a @xmath1-wave superconductor when the surface is not parallel to a crystal axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dwave ] ) @xcite .",
    "in fact the mechanism of the formation of the zero - energy midgap state is the same as the andreev bound states we discussed above . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dwave ] , an electron traveling towards a surface is reflected back into the @xmath1-wave superconductor and is subsequently andreev - reflected into a hole by the _ positive _ pair potential . in the next step the hole follows the same path backwards , reflected at the surface , and finally andreev - reflected into another electron by the _ negative _ pair potential .",
    "the analogy to the josephson junction is now obvious .",
    "the surface of the @xmath1-wave superconductor plays a role of the point contact with @xmath70 , and the sign change in the pair potential corresponds to the phase difference @xmath72 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : e_b-2 ] ) tells that there must be bound states with @xmath75 localized near the surface , which are the midgap states found in ref .",
    "they give rise to a peak in differential conductance of a normal  insulator@xmath1-wave tunnel junction @xcite .",
    "the andreev levels also play an important role in a josephson junction made of an @xmath0-wave superconductor and a @xmath1-wave superconductor @xcite .",
    "it is known that in such a junction there is a chance that andreev levels appear even in the lowest - energy state , thereby leading to a ground state with broken time - reversal symmetry @xcite .",
    "we shall introduce a general expression of the dc josephson current under the assumption that we can ignore the spatial variation of the pair potential . here",
    "we assume @xmath94 in the normal region ( @xmath95 ) the order parameter vanishes .",
    "we also assume that the potential @xmath3 is independent of @xmath96 in the superconductors .",
    "we emphasize that this step - function pair potential ( [ eq : delta(r ) ] ) is a good approximation for mesoscopic josephson junctions of our concern , where bulk superconductors are coupled via a few conduction channels .",
    "the use of the step - function model is justified by the following reasons .",
    "first , the presence of a point contact does not seriously affect the order parameter of bulk superconductors , because the width of the constrictions is much smaller than the superconducting coherence length @xmath97 , which is the characteristic length scale for the variation of the order parameter .",
    "second , if the normal region is made of a material different from superconducting electrodes , the contact resistance of the sn interfaces is not small due to the fermi - velocity difference and/or due to the presence of a schottky barrier . in this case also the pair potential is not reduced significantly near the point contact . more generally , when the resistance of the junction is much larger than those of superconductors , we may safely use the step - function model @xcite .",
    "since the dc josephson current is an equilibrium current , it is given by the thermal average of @xmath98 .",
    "we calculate it at @xmath46 to avoid complication due to the source term @xmath25 : @xmath99 \\biggr|_{x=0 } , \\label{eq : i = g_omega_n}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is the temperature green s function at frequency @xmath101 in the nambu space ( @xmath102 matrix ) @xcite .",
    "our assumption that the order parameter @xmath7 and the potential @xmath3 have no dependence on @xmath96 in the superconductors , is strong enough that we can immediately write down @xmath100 at @xmath103 in terms of scattering amplitudes .",
    "its explicit expression can be found in ref .  @xcite . after substituting it into eq .",

    "equation ( [ eq : i = a - a ] ) expresses the supercurrent in terms of the scattering data @xmath109 , just like the landauer formula does the normal - state conductance .",
    "an important difference is that the supercurrent is proportional to the scattering amplitude , not to the probability .",
    "equation ( [ eq : i = a - a ] ) is clearly an odd function of @xmath77 , and can be expanded formally as @xmath110 .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath111 corresponds to @xmath112th order term in the tunneling hamiltonian approach that is a contribution from the simultaneous tunneling of @xmath112 cooper pairs .",
    "equation ( [ eq : i = a - a ] ) is thus a useful , nonperturbative formula for the dc josephson current @xcite .",
    "let us apply it to the simple one - dimensional model we analyzed in the last section . solving the bogoliubov - de gennes equation for @xmath113 with potentials given by ( [ eq : delta(x ) ] ) and ( [ eq : u(x ) ] ) gives @xmath114 }        { e^2(1+z^2)-\\delta^2_0[\\cos^2(\\varphi/2)+z^2]}. \\label{eq : a(varphi , e)}\\ ] ] note that the scattering amplitude has poles at @xmath79 . substituting ( [ eq : a(varphi , e ) ] ) with @xmath115 into ( [ eq : i = a - a ] ) , we then find @xmath116 } , \\label{eq : i = sum_omegan}\\ ] ] which agrees with eq .",
    "( [ eq : i_b ] ) after the frequency sum is evaluated by reducing into a contour integral . in this calculation",
    "all the contributions to the integral come from the residues at @xmath79 .",
    "this proves that the andreev bound states carry the whole supercurrent in short symmetric josephson junctions .",
    "we note that this is not true for long weak links where @xmath85 @xcite and for asymmetric junctions where @xmath117 .",
    "let us examine the latter case in more detail .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional model where the pair potential is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta(r ) ] ) with @xmath84 and the diagonal potential is ( [ eq : u(x ) ] ) .",
    "a solution of the bogoliubov - de gennes equation for this model gives a scattering amplitude for @xmath118 , @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : i = a - a ] ) we obtain @xmath122 where @xmath123 .",
    "this result agrees with the ambegaokar - baratoff formula @xcite for a tunnel junction in the limit @xmath124 and with the kulik - omelyanchuk formula @xcite for a point contact with perfect transmission in the limit @xmath125 .",
    "the summation can be reduced to an integral over @xmath126 plus contributions from residues at energies of bound states at @xmath127 .",
    "the integral over @xmath128 corresponds to the process shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : asymmetry ] and carry most of the supercurrent .",
    "in a superconducting quantum point contact , the critical current or the maximum value of the dc josephson current can take a quantized value in units of @xmath129 .",
    "this was first predicted theoretically @xcite and confirmed by experiments @xcite .",
    "the effect can be understood easily by the following argument .",
    "the critical current of a josephson junction is generally proportional to its normal - state conductance , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : i_b-2 ] ) .",
    "it is well known that the conductance of a quantum point contact fabricated in a 2deg is quantized in units of @xmath130 @xcite : the conductance is simply @xmath130 times the number of open channels at the constriction .",
    "we can thus naively expect that the critical current should be quantized as well . for a more quantitative discussion we can use the adiabatic approximation where",
    "scattering between channels is neglected .",
    "the transmission probability through the quantum point contact is then @xmath131 for open channels and @xmath132 for closed channels . for a short symmetric superconducting quantum point contact where @xmath82",
    ", we obtain , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : i_b-2 ] ) and ( [ eq : i = a - a ] ) , @xmath133 where @xmath52 is the number of open channels at the point contact .",
    "we thus find that the critical current is a multiple of @xmath129 at zero temperature .",
    "the number of open channels is determined by the width of the constriction , which can be controlled externally , for example , by changing a gate voltage for a 2deg .",
    "this was done in an experiment by takayanagi _",
    "_ @xcite .    equation ( [ eq : nko ] ) is valid only for short junctions . in the opposite case where @xmath85 , the unit of the quantization is different .",
    "the supercurrent for a long superconducting quantum point contact is given by @xmath134 for @xmath135 at zero temperature , where @xmath136 is the longitudinal component of the fermi velocity in @xmath107th channel .",
    "in this case the critical current is not exactly quantized in contrast with the short - junction limit .",
    "this is nothing but a quantum limit of long sns junctions obtained in early 1970s @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have reviewed the dc josephson effect in mesoscopic josephson junctions .",
    "our discussion is based on a simple analysis of the bogoliubov - de gennes equation . in short junctions including superconducting quantum point contacts the whole supercurrent is carried by andreev bound states in the energy gap that appear as a result of multiple andreev reflections .",
    "the wave function of a bound state is constructed explicitly for a simple @xmath33-function model by solving the bogoliubov - de gennes equation .",
    "the bound state energies are sensitive to the difference of the phases of superconductors , and this sensitivity is the origin of the josephson effect .",
    "our simple physical view of the josephson effect in terms of the current - carrying bound states is very general and applicable to many situations .",
