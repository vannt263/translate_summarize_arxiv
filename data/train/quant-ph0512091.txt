    "at present , due to invention of laser as a coherent quantum generator , the dynamical problem of optimal reception of optical signals with quantum noise , taking into account the fundamental limitations caused by the quantum nature of the electromagnetic waves , is becoming actual .",
    "quantum information and communication theory which has been developing so far ( see recent review @xcite and the references in there ) is based on static ( nontemporal ) , or single step ( instantaneous ) theory of quantum measurement , and quantum statistical inference does not take into account physical  causality in due coarse of the dynamical propagation . as the result , the optimal estimators based on nontemporal quantum measurements are noncausal since they may depend at each intermediate time @xmath0 not only on the past but also on future results of measurements .",
    "an attempt to develop the temporal , multistep variant of quantum measurement and decision theory to solve the problems of the dynamical filtering in discrete time was made in @xcite .",
    "however , because of the very restrictive class of quantum measurement process as a sequences of independent , nonadaptive quantum measurements considered in this paper , even the simplest gaussian problem for quantum linear filtering ( quantum kalman filtering ) was not solved , with the exception of a degenerated case , and no time - continuous generalization is possible within this restricted method .    here",
    "we show , while solving the filtering problems for a quantum diffusion , that these difficulties can be avoided if a natural much wider class of temporal adaptive quantum measurements is considered , assuming their dependence not only on time , but also on the results of preceding measurements .",
    "our dynamical model for the temporal quantum causal measurements has a natural time - continuous setup based on quantum stochastic differential equations .",
    "an appropriate quantum measurement device , that realizes the adaptive measurements , is called the nonanticipating ( or causal ) quantum filter with a memory .",
    "the optimization of estimation based on independent quantum measurements in the narrower class of filters without memory is in our treatment a problem with constraints leading to a poorer quality of filtration .",
    "as is proved below , the optimal time - continuous filtering of markov gaussian signals with the background quantum white noise is realized by a quantum linear filter based on the adaptive coherent quantum measurements .",
    "the optimal filter has a markov memory such that the next optimal quantum measurement in general depends on the result of the present measurement but is independent of the preceding measurement results in this markovian case .",
    "we show that such coherent quantum filter can be realized by indirect heterodyne measurements adding an independent vacuum quantum noise , and by causal processing of the temporal measurement results using a classical linear kalman - bucy filter @xcite .",
    "a nonlinear ( and quasi - linear ) generalization of this result for the non - gaussian case , which corresponds to the classical nonlinear filtering theory of stratonovich bib:4 , is also of our interest an will be considered elsewhere .",
    "let us first consider a physical model of quantum open system with output channel , in which the problem of optimal quantum filtering arises naturally , giving a solution of this problem .",
    "then we shall set up a general rigorous formulation of the filtering problem as the problem of quantum optimal temporal estimation , and derive the solution of this problem in the gaussian case .",
    "let us consider an electromagnetic oscillator with frequency @xmath1 loaded on a pair of communication channels , the transmission lines which are described by wave conductivity @xmath2 and wave resistance @xmath3 respectively , as shown in the figure , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and propagation velocities of the waves @xmath7@xmath8 , @xmath9 are assumed to be equal : @xmath10 :        we consider the case when the lines are homogeneous and that the measuring device ( receiver ) which is set at their outputs of the lines @xmath11 and @xmath12 is ideally conjugated with these lines such that there is no reflection of the received information ( i.e. incoming waves @xmath13 ) into the radiated noise ( i.e. outgoing waves @xmath14 ) at the end of the lines .",
    "such system is open , but it is entirely described by the dynamic variables of voltage @xmath15 and current @xmath16 on the contour @xmath17 , and by the pairs of running waves @xmath18of current and voltage in the first and second lines respectively as the solutions to the telegraph wave equations .",
    "the boundary conditions @xmath19 , @xmath20 induce on the open oscillator the following pair of langevin equations @xmath21where the second pair of equations , corresponding to these boundary conditions , determines the output waves running from the oscillator to the receiver .",
    "assuming , for simplicity , that the following gage invariance condition @xmath22 is fulfilled , the above system of equations can be written in the one - dimension complexified form @xmath23 in terms of the complex amplitudes @xmath24    now we move from the langevin towards a stochastic description of the corresponding quantum system . in the classical case , assuming that the input noise @xmath25 , radiated by the receiver at the time @xmath26 , is the equilibrium noise of the temperature @xmath27 , we can treat it as a complex circular - invariant white noise with the intensity given by the nyquist formula @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 is the boltzman constant ) . in the quantum case complex amplitude @xmath30 should be replaced by the corresponding operator @xmath31 in the heisenberg picture , satisfying the canonical commutation relations @xmath32\\equiv \\check{x}(t)\\check{x}% ( t)^{\\ast } -\\check{x}(t)^{\\ast } \\check{x}(t)=\\hbar \\check{1}\\,,\\;\\ ; \\label{eq:1}\\]]where @xmath33 is the hermitian adjoint operator and @xmath34 is the unit operator in the hilbert space of quantum - mechanical states of this system ( @xmath35 is the planck constant , @xmath36 is the annihilation operator for oscillator quanta at the time @xmath0 ) . by virtue of linearity the corresponding heisenberg equation for",

    "as shown in @xcite , the above equations and commutation relations can be obtained by a canonical quantization of any open oscillator in  the rotating wave  representation and the narrow - band approximation . introducing the notations @xmath48for the forward and backward waves at the input and output of the transmission line of length @xmath49 respectively ,",

    "<S> time - continuous non - anticipating quantum processes of nondemolition measurements are introduced as the dynamical realizations of the causal quasi - measurements , which are described in this paper by the adapted operator - valued probability measures on the trajectory spaces of the generalized temporal observations in quantum open systems . in particular , the notion of physically realizable quantum filter is defined and the problem of its optimization to obtain the best a posteriori quantum state is considered . </S>",
    "<S> it is proved that the optimal filtering of a quantum markovian gaussian signal with the gaussian white quantum noise is described as a coherent markovian linear filter generalizing the classical kalman filter . as an example , the problem of optimal measurement of complex amplitude for a quantum markovian open oscillator , loaded to a quantum wave communication line , is considered and solved .    </S>",
