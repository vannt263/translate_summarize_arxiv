    "since quetelet s advocacy of `` social physics '' in the 1830s  @xcite and ravenstein s seminal work later in the nineteenth century  @xcite , quantitative studies of human mobility have suggested that human movements follow statistically predictable patterns  @xcite .",
    "such systems - level studies are an important complement to individual - based approaches , as they can reveal population - level phenomena that are difficult to deduce by focusing on the characteristics of isolated members @xcite .",
    "research that takes a physics - based approach has focused predominantly on modern mobility  rather than historical mobility and migration  because of the disproportionate availability of large , rich data sets from modern life  @xcite . by contrast , historical data tend to be sparse , incomplete , and noisy .",
    "these constraints limit the scope of conclusions that one can draw about how humans mingled , mixed , and migrated over long time scales  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we investigate historical human mobility and associated human migration by studying the matchmaking process for traditional marriages in korea combined with modern census data in south korea .",
    "we obtain our data from korean `` family books '' called _ jokbo _ (  in korean ) .",
    "such a confluence of historical and modern data is rare , and it allows a novel test of generative models for human mobility .    according to korean tradition",
    ", family names are subdivided into clans called _ bon - gwan _ (  ) , which are identified by a unique place of origin .",
    "for example , the two korean authors of this paper belong to the clans `` kim from gimhae (   ) '' and `` lee from hakseong (   ) '' , and the clan `` lee from hakseong '' is distinct from the clan `` lee from jeonju (   ) '' [ the royal clan of the joseon dynasty and the great korean empire ( 13921910 ) ] .",
    "when two koreans marry , the bride s clan and her birth year are customarily recorded in the _ jokbo _ owned by the groom s family .",
    "these _ jokbo _ are kept in the groom s family and passed down through the generations ; they serve primarily as a record of the names and birth years of all male descendants  @xcite . in previous work , researchers used the marriage data contained in these books to estimate the population sizes and distributions of clans in korea as far as 750 years in the past @xcite . such distributions are useful for understanding quantitative aspects of human culture , and we proceed even further by conducting a systematic investigation of the geographical information embedded in _",
    "we examine a set of ten _ jokbo _ to try to understand how geographical separation affected human interaction in the past in korea .",
    "specifically , we examine how interclan marriage rates can be predicted by physical distance and how clans themselves have spread across the country during the past several hundred years . to do this",
    ", we apply two generative models for describing human mobility patterns to _ jokbo _ records of past marriages between two clans .",
    "note that the identification of clans with specific geographical origins is not unique to korea .",
    "for example , the origins of british and czech surnames were also the subject of recent investigations  @xcite .",
    "our analysis consists of two parallel approaches .",
    "first , we use marriages recorded in _",
    "jokbo _ to obtain snapshots of migration ( mainly of individual women ) for a `` marriage - flux analysis '' .",
    "we apply two generative models for population flow , discuss the results of applying these models , and explain the limitations that arise from the wide variety in the geographical - distribution patterns of the clans .",
    "second , to consider the geographical spread of clans in more detail , we conduct an `` ergodicity analysis '' .",
    "we use the modern geographical distribution of clans from census data to infer `` ergodicity '' of clans ( mainly caused by past movement of male descent lines ) . to provide an additional perspective",
    ", we also use these data to construct a network model of population flows . to the best of our knowledge , the notion of diffusive versus convective population flow is new for data - driven studies of human mobility and migration , and we believe that this kind of approach can provide valuable insights for many problems in population mobility and migration . in the present paper , we focus on long - term migration , which has significant effects on many processes over a variety of spatial and temporal scales .",
    "such processes include urban population growth and the demographic structure of cities @xcite ; city infrastructure and planning @xcite ; unemployment @xcite ; and the spread of culture , religion , and other ideas @xcite .",
    "most early studies of migration emphasized so - called `` internal migration '' ( i.e. , movement within a country ) @xcite like the phenomena that we investigate , though international migration is also a prominent field of study  @xcite .",
    "it has been more popular to study international migration than internal migration during the past few decades , but present - day urbanization processes in asia , africa , and latin america have led to renewed interest in internal migration  @xcite . we hope that our work provides useful ideas to help solve some of the fundamental questions in the migration literature : who migrates , why people migrate , and the consequences of migration ( e.g. , rural depopulation ) .",
