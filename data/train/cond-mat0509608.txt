    "in the last few years there has been an increasing interest for the intermittent fluorescence of new nanomaterials @xcite , which for this reason have been called @xcite _ blinking quantum dots _ ( bqd ) .",
    "the theoretical interest for these new materials is due , to a great extent , to the properties of their power spectrum .",
    "pelton , grier and guyot - sionnest @xcite , as well as chung and bawendi @xcite , have studied macroscopic samples of quantum dots , and have proved that they generate @xmath0 noise .",
    "thus , understanding these new materials is a problem directly connected with the origin of the @xmath0 noise , an issue that according to the proponents of self organized criticality ( soc ) should be settled using their theoretical perspective @xcite .",
    "the search for the dynamical origin of complexity , meant to be a statistical condition departing from the poisson prescription , is a hot topic , and recently another proposal of approach to complexity , called _ superstatistics _ , was made by beck and cohen @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", there is an increasing conviction @xcite that anomalous diffusion , and especially sub - diffusion , might find a satisfactory theoretical framework in the _ subordination _ perspective . in this paper we shall illustrate the subordination perspective with physical arguments , and",
    "shall refer to this theoretical approach simply as subordination .",
    "here we limit ourselves to saying that according to the original work of montroll and weiss @xcite , the time distance between two consecutive jump events , generating the walker diffusion , is not fixed but is randomly drawn from a distribution of waiting times .",
    "this is a case used to generate a new form of diffusion ( anomalous ) , through subordination to the ordinary diffusion .",
    "the subordination perspective is also be applied to generate anomalous fluctuation - dissipation processes . in this case",
    "the original events are processes where diffusion is balanced by friction . by assuming that the time distance between two consecutive events of this kind is not fixed , we derive a non - ordinary fluctuation - dissipation process subordinated to the ordinary one @xcite .",
    "subordination yielding anomalous transport can be imagined as a theoretical perspective where the collisional events generating randomness are rare and separated by large time intervals with a non - exponential distribution .",
    "this important property requires , in turn , a physical explanation that hopefully might relate the deviation from exponential distribution to the cooperation among the elementary constituents of the system . the subordination perspective is based on the assumption that the phenomenon under study is a _ renewal _",
    "one , insofar the jump occurrence is assumed to reset to zero the system s memory .    in the case of bqd fluorescence , many researchers have been studying the microscopic origin of intermittency , and , on top of that , of why the intermittency of these materials is characterized by non - poisson distribution of times of sojourn in the @xmath1 , with the system emitting light , and _  off \" _ state , with the system emitting no light @xcite . to first sight , all these papers seem to share the same theoretical perspective as superstatistics . according to cohen @xcite , the process yielding the deviation from the canonical distribution",
    "is realized by the system as follows .",
    "the particle resides in a cell in local equilibrium for a time extended enough as to reach the corresponding canonical equilibrium , then it moves to another condition of local equilibrium , and so on , in such a way that the resulting distribution will turn out to be distinctly non - exponential , insofar as the superposition of many exponential functions with different probabilistic weights is not an exponential function .",
    "the sojourn in a condition of local equilibrium must be extended in time enough for the system to adapt itself to this condition .",
    "for this reason superstatistics is equivalent to a form of very slow modulation .    the model discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite might be thought of as a form of superstatistics .",
    "in fact , these authors propose a two - state model with barrier height or barrier width fluctuation .",
    "this automatically yields a waiting time distribution as a sum of infinitely many exponential functions , one exponential for each of the barrier heights or widths .",
    "however , as the authors point out , these fluctuations can not be slow .",
    "in fact , the case of slow fluctuations would produce a correlation between two successive on - times or two successive off - times , while the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that no significant correlation of this kind exists .",
    "similar remarks apply to the model of refs .",
    "@xcite . in all these models",
    "there are traps with exponential waiting times distribution densities . however , the system resides in each exponential trap corresponding to a given state , for instance the state  off \" , only once , and it jumps back to the state  on \" before being trapped again in the state  off \" .",
    "this property ensures the renewal property . in conclusion , superstatistics is a form of very slow modulation , whereas renewal is compatible with a theory based on non - exponential distribution densities emerging from the superposition of many exponential waiting time distributions , provided that the system _ does not _ adopt the same exponential well for too many successive trapping events .    as an example of physical process that might be conveniently described by the slow modulation perspective , we quote the interesting recent papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors find @xcite that their experimental result can not be described by the two - state semi - markov models proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , being therefore incompatible with the renewal perspective .",
    "the chronological ordering of the off waiting times suggests the occurrence of a modulation corresponding to molecular conformational changes .",
    "it is therefore convenient to develop a technique of analysis of the experimental data that might help the investigators to establish the real nature of the process under study , namely whether renewal , slow modulation , or an intermediate condition , applies .",
    "this is the main purpose of this paper .",
    "we shall show that , although renewal and superstatistics can be used to produce the same waiting time distribution density , the former approach to complexity generates renewal aging , while the latter does not .",
    "the aging technique has already been adopted by brokmann _",
    "@xcite to prove that the physics of bqd is characterized by renewal . in this paper , in addition to confirming the conclusions of this earlier work , using the same aging technique , we make also an attempt at assessing if a condition intermediate between renewal and very slow modulation ( superstatistics ) might exist .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ renewal0 ]",
    "we show that renewal rests on resetting the system s memory after any event ( collision ) . in section [ modulation ]",
    "we define modulation as a condition of time dependent rate , with no renewal .",
    "we explain the form of modulation adopted in this paper , and we show that in the fast condition it becomes compatible with non - poisson renewal .",
    "we devote section [ aging ] to reviewing the phenomenon of renewal aging and we explain why the condition of very slow modulation should yield no aging . in section [ artificialdata ] , with the help of artificial sequences , we illustrate the aging experiment that we propose for the analysis of experimental sequences . at the same time",
    "we explore the unknown region between renewal and very slow modulation .",
    "we examine and discuss real experimental data in section [ realexperiment ] .",
    "finally , we devote section [ final ] to concluding remarks .",
    "let us consider a two - state renewal process , and , for simplicity , let us assume that the distribution of sojourn times in the state  on \" is the same as the distribution in the state",
    " off `` . this assumption will prevent us from discussing with our techniques the interesting effect recently discussed by verberk _",
    "these authors discussed the case where both distributions have an inverse power law form with different indexes , @xmath2 and @xmath3 and found that a gibbs ensemble of trajectories moving from the beginning of the state ' ' on \" , produce a fluorescence intensity decaying in time as a function proportional to @xmath4 , with @xmath5 .",
    "we leave the discussion of this interesting effect as a subject for future work .",
    "we assign to the survival probability ( sp ) of this process , @xmath6 , the inverse power law form @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "this corresponds to the joint action of the time dependent rate @xcite @xmath9 , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and of a resetting prescription . to illustrate this condition ,",
    "let us imagine the random drawing of a number from the interval @xmath12 $ ] at discrete times @xmath13 .",
    "the interval @xmath14 is divided into two parts , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with @xmath15 ranging from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , and @xmath16 from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "note that @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and , as a consequence , the number of times we keep drawing numbers from @xmath15 , without moving to @xmath16 , is very large .",
    "let us evaluate the distribution of these persistence times , and let us discuss under which conditions we get the sp of eq .",
    "( [ experimental ] ) .",
    "the sp function is the probability of remaining in @xmath15 after @xmath22 drawings , and is consequently given by @xmath23 using the condition @xmath24 , and evaluating the logarithm of both terms of eq .",
    "( [ towardscox0 ] ) , we obtain : @xmath25 the condition @xmath24 implies that @xmath26 and @xmath22 of eq .",
    "( [ towardscox ] ) are so large as to make @xmath27 virtually identical to a function of the continuous time @xmath28 , @xmath29 , with @xmath30 . therefore @xmath31 is a time dependent rate , with resetting as we hereby shall see .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ towardscox ] )",
    "yields the sp of eq .",
    "( [ experimental ] ) , and the corresponding waiting time distribution density , @xmath32 , reads @xmath33    we denote as _ collisions _ the rare drawings of a number from @xmath16 , followed by resetting .",
    "thus the collisions occurring at times @xmath34 , @xmath35 , ... , yield : @xmath36 ; @xmath37 , and so on .",
    "note that @xmath38 means that we _",
    "prepare _ the system at time @xmath39 .",
    "we might adopt a coin tossing prescription to decide whether to keep or to change sign , after any collision .",
    "however , in this paper , as earlier pointed out , we do not pay attention to the problem of fluorescent intensity changing in time as an effect of ensemble average .",
    "thus , for simplicity , our theoretical remarks refer to a sequence @xmath40 , where the times @xmath41 are randomly drawn so as to yield the analytical form of eq .",
    "( [ theoretical ] ) , without assigning to them either an  on \" or an  off \" symbol .",
    "the renewal condition described in section [ renewal0 ] must not be confused with the case of a time dependent rate , with no renewal .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath31 , with no renewal , might obey a deterministic or a stochastic prescription .",
    "an example of the former case is @xmath42 , with no renewal .",
    "we think that the physical process studied by the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite , might be adequately described by a prescripion of this kind , not necessarily periodic , or quasi periodic , reflecting however the molecular conformational changes in time .",
    "the specific cases discussed in this paper are closer in spirit to the condition of stochastic dependence on time .",
    "this means that @xmath31 is a stochastic function of time , so that we have to study :    @xmath43    an interesting example of treatment of this kind is offered by the recent work of brown @xcite .",
    "it has to be pointed out that the evaluation of the characteristic function of eq .",
    "might be a difficult problem , but in the limiting cases of very fast or very slow modulations .",
    "the first condition departs from the non - markov condition of interest for us in this paper",
    ". the latter condition does not , and can be adopted to derive the non - exponential behavior of @xmath6 .",
    "let us assume that the fluctuation @xmath31 has an equilibrium distribution , @xmath44 . in the special case",
    "where the time scale of the fluctuation @xmath31 is virtually infinite , the sp @xmath6 becomes : @xmath45 in fact , let us consider a gibbs ensemble of identical systems , obeying eq .  .",
    "at the moment when the observation begins , at time @xmath46 , each of these systems has a rate @xmath47 , given by the distribution @xmath44 .",
    "if the time scale of the rate fluctuations is virtually infinite , during the observation process each system will keep unchanged its own rate , thereby producing eq .  .",
    "this makes this picture essentially identical to the approach to complexity recently proposed by beck @xcite .",
    "according to a mathematical prescription borrowed from beck @xcite , we find that the analytical expression of eq .   is recovered by using the following form : @xmath48 this proposal was used in a later paper @xcite to develop a new approach to complexity , denoted as superstatistics .",
    "this approach is attracting the attention of an increasing number of researchers ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , and for this reason is worth of consideration .",
    "note that once the inverse power law form of eq .",
    "( [ experimental ] ) for the sp @xmath6 is realized , the corresponding waiting time distribution density is given by @xmath49    in principle , the adoption of the time - dependent rate prescription of section [ renewal0 ] would make it possible to describe modulation processes of any kind .",
    "it would be enough to set @xmath50 and replace @xmath51 with @xmath52 , and make it either deterministic or stochastic .",
    "however , to generate the time series @xmath40 corresponding to the modulation prescription , fast , slow or of intermediate speed , we adopt a different procedure .",
    "we select from the distribution of eq .",
    "( [ christian ] ) the sequence @xmath53 . for any exponential waiting time distribution @xmath54",
    ", we select @xmath55 times , @xmath56 .",
    "a more realistic picture might allow @xmath55 to fluctuate .",
    "we expect , however , that for ordinary fluctuations about a common value @xmath57 , the physics of the process does not change . thus , for simplicity we assign to all the numbers @xmath55 the same value @xmath58 .",
    "the time series to compare to the one derived according to the prescription of section [ renewal0 ] is defined by @xmath59 .",
    "the benefit of this criterion is that @xmath60 makes the resulting time series equivalent to that generated by the models of refs.@xcite and , consequently , to the renewal prescription of section [ renewal0 ] .",
    "@xmath61 + it is important to stress that the ideal condition of totally renewal process and the ideal condition of infinitely slow modulation are characterized by a marked difference concerning ergodicity .",
    "this important issue has been recently discussed by margolin and barkai @xcite . in the totally renewal case , with @xmath62 , the system does not admit any stationary condition @xcite and the stationary correlation function does not exist . the non - stationary correlation function can be defined making an ensemble average , as illustrated , for instance , by the authors of ref .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , on the contrary , adopt a single trajectory picture and study the time averaged intensity correlation function of the bqd signal , supposed to be totally renewal , as well as with identical  on \" and  off \" distribution , as assumed in this paper .",
    "the correlation function is a stochastic property characterized by u- and w - shaped distributions .",
    "the case of infinitely slow modulation would suggest the adoption of an ensemble rather than individual trajectory treatment .",
    "however , in this paper we adopt the individual trajectory treatment also for the case of slow , but not infinitely slow , modulation . it is expected that in this case ergodicity is not violated , in a striking contrast with the condition of total renewal @xcite .",
    "we think that moving from @xmath60 , where the properties found by margolin and barkai @xcite apply , to @xmath63 , where only the ensemble treatment is possible , implies the exploration of an unknown region , of which this paper affords a preliminary treatment . for the reader to appreciate this aspect",
    ", we would like to introduce the concept of pseudo event .",
    "this concept is similar to that proposed in an earlier publication @xcite .",
    "the authors of this paper @xcite found that in some problems of medical interest the connection between scaling and waiting time distribution does not correspond to the prescription of the renewal theory .",
    "this is so as a consequence of the fact that the times of the series under study turned out to be correlated  @xcite .    in the case of modulation",
    ", we define as pseudo events all the drawings of waiting times from the same poisson distribution , after the first drawing . in the case @xmath60",
    "there are no pseudo events . in the case",
    "@xmath64 there is one pseudo event , and so on .",
    "the quantity @xmath65 defines the number of pseudo events per critical event . by critical event",
    ", we denote the drawing of a given poisson parameter @xmath47 . in practice ,",
    "the occurrence of a critical event corresponds to the first drawing of a waiting time from a poisson distribution with rate @xmath66 , namely the time @xmath67 .",
    "the drawing of the next waiting times from the same distribution , implies a subtle deviation from renewal .",
    "this form of correlation is not easy to detect .",
    "in fact , although consecutive sojourn times are drawn from the same poisson distribution , they are by definition independent one from the other . if the time correlation function is @xmath68 , with @xmath69 for a finite portion of the sequence , we expect it to yield @xmath70 , with @xmath71 is the delta of kronecker .",
    "it is a striking and surprising fact that the correlation produced by modulation is invisible to the ordinary correlation test .",
    "this is so because the sojourn times , although derived for an extended period of time from the same poisson distribution , are randomly drawn .",
    "the aging experiment reveals this subtle form of correlation .",
    "we refer to the times that are correlated the ones to the other as pseudo events , regardless the origin of this correlation , which might occur in the form discussed in the earlier publication @xcite or in the even more subtle form of this paper .",
    "we think that the aging reduction depends on the ratio of pseudo to critical events , regardless the origin of correlation . in this paper",
    "we find that the aging reduction depends indeed on the ratio of pseudo to critical events , of the type here introduced . on the basis of this result with artificial sequence ,",
    "we make also an attempt at evaluating the amount of pseudo events that might be present in the real bqd time series .",
    "for an intuitive description of the concept of aging we shortly review the treatment of the earlier work of ref .",
    "the renewal condition of section [ renewal0 ] can also be realized with the following dynamical model .",
    "a particle moves in the interval @xmath72 $ ] driven by the equation of motion @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "when it reaches the point @xmath76 it is injected back in a random position between @xmath17 and @xmath19 with uniform probability , thereby producing another extended time of sojourn within the interval @xmath14 .",
    "the connection between the waiting time distribution density and the uniform initial distribution is given by @xmath77 it is easy to prove that the resulting time distribution density is given again by eq .",
    "( [ theoretical ] ) with @xmath78 and @xmath79    the uniform back injection is equivalent to the resetting prescription of section [ renewal0 ] , and , in fact , this model is renewal , and it is equivalent to the model of section [ renewal0 ] , but its adoption in this section serves better the purpose of explaining renewal aging and the lack of aging in the case of very slow modulation .    the waiting time distribution density given by eq .",
    "( [ fundamental ] ) corresponds to beginning the observation at the moment when the system is prepared in the uniform distribution @xmath80 . as a result of the injection back process this distribution changes upon time change .",
    "if the observation of the first times of sojourn is made at a later time @xmath81 , the corresponding waiting time distribution density is given by @xmath82 the dependence of @xmath83 on @xmath84 is the renewal aging that we want to assess in this paper by means of a suitable numerical experiment .",
    "an exact expression for @xmath83 is available @xcite , but , since it is not expressed as a simple analytical formula , it is not suitable for the practical purposes of this paper . for this reason , we prefer to adopt the expression : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a suitable normalization constant .",
    "the meaning of this approximated expression is evident .",
    "we assume that the first sojourn times observed might have begun prior to @xmath87 , anywhere between @xmath39 and @xmath88 , with the restrictive condition that the earlier laminar region , only one , began at @xmath89 .",
    "actually , the last laminar region might be at the end of a sequel of an arbitrarily large number of jumps , thereby generating corrections to eq .  . in ref",
    "@xcite the accuracy of this approximation , in the case of inverse power law waiting time distributions , was examined , and found to be very good . in this paper",
    "we shall make a discussion of the key results on the aging experiment on bqd systems , taking into account the error associated to this approximated formula .",
    "it is possible to predict that the case of very slow modulation does not yield aging . in the case of a modulated poisson process",
    ", we replace the model of eq .",
    "( [ 52 ] ) with @xmath90 this means that we set @xmath91 and we replace the parameter @xmath92 with the time dependent rate @xmath31 .",

    "( [ 52 ] ) . when @xmath31 does not depend on time , eq .",
    "represents a poisson process .",
    "let us focus our attention on the case where @xmath31 is a stochastic function of time .",
    "if it is very fast , @xmath31 must be replaced by @xmath96 , the process becomes poisson again and it departs from the modulation model adopted in this paper ( see section [ modulation ] ) .",
    "anyway , in accordance to a well known notion , this poisson process does not yield aging .",
    "the model of eq .",
    "( [ poissoncheerfulequation ] ) becomes equivalent to the modulation model of this paper when the fluctuation of @xmath31 is very slow .",
    "we see that the equilibrium distribution coincides with the initial flat distribution .",
    "thus , we can not adopt the departure from the initial distribution as a way to define the system s age . in the case of a virtually infinitely slow modulation ,",
    "the system leaves for a virtually infinite time in a poisson condition , with no aging whatsoever .",
    "this section is devoted to illustrating , with the help of artificial data , a technique of analysis aiming at a quantitative evaluation of the degree of renewal properties of a given time series .",
    "we refer to this kind of analysis as _",
    "aging experiment_.    it is important to notice that the analysis of real data implies the observation of only one single sequence . in this case",
    "we must turn a single sequence into a very large number of sequences of the same age .",
    "the first sequence is the sequence , artificial or experimental , to analyze , beginning at time @xmath39 with the system being located at the beginning of a state , either  on \" or  off \" .",
    "the second sequence is obtained from the first , canceling the first state , namely , shifting the first sequence towards the time origin by the quantity equal to the time duration of the first state , so that the second sequence begins at time @xmath46 , when the system begins sojourning in the second state of the first , or original , sequence . on the same token ,",
    "the third sequence begins at time @xmath46 , when the system begins sojourning in the third state , and so on .",

    "a quantitative definition of amount of aging is more properly done using the sp , defined by @xmath99 rather than @xmath83 .    from now on we denote by @xmath100 and @xmath101 the waiting time distribution densities and the sps , respectively , derived from the experimental data . of course , in the case of artificial data , where the sequence is realized for the specific purpose of producing the function @xmath6 of eq .",
    "( [ experimental ] ) and @xmath97 of eq .",
