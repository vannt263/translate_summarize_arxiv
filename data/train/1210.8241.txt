    "as we know , in the standard model ( sm ) the lepton number of each flavor is separately conserved .",
    "thus lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) decays such as the higgs boson to @xmath0 are forbidden .",
    "however , neutrino oscillation experiments provide strong evidence that the lepton flavor conservation should be violated @xcite .",
    "if lepton flavor violation can be observed in processes involving only sm particles , this would contribute an important probe to physics beyond the sm .",
    "such processes , in particular the higgs boson to @xmath0 decay , deserve attention .",
    "looking into the literature , various sources or scenarios to accommodate lfv interactions have been introduced and analyzed .",
    "for example , adding heavy right - handed neutrinos can give neutrinos mixings and hence lepton flavor violation @xcite .",
    "also , a general two higgs doublet model has lfv interactions due to yukawa coupling matrices which can not be diagonalized simultaneously @xcite . under the framework of supersymmetry ( susy )",
    ", it is well known that nonzero off - diagonal elements of soft susy breaking terms in the leptonic sector ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , to be precisely defined below ) generate lfv couplings . moreover",
    ", the ( total ) lepton number itself may not be conserved . for the susy case",
    ", such @xmath1 parity violating ( rpv ) couplings also give interesting contributions to processes like the higgs boson to @xmath0 decay .    while susy is undoubtedly a popular candidate theory for new physics , its existence so far lacks experimental evidence @xcite .",
    "thus , some simple versions of the supersymmetric model , such as the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model , have faced stringent challenges @xcite .",
    "however , it has been pointed out that there is still room for the ( minimal ) supersymmetric standard model to accommodate existing experimental constraints @xcite .",
    "for instance , the large mass spectrum for the majority of supersymmetric particles around or beyond 1 tev has yet to be probed @xcite .",
    "the heavy spectrum is in accordance with the newly discovered boson mass @xmath7 125 to 126 gev @xcite .",
    "a large portion of the parameter space remains uncovered in versions of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with more free parameters @xcite .",
    "nonuniversality of soft susy breaking masses is also a possible explanation for the nonobservation of supersymmetric signals @xcite .    under the scheme of the mssm ,",
    "various lfv decays such as @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and so on @xcite , as well as the higgs boson to @xmath0 decay @xcite which we put our focus on in this paper , have been discussed . however , in many studies of the mssm , @xmath1 parity is often imposed by hand to prevent proton decay and make the lightest supersymmetric particle a possible dark matter candidate . from the theoretical point of view , @xmath1 parity is _ ad hoc _ and not well motivated so long as the phenomenological ( minimal ) supersymmetric standard model is concerned @xcite . a generic supersymmetric standard model ( without @xmath1 parity imposed ) , on the contrary , not only provides a convenient way to lepton flavor violation , but also has the advantage of a richer phenomenology including neutrino masses and mixings without introducing any extra superfield . under the framework of susy with @xmath1 parity violation ,",
    "there have been some studies @xcite on the issue of lepton flavor violation .",
    "nevertheless , such studies were either limited to particular types of @xmath1 parity violation or did not take @xmath12 into consideration .",
    "while recently both atlas and cms @xcite reported discovery of a boson state which is essentially compatible with a sm - like higgs , more data are needed to pin down its nature , and the flavor violating higgs decay such as @xmath12 is especially interesting at this moment . in this paper , we will investigate thoroughly the lfv higgs boson to @xmath0 decay from susy without @xmath1 parity via full diagrammatic calculations up to one - loop level . under a reasonable choice of the experimentally viable parameter space",
    ", the most significant branching ratios of various rpv parameter combinations will be reported .",
    "note that part of the key results has been reported , with limited presentation of analytical expressions and discussions , in a short letter @xcite .    in following section",
    ", we summarize our basic formulation and parametrization of the generic supersymmetric standard model ( without @xmath1 parity ) .",
    "particularly , the neutral and charged higgs mass terms , including loop corrections ( up to two - loop for the neutral higgs case ) , would be discussed .",
    "then we give a sketch of our calculations and show numerical results from all possible rpv parameter combinations in section 3 .",
    "note that during our analysis we made no assumptions on the rpv parameters .",
    "the mass spectrum of all susy particles as well as the higgs boson are kept within experimental constraints .",
    "finally , we conclude this paper with some remarks in section 4 .",
    "lists of all one - loop diagrams and useful effective couplings will be given in the appendices .",
    "we may be including more details than necessary , particularly in the sense of showing some experimentally uninteresting results .",
    "we include those to give a full picture about the physics involved , so that readers can appreciate the key features leading to the interesting or uninteresting results . some of the lessons one can learn from the analysis would be useful for future studies of other related aspects of the model .",
    "under the same consideration , we give detailed expressions of the couplings involved and the feynman diagrams in the appendices .",

    "however , one should keep in mind that @xmath40 may contain partly the charged lepton states .",
    "it is also worth mentioning here that the down quark and charged lepton yukawa coupling matrix are both diagonal under our parametrization while the up quark yukawa coupling is the product of cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) factors and diagonal quark masses .",
