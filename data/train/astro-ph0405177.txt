    "these indicate that luminous active galactic nuclei ( agn ) at high redshift the build - up phase of a supermassive black hole  are prime sites at which to search for the dust - enshrouded star - burst phase through which , according to the new galaxy - formation paradigm , their massive spheroids necessarily must pass .",

    "the discovery of quasars at @xmath12 ( fan et al .",

    "( 2003a ) . a considerable fraction of the targets have been shown to be luminous submm sources .",
    "interestingly , this fraction appears to have no significant dependence upon redshift .",

    "( 2003b ) .",
    "sources were observed using scuba ( holland et al .",
    "1999 ) on the jcmt on the nights of 2003 january 31 and february 01 ( ut ) .",
    "simultaneous observations were made at 850 and 450@xmath16 m using photometry mode ( placing the source on the central bolometers h7 , c14 of the two arrays respectively ) with a 60 arcsec azimuth chop at 7.8hz .",
    "data were taken in groups of 40 samples , with observations repeated until @xmath17mjy was achieved .",
    "telescope pointing was checked hourly , and found to be better than 3 arcsec .",
    "mars and uranus , along with irc@xmath310216 , were used as primary and secondary calibrators respectively .",
    "the derived , mean , flux conversion factors were 213@xmath18jy / v ( 850@xmath2 ) and @xmath19jy / v ( 450@xmath2 ) , with a variation of @xmath20 seen over the course of the observing period .",
    "the sky opacity was measured using sky - dips and the recently commissioned water vapour radiometer that measures the direct line - of - sight atmospheric extinction .",
    "observing conditions on both nights were moderately good , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( zenith atmospheric transmission at @xmath23 between 79  90% and 72  76% ) respectively .",
    "data were reduced using both the semi - automated orac - dr pipeline data reduction package ( jenness & economou 1999 ) and a custom reduction procedure based on a series of routines taken from the surf reduction package ( jenness & lightfoot 1998a , b ) . in each case , the final flux represents the weighted ( by the individual rms ) average taken of all data for a particular source / filter combination .",
    "the initial analysis of the sdss j1148@xmath35251 dataset revealed considerable variation between both the flux and rms of the individual 40-sample data groups .",
    "one explanation of this discrepancy was revealed upon the subsequent publication of a mambo-2 image of sdss j1148@xmath35251 by bertoldi et al .",
    "it seemed feasible that our fixed , azimuth chop had placed the off - source position over a second , millimetre - bright source in the quasar field during the latter stages of our observation . in order to eliminate this possibility",
    ", we therefore obtained subsequent scuba photometry on sdss j1148@xmath35251 , in uk service time during the nights of 2003 july 9th , 10th and 12th .",
    "this time , a specified chop throw , and position angle fixed relative to ra  dec , were chosen to avoid the potential contaminant sources .",
    "the atmospheric extinction during the observing period was low ( with @xmath24 ) and the sky stable .",
    "guided by these new , more reliable and consistent observations , we reanalysed the initial datasets , testing alternative explanations for their disagreement .",
    "the measured flux densities of the three sources are tabulated in table  1 , along with the observational parameters of the three sources . for comparison , the mm fluxes , taken from bertoldi et al .",

    "the superscripts and subscripts in columns 4 and 5 give the @xmath25 upper and lower values of the flux ratios .",
    "also listed are the equivalent numbers for the fiducial single - temperature sed model of a quasar at the mean redshift of the @xmath12 sample , @xmath26 , based on a fit to a sample of @xmath6 quasars by priddey & mcmahon ( 2001 ) .      * sdss j1630@xmath34012 ( z=6.05 ) * not detected in either the 850@xmath2 or 450@xmath2 filters ; also undetected at 1.2 mm .    *",
    "sdss j1048@xmath34637 ( z=6.23 ) * detected at neither 850@xmath2 nor 450@xmath2 . based on the detection at 1.2 mm ( bertoldi et al .",
    "2003 ) , the scuba 850@xmath2 limit is deep enough that we should have been able to detect the source with a @xmath27 significance were its emission at 1.2 mm to be characteristic of a greybody at @xmath28 .",
    "our non - detection thus suggests that the dust in this object is colder than @xmath29k .    * sdss j1148@xmath35251 ( z=6.43 ) * the most optically luminous of the three sources , detected at both 850@xmath2 and 450@xmath2 with fluxes of @xmath30mjy and @xmath31mjy respectively  one of very few quasars at @xmath6 where this has been achieved .",
    "the observed fluxes are not consistent with a priddey & mcmahon ( 2001 ) single - temperature sed as can be seen in figure  1 .",
    "this can be seen more clearly in figure  2 a ",
    "c , where the 850@xmath2/1.2 mm and 450/850@xmath2 ratios have been plotted as a function of redshift , both for the single - temperature model ( locus ) and for a selection of high - z quasars , including those observed in this sample . the observed flux ratios are discrepant at the @xmath25 level , however are well within the @xmath32 limits .",
    "the three sources observed show quite different submm properties , in spite of their similar absolute b - band ( @xmath33 ) magnitudes ( column [ 3 ] in table  2 ) , and so inferred blackhole / bulge masses ( see column [ 10 ] in table  2 ) .",
    "this is not surprising as , to date , it has not been possible to establish a correlation between the optical luminosity of a quasar and the submm emission from its quasar host galaxy using samples of radio - quiet , optically loud quasars at @xmath6 and @xmath34 ( isaak et al .",
    "2002 ; priddey et al .",
    "what is striking , however , are the detections at both 850@xmath2 and 450@xmath2 of sdss1148@xmath35251 .",
    "it is not possible to fit the two fluxes reported here and the 1.2 mm flux with a single - temperature sed parameterised by @xmath35 , and @xmath36 ( see figure  1 : solid line )",
    ". a better fit can be achieved , with a much hotter characteristic dust temperature @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ( figure  1 : dotted line ) , or using a two - component model with a cool component characterised by @xmath39 and a hotter component with @xmath40 .",
    "however , we stress that there are insufficient data points to constrain such a two - component model .",
    "if , in the first instance , we assume that the underlying sed is indeed best characterised by a single - temperature , then there are a number of different factors that need to be explored to establish the origin of the anomalous flux ratios , which can be broadly grouped into those that result in an anomalously high millimetre flux , and those that may result in systematically low submm fluxes . however , it is clear that observations with a higher signal - to - noise are urgently needed in order to better constrain the model fitting .",
    "furthermore , the high photometric precision of alma , of order a few percent , will be crucial for future analyses of this type .",
    "if we assume that the observed 850@xmath2 flux is correct , then there are a number of observational and physical reasons why the observed 1.2 mm and 450@xmath2 fluxes might deviate from values expected for a single - temperature sed model :    * relative calibration : * calibration at mm and long - submm wavelengths is relatively straightforward , particularly under periods of high and stable atmospheric transmission .",
    "a comparison of calibrators common to jcmt and iram by lisenfeld and collaborators suggests that the calibrator fluxes measured at 850@xmath2 and 1.2 mm are consistent with thermal sed profiles .",
    "we have included calibration errors of 10  15% in our plotted rms estimates .",
    "accurate calibration at 450@xmath2 , however , is far more difficult with small , temporal variations in atmospheric extinction , ( @xmath41 ) , contributing significantly to the final , overall flux .",
    "we estimate that the combined random and systematic error in the individual flux measurements to be about 30% .",
    "we have included calibration errors in the error - bars plotted in figure  1 , calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the different error components .",
    "* synchrotron contamination : * synchrotron emission can contribute significantly to the observed mm fluxes of radio - loud quasars , with boosting from either the synchrotron tail in the quasar itself , or from a source in its neighbourhood .",
    "vla observations at 43ghz by bertoldi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) place a @xmath42mjy on radio emission from the quasar at 43ghz .",
    "this strongly suggests that the 1.2 mm emission is thermal rather than non - thermal given the positive spectral shape . a search of the nvss ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) and first ( becker et al . 1995 ) radio catalogues did not reveal any radio sources within a 30 arcsec radius of the optical position of the quasar .",
    "the first survey has a 0.138mjy / beam rms at the quasar position ( 1.4ghz ) , which places a @xmath43 upper limit to the synchrotron contamination of the 1.2 mm flux by radio sources in the quasar field of @xmath44mjy , based on the worse case of a flat - spectrum radio source .",
    "* lensing : * gravitational lensing can boost observed flux measurements considerably ( eg . f10214@xmath34724 ( broadhurst & lehar 1995 ) , apm 08279@xmath35255 ( irwin et al .",
    "1998 ; ibata et al . 1999 ) . in general , however , the magnification is achromatic .",
    "thus , all ( sub)mm fluxes would be scaled by the same factor unless the physical extent of the regions emitting at the different wavelengths were quite different  for example , if the mm flux ( @xmath45 ) traced a cooler and , most importantly , highly extended region whilst the shorter wavelength emission traced much more compact emission .",
    "it is not possible to establish this , however , without the high spatial resolution achievable using mm interferometers .",
    "* spectral line contamination : * line contamination of submm continuum fluxes observed in local galaxies is widely recognised .",
    "observations by zhu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have shown that the co(32 ) rotational line can contribute as much as 70% to the 850@xmath2 continuum flux . at @xmath46 the co(32 ) (",
    "@xmath47 ) line is redshifted to 6.46 mm ( 46.4ghz ) , well outside the 1.2 mm and 850@xmath48 filter passbands . under good observing conditions ,",
    "the 1.2 mm filter has an effective pass - band of around @xmath49ghz , which at @xmath50 includes the forbidden , rest - frame far - infrared ( fir ) transition of @xmath51 ( @xmath52=157.74@xmath7 m ) .",
    "significant flux boosting by this line is , however , unlikely : observations with iso have shown that the line - to - fir ratio in local starbursts and ulirgs ( luhman et al .",
    "1998 , 2003 ) is a factor of ten or more lower than that seen in normal galaxies ( 0.11% : ( stacey et al .",
    "if we assume an equivalent filter width of the mambo-2 camera at 1.2 mm of around 80ghz , then the @xmath51 line peak would need to be over 500mjy to account for the excess emission at 1.2mm(1.3mjy ) above that expected for a single - temperature sed fit .",
    "this would be equivalent to a line contribution to the fir luminosity of about 1% . a search by isaak et al .",
    "( 1994 ) for the redshifted @xmath51 emission line in the optically - luminous , radio - quiet quasar br b1202@xmath530725 at @xmath54 placed a @xmath43 upper limit of @xmath55x@xmath56 on the line contribution to the fir luminosity ( equivalent to a @xmath43 upper limit to the line of @xmath57mjy , and to the line - to - continuum ratio of just over 1 in a line - width of @xmath58 ) in this , the most submm - bright of the @xmath6 quasars .",
    "thus , whilst an intriguing possibility , it is unlikely that contamination by @xmath51 is responsible for the high 1.2 mm flux .      if , in contrast , we assume that the 1.2 mm flux is correct , then the observed submm fluxes at 850@xmath2 and 450@xmath2 are a factor of 1.4 and 0.7 lower than one would expect from a single - temperature , @xmath59 sed fit .",
    "the 850@xmath2 detection flux is at @xmath1 and as such is , at first glance , almost @xmath27 below the single temperature fit derived from the 1.2 mm flux .",
    "the statistical significance of the difference however , ranges between @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the @xmath23 flux estimated from the observed 1.2 mm flux when one factors in the uncertainties in the 1.2 mm flux and the error bars in the sed fit itself .",
    "the statistical significance of the difference between the observed and predicted 450@xmath2 flux is much less , as the detection itself is only at @xmath43 .",
    "interestingly , the discrepancy between the observed 450@xmath2 flux and that derived from the 1.2 mm flux ( scale factor of 3.3 from figures  2a  c ) is smaller .",
    "thus , the observations of sdss1148@xmath35251 suggest that the dust emission is not well characterised by a single - temperature sed fit .",
    "one can not , however , attach high significance to this statement because of the relatively low value of the signal - to - noise at 450@xmath2 in particular .",
    "bearing this in mind there is _ very tentative _ evidence that alludes to a change in the properties of the high - z quasar hosts with redshift .",
    "there is a considerable spread in the flux ratios and a more detailed analysis of the seds requires not only very high signal - to - noise data in the 450@xmath2 filter , but also data taken at even shorter wavelengths that match more closely the peak and predicted turnover of the rest - frame sed .",
    "we defer a more detailed discussion of the seds of high - z quasars , as well as tentative trends with redshift to isaak et al .",
    "( in prep .",
    ")      sdss1148@xmath35251 is unique for two reasons : first , on account of its redshift ; second , because it is detected not only at 1.2 mm and 850@xmath7 m , but , uncommonly for a high - redshift quasar , also at 450@xmath7 m .",
    "the consequence of assuming a low @xmath62as suggested by the 1.2mm850@xmath7 m flux ratio  is a prohibitively large dust mass .",
    "this burdens us with explaining how so much dust synthesis could have taken place without the formation redshift being unacceptably high . if , in contract , @xmath62 is high  as suggested by the 450850@xmath7 m ratio  there is no problem accounting for the dust mass , which is small as a result .",
    "this is , however , at the cost of a large fir luminosity . indeed ,",
    "if the dust really is this hot , then the far infrared luminosity approaches the blue luminosity of the quasar , which would suggest that reprocessed agn emission is not the dominant mechanism heating the dust .    notwithstanding the uncertainty in dust temperature , table  2 lists the properties all the targets would have if they were `` average '' @xmath6 quasars , i.e. possessing the @xmath62=40k and @xmath63=2 fit by priddey & mcmahon ( 2001 ) .",
    "the cosmological parameters @xmath64=0.3 , @xmath65=0.7 , @xmath66=65km / s / mpc are assumed .",
    "@xmath67 is the difference in lookback time between redshift @xmath68 and redshift @xmath69 . as in priddey",
    "( 2003b ) we adopt a dust opacity of @xmath70=30@xmath71g@xmath72 @xmath73 is thus the mass of dust .",
    "@xmath74(min ) is the absolute minimum sustained star formation rate needed to synthesise @xmath73 within the available time .",
    "@xmath75 and @xmath76 are the black hole mass and accretion rate calculated from the absolute @xmath77 magnitude ( @xmath33 ) assuming eddington accretion ( eg .",
    "isaak et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ) .",
    "we have , however , shown that observed submm emission from sdss1148@xmath35251 is not consistent with the priddey et al .",
    "( 2001 ) fit . in figure  1",
    "we have considered instead a selection of alternative seds : the `` hot '' model ( @xmath62=180k , @xmath63=0 ) has ( @xmath78 , @xmath73)=(1.1@xmath7910@xmath80l@xmath81 , 0.3@xmath7910@xmath82m@xmath81 ) , whilst the two - component model illustrated has ( @xmath78 , @xmath73)=(2.9@xmath7910@xmath80l@xmath81 , 3.3@xmath7910@xmath82m@xmath81 ) .",
    "the `` mean '' sed , on the other hand , gives ( @xmath78 , @xmath73)=(0.1@xmath7910@xmath80l@xmath81 , 5.3@xmath7910@xmath82m@xmath81 ) .",
    "the rest - frame fir spectral energy distribution is key to determining the thermal origin of the observed submm emission from high - redshift quasars .",
    "the observations presented here suggest that the host galaxies of quasars out to redshifts of @xmath12 are actively undergoing star formation .",
    "multi - wavelength observations spanning the mm and submm are crucial to providing constraints on the dust mass , far - infrared luminosity and inferred star formation rate , thus further exploring the role of star formation in high - redshift quasar host galaxies .",
