    "the random - field ising model ( rfim )  @xcite is one of the best studied glassy magnetic models  @xcite , mainly because of its interest as a simple frustrated system .",
    "in fact , it has been a matter of conspicuous controversy over the last @xmath3 years , mainly concerning the nature of its phase transitions .",
    "the rfim hamiltonian is given by : @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the nearest - neighbors ferromagnetic interaction and the random - fields ( rf s ) are obtained from a discrete distribution @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the disorder strength , also called randomness of the system .",
    "the notion of dimensional reduction  @xcite indicated that the critical behavior of the rfim in @xmath9 dimensions , at sufficiently low randomness , should be identical to that of the well - known normal ising model in @xmath10 dimensions . on the other hand , the droplet theory of domain wall energies in the ferromagnetic state  @xcite suggested that a phase transition should exist in three - dimensions ( 3d ) , for finite - temperature and randomness .",
    "the puzzle has been cleared out by imbrie  @xcite , schwartz  @xcite and bricmont and kupiainen  @xcite .",
    "their arguments strongly support the view that a phase transition in 3d exists for sufficiently small randomness @xmath11  @xcite .    from the experimental point of view , a true realization of the rfim is hardly conceived .",
    "however , it has been shown that dilute antiferromagnets in uniform external field ( daff ) represent physical realizations of the rfim  @xcite and a number of experiments investigated the phase transitions of such 3d systems  @xcite .",
    "these experiments have proven to be very difficult and their interpretation doubtful due to the slow , glassy dynamics of the system .",
    "although there exist several open questions about the phase transition in the rfim , it is now generally accepted that a new fixed point controls the behavior of rf ferromagnets  @xcite .",
    "the significance of this for the rfim ( in @xmath12 ) is that this new zero - temperature random fixed point controls the whole critical line ( @xmath13 ) and that the rf s are always relevant . for disordered systems with weak randomness which couples to the local energy ( such as random - site impurity or random - bond models ) the crossover to a new random fixed point ,",
    "depends on the harris criterion  @xcite . according to this",
    ", the disorder is relevant if the correlation length exponent of the pure model ( @xmath14 ) satisfies the condition @xmath15 and this condition may be stated , with the help of the hyperscaling relation ( @xmath16 ) , as @xmath17 .",
    "since the specific heat exponent of the 3d ising model is positive  @xcite , weak disorder should be expected to be relevant . in the case of the rfim",
    "the type of disorder is much more severe , since the randomness couples to the local order parameter and the crossover renormalization group eigenvalue is always positive  @xcite .",
    "the inequality @xmath18 , derived by chayes _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for the correlation length exponent of a generic disordered system ( @xmath19 ) would imply , using again hyperscaling , a negative specific heat exponent ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "however , it is believed that hyperscaling is violated in the rfim and the specific heat exponent @xmath21 is related to @xmath22 by a modified hyperscaling law @xmath23 .",
    "the exponent @xmath24 characterizes the scaling of the stiffness of the ordered phase at the critical point  @xcite .",
    "thus , the specific heat exponent of the rfim is not restricted , by the above theoretical considerations , to be negative  @xcite .",
    "the inconsistency of various estimations in the literature concerning the critical exponent @xmath21 is the origin of a long lasting lively controversy , leaving open , so far , even the question of divergence or saturation of the specific heat .",
    "the specific heat of the rfim can be experimentally measured and is of considerable theoretical interest .",
    "several monte carlo methods at finite temperatures but also methods using ground state configurations have been used to estimate the critical exponent @xmath21 .",
    "some of the ground state studies came up with strongly negative values , ranging from @xmath25  @xcite to @xmath26  @xcite , whereas middleton and fisher  @xcite estimated in marked disagreement @xmath27 .",
    "experiments on daff provided evidence of a second order phase transition and a logarithmic singularity for the specific heat  @xcite . recently , barber and belanger  @xcite in their monte carlo study of a daff model reported also that their specific heat curve closely mimics a logarithmic peak .",
    "moreover , it has been pointed out that a strongly negative value of @xmath21 causes serious difficulties when it comes to finding a consistent set of scaling relations to describe the critical behavior of the rfim .",
    "these scaling relations are consistent if one uses @xmath28  @xcite , which is also close to the experimental value  @xcite .",
    "clearly more work is needed to understand the specific heats behavior of the model .",
    "this important issue may be intimately linked to the main physical finding of this paper : the violation of self - averaging of the specific heat , illustrated below in sec .",
    "[ section3 ] .",
    "the rfim has been studied numerically using traditional  @xcite but also more sophisticated monte carlo techniques  @xcite",
    ". however , the nature of the model demands enormous computer resources .",
    "the equilibration of the system at low temperatures is exponentially slow for large systems .",
    "furthermore , in order to get a good estimate of the mean properties of the system , it is necessary to repeat the simulations for a large number of realizations of rf s . in the present work",
    "we have applied the new and popular wang - landau ( wl )  @xcite and broad histogram ( bh )  @xcite methods to estimate the density of states ( dos ) , @xmath29 , of the model .",

    "we have applied the described scheme in a broad energy space that covers the overlap of the dominant energy subspaces for all rf s of the ensemble . for a rf realization , say @xmath41 , let us denote by @xmath42 the location of the dominant energy subspace defined by the above restriction , and by @xmath43 its extension .",
    "our simulations were carried out in the broad energy subspace , which covers at least the union of the individual subspaces , i.e. @xmath44},e_{+[m]})\\equiv \\bigcup_{m}(\\widetilde{e}_{-,m},\\widetilde{e}_{+,m})$ ] , of total extension @xmath45}=e_{+,[m]}-e_{-,[m]}$ ] .",

    "this practice has the advantage that the approximation of the specific heat for a particular rf is accurate in a wide temperature range , including its pseudocritical temperature .",
    "thus , the present implementation is not the most efficient for the purposes of locating only the specific heat peaks .",

    "[ fig1 ] shows the fluctuation of the extension of the individual dominant subspaces over the @xmath55 runs .",
    "there are some points that one should observe from this figure .",
    "firstly , in both cases the extension of the cmes for a particular rf is much smaller than the broad energy space used in the simulations .",
    "specifically , for the @xmath53 the dominant energy subspace is approximately of the order of @xmath63 energy levels ( @xmath64 ) , which is almost three times smaller than the @xmath60 levels of the total union space .",
    "secondly , the fluctuations of the extension @xmath65 of the @xmath54 are more pronounced and this is related to the existence of a secondary peak in the left of the main peak .",
    "this secondary peak causes a stronger fluctuation in the estimation of the end points of the corresponding dominant subspaces . in any case",
    ", we could improve the efficiency of our scheme by a factor of at least two ( for the case @xmath58 ) , by carefully individualizing the used energy space for simulating a particular rf .",
    "in fact , the fast early stages of the wl process may be used as a prognostic method to approximately locate the cmes of a particular rf , and this strategy may be an indispensable ingredient in analogous future studies .",
    "finally , an entropic sampling study of the magnetic properties of the rfim using the cmes restrictive entropic scheme based on the high - levels of the wl algorithm  @xcite would be greatly facilitated by such a strategy .",
    "to determine the density of states , we have used the n - fold version of the wl method as presented by schulz  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , using @xmath66 iterations for the reduction @xmath67 of the wl modification factor .",
