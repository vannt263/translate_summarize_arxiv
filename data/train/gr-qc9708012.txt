    "spherically symmetric geometries have a long and useful history as a physically interesting and technically vastly simplified arena for gravitational physics . in vacuum , einstein s theory with spherical symmetry has no local degrees of freedom , and the reduced phase space in the hamiltonian formulation is finite dimensional . including an idealized , infinitesimally thin matter shell brings in an additional finite number of degrees of freedom . including a continuous matter distribution generically yields a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional field theory , with the exception of fields whose gauge symmetries exclude spherically symmetric local degrees of freedom .",
    "a familiar example of a field with such a gauge symmetry is the electromagnetic field .    in this paper",
    "we consider spherically symmetric einstein gravity coupled to an infinitesimally thin null - dust shell . from the spacetime point of view , the solutions to this system are well known ( see , for example , refs.@xcite ) , and they can be easily obtained from a junction condition formalism that is general enough to encompass null shells ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "our purpose is to explore the hamiltonian structure of this system , treating both the geometry and the shell as dynamical . among the extensive previous work on hamiltonian approaches to spherically symmetric geometries ( for a selection in a variety of contexts , see refs . )",
    ", we follow most closely the canonical transformation techniques of kucha @xcite .",
    "our main results can be concisely described as generalizing the spherically symmetric vacuum hamiltonian analysis of ref.@xcite to accommodate a null - dust shell .",
    "finding a suitable action principle requires care .",
    "the shell stress - energy tensor is a delta - distribution with support on the shell history , which is a hypersurface of codimension one .",
    "einstein s equations for the system therefore admit a consistent distributional interpretation @xcite , and the content of these equations is captured by the junction condition formalism of barrabes and israel @xcite .",
    "we recover these equations from a variational principle .",
    "we take the shell action to be that of a spherically symmetric thin cloud of radially - moving massless relativistic point particles , and we vary the total action independently with respect to the gravitational variables and the shell variables .",
    "we shall see that this variational principle can be made distributionally consistent and that the variational equations do reproduce the correct dynamics . achieving this requires , however , a judicious choice of the regularity properties of the metric .",
    "we begin , in section  [ sec : metric ] , by setting up the hamiltonian formulation of the system in the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) gravitational variables .",
    "the spacetime is taken to have kruskal - like topology , with two asymptotically flat infinities , and the spatial hypersurfaces are taken to be asymptotic to hypersurfaces of constant killing time at each spacelike infinity .",
    "the killing time evolution of the hypersurfaces is prescribed independently at each infinity .",
    "we specify the regularity properties of the gravitational variables , and demonstrate that the variational principle is consistent and leads to the correct equations of motion .    in section [ sec : transformation ]",
    "we perform a canonical transformation to a new chart in which the constraints become exceedingly simple .",
    "two of our new variables are hawking s quasilocal mass @xmath4 and the two - sphere curvature radius  @xmath5 , just as in the vacuum analysis of ref.@xcite .",
    "however , to maintain a consistent distributional interpretation of the variables in the new chart , we are led to relate the momentum conjugate to @xmath4 to the  time whose constant value hypersurface coincides with the classical shell history , and not to the killing time as in ref .",
    "the momentum conjugate to @xmath5 needs to be modified accordingly .",
    "remarkably , the canonical transformation can then be chosen to leave the shell canonical pair invariant .",
    "the transformation is mildly singular for geometries in which the shell straddles a horizon , but it can be extended to this special case in a suitable limiting sense .    in section [ sec : reduction ]",
    "we eliminate the constraints by hamiltonian reduction .",
    "the reduced phase space @xmath0 turns out to have dimension four .",
    "as the vacuum theory under our boundary conditions has a two - dimensional reduced phase space @xcite , and as a test shell in a fixed spherically symmetric background has a two - dimensional phase space , this is exactly what one would have anticipated .",
    "we first obtain canonical coordinates @xmath6 in which the configuration variables @xmath7 are the schwarzschild masses on the two sides of the shell .",
    "the momenta @xmath8 can be interpreted as the  time differences between the shell and the infinities , after introducing an appropriate correspondence between our spatial hypersurfaces and hypersurfaces that are asymptotically null .",
    "the configuration variables @xmath7 are constants of motion , while the shell motion is indirectly encoded in the dynamics of  @xmath8 .",
    "these coordinates become singular for horizon - straddling shells , but a global chart covering also this special case can be obtained by introducing suitable new momenta .",
    "we find that @xmath0 consists of two disconnected copies of  @xmath1 , each associated with one direction of the shell motion .",
    "the right - moving and left - moving test shell limits , in which the shell stress - energy tensor vanishes , can be attached to the respective components of @xmath0 as smooth boundaries with topology  @xmath2 .    in section [ sec :",
    "gauges ] we introduce on @xmath0 a local canonical chart in which the shell motion becomes more transparent . assuming that the shell does not a straddle a horizon ,",
    "the shell history divides the spacetime into the  interior , \" which contains a killing horizon bifurcation two - sphere , and the  exterior , \" which does not .",
    "we choose the configuration variables in the new chart to be the curvature radius of the shell two - sphere and the interior mass , in an arbitrarily specifiable stationary exterior coordinate system .",
    "one can argue that this yields a hamiltonian description of interest for an observer who scrutinizes the shell motion from the exterior asymptotic region , especially if the observer s ignorance of the interior asymptotic region is incorporated by setting the interior contribution to the hamiltonian to zero .",
    "we give three examples of stationary exterior coordinate systems in which the hamiltonian can be found in closed form .",
    "also , choosing the spatially flat exterior gauge @xcite , and performing a partial reduction by setting the interior mass equal to a prescribed constant , we reproduce the spatially flat shell hamiltonian previously derived in refs.@xcite by different methods .",
    "in section [ sec : para - times ] we free the evolution of the spatial hypersurfaces at the spacelike infinities by introducing parametrization clocks .",
    "we find on the unreduced phase space a canonical chart in which the physical degrees of freedom and pure gauge degrees of freedom are completely decoupled , in full analogy with the vacuum analysis of ref.@xcite .",
    "the pure gauge chart can be chosen so that the configuration variables are the curvature radius of the two - sphere and the  time , with the latter one appropriately interpreted across the horizons .    in section [ sec : flat - int ] we replace the kruskal spatial topology @xmath9 by the spatial topology  @xmath2 .",
    "the spacetime has then just one asymptotic region , and when the equations of motion hold , the spacetime interior to the shell is flat .",
    "as in the kruskal case , we take the asymptotic region to be asymptotically flat , and we prescribe the evolution of the spatial hypersurfaces at the spacelike infinity",
    ". we then carry out the canonical transformation and hamiltonian reduction .",
    "expectedly , the reduced phase space turns out to consist of two disconnected copies of  @xmath10 , with only the counterpart of the pair @xmath11 of the kruskal theory surviving .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : discussion ] with a summary and a brief discussion , including remarks on the potential utility of the results in view of quantization . some of the technical detail of the adm dynamical analysis is postponed to the appendices .",

    "these special properties of a null shell suggest that our analysis may not be immediately generalizable to timelike shells .",
