    "polarized synchrotron radiation is a powerful diagnostic tool for astrophysical relativistic plasmas .",
    "it provides information on the field direction , degree of order , and in some special situations , the actual field strength .",
    "polarization s diagnostic power ( and its sometimes ambiguous interpretation ) for optically thin sources arise from the combination of two factors  its vector nature , allowing for constructive / destructive interference , and the effects of radiative transfer , primarily faraday rotation , along the line of sight .",
    "there is a long history to the use of radio polarizations for structural studies . in our galaxy ,",
    "polarized emission allowed the mapping of the large scale structure of the magnetic field including very large angle structures such as loop 1 @xcite .",
    "more recently , higher resolution images have uncovered structures on a wide range of scales , including the influence of faraday screens @xcite .",
    "in addition , discrete objects such as supernova remnants and supershells are highly polarized , allowing study of their magnetic field structures and dynamics @xcite .",
    "many extragalactic radio sources were found to be significantly polarized , from the pc - scale relativistic jets of blazars and other agn @xcite to the diffuse lobes of radio galaxies on scales of 100s of kpc @xcite .",
    "in addition to its propitious qualities , polarized synchrotron emission is also important as a foreground for cmb polarization studies @xcite .",
    "polarized objects like the mpc - scale peripheral relics or gischt ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) around clusters of galaxies , presumably due to accretion shocks @xcite were the initial motivation for the current study .",
    "the current work was motivated by a desire to use polarization as a probe to push below the limits of confusion @xcite to search for signatures of infall into and along the large scale filaments that are part of cosmic structure formation @xcite .",
    "although the stokes parameters q , u , and i for linearly polarized emission contain a great deal of information , the way in which they are processed and communicated necessarily destroys some of that information .",
    "in particular , whether or not a vector background subtraction ( in q and u ) or spatial smoothing is done before calculation of the polarized intensity @xmath0^{0.5}$ ] can cause features to appear or disappear in an image .",
    "thus , it is often possible to re - process stokes images and derive further information than emerged from their initial analysis .",
    "it was this type of thinking that led us to reconsider the polarization information present in the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we note that the proper way to recover diffuse polarization information unconfused by smaller sources is to combine single dish and interferometer data .",
    "however , since there are angular scales and rotation measure ranges now reachable by the `` allsky '' nvss that are unlikely to be duplicated in the near future , it is worth examining what information can be derived from this survey .",
    "the nvss is a 1.4 ghz survey ( combining data from 1364.9 and 1435.1 mhz ) conducted from 1993 - 1997 in the d and dnc configurations ( lowest angular resolution ) of the vla , covering the 82% of the sky which is visible from its latitude .",
    "it is reproduced as 2326 4@xmath1  4@xmath2 images in stokes parameters i , q , and u at a resolution of 45 \" .",
    "the rms brightness is @xmath30.45 mjy / beam ( 0.14 k ) , in i , with typical rms values of @xmath30.29 mjy / beam ( 0.09  k ) in q and u at high galactic latitudes .",
    "faraday rotation between the two nvss bands eliminates any polarized emission in the images with @xmath4rm@xmath5 340 rad / m@xmath6 .",
    "the information on large scale structures in the nvss is limited by two effects .",
    "first , the snapshot observations and smallest projected spacings of @xmath337  m produce grating lobes at @xmath318 , effectively eliminating the sensitivity to sources larger than that scale .",
    "in addition , the short spacings were further weighted down in the mapping procedure , to remove the large scale  pedestal \" in the synthesized beam .",
    "although no detailed study has been done , the nvss is generally recognized to have little sensitivity to structures @xmath715. for most extragalactic studies , this provides a great benefit both in total intensity and polarization because it removes the effects of the strong large - scale galactic emission . however , there are many interesting galactic and extragalactic structures on intermediate scales that do not appear in the original survey .",
    "it is possible to recover some of this intermediate scale structure from the nvss linear polarization images .",
    "if a source has structure in q and u on angular scales to which the interferometer is sensitive , then it will be detected even if the underlying total intensity ( i ) is much smoother and undetectable by the interferometer .",
    "q and u often have smaller - scale fluctuations than total intensity because they are sensitive to field disorder , magnetic field direction , and faraday rotation , none of which affects the total intensity .",
    "the recovery of such polarized features is the purpose of our reanalysis ; the nvss  all sky `` images in total intensity and polarization at 800 '' resolution are shown in figure [ allsky ] , dramatically illustrating the larger scale information present in the latter . the processing scheme for these images is discussed in detail below .",
    "we briefly look at what types of features and artifacts are visible in figure [ allsky ] and the additional closer look in figure [ plane ] ( center image ) at a @xmath3100@xmath2 region centered around the perseus arm .",
    "first , we see that the polarization images trace the large scale emission of the galaxy , as seen , e.g. , in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "superposed on the galactic structure are a network of stripes following lines of constant right ascension .",
    "these lines represent series of scans from the nvss survey where the residual instrumental polarization was slightly higher than average .",
    "there are also lines of black dots , each of them one approximately one primary beam ( 34 ) across , where the residual instrumental polarizations were high enough to require flagging in the nvss survey ( w. cotton , private communication , 2008 ) . at the highest declinations ,",
    "the residual instrumental polarization is high at all right ascensions , creating a series of rings around the north celestial pole .",
    "a large number of small sources ( at 800 \" resolution ) are also seen in these images .",
    "these represent both real polarized sources and those caused by residual instrumental polarizations from the very brightest objects in total intensity .",
    "to illustrate the instrumental issues from strong point sources , we consider the case of 3c84 ; it has an nvss flux of 22.15  jy , and an observed polarized flux of 1.9  mjy ( 0.08% ) , showing that the residual instrumental polarization is quite low at full resolution . however , larger sources such as cassiopeia  a ( @xmath35 diameter ) seen in the center of figure [ plane ] are incompletely sampled in the nvss , producing sidelobe structure that puts power into the polarization images . out of cas  a s total flux of @xmath32500  jy , the total polarized flux in figure [ plane ] is @xmath345  jy , or @xmath32% , spread over @xmath31@xmath2 .",
    "although there may be some small real integrated polarization at 1.4 ghz ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the 1@xmath2 extent shows that the bulk of the contribution here is instrumental .",
    "thus , very strong , extended sources can not be reliably studied through this nvss reprocessing .",
    "we consider this effect further below in our discussion of emission around 3c31 .",
    "by contrast with cas  a , there appears to be little or no effect due to the strong total intensity emission from the galaxy , e.g. , on scales of degrees or larger .",
    "this potentially could have been a problem , as @xcite show that the noise in vla visibility data is related to the value of t@xmath8 , which includes contributions both from the sky brightness and spillover radiation from the ground .",
    "however , even in the brightest regions of the galactic plane , we do not appear to have preferentially high polarization ; the brightest region in figure [ plane ] , for example , is in the direction of the cygnus arm , and is indicated by a black circle . within that region ,",
    "the peak ( mean ) brightness is @xmath335  k ( @xmath37  k ) from the @xcite map , while we observe a mean polarized brightness of @xmath320  mk above the background . instead of being higher in this bright region ,",
    "the nvss polarized flux is strongly _ anti - correlated _ with the total intensity emission , likely due to depolarization from the extensive ionized gas seen over this same area @xcite .",
    "@xcite also find a major drop in the number of polarized nvss sources in this area , likely due to depolarization between the two nvss bands .",
    "a subtle problem with nvss polarizations has been described by @xcite , largely resulting from clean biases and small ( @xmath9jy ) offsets in q and u. both of these create problems far below the noise in the nvss polarization images , and even further below the residual instrumental polarization artifacts that are prominent in figures [ allsky ] and [ plane ] , and do not affect the current work .",
    "the key element of our processing is the convolution to larger angular scales of the _ polarized intensity _",
    "maps , instead of the typical procedure of pre - convolving q and u , and then calculating p. such _ pre - convolution _ is generally preferred due to its better noise properties , as well as its preservation of the polarization angle ( @xmath10 ) on the convolved scales .",
    "pre - convolution is also equivalent to observations made with a large synthesized beam or single - dish observation .",
    "however , since there is a maximum angular scale to which interferometers are sensitive , pre - convolution at that maximum scale or beyond would contain no real signal , only noise .    once p is calculated from q and u images at some resolution , further smoothing ( which we term _ post - convolution _ here )",
    "can be performed and arbitrarily large structures can be detected .",
    "similarly , if a large total intensity structure were not smooth , but made up of a collection of small - scale features , it would also be detectable beyond the nominal maximum angular scale .",
    "this process is diagrammed in figure [ pscheme ] .",
    "it shows the production of two maps , and @xmath11  , constructed as described above by pre - convolution followed by post - convolution at a resolution of 800 \" .",
    "the rms scatter in and @xmath11  varies widely across the sky , and contains contributions from three factors - the random noise from the receivers , the actual polarized signal in each region , and the residual instrumental polarization which is most easily evident in the strong declination stripes visible in figure [ allsky ] . during the nvss observations , the focus was on the reliability of the total intensities , and changes in the instrumental polarization",
    "were not closely monitored ( b. cotton , private communication ) . at times when certain declination strips were being observed , larger than normal instrumental effects would arise , e.g. , from phase jumps between the right and left hand receivers on the reference antenna used for polarization calibration .",
    "we illustrate more quantitatively in figure [ noiselong ] how the rms fluctuations in vary across the sky at high galactic latitudes .",
    "we identify the high rms scatter region associated with the actual signal related to the north polar spur , and an adjacent region where the residual instrumental polarization contributions were small .",
    "these can also be seen visually in figure [ allsky ] . in the presence of random noise alone",
    ", we could have corrected for the bias in polarized intensity @xcite .",
    "given the dominance of variable residual instrumental polarization contributions , however , it is not possible to conduct an automated processing scheme for separating the signal / noise / instrumental contributions to the power.therefore , we look at the noise characteristics for each individual source of interest , and describe the observed value in above the local background and rms to estimate its significance .    to remove some instrumental artifacts ( and a first order subtraction of the polarization bias )",
    "we will also be making use of a high - pass filtered version of , which we label @xmath11  .",
    "the high - pass filter consisted of subtracting from each pixel the median of over a box 4@xmath2 in declination ( the size of an individual nvss image field ) by 6 in right ascension .",
    "we estimated the sensitivity to diffuse polarized structures after pre- and post - convolution using a series of simulated polarized signals .",
    "the initial construction of the simulated images ( signal+noise ) is shown in figure [ snscheme ] ; the processing of these images to measure sensitivities is shown in figure [ snoptions ] .",
    "one of the processed ( signal+noise ) images is shown in figure [ fakepol ] . in order to capture all the spatial characteristics of the nvss images , we used actual images from high galactic latitude fields for both the simulated `` signal '' and `` noise '' .",
    "we constructed the _ background  noise \" _",
    "image by first taking a single pair of 8.5@xmath12 8.5@xmath2 q and u images from the survey , and at all locations where @xmath13q@xmath13 and @xmath13u@xmath13 were greater than 2 mjy / beam , replaced these values with zero .",
    "this effectively eliminated almost all signals from compact sources in the q and u images .",
    "the remaining large - scale real and instrumental fluctuations in these images thus simulate the actual background against which we are trying to detect signals .",
    "the rms  noise `` distribution , which includes point source , galactic and instrumental fluctuations , is shown in figure [ noise ] , for all 4@xmath2 fields in the nvss .",
    "it can be very roughly described as a rayleigh distribution with an rms value of @xmath36.5 mjy/(800 '' beam ) , slightly larger than the expected system noise value of 5.2 mjy/(800 `` beam ) = 0.29 mjy/(45 '' beam ) @xmath14^{0.5})$ ] . at the full resolution of the nvss ,",
    "the systematic real and instrumental effects contribute little power to the q and u maps .",
    "the systematic contributions become much more important as the images are convolved to lower resolution .    to create our simulated _",
    "_ s__ignal , we took a separate nvss 1@xmath2 field and convolved the q and u images with an 8 gaussian , multiplied these images by a constant and added them respectively to the background noise q and u images .",
    "the simulated signal thus consists of a 1@xmath2 patch with structures in q and u on the scale of 8 , added to the 8.5@xmath2 background ( noise ) field at the full nvss resolution of 45 \" .",
    "we then pre - convolved these images to various scales , converted to p ( first option in figure [ snoptions ] ) and measured the means in the central 1@xmath2 region ( @xmath15 , including the local noise ) and outside the central 1@xmath2 ( p@xmath16 ) .",
    "we also measured the rms fluctuations , @xmath17 in the noise regions .",
    "finally , we calculate @xmath18/ p_{rms } .\\ ] ] the resulting signal : noise as a function of pre - convolution size is shown in figure [ noise ] .",
    "the detectability rises dramatically with convolution , as expected , since the `` signal '' was forced to have a scale of 8. at larger pre - convolution values , the signal : noise falls as the signal itself starts to be vector - averaged away and diluted .",
    "we also show the behavior of the signal : noise using _ post - convolution_. for these experiments , we added the  signal \" image ( with its 8 scale ) to the full resolution q and u  noise \" images , formed p , and then post - convolved the result to various scales ( second option in figure [ snoptions ] ) .",
    "looking again at the signal : noise for various convolutions , we see that the detectability of the signal is less than in the vector - averaged ( pre - convolution ) case because the signals are not being averaged coherently . at the larger convolution sizes , the signal :",
    "noise drops even further , mostly due to the increased noise power on large scales in the nvss , from both galactic polarization structure and residual instrumental polarization .",
    "we note that the above signal detectability experiment is a single case using an arbitrarily constructed source .",
    "the detectability of sources with specific polarization structures would have to be investigated on an individual basis .",
    "it is also possible adopt a hybrid approach and pre - convolve an image to some scale ( @xmath19 ) , and then post - convolve it to larger scales ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the advantage to this approach is that if an astronomical source has structure in q and u on scales @xmath21 , then the signal : noise will be enhanced by using @xmath22 .",
    "this pre - convolution has a second advantage for our survey  it enhances our search for new larger - scale features by enhancing them relative to smaller sources that are more likely to be already known .",
    "we therefore adopt , for this initial presentation @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and call the polarized intensity @xmath11  .",
    "it is important to note that while our @xmath11  maps with @xmath24 have a resolution very similar to those of single - dish surveys , sources with @xmath25 will be detected by us , but _ not _ with the single dish .",
    "the results presented here are almost entirely qualitative , for a number of reasons .",
    "first , they measure only the polarized `` power''in q and u from the poorly sampled low spatial frequencies in the survey up to the pre - convolution scale size .",
    "thus , a source one degree across with uniform q , u would be invisible , while another source with variations on , e.g. , 4 arcminute scales would appear strongly , even if they had the same mean @xmath26 .",
    "the spatially dependent power in q and u may also depend on the foreground rotation measure , independent of the intrinsic strength of the source .",
    "quantitative information could be derived only by constructing a detailed polarization model of a source and its foreground rotation measure structure , and then propogating that model through simulated observations and processing .",
    "we do not attempt this here .",
    "we begin with a discussion of two large fields in the galactic plane , to illustrate the differences between structures seen in total intensity and/or single - dish polarization maps .",
    "we also look at several new diffuse polarized structures , galactic and extragalactic , found through our new processing .",
    "a paper identifying a large number of new and often unidentified sources is in preparation .",
    "this region is shown in figure [ plane ] and we have previously discussed some of its instrumental and other features . here , we point out the filamentary feature extending north for about 40@xmath2 from the galactic plane in the cygnus region ( l@xmath27=90@xmath2 ) with a less - well defined counterpart to the south .",
    "the filament is also present in the total intensity bonn image at 36 resolution @xcite , especially when filtered to remove the smooth background ( using the multi - resolution filtering technique of @xcite with a box size of 7@xmath2 in longitude by 1@xmath2 in latitude ) .",
    "this feature is usually identified as the western portion of _ loop iii _ @xcite , but another possibility is suggested in figure [ newloop ] .",
    "the 36 resolution stokes q image from @xcite is shown here , with the suggestion of a new loop that extends from the cygnus region , curves up and over the galactic pole , and returns back towards the galactic plane approximately 180@xmath2 away . with a nominal center at l@xmath27=0@xmath2 , b@xmath27=20@xmath2 , and a radius of 75@xmath2 ( m. wolleben , private communication ) , it is approximately concentric with loop i , which @xcite has recently modeled in terms of two @xmath3100  pc radius synchrotron emitting shells in which we are embedded .",
    "this new suggested loop needs further study through other ism tracers , and could potentially revise our understanding of our local environment .",
    "a 50@xmath2 field near the galactic center ( figure [ nvssdrao ] ) further illustrates the similarities and differences between single dish polarization measurements and the nvss polarization reprocessing at the same wavelength and angular resolution .",
    "we pre - convolved the nvss q ,",
    "u images with 240 \" and post - convolved the p images with 36. in the nvss image , the vertical bands are artifacts from small differences in the residual instrumental polarization at different times , as observations were made along lines of constant right ascension .",
    "this is also likely responsible for some of the fine - scale mottling apparent along the vertical bands , but it is not possible for us to separate these from fine scale polarization structures .",
    "we believe that the rest of the structures visible in this nvss image are `` real '' in the sense that they reflect the actual signals from the sky .",
    "their interpretation , however , is quite different from those of single dish images , as described below .",
    "as is well known , polarization and total intensity structures are very different , even when they are both from single - dish measurements .",
    "the image from the drao polarization survey @xcite shows a bright patch in the upper right , with a smoothly varying position angle ( not shown ) over scales of degrees .",
    "the nvss is not sensitive to q and u variations on such large angular scales , and the feature is not visible in our images .",
    "high rotation measures ( @xmath7340  rad / m@xmath6 ) would also cause a degradation of the nvss signal compared to the drao image . along the galactic plane , running from upper left to lower right , the drao image shows an unresolved narrow bright band bordered by two dark stripes .",
    "the dark stripes are beam - depolarized due to a rapid switch in polarization angle across these lines . in the nvss data , these same patterns in the sky",
    "create a different response ; a broken thin strip of polarized emission along the plane is seen from the regions where the angle is changing rapidly , creating a detectable interferometer signal in q and u. however , farther from the plane , the relatively constant polarization angles from the drao position angle image ( not shown here ) lead to a broad dark region in the nvss image .",
    "the numerous depolarization filaments seen elsewhere in the drao image are again not seen in the nvss ; rapid changes in polarization angle provide an nvss signal at high resolution , and there is no depolarization introduced by the post - convolution .",
    "an alternative probe of depolarizing regions is presented by @xcite , who study the polarization of compact sources in the nvss .",
    "they find regions @xmath310@xmath2 across that cause a reduction in the number of polarized nvss sources , due to both intervening h  ii regions and diffuse galactic structures .    in figure [ nvssdrao ]",
    ", we also point out the bright emission from 3c353 in the nvss image .",
    "this radio galaxy has very strong polarized ( q and u ) emission when convolved to the 240 \" scale , which is then carried forward through the post - convolution to 36. however , the averaging of q and u themselves over 36 in the drao image makes 3c353 undetectable against the galactic background .",
    "the very luminous hii region m17 is bright in both the drao and nvss images .",
    "the nvss apparent extended polarized flux comes from strong sidelobes , as can be seen in the full resolution images ; it is likely that the drao polarization is also due to instrumental polarization .",
    "w44 is detected strongly in drao and weakly in nvss .",
    "the full resolution nvss polarization image ( not shown here ) shows a structure which is largely unrelated to the total intensity structure of w44 , so the physical origin of the polarization seen at 36 resolution is unclear .",
    "away from the galactic plane , we get a better view of more compact polarization features in the nvss , as seen in figure [ rgb ] .",
    "this is an @xmath3  44@xmath12 17@xmath2 strip of the sky centered around ra , dec 11.8h , 34.2@xmath2 , with @xmath11  in red .",
    "the green image shows the rosat all - sky survey @xcite convolved to 800 `` .",
    "the blue image is the total intensity nvss image , also convolved to 800 '' .",
    "note that at this high galactic latitude ( @xmath28 ) , and with the additional filtering , very little galactic structure is visible in @xmath11  . a large number of bright compact features are visible , appearing in red ( blue ) for high ( low ) fractional polarization .",
    "most of these are also seen in the full resolution nvss images .",
    "a number of more extended polarization features are also visible in figure [ rgb ] , many of which are well - known sources . in the southeast ,",
    "the bright green structure is the x - ray emission from the coma cluster of galaxies , with an extension to the southwest from an infalling subcluster @xcite . at the southwest x - ray terminus",
    "is a transverse polarized radio structure with brightness @xmath320  mjy/800 \" beam ( 20 mk ) above the background .",
    "this is the well - studied  relic \" first detected by @xcite , and then studied in total intensity and polarization , e.g. , by @xcite .",
    "note the absence of blue , total intensity , emission from this polarized structure ; with an angular extent of @xmath31@xmath2 , the total intensity is not detected in the nvss survey .",
    "similarly , the diffuse polarized emission from the giant radio galaxies 3c236 and b2  1321 + 31 is easily visible , while only their more compact features are seen in total intensity in the nvss .    among the bright extended polarization structures are several that were previously unknown .",
    "feature a is one of the brightest structures in the high latitude sky ( 25 - 35 mk ) ; follow - up observations with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope @xcite suggest that it is a galactic faraday system .",
    "such structures have no intrinsic synchrotron emissivity , but appear bright to the interferometer because they produce small - scale variations in q and u from the galactic background @xcite .",
    "feature b , and others like it in the image , are examples of single nvss pointings with high residual instrumental polarization ; they are recognizable by their circular shape and sizes comparable to the primary beam ( @xmath330 ) .",
    "we have not yet found a reliable way to eliminate instrumental problems at the lowest levels seen in figure [ rgb ] , especially when they span several pointings . in the following ,",
    "we therefore present examples of new extended polarization features only with high signal : noise , to illustrate the potential power of this nvss reprocessing technique .      a network of tailed radio sources is seen in this cluster @xcite , which might be responsible for the bright polarized emission centered on the cluster seen in figure [ a3744 ] . at a redshift of 0.0381 ,",
    "abell 3744 is listed as a member of supercluster number 180 by @xcite , who group it with abell 3733 , ( z=0.0382 ) , and , apparently mistakenly , with the background cluster abell 3706 at a redshift of @xmath30.1 .",

    ", a polarized structure is seen 37 ( 1.8  mpc ) from the cluster center , with an extent of @xmath31.4  mpc . a slice at constant declination through the peak of polarized emission and through the eastern structure is also shown in figure [ a3744 ] , to demonstrate the signal : noise of these features .",
    "the eastern structure has a peak polarized flux 40 mjy / beam above the background , with a background rms of 6 mjy / beam .",
    "it has a total polarized flux ( @xmath11  ) of @xmath390 mjy , and no obvious total intensity counterpart .",
    "it is important to note that our polarized fluxes are the result of our non - standard processing procedure , and that the true signals measured with an interferometer plus single - dish system could be considerably higher , assuming no additional contributions from a nearby faraday screen . assuming our nominal fluxes and a 33% fractional polarization would yield a monochromatic radio luminosity of 10@xmath31 w / hz at 1.4 ghz .",
    "if this is a peripheral relic , or gischt @xcite , both its radio and associated x - ray cluster luminosities are significantly lower than those of most relic systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "only one other cluster , abell 548b , which is part of a very complex optical and x - ray system @xcite , has similarly low luminosities . the abell 3744 relic would also be considerably further from the cluster core than is typically seen . confirming and",
    "more detailed polarization observations of this system would also be most useful .",
    "3c31 is a very well - studied wide - angle tailed radio galaxy @xcite with a total extent of @xmath740 ( @xmath3850 kpc at z=0.0169 with h@xmath32= 70 km / s / mpc , * ? ? ?",
    "in our polarization image , figure [ 3c31 ] , we find emission extending @xmath31.2@xmath2 to the southwest , where it partially merges with polarized emission from an unrelated background source . to the southeast , there is polarized emission bridging to 3c34 , an unrelated source in a z=0.69 cluster @xcite .",

    "we therefore conclude that poorly sampled sidelobes from the polarized emission in 3c31 is not responsible for the newly detected features .",

    "note that in their figure 1 , 3c31 is the northern component of the apparent double structure ; the southern component is 3c34 .",
    "assuming that the southwest extension is associated with 3c31 , it would have an extent of @xmath31.5  mpc .",
    "there is some possibility that the observed polarization structure results from distant sidelobes of 3c31 , although processing the total intensity nvss images in the same way as q and u ( i.e. , forcing them to be positive and then post - convolving ) , did not show significant sidelobe contributions .",
    "assuming the polarization structure is real , the @xmath3611.1  cm results cited above also suggest that there has been an outflow to the southwest from 3c  31 . lacking bright jet features",
    ", this structure would likely be a remnant of past activity , perhaps now being energized by large scale group processes .",
    "indications of the dynamical state of the group include the offset of ngc  383 from the centroid of the x - ray emission and significant x - ray structure towards the southwest @xcite , which is detected out to the virial radius at @xmath3700 kpc .",
    "this well - known supernova remnant has a filled x - ray structure and a radio shell which is not visible in the nvss total intensity images .",
    "it has been mapped at 1 in polarization at 1.4 ghz using the drao telescope @xcite .",
    "all of the major features seen in the drao image are reproduced in our nvss reconstruction at 800 `` resolution ( figure [ cta1 ] ) .",
    "in addition , we find one diffuse bright patch at 00h10 m , 72@xmath2 that is not seen in the drao map . the diffuse nature of this patch is established by the lack of smaller - scaled polarized features in the full resolution q , u images ( at a level of q , u @xmath38 3  mjy/45 '' beam ) .",
    "its peak brightness is 30 mjy/800 ",
    "beam above the local mean , with a background rms of @xmath35 mjy/800  beam .",
    "if it were completely smooth , the polarized brightness would be only 0.2  mjy/1 beam , compared to the drao rms value of 0.3  mjy/1 beam , so it is reasonable that it had not been previously detected .",
    "the bright patch is on the border of what @xcite call the `` reverse shell '' region , where the curvature of the radio structure is inverted .",
    "their explanation for the shape of this region is that the shock has encountered and encircled a dense cloud .",
    "the new polarized patch may help define the borders of this cloud encounter , but the lack of bright , narrow polarized or total intensity emission , as pointed out by @xcite , is still a problem for this explanation .",
    "polarized intensity is not a well - defined quantity when there is more than one polarized component along the same line of sight , creating both challenges and opportunities .",
    "although there are heroic attempts to separate multiple components if they are separated in rotation measure space @xcite , in general , observed polarized intensities depend on a complicated combination of observing frequency , resolution , and the spatial frequencies represented in the image .",
    "this complication also allows a variety of processing schemes to be carried out on stokes parameter images , which can result in new structures being identified .",
    "our reprocessing of the nvss survey in stokes q and u explores a region of observing frequency / resolution / spatial frequency that has not been previously studied .",
    "we therefore have been able to identify many new features , as well as recover structures that are invisible in the total intensity nvss but seen at other telescopes .",
    "one common feature of the extended emission features we detect is that they are of low surface brightness .",
    "images free of galactic emission have rms fluctuations @xmath32",
    "mjy/800 `` beam ( 2   mk ) .",
    "a 5@xmath39 detection would therefore correspond to @xmath310  mjy/800 '' beam or @xmath330  mjy/800 \" beam in total intensity , assuming a fractional polarization of @xmath40 .",
    "by contrast , a single dish working at the same frequency and angular resolution , would have a 5@xmath39 confusion limit of @xmath3125  mjy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . under favorable conditions of high fractional polarization and q , u variations on scales",
    "@xmath3815 , the reprocessed nvss can then be much more sensitive to diffuse structures than any single - dish survey .",
    "all - sky surveys of diffuse polarization could thus be a powerful way to probe low density extragalactic regions .",
    "assuming an optimum sensitivity of 30mjy/800 \" beam ( total intensity ) , the equivalent minimum energy magnetic field for a detected synchrotron structure will have values @xmath30.2@xmath9 g .",
    "this corresponds to pressures of @xmath310@xmath41 , in the regime of the whim @xcite .",
    "radio observations at these low brightness levels could then serve to illuminate the diffuse baryon component of large scale structure , where 30 - 50% of the baryons are likely located , but are exceedingly difficult to detect through their thermal emission .",
    "simulations by @xcite and @xcite , e. g. , show that such radio emission is expected , driven by the magnetic field amplification and relativistic particle acceleration at shocks on the borders and in the interior of filaments .",
    "much more sensitive polarization measurements , with significantly reduced instrumental problems , will soon be available on the evla , and a new generation of wide - field , low frequency instruments such as lofar and the mwa will allow us to probe much deeper into the whim regime over large areas of the sky .",
    "combinations of single dish and interferometer observations may also allow such features to be seen in total intensity for individual regions where the large investment of observation and analysis time can be justified .",
    "it is unlikely that features found through our nvss reprocessing will affect upcoming cmb polarization experiments .",
    "we have identified new features on scales down to @xmath19 = 240 \" . for the new synchrotron sources ,",
    "forthcoming cmb polarization experiments that work at these resolutions or smaller , such as planck or ebex @xcite , will have sufficient frequency coverage to model the foreground contamination from galactic or extra - galactic synchrotron sources internally .",
    "we also detect  pseudo - sources \" due to faraday screens in our galaxy .",
    "however , direct faraday rotation of the cmb signal from these regions is negligible at @xmath42ghz ( @xmath43 for a rotation measure of rm=1000 rad / m@xmath44 ) . at the same time",
    ", the faraday screen features could indicate the presence of undetected hii regions @xcite .",
    "the bremsstrahlung emission from hii regions can be polarized at the 10@xmath45 level due to thomson scattering at the edges of the clouds @xcite , but the polarized brightness should be at least an order of magnitude less than that of synchrotron emission at frequencies above 10 ghz @xcite .",
    "such signals are typically not modeled as a polarized foreground component in the wmap analysis @xcite .",
    "a reprocessing of the nvss polarization images has allowed the recovery of diffuse structures on large angular scales .",
    "the details of the processing allow one to tailor the sensitivity to particular angular scales of interest . at present , residual instrumental polarization variations across the sky",
    "are a key limiting factor .",
    "a variety of new galactic and extragalactic sources have already been identified , with a more comprehensive census underway . while a better recovery of diffuse polarization structures is possible , e.g. , by combining single dish and interferometer measurements , the next generation of radio telescopes such as lofar , the mwa and evla will also be able to exploit the processing technique introduced here to provide probes , e.g. , of the relativistic plasmas associated with the elusive whim .",
