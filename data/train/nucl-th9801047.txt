    "quasielastic electron scattering on nuclei has been in the past years the subject of intense experimental @xcite and theoretical ( see , e.  g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) investigations .",
    "the first aim of the theoretical studies is to test the available nuclear models ; once the nuclear physics issues are well understood , one might hope to gain insight into other aspects of the problem , for instance by extracting with sufficient precision the nucleon form factors .    in principle , the quasifree regime makes one confident that the physical quantities of interest may be computed in a reliable way ; in practice , also in this case one has to cope with considerable computational problems .",
    "many diverse techniques have been employed in the literature .",
    "each of them has its own relative merits and deficiencies and , in general , it would be highly desirable to be able to reach some degree of convergence in their outcomes .    in the following",
    ", we shall be concerned with green s function techniques , as introduced , e.  g. , in ref .",
    "these methods can be , and have been , applied both to finite nuclei and nuclear matter , the choice being generally driven by the specific reaction and by the momentum regime of interest . here",
    ", we shall focus on the nuclear matter , having in mind applications to electron scattering ( that is , without the complications introduced by the reaction mechanism of hadronic probes ) in a range from a few hundreds to several hundreds mev / c of transferred momenta ( where the quasielastic peak is sufficiently far from low - energy resonances and not too much affected by finite size effects ) .",
    "the use of nuclear matter reduces the computational load , thus allowing a more straightforward implementation of more sophisticated theoretical schemes : this makes easier to develop and test approximation methods that could then be utilized also for calculations in finite nuclei .",
    "let us now briefly browse the theoretical framework that we shall discuss in detail in the following sections .",
    "a first choice one has to do in setting up the formalism concerns the treatment of relativistic effects .",
    "trivial kinematical effects can be obviously rather important and can be included in a straightforward way .",
    "the treatment of dynamical effects is more delicate .",
    "two main paths have been followed in the literature : either using field theoretical methods ( as done , e.  g. , in the walecka model and its derivations @xcite ) or potential techniques ( using , i.  e. , phenomenological potentials truncated at some order in the non - relativistic expansion ) . here",
    ", we shall put ourselves on the second path , but , to contain the amount of material , we shall employ strictly non - relativistic potentials .",
    "the extensions necessary to include higher order relativistic terms will be discussed elsewhere ( see , however , refs .",
    "@xcite for a few applications ) .",
    "next , one should choose the phenomenological input potential and , in connection with this choice , possibly the way of dealing with short - range correlations .",
    "all the formulae we are going to give in the following sections are based on a generic one - boson - exchange potential .",
    "they can thus be used both with a bare phenomenological interaction ,  such as one of the bonn potential variants ,  or with a one - boson - exchange parameterization of a @xmath0-matrix generated from some potential .",
    "the use of an effective interaction derived from a @xmath0-matrix is a common way of including short - range correlations .",
    "one should be aware of possible problems due to the use of a local potential to fit non - local matrix elements .",
    "at least in a few cases discussed in the literature this does not appear to be a reason of concern @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , possible effects due to the specific quasielastic regime remain completely unexplored : indeed , @xmath0-matrices employed in quasielastic calculations are usually generated using bound state boundary conditions , which make them real and practically energy independent , while , in general , they might be complex and energy dependent .",
    "once we have fixed the effective interaction , we can proceed to consider a hierarchy of approximation schemes .",
    "the lowest order approximation is , of course , given by the free fermi gas .",
    "then , one may include mean field correlations at the hartree - fock ( hf ) level ( or brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) if short - range correlations are accounted for ) . in nuclear matter",
    "a hf calculation can be done exactly without too many efforts .",
    "nevertheless , we show how a quite accurate analytic approximation can be derived , since we shall need the method later to combine the hf and the random phase approximation ( rpa ) schemes .",
    "the latter is the last resummation technique to be discussed .",
    "it should be noticed that even in nuclear matter the calculation of the _ antisymmetrized _ rpa response functions is not trivial .",
    "indeed , most calculations that are labeled `` rpa '' in the literature are actually performed in the so - called `` ring approximation '' , where only the direct contributions are kept : in this case , in nuclear matter one gets an algebraic equation . here , we use the continued fraction ( cf ) technique to provide a semi - analytical estimate of the full rpa response ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for alternative methods ) .",
    "calculations with this method have been performed both in finite nuclei @xcite and in nuclear matter @xcite , always truncating the cf expansion at first order , because of the difficulty of the numerical calculations .",
    "we have pushed the analytical calculation far enough to allow not only a fast and accurate estimate of the first order cf expansion , but also of the second order one . since in the cf technique",
    "there is no general way of estimating the convergence of the series , this is the only way of getting a quantitative hold on the quality of the approximation .",
    "as noticed before , hf ( and kinematical relativistic ) effects can then be incorporated in the rpa calculation , yielding as the final approximation scheme a hf - rpa ( or bhf - rpa ) response function .    of course , many diverse many - body contributions have been left out .",
    "it should however be noted that the classes of many - body diagrams discussed here , on the one hand already allow one to study many interesting features of the quasielastic response ; on the other hand , the fact of having developed semi - analytical methods reduces to a minimum the computational efforts , thus making this formalism a good starting point for the study of other many - body effects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the theoretical machinery",
    "is set up , discussing in separate subsections the treatment of relativistic kinematics and the free , hf and rpa responses .",
    "the intent of this paper is just to provide theoretical tools , so we do not attempt any discussion of the phenomenology of quasielastic scattering . on the other hand , in section",
    "3 calculations based on the formalism previously developed are shown , in order to test the convergence of the cf expansion and the importance of antisymmetrization . finally , in the last section we present a few concluding remarks .",
    "let us consider an infinite system of ( possibly ) interacting nucleons , at some density corresponding to a fermi momentum @xmath1 .",
    "for the kinetic energies of the nucleons we can choose either the relativistic or non - relativistic expressions , whereas we assume that the interactions take place through a non - relativistic potential . for the latter",

    "it is then customary to define longitudinal and transverse response functions @xmath36 which are related to @xmath37 by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the volume , @xmath40 the mass number and @xmath41 contain the squared electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon .",
    "the response functions introduced above have been defined as functions of the momentum transfer @xmath32 and of the energy transfer @xmath33 .",
    "actually , it is possible ,  and convenient ,  to define a scaling variable @xmath42 , which combines @xmath32 and @xmath33 : this variable is such that the free responses in the non - pauli - blocked region ( @xmath43 ) can be expressed in terms of the unique variable @xmath42 ( apart from @xmath32-dependent multiplicative factors ) .",
    "we shall see that even in the pauli - blocked region and for an interacting system it is convenient to use the pair of variables ( @xmath32,@xmath42 ) instead of ( @xmath32,@xmath33 ) .",
    "besides the obvious advantages related to the use of a scaling variable , there is another good reason for expressing the responses in terms of @xmath42 : in fact , in this way one can define response functions that are independent of the form chosen for the nucleon kinetic energy .",
    "to be more specific : starting from either a non - relativistic or a relativistic fermi gas , one is always lead to the same expressions for the responses in terms of ( @xmath32,@xmath42 ) ; to be different in the two cases is , of course , the definition of @xmath42 in terms of ( @xmath32,@xmath33 ) .",
    "we shall see in the following subsections that the energy denominators of the free nucleon propagators , appearing in the feynman diagrams for the response functions , can always be written as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the kinetic energy of a nucleon of momentum @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",

    "[ fig : r1vs2sigma ] one can understand that the validity of the cf expansion originates out of the interplay between range and strength of the interaction : for short - range potentials ,  where the conventional perturbative expansion may not converge ,  the cf technique gives a good approximation of the propagators at all orders ; for long - range ( on the nuclear scale ) forces , the cf approximation is less accurate , but the relative weakness of the interaction already guarantees the convergence of the conventional perturbative expansion .",

    "accurate approximations for the inclusion of the relativistic kinematics and of hf effects have also been discussed and tested .",
