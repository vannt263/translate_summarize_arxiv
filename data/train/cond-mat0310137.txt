    "it is well known that all wave functions of translationary symmetric systems are delocalized .",
    "one of the most interesting properties of the homogeneous disordered systems is the possibility of localised wave functions .",
    "the mathematical problems of the theory of disordered systems are very complicated and for this reason the theory of disordered systems is not so well developed as the theory of symmetric systems . despite this fact some statements related to disordered systems are considered to be well established and reliable .",
    "the above mentioned occurrence of the localised band is one of them .",
    "the next example of statement of this kind is that all states in 1d disordered system are localised @xcite",
    ". recently appeared the reports @xcite about the delocalisation in 1d systems with intersite interaction in the form : @xmath0 . in this letter",
    "we consider 1d diagonally disordered chain with exponential intersite interaction and present arguments ( computer simulations and theoretical treatment ) in favor of partial delocalisation in this system . in this section",
    "we describe the system and present numerical results and in the next section we review the reasons which made us to study this system and present the approximate expression for the mobility edge .",
    "let us consider 1d frenkel exciton in diagonally disordered chain .",
    "the mathematical problem is redused to the following random matrix of the hamiltonian : @xmath1    where    @xmath2    random values @xmath3 are supposed to be independent and having the distribution function : @xmath4\\cr 0 \\hskip3 mm \\hbox{other cases } } \\hskip5mm\\hbox{(anderson 's model)}\\ ] ]    the thermodynamic limit @xmath5 is implied . to separate the localised and delocalised wave functions one should use some criterion of localisation .",
    "we use _ the number of sites covered by the wave function _",
    "@xcite determined as follows .",
    "let us consider some eigen vector @xmath6 of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) with components @xmath7 .",
    "what contribution one should ascribe to the arbitrary site @xmath8 ? it is naturally to accept that this contribution is zero if @xmath9 and equal to unit if @xmath10max@xmath11 .",
    "so we come to the conclusion that the contribution of the arbitrary site @xmath8 is @xmath12 .",
    "the total number of sites @xmath13 covered by normalised eigen function @xmath6 is the sum of contributions of all sites :    @xmath14    delocalisation in ( 1),(2),(3 ) appear when @xmath15 .",
    "below we study the properties of the eigen vectors of ( 1 ) with @xmath16 .",
    "the dependance of number of sites covered by the wave function against corresponding energy for the hamiltonian ( 1 ) is presented on fig.1 ( top ) .",
    "it is seen that @xmath17 is drastically increasing for energies higher than @xmath18 .",
    "additional calculations shows that @xmath17 do not depend on the number of sites @xmath19 for @xmath20 and is @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "for all these reasons we conclude that states below @xmath23 are localised and states above @xmath23 are delocalised .",
    "on our opinion the main properties of the above model which are responsible for the delocalisation are long range of intersite interaction @xmath24 and the fact that function @xmath25 differs from zero only in the finite region . for these reasons for the qualitative interpretation",
    "we apply the following exactly solvable simple model of disordered system .",
    "let the radius of interaction be infinite and write down the simplified hamiltonian in the form :      taking advantage of the coherent potential approximation @xcite one can show that the density of states for hamiltonians ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) is coincide in the limit @xmath27 .",
    "we show below that the hamiltonian ( 5 ) has one delocalised and @xmath28 localised eigen functions .",
    "consequently at least one delocalised function should appear in the set of eigen functions of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) in the limit @xmath29 .",
    "the desire to see how this take place was the starting point for our study of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) with @xmath15 .",
    "now let us turn to the proof of the above properties of the hamiltonian ( 5 ) .",
    "\\(6 ) gives an explicit expression for the eigen vectors of ( 5 ) as a functions of @xmath8 and eigen number @xmath31 . by substituting @xmath33 in the formula for @xmath34 one",
    "can obtain the equation for the eigen values",
    "@xmath31 :      for anderson s model ( 3 ) all quantities @xmath3 are differs from each other . for the graphical treatment of ( 7 ) the qualitative form of @xmath36 function",
    "is presented on fig.2 . from fig.2",
    "one can see that @xmath28 eigen values are belong to @xmath37 $ ] and the last eigen value @xmath38 is not belong to this interval and in the thermodynamic limit can be determined from the equation : @xmath39        so in the thermodynamic limit @xmath38 is separated from any of @xmath3 by finite interval . from ( 6 ) one can see that sharp extremums of the wave function related to the localisation can appear if @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "@xmath38 do not belong to this interval and we come to the conclusion that the corresponding eigen vector in the case of homogineous disorder is _",
    "delocalised_. now let us show that all others eigen vectors are localised . for this reason introduce the green s function in t - representation @xmath42 which describe the dynamics of the wave function on the site @xmath8 if it was equal to 1 on this site at @xmath43 .",
    "if the finite part of eigen states of the hamiltonian @xmath44 is delocalised this function goes down to zero when @xmath45 and @xmath5 .",
    "if green s function do not decrease it means that the main part of eigen vectors is localised and the part of delocalised states is extremely small @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the green s function in e - representation : @xmath46                in the thermodynamic limit the term @xmath53 should be omitted and we come to the conclusion that the green s function have a single pole @xmath54 .",
    "this corresponds to the oscillations of the wave function with constant amplitude and we can conclude that the main part of states are localised .",
    "it is easy to see that above described oscillations corresponds to the wave function localised on the site @xmath8 and having an eigen value @xmath55 . from fig.2",
    "one can see that there are @xmath28 eigen values of this kind and we come to the conclusion that the hamiltonian ( 5 ) have @xmath28 localised states and one delocalised with eigen number @xmath38 ( 9 ) .",
    "note that the appearance of the separated delocalised state for ( 5 ) is possible only if the distribution function @xmath25 is differ from zero in finite interval .",
    "for this reason we expect that delocalisation in ( 1 ) is also possible if @xmath25 is differ from zero in finite interval or at least goes down to zero rapidly enough .",
    "this statement confirms by calculations for lloyd s model with @xmath56 when no delocalisation was found .",
    "the energy dependance of number of covered sites for hamiltonian ( 5 ) is presented on fig.1 ( bottom ) for @xmath57 .",
    "other parameters are the same as for the top picture .",
    "one can see that finiteness of the interaction radius results in appearance of delocalised states in the gap @xmath58 $ ] but the boundary energy of spectrum and the mobility edge are the same for both hamiltonians ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) and are equal @xmath38 ( 9 ) and @xmath59 respectively .",
