    "the interaction between electrons and the electromagnetic fields of a laser wave mainly relies on the electron charge .",
    "in addition , the electronic spin degree of freedom can couple to the laser field via the electron s magnetic moment .",
    "accordingly , when a free electron is exposed to a plane - wave laser pulse , the electronic spin vector performs a precessive motion .",
    "however , after the laser pulse has passed , the electron will end up in the same spin state as it was before the interaction started @xcite .",
    "nontransient electron spin transitions can occur only if the electron undergoes a scattering process inside the laser field .",
    "then , the electronic spin state before and after the interaction with the field may differ .",
    "corresponding spin transitions have been studied theoretically , e.g. , in multiphoton compton scattering @xcite , strong - field photoionization @xcite and laser - assisted mott scattering @xcite .",
    "typically , spin effects can become sizeable at very high field frequencies or very high field strengths .",
    "spin effects may also arise in kapitza - dirac scattering .",
    "the kapitza - dirac effect as originally proposed , denotes the quantum mechanical diffraction of an electron beam on the periodic potential generated by a standing wave of light @xcite .",
    "the latter can be formed by two counterpropagating laser beams . in its original version @xcite the effect",
    "can be understood as a combined absorption and emission process involving two photons : the incident electron absorbs one photon of momentum @xmath0 from one of the laser beams , and emits another photon of momentum @xmath1 into the counterpropagating beam ( stimulated compton scattering ) , resulting in a momentum transfer of @xmath2 .",
    "an experimental realization of kapitza - dirac diffraction in its original form was accomplished some years ago , utilizing optical laser intensities of the order of @xmath3@xmath4w/@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "related experiments observed the kapitza - dirac effect on atoms @xcite .",
    "distinct spin effects in kapitza - dirac scattering were predicted when a moderately relativistic electron beam impinges under the ( generalized ) bragg angle on a standing x - ray laser wave @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the original work @xcite , this spin - dependent kapitza - dirac effect relies on a 3-photon process , where two photons are absorbed and one photon is emitted ( or vice versa ) . the interaction may be considered as arising from an @xmath6 term in the hamiltonian , in combination with a @xmath7 term .",
    "hence , the coupling involves both the electric charge and the magnetic moment of the electron .",
    "while the theory in @xcite was based on the dirac equation , a relativistic treatment of the kapitza - dirac effect based on the klein - gordon equation may be found in @xcite .",
    "electron - laser interaction dynamics can be enriched further in bichromatic fields containing two different frequency components @xcite .",
    "in particular , characteristic quantum interferences may arise when the frequencies are commensurate .",
    "two - color effects have been studied for a variety of processes , comprising strong - field photoionization @xcite , laser - assisted electron - atom scattering @xcite , and x - ray thomson scattering @xcite . quantum interference and relative phase effects",
    "have recently also been revealed for kapitza - dirac scattering in bichromatic and multichromatic standing laser waves @xcite .",
    "bichromatic laser fields may be exploited to facilitate spin effects in kapitza - dirac scattering .",
    "recently it has been demonstrated @xcite that spin flips in 3-photon processes similar to @xcite can arise in the nonrelativistic regime of low electron energies and field frequencies when the electron scatters from two counterpropagating laser beams which possess a frequency ratio of two ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the spin effects are most pronounced when the incident electron momentum is perpendicular to the linear field polarization .",
    "otherwise , 3-photon scattering involving the @xmath8 interaction term would generally dominate @xcite .",
    "the occurence of coherent electron scattering in this field configuration may be understood by noting that the system can be lorentz transformed into a frame of reference where the counterpropagating waves possess equal frequencies and form a standing wave .",
    "we point out that spin effects in the original ( 2-photon ) kapitza - dirac effect were found to be very small @xcite , but can become distinct when elliptically polarized fields are applied @xcite . in this case , however , the spin - flip transitions compete with spin - preserving electron scattering and are suppressed by a relative factor of @xmath9 .    in this paper",
    ", we study spin - dependent kapitza - dirac scattering of nonrelativistic electrons from counterpropagating bichromatic laser fields of linear polarization .",
    "the electron spin dynamics is revealed by numerically solving the pauli equation , both in coordinate space and in momentum space .",

    "we show that the electron spin undergoes characteristic rabi - like oscillations and derive an analytical formula for the corresponding rabi frequency within the framework of time - dependent perturbation theory .",

    "however , due to the spin interaction term , there exists one important difference between eqs .   and .",
    "the former still contains the proton @xmath10-factor @xmath161 , which differs from the electron @xmath10-factor @xmath162 by almost a factor of three in magnitude . as a consequence , in spin - sensitive interaction processes , electron and proton dynamics are not fully equivalent . for the particular case of spin - dependent kapitza - dirac scattering involving three - photons ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : theory ] ) , the proton interacts more strongly with the  correspondingly scaled  electromagnetic fields than the electron . the enhanced interaction strength can be quantified by the rabi frequency which amounts to @xmath163 for protons .",
    "spin - dependent kapitza - dirac scattering of electrons and protons from bichromatic laser waves was studied in the nonrelativistic regime .",
    "our consideration focused on the case of linearly polarized counterpropagating laser waves with a fundamental frequency and its second harmonic . on the one hand , we derived analytical results for the associated short - time scattering probability in this field configuration .",
    "it was shown that the deflection of electrons with specific incident momenta is necessarily accompanied by a flip of the electronic spin components orthogonal to the magnetic field direction .",
    "this way , a pronounced entanglement between the outgoing electron momentum and spin state arises .    on the other hand ,",
    "the full time dependence of the electron dynamics was obtained by solving the time - dependent pauli equation numerically .",
    "the coherent scattering of the electrons leads to characteristic rabi cycles .",
    "we emphasize that , for equal amplitudes of the counterpropagating laser waves , the same kind of rabi oscillations were also found in @xcite in a strongly doppler - shifted reference frame . by performing a systematic parameter scan , covering a broad range from ultraviolet to x - ray laser frequencies , we found and characterized different interaction regimes in which the rabi cycles are either fully developed , only partially developed or completely suppressed .    due to numerical feasibility , we applied laser fields with rather high frequencies and intensities in our computations .",
    "radiation sources with corresponding characteristics are , in principle , available through high - harmonic emission from laser - irradiated plasma surfaces @xcite or at free - electron laser laboratories , such as the flash facility at desy ( hamburg , germany ) @xcite and the lcls at slac ( stanford , california ) @xcite . in the examples shown ,",
    "the development of a substantial fraction of a rabi cycle requires interaction times in the range of several femtoseconds up to picoseconds .    in a forthcoming study",
    "we intend to investigate spin - dependent kapitza - dirac scattering in laser waves of circular polarization , where the photons carry a definite helicity ( see also ) .",
    "inspiring discussions with m.j.a . jansen are gratefully acknowleged .",
    "we thank s. ahrens and h. bauke for carefully reading the manuscript . this study was supported by sfb tr18 of the german research foundation ( dfg ) under project no . b11 .",
    "in sec .  [ sub : rabi_dynamics ] we saw that the rabi oscillations between the incident electron state and the spin - flipped scattered state are not always fully developed .",
    "the reason was attributed to an intrinsic , field - induced detuning in the system . in this appendix , we provide a simplified model which is able to demonstrate this behavior .",
    "let us assume we can model our setup as a quantum two - state system in the orthonormal basis @xmath164 .",
    "additionally , we introduce a longitudinal momentum offset @xmath38 to both states giving a detuning in the kinetic energy of @xmath165 .",
    "the simplified hamilton operator then reads @xmath166 here @xmath167 describes an a - priori undetermined intrinsic detuning . for the time evolution operator",
    "we obtain @xmath168 with the effective rabi frequency @xmath169 the off - diagonal terms of describe the transition amplitude from one state to the other .",
    "therefore we can infer , that the occupation of the states oscillates with the effective rabi frequency @xmath170 and amplitude @xmath171 more explicitly , the transition probability is @xmath172 thus , the rabi oscillation amplitude is generally damped . in fig .",
    "[ fig : resonance_peak ] a sweep over the detuning parameter is shown for a parameter set at moderately high vector potential just below the dyke in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "it can be seen , that the numerical simulations based on eq .",
    "nicely resemble the detuning model described above , and that the intrinsic detuning @xmath167 is positive .",
    "note that very similar resonance peaks have been investigated in @xcite for monochromatic 2-photon and 3-photon kapitza - dirac scattering .     to state @xmath173 .",
    "the laser parameters read @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "the rabi amplitude @xmath105 is shown ( crosses ) with a fit of eq .",
    "over @xmath167 and @xmath176 ( dashed line ) .",
    "additionally the measured frequency @xmath170 ( pluses ) is compared to eq .",
    "( dash - dotted line ) with the same fit parameters .",
    "the latter are marked on the corresponding axes .",
    "[ fig : resonance_peak ] ]    further numerical simulations show , that @xmath167 decreases with @xmath39 , reaching the dyke summit when @xmath177 and drops quite fast beyond the dyke .",
    "this is in good agreement with the structure described in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .    still , for short times , the transition probability is independent of the detuning and given by @xmath178 .",
    "this behaviour is also well - known from rabi oscillations in two - level systems with permanent detuning ( * ? ? ?",
    "5.2.1 ) .",
    "our model hamiltonian thus catches the basic phenomenology of detuned rabi oscillation dynamics .",
    "we point out that it closely resembles the effective hamiltonian in eq .   which followed from the magnus expansion .",
    "as argued in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] , the physical origin of the field - induced detuning might be connected to the asymmetric field configuration , with co- and counterpropagating laser waves of different frequencies ( and amplitudes ) . the relevant value of the detuning @xmath167 in the numerical results of figs .",
    "[ fig : time_rabi ] and [ fig : time_rabi_reduced ] can be inferred by comparing eqs .   and , or by measuring the characteristics of the resonance peak like in fig .",
    "[ fig : resonance_peak ] .",
    "in this appendix , we present an alternative derivation of the spin - flip rabi frequency in eq .  .",
    "our approach is based on relativistic volkov states which are solutions to the dirac equation in the presence of a plane - wave laser field .",
    "usually , these states can only be applied to problems involving a single travelling laser wave .",
    "in contrast , the spin - dependent kapitza - dirac effect under consideration occurs in the combined fields of two counterpropagating waves .",
    "however , out of the three photons which are exchanged in total , only one is emitted into ( or absorbed from ) the high - frequency field mode . in the limit of moderate laser intensities , the influence of this field mode can , thus , be treated within the first order of perturbation theory .",
    "the interaction with the low - frequency field mode , in turn , may be incorporated into dressed electronic states .",
    "while this kind of approach , in principle , allows to treat the impact of the low - frequency wave nonperturbatively , we shall be interested in the perturbative limit where two low - frequency photons participate in the process . in comparison with standard perturbation theory ( of third order for both fields ) , this approach has the advantage of being rather compact",
    ".    the kapitza - dirac effect may be regarded as stimulated compton scattering .",
    "we therefore start our consideration from the usual @xmath179 matrix describing multiphoton compton scattering ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath180 here , @xmath181 with @xmath182 d\\phi\\ ] ] denotes the dirac - volkov state for the incoming electron dressed by the field @xmath183 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath184 is the dirac - volkov state for the scattered electron .",
    "we use the notation @xmath185 for the product of two four - vectors @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "feynman slash notation is employed for the four - product with dirac @xmath188-matrices .",
    "the free dirac spinors @xmath189 are taken from @xcite , with the spin quantized along the @xmath34 axis .    for definiteness",
    ", we assume that the incident electron has a longitudinal momentum component @xmath190 ( zero offset ) and a spin projection @xmath191 . in order to be scattered into the mirrored momentum state with @xmath192",
    ", the electron needs to absorb two photons from the field @xmath193 and to emit one photon into the counterpropagating field @xmath194 . besides",
    ", the electron momenta are assumed to be nonrelativistic , so that @xmath195 holds .",

    ".   runs over the number of photons exchanged with the laser field @xmath193 .",
    "the term with @xmath199 ( @xmath200 ) corresponds to the absorption of one photon ( two photons ) from the wave @xmath193 .",

    "similarly , @xmath204 is the part of @xmath205 responsible for photon emission .",
    "note that @xmath206 . in the perturbative limit of small field amplitudes ,",
    "the bessel functions may be expanded : @xmath207 , @xmath208 . moreover , if we assume that the electron momentum has no component along the field polarization ( i.e. , @xmath209 ) , eq .   further simplifies to @xmath210 by an explicit evaluation one finds , that the spinor - matrix product vanishes identically if the spin quantum numbers coincide ( @xmath211 ) .",
    "in contrast , when the electron transition involves a spin flip ( @xmath212 ) , one obtains @xmath213 .",
    "the space - time integration in eq .   produces a factor @xmath214 since we have chosen the outgoing electron momentum @xmath215 to agree with the energy - momentum conservation in the process .",
