    "a detection or nondetection of primordial non - gaussianity in the cmb data is crucial not only to discriminate inflationary models but also to test some alternative scenarios for the physics of the early universe .",
    "however , the extraction of primordial non - gaussianity is a difficult enterprise since several effects of non - primordial nature can produce non - gaussianity in the cmb data . clearly",
    "the study of detectable non - gaussianities in the wmap data must take into account that they may have non - cosmological origins as , for example , unsubtracted foreground contamination , unconsidered point sources emission and systematic errors.@xcite deviation from gaussianity may also have a cosmic topology origin ( see , e.g. , the review articles refs .   and related refs .  ) .",
    "if , on the one hand , different statistical tools can in principle provide information about distinct forms of non - gaussianity , on the other hand one does not expect that a single statistical estimator can be sensitive to all possible forms of non - gaussianity in cmb data .",
    "it is therefore important to test cmb data for gaussianity by using different statistical indicators to shed some light on its possible causes . in view of this , a great deal of effort has recently gone into verifying the existence of non - gaussianity by employing several statistical estimators.@xcite    recently have we proposed@xcite two new large - angle non - gaussianity indicators , based on skewness and kurtosis of large - angle patches of cmb maps , which provide measures of the departure from gaussianity on large angular scales .",
    "we used these indicators to search for the large - angle deviation from gaussianity in the three and five - year single frequency k , ka , q , v , and w maps with and without a _ kq75 _ mask .",
    "we have found strong deviation from gaussianity in the unmasked maps , whereas a _ kq75 _ mask lowers significantly the level of non - gaussianity ( for details see ref .  ) .",
    "motivated by the fact that most of gaussianity analyses with wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data have been carried out by using cmb frequency bands masked maps , and that sky cut can in principle induce bias in gaussianity analyses , in a more recent paper@xcite we have carried out an analysis of gaussianity of the available full - sky foreground - reduced _ five - year _",
    "cmb maps  @xcite by using the statistical indicators of ref .  .",
    "we have shown that the available full - sky five - year foreground - reduced maps present a significant deviation from gaussianity , which varies with the foreground - cleaning procedures .",
    "we have also shown that there is a substantial reduction in the level of deviation from gaussianity in these full sky maps when a _",
    "kq75 _ mask is used .",
    "our main aim here is to extend and complement our previous work@xcite by performing a similar analysis of gaussianity of the _ three - year _ harmonic ilc ( hilc ) maps@xcite foreground - reduced full - sky and _ kq75 _ masked maps . to this end , in the next section we give an account of the large - angle non - gaussianity indicators of ref .  , while in the last section we apply our indicators to perform a gaussianity analysis of the hilc three - year full - sky and _ kq75 _ cut - sky maps , and present our main results .",
    "our principal conclusion is that the hilc full - sky foreground - reduced maps presents a significant deviation from gaussianity , which is reduced to a level of consistency with gaussianity when the _ kq75 _ mask is employed .",
    "a constructive way of defining our non - gaussianity indicators @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( discrete functions defined on @xmath2 ) from cmb data can be formalized through the following steps :    take a finite set of points @xmath3 homogeneously distributed on the cmb celestial sphere @xmath2 as the centers of spherical caps of a given aperture @xmath4 ; and calculate for each cap @xmath5 the skewness and kurtosis given , respectively , by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of pixels in the @xmath8 cap , @xmath9 is the temperature at the @xmath10 pixel , @xmath11 is the cmb mean temperature of the @xmath8 cap , and @xmath12 is the standard deviation .",
    "clearly , the numbers @xmath13 and @xmath14 obtained in this way for each cap can be viewed as a measure of non - gaussianity in the direction of the center of the cap @xmath15 .",
    "patching together the @xmath13 and @xmath14 values for each spherical cap , one obtains our indicators , i.e. , discrete functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 defined over the celestial sphere , which can be used to measure the deviation from gaussianity as a function of the angular coordinates @xmath18 .",
    "the mollweide projection of skewness and kurtosis functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 are nothing but skewness and kurtosis maps , hereafter referred to them as @xmath19map and @xmath20map , respectively .",
    "clearly , the discrete functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be expanded into their spherical harmonics in order to determine their power spectra @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "thus , for example , for the skewness one has @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "similar expressions obviously hold for the kurtosis @xmath17 .",
    "in this section we shall report the results of our gaussianity analysis performed with @xmath16 and @xmath17 indicators calculated from the foreground reduced hilc full - sky and @xmath25 masked maps computed from three - year wmap data . and @xmath14 for a @xmath8 cap ( with pixels in the mask region ) are calculated with small number @xmath7 of pixels . ]         to minimize the statistical noise , in the calculations of @xmath19map and @xmath20map from the hilc foreground - reduced three - year map , we have scanned the celestial sphere with @xmath26 spherical caps of aperture @xmath27 , centered at points homogeneously generated on the two - sphere by using healpix@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the differential power spectrum of the skewness @xmath21 ( left panel ) and kurtosis @xmath22 ( right panel ) indicators for @xmath28 , calculated from _ full - sky _ and _ kq75 _ _ cut - sky _ three - year foreground - reduced hilc maps .",
    "the @xmath29 confidence level , obtained from @xmath0 and @xmath1 maps calculated from monte - carlo ( mc ) statistically gaussian cmb maps , is indicated in this figure . to the extent that the deviations @xmath30 and @xmath31 for these maps are not within @xmath29 of the mean mc value , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows an important deviation from gaussianity in full - sky foreground - reduced hilc three - year map .",
    "this figure also shows a significant reduction in the level of large - angle deviation from gaussianity when the _ kq75 _ mask is used .    to have an overall assessment power spectra @xmath32 and @xmath33 calculated from the hilc foreground - reduced three - year full and cut map ,",
    "we have performed a @xmath34 test to find out the goodness of fit for @xmath21 and @xmath22 multipole values as compared to the expected multipole values obtained from @xmath0 and @xmath1 maps calculated from monte - carlo ( mc ) statistically gaussian cmb maps .",
    "this gives a number for each case that quantifies collectively the deviation from gaussianity .",
    "for the power spectra @xmath32 and @xmath33 we found the values given in table  [ table1 ] for the ratio @xmath35 ( dof stands for degrees of freedom ) for the power spectra calculated from three - year hilc foreground - reduced full - sky and cut - sky maps .    clearly , the greater is the values for @xmath35 the smaller are the @xmath34 probabilities , that is the probability that the power spectra @xmath21 and @xmath22 and the expected mc power spectra agree .",
    "thus , from table  [ table1 ] is one concludes that the hilc presents the substantial level of deviation from gaussianity as detected by the indicators , which is reduced to a level that can be considered consistent with gaussianity when the _ kq75 _ mask is employed .",
    "finally we note that the relative deviation of the full - sky power spectrum from the cut - sky spectrum can be calculated with no reference to the gaussian mc spectra . to this end",
    ", we have performed a @xmath34 test to find out the goodness of fit for @xmath21 and @xmath22 multipole values for the full - sky maps as compared to the corresponding cut - sky values . for this relative assessment of power spectra @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    "we have found that @xmath35 are @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "these values make apparent the significant effect of the mask in the reduction of the deviation from gaussianity in the full - sky hilc three - year map , and give information on reliability of the hilc full - sky foreground - reduced three - year map as gaussian reconstruction of the whole cmb sky .",
