    "the study of correlations has been renewed again by the the discovery of high @xmath5 superconducting oxide materials ( htsc),@xcite since that these materials exhibit a short coherence lenght , @xmath6 , and a very large penetration depth , @xmath7 , which become them almost extreme type - ii superconductors , i.e. @xmath8 .    in order to study the effect of correlations we will use the on - site attractive hubbard hamiltonian put forward by micnas et al @xcite as a phenomenological model for describing the htsc .",
    "previous authors have used this model to study the bismuthate superconductors.@xcite denteneer et al @xcite recognize that if the phase diagram of the hubbard model were fully understood , it might form the basis of understanding correlated electrons as much as the ising model did for understanding critical phenomena .",
    "more recently , schneider et al@xcite have applied this model to explain universal properties of several families of these compounds , like the relation between transition temperature , magnetic penetration depth and gap , at zero temperature .    in this paper",
    ", we will use the exact relations of nolting@xcite for the one - particle diagonal spectral function together with the exact relations for the one - particle off - diagonal spectral function , i.e. , the anomalous green s function , to study systems with broken symmetry.@xcite the model we study is the following @xmath9 where @xmath10(@xmath11 ) are creation ( annihilation ) electron operators with spin @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 , @xmath14 is a hopping matrix element between the nearest sites ( n.n . )",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the onsite interaction .",
    "@xmath18 is the chemical potential and we work in the grand canonical ensemble . in the present study we consider an attractive interaction , @xmath19 .",
    "the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ ham ] )  has been studied in detail by micnas et al@xcite .",
    "nolting@xcite and kalashnikov and fradkin@xcite have derived exact relations for the one - particle spectral functions which are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "our ansatz is based on the assumption that the diagonal spectral function is modified by the presence of correlations ( we define correlations when we have the regime @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the bandwidth in two dimensions ) .",
    "this assumption has been numerically checked to be correct in ref.@xcite where the authors have obtained three bands for the diagonal spectral function and two bands for the off - diagonal spectral function after performing the analytical continuation . in eq .",
    "( [ diaspec ] ) , the first two poles represent the behavior around the chemical potential and the third pole is due to the influence of the upper hubbard band , which in the case of the atomic limit is the upper hubbard band or the band of single occupied states .",
    "the lower band , now split in two , is the band of double occupied states for the case of allmost atomic limit .",
    "please , see reference @xcite , where the attractive hubbard model has been studied in the normal phase with two different methods : @xmath25-matrix and moments .",
    "the order parameter , @xmath26 , and the chemical potential ( fixed electron density ) , @xmath18 , are calculated from the following equations : + @xmath27 for example , the quasi - particle energy , @xmath28 , has a gap . as it was discussed in ref.@xcite",
    ", the gap is expressed in terms of the order parameter as @xmath29 concluding from eq .",
    "( [ k - gap ] ) that our gap equation , which is a manifestation of singularities in the density of states , is @xmath30-dependent .",
    "going back to our local hamiltonian ( see eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) ) , which in reciprocal space is a constant , then at the mean field level we should obtain a _",
    "pure s - wawe _ , while going beyond mean field approximation we have been able to derive a @xmath30-dependent gap . in our case , by including correlations , i.e. , the selection rules for @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( see ref.@xcite for more details ) we have been able to modify the bcs results , from pure s - wave to a wave vector dependent energy gap .",
    "let us point out that in the attractive hubbard model we always find @xmath33type wave symmetry as it has conclusively shown in ref.@xcite in the hubbard - i approximation for both the diagonal and the off - diagonal one - particle green functions .",
    "we would like to call the reader s attention that our ansatz is based on the assumption that the role of correlations is mainly taken into account in the diagonal one - particle spectral function .",
    "this implies that the off - diagonal order parameter has been taken at the bcs level , i.e. , to @xmath34 . in a previous work,@xcite",
    "it is found that both the diagonal and off - diagonal spectral functions have four peaks , symmetric in pairs , for @xmath35 . however , when we have included double fluctuations , i.e. , fluctuations in both the diagonal and off - diagonal self - energies as in ref.@xcite , we have three resolved peaks for @xmath20 and two well resolved peaks for @xmath2 .",
    "so , ref.@xcite has motived us to adopt three and two peaks for @xmath20 and @xmath2 , respectively , for @xmath36 .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to wavevectors close to the chemical potential . if we want to consider two other peaks for the off - diagonal spectral function we have to include more moments , which is beyond the present work .",
    "also , we have neglected life - time effects in eqs .",
    "( [ diaspec]-[offspec ] ) , which would require to approach the phase transition with damping in the self - energy as it has been done in ref.@xcite .        in fig .",
    "1 we show the dependence of the diagonal spectral weigths , @xmath3 , j=1,2,3 along the diagonal of the brillouin zone . we can appreciate that the area of the spectral function is equal to one ( @xmath38 ) by construction .",
    "we have taken @xmath36 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "after self - consistency of our highly non - linear equations we obtain @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "it is worth mention that @xmath44 which indicates that we are in the low density regime ( bose - einstein limit ) . in fig .",
    "2 we have the diagonal spectral weights along the @xmath45-axis ( @xmath46 ) . what we observe is a strong variation of the @xmath3 with direction . in fig .",
    "3 we have the @xmath30-dependence of @xmath47 , j = 1,2 along the two directions as previously discussed in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "these @xmath47 s are defined by eq .",
    "( 19 ) in ref.@xcite .",
    "they are highly @xmath30-dependent .",
    "the meaning of these variables is that they represent corrections to the diagonal sum rules ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) .",
    "as we have said in ref.@xcite these corrections are important , i.e. , of the order of 20 - 25 higher corrections on the order parameter ( or equivalently , @xmath50 s ) . for @xmath51",
    "these corrections are not important , though .    by using the moment approach in the presence of off - diagonal long range order , i.e.,@xmath52 , to the negative hubbard model",
    ", we have worked out the superconducting phase calculated with the use of moments ( exact sum rules for both the diagonal and off - diagonal spectral densities ) with three and two and two peaks , respectively .",
    "the physical meaning of each of these peaks has been discussed .",
    "this assumption is equivalent to solve the diagonal spectral weights in powers of the order parameter square .",
    "at the same time , we have seen that the effect of the third band is to renormalize the order parameter producing an energy gap which is @xmath30-dependent . in consequence , in our approach the order parameter , @xmath26 , and the energy gap , @xmath53 are not the same .",
    "we would like to end by saying that there are strictly mean - field calculations ( even if they go beyond hartree - fock ) as the ones done by martn - rodero and flores@xcite and kuchiev and sushkov@xcite .",
    "our approach presented here is able to capture the double fluctuaction calculation of ref.@xcite .",
    "this clearly indicates that we are beyond a simple @xmath0 calculations .",
