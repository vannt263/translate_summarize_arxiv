    "for an arbitrary @xmath183 , one resonance is always below the smallest chemical potential and therefore inaccessible . increasing ( decreasing ) the microwave frequency",
    ", there is an upturn ( downturn ) in @xmath196 corresponding to the opening of the accessible transport channel .",
    "when @xmath191 , the spin up and down resonances , which in general have different spectral widths , exchange roles . because @xmath198 , the onset of the resonance occurs at different positions in the positive and negative - frequency regimes , hence some asymmetry in @xmath196 .",
    "( there is no asymmetry when @xmath151 because @xmath199 . ) using similar arguments , we explain the asymmetry in @xmath200 .",
    "the microwave responses for the interacting dot are smooth for positive frequencies when @xmath201 and for negative frequencies when @xmath202 .",
    "conversely , when the frequency is positive and @xmath202 or the frequency is negative and @xmath201 , the current response has several sharp features",
    ". informed by the previous section , we expect these features to correspond to either the opening of transport channels or partial restoration of the kondo resonances . the kondo resonance is now split by both the fictitious magnetic field and spin - dependent splittings of the fermi surfaces , both of which depend on the frequency of precession .",
    "one may show@xcite that a necessary condition for partial reconstruction of the kondo resonance , varying only @xmath181 , is @xmath203 , consistent with fig .",
    "[ gsall_k ] .",
    "for example ,",
    "when @xmath204 , there is a visible feature in @xmath196 at @xmath205 ( dashed vertical line ) . in fig .",
    "[ spin_dos ] , we plot the density of states when @xmath204 at frequency @xmath205 ( solid curve ) and @xmath206 ( dashed curve ) . in the plotted range of energy , there are three distinct peaks for @xmath205 and four for @xmath206 . the reduction in the number of peaks is due to the overlap of the resonances at @xmath207 , i.e. , a partial reconstruction of the original kondo peak .",
    "other features in the current response to microwaves may be explained analogously .",
    "in summary , correlation effects generically give rise to low energy peaks which manifest in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium spin currents . in equilibrium , this results in a characteristically larger spin current , as compared with the noninteracting case , as well as a nonmontonic dependence on the dot - lead tunneling rate .",
    "the exchange mediated by the spin current can therefore be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic as a function of the tunneling strength .",
    "when driven by voltage , many - body correlations enhance both the charge and spin conductance as a direct result of the additional transport through conductance channels associated with the kondo peaks .",
    "the enhancement is a manifestation of either the opening of additional transport or the partial reconstruction of kondo peaks split by the effective exchange field from the leads . at specific low energy values of voltage ,",
    "away from the dot resonance , the spin conductance can be increased by as a much as two orders of magnitude as compared with the noninteracting spin conductance .",
    "similarly , driving charge and spin transport by microwave precession enhances the charge and spin conductance .",
    "however , in contrast to voltage driving , the total effective exchange splitting on the dot and the bias dependence are both simultaneously dependent on the frequency of magnetic precession .",
    "we have shown that sharp features in the conductance , associated with the position of the kondo resonances , may only occur when the projection of the exchange field along the axis of magnetic precesision is negative .",
    "although our calculations have been done for a single dot , one may consider a tunnel junction wherein impurities may be treated as an ensemble of quantum dots . upon averaging over this ensemble , the characteristics of noninteracting dots in the spin current will be smeared out while preserving the signature of the interacting spin current induced by low energy peaks . as such ,",
    "introducing impurities in tunnel junctions can enhance charge and spin current at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "because correlation effects are responsible for these striking features at low energies , the current profiles , in turn , may help to elucidate many - body physics on quantum dots and in tunnel junctions .",
    "therefore , charge and spin conductance measurements driven by voltage , temperature , or magnetic precession could serve as a natural probe of correlated systems .",
