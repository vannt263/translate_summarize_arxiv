    "reactive molten silicon ( si ) infiltration into carbon ( c ) preforms is a process widely employed for the manufacturing of ceramic components designed for advanced applications @xcite .",
    "the liquid is introduced into the porous structure by capillary forces .",
    "this is possible because si reacts with c to form silicon carbide ( sic ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , si wets sic but it does not wet c. another important property of this reaction is that the sic formation leads to surface growth .",
    "the thickening of the surface behind the invading front results in a retardation of the infiltration process and it can also stop the fluid motion when pore closure occurs . on the other hand , the sic phase is a desired property since providing hardness to the material .",
    "furthermore , the surface reaction influences the hydrodynamic behavior of the melt significantly , since the infiltration dynamics does not follow the usual washburn behavior but it displays a linear dependence on time @xcite .    in this study ,",
    "the experiments of infiltration are performed with channels of millimeter width made in dense carbon preforms .",
    "this is done with the purpose to gain insight into the process of surface growth inside porous media at the micron scale .",
    "the advantage of the ideal system of a single channel is to retain the basic mechanisms underlying the surface reaction without the influence of the porous structure .",
    "the experiments clearly show that sic formation is determined by diffusion first through the liquid and then through the solid sic layer , much slower .",
    "of course , the complexity of the phenomenon goes beyond the capabilities of the models for the simulations used here ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : model ] ) . in order to elucidate this aspect , the role of the prior c dissolution and pockets formation",
    "is discussed in detail .",
    "nevertheless , it turns out that the models for the simulations proposed in this work can treat the process of surface growth leading to pore closure .",
    "this is important for the optimization of si - infiltrated ceramic composites and their manufacturing .",
    "the process of infiltration is simulated using the lattice - boltzmann ( lb ) method .",
    "this approach is based on the discretization of the velocity space , besides the usual discretization of the physical space .",
    "the hydrodynamic behavior can be reproduced in the incompressible limit at small mach numbers .",

    "the method is based on dimensionless numbers taking into account the effects of the surface reaction .",
    "interestingly , some properties of experimental systems can be addressed after a suitable calibration .",

    "the outcome of simulations proves to be in line with experimental observations for sic formation . in general",

    "this observation corroborates the mechanism of sic formation proposed in ref .",

    "also in the experimental work , the column of fluid above the opening of the channels can be assumed to be comparable to the length of the channels . as a consequence , the surface grows mainly under a regime of diffusion for mass transport .",
    "this means that an equivalence with the simulations can be established via the damkohler number @xmath156 @xcite . in order to estimate the experimental @xmath156 numbers we consider for the characteristic length of the systems the side of an equivalent square .",
    "given the diffusion coefficient @xmath157 [ m@xmath158/s ] @xcite and the reaction - rate constant @xmath159 [ m / s ] of si , it is found that the @xmath156 number varies in the range @xmath160 .",
    "it follows that the process of si diffusion is much faster than the reactivity . in the lb systems ,",
    "the length of the channels is set to @xmath161 [ lu ] , corresponding to @xmath140 [ mm ] ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : material ] ) .",
    "instead , the width of the simulation domain is determined by the aspect ratio of the experimental channels , leading to @xmath162 [ lu ] . by reproducing the experimental @xmath156 numbers",
    ", it is obtained that the reaction - rate constant for the simulations is the same for every system and equal to @xmath163 [ lu / ts ] . in the lb models for the reaction",
    ", the surface grows following a linear relation with time .",
    "for this reason we can only simulate the process up to the formation of a continuous sic layer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : process ] ) .",
    "the number of timesteps is derived by imposing that the surface grows for a distance corresponding to @xmath143 [ @xmath7 m ] during this time .",
    "it is found that the iterations amount to @xmath164 [ ts ] .",
    "the simulation domain is @xmath165 [ lu ] long .",
    "the channels start at @xmath166 [ lu ] ( @xmath161 [ lu ] ) .",
    "the system is filled with liquid and solute up to @xmath167 [ lu ] .",
    "the channel is thus immersed in the liquid and the system remains at rest .",
    "this state could have been reached after a previous phase of infiltration driven by an external acceleration . in experiments",
    "this regime is very short ( see eqs .  [",
    "eq : z1 ] and [ eq : z_w ] ) .",
    "the motivation of our choice is to maintain the same conditions for mass deposition .",
    "indeed , tests show that a contact angle of @xmath168 results in the possible appearance of the interface for solute near the walls .    figure [ fig : test ] shows the final profile of all channels .",
    "it is interesting to note that , as the height triples , the results remain comparable . furthermore , the target value of @xmath143 [ @xmath7 m ] for the maximal width of the sic layer is always neared .",
    "these properties are in agreement with experiments . for the larger channels ,",
    "the process of surface growth is slower .",
    "a possible reason is that the walls are more distant from the centerline , where the concentration of solute is higher . on the other hand , in this case",
    ", the sic layer tends to be uniform because there is more solute available in the systems .",
    "the simulations fail to reproduce a profile decreasing inside the channels .",
    "it is found that the surface grows from the extremities to the center . as a consequence ,",
    "a factor responsible for this shortcoming is that , in simulations , there is an additional source of solute close to the right opening of the channels .",
    "it turns out that this phenomenon is less marked with the smaller channel . in systems for porous structures the channels are quite narrower and not blind .",
    "these undesired effects should be weaker also by the presence of advection induced by the advancing front .",
    "additional experiments are carried out in order to single out the causes leading to a discrepancy for the sic profile .",
    "the channels have a diameter of @xmath25 [ mm ] with openings of inlet and outlet , as in simulations .",
    "furthermore , the preforms are in glassy carbon since this carbon is characterized by a reduced roughness , porosity and reactivity ( alfa aesar supplier ) .",
    "the experimental conditions are the same as before , except for the temperature set to @xmath169 [ c ] and the size of the si flakes ( below @xmath144 [ mm ] ) . in the first experiment ,",
    "the length of the channel is @xmath170 [ mm ] and the holding time is @xmath106 hours . at the outlet ,",
    "the flow is stopped by the formation of sic crystals .",
    "it is found that the sic growth around the capillary wall is uniform , forming a layer @xmath171 [ @xmath7 m ] thick .",
    "it turns out that the microstructure of the reaction - formed phase exhibits a higher roughness . in the second experiment ,",
    "the length of the channel is @xmath172 [ mm ] and the holding time is @xmath124 hours . in this case , at the outlet the infiltration stops with the formation of a pendant droplet .",
    "it is observed that the sic layer formed of is more compact but there is no significant difference in thickness .",
    "again , both phenomena can be ascribed to the slow process of c diffusion through the sic layer , affecting only the density .",
    "these results for channels with outlet compare better with the simulations of fig .",
    "[ fig : test ] .",
    "they also prove that the initial fast infiltration under the action of gravity has a marginal role for surface growth , as assumed in simulations .",
    "let us indicate by @xmath173 any force acting on the meniscus , i.e.  the interface , in eq .",
    "[ eq : washburn ] .",
    "let us assume that the radius shrinks as @xmath174 . from the experiments we also know that @xmath175 @xcite . if we replace into eq .",
    "[ eq : washburn ] with inertia neglected , it is found that the resistance from the reaction has the explicit form @xcite @xmath176 here @xmath88 is the interstitial velocity for a single channel .",
    "fluid flow through a porous medium is generally treated using the empirical result known as darcy law .",
    "it states that the following relation holds @xmath177 @xmath178 is the permealibity and @xmath179 the pressure . here",
    "@xmath180 is the superficial velocity ; by dividing it by the porosity , the interstitial velocity is obtained ( continuity of fluid flow ) . in the hagen - poiseuille model , the porous medium is regarded as an assembly of parallel capillary tubes @xcite . in this model , for reactive flow , the permeability takes the form @xcite",
    "@xmath181 @xmath63 is the initial porosity .",

    "the dependence on the surface tension , the contact angle and the viscosity is incorporated into the velocity @xmath88 .",

    "[ eq : f ] is correct .",
    "in this study , the focus is on millimeter - sized channels in order to elucidate relevant aspects of si infiltration into c preforms .",
    "a systematic series of experiments is performed with the purpose to detail the process of surface growth .",
    "the experimental work clearly shows that the formation of sic from the reaction between si and c proceeds through two stages .",
    "the first one is mainly responsible for the thickening of the sic layer .",
    "this stage is characterized by diffusion of reactants in the liquid . in the second stage",
    ", the diffusion of reactants occurs through the reaction - formed sic solid phase .",
    "this mechanism is much slower and has the effect to make the sic layer more uniform and compact .",
    "the system of a single channel has also the advantage to ease the comparison with simulations in order to improve the description of the surface reaction @xcite .",
    "dimensionless numbers are introduced with the aim to assess the accuracy of simulations involving surface growth .",
    "our analysis points out that the characteristic numbers lead to a consistent approach .",
    "this is critical for extensions to porous structures .",
    "furthermore , this work indicates that the models for the reaction support a proper implementation of the pore - closing phenomenon .",
    "this means that the important parameter of the reaction - rate constant can be regarded as an effective rate of growth .",
    "constraints arising from experiments can be imposed for the profile of the sic layer .",
    "there appears that in the diffusive regime the structure of the growing phase can be regarded as a crude approximation of the microstructure of sic .",
    "it is to be noted that infiltration velocities are low for real porous preforms @xcite .",
    "finally , this work represents a substantial step toward the simulation of reactive infiltration into porous structures .",
    "our investigation suggests that a correspondence between infiltrated distances in simulations and experiments can be established .",
    "furthermore , the comparison can be made more stringent by means of characteristic numbers taking into account the surface reaction .",
    "the properties of the forming sic layer reproduced by the models are also a positive indication .",
