    "width=336 ]    the majority of faint x - ray ( @xmath12ergs@xmath13 ) sources which have not been resolved but are expected to contribute to the gcdx are old binary systems such as cataclysmic variables . to investigate the contribution of the point sources , especially of the old stellar population detectable in our observations , we construct a longitudinal profile for the ratio of the stellar number density to the 6.7kev emission ( fig .",

    "the difference of the longitudinal profiles ( fig .",
    "1 , top panel ) is difficult to be explained by a variation of an emissivity of the point sources . in (",
    "* nishiyama et al . ( 2013 ) ) , we show that different initial mass functions , binary fractions , and star formation histories in the nsd and nsc from the gb can not explain the difference in the longitudinal profiles .",
    "another factor which can change the emissivity is a fe abundance",
    ". a higher fe abundance of stars in the nb region than the gb leads to a higher x - ray emissivity .",
    "however , the 6.7kev emission is @xmath18 times larger than the stellar number density in the nsd when they are shifted to have the same value at @xmath19 .",
    "it means that the required gradient of the fe abundance is @xmath20pc .",
    "this gradient is much larger than that in the inner galaxy ; an observed gradient of the fe abundance at the inner galaxy is @xmath21 0.06dex / kpc , which corresponds to only a few % /100pc ( ( * ? ? ? * gonzlez - fernndez et al .",

    "thus the abundance for old stars which could be the origin of the gcdx is expected to be lower than the solar fe abundance .",
    "the most puzzling aspect of the gcdx is its high temperature .",
    "since the @xmath22kev plasma is too hot to be gravitationally bound , it requires a huge energy source without the confinement of the plasma .",

    "if a large - scale toroidal mf is developed and sustained , and the mf is strong enough for nearly energy equipartition with the plasma of @xmath3kev , the gcdx could be almost confined within the nb .    to determine the large - scale interstellar mf configuration ,",

    ", the fields are nearly perpendicular to the plane , i.e. , poloidal configuration .",
    "this suggests a transition of the large - scale configuration , and such a transition can be naturally explained by the time evolution of mfs .",

    "if the plasma were not confined , it would be rushing out of the galactic plane vertically as a galactic wind .",
    "the escape velocity , typically several hundred kms@xmath13 , is smaller than the sound speed of the @xmath29kev hot plasma of @xmath30kms@xmath13 .",
    "assuming the gas flows out from the x - ray emitting region at the sound speed , the escape timescale is @xmath31yr ( ( * ? ? ?",
