    "cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature and polarization anisotropies have coherence beyond the horizon at the last scattering .",
    "this clearly shows that our universe has experienced accelerated expansion , i.e. , inflation , at a very early stage of the evolution .",
    "in particular , a single - field slow - roll inflation is consistent with the observations .    among many inflation models so far",
    ", there is an interesting class of models called large - field or chaotic inflation  @xcite .",
    "the simplest chaotic inflation is based on the quadratic potential where the inflaton mass is fixed to be order @xmath4gev by the normalization of the curvature perturbations .",
    "one of the advantages of the chaotic inflation is that it has no initial condition problem . with the chaotic initial condition at the planckian epoch ,",
    "some patch of the universe will necessarily start to inflate .",
    "for this , the initial inflaton field value has to be larger than the planck scale @xmath5 by many orders of magnitude , and it is customary to impose a shift symmetry on the inflaton to keep the inflaton potential under control .",
    "after inflation ends , the inflaton must decay into the standard model ( sm ) particles to reheat the universe .",
    "also , a right amount of baryon asymmetry needs to be created after inflation because any pre - existing baryon number is exponentially diluted by the inflationary expansion .",
    "these two issues are highly model - dependent , and often treated separately from the inflation model building .",
    "the purpose of the present letter is twofolds .",
    "first , we provide a viable chaotic inflation in supergravity , which automatically explains neutrino masses and the origin of baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "to illustrate the idea , let us consider a simple quadratic chaotic inflation in supergravity , which necessitates two singlet superfields  @xcite , the inflaton @xmath6 and the stabilizer field @xmath7 , with the superpotential w_inf = m s , where @xmath8gev is the inflaton mass .",
    "the khler potential is assumed to respect a shift symmetry of the inflaton along the imaginary direction , + a , where @xmath9 $ ] and @xmath10 is the real transformation parameter .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath12 are singlets under the sm gauge symmetry , and therefore , they naturally couple to the lepton @xmath13 and higgs @xmath14 doublets , w_yukawa ~s l h_u + l h_u , where we have omitted coupling constants and the flavor indices . then , integrating out the heavy inflaton and stabilizer fields , one can explain the light neutrino masses by the seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "note that the suggested inflaton mass of order @xmath4gev is intriguingly close to the right - handed ( rh ) neutrino mass scale required by the seesaw mechanism .",
    "after inflation , the inflaton decays into leptons and higgs fields , and the reheating temperature is considered to be so high that successful thermal leptogenesis is possible .",
    "thus , the seesaw mechanism as well as leptogenesis are natural outcomes of the chaotic inflation . as a result",
    ", both the inflaton and stabilizer fields can be identified with the rh sneutrinos , and they are expressed as @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the following .",
    "note here that the neutrino oscillation data can be explained with only two rh neutrinos  @xcite .    in this chaotic inflation with the seesaw mechanism ,",
    "the inflaton as well as the stabilizer field have sizable neutrino yukawa couplings of @xmath17 , and therefore , the chaotic initial condition with super - planckian inflaton field values can not be realized .",
    "this is because the masses of the leptons and higgs would exceed the planck mass for the inflaton field value greater than @xmath18 , and then , the effective field theory description breaks down .",
    "our second purpose is to propose a solution to the problem and study its implications .",
    "in fact , the problem can be solved if the neutrino yukawa couplings are some functions of the inflaton so that the masses of the leptons and higgs do not monotonically increase with the inflaton field ; for example , they may asymptote to a constant value or start to decrease for super - planckian inflaton field values .",
    "an interesting possibility is that the system comes back to the sm as the inflaton field exceeds a critical value .",
    "this is the case if the shift symmetry of the inflaton is not completely broken by the superpotential interactions , but there remains an unbroken discrete shift symmetry .",
    "that is to say , the superpotential interactions are invariant under the following discrete shift transformation along the imaginary direction , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the decay constant . in general",
    ", the inflaton potential is given by a sum of sinusoidal functions with different height and potential , the so - called multi - natural inflation  @xcite . to avoid the blow - up of the masses of leptons and higgs",
    ", @xmath20 should be smaller than or comparable to @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the prediction of the scalar spectral index @xmath21 as well as the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath22 are naturally deviated from the simple quadratic chaotic inflation .",
    "as we shall see , for @xmath23 , the predicted @xmath24 can lie in the range preferred by the planck data .",

    "now let us consider the reheating after inflation . in our model ,",
    "the reheating process is slightly nontrivial because of the large yukawa coupling of the inflaton . just after inflation",
    ", the inflaton @xmath49 begins a coherent oscillation with its amplitude of order @xmath155 , and the coupled charged leptons and higgs ( and their superpartners ) obtain masses of order @xmath156 where @xmath157 collectively denotes the neutrino yukawa coupling . since this is much larger than the inflaton mass @xmath37 ,",
    "the perturbative decay of the inflaton is not kinematically allowed . instead ,",
    "non - perturbative particle production , called preheating , happens when @xmath49 passes the origin @xmath158  @xcite .",
    "the produced particles decay into lighter ones before the inflaton again moves back to @xmath158  @xcite .",
    "for example , higgs boson decays into quarks through yukawa couplings .",
    "the effective decay rate of @xmath49 through this process is estimated as  @xcite @xmath159 where @xmath160 collectively denotes the higgs coupling to lighter particles and @xmath161 .",
    "thus after a few hubble time after inflation , a significant fraction of the inflaton energy density is transferred to radiation : @xmath162 if this process continues to produce radiation even after the radiation energy density begins to dominate the universe , the reheating temperature is given by @xmath163 on the other hand this preheating process may become ineffective due to the thermal mass correction to the higgs particles .",
    "then the main process that transfers the inflaton energy to radiation becomes the scattering of light particles in thermal plasma with inflaton . in our case , at the high inflaton amplitude regime @xmath164 , it is the effective inflaton coupling with su(2 ) gauge bosons after integrating out heavy higgs and leptons that is responsible for such an effective dissipation rate .",
    "the oscillation - averaged dissipation rate is estimated as  @xcite @xmath165 where @xmath166 is an order one numerical constant , @xmath167 is the su(2 ) fine structure constant and @xmath168 denotes the oscillation amplitude of @xmath49 .",
    "the inflaton is thermalized when this rate becomes comparable to the hubble scale .",
    "this occurs at @xmath169 .",
    "thus the reheating temperature in this case is estimated to be @xmath170 in either case , the reheating temperature is so high that the rh sneutrino inflaton becomes thermalized .",
    "now let us consider implication for the leptogenesis scenario  @xcite . in our model ,",
    "two rh neutrino masses are nearly degenerate , and so , we must take account of the resonant effect  @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that the effective cp asymmetry in the rh neutrino decay vanishes in the exact degenerate limit . and @xmath34 without affecting the rh mass term , while it can absorb the phase of yukawa matrix which appears in the cp asymmetric decay of rh neutrinos .",
    "this phase rotation is allowed only for the degenerate case , i.e. , there are no diagonal elements in the mass matrix of rh neutrinos . ]",
    "thus we need a small diagonal mass matrix element of @xmath171 @xmath172 in ( [ wapp ] ) . , it does not much affect the inflaton dynamics . ] after diagonalizing the rh neutrino mass matrix , we obtain @xmath173 the lepton asymmetry is generated via the cp asymmetric decay of @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "the cp asymmetry parameter is given by @xmath176}{8\\pi   ( \\tilde y_{i\\alpha}\\tilde y^\\dagger_{\\alpha i } ) }      \\frac{\\tilde m_i\\tilde m_j(\\tilde m_i^2- \\tilde m_j^2)}{(\\tilde m_i^2- \\tilde m_j^2)^2 + r^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath177 denotes the regulator , which is of the order of @xmath178 with @xmath179 being the decay width of rh neutrino  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath180 parameter is maximized and can be @xmath181 for @xmath182 .",
    "the final baryon asymmetry , after the sphaleron conversion of the lepton number to the baryon number , is given by @xmath183 where @xmath184 represents the suppression factor due to the washout effect  @xcite . in our case ,",
    "rh neutrinos are expected to be in thermal equilibrium at @xmath185 : @xmath186 .",
    "thus we have @xmath187 .",
    "to explain the observed value @xmath188 , we need @xmath189 . in a degenerate limit  @xcite . ]",
    "finally we discuss the gravitino problem . in general , there are two contributions to the gravitino production : thermal production and nonthermal production .",
    "the nonthermal gravitino production rate from the direct decay of the inflaton depends on the inflaton vacuum expectation value  @xcite . in our model , thanks to the @xmath33 symmetry , the inflaton vev is zero and hence there is no significant production of the gravitino from the inflaton decay .",
    "thermal gravitino production , on the other hand , is very efficient in the present model because of high reheating temperature .",
    "the gravitino abundance in terms of the number to the entropy density ratio is estimated as  @xcite @xmath190 where @xmath191 and @xmath192 denote the gluino mass and gravitino mass , respectively .",
    "the cosmological consequences depend on the gravitino mass . for the unstable gravitino , in order to avoid the constraint from big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn )  @xcite , we need @xmath193tev so that it decays before bbn begins",
    ". however , even in such a case , the lightest susy particles ( lsp ) produced by the gravitino decay give a too large contribution to the relic dark matter abundance independently of the gravitino mass , if we assume the anomaly mediation relation between the gaugino and gravitino mass  @xcite .    a solution to the lsp overproduction is to introduce a small r - parity violation so that lsp decays quickly before bbn  @xcite . another way to avoid the gravitino problem",
    "is to assume an ultra light gravitino scenario in which @xmath194ev  @xcite . a small amount of late - time entropy production after the lsp freezeout also helps the situation .",
    "in such a case , baryon asymmetry is also diluted but in the present scenario it is easy to create larger amount of lepton asymmetry due to the resonant effect .",
    "in this letter we have shown that the seesaw mechanism as well as thermal leptogenesis are built - in features of the chaotic inflation in supergravity .",
    "a successful chaotic inflation in supergravity requires two superfields , the inflaton and the stabilizer fields , which , being singlets under the sm gauge symmetry , naturally couple to the lepton and higgs doublets .",
    "the typical mass scale of the inflaton and stabilizer fields is of order @xmath4gev , which is fixed by the normalization of the curvature perturbations . integrating out the heavy inflaton and stabilizer fields ,",
    "then , one naturally explains the light neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism .",
    "also , the inflaton decays into leptons and higgs after inflation , and the reheating temperature is considered to be so high that thermal leptogenesis works .",
    "thus , the inflaton and stabilizer fields are subsequently identified with the rh sneutrinos .",
    "there is one potential problem of the sneutrino chaotic inflation model .",
    "as the inflaton has initially super - planckian field values , the effective masses of the lepton and higgs fields may exceed the planck mass , and the effective field theory description may break down . to avoid the super - planckian masses of the leptons and higgs during inflation , we have assumed that the shift symmetry of the inflaton is not completely broken by the superpotential interactions , but there remain an unbroken discrete shift symmetry , which modifies the shape of the inflaton potential . as a result ,",
    "we can obtain the prediction of @xmath108 within @xmath195 range of the planck result if the decay constant @xmath20 is @xmath196 .",
    "while the reheating temperature is predicted to be so high that leptogenesis successfully works , gravitinos are also copiously produced , which leads to a cosmological problem .",
    "several solutions to the gravitino problem were also discussed .",
    "since we have only two rh neutrinos , one of the light neutrinos is massless .",
    "therefore , @xmath197 , which is a quantity directly probed by the neutrinoless double beta decay experiments , is bounded below in our model and predicted to be @xmath198mev for nh and @xmath199mev for ih with a slight dependence on the majorana phase @xmath26 .",
    "although the rate of neutrinoless double beta decay is suppressed compared to the ( quasi ) degenerate case and below the current sensitivity ( @xmath200ev ) , it is within the reach of forthcoming experiments  @xcite .",
    "inflaton has rather large yukawa couplings to explain observed neutrino masses and hence the reheating automatically happens .",
