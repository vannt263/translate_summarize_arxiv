    "one of the interesting characteristics of the percolation model is the existence of universal quantities , which are independent of the microscopic qualities of the system .",
    "critical exponents and amplitude ratios are examples of one class of universal quantities that are only dependent on the dimensionality of the system .",
    "shape - dependent universal quantites , which depend on the shape of the boundary as well as the dimensionality of the system , have been identified in the ising model by privman and fisher @xcite , mller @xcite and kamieniarz and blte @xcite . in percolation ,",
    "recent research has been focused on shape - dependent universal quantities such as the crossing probabilities @xcite and the excess number of clusters @xcite .",
    "the excess number of clusters @xmath0 on a two dimensional system is defined by @xcite @xmath8 as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the total number of the clusters in a system of area @xmath11 , and @xmath1 is the number of clusters per unit area in an infinite system . in ( [ definition ] ) , it is assumed that the system is at criticality , and that there are no boundaries to the system .",
    "the average density of clusters @xmath1 is a non - universal quantity , meaning that it depends on the microscopic qualities of the system and will have different values for different systems . in two - dimensional percolation , exact values of @xmath1 have been determined theoretically for bond percolation on two lattices @xcite .",
    "also , simulations have provided precise values of @xmath1 for 2d @xcite and 3d @xcite lattice percolation .    while @xmath1 is a system - dependent quantity ,",
    "@xmath0 is a universal quantity that is independent of the type of percolation but does depend on shape of the system boundary and the dimensionality of the system .",
    "previous work has demonstrated the shape dependence of @xmath0 for toroidal systems using @xmath12 sytems with periodic boundary conditions , for which @xmath13 has been found exactly @xcite .",
    "for an @xmath2 system , the theoretical prediction is @xmath14 @xcite , which agrees with the numerical value @xmath15 @xcite found for site and bond percolation on square and triangular lattices . for 3d lattice percolation ,",
    "theoretical predictions for @xmath16 ( the excess number per unit length ) do not exist ; however , the universality of @xmath16 has been confirmed using numerical values for different @xmath17 cubic systems @xcite .    in the present paper , we are interested in finding @xmath0 for percolation on the surface of a sphere , another two dimensional surface with no boundaries , for which however no theoretical prediction exists . in order to do this , we use the 2d continuum `` swiss cheese '' model of percolation , for which the critical density has recently been found to high accuracy @xcite .",
    "in addition to the spherical systems , we are interested in using this continuum model to detemine @xmath0 for @xmath2 toroidal systems and comparing it to the theoretical prediction . in order to find @xmath0 , we must also find @xmath1 , the number of clusters per unit area for the continuum percolation model .",
    "we note that continuum percolation on the surface of a sphere ( and hypersphere ) has also been studied in a recent publication @xcite , in the context of diffusion on fractal clusters .    in the following section ,",
    "we describe the simulations that were used to model the square and spherical system",
    ". then we present and summarize our results for the excess number of clusters and the average density of clusters in these systems .",
    "the basic `` cluster counting '' algorithm that was used for determining the number of clusters in the @xmath2 toroidal and spherical continuum systems is identical to the algorithm we used to study similar problems in lattice percolation . however , the implementation of this algorithm was quite different for the two continuum systems .",
    "the @xmath2 system with periodic boundary conditions was first divided into squares of unit area .",
    "discs , whose radius @xmath18 is equal to 0.5 , were distributed into each of the unit squares in the plane using a poisson function , where the probability @xmath19 that there are @xmath20 particles in a given volume @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the critical density of discs ( @xmath24 for 2d continuum percolation of discs @xcite ) and @xmath25 is the volume of each of the unit squares .",
    "[ note : the critical density of discs is often referred to as @xmath1 in the continuum percolation literature , but in order to differentiate from the average density @xmath1 , we use @xmath23 here . ]   the algorithms in ref.@xcite were used to generate numbers with this distribution . for each unit square , a random number @xmath20 was generated and if @xmath26 , then @xmath20 discs were placed within that square .",
    "the @xmath27- and @xmath28- coordinates of each disc were stored in two one - dimensional arrays , which were indexed by the order that the discs were distributed ( i.  e. , the first sphere placed is numbered 0 , the second is numbered 1 , @xmath29 ) . the index of the first and last disc distributed in the square were also stored in two one - dimensional pointer arrays .",
    "after discs were placed in each unit square , a search was made for clusters , starting with the first disc placed in the first unit square .",
    "the search checked only the neighboring eight unit squares , as opposed to the entire system , for discs .",
    "if the distance between any two discs was less than or equal to 1 , then the two were considered to be in the same cluster .",
    "the coordinates of each disc in the cluster were stored in two one - dimensional list ( `` growth '' ) arrays , which were indexed by the order that the discs were determined to be part of the cluster .",
    "after the first disc was checked for overlapping neighbors , then subsequent discs on the list arrays were checked , in the order that they were placed on the list , for overlapping neighbors .",
    "this process was continued until a cluster stopped growing ; at which time , the same search for each of the unchecked discs in the current square was performed .",
    "after each of the discs in a square were checked , the search moved to the next square that had unchecked discs remaining .",
    "this cluster search was continued until all discs within the system were determined to be part of a cluster .",
    "when simulating the spherical systems , we encountered two areas of difficulty that were not present when using the @xmath2 system .",
    "first , we were nt able to divide the surface into smaller sub - sections because of the difficulty in producing equal area sub - sections . instead , the discs were distributed on the surface of the entire sphere , using ( [ poisson ] ) to determine the number , and the @xmath30-coordinate and the cosine of the @xmath31-coordinate for each disc were stored in two one - dimensional arrays .",
    "the entire list was searched for each neighbor check , resulting in a much slower simulation for larger spherical systems compared to the toroidal system .",
    "we began our cluster search algorithm with the first disc that was placed on the sphere .",
    "the `` great circle '' distance between two discs @xmath32 , whose coordinates are ( @xmath33 ) and ( @xmath34 ) , is given by @xmath35 which is the arc length between two points on the surface of a sphere of radius @xmath36 .",
    "two discs were considered to be overlapping if @xmath37 .",
    "the cluster search algorithm was applied to the spherical system until every disc on the sphere was checked .",
    "the second area of difficulty we encountered was in the selection of a criterion for the critical threshold that is consistant with the criterion used for a @xmath2 system .",
    "different choices ( density of discs , surface area coverage , etc . ) lead to different numbers of discs . as a result of this ambiguity , we considered two different methods to determine the average number of discs that were required . in general , the total number of the discs @xmath38 is defined as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the area covered by each disc , @xmath41 is the coverage of the discs , and @xmath11 is the total area of the system . for a finite system , @xmath42 , where @xmath23 is the critical density of discs .",
    "first , we used `` type 1 '' discs , where we chose the number of discs per unit area on the sphere to have the same value as the @xmath2 critical system .",
    "therefore , the number of discs is @xmath43 , where @xmath36 is the radius of the sphere and @xmath24 is the critical density of discs for a flat system .    for the second type of discs ( `` type 2 '' discs )",
    ", we determined the number of discs required to keep the critical coverage the same as it was for a flat system .",
    "the area covered by each disc is calculated by @xmath44 where @xmath36 is the radius of the sphere , @xmath31 is the angle between the horizontal axis of the sphere and a point on the surface of the sphere , and @xmath45 is the angle between the edge of the disc and the horizontal axis as shown in fig .",
    "[ geo ] . in this case",
    "@xmath46 , therefore , the area covered by each type 2 disc is @xmath47 the number @xmath38 of these discs that would be required to achieve the same coverage as the @xmath2 system ( @xmath48 ) was determined using ( [ coverage ] ) , with the result that @xmath49 where @xmath36 is the radius of the sphere , where @xmath50 .    using these two simulations",
    ", we were able to study planar @xmath2 systems , where @xmath51 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 , and 128 , and spherical systems with radius @xmath52 5 , 6 , 10 , and 15 .",
    "the simulations counted the number of clusters that existed within the system .",
    "numerous realizations ( @xmath53 for spherical systems and @xmath54 for planar systems ) were averaged over in order to calculate the density of clusters within each system .",
    "the random numbers used in these simulations were generated by the four - tap shift - register rule @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the exclusive - or operation @xcite .",
    "the number of clusters @xmath10 present in a system which has area @xmath11 is expected to follow ( [ definition ] ) .",
    "using our simulations , we were able to calculate the total number of clusters present and then determine the overall density of clusters @xmath57 for each system size , which by rearranging ( [ definition ] ) is @xmath58 , or @xmath59",

    ", we were able to determine the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for these systems from the slope and the intercept , respectively , which are summarized in table [ results ] .",
    "several observations can be made from these results .",
    "first , the average density of clusters for the spherical systems and for the @xmath2 system is , as expected , the same ( within numerical error ) .",
    "also , the excess number of clusters @xmath0 for the planar @xmath3 continuum system is consistent with the theoretical value ( @xmath61 ) @xcite and the simulation value ( @xmath15 ) @xcite found for the @xmath3 lattice percolation system , which further confirms the universality of this quantity . finally , the values of the excess number of clusters @xmath0 for the spherical systems are different than that found for the planar system , which is expected because the shape and topology of the boundary is different . however , there is a difference in the value of @xmath0 for the two spherical systems , which is a result of the different definitions for the critical number of discs placed on the surface of the sphere .    when the total number of discs @xmath38 that are placed on the sphere in each case are compared , the difference in @xmath0 becomes more understandable : @xmath62 \\nonumber\\\\ & m = \\rho_c ( 4\\pi r^{2 } ) + \\rho_c ( \\pi/12 ) + o(1/r^{2 } \\ldots ) \\quad [ { \\rm type\\ 2\\ discs } ] .",
    "\\label{comparenumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] wherethe second expression follows from a taylor series expansion of ( [ number3 ] ) .",
    "the first term in the expression for type 2 discs is exactly the number of type 1 discs present on the surface of the sphere .",
    "however , the second term shows that of the order of one more disc is present on the surface of the sphere than type 1 disc at the same ( critical ) density .",
    "these relatively small differences in the number of discs present on the sphere can cause a significant difference in the density of clusters . in general , about the critical point , one expects the density of clusters to behave as @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 in two dimensions , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 . then the number of clusters @xmath10 is @xmath67 therefore , if @xmath38 changes by an amount of order 1 , then @xmath10 will also change by an amount of order 1 , which is the same order as the @xmath0 term in ( [ definition ] ) .",
    "thus , the slight differences in the two definitions of the total number of discs @xmath38  even though they are asymptotically identical for large @xmath36  lead to non - zero differences in the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the universality of the excess number of clusters @xmath0 has been demonstrated using 2-d and 3-d lattice percolation , but it had never been tested with a continuum model .",
    "our result @xmath68 for the @xmath3 planar system is the same as found for the @xmath2 lattice percolation system @xcite , thus it further confirms the universality of this quantity .",
    "the excess number of clusters had never been calculated for spherical systems . by using the swiss cheese continuum model",
    ", we were able to study percolation on the surface of sphere .",
    "we found that the excess number of clusters ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) is slightly dependent upon the definition of the critical density of discs for the spherical system .",
    "we believe that the type 2 definition is the most reasonable as it is based upon the idea that the surface coverage is the same as the planar system , which is consistent with the fact that the surface coverage is invariant when the @xmath2 periodic system is deformed to a torus .",
    "therefore , we propose the value @xmath71 for the spherical surface . while theoretical results exist for @xmath0 for the @xmath72 periodic system , there is no prediction for the sphere .",
