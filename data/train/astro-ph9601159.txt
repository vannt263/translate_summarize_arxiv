    "since the accreted matter is likely to carry some angular momentum , it is common to invoke the presence of an accretion disk .",
    "a strong observational evidence for such disks comes from the spectral flattening in the optical / uv seen in many agn , the so  called  big blue bump  ( e.  g.  shields @xcite ; malkan & sargent @xcite ) .",

    "the simplest way to calculate the emitted disk spectrum is to assume that the disk is geometrically thin but optically thick and radiates locally as a blackbody .",
    "the effective temperature @xmath17 of the blackbody is then solely determined by the dissipated flux per unit area .",
    "these simple disk models , however , are not able to produce soft x  rays as long as they do not become super  eddington ( e.  g.  bechtold et al .",
    "real disk spectra will differ from the blackbody approximation : for sufficiently high accretion rates and viscosity parameters , the accretion disk eventually becomes effectively optically thin at small radii and the gas temperature strongly deviates from the equilibrium temperature in such cases . even in the optically thick case",
    "the local spectra differ from the blackbody , because the scattering opacity dominates over absorption in the soft x ",

    "is related to the @xmath51@xmath20component of the viscous stress tensor @xmath52 by    @xmath53    and @xmath54 can be expressed in terms of velocity gradients leading to the result    @xmath55    with the shear viscosity @xmath56 .    in a steady state",
    "this heating rate must be balanced by the total radiative cooling , since convection is not considered in this model .",
    "integration of the right  hand side of equation ( [ rad1 ] ) over frequency @xmath57 leads to the following energy balance equation    @xmath58    the disk model is so far described by the equations ( [ hyd ] ) , ( [ rad1 ] ) , ( [ rad2 ] ) , ( [ state ] ) and ( [ ebal ] ) which can be solved numerically when proper boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "the only unspecified process is the source of viscosity and this will be discussed in the next section .    because of symmetry reasons",
    "the inner boundary condition in the midplane of the disk ( @xmath59 ) is taken as    @xmath60    and at the upper boundary ( at @xmath61 ) we assume that the disk radiates isotropically into the vacuum    @xmath62    for a geometrically thin accretion disk the energy flux from the disk surface ( @xmath61 ) is    @xmath63    where @xmath1 is the total mass flux through the disk .",
    "finally , the disk height @xmath19 is specified by the condition    @xmath64    we solve the above set of equations for the functions @xmath18 , @xmath42 , @xmath19 , @xmath32 , and @xmath65 using a finite difference scheme in both variables @xmath21 and @xmath57 .",
    "the vertical structure is resolved with 100 points on a logarithmic grid , and 64 grid points are used in frequency space .",
    "the resulting set of algebraic difference equations is then solved by a newton  raphson method .",
    "once the vertical structure has been determined we can integrate the density profiles to obtain the surface density @xmath66 and the average radial velocity @xmath67 . in order to justify the basic assumptions of the thin disk model",
    "one must have @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the keplerian velocity .      in the standard @xmath2-model ( ss73 ) the viscous stress tensor component @xmath54 is propotional to the pressure @xmath70",
    "this is a consequence of a number of assumptions : first , the viscosity is caused by turbulence in the disk , and the magnitude of @xmath56 can be estimated from a dimensional analysis @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the size and the typical velocity of the largest turbulent eddies , respectively .",
    "next , the disk height @xmath19 is used for @xmath72 which is obtained from the hydrostatic equation ( [ hyd ] )    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the pressure in the midplane , and @xmath76 stands for the average density .",
    "the turbulent velocity @xmath73 is assumed to be limited by the local sound speed @xmath77 .",
    "otherwise shocks would develop and heat the gas until the tubulence is subsonic .",
    "approximating the ratio @xmath78 by the local value @xmath79 and inserting the above relations into equation ( [ shear ] ) for the viscous shear leads to the expression ( [ alpha ] ) , where the constant @xmath2 takes up all uncertainties in terms of numerical factors .",
    "this entire procedure is quite successful for the standard disks in cataclysmic variables which are dominated by the gas pressure .",
    "if radiation pressure becomes important a number of difficulties arise when the model is applied without modifications . according to equation ( [ rad1 ] ) the radiative cooling decreases in the upper layers of the disk where the density drops exponentially .",
    "since the radiation pressure remains finite in this region , the total heating rate ( [ visc ] ) can not be balanced by radiative losses .",
    "this could be cured by replacing @xmath29 in equation ( [ alpha ] ) by the gas pressure , however , in an optically thick regime the radiation behaves like a gas exchanging momentum with the plasma and thus contributes to the viscous shear .",
    "in addition , in a radiation dominated disk gravity is mainly balanced by radiative forces and the disk height is then given by    @xmath80    where @xmath81 is a flux weighted average opacity    @xmath82",
    "this height does not contain the sound speed . in order to derive a consistent parameterization of the turbulent viscosity for the radiation dominated case",
    "we start from the dimensional analysis ( [ eta ] ) using again @xmath83 , where the disk height @xmath19 is self  consistently calculated in our model . for the limitation of the velocity @xmath73",
    "the same arguments as in ss73 are used , i.e. @xmath73 has to be small enough that no entropy due to shock waves is generated in the flow . for a radiation dominated shock in an optically thick medium    @xmath84    but in an optically thin regime , where the photons are able to escape freely @xmath85 this follows from considering an isothermal shock in a plasma with radiation when the mach number approaches unity .",

    "this layer is however optically thin to both scattering and absorption ( the typical densities are below @xmath138 ) , and thus there is no effect on the emitted spectrum . note that in the upper disk layers the viscous heating is proportional to the density , thus the relevant cooling mechanisms must not have a stronger @xmath18dependence .",

    "the calculated spectra become more and more flat , producing quasi power law spectra in the sensitivity range of the rosat pspc , whereas for small values a steep soft x - ray component is established .",
    "thus , the model can in general account for the soft x  ray excess observed in many agn .",
    "we intend to show detailed spectral fits of this model to combined rosat and iue observations for a sample of agn in a future paper .",
    "note that we have neglected induced processes and that our opacity description only contains free  free processes for a pure hydrogen atmosphere .",
    "neglecting induced processes means , that we have concentrated on the high energy tail of the resulting spectra . nevertheless , bound ",
    "free absorption and line opacities can significantly contribute to the total opacity especially at low temperatures .",
    "therefore , the spectrum is expected to soften when all relevant opacities are taken into account because of the increasing effective optical depth in this case .",
    "another important point is the role of convection in our calculations , especially in view of our inverse density profiles .",
    "if convective energy transport takes place in the disk , the vertical structure and subsequently the emergent spectrum may be altered considerably .",
    "we therefore have done a simplified stability analysis according to the standard mixing length theory ( see for example cox & giuli @xcite ) , assuming that the convective elements move adiabatically in the disk and that the local gas temperature is given by the equilibrium temperature @xmath139 . in a gas with radiation pressure ,",
    "the effective buoyancy force is reduced by the radiation pressure gradient and the convective flux then can be expressed in terms of the effective gravitational acceleration @xmath171 ( equation [ hyd2 ] ) , @xmath172 where @xmath173 , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 are the mixing length , the pressure scale height and the specific heat at constant pressure , respectively , and @xmath176 .",
    "@xmath177 and @xmath178 are the temperature gradients with respect to pressure for the surroundings and the rising element .",
    "therefore , the disk is unstable for convection if the square root on the right hand side of equation ( [ convec ] ) has a positive argument . in the sub ",
    "eddington regime one has @xmath179 and the condition for convection to set in is given by the schwarzschild criterion @xmath180 .",
    "on the other hand in the super  eddington regime @xmath181 , and the condition for convective instability is @xmath182 , leading to a convective energy flux in negative @xmath21direction .",
    "our model calculations show that none of both conditions are satisfied and the disk therefore is stable against convection .",
    "since the gas temperature deviates from the equilibrium temperature for an effectively optically thin disk and the convective elements do not move adiabatically in the upper optically thin layers , this simplified stability analysis has to be considered with caution , and a more detailed stability analysis has to be performed in order to clarify the role of convection .",
    "it is well known that an @xmath2-disk with a viscosity proportional to the total pressure is radially unstable in the radiation dominated case ( lightman & eardly @xcite ) . however , this analysis is based on a vertically integrated disk structure . since our model leads to a strong @xmath21-dependence for almost all functions including the viscosity ,",
    "a detailed 2-dimensional stability analysis would be required for a definite answer concerning the overall stability of our model .",
