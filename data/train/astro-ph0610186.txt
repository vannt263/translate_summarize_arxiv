    "star formation studies have in recent years benefited from a fresh , `` large scale '' view , via observations of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) and large clusters of clumps and cores at infrared and ( sub)millimetre wavelengths , and through studies of the interplay between the thousands of evolving young sources within each region .",
    "infrared survey instrumentation that offers an unparalleled field of view at high spatial resolution is now , or will soon be , available at modest - sized telescopes across the globe .",
    "one such instrument is the near - infrared ( near - ir ) wide field camera , wfcam , at the u.k .",
    "infrared telescope ( ukirt ) .",
    "wfcam provides deep imaging of degree - sized regions in broad and narrow - band filters in just a few hours .",
    "when combined with photometric data at longer wavelengths , e.g. from the submillimeter common user bolometer array ( scuba - soon to be replaced by scuba-2 ) and the spitzer space telescope , obtaining a complete picture of evolving star formation ( stellar populations , the imf , the clump mass function , etc . )",
    "becomes possible .",
    "complementary wide - field optical images of herbig - haro ( hh ) jets , and future large - scale ( sub)millimetre surveys of molecular `` co '' outflows , may also be used to examine the dynamic processes that shape  through the injection of turbulence or triggered cloud collapse ",
    "star formation across each gmc .",
    "one region that has already benefited from wide - field observations with spitzer , scuba and now wfcam is the dr21/w75s , dr21(oh ) and w75n complex of massive star forming cores in cygnus x ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a more recent overview of the cygnus x complex of gmcs see schneider et al .",
    "the dr21 core contains two well - studied cometary hii regions @xcite and an h@xmath0o maser @xcite , while dr21(oh ) , a dense core roughly 3  to the north of dr21 , is abundant with methanol , water and oh masers ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "dr21(oh ) is undetected in radio continuum emission and so is probably younger than dr21 .",
    "w75n , roughly 20  to the north of dr21 , comprises a group of embedded infrared sources @xcite , hii regions and compact radio sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as h@xmath0o and oh masers @xcite .    early work by @xcite and @xcite showed that dr21 and w75n coincide with two , possibly interacting molecular cores along a north - south molecular ridge extending over at least half a degree .",
    "these cores , evident in the more recent 850@xmath1 m  dust continuum maps of @xcite and @xcite , have been resolved into smaller clumps by various groups @xcite .",
    "spitzer images at 5.8 and 8.0@xmath1 m  reveal streamers of emitting material that seem to radiate away from the brighter infrared sources located along the molecular ridge @xcite , features possibly produced by ionization and ablation of the less dense material on either side of the ridge .",
    "@xcite also identify a number of `` extremely red objects '' , or eros , along the ridge .",
    "these are luminous , highly - reddened objects that may be very young , massive , early b - type sources .    in terms of outflows , dr21 and",
    "w75n have been studied independently by a number of groups .",
    "dr21 drives one of the most spectacular flows known @xcite .",
    "the bipolar outflow is extremely bright in h@xmath0 line emission @xcite and produces methanol abundance enhancements and masers through shocks @xcite .",
    "the dominant outflow from w75n is somewhat fainter in h@xmath0 , although it appears to be a good example of a wind - driven flow , in which sweeping bow shocks entrain ambient gas to form a massive molecular outflow @xcite .",
    "early co maps showing the orientation and bipolarity of the w75n outflow were presented by @xcite ; more detailed maps in co and millimetre continuum emission by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite illustrate the complexity of the region .    in this paper",
    "we discuss wfcam data obtained in h@xmath0 1 - 0s(1 ) emission and in the j , h and k bands .",
    "the images cover a 0.8@xmath2 0.8  `` tile '' ( see section 2 ) centred close to dr21 .",
    "the broad - band photometry are discussed in detail in a companion paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) ; in this work we focus on the h@xmath0 emission - line features associated with the many outflows along the dr21/w75n ridge . a comparison is also made with scuba 850@xmath1 m  data ( see also @xcite and @xcite for a similar map ) , and archival spitzer irac images at 3.6@xmath1 m , 4.5@xmath1 m , 5.8@xmath1 m  and 8.0@xmath1 m  ( originally presented by * ? ? ?",
    "the combined spitzer and scuba maps suggest that stars are forming within a flattened north - south filament viewed almost edge on .",
    "one of the goals of the wfcam observations was to search for outflows ejected east - west , i.e. perpendicular to this dense filament .",
    "we discuss the effect these outflows might have on the general gmc , and look for examples of collimated jets from the more massive ysos .",
    "there has been some disagreement on the distance to dr21 and w75n , although both are thought to be in the range 1.5 - 3.0  kpc @xcite . in paper",
    "ii we find that the upper limit gives a more realistic population of massive stars , so we adopt 3  kpc as a general distance in this paper .",
    "wide - field images of the dr21/w75 region were obtained during service observing at the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) on 6 may , 11 may and 9 june 2005 , using the near - ir wide - field camera wfcam @xcite .",
    "the camera employs four rockwell hawaii - ii ( hgcdte 2048x2048 ) arrays spaced by 94% in the focal plane .",
    "the pixel scale measures 0.40 .    to fill in the gaps between the arrays , and",
    "thereby observe a contiguous square field on the sky covering 0.75 square degrees ",
    "what is referred to as a wfcam `` tile ''  observations at four positions are required . at each position , to correct for bad pixels and array artifacts ,",
    "a five - point jitter pattern was executed ( with offsets of 3.2  or 6.4 ) ; to fully sample the seeing , at each jitter position , a 2x2 micro - stepped pattern was also used , with the array shifted by half a pixel . in this way",
    "20 frames were obtained at each of the four positions in the tile .",
    "data through _ mauna kea consortium _ broad - band j , h and k filters , and a narrow - band h@xmath0 1 - 0s(1 ) filter ( @xmath3@xmath1 m , @xmath4@xmath1 m ) , were obtained @xcite .",
    "exposure times of 5sec and 40sec were used with the broad and narrow - band filters , respectively . a correlated double sampling ( cds )",
    "readout mode was used with the broad - band filters , while a non - destructive readout ( ndr ) mode was employed with the longer - exposure h@xmath0 images .",
    "the latter yields a lower read noise ( @xmath520e- as compared to @xmath530e- with cds ) at the expense of greater amplifier glow and a higher risk of electronic pickup . with the 5-point jitter pattern and 2x2 micro - stepping in each broad - band filter ,",
    "the total on - source / per - pixel integration time was 100  sec per filter . in h@xmath0",
    "the whole 20-frame sequence was repeated ; hence , the total per - pixel exposure time was 1600sec .",
    "the data were reduced by the cambridge astronomical survey unit ( casu ) , which is a fore - runner to the vista data flow system project ( vdfs ) , a collaborative effort between the universities of london , cambridge and edinburgh in the u.k .",
    "casu is responsible for the design and implementation of the data processing pipeline used prior to the archiving and subsequent distribution of all wfcam data .",
    "the reduction steps are described in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "briefly , dark frames secured at the beginning of the night were subtracted from each target frame to remove bad pixels , amplifier glow , and reset anomalies from the raw frames .",
    "twilight flats were then used to flat - field the data .",
    "the micro - stepped frames were interleaved and the offset frames combined by weighted averaging ( using a confidence map derived largely from the flat - field frames ) to produce `` leavestack '' frames .",
    "astrometric calibration was achieved through a cubic radial fit and a six - parameter linear transformation to objects found in the 2mass point source catalogue @xcite .",
    "the transformation takes into account translation , scaling , rotation and shear .",
    "photometric calibration was also achieved through the use of 2mass data @xcite .",
    "all reduced wfcam data are archived at the wfcam science archive ( wsa ) , which is part of the wide field astronomy unit ( wfau ) hosted by the institute for astronomy at the royal observatory , edinburgh , u.k .",
    "( http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa/index.html ) .",
    "wsa data are distributed as rice - compressed multi - extension fits ( mef ) files .",
    "the data for one filter covering the 0.8@xmath6@xmath20.8@xmath6  tile appear as four leavestack files in the database , one mef file for each of the four offsets on sky needed to cover the tile .",
    "each leavestack file therefore contains four individual images , one for each of the four wfcam cameras .",
    "having retrieved the reduced data from the wfcam science archive ( wsa ) , starlink software were used to remove residual large - scale gradients across each of the 16 images in each tile .",
    "the starlink : kappa command surfit was used to fit a coarse surface to the background in each frame ; the four surface fit images in each corner of the full tile were median - averaged and used to flat - field the four associated target frames .",
    "the frames were subsequently mosaicked together using the kappa : wcsalign routine applied to the world coordinates assigned to each frame by the casu pipeline , together with the starlink : ccdpack mosaicking routine makemos .",
    "these gave one complete tile image in each filter .",
    "the spitzer space telescope images discussed in this paper were retrieved from the spitzer archive .",
    "our processing of these data is described in paper ii .",
    "the observations were obtained with the irac camera , which is described by @xcite .",
    "the data also appear in recent papers by @xcite and @xcite , although @xcite only give preliminary results , while @xcite focus only on a small @xmath52@xmath22field centred on w75n .",
    "the sub - millimetre data were obtained with the scuba bolometer array camera @xcite on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) on mauna kea , hawaii on four partial nights from may 26 to may 29 , 2001 in marginal sub - millimetre conditions ; the precipitable water vapor ( pwv ) was @xmath51.32  mm ( optical depth at 850@xmath1 m  @xmath50.250.36 ) , although it was fairly stable each night . due to the high pwv content in the atmosphere only the 850@xmath1 m  data were usable .",
    "the standard `` scan - mapping '' mode @xcite was employed with six different chop throws : 30 , 44 , and 68  in right ascension and declination respectively , while scanning in the nasmyth coordinate frame .",
    "each chop throw was repeated 24 times depending on airmass and sky opacity , the goal being to reach the same noise level in each dual beam map . the rms noise level in the final co - added dual beam maps was @xmath50.090.1 jy  beam@xmath7 .",
    "the pointing was checked frequently on the point source mwc  349 , and each dual beam map was corrected for any pointing drift between pointing observations .",
    "based on the pointing data the positional accuracy in the final 850@xmath1mimage is estimated to be @xmath81 .",
    "the maps were calibrated with scan maps of uranus as the primary flux calibrator and crl  2688 as the secondary calibrator .",
    "the flux calibration is estimated to be good to within 5% with respect to uranus .",
    "the telescope half power beam width was measured to be 15.2  from scan maps of uranus .",
    "the maps were reduced in a standard way using the starlink reduction packages surf and kappa @xcite , except that the individual dual beam maps where created by weighting the noise in each individual bolometer using the surf task _ setbolwt _ , which reduced the noise level in the maps by @xmath5510% .",
    "we then estimated the rms noise level using emission free areas in the maps and co - added the maps by accounting for the difference in noise between individual maps for the same chop throw and chop position angle .",
    "the final calibrated 850@xmath1mmap has a noise level of 5060  jy  beam@xmath7 over the whole area .",
    "for further analysis we divided the map into three areas ( south , middle , and north ) , removed the error beam using the miriad task clean @xcite and restored the maps to 14.0  resolution .",
    "below we present only photometry of the major 850@xmath1 m  cores , plus contour maps for comparison with the near- and mid - ir data .",

    "j , k and h@xmath0 mosaics were scaled by exposure time , filter bandpass and filter transmission before being registered and combined . in the resulting figures embedded sources can be easily distinguished from pure line - emission features , i.e. the h@xmath0 knots and bow shocks in jets and outflows . the former appear yellow while the latter are bright red in colour .",
    "some of the yellow features in the dr21 lobes are due to scattered continuum , while some may result from `` boosted '' k - band emission due perhaps to enhanced vibrational excitation by fluorescence @xcite .",

    "[ wfcam1 ] the molecular ridge that runs through the middle of dr21 is evident as a dark lane , largely devoid of point sources .",
    "we mark on fig .",
    "[ wfcam1 ] the `` extremely red objects '' , or eros , identified by @xcite , as well as the location of the dr21 a - b - c and d hii regions @xcite , and the dr21(oh ) cluster of water , oh and methanol masers @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ wfcam2 ] the hii regions a , b and c in w75n @xcite are labeled . in both figures",

    "dr21 is famous for its hii regions .",
    "it comprises four main radio emission peaks , originally labeled a , b , c and d @xcite .",
    "none of the radio peaks are detected in the near - ir @xcite , although the northern , compact source d is observed at mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "@xcite point to this source as being the dominant source of infrared luminosity in dr21 .",
    "they find that its total luminosity exceeds that of an o8 zams star and attribute the excess to accretion .",
    "they estimate an extinction of @xmath9  mag toward source d , and suggest that because it is still accreting , it could ( at least in part ) be responsible for the large - scale dr21 outflow .",
    "however , at radio wavelengths hii region d is cometary in appearance , opening outward toward the north @xcite .",
    "one could argue that a north - south flow is more likely . either way , there are no h@xmath0 knots or jet - like features close to this source which one might _ confidently _ associate with the hii region .    situated @xmath520  south of source d , radio sources a",
    ", b and c appear to be peaks in a larger `` bow shock '' or `` champagne flow '' style cometary nebula @xcite .",
    "this nebula lies @xmath515  to the east of the cluster of near - ir sources in dr21 , within the dark lane that separates the two lobes of the dr21 outflow .",
    "it is coincident with a dense molecular core ( see section 3.3 ) , although it has no mid - ir counterpart .",
    "overall , the cometary a - b - c nebula opens in the direction of the eastern lobe of the main dr21 outflow .",
    "this might suggest a causal relationship between the flow and the hii region .",
    "however , the more collimated , western lobe of the dr21 outflow is difficult to reconcile with the sharp , western edge of the cometary hii region",
    ". the powerful flow would surely disrupt this hii region / molecular cloud boundary , if the outflow central engine was situated _ within _ the cometary nebula .",
    "the complex of masers and mm - wave continuum peaks known as dr21(oh ) are found about 3  to the north of dr21 ( a - b - c - d ) .",
    "dr21(oh ) coincides with a chain of four water masers @xcite spread northeast - southwest over about 20 .",
    "orthogonal to the water masers , about a dozen methanol masers delineate the two lobes of the dr21(oh ) outflow @xcite .",
    "the water masers likely trace embedded young stars and ultra - compact hii regions , including in this case the outflow central engine , while the class i methanol masers probably trace the interaction between the outflow and the ambient medium .",
    "h@xmath0 line emission is also excited in such outflow - ambient impact zones , although we fail to detect clear evidence for h@xmath0 emission in our wfcam data .",
    "the absence of h@xmath0 emission in the dr21(oh ) outflow is likely due to extinction .",
    "w75n , shown in fig .",

    "the overall cluster harbours at least 30 ir sources with infrared excesses , probably due to circumstellar disks @xcite .    collectively , w75n is associated with a @xmath10m@xmath11  dense molecular core @xcite , which @xcite resolve into nine discrete millimetre continuum peaks spread over an area of about an arcminute .",
    "the brightest and most massive , mm  1 , peaks a few arcseconds to the northwest of irs1 and is associated with hii region w75n(b ) ; w75n(a ) is similarly associated with a continuum peak , mm  5 .",
    "mm  1 contains at least four hii regions ( a fifth is associated with mm  5 ) .",
    "three of these were detected at 1.3  mm with the vla by @xcite .",
    "of these , vla  1 drives a radio jet in the direction of the large - scale molecular outflow , although all three vla sources may drive independent flows @xcite .",
    "all three sources are associated with water maser emission @xcite ; vla  1 is also surrounded by a compact cluster of oh masers @xcite .",
    "each source is presumably in the protostellar phase , their radio fluxes being consistent with early b - type zams stars . indeed , @xcite assign spectral types of b0-b2 to all five hii regions , w75n(a ) being perhaps the most evolved at b0.5 .",
    "our h@xmath0 observations of w75n reveal not only the well - known h@xmath0 features associated with w75n itself , but also collimated jets to the north and west .",
    "lastly , roughly 15 - 20  to the west of dr21 there is a further region of active star formation that has to date attracted little attention .",
    "the region is evident in the spitzer data of @xcite , although they do not discuss these features in any detail .",
    "a search of the simbad database suggests that the region is situated on the eastern edge of the small l906 dark cloud .",
    "we find an abundance of h@xmath0 line emission knots and jets , plus regions of bright , nebulous , mid - ir emission and a number of highly reddened sources ( paper ii ) .",
    "we use the suffix l906e for the sources in this region .",
    "notably , no h@xmath0 flows were found in the diamond ring region ( fig .",

    "we do not discuss the main dr21 outflow , since this h@xmath0 flow has been studied in considerable detail in past papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in all we identify about 50 separate outflows",
    "although in previous sections we have identified and labeled the bright k - band/8.0@xmath1 m  sources , these are not necessarily the outflow sources .",
    "we have therefore used the spitzer irac images to identify young stellar objects ( ysos ) based on their spectral index .",
    "as mentioned earlier , @xmath16 is derived from linear fits to the observed flux density in each of the four irac bands .",
    "note that the more nebulous sources , like dr21-irs  1 and w75n - irs  1 , were not retrieved by our analysis technique ( described in paper ii ) and therefore have not been flagged as ysos .",
    "traditionally , ysos have been classified as class 0 , i , ii or class iii based on their bolometric temperature , infrared spectral slope ( measured between 2@xmath1 m  and 20@xmath1 m ) and the associated colour excess due to a dusty envelope @xcite .",
    "class 0 seds consist entirely of grey - body emission from the cool circumstellar envelope and are thus detectable only at mid- to far - infrared wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "class i , flat - spectrum , class ii and class iii ysos , detectable in the near - infrared , have photospheric seds with an infrared excess , the slope of which , @xmath16 , is positive for the younger ( class i ) sources .",
    "more recently , @xcite have applied this classification scheme to spitzer photometry of ysos in the low - mass star forming region ic  348 .",
    "they distinguish stars with optically thick circumstellar disks from their `` anemic '' counterparts , sources with heavily depleted , optically - thin disks or disks with large central holes .",
    "their thick - disk sources have seds measured from the irac bands of @xmath44 , while the anemic disk sources have shallower spectral slopes with @xmath45 .    in principle",
    ", irac colour - colour diagrams can also be used to distinguish yso classes @xcite . in the four irac bands",
    "centred at 3.6@xmath1 m , 4.5@xmath1 m , 5.8@xmath1 m  and 8.0@xmath1 m , class 0 and class i protostars have roughly the same colours ; [ 3.6]-[4.5]@xmath140.7 and [ 5.8]-[8.0]@xmath141.0 , indicative of mass accretion .",
    "class ii sources ( t  tauri stars ) overlap this region , roughly occupying a box with 0.0@xmath43[3.6]-[4.5]@xmath430.8 and 0.3@xmath43[5.8]-[8.0]@xmath431.1 .",
    "reddened class ii ysos have somewhat higher [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] colours , although slightly lower [ 5.8]-[8.0 ] colours .",
    "however , as we discuss in paper ii , there is considerable overlap in colour - colour space between the various yso classes .",
    "@xcite note that from spitzer colours alone it is possible to mis - identify reddened class ii sources or class ii sources with edge - on disks as class i sources .",
    "also , strong silicate absorption at 9.7@xmath1 m  and water - ice absorption features at 3@xmath1 m  and ( to a lesser extent ) 6@xmath1 m  may modify the spitzer colours of massive young stars , increasing [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] though reducing [ 5.8]-[8.0 ] @xcite .",
    "so although spitzer remains a powerful tool for distinguishing ysos from background and/or foreground field stars , particularly in high - extinction regions where near - ir data are of limited use , here we only identify sources with reddened photospheres , and distinguish protostars ( @xmath46 ) from pre - main - sequence objects ( @xmath47 ) .    in figs .",
    "[ h2jetsa ] to [ h2jetse ] we plot the positions of all of the ysos that were extracted from the spitzer images _ in all four irac bands _ , as reported in paper ii .",
    "we use circles to mark the protostars and triangles to indicate the remaining reddened photospheres .",
    "approximately 1600 sources were retrieved across the entire dr21/w75 field of which 165 were protostars and an additional 482 were pre - main - sequence objects ( we have only identified point sources with photometric errors of less than 0.05 mag at 8.0@xmath1 m ) .",
    "if we consider that some of the protostars will actually be class ii ysos viewed edge - on , then the yso population is reasonably consistent with an order - of - magnitude increase in the duration of the class ii phase over the class 0/i protostellar phase .",
    "the large - scale distribution and clustering of the ysos in dr21/w75 is discussed in paper ii .",
    "the k - band magnitudes , mid - ir magnitudes and spectral indices of the candidate outflow sources are given in table  [ sources ] .",
    "most are undetected at the shorter near - ir wavelengths ; three were undetected even at k ( fainter than @xmath519 ) .",
    "two of the brighter targets were saturated in our k - band data .",
    "the sources are assigned a letter in table  [ sources ] and in each of the figures in the appendix ( note that some sources have both an irs designation and an outflow source reference letter ) .",
    "in fig .  [ alpha ] we plot mid - ir spectral index , @xmath16 , against source magnitude at 8.0@xmath1 m  for all point sources in the dr21/w75 field detected in all four irac bands .",
    "the plot suggests a mild correlation between source magnitude and spectral index . in other words ,",
    "many of the bright 8.0@xmath1 m  sources appear to be embedded .",
    "the brighter 8.0@xmath1 m  sources are therefore probably luminous young stars .",
    "accurate luminosity estimates for individual sources are difficult to measure without photometry at longer wavelengths : note that the brightest sources were saturated in the mips images of this region @xcite , and that iras data lack sufficient spatial resolution to distinguish individual stars .",
    "even so , it seems safe to assume that the intermediate and high - mass sources correspond with the reddest 8.0@xmath1 m  sources in table  [ irs ] .",
    "= 8.0 cm    we find little evidence for h@xmath0 jets associated with the 8.0@xmath1m``irs '' sources ( see the appendix for a detailed discussion ) , and only one of the four eros has a definite h@xmath0 jet .",
    "most of the candidate jet sources in table  [ sources ] are relatively faint at 8.0@xmath1 m , while @xmath580% of the outflows listed in table  [ jets ] have no obvious source identified at 8.0@xmath1 m .",
    "it thus seems clear that , with the exception of the massive dr21 and w75n outflows themselves , the h@xmath0 jets are not driven by the massive protostars .",
    "instead , low- or at most intermediate - mass ysos seem to power each flow .",
    "the candidate outflow sources are , however , very red ( in comparison to the criteria used to select protostars from the spitzer observations ) .",
    "many will probably be class 0 or early class i sources",
    ". some may be flat - spectrum or class ii ysos viewed edge - on and therefore through their circumstellar disks , although if this were the case one would expect to see more class ii jet sources ( with negative values of @xmath16 ) viewed pole - on .",
    "it seems likely that many of the h@xmath0 flows are powered by low - mass `` protostars '' that are too faint and/or too heavily embedded to be detected even by spitzer .",
    "candidate central engines for the massive dr21 and w75n outflows remain elusive .",
    "accurate spitzer photometry of the irs sources in each region is difficult , since at near- and mid - ir wavelengths these sources are often extended and bathed in diffuse emission .",
    "the brighter sources are also saturated at the longer wavelengths . in dr21 ,",
    "@xcite note that uchii region dr21(d ) is detected in the spitzer bands and has an extremely red mid - ir sed .",
    "even so , it is not well placed mid - way between the extensive h@xmath0 flow lobes .",
    "also , it does not coincide with the brightest dust - continuum peak in our 850@xmath1 m  data .",
    "dr21(oh ) , on the other hand , _ is _ associated with a scuba core ; it is also detected at mid - ir wavelengths , and again is extremely red .",

    "[ h2jetsb ] ) , though dr21(oh ) itself is associated with multiple water masers @xcite and therefore probably comprises multiple sources , any one of which could drive the outflow .    the relationship between the infrared sources and multiple uchii regions in w75n are discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "the mid - ir properties of these sources are analysed by @xcite . from their analysis of ground - based and spitzer mid - ir photometry",

    "[ spit3 ] w74n - irs  1 is clearly elongated ; here @xcite identify two sources , one coincident with the near - ir w75n - irs  1 peak , and a second , much redder source coincident with the mm1 dust continuum peak @xcite and vla radio sources @xcite .",
    "this secondary mid - ir source is almost certainly associated with the w75n outflow source . its position , ra(2000):20@xmath3938@xmath4836.5@xmath49 dec(2000):42@xmath63733.6is also notably coincident , to within an arcsecond , with the `` w75n '' 850@xmath1 m  peak in table .",

    "both regions harbour a massive core containing clusters of hii regions , some of which are ultra - compact . both contain water , oh and methanol masers .",
    "both are also associated with bright , near- and mid - ir nebulosity and clusters of tens of embedded sources , many of which are b - type ( 510  m@xmath11 ) stars . both are also surrounded by smaller , more compact clusters of just a few ( or just one ) early b - type stars plus associated low - mass stars . dr21 and w75n themselves drive very massive molecular outflows , which are almost parallel on the sky ( as is the flow from dr21(oh ) ) . and finally , numerous smaller - scale h@xmath0 jets and outflows are found in the vicinity of each massive star - forming region , these jets being driven by low or at most intermediate - mass young stars .",

    "some of the long jets in table  [ jets ] , like b  6 - 1:b  6 - 3 and c  8 - 1:c  8 - 5 do have candidate sources with sed slopes consistent with very red ysos ( table  [ sources ] ) .",
    "precise jet opening angles ( @xmath51 ) are rather difficult to measure , particularly at kilo - parsec distances .",
    "the emitting flanks of large - scale bow shocks are often much wider than the underlying jet ( hh  212 is a spectacular example ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while changes in flow direction over time will increase the apparent flow opening angle . moreover , if one includes all features along the flow axis , or just the extent of the leading bow shock , very different values can be inferred .",
    "consequently , for a few flows in table  [ jets ] we list a range of values ; the smaller is measured between the candidate outflow source and the knot furthest from the source , while the larger value represents the maximum apparent flow opening angle that includes all emission features . if no yso is identified , the angles are measured between the two most distant knots in the jet .",
    "overall , the jets in the dr21 and w75n regions appear to have high degrees of collimation , consistent with the apparent youth of the candidate central engines in table  [ sources ] .",
    "flow position angles on the sky are also listed in table  [ jets ] .",
    "the two main dr21 and w75n outflows have almost the same position angle ( @xmath560@xmath6 - 70@xmath6 ) .",
    "the dr21(oh ) molecular outflow , which is not obviously traced in h@xmath0 , has a similar `` east - west '' position angle @xcite , as does the prominent h@xmath0 jet b  6 - 1 to b  6 - 3 .",
    "each of these flows is orientated roughly orthogonal to the chain of 850@xmath1 m  cores and the molecular ridge that runs north - south through dr21 towards w75n .",
    "if we simply count the number of flows in regions a and b ( including the main dr21 , dr21(oh ) and w75n outflows ) with position angles in the range 45@xmath6135@xmath6 and compare this to the number of flows with angles in the range 0@xmath645@xmath6  and 135@xmath6180@xmath6 , we find a ratio of 11 to 6 .",
    "( for the whole region imaged , the ratio is 25:10 . )",
    "moreover , a kolmogorov - smirnov test yields a probability of only 53% that the distribution of angles in areas a and b is homogeneously distributed between 0@xmath6  and 180@xmath6 .",
    "it is therefore possible that the flow position angles _ are _ to some degree dictated by the large - scale cloud morphology .",
    "if the north - south elongation of the dr21/w75 ridge is produced by gravitational collapse along east - west orientated magnetic fields lines , then the random motions of individual star forming cores within the ridge are only moderately successful at scrambling the polar axes of the outflow sources",
    ". this process may be even less effective with the very massive ysos , dr21 , w75n , ero  1 and dr21(oh ) , where the flows clearly are orthogonal to the north - south molecular ridge that extends through dr21 .",
    "note that @xcite find that the magnetic field direction , inferred from 850@xmath1 m  linear polarimetry observations , is orientated roughly orthogonal to the dr21 filament , as expected .      in busy star forming regions like dr21 and w75n , interactions between neighbouring stars as they pass by each other",
    "may inhibit disk formation , or even strip stars of their circumstellar disks .",
    "since accretion drives outflows , ysos without actively accreting disks will obviously not produce h@xmath0 jets . in figs .",
    "[ h2jetsa ] to [ h2jetse ] one can see that clusters of ysos do not generally coincide with an abundance of h@xmath0 features .",
    "although these areas are not entirely devoid of h@xmath0 jets , h@xmath0 features do seem to be more abundant in other regions , which show a paucity of ysos ( as identified by our spitzer analysis ) , e.g. the region @xmath51  northwest of the western dr21 outflow lobe ( figs .",
    "[ h2jetsa ] and [ h2jetsb ] ) and 35  west of the busy l906e - irs",
    "3/irs  4/irs  5 cluster ( figs .  [ h2jetse ] ) .",
    "a stellar density plot is shown in paper ii .",
    "to investigate this issue further , we consider whether outflow sources have fewer neighbours than ysos with no obvious h@xmath0 jet .",
    "to do this we count the number of neighbours each yso has within a radius of 50 pixels ( 20 , or 0.3pc ) .",
    "yso neighbours are classified as spitzer - identified protostars ( @xmath46 ) _ or _ pre - main - sequence stars ( @xmath52 ) , since all of these sources are likely to be in the same star forming regions and therefore potentially involved in star - star interactions or disk stripping .",
    "however , because all candidate outflow sources appear to possess reddened photospheres ( e.g. table  [ sources ] ) , we count neighbours only for the protostars .",
    "we have confined the analysis to a 8.0@xmath210.7  ( 1200@xmath21600 pixel ) region centred near dr21-irs  5 , a 8.0@xmath26.7  region centred on w75n , and a 8.0@xmath26.7  region centred midway between l906e - irs  3 and l906e - irs  6 .",
    "in other words , we focus only on regions where h@xmath0 outflows are abundant ( except for the region west of w75n , where we lack complete spitzer data and therefore source classifications ) .",
    "the resulting histograms are plotted in fig .",
    "the mean number of neighbours for candidate outflow sources is 1.4 , while the mean for the remaining protostars is 1.8 .",
    "both values are , however , skewed by the large number of sources with no neighbours ( the n@xmath530 column in fig .",
    "[ hist ] ) .",
    "many of these sources lie on the periphery of the north - south dr  21 ridge , and around the edges of the w75n and l906e cores .",
    "if we exclude the sources with no neighbours from the statistics , then the outflow sources have a mean of 2.0 neighbours , while the remaining ysos have a slightly higher mean of 2.9 neighbours .",
    "the latter is evident as a secondary peak in fig .",
    "the slight increase in the number of neighbours associated with non - outflow ysos is an extremely tentative result , not only because of the modest number of sources considered , but also because of uncertainties in identifying outflow source candidates .",
    "= 8.0 cm    at first sight it seems that very few ysos in the region drive _",
    "detectable _ h@xmath0 flows . by assuming that individual h@xmath0 knots are parts of extended flows",
    ", we identify only 53 h@xmath0 outflows in table  [ jets ] , while our analysis of the spitzer photometry reveals 165 protostars spread over the entire 0.8@xmath6  field . some of the class 0/i protostars will actually be pre - main - sequence class ii sources seen edge - on , and we do not include some of the very faintest knots and wisps of emission in table  [ jets ] .",
    "moreover , ( 1 ) the distance to dr  21 will limit our ability to detect some of the `` weaker '' flows , ( 2 ) extinction ( approaching 100 - 200 magnitudes at v in the densest cores ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will hide some h@xmath0 features , and ( 3 ) east - west orientated outflows will probably break out of the denser cloud regions and therefore not be particularly bright in h@xmath0 emission .",
    "even so , we conclude that we have detected  within a factor of a few  roughly the same number of h@xmath0 outflows as embedded protostars in dr21/w75 .",
    "supersonic turbulent energy in giant molecular clouds is expected to decay on timescales of a few million years @xcite .",
    "however , clouds last longer than this , harbouring multiple epochs of star formation at any one time .",
    "outflows may be responsible for the continued injection of turbulent energy in to molecular clouds , maintaining virial equilibrium and thereby limiting cloud collapse and the overall star - formation efficiency .",
    "the turbulent momentum ( and energy ) in a cloud is approximately equal to the product of the cloud mass and turbulent line width ( and line width squared ) .",
    "the mass of the cores associated with dr21/w75 have been estimated from modeling of dust continuum observations @xcite , molecular line maps @xcite and , more recently , as virial masses from extensive cs observations @xcite .",

    " @xmath59  m@xmath11  km s@xmath7   and turbulent energy in the range @xmath60 ",
    "@xmath61  j is inferred for each region .",
    "the momentum and energy supplied by an outflow from a young star vary with time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "younger flows ( from class 0 sources ) are more powerful than their class i and class ii counterparts , and therefore provide a larger momentum flux , @xmath62 , and energy flux ( or mechanical power ) , @xmath63 .",
    "@xcite note that one could use the canonical values for @xmath62 for class 0 and class i _ solar mass stars _ measured by @xcite to estimate",
    "the momentum supplied over the accreting lifetime of a young star .",
    "if @xmath64  m@xmath11 km s@xmath7  yr@xmath7 and @xmath65  m@xmath11 km s@xmath7  yr@xmath7 , then assuming durations of @xmath66 and @xmath67 years for the class 0 and class i stages , over its lifetime an outflow from a low - mass protostar should inject @xmath51.0  m@xmath11 km s@xmath7  of momentum into its surroundings .",
    "the outflow kinetic energy scales with the velocity ; since most of the molecular material in outflows is probably entrained in the relatively slow - moving wings of bow shocks ( which explains why co outflows are usually an order of magnitude slower than hh jets ) , then for a molecular flow velocity of @xmath520 km s@xmath7 , the kinetic energy supplied by a typical outflow would be @xmath68  j .",
    "the 50 or so flows from low - mass stars in dr21/w75 could therefore provide of the order of @xmath550  m@xmath11 km s@xmath7  of turbulent momentum and inject about 2@xmath69  j of kinetic energy into the cloud over their lifetimes .",
    "both values are less , by two to three orders of magnitude , than what is apparently needed to maintain the observed turbulent momentum and energy in the region .",
    "note also that the trend toward east - west orientated outflows noted earlier , and the small filling factor of each collimated jet ( with respect to the total volume of the cloud ) limits the efficiency of momentum and energy transport to the global gmc environment .",
    "but we have not considered the high - mass sources .",
    "although these are relatively few in number , their outflows are more massive and more energetic , by three to four orders of magnitude .",
    "the momentum in the dr21 and w75n outflows , measured from co observations , is of the order of @xmath70  m@xmath11 km s@xmath7  and @xmath71  m@xmath11 km s@xmath7 , respectively @xcite .",
    "this would be more than enough to provide turbulent support against cloud collapse , if this momentum was distributed throughout the cloud .",
    "but of course these two flows do not impinge on the whole cloud ; both are fairly well collimated and so probably efficiently `` drill '' through their molecular surroundings , rather than feed turbulence into the larger environment .",
    "note that massive dense cores , traced at 850@xmath1 m , remain around dr21 , dr21(oh ) and w75n ( fig .",
    "[ scu ] ) ; they are not entirely dispersed by the powerful outflows .",
    "finally , rather than use `` mean '' values for the momentum and energy of the outflows , we can infer these directly from the integrated h@xmath0 line fluxes , since the outflow mechanical power should be directly related to the energy radiated in the entraining shock fronts .",
    "@xcite point out that in strong - shock prompt entrainment scenarios , where the ambient gas is swept up in a momentum - conserving fashion to form the molecular `` co '' outflow , the energy radiated in the wings of the entraining bow shock  the flux seen in h@xmath0 and other coolants  should be equivalent to the mechanical power in the swept - up outflow . in regions",
    "a , b and c , the total h@xmath0 1 - 0s(1 ) line flux , @xmath72 , measured from the h@xmath0 flows identified in table  [ jets ] ( again not including the special case dr21 and w75n flows ) is about @xmath73  w  m@xmath15 . at a distance @xmath743  kpc , and assuming that the 1 - 0s(1 ) line represents 10% of all h@xmath0 line radiation , then the total h@xmath0 luminosity will be @xmath75  w. since there will be other important molecular coolants ; h@xmath0o , co , etc .",
    "@xcite , the energy radiated in the outflow bow shocks will actually be 2 - 3 times higher .",
    "the observed line fluxes are also not corrected for extinction .",
    "the observed jets probably occupy regions of fairly modest extinction ; an @xmath76 of 10 would boost the luminosity by a further factor of 2.5 .",
    "the total radiated power is therefore probably an order of magnitude higher , @xmath77  w. for a dynamical age of @xmath78  sec ( 1  pc/100 km s@xmath7 ) the energy pumped into the cloud equates to @xmath79  j , which again seems to be insufficient to account for the turbulent energy in the gmc .    in conclusion ,",
    "the _ current _ generation of low - mass yso flows probably does not drive the observed cloud turbulence .",
    "however , many repeats of the current epoch of outflow activity , possible during the few million year timescale for turbulent decay in the gmc , might provide sufficient momentum and energy .",
    "notably , the @xmath80  year outflow dynamical timescale is a factor of 10 - 100 times less than the turbulent decay time scale ( for a @xmath53  pc cloud and velocity of @xmath53  km s@xmath7 ) , as required .",
    "imaging surveys of other high - mass star forming regions are required to establish whether the abundance of outflows in dr21/w75 is common in other regions , or whether dr21/w75 is uniquely active .",
    "the former would support the occurance of repeat epochs of outflow activity in this and other regions .",
    "we compare near - ir and mid - ir images of the high - mass star forming regions dr21 and w75 , obtained with the wide - field camera , wfcam on the u.k . infrared telescope , and the irac camera on the spitzer space telescope .",
    "850@xmath1 m  images of much of the region , obtained with the scuba bolometer array on the james clerk maxwell telescope , are also considered .",
    "the h@xmath0 1 - 0s(1 ) images obtained with wfcam reveal numerous line - emission features , most of which appear to be associated with collimated flows .",
    "the spitzer irac images were found to be of limited use in tracing these outflows , because of the intense pah emission in the irac bands associated with background nebulosity , and because of limited spatial resolution in these very busy star - forming regions . however , the irac data were extremely useful for detecting ysos , particularly massive , embedded sources , and for identifying potential outflow central engines .",
    "the near- and mid - ir photometry and stellar population are discussed in paper ii .",
    "the conclusions reached in this paper ( paper i ) are described below .    1 .",
    "the well - known w75n and dr21 high - mass star forming regions are surrounded by smaller clusters that harbour perhaps just one intermediate or high - mass star ( the dr21-irs and w75n - irs sources ) . in the case of dr21 ,",
    "the scuba data reveal less evolved cores that are not generally associated with the `` irs - type '' clusters , although these cores may eventually evolve into such clusters .",
    "the fact that the scuba cores are already distributed along the dr21 ridge suggests that the cores are dynamically distributed throughout the region _ before _",
    "they evolve into intermediate or high - mass star forming clusters .",
    "as noted in paper ii , the more evolved yso population traced by spitzer is even more widely distributed .",
    "although we find a large number of h@xmath0 emission - line features , many of which appear to be associated with collimated jets , these are usually not associated with either the young scuba cores or the compact infrared clusters noted above .",
    "instead , they seem to be driven by independent protostars , probably low - mass class 0/i sources distributed around the periphery of the dense 850@xmath1 m  cores and north - south molecular ridge .",
    "h@xmath0 features associated with at least 50 individual outflows are identified .",
    "many are knotty and well collimated , much like jets in nearby low mass star forming regions .",
    "at least five are parsec - scale flows .",
    "the orientations of the flows on the sky show some degree of order , with two thirds of the flows being roughly perpendicular ( within a 90@xmath6  cone ) to the north - south molecular ridge ; we find only a 53% chance that the flows are randomly orientated .",
    "we find very tentative evidence that clustering may inhibit disk accretion and thus the production of extensive outflows .",
    "we certainly do not see an enhancement in the number of outflows around compact clusters or groups of embedded protostars .",
    "although the low - mass yso flows are abundant and widely distributed throughout the region , the observed outflow activity needs to be repeated 10 - 100 times if the flows are to provide sufficient momentum and kinetic energy to account for the turbulent motions in the large - scale molecular cloud .",
    "the current high - mass yso flows associated with dr21 and w75n _ are _ sufficiently energetic .",
    "however , because these massive flows are well collimated , orientated orthogonal to the clumpy gmc that runs through dr21/w75 , and because they are few in numbers , the transport of their momentum and energy to the ambient medium is probably relatively inefficient .",
    "the mid - ir and far - ir observations very effectively trace the distribution of protostars and pre - stellar cores across the entire region .",
    "the narrow - band h@xmath0 images complement these data by showing regions that are dynamically active , areas that may otherwise go unnoticed .",
    "together , the ukirt / wfcam , spitzer / irac and jcmt / scuba data yield a near - complete picture of star formation across the extensive region targeted here",
    ". similar wide - field studies in the future at modest to high spatial resolutions  particularly with the advent of scuba-2  should continue to improve our understanding of both low and high - mass star formation on global scales .",

    "subtraction of the diffuse continuum that envelopes w75n(a ) and ( b ) reveals a number of elongated h@xmath0 structures .",
    "these are thought to be bona fide line - emission features , since they are also recovered in the h@xmath0 images of @xcite and @xcite . the collimated structure c  2 - 1 and knot c  2 - 2 may be part of another collimated jet , although there is no bright k - band nor 8.0@xmath1 m  source along this axis .",
    "knots c  3 - 1 and c  3 - 3 may be bow shocks in the lobes of a bipolar jet , seen here as knotty feature c  3 - 2 .",

    "they identify a possible complex of multiple , overlapping , small - scale outflows in w75n .",
    "they also point out that the vla  1 jet lacks sufficient momentum to drive the large - scale co outflow , and conclude that multiple sources may be producing the flow .",
    "although our new near - ir images support the idea of multiple flows in w75n ( and its immediate surroundings ) , the data do not really shed any further light on this issue .",
    "area d , to the west of w75n , was not observed in all four irac bands .",
    "therefore , we can not use irac photometry to search for embedded ysos .",
    "even so , the region is of considerable interest .",
    "it includes a prominent bipolar molecular outflow labeled d  1 - 1 to d  1 - 8 .",
    "on morphological grounds alone it seems likely that features d  1 - 1:d  1 - 2 and d  1 - 8 represent bow shocks at the ends of bipolar flow lobes .",
    "midway between these features there is a compact cluster of at least three near - ir sources .",
    "two targets , w75n - irs  10 and 11 , are also 8.0@xmath1 m  point sources and are strong candidates for the outflow central engine ( see also fig .  [ spit3 ] ) .",
