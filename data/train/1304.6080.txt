    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ? * ) has revolutionized the concept of a galaxy . the sky coverage and depth of sdss enabled the discovery of low - luminosity , low - surface brightness galaxies . because their low surface brightnesses limit the distance out to which sdss can detect them , almost all of the new sdss dwarfs are satellites of the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "the most luminous of the new satellites , canes venatici  i , has an absolute magnitude of @xmath11 ( @xmath12 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which overlaps the lower luminosity bound of the previously known satellites .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the extremely low luminosities and stellar masses of these galaxies prompted @xcite to suggest a new definition of a galaxy to distinguish it from a star cluster .",
    "resolved stellar spectroscopy of all of the ultra - faint ( @xmath15 ) satellites known in @xcite revealed stellar velocity dispersions far in excess of the level that would be anticipated from their stellar masses alone ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , @xcite defined a galaxy as `` a gravitationally bound collection of stars whose properties can not be explained by a combination of baryons and newton s laws of gravity . ''",
    "the definition is phrased to include cosmologies involving dark matter or post - newtonian modifications to gravity .",
    "the definition also does not mandate _",
    "kinematic _ confirmation of dark matter - like phenomenology in order to classify a star system as a galaxy .",
    "evidence for the retention of supernova ejecta beyond what would be possible from the current baryonic mass alone can also suffice .",
    "a dispersion in heavy elements serves as proof of supernova self - enrichment and therefore as confirmation of a galaxy .",
    "the supernova self - enrichment test is important for the present work .",
    "the low stellar densities of the sdss ultra - faint dwarf galaxies make it difficult to detect them .",
    "these galaxies are near enough that their stellar populations are resolved .",
    "however , they contain so few stars that foreground stars and background unresolved galaxies outnumber the dwarf galaxy s own stars .",
    "the galaxy s stars are found instead by using matched filters , wherein only stars with appropriate colors and magnitudes are considered possible members @xcite .",
    "as sdss photometric catalogs became publicly available over the last decade , a flurry of new mw satellite galaxies were discovered using matched filters .    the first generation of sdss ( sdss - i ) has been exhausted as a discovery survey for new satellites .",
    "additional satellites may be found by deeper surveys or by surveys that target parts of the 75% of the sky that sdss - i did not observe .",
    "one such survey was the sloan extension for galactic understanding and evolution ( segue , * ? ? ? * ) , which was part of sdss - ii .",
    "segue discovered three additional satellites : the previously mentioned segue  1 , the ultra - faint galaxy segue  2 ( * ? ? ? * hereafter b09 ) , and the globular cluster segue  3 .",
    "segue  3 is known to be a globular cluster because it has neither kinematic evidence of dark matter nor a dispersion of metallicity @xcite .",
    "segue  2 is the subject of this article .",
    "@xcite discovered segue  2 ( also called the aries ultra - faint dwarf ) in segue imaging .",
    "they obtained spectroscopy and deeper imaging with the hectospec and megacam instruments on the mmt .",
    "they found that segue  2 has a luminosity of @xmath16 ( @xmath0 ) . from the individual radial velocities of five red giants",
    ", they measured a velocity dispersion of @xmath17  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the expected velocity dispersion in the absence of dark matter is 0.5  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "hence , segue  2 seemed to contain significantly more dark matter than luminous matter .",
    "@xcite also found tentative evidence for a stellar stream at the same position as segue  2 .",
    "it was detected as an overdensity of stars at the same radial velocity as segue  2 , but with larger metallicities than the gravitationally bound stars .",
    "the stream occupies a larger area of sky than the galaxy .",
    "the presence of the stream is exciting because it could be that segue  2 was deposited in the mw halo as a satellite or subcomponent of a larger galaxy that has been tidally disrupted .",
    "a similar origin has been proposed for stellar systems that may have arrived via the tidal dissolution of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one of the most interesting properties of segue  2 is its average metallicity .",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) obey a universal relationship between average stellar metallicity and luminosity or stellar mass @xcite .",
    "the relation predicts that a galaxy of segue  2 s luminosity should have @xmath18 } \\rangle = { -2.83}$ ] . from the coadded spectrum of five red clump giants ,",
    "@xcite determined their average metallicity to be @xmath18 } \\rangle = -2.0 \\pm 0.25 $ ] .",
    "other mw satellites about as faint as segue  2 also lie above the luminosity ",
    "metallicity relation ( lzr ) .",
    "segue  1 should have an average metallicity of @xmath18 } \\rangle = { -2.98}$ ] based on the lzr , but @xcite measured @xmath18 } \\rangle = -2.38 \\pm 0.37 $ ] , and @xcite measured @xmath18 } \\rangle = -2.03 \\pm 0.06 $ ] .",

    "it is important to measure metallicities for individual stars in segue  2 to test whether the average metallicity for a larger sample remains above the lzr .",
    "we observed stars in and around segue  2 in order to enlarge the available spectroscopic sample , to refine the velocity dispersion and metallicities , and to measure detailed abundances .",
    "the main purpose of our study is to suggest possible formation and evolution mechanisms for segue  2 .",

    "we placed ten slitmasks on and around the center of segue  2 .",
    "the slitmasks were contiguous on the sky .",
    "we selected targets from data release 7 of sdss @xcite by querying casjobs , the online database tool for sdss , for point sources classified as stars in the 30 around segue  2 . in the instances when slitmask design constraints forced a choice among multiple objects , we chose the object that lay closest in @xmath19 color to a yonsei - yale theoretical isochrone @xcite with an age of 14  gyr and @xmath20 } = -1.5 $ ] .",

    "therefore , we chose a central isochrone more metal - rich than the measured mean metallicity . in practice , the sample is almost entirely free of color or metallicity bias because the stellar density rarely forced a choice among multiple spectroscopic targets . in the cases",

    "the similarity of the chemical properties of ursa minor and segue  2 and the deviation from the lzr might indicate that segue  2 is the remnant of a galaxy that has been tidally stripped by the mw . in this scenario , stars would have been removed from segue  2 as it fell into the mw s gravitational potential . it would lose stellar mass and luminosity as it dissolved , but its stars chemical properties would not have changed .",
    "therefore , it would move to the left in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : trends ] .",
    "for example , suppose that segue  2 was a dsph identical to ursa minor before it fell into the mw .",
    "its initial luminosity would be @xmath219 @xcite . if it lost 99.7% of its stellar mass , it would appear as @xcite and we have observed segue  2",
    ".    tidal stripping of some dwarf galaxies certainly happens .",
    "it can be dramatic , as is the case for the sagittarius dsph .",
    "sagittarius has tidal tails that span the entire sky @xcite , and it likely deposited many of the mw halo s globular clusters in the process of dissolution @xcite .",
    "tidal stripping can also be subtle and result only in stellar overdensities with cold velocity dispersions @xcite .",
    "if the mw is tidally stripping segue  2 , then it falls into the latter category of subtle disruption , although @xcite suggested that segue  2 was deposited into the mw halo by a larger host , just as sagittarius has deposited globular clusters .",
    "@xcite showed from @xmath220-body simulations that the @xmath221 will increase as dwarf galaxies become tidally stripped .",
    "they assumed that the stars follow cored @xcite profiles and that the dark matter follows a cusped nfw @xcite profile . in this case , the galaxy would need to lose nearly all of its mass in both dark matter and stars in order to end up like segue  2 .",
    "more than 90% of the dark matter needs to be stripped before the stars are affected .",
    "in order to lose 99.7% of its stellar mass , the galaxy would have to lose @xmath222 of its dark matter @xcite .",
    "however , the dark matter subhalos of dwarf galaxies may not follow nfw cusps ( i.a .",

    "segue  2 may also have its own yet - undetected , low - surface brightness , low - metallicity tidal tails .",
    "the properties of segue  2 are mostly consistent with the tidal stripping scenario except that its half - light radius is very small .",
    "@xcite showed that intense tidal stripping of 99% to 99.9% of the stellar mass of a dsph decreases the surface brightness by a factor of @xmath223 , increases the mass - to - light ratio by a factor of @xmath224 , decreases the velocity dispersion by a factor of @xmath225 , and decreases the half - light radius by a factor of @xmath226 .",
    "all of these except the half - light radius are roughly consistent with transforming ursa minor into segue  2 via tidal stripping .",
    "the observed half - light radius of segue  2 ( 34  pc ) is a factor of 34 too small .",
    "however , @xcite considered only six models of dwarf satellite galaxies .",
    "a larger parameter space might include galaxies whose half - light radii are reduced enough to explain segue  2 within the tidal stripping scenario .    in the tidal disruption scenario , the upper limits on the dynamical quantities that we calculated from the upper limit on",
    "the velocity dispersion may be incorrect .",
    "the upper limit on the mass estimate assumed that the galaxy is in dynamical equilibrium and is supported by velocity dispersion .",
    "if segue  2 is instead an unbound tidal stream or loosely bound galaxy , then the mass estimate is unreliable . nonetheless , the upper limits for the dynamical quantities for segue  2 are consistent with the same relationships between dynamical quantities and luminosity or stellar mass as other dwarf galaxies ( figure  [ fig : trends ] ) .",
    "an alternative explanation for the chemical composition and low luminosity of segue  2 is that the stellar content of the galaxy is bound and largely unaffected by tidal stripping .",
    "instead , the galaxy formed only @xmath227 of stars over its entire lifetime . in this case",
    ", the comparatively high metallicity of the galaxy needs to be explained .",
    "segue  2 is not alone in lying above the lzr .",

    "the velocity distribution of its stars is irregular and non - gaussian @xcite",
    ". it may not be in dynamical equilibrium , and it could be a tidally stripped remnant , such as we proposed for segue  2 in section  [ sec : stripping ] .",
    "it is not practical to draw strong conclusions from only three galaxies that disobey the lzr .",
    "however , segue  1 , segue  2 , and willman  1 together invoke the suggestion of a metallicity floor for galaxy formation . @xcite",
    "first noticed that the ultra - faint galaxies lie slightly above the lzr .",
    "however , they used a metallicity indicator that has since been shown to be unreliable for very metal - poor stars .",
    "@xcite recomputed average metallicities based on lines , and they noticed a subtle change in the slope of the lzr around @xmath228 in the sense that the ultra - faint galaxies lay slightly above the lzr extrapolated from higher luminosities .",
    "there is a theoretical reason to expect a metallicity floor for galaxy formation .",
    "a single pair instability sn can bring the metallicity of the interstellar medium of a galaxy to about one thousandth of the solar value ( @xmath229 ) and mark the transition from population  iii to ii star formation @xcite .",
    "although one thousandth of the solar metallicity is not far from the metallicity floor that we observed ( @xmath20 } \\approx -2.5 $ ] ) , some dwarf galaxies have stars with metallicities a factor of ten below that floor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as @xcite  pointed out , the transition from population  iii to ii may not be reflected in a hard boundary in metallicity .",
    "but it could be reflected in a floor for the average metallicities of galaxies .",
    "damped lyman @xmath8 systems ( dlas ) at redshifts of @xmath230 , which are presumably nascent galaxies , do not exhibit metallicities below @xmath231 of the solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that galaxies do not form unless they achieve this threshold metallicity .",
    "however , dlas have much larger gas masses than the stellar mass of segue  2 .",
    "we reiterate that it is unwise to make much of the sparse sampling of the lzr at @xmath232",
    ". it would be wise to expand the sample sizes in segue  1 , segue  2 , and willman  1 before we conclude that the linearity of the lzr disappears below a few thousand @xmath233 .",
    "nonetheless , it is interesting to consider the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : trends ] together with the metallicity floor for dlas .",
    "the two models presented in the previous section for the origin of segue  2 s high metallicity given its luminosity have very different implications for our understanding of galaxy formation and cold dark matter ( cdm ) models . in this section ,",
    "we address segue  2 s place in the @xmath234cdm paradigm .    in section  [ sec :",

    "furthermore , we inferred from its retention of supernova ejecta that it was once hosted by a substantial dark matter halo .",
    "if so , then segue  2 is the first known galaxy to have shed its dark matter halo without being completely disrupted . to be consistent with a progenitor similar to ursa minor , which provides a good match for the average metallicity and abundance ratios , segue  2 would have once been hosted by a halo with a maximum circular velocity of @xmath235  km  s@xmath3 , corresponding to a virial mass of @xmath236 @xcite .    by number",
    ", such objects should be rare  but not extremely rare  in the mw at @xmath237 .",

    "* table  1 ) .",
    "however , most of these reside at large distances from their halo s center and have apocenter - to - pericenter ratios around @xmath238 , which is not conducive to strong tidal stripping .",
    "the ratio needed to achieve stripping of 99.7% of the stars ( to transform an ursa minor - like dsph into segue  2 ) would have to be about @xmath239 @xcite .",
    "only a small fraction of subhalos have orbital eccentricities that large .",
    "those subhalos would spend most of their lives at large galactocentric distances . as a result",
    ", galaxies similar to segue  2 would be difficult to detect , and segue  2 would likely be one of the closest such objects to the mw s center .",
    "furthermore , extremely tidally stripped galaxies likely would not survive their next 12 pericentric passages , which would make segue  2 a transient phenomenon that will survive for only 23  gyr .",
    "proper motion studies of segue  2 would be valuable in establishing whether its orbit is consistent with the tidal stripping hypothesis .    even in the absence of proper motions , the galactic coordinates ( @xmath240 , @xmath241 ) and galactocentric distance ( 41  kpc ) of segue  2",
    "exclude it from being a member of the mw s `` disk of satellites '' suggested by @xcite .",
    "the disk is @xmath242  kpc thick , and its pole points toward @xmath243 , @xmath244 .",
    "@xcite claimed that the existence of the plane was inconsistent with cdm structure formation .",
    "segue  2 s location does not invalidate the plane of satellites because many of the mw s satellites , including the most luminous satellites , do lie in the plane .",
    "however , segue  2 could not be a tidal dwarf galaxy that came from the merger event that @xcite proposed to explain the orientation of the plane - aligned satellites .    in section",
    "[ sec : floor ] , we presented an alternate scenario , wherein segue  2 is not a heavily - stripped remnant of a more massive galaxy but instead a relatively undisturbed dwarf galaxy whose properties indicate the existence of a metallicity floor in galaxy formation .",
    "the implications for @xmath234cdm galaxy formation in this scenario are very different from the tidal stripping scenario .",
    "segue  2 would have been born in a very low - mass dark matter halo of @xmath245  km  s@xmath3 . the mw is predicted to host at least 1000 such dark matter subhalos at present in cdm models @xcite .",
    "either segue  2 would be the first of a vast class of new galaxies to be discovered with very low luminosities and very low dark matter content , or it would have to represent a rare case of a dark matter halo that is typically too small to host a galaxy but , for some reason , managed to form a small number of stars over at least 100  myr .",
    "the presence of stars in a subhalo as small as @xmath246  km  s@xmath3 is especially remarkable because the threshold for atomic cooling to form stars is @xmath247  km  s@xmath3 @xcite . expressed in terms of virial temperature",
    ", segue  2 has @xmath248  k , whereas the atomic hydrogen cooling threshold is @xmath249  k. as a result , the gas in segue  2 would have had to undergo molecular ( h@xmath250 ) cooling in order to form stars . if the mass of the subhalo when it formed stars was as low as it is today , then segue  2 would be the only known galaxy that must have experienced only molecular cooling without atomic cooling .",
    "if segue  2 s dark matter halo has not been heavily affected by galactic tides , then its existence might provide an interesting constraint on warm dark matter ( wdm ) models because it has a low halo mass ( @xmath251  km  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "the formation of halos with @xmath252  km  s@xmath3 should be strongly suppressed for thermal wdm particles with @xmath253  kev @xcite , comparable to published lower limits based on the lyman  @xmath8 forest @xcite .",
    "the existence of galaxies in very low mass dark matter halos would favor models with significant small - scale power ( e.g. , cdm ) , and counts of such objects may provide the strongest lower limits on the thermal mass of dark matter particles @xcite .",
    "however , more work is needed to clarify the extent to which halo formation is suppressed below the associated filtering scale in the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered the segue  2 ultra - faint dwarf galaxy in segue photometry . from the line - of - sight stellar velocity dispersion measured with mmt / hectospec",
    ", they determined that its mass has a much larger fraction of dark matter than of stars .",
    "they also found evidence for a tidal stream at the same position and radial velocity as segue  2 .",
    "we observed segue  2 with ten keck / deimos slitmasks in order to enlarge the sample of radial velocities , refine the mass estimate , and add metallicity and detailed chemical abundances to the available data .",
    "we measured radial velocities by cross - correlation with template spectra , and we estimated velocity uncertainties by monte carlo resampling of the spectra based on a noise model of the full spectrum .",
    "we measured mg , si , ca , ti , and fe abundances by comparing the observed spectra to synthetic spectra using @xmath36 minimization .    with our threefold increase in spectroscopic sample size , we could not confirm @xcite s measurements of velocity dispersion ( @xmath254  km  s@xmath3 ) and mass ( @xmath255 ) .",
    "instead , we placed an upper limit on the stellar line - of - sight velocity dispersion of @xmath256 @xmath2  km  s@xmath3 with 90% ( 95% ) confidence .",
    "the inferred limit on the mass within the half - light radius is @xmath257 @xmath258 .",
    "we found a dispersion in [ fe / h ] and a decline of [ @xmath8/fe ] as a function of [ fe / h ] .",
    "these two chemical properties establish that segue  2 retained sn ejecta and that star formation lasted for at least several generations of type  ia sne ( at least 100  myr ) .",
    "we also determined that the average metallicity of segue  2 places it more metal - rich than the lzr defined by the more luminous mw satellite galaxies .",
    "the [ @xmath8/fe ] ratios as a function of metallicity are indistinguishable from the more luminous dsph ursa minor .    taken together , the dynamical and chemical characteristics of segue  2 point to two possible scenarios for its formation .",
    "segue  2 could be the barest remnant of a galaxy that once had a luminosity of @xmath259 .",
    "gravitational interaction with the mw s gravitational potential removed nearly all of of its stars and dark matter halo , leaving only the dense center of the galaxy . on the other hand ,",
    "segue  2 could have formed with its present stellar mass and metallicity .",
    "this scenario has been proposed for the ultra - faint galaxy segue  1 @xcite .",

    "on the other hand , sdss has revealed copious evidence of ongoing tidal stripping of satellites , and segue  2 may not have been immune to the same fate .",
    "the distinguishing characteristic of segue  2 is that the mw s tides have likely whittled it down to the least massive galaxy known .",
    "the tidal stripping scenario still needs to overcome the discrepancy between the half - light radius of models of tidally stripped dsphs @xcite and the observed half - light radius of segue  2 .",
    "it would be interesting to explore a larger parameter space of initial galaxy shapes ( such as the recent simulations of * ? ? ?",

    "these tiny galaxies and their relevance to dark matter physics make a compelling case for building high - resolution spectrographs for the next generation of extremely large telescopes .",
