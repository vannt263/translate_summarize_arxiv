    "[ f3b ]      the error bars quoted above correspond to our estimate of the uncertainty in the sum rules due to imprecision in our knowledge of the spectral functions . before proceeding let us describe how these were arrived at , and assess other sources of uncertainty .",
    "the data at lower values of @xmath46 are extremely well known , and they introduce very little uncertainty compared to other sources which we are concerned with . the high energy tail of @xmath111 is small above @xmath112  gev@xmath113 . in the @xmath21",
    "gev integrals , there remains essentially no sensitivity to this high energy tail once the constraints are imposed there occurs more sensitivity to the asymptotic tail , and it is the tail that describes the logarithmic running of the @xmath114 matrix element . while we have a good handle on the size of the @xmath115 component of the tail , we know little about the @xmath116 component .",
    "however as long as the @xmath116 portion is not much larger than the @xmath115 behavior for @xmath117  gev@xmath113 , its effect is within our quoted error bars . ] .",
    "it is in the matching of these two regions that one encounters the greatest uncertainties .",
    "fortunately , the four integral constraints described above are very stringent and allow us to limit the uncertainties in this region .",
    "we have used several methods to construct spectral functions which match the data within error bars and yet satisfy our sum rule constraints .",
    "these give variations in our integrals of under 6% .",
    "in addition , we have considered the situation where the asymptotic form of the spectral function is reached only on the average , with a damped oscillating term that provides deviations from the average . since our sum rules are equivalent to transforming back to euclidiean @xmath52 , these oscillations give exponentially suppressed effects at large @xmath90 once integrated .",
    "again the constraints are very powerful in further limiting this effect , and our studies lead us to increase the uncertainty in the fit to 10% to account for this form of variation .",
    "we also must account for the fact that the data and the input into the constraints are measured in a world where @xmath118 is not zero , yet we are interested in the result in the chiral limit .",
    "this introduces corrections of order @xmath119 which is of order 3% .",
    "in fact , since we know some of the physics involved in passing to the chiral limit , we could attempt to make a realistic correction for the extrapolation to the chiral limit . however , since this would appear to introduce some model dependence into our procedure , we prefer to simply include the uncertainty as an error bar . in practice ,",
    "the effect which has the most sensitivity for our results is the constraint of the pion electromagnetic mass difference , since the kernel @xmath120 bears the greatest resemblance to @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "work on the pion and kaon electromagnetic mass differences indicates that the quark mass corrections are somewhat larger than average .",
    "therefore , to be conservative we triple the canonical error estimate , leading us to quote a 9% uncertainty for the extrapolation to the chiral limit . we have added this in quadrature to the statistical uncertainty to arrive at the error bars cited above .      finally , we need to address the fact that it has become common to cite matrix elements at a scale @xmath23  gev , which is a rather low scale for perturbative qcd to be fully in the asymptotic region .",
    "in fact , our method can be used for any @xmath12 , and we can check if the asymptotic qcd behavior is obtained . for example , the renormalization group equations relate the @xmath12-dependence to the magnitudes of the operator matrix elements .",
    "although one of the relations ( eqs .",
    "( [ sd12]),([sp6 ] ) ) is automatically satisfied , we explicitly showed above that the second holds only if @xmath12 is large enough , _",
    "i.e. _ that it is well into the region where the asymptotic tail of the spectral functions becomes applicable .",
    "it is easy to see from the data alone that this is not the case at @xmath23  gev . another way to state",
    "the same result is that there remain power corrections in the sum rule , although the renormalization group states that the running with @xmath12 should be only logarithmic .",
    "we believe ( because of the generality of our framework ) that this issue must also be present in the lattice results , and we urge the evaluation of lattice matrix elements at larger values of @xmath12 .",
    "we do see such non - asymptotic behavior in our results . actually , for @xmath26 our method of cutting off the high frequency modes of the current - current product is in accord with wilson s original idea of the definition of a scale - dependent matrix element .",
    "therefore , our sum rule for @xmath56 can be treated as a _ definition _ of this amplitude at any scale @xmath12 , even if that scale is not yet asymptotic . for @xmath27 , however , there is some uncertainty as to an ideal definition in the non - asymptotic region .",
    "for example , the rg relation of eqs .",
    "( [ sd12]),([sp6 ] ) requires that we use exactly our definition , yet this only is foolproof if the rges are fully valid .",
    "equivalently , if this matrix element is defined via the coefficient of @xmath57 in the vacuum polarization , there can be order @xmath123 corrections remaining if one works in the non - asymptotic region .",
    "we see evidence of such power corrections .",
    "moreover , attempting to discard the @xmath123 effects leads to a larger matrix element . at @xmath110  gev ,",
    "the corrections are rather modest , in line with other uncertainties that we have described . however , at @xmath21  gev , these non - asymptotic effects represent a significant intrinsic uncertainty .",
    "_ we have taken these into account by combining two evaluations , one obtained by evaluating the sum rule at @xmath124  gev and using the rge to transform down to @xmath21  gev , and the other by direct evaluation of the sum rule at the lower scale .",
    "we average these two and assign the difference as an independent error bar . _",
    "the error bar is chosen such that a one - sigma variation reproduces the full range between the two methods of evaluation .",
    "we do this for both matrix elements .",
    "the quoted error bar at @xmath110  gev is scaled down from the @xmath21  gev values by a factor of four , as appropriate for quadratic power corrections .",
    "we now transform to the @xmath22 matrix elements .",
    "the results of our direct evaluation at @xmath21  gev leads to the matrix elements    & & _ 8 _ 2  gev^ ( ) = -(0.67 0.09)10 ^ -3  gev^6  , + & & _ 1 _ 2  gev^ ( ) = -(0.70 0.10)10 ^ -4  gev^6  , [ f4a ] where we have taken @xmath125 .",
