    "in the last two decades , the subject of nonlinear dynamical lattices has gained considerable attraction and interest due to its emergence and relevance to a wide range of diverse applications .",
    "these include , among others , arrays of nonlinear - optical waveguides @xcite , bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in periodic potentials @xcite , micromechanical cantilever arrays  @xcite , josephson - junction ladders @xcite , granular crystals of beads interacting through hertzian contacts  @xcite , layered antiferromagnetic crystals  @xcite , halide - bridged transition metal complexes  @xcite , and dynamical models of the dna double strand @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a specific phenomenon that has been intensely explored in a wide variety of recent studies is that of potentially asymmetric ( _ i.e_. , non - reciprocal ) wave propagation .",
    "this has been examined e.g. , in asymmetric phonon transmission through a nonlinear interface layer between two very dissimilar crystals @xcite .",
    "another example is the proposed thermal diode  @xcite which , in turn , led to its experimental realization  @xcite .",
    "the optical diode was theoretically suggested in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a setup of unidirectional transmission in photonics crystals ) and experimentally achieved in @xcite .",
    "such rectification effects have also been proposed in left - handed metamaterials  @xcite , granular crystals  @xcite and systems with gain - loss bearing so - called @xmath0-symmetry  @xcite , among others .    in the present work ,",
    "we focus on an , arguably simpler , implementation of the diode effect , which is fundamentally due to nonlinearity , as has been presented recently in the work of  @xcite . there",
    ", a linear chain was considered with a pair ( or more ) of nonlinear sites between the two linear ends of the chain .",
    "the nonlinear nature of the dynamics , coupled to a potential asymmetry between the characteristics of the nonlinear sites , was at the heart of the asymmetric propagation observed .",
    "the nonlinear sites were modeled as a prototypical system that has arisen in numerous applications , either as a direct model of relevance or as an envelope approximation in the form of the so - called discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation  @xcite . while structurally simple , this model incorporates the fundamental characteristics of such lattices , namely diffraction ( _ i.e_. , a discrete analogue of dispersion ) and nonlinearity . the scenario of  @xcite explores the standard cubic nonlinearity associated with the kerr effect  @xcite .",
    "however , often in applications , other types of nonlinearities are important as well . for instance , defocusing lithium niobate waveguide arrays exhibit a different type of nonlinearity , namely a saturable , defocusing one due to the photovoltaic effect @xcite . in the latter context , dark solitons have been identified not only in regular homogeneous lattices , but also in higher gaps  @xcite , as parts of multi - component soliton complexes ( such as dark - bright solitary waves )  @xcite , and even in heterogeneous chains with alternating couplings  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we combine the experimentally accessible form of the saturable nonlinearity with the asymmetric propagation nonlinear phenomenology of  @xcite .",
    "the model setup is presented in section ii .",
    "we consider in section iii exact plane wave solutions by solving the linear parts of the chain and gluing them through the nonlinear saturable `` defect '' sites . in this way",
    ", we identify the asymmetry between left and right transmittivities , due to the nonlinear propagation through the asymmetric dimer , trimer or more generally oligomer ( _ i.e_. , few site ) configuration .",
    "we explore the stability of these configurations and generically identify them as unstable .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the corresponding instabilities is explored through direct numerical simulations .",
    "finally , more realistic ( for experimental purposes ) wavepackets of a gaussian form are also considered in section iv and the manifestation of the asymmetry in propagation under such initial data is systematically quantified .",
    "section v summarizes our findings and presents our conclusions including some possible directions of future work .",
    "motivated by the above application of lithium niobate waveguide arrays , we consider a nonlinear schrdinger type chain with governing equation @xmath1 for @xmath2 and @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 plays the role of the ( spatial ) evolution variable .",
    "the saturable nonlinearity term is present in a finite region in the middle of the chain .",
    "that is , @xmath5 only for @xmath6 .",
    "the wave propagates freely _ i.e_. , linearly outside of the finite region containing the nonlinearity .",
    "the system is hamiltonian @xcite with @xmath7.\\ ] ] we will examine the transmission properties of stationary solutions that take the form of plane waves on the linear portions of the lattice .",
    "we also explore the linear stability analysis for these solutions and for a number of dynamically unstable scenarios , we evolve the corresponding solutions through direct numerical simulations over the propagation parameter @xmath4 . finally , we examine the propagation of more physically applicable localized gaussian wavepackets and summarize the corresponding transmission properties in connection to the corresponding ( potentially observable experimentally ) asymmetries .",

    "we truncate the lattice and refer to its finite length as @xmath44 .    for a solution that has been determined by the processes described above , we next compute the transmission coefficient @xmath45 explicitly assuming that @xmath10 is given . for this purpose",

    "i.e_. , encountering the region which is closer to linear is more conducive towards transmission , while encountering the more nonlinear sites at first is more prone to reflection , a feature that seems to be intuitively justified .",
    "in the present work , we considered a lattice setting where embedded in a linear schrdinger chain was a nonlinear `` segment '' of the saturable type .",
    "our analytical considerations were focused around plane waves enabling us to analytically compute both the transmittivity and the rectification factor between left- and right - propagating such waves .",
    "these features evidence the asymmetric nature of the propagation in a way that is analytically tractable .",
    "this asymmetry can be explicitly traced in the nonlinearity of the relevant setup .",
    "we also considered the spectral stability of such states in which we observe some effects of low versus high rates of instability .",
    "finally , we considered the asymmetry of propagation of a gaussian wavepacket .",
    "the latter was also clearly evidenced both in the case of a dimer , as well as in that of a trimer , paving the way for the experimental observation of relevant phenomena , such as the enhanced transmission of a wavepacket when encountering a region of increasing , rather than that of a decreasing nonlinear index profile .",
    "there are numerous aspects that may be worthwhile to further explore . in the context of lithium niobate waveguide arrays",
    ", it may be relevant to examine settings that involve a genuinely nonlinear lattice but with its central sites bearing a different nonlinearity than the background .",
    "this type of `` spatial profile '' of the nonlinearity coefficient has attracted considerable interest in numerous recent studies as evidenced by the review of  @xcite and may also be quite experimentally tractable .",
    "on the other hand , the vast majority of the present studies on the nonlinearity - induced asymmetry that we are aware of have focused chiefly on one - dimensional configurations .",
    "however , it would be both more numerically challenging and also theoretically intriguing to explore scattering of two - dimensional wavepackets from a central ( two - dimensional ) segment of a lattice which is genuinely nonlinear .",
    "such aspects are currently under investigation and will be reported in future publications .    finally , we should note that after submission of this manuscript , we were notified of a related work in  @xcite . while the models analyzed in these works are fairly similar , distinctive features of the present work are ( a ) that we explored systematically the stability of the extended waves and we studied the outcomes of their dynamical instabilities ; and ( b ) we also considered the effect of the incidence of a gaussian wave packet .",
    "lastly , ( c ) although the latter work is restricted to dimers , our considerations here have been provided for general @xmath152 and examined for @xmath153 .",
