    "the influence of a driven particle ( tracer ) on the steady - state properties of the medium within which it is moving has been a subject of considerable experimental and theoretical interest in recent years .",
    "driven tracers have been studied experimentally in a wide range of setups such as colloids dragged in dna solution  @xcite , spheres dragged in a polymer coil solution  @xcite or granular systems  @xcite , probe particles inside a colloidal crystal which locally melt the crystal  @xcite , or falling spheres in a fluid medium  @xcite . questions of interest are , for example , the steady state tracer velocity , the force - velocity relation , the local density distribution of the medium , the current induced by the tracer , and fluctuations of the tracer .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "various approaches have been applied for studying driven tracers .",
    "they range from deterministic continuum hydrodynamic equations to models with stochastic dynamics such as field - theoretic path - integral approaches for the study of tracer diffusion @xcite , random average processes which provide analytical results for the density profile  @xcite , and a variety of discrete lattice gas models  @xcite .",
    "the latter have proved rather useful for analyzing features such as density profiles , force - velocity relations , effect of geometrical constraints and fluctuations and correlations of the driven tracer .",
    "extensive studies of a tracer subjected to a constant force have been carried out within the framework of the simple symmetric exclusion process ( ssep ) . in these models",
    "the bath particles hop symmetrically on a lattice while the tracer is biased to preferentially hop in a particular direction .",
    "in addition , the bath particles may also undergo nonconserving adsorption - desorption processes .",
    "infinite 1d  @xcite , 2d  @xcite , 3d spaces  @xcite and even comb - like geometries  @xcite have been analyzed . in a similar setup a tracer moving with a constant velocity has been studied in 2d using an ising - like model @xcite . the case of an infinite one - dimensional line without absorption - desorption processes",
    "is a special case , where the particles stay ordered , so that the velocity of the tracer vanishes in the stationary state , asymptotically behaving like @xmath0 . in other cases ,",
    "in particular in higher dimensions , the stationary velocity of the tracer is finite  @xcite and has been found , without much surprise , to be linear with the force for small driving force .    beyond the force - velocity relation ,",
    "the ssep framework allows one to probe the full position distribution of the tracer  @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "it is shown that the position distribution converges to a gaussian distribution .",
    "its variance may however exhibit anomalous growth depending on the geometry  @xcite .",
    "in particular , for a quasi-1d narrow channel it has been shown that at large densities the position distribution of a tracer in a symmetric lattice gas converges to a gaussian with variance @xmath1 , a strongly superdiffusive behavior . in ref.@xcite",
    "this behavior has been linked to the covering properties of the random walk in this same geometry .",
    "the confinement indeed creates strong time correlations in the bath particles density field .    in the present work we study the steady state properties of a tracer moving in a narrow channel .",
    "the confined environment is expected to have a strong effect on the properties of the gas , as has already been shown in equilibrium  @xcite and out of equilibrium in problems involving one  @xcite or two particles  @xcite .",
    "our study is carried out using three different models : the first model is ssep , where the simplicity of the dynamics allows one to calculate the steady state density and pressure profiles along the channel .",
    "the profiles show a peak ahead of the tracer with a dip behind it , and the velocity of the tracer is found to depend on @xmath2 .",
    "we also use a method for measuring the pressure in lattice gas models  @xcite for calculating the local pressure at the boundary to obtain the pressure profile in the framework of the moving tracer .",
    "the model is then further simplified by introducing a corresponding one - dimensional ( 1d ) ssep type model where , to reproduce the effect of the rows parallel to the one of the tracer , overtakes between bath particles and the tracer are allowed .",
    "this model is simpler to analyze and its steady state density profile is exactly calculable in some limit .",
    "the results obtained for the 1d model are readily compared with the ones of the 2d channel . in the third approach",
    "we consider a molecular dynamics model of overdamped hard disks ( hd ) in a narrow 2d channel .",
    "we show that the density profile and the velocity of the tracer in the hard disks model can be predicted to some extent using the results of the previous section for the 1d ssep with overtakes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section:2dssep ]",
    "we study the 2d ssep model .",
    "we present analytical predictions from the discrete equations as well as from a simpler continuous equation and compare them to numerical results for the density field and the pressure .",
    "we then turn to the 1d ssep with overtakes in section  [ section:1dssep ] . for this model",
    "approximate expressions for the current and the density profile are obtained . in section  [ section : harddisks ]",
    "the hd model is considered , and we show that a correspondence can be made between this more complicated model and the 1d ssep . section  [ section : sum ] summarizes and concludes the paper .",
    "we start with studying the system drawn in fig.[fig : system ] .",
    "we consider a two dimensional square lattice of length @xmath3 in the @xmath4 direction and @xmath2 in the @xmath5 direction .",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath4 direction and reflecting ones in the @xmath5 direction . in the _ lattice frame _ sites",

    "i.e. _ the maximum number of particles on each site is @xmath11 .",
    "the model evolves by random sequential dynamics , so that time is continuous .",
    "bath particles attempt to hop in each of the four directions with rate @xmath11 .",
    "their move is accepted if and only if their target site is empty .",
    "the bath particles are simply ssep particles and would reach an equilibrium state with uniform distribution if there were no tracer .    in the most general case , the tracer would be allowed to move towards the four directions of space with different probabilities that depend on the force applied . in the present study",
    "we simplify the dynamics and allow the tracer to hop only in the @xmath4 direction keeping its @xmath5 coordinate fixed .",
    "we therefore allow the tracer to attempt to hop only in the @xmath14 direction with rate @xmath15 and in the @xmath16 direction with rate @xmath17 .",

    "the extra site is in a position to measure the pressure at a distance @xmath23 from the tracer.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]        we begin by writing an equation for the density field in the frame of the tracer .",
    "a closed equation is obtained by factorizing the two - point correlations .",
    "the equation obtained here is a particular case of eqs.(13)-(14 ) in ref.@xcite on the full 2d plane .",
    "here we however propose a different , somewhat shorter derivation and we apply it to the narrow channel geometry .",
    "we denote positions in the frame of the tracer by @xmath24 , with @xmath25 in this frame the tracer is fixed at position @xmath26 .",
    "let us now define the occupation variables @xmath27 , that are @xmath28 for an empty site and @xmath11 for a site occupied by a bath particle , and write an equation for their evolution in time .",

    "<S> steady state properties of a driven tracer moving in a narrow two dimensional ( 2d ) channel of quiescent medium are studied . </S>",
    "<S> the tracer drives the system out of equilibrium , perturbs the density and pressure fields , and gives the bath particles a nonzero average velocity , creating a current in the channel . </S>",
    "<S> three models in which the confining effect of the channel is probed are analyzed and compared in this study : the first is the simple symmetric exclusion process ( ssep ) , for which the stationary density profile and the pressure on the walls in the frame of the tracer are computed . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the tracer acts like a dipolar source in an average velocity field . the spatial structure of this 2d strip </S>",
    "<S> is then simplified to a one dimensional ssep , in which exchanges of position between the tracer and the bath particles are allowed . using a combination of mean field theory and exact solution in the limit where no exchange is allowed , </S>",
    "<S> gives good predictions of the velocity of the tracer and the density field . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that results obtained for the 1d ssep with exchanges also apply to a gas of overdamped hard disks in a narrow channel . the correspondence between the parameters of the ssep and of the gas of hard disks is systematic and follows from simple intuitive arguments . </S>",
    "<S> our analytical results are checked numerically . </S>"
