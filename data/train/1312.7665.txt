    "a similar magnetisation configuration has been predicted and observed in other works for the case of two - dimensional systems in the presence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy where it is called either the quasi - ferromagnetic  @xcite or edged vortex state  @xcite . because the isk equilibrium state clearly differs from the ferromagnetic configuration and using the word vortex implies the topological charge of @xmath24",

    "<S> magnetic skyrmions have the potential to provide solutions for low - power , high - density data storage and processing . </S>",
    "<S> one of the major challenges in developing skyrmion - based devices is the skyrmions magnetic stability in confined helimagnetic nanostructures . through a systematic study of equilibrium states , using a full three - dimensional micromagnetic model including demagnetisation effects , we demonstrate that skyrmionic textures are the lowest energy states in helimagnetic thin film nanostructures at zero external magnetic field and in absence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> we also report the regions of metastability for non - ground state equilibrium configurations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that bistable skyrmionic textures undergo hysteretic behaviour between two energetically equivalent skyrmionic states with different core orientation , even in absence of both magnetocrystalline and demagnetisation - based shape anisotropies , suggesting the existence of dzyaloshinskii - moriya - based shape anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that the skyrmionic texture core reversal dynamics is facilitated by the bloch point occurrence and propagation .    </S>",
    "<S> an ever increasing need for data storage creates great challenges for the development of high - capacity storage devices that are cheap , fast , reliable , and robust . </S>",
    "<S> nowadays , hard disk drive technology uses magnetic grains pointing up or down to encode binary data ( 0 or 1 ) in so - called perpendicular recording media . </S>",
    "<S> practical limitations are well understood and dubbed the `` magnetic recording trilemma ''  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it defines a trade - off between three conflicting requirements : signal - to - noise ratio , thermal stability of the stored data , and the ability to imprint information . because of these fundamental constraints , further progress requires radically different approaches .    </S>",
    "<S> recent research demonstrated that topologically stable magnetic skyrmions have the potential for the development of future data storage and information processing devices . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , a skyrmion lattice formed in a monoatomic fe layer grown on a ir(111 ) surface  @xcite revealed skyrmions with diameters as small as a few atom spacings . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it has been demonstrated that skyrmions can be easily manipulated using spin - polarised currents of the @xmath0 order  @xcite which is a factor @xmath1 to @xmath2 smaller than the current densities required in conventional magneto - electronics . </S>",
    "<S> these unique skyrmion properties point to an opportunity for the realisation of ambitious novel high - density , power - efficient storage  @xcite and logic  @xcite devices .    </S>",
    "<S> skyrmionic textures emerge as a consequence of chiral interactions , also called the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions ( dmi ) , that appear when there is no inversion symmetry in the magnetic system structure </S>",
    "<S> . the lack of inversion symmetry can be either due to a non - centrosymmetric crystal lattice structure  @xcite in so - called helimagnetic materials , or at interfaces between different materials that inherently lack inversion symmetry  @xcite . according to this </S>",
    "<S> , the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction can be classified either as bulk or interfacial , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> skyrmions , after being predicted  @xcite , were later experimentally observed in magnetic systems with both bulk  @xcite and interfacial  @xcite types of dmi .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , a major challenge obstructing the development of skyrmion - based devices has been their thermal and magnetic stability  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> only recently , skyrmions were observed at the room temperature in magnetic systems with bulk  @xcite and interfacial  @xcite dmi . </S>",
    "<S> however , the magnetic stability of skyrmions in absence of external magnetic field was reported only for magnetic systems with interfacial dmi in one - atom layer thin films  @xcite , where the skyrmion state is stabilised in the presence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy .    </S>",
    "<S> the focus of this work is on the zero - field stability of skyrmionic textures in confined geometries of bulk dmi materials . </S>",
    "<S> zero - field stability is a crucial requirement for the development of skyrmion - based devices : devices that require external magnetic fields to be stabilised are volatile , harder to engineer and consume more energy . </S>",
    "<S> we address the following questions that are relevant for the skyrmion - based data storage and processing nanotechnology . </S>",
    "<S> can skyrmionic textures be the ground state ( i.e.  have the lowest energy ) in helimagnetic materials at zero external magnetic field , and if they can , what is the mechanism responsible for this stability ? </S>",
    "<S> do the demagnetisation energy and magnetisation variation along the out - of - film direction  @xcite have important contribution to the stability of skyrmionic textures ? is the magnetocrystalline anisotropy an essential stabilisation mechanism ? </S>",
    "<S> are there any other equilibrium states that emerge in confined helimagnetic nanostructures ? </S>",
    "<S> how robust are skyrmionic textures against varying geometry ? </S>",
    "<S> do skyrmionic textures undergo hysteretic behaviour in the presence of an external magnetic field ( crucial for data imprint ) , and if they do , what is the skyrmionic texture reversal mechanism ?    to resolve these unknowns , we use a full three - dimensional simulation model that makes no assumption about translational invariance of magnetisation in the out - of - film direction and takes full account of the demagnetisation energy . we demonstrate , using this full model , that dmi - induced skyrmionic textures in confined thin film helimagnetic nanostructures are the lowest energy states in the absence of both the stabilising external magnetic field and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and are able to adapt their size to hosting nanostructures , providing the robustness for their practical use . we demonstrate that both the demagnetisation energy and the magnetisation variation in the out - of - film direction play an important role for the stability of skyrmionic textures . in addition , we report the parameter space regions where other magnetisation configurations are in equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we demonstrate that these zero - field stable skyrmionic textures undergo hysteretic behaviour when their core orientation is changed using an external magnetic field , which is crucial for data imprint . the hysteretic behaviour remains present even in the absence of all relevant magnetic anisotropies ( magnetocrystalline and demagnetisation - based shape anisotropies ) , suggesting the existence of a novel dzyaloshinskii - moriya - based shape anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude the study by showing that the skyrmionic texture core orientation reversal is facilitated by the bloch point occurrence and propagation , where the bloch point may propagate in either of the two possible directions . </S>",
    "<S> this work is based on the specific cubic helimagnetic material , fege with @xmath3 helical period , in order to encourage the experimental verification of our predictions . </S>",
    "<S> other materials could allow either to reduce the helical period  @xcite and therefore the hosting nanostructure size or increase the operating temperature  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> some stability properties of dmi - induced isolated skyrmions in two - dimensional confined systems have been studied analytically  @xcite and using simulations  @xcite . however , in all these studies , either magnetocrystalline anisotropy or an external magnetic field ( or both ) are crucial for the stabilisation of skyrmionic textures . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , an alternative approach to the similar problem , in absence of chiral interactions , where skyrmionic textures can be stabilised at zero external magnetic field and at room temperature using a strong perpendicular anisotropy , has been studied analytically  @xcite , experimentally  @xcite , as well as using simulations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our new results , and in particular the zero - field skyrmionic ground state in isotropic helimagnetic materials , can only be obtained by allowing the chiral modulation of magnetisation direction along the film normal , which has recently been shown to radically change the skyrmion energetics  @xcite . </S>"
