    "wave propagation in periodic layered media is very similar to the motion of electrons in crystallyne solids ( hence , they are also known as photonic crystals ) .",
    "thus , it is hardly surprising that some well - established concepts of solid - state physics ( such as bloch waves , brillouin zones , and forbidden bands ) have been incorporated in the doctrine of photonic crystals  @xcite .",
    "the standard approach  @xcite identifies the periodic structure with a one - dimensional lattice that is invariant under lattice translations , which requires the system to be strictly infinite .",
    "of course , this is unattainable in practice . in solid - state physics",
    "one goes around this difficulty by considering that the one - dimensional lattice closes into a ring ; i.e. , by imposing periodic boundary conditions . while this seems to be reasonable for a lattice of atoms , is obviously unfeasible for periodically stratified media .    in spite of this fact , only under the assumption of an endlessly repeating stack of dielectric slabs this standard treatment gets an eigenvalue equation for the bloch factor and",
    "then one finds  @xcite that strong reflection ( stop bands ) occurs when the trace of the @xmath0 matrix describing the basic period exceeds 2 in magnitude .    in practice",
    "not very many periods ( say , ten ) are needed to have a stop band .",
    "therefore , one is led to consider stacks of @xmath1 periods , which are often appropriately called ",
    "finite \" periodic structures  @xcite .",
    "the matrix describing these structures can be computed as the @xmath1th power of the basic period in terms of chebyshev polynomials  @xcite .",
    "this gives an exact expression for the reflectance , but so complicated that it is difficult to get , at first glance , any feeling about the performance of the system .",
    "moreover , the distinction between allowed and forbidden bands is obtained only numerically .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide an alternative setting for dealing with these finite periodic structures that stresses the different scaling laws appearing in the reflectance . to this end",
    "we resort to the iwasawa decomposition to represent the action of any multilayer as the product of three fundamental matrices of simple interpretation .",
    "we show that these matrices present quite distinct reflectances .",
    "the trace of the basic period allows us to classify periodic structures in three types with properties closely related to one ( and only one ) of the three fundamental matrices . finally , we study the reflectance associated to each one of these types .",
    "the advantage of this approach is , in our view , twofold : it naturally emphasizes the different laws for the forbidden bands , allowed bands , and band edges and , at the same time , provides universal expressions remarkably simple for the corresponding reflectances .",
    "to keep the discussion as self - contained as possible , we first briefly summarize the essential ingredients of multilayer optics that we shall need for our purposes .",
    "the basic period of the structure is illustrated in fig .  1 and consists of a stack of @xmath2 plane - parallel layers sandwiched between two semi - infinite ambient ( @xmath3 ) and substrate ( @xmath4 ) media , which we shall assume to be identical , since this is the common experimental case .",
    "hereafter all the media are supposed to be lossless , homogeneous , and isotropic .",
    "we consider an incident monochromatic linearly polarized plane wave from the ambient that makes an angle @xmath5 with the normal to the first interface and has amplitude @xmath6 .",
    "the electric field is either in the plane of incidence ( @xmath7 polarization ) or perpendicular to the plane of incidence ( @xmath4 polarization ) .",
    "we consider as well another plane wave of the same frequency and polarization , and with amplitude @xmath8 , incident from the substrate at the same angle @xmath9 .    as a result of multiple reflections in all the interfaces  @xcite",
    ", we have a backward - traveling plane wave in the ambient , denoted @xmath10 , and a forward - traveling plane wave in the substrate , denoted @xmath11 . if we take the field amplitudes as a vector of the form @xmath12 which applies to both ambient and substrate media , then the amplitudes at each side of the multilayer are related by the @xmath0 complex matrix @xmath13 , we shall call the transfer matrix , in the form @xmath14 the matrix @xmath13 can be shown to be of the form  @xcite @xmath15 where the complex numbers @xmath16 are , respectively , the overall reflection and transmission coefficients for a wave incident from the ambient .",
    "note that we have @xmath17 , which is equivalent to @xmath18 , and then the set of lossless multilayer matrices reduces to the group su(1,1 ) , whose elements depend on three independent real parameters  @xcite .",
    "the identity matrix corresponds to @xmath19 and @xmath20 , so it represents an antireflection system without transmission phase shift .",
    "the matrix that describes the overall system obtained by putting two multilayers together is the product of the matrices representing each one of them , taken in the appropriate order .",
    "so , two multilayers , which are inverse , when composed give an antireflection system .",
    "when we repeat the basic period @xmath13 the fields at the @xmath21th cell are given by @xmath22 in an infinite structure the floquet theorem ensures that these cells are equivalent and so the two vectors in eq .",
    "( [ fixed ] ) are proportional  @xcite @xmath23 and therefore the bloch factor @xmath24 is determined as the eigenvalue of the basic - period transfer matrix @xmath13 : @xmath25 which gives @xmath26 \\lambda   + 1 = 0 .\\ ] ] if @xmath27 ^ 2 > 4 $ ] , the solution grows or decays exponentially and no propagating wave is possible ( stop band ) . on the contrary ,",
    "bloch waves appear in this algebraic approach when @xmath28 ^ 2 < 4 $ ] and then the matrix @xmath29 has two eigenvalues ( allowed band ) .",
    "the band edges are obtained by setting @xmath27 ^ 2 = 4 $ ] .",
    "such a periodic structure exhibits resonance reflection very much like the diffraction of x rays by crystal lattice planes and , in consequence , it is usually called a bragg reflector  @xcite . by properly designing the basic period it is possible to achieve extremely high reflectance for some selected spectral region  @xcite .",
    "as anticipated in the introduction , an infinite multilayer is unrealistic in practice , and one should consider @xmath1-period finite structures , for which the previous standard approach fails  @xcite .",
    "the overall transfer matrix @xmath30 for a @xmath1-period structure is equal to @xmath31 .",
    "explicit but complicated formulas for the corresponding matrix elements exist  @xcite , but they do not give analytic expressions for the bandgap and are difficult to analyze .",
    "we have recently advocated using the iwasawa decomposition to study layered media  @xcite , since it provides a remarkable factorization of the matrix representing any multilayer ( no matter how complicated it could be ) as the product of three matrices of simple interpretation .",
    "the decomposition can be stated as @xmath32 where @xmath33 the parameters @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are given in terms of the elements of the multilayer matrix by @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "now , we can interpret the physical action of the matrices appearing in eq .",
    "( [ iwa1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath38 represents the free propagation of the fields @xmath39 in the ambient medium through an optical phase thickness of @xmath40 , which reduces to a mere shift of the origin of phases .",
    "alternatively , this can be seen as an antireflection system .",
    "the second matrix @xmath41 represents a symmetric system with real transmission coefficient @xmath42 and reflection phase shift @xmath43 finally , the third matrix , @xmath44 , represents a system having @xmath45 and @xmath46 , with @xmath47 . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have provided simple examples of realistic systems that accomplish these requirements .    for our purposes here ,",

    "however , they have distinct growth : @xmath51 goes to unity exponentially , while @xmath52 goes as @xmath54 .",
    "the iwasawa decomposition proves also to be a powerful tool for the classification of layered media . indeed , after ref .",

    "although this trace criterion has an elegant geometrical interpretation  @xcite and coincides with the one giving the stop bands in eq .",
    "( [ eig ] ) , let us remark that if a multilayer has a transfer matrix @xmath13 of type @xmath55 , @xmath57 , or @xmath59 , one can always find a family of matrices @xmath61 [ also in su(1,1 ) ] such that @xmath62 is just a matrix @xmath38 , @xmath41 , or @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "this conjugation by @xmath61 preserves the trace : @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , eq .  ( [ mconj ] ) allows us to recast the multilayer action in eq .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) as @xmath64 where the new field vectors are @xmath65 in other words , the matrix @xmath61 gives a new vector basis such that the basic period of the system , when viewed in such a basis , presents a reflectance exactly of the form in eq .",
    "( [ refkan ] ) .",
    "this provides a full characterization of the reflectance of any periodic system , as we shall demonstrate in next section .",
    "since the matrix @xmath66 associated to the basic period belongs to one of the subgroups @xmath38 , @xmath67 , or @xmath68 of the iwasawa decomposition , and all these subgroups are , in our special case , abelian and uniparametric , we have that @xmath69 where @xmath70 represents the appropriate parameter @xmath71 , @xmath53 , or @xmath35 . for a @xmath1-period system",
