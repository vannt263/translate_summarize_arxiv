    "galaxy clusters , the largest gravitationally bound systems in the universe , are believed to be the youngest physical structures , only recently dissociated from the hubble expansion .",
    "they serve as powerful probes of cosmology and large scale structure formation because they retain a `` memory '' of their assembly history .",
    "especially , many known high - redshift clusters at @xmath11 show snapshots of their early stage of formation when the universe was at approximately half its present age . detailed studies of these distant , still - forming clusters can considerably enhance our understanding of the dynamical evolution of the cluster substructure .",
    "clusters of galaxies are composed of three major components : visible galaxies , a hot intracluster medium ( icm ) , and dark matter .",
    "the advent of high - resolution x - ray observatories have enabled remarkable progress in tracing the complicated thermodynamical structure of the icm of a galaxy cluster , whereas weak - lensing particularly empowered by the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 ( hst ) high - resolution observations is starting to yield a detailed distribution of dark matter . and",
    "extensive spectroscopic surveys of cluster fields by ground - based facilities with large aperture telescopes provide invaluable information on the distribution of the member galaxies as well as the kinematics of the cluster .",
    "weak - lensing analysis can provide the most direct measurement of the cluster mass distribution without any assumption about the dynamical phase of the cluster .",
    "however , under the simplified hypothesis that the cluster is in quasi - equilibrium , both the kinematics and the x - ray analyses can also independently be used to derive the mass properties of the target cluster .",
    "a joint analysis of weak - lensing and x - ray measurements is a unique opportunity to investigate the interplay between the icm and dark matter within the cluster . because of their different natures",
    ", it is expected that these two components have somewhat dissimilar distributions within the cluster .",
    "the icm , due to its collisional property , is subject to ram pressure , and shocks can be detected between merging sub - clusters where the transverse velocities exceed the sound speed . in addition , the frequent collisions between gas particles should evolve the system into a high degree of virialization on a relatively short time scale . on the other hand , cold dark",
    "matter , due to its hypothesized collisionless nature , is often believed to be traced by the cluster galaxies whose approximate dynamical behaviors are also collisionless .    however , it is very difficult to probe and test these theoretical speculations in detail for a distant cluster whose angular extent is only a few arcminutes .",
    "the substantial decrease in gravitational distortion of source galaxy images , because of the large distance between the observer and the lens , also requires a precise measurement of a galaxy shape with a careful removal of the instrumental artifacts .",
    "weak - lensing studies of high - redshift clusters benefit remarkably from the recent installation of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on @xmath12 , which can resolve faint , more highly distorted distant galaxies ( jee et al . 2005 , hereafter j05 ; lombardi et al . 2005 ) . because of a high number density of background galaxies in the cluster field , the resulting mass reconstruction is capable of tracing the dark matter distribution in great detail .    in the current paper , we present the first weak - lensing study of ms 1054 - 0321 using the acs observations and a reanalysis of the archival @xmath3 x - ray data .",

    "1990 ; henry et al . 1992",
    "; gioia & luppino 1994 ) , has received profuse attention during the past decade because of its unusual richness at such a high - redshift ( e.g. , gioia & luppino 1994 ; luppino & kaiser 1997 ; donahue et al .",

    "the mere existence of such a massive cluster at @xmath13 can impose strong constraints on the cosmological parameters , favoring a low - density universe ( e.g. , bahcall & fan 1998 ; donahue et al .",
    "1998 ; jeltema et al . 2001 ) or non - gaussianity of the primordial density fluctuations ( willick 2000 ) .",
    "the first @xmath12 weak - lensing study of the cluster was performed by hoekstra , franx , & kuijken ( 2000 , hereafter hfk00 ) using wfpc2 observations .",
    "their mass reconstruction revealed a complicated mass distribution characterized by three dominant clumps , in good spatial agreement with the cluster galaxy concentrations .",
    "the x - ray studies ( e.g. , neumann & arnaud 2000 ; clowe et al .",
    "2000 ; jeltema et al .",
    "2001 ) have demonstrated there are only two distinct x - ray peaks corresponding to the central and western clumps in the hfk00 mass distribution .",
    "the question whether the absence of the third peak is due to the low x - ray emission of the eastern clump or to an artifact in the weak - lensing mass reconstruction was raised ( jeltema et al . 2001 ) . because the wide field channel ( wfc ) of acs has twice the sampling resolution of the wide field ( wf ) chips of wfpc2 and a factor of 5 improvement in sensitivity",
    ", the use of acs observations in the weak - lensing analysis can substantially improve the signal - to - noise ratio of the resulting mass reconstruction , therefore enabling us to test the significance of the cluster substructure presented by hfk00 .",
    "the x - ray study of ms1054 has an interesting history .",

    "( 2004 ) from the xmm - newton observations . with the possibility of time variability excluded",
    ", these different temperature estimates simply demonstrate that the x - ray temperature measurement is sensitive to the analysis procedure as well as the maturity of the calibration of the instrument .",
    "for example , gioia et al.(2004 ) were able to reproduce all the results of jeltema et al .",
    "( 2001 ) by duplicating the previous analysis procedures of the @xmath3 data .",
    "however , when they altered the flare interval removal ( resulting in shorter exposure time ) and corrected for the quantum efficiency degradation , their results became consistent with the xmm - newton measurements .    despite these already copious x - ray studies in the literature",
    ", we present our reanalysis of the @xmath3 archival data of ms 1054 - 0321 for the following two reasons .",
    "first , our understanding of the @xmath3 instrument is still evolving and we find that the application of the new calibration data affects the derived physical quantities of the cluster .",
    "second , we attempt to make a direct comparison between the results of the weak - lensing and the x - ray studies in terms of the total gravitating mass as well as the cluster substructure .",
    "our previous acs weak - lensing study ( j05 ) of another high - redshift cluster cl 0152 - 1357 at a very similar redshift ( @xmath22 ) revealed a significant substructure interestingly offset from the x - ray and cluster galaxies , suggestive of an on - going merger of the two main clumps . because ms 1054 - 0321 also possesses distinct substructure well traced by @xmath3 and weak - lensing analyses , the current study is a good test to see whether we can detect similar offsets between the dark matter , icm , and cluster galaxies .    throughout the paper",

    "we combine the extensive spectroscopic catalog of the ms 1054 - 0321 field ( van dokkum et al .",

    "we define a spectroscopically confirmed member as a galaxy whose redshift lies between @xmath41 , which results in a total of 143 objects ( figure  [ fig_spec_member ] ) .",
    "we assume that the sample is almost complete for galaxies brighter than @xmath42 regardless of galaxy colors . for the intermediate magnitude range ( @xmath43 )",

    "must be subtracted from first - hand measurements of object shapes .",
    "the geometric distortion of acs , primarily due to the location of the instrument far from the telescope axis , is more significant than any of the previous @xmath12 instruments .",
    "the uncorrected wfc image possesses an elongation of @xmath62% along the diagonal , thus causing the sky - projected pixel to appear rhombus - shaped .",
    "apsis corrects the geometric distortion of wfc images using the latest detector distortion model ( meurer et al .",
    "2003 ; anderson 2002 ) , which is derived from the observations of the core of 47 tucanae . a fourth - order polynomial is used to characterize the distortion to an accuracy much better than 0.2 pixels over the entire field of view ( pavlovsky et al .",
    "precise image alignment is also a principal requirement in a weak - lensing analysis because a slight registration error can imitate gravitational shears , inducing a coherent elongation of object shapes .",
    "apsis calculates the image offsets by matching astronomical objects between different exposures .",
    "the typical shift uncertainty of @xmath63 pixels satisfies our analysis requirement .",
    "the point - spread - function ( psf ) of the wfc varies across the field even in the rectified image , and both the magnitude and orientation of the ellipticity change with the focus offset of the instrument ( krist 2003 ) . in the previous work ( j05 )",
    ", we demonstrated that the psf model constructed from the 47 tucanae observations can excellently describe the psf pattern of the cluster field when a slight adjustment of the ellipticity is made .",
    "the psf of acs was decomposed via @xmath64 ( bernstein & jarvis 2002 , hereafter bj02 ; refregier 2003 ) and the spatial variation was modeled by polynomial interpolation of the shapelet coefficients ( see j05 for details ) .",
    "initial selection of stars in the ms 1054 - 0321 field was made using the half - light radius versus magnitude plot . after discarding defective stars by visual inspection ,",
    "the list contained 94 good stars .",
    "we matched these stars in the cluster field to our model psf derived from the 47 tucanae field .",
    "the overall agreement is satisfactory , but there exist tiny , but systematic residuals , which are suspected to arise from the focus breathing of the instrument .",
    "we were able to further reduce these systematics by introducing the following ellipticity fine - tuning :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the shapelet coefficient of the acs psf before ( after ) the adjustment and @xmath67 is the shear operator that modifies the ellipticity by @xmath68 to improve the agreement",
    ". the evaluation of matrix elements of the shear operator @xmath69 can be found in bj02 .",
    "the fine - tuning parameter @xmath70 is held fixed within a field , but allowed to vary between exposures .",
    "figure  [ fig_starfield ] and  [ fig_star_anisotropy ] illustrate the psf pattern observed in the @xmath28 mosaic image of the ms 1054 - 0321 field before and after the correction is applied .",
    "the correction is made by constructing a rounding kernel ( fischer & tyson 1997 ; kaiser 2000 ; bj02 ) and convolving the stars with this kernel .",
    "however , as discussed in j05 ( see also bj02 and seljak 2004 ) , the rounding kernel method has several drawbacks compared to the momentum - based deconvolution . therefore , we use this rounding kernel only for the verification of the psf matching , and the actual correction is made through the deconvolution in shapelet space .",
    "galaxy shapes are decomposed via the following polar shapelets ( see refregier 2003 for cartesian coordinates ) : @xmath71    @xmath72    @xmath73    where @xmath74 are the laguerre polynomials .",
    "because our model psf is also compactly described by these shapelets , we are able to perform the deconvolution through a simple matrix algebra :    @xmath75    where @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 are the deconvolved image , the observed image , and the convolution matrix .",
    "then , we transform the psf - corrected image @xmath79 by applying translation , dilation , and shear operators : @xmath80 where the @xmath69 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 are the shear , dilation , and translation operators defined in bj02 .    by requiring the above transformation to satisfy the condition @xmath83",
    ", we can determine the ellipticity @xmath84 when both centroid and significance are optimized ( bj02 ) .",
    "we select our source galaxies whose @xmath85 colors are bluer than @xmath86 . in general , one desires to include as faint galaxies as possible because fainter galaxies are subject to greater distortion due to their higher cosmological distance from the lens .",
    "however , they also have larger uncertainties in their shape measurement arising from their poorer photon statistics in addition to greater correction factors for the removal of psf effect . in order to establish a cutoff magnitude in our source galaxy catalog",
    ", we examined the variation of the lensing signal for three different magnitude samples : @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) , @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) , and @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "one useful way to compare the strength of the overall lensing signal is to inspect the tangential shear defined as : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the position angle of the object with respect to the cluster center .",
    "the amplitude of the tangential shear and the einstein radius determined from the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) fitting to each sample suggest that we can include background galaxies down to @xmath95 without diluting the signal ( figure  [ fig_tan_shear_mag ] ) .",
    "we excluded the shears @xmath96 at @xmath97 in the sis fitting because we suspect that the measurement in this region is severely affected by the cluster substructure .",
    "we investigated whether there also exists a strong color dependence in the signal amplitude .",
    "the galaxies in the @xmath89 sample are divided into @xmath98 @xmath89 and @xmath99 @xmath89 galaxies so that the sub - samples contain a roughly equal number of galaxies . as presented in figure  [ fig_tan_shear_color ] , we find the signal from @xmath98 @xmath100 are notably stronger , yielding an einstein radius of @xmath101 .",
    "hfk00 also found that their bluer galaxies create a larger amplitude in their wfpc2 weak - lensing analysis of ms 1054 - 0321 .",
    "hfk00 suggested that their @xmath102 galaxies have a greater mean redshift .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that in the acs weak - lensing of cl 0152 - 1357 we did not find such a shear excess in the @xmath98 sample ( j05 ) . considering the similar depth in both observations",
    ", it appears that the difference originates from the large scale structure of the field . in the following discussion",
    "we regard the @xmath89 sample ( @xmath90 ) ( i.e. , including both red and blue sources ) as our best source catalog and the results hereafter are based on this catalog .",
    "the catalog contains a total of 5847 galaxies ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "the redshift distribution of source galaxies must be derived with extreme care because the critical density @xmath104 ( mass unit ) is a steep function of the source redshift for a high - redshift cluster .",
    "consequently , it has been often considered a major source of uncertainty for weak - lensing mass estimation ( e.g. , luppino & kaiser 1997 ) .",
    "however , the recent availability of a reliable photometric redshift catalog down to the faint limit of the source sample has remarkably stabilized the weak - lensing mass determination up to the cosmic variance .    in the current work ,",
    "we utilize the photometric redshift catalog of the ultra deep field ( udf ) , the deepest available patch of sky to date observed by both acs and the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) .",
    "the detailed description of the generation of the photometric redshift catalog will be addressed in a forthcoming paper ( d. coe et al . in preparation ) ; we give a brief description below .",
    "we performed the psf matching for different instruments and passbands using the stars present in the udf field .",
    "the object catalog obtained from the acs image is complemented with the objects only visible in the nicmos images .",
    "for the galaxy seds , we selected the new templates of the bayesian photometric redshift package ( bpz ) ( benitez 2004 ) , which are composed of the modified e , sbc , scd , and i m templates of coleman , wu , & weedman ( 1980 ) , two sb2 and sb3 starburst templates of kinney et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and one synthetic template from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) .",
    "the last synthetic sed was added to account for very young , but faint starburst galaxies , for which a good observed template is not available .    in order to minimize the discrepancy caused by the field variation of the mean redshift of source galaxies",
    ", we selected the udf galaxies by applying the same criteria as in the cluster field and determined the following @xmath105 for each magnitude bin : @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the angular diameter distance from the observer to the source and from the lens to the source , respectively .",
    "because our cluster observation is shallower than the udf , care must be taken not to ignore the incompleteness at faint limits , as well as the contamination by blue cluster galaxies .",
    "noise was added to the udf acs images to mimic the s / n of the cluster observation , and the `` mock '' catalogs created from this degraded udf acs images were used to unbias the estimation of @xmath109 for @xmath110 . for @xmath111 galaxies , we used the acs photometry catalog from the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) as a control field to estimate the contamination from the blue cluster galaxies .",
    "the final determination of @xmath112 corresponds to a single source plane at @xmath113 .",
    "we also found that this single source plane approximation would cause an overestimation of the reduced shear by @xmath114 when the first order correction derived by seitz & schneider ( 1997 ) and hfk00 was employed .",
    "this correction becomes important at the dense region of the cluster where the assumption @xmath115 breaks down .",
    "first , we consider parameterized models for a description of the mass profile of ms 1054 - 0321 . in order to minimize the effect of the cluster substructure",
    ", we use the tangential shears measured from @xmath116 to @xmath117 radii centered at the location of the bcg .",
    "the sis fit gives an einstein radius of @xmath118 ( @xmath119 kpc ) , yielding an aperture mass of @xmath120 within 1 mpc radius .",
    "under the same sis assumption , this mass is translated to a velocity dispersion of @xmath121 km@xmath122 .",
    "a similar einstein radius of @xmath123 is obtained when the singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) model is fit instead .",
    "in addition , the position angle of @xmath124 with respect to the x - axis of the image and the axis ratio of @xmath125 are consistent with the elongation of the cluster substructure .",
    "fitting an nfw profile to the tangential shears taken from @xmath116 to @xmath126 radii yields a concentration parameter of @xmath127 and a core radius of @xmath128 . because these two parameters are not independent ( i.e. , they can be traded off with each other and the @xmath129 contours are highly elongated in the diagonal direction ) , a wide range of the parameter values can describe the observed shear profile without significantly altering the quality of the fit .",
    "marginalizing with c=3.2 , we obtain a projected mass of @xmath130 .    for parameter - free estimation of the cluster mass profile",
    ", we use a conventional aperture mass densitometry as well as a rescaled ( @xmath131 ) mass reconstruction ( j05 ) .",
    "we constrain a mean surface mass density of an annulus from @xmath132 to @xmath133 to be @xmath134 utilizing the best - fit sis parameters . within 1 mpc aperture radius , we obtain @xmath135 and @xmath136 from aperture mass densitometry and mass reconstruction , respectively .",
    "we compare these various mass profiles in figure  [ fig_mass_profile ] .",
    "note that the mass profile derived from the mass reconstruction agrees nicely with that from aperture mass densitometry .",
    "this remarkable agreement was also observed in the weak - lensing analysis of cl 0152 - 1357 in j05 , and the use of the rescaled mass map ( @xmath131 ) is now encouraged in the mass estimation of the substructure .",
    "the best - fit sis profile describes the radial distribution of the cluster mass similar to the results from the parameter - free mass estimation whereas the nfw profile yields somewhat lower mass at large radii ( @xmath137% at 1 mpc ) .",
    "hfk00 quoted an aperture ( @xmath138 mpc ) mass of @xmath139 from the measurement of @xmath140 statistics in the @xmath141 universe .",
    "we find that their result is in good agreement with our aperture mass estimate of @xmath142 ( when our result is reproduced under their cosmological parameters ) .",
    "a caution must be made regarding the interpretation of the uncertainties quoted above .",
    "although our weak - lensing analysis benefits considerably from the unprecedentedly high number of background galaxies , the quoted uncertainties here only reflects the statistical errors . in  [ section_cosmic_shear ]",
    "we discuss the importance of the foreground / background cosmic shear effects and estimate how much they can limit the accuracy of our cluster mass determination .",
    "we can combine the light and the mass profile to examine the radial behavior of the cluster mass - to - light ratio ( figure  [ fig_mass2light ] ) .",
    "the cumulative @xmath143 ( open circle with error bar ) increases rapidly at small radii ( @xmath144 ) and continues to rise rather slowly reaching @xmath145 ( the uncertainty only reflects the statistical error in mass ) . at @xmath138mpc .",
    "this pattern is quite different from that for cl 0152 - 1357 , for which the cumulative @xmath143 arrives at its maximum at @xmath146 and decreases rather monotonically afterwards .",
    "the @xmath143 profile of cl 0152 - 1357 is very similar to that of an ensemble cluster compiled from the extensive kinematic studies of a large cluster sample ( carlberg et al .",
    "1997 ; katgert et al 2004 )",
    ". the outwardly increasing @xmath143 profile of ms 1054 - 0321 is also seen in hfk00 paper .",

    "we present the weak - lensing mass reconstruction of ms 1054 - 0321 and its rms in figure  [ fig_mass_contour ] and [ fig_err_map ] , respectively .",

    "it is apparent that the cluster galaxies trace the cluster mass fairly well .",
    "the mass distribution over the eastern clump , unlike the other two mass clumps , seems to be somewhat complicated as is also indicated by the color - coded light distribution .",
    "we conservatively select four mass clumps outside the main body where the significance is above the @xmath161 level and the galaxy counterparts are not ambiguous ( figure  [ fig_massoverplot ] ) .",
    "these four minor clumps ( m1 - 4 ) are located south of the main clumps ( c , w , and e ) and they appear to be infalling groups onto the main cluster .",
    "each of these minor clumps contain some bright early - type galaxies and its luminosity peak is close to the corresponding mass clump with an average offset of @xmath162 . because of the relatively weak shear signal and thus low significance of the mass centroid of each mass peak , it is hard to infer the dynamics of the clump based on its mass - to - galaxy offset .",
    "it is interesting to note that in our previous investigation we also identified four minor mass clumps spatially correlated with the cluster member galaxies outside the main body of cl 0152 - 1357 at z=0.84 ( j05 ) .",
    "if these clusters are found to represent the typical clusters at this redshift , the presence of these hypothesized infalling groups can provide direct support of hierarchical structure formation .",
    "some of the rest of the minor mass peaks in our ms 1054 - 0321 mass reconstruction seem to be associated with foreground objects in the field , but here we confine our analysis only to mass clumps obviously related to the substructure of ms 1054 - 0321 at @xmath50 .",
    "table 1 summarizes the properties of these mass clumps .",
    "the mass within @xmath163 ( @xmath164 kpc ) aperture radius is measured from the rescaled mass map , and the mass uncertainty is calculated using the rms map ( figure  [ fig_err_map ] ) under the assumption that the mass pixels within the aperture are entirely correlated .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio is computed only counting the spectroscopically confirmed members .",
    "therefore , the @xmath143 values quoted here correspond to the upper limits and in particular , for the minor clumps we suspect these @xmath143 values are largely overestimated because the incompleteness of the spectroscopic sample is higher for bluer cluster galaxies ( goto et al .",

    "this decline of the low energy sensitivity biases the temperature measurement upward unless accounted for .",
    "based on the observed decay rate determined from the external calibration source , chartas & getman ( 2002 ) introduced a time dependent acis absorption model ( acisabs ) , which describes the degradation of the qe as a function of the number of days since the launch .",

    "we observe that following this new procedure tends to yield a higher temperature than the acisabs prescription .",
    "another important preprocessing for the spectral analysis includes careful background flare removal .",

    "however , the temperature structure of ms 1054 - 0321 does not indicate such a feature between the centers of the two x - ray peaks .",

    "we discuss a possible scenario in association with the absence of the eastern x - ray peak in [ section_absence ] .",
    "the complicated substructure of the cluster makes it challenging to fit the surface brightness profile to an isothermal beta model , which assumes a spherical symmetry , and the attempts often lead to physically unreasonable parameters .",
    "we created an exposure - corrected image by binning 0.8 - 7 kev photons with @xmath198 pixels .",
    "initially , we attempted to model the surface brightness profile of the cluster with a superposition of two isothermal beta profiles . however , as noted by jeltema et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the central x - ray peak requires a large beta index ( @xmath199 ) whereas the western x - ray peak profile is nicely fit with a beta index of @xmath200 and a core radius of @xmath201 .",
    "we suspect that the large beta index for the central x - ray peak originates from the flat core , most probably due to recent merger activity .",
    "therefore , the mass calculation of the cluster from this approach is flawed and subject to overestimation .",
    "instead , we decided to fit a single isothermal beta profile to the entire cluster , excluding the complicated inner substructure .",
    "numerical simulations ( e.g. , rowley et al .",
    "2004 ) show that the merger of the global icm precedes that of the core merger , which tends to maintain the bulk motion up to the late stage of the event .",
    "if we assume ms 1054 - 0321 is undergoing a major merger between the western and central clumps , and also the central clump has already suffered a recent merger , we argue that our fitting a isothermal beta profile to the outer region of the x - ray profile minimizes the artifact arising from this hypothesized merger activity .    to this end , the binned x - ray image was first fitted to a single two - dimensional isothermal beta model to determine the centroid that maximizes the azimuthal symmetry . after the optimal centroid was determined at @xmath202 and @xmath203 , we constructed an azimuthally averaged surface brightness profile , which was then fit to one - dimensional isothermal beta model .",
    "because the centroid was placed @xmath204 apart from both x - ray peaks , we excluded the inner region ( @xmath205 ) from the fit , which yielded a core radius of @xmath206 and a @xmath105 index of @xmath207 .",
    "the uncertainties are computed with both parameters allowed to vary .",
    "the @xmath208 index or specific energy ratio of the dark matter and icm is defined as @xmath209 and we can predict a value of @xmath210 using @xmath211 kev and @xmath212 for the entire cluster .",

    "1996 ) : @xmath218 where @xmath219 is the core radius and the mean molecular weight of the gas is assumed to be 0.59 times the proton mass .",
    "equation  [ eqn_xray_mass_3d ] yields a total mass of the cluster within a spherical volume at @xmath220 and therefore it is not straightforward to compare this x - ray mass with the weak - lensing estimation , which typically gives an aperture mass inside a cylinder .",
    "however , because equation  [ eqn_xray_mass_3d ] already assumes a spherical symmetry , one can also estimate an analogous projected x - ray mass without any loss of generality .",

    "this mass is consistent with our parameter - free weak - lensing estimation . in [ xrayvslensing ]",
    "we present a detailed comparison of the x - ray mass profile with the weak - lensing result .",
    "in weak - lensing analysis , the largest uncertainty is introduced when the tangential shear is fit to a particular mass profile in order to constrain @xmath226 in a certain annulus .",
    "the accuracy in determining @xmath226 for a specified area depends on the conformity of the cluster mass profile to the parameterized model as well as the extent of azimuthal symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , we consider the uncertainty arising from these assumptions to be small for the current analysis because , in spite of the apparent substructure , the mass profile of ms 1054 - 0321 seems to be well described by the isothermal profile out to the field boundary at least in an azimuthally averaged sense . in addition , @xmath226 is expected to be small at the annulus near the field boundary and to approach @xmath227 with a minor dependence on the assumed model .    on the other hand ,",
    "the x - ray mass determination potentially harbors many ambiguities due to the indefiniteness of the assumptions involved .",
    "the hypothesis that the system is in hydrodynamic equilibrium is often questionable especially in high - redshift clusters where the clusters appear to be still in their forming stage . besides",
    ", many of these high - redshift clusters possess filamentary structure that makes it difficult to use equation  [ eqn_xray_mass_3d ] or  [ eqn_xray_mass_2d ] , which necessitates an assumption of a spherically symmetric mass distribution .",
    "in addition , the accurate measurement of the x - ray structural parameters ( i.e. , the determination of the core radius and @xmath105 index ) is a challenging task , especially for high - redshift clusters where the cosmological surface brightness dimming reduces the photon statistics substantially .",
    "we compare a variety of the mass profiles of ms 1054 - 0321 in figure  [ fig_many_profiles ] .",
    "the x - ray mass profiles are computed using equation  [ eqn_xray_mass_2d ] for different isothermal beta model parameters .",
    "first , note that the x - ray mass profile for the parameters determined in  [ isothermalbeta ] ( @xmath228 and @xmath229 ) maintains a consistency with the weak - lensing mass profile .    a blind isothermal beta profile fitting gives unrealistically large values for the beta ( @xmath230 ) and the core radius ( @xmath231 ) of ms 1054 - 0321 as already mentioned in [ isothermalbeta ] .",
    "the resulting aperture mass at @xmath138 mpc radius would also become unacceptably huge ( @xmath232 ) .",
    "jeltema et al .",
    "( 2001 ) obtained a core radius of @xmath233 when the beta is frozen to unity .",
    "these two parameters along with their temperature measurement of @xmath234 kev suggest a total projected mass of @xmath235 , which is still larger than our x - ray estimate of @xmath10 .",
    "however , we note that the virial mass that jeltema et al .",
    "( 2001 ) computed from the mass - temperature scaling relation ( evrard et al . 1996 ; arnaud & evrard 1999 ) is similar to our result and the comparison is presented in [ section_virialradius ] .",
    "although it is encouraging to observe a nice concordance between the x - ray and weak - lensing masses in this particular study , we do not expect that there exists a general agreement for other clusters .",
    "mainly , we attribute the reconciliation of the mass properties in the current study to the excellent conformity of the large scale gas and mass profiles of ms 1054 - 0321 to that of the isothermal model ( i.e. , @xmath236 and @xmath237 ) out to a large distance from the cluster center despite the apparent temperature variation and cluster substructure . the current method of x - ray mass estimation is limited by the assumption of the isothermality of the cluster profile .",
    "accordingly , the x - ray mass estimation is not always guaranteed to lead to an unbiased result at large radii where the extrapolation of the x - ray profile determined within a small aperture is often problematic .",
    "for example , although j05 obtained a weak - lensing mass similar to the x - ray result at small radii for cl 0152 - 1357 ( a difference of @xmath238% at @xmath239 ) , the discrepancy increases continuously toward the field edge because the actual cluster mass profile determined from weak - lensing rises more slowly than the isothermal sphere at large radii , favoring an nfw description .",
    "the gravitational lensing signal is sensitive to all matter along the line of sight . as a result ,",
    "the shape of a background galaxy is distorted not only by the cluster mass , but also by the background large scale structure in front of and behind the cluster . in the general application of weak - lensing to cluster mass estimation ,",
    "the cluster is assumed to be the dominant source of signal and the contribution from this cosmic structure is often neglected .",
    "such lack of concern for the background structure can be justified in many situations where the statistical errors resulting from the discrete sampling of the signal overwhelms the uncertainties caused by the large scale structure .",

    "the value is very close to our weak - lensing prediction ( [ mass_estimate ] ) of @xmath121 km@xmath122 under the sis assumption the empirical relation between x - ray temperature and velocity dispersion is rather scattered around the theoretical @xmath282 line . adopting ( @xmath283 ( wu et al .",

    "the conversion of our weak - lensing result to their cosmological parameters yields a projected mass of @xmath290 ( @xmath287 ) , which is in good agreement with the sz estimation .",
    "it may be considered surprising to observe the converging results between weak - lensing and other various analyses above especially for this high - redshift cluster .",
    "one interpretation of these impressive agreements is that the dynamical structure of ms 1054 - 0321 may already have matured even at @xmath13 to the extent that at least the azimuthally averaged properties do not depart greatly from that of a relaxed cluster in spite of the elongated appearance of the cluster galaxy distribution",
    ". it will be interesting to examine in future investigations how critical the role of the icm is in the global virialization of the cluster .      in [ substructure ] , we discussed the cluster substructure revealed by the weak - lensing mass reconstruction in comparison with the cluster luminosity distribution .",
    "a careful examination of the mass / light overlay ( figure  [ fig_massoverlum ] ) shows that there present some offsets between the mass and luminosity centroids . in order to investigate the statistical significance of these offsets , we ran a 5000 bootstrap resampling of background galaxies and measured the centroid of the mass peaks from each realization .",
    "we found that only the central and western mass clumps possess statistically significant offsets with respect to the corresponding luminosity peaks .",
    "figure  [ fig_centroid_test ] demonstrates that both luminosity centers are outside the 99% circle of the mass peak centroid distribution .",
    "another important question in this mass - light centroid comparison is whether the above luminosity centroids are fair locations to compare with the mass centroids .",
    "if the luminosity centroids are severely affected by the incompleteness and/or the smoothing kernel size , we may also need to consider the resulting uncertainties in our analysis .",
    "we present the overlay of the detailed luminosity contours of the central and western clumps on top of their color images in figure  [ fig_lum_centroids ] .",
    "the luminosity contours are drawn in white , and red squares are placed on the spectroscopically confirmed members .",
    "we also mark the mass centroids with green circles .",
    "it is apparent that the luminosity centroids are mostly influenced by the bcgs .",
    "the smoothed central luminosity peak has its centroid only @xmath291 apart from the location of the bcg .",
    "the offset is @xmath292 for the western luminosity clump .",
    "we remember that the luminosity map is smoothed with a fwhm@xmath158 gaussian kernel whereas we used a fwhm@xmath159 kernel for the smoothing of the mass map .",
    "considering an additional smoothing ( @xmath159 ) implicitly done in averaging source ellipcities before the mass reconstruction , we estimate that the fwhm of @xmath293 for the luminosity smoothing is a proper kernel size to ensure a comparable smoothing scale ( dispersion by finite sizes of galaxies can be neglected because the fwhm@xmath158 gaussian kernel is so dominant ) .",
    "if one argues that a smaller kernel must have been used in smoothing the light distribution in order to secure a fair comparison , it is easy to ascertain that a smaller kernel will only shift the luminosity centroids toward the bcgs , enlarging the offset between the luminosity and mass centroids .",
    "alternatively , if one prefers a larger kernel for a luminosity map , we find that increasing kernel size reduces the offsets between the luminosity and mass centroids , which , nevertheless , still remain significant at a 2@xmath166 level ( @xmath294 and @xmath295 for the central and western clumps , respectively ) up to a fwhm@xmath264 . of course , for this large kernel ( fwhm@xmath264 ) , the contribution from the cluster members absent from the spectroscopic catalog may become relatively important .",
    "however , the examination of the distribution of unconfirmed cluster candidates around the bcgs does not convince us that this will modify the significance of the mass / luminosity offsets substantially .",
    "given the above argument that the luminosity centroids stay close to the bcgs for the reasonable values of the smoothing kernel , we list the following possibilities as causes of the observed offsets :    * noises from discrete sampling of background galaxies , * systematics shifts due to foreground masses , and * real features reflecting different hydrodynamical properties of individual cluster constituents .",
    "_ noises from discrete sampling of background galaxies .",
    "_ in general , the finite sampling of the background galaxies whose spatial distribution is not uniform scatters the centroids of mass reconstruction from their true positions .",
    "the stability of the centroids are mainly determined by the strength of the lensing signal as well as the number density of available source galaxies . as we found",
    "that the signal around the two mass peaks is very strong and the number density of sources is unprecedentedly high ( @xmath103 ) , the uncertainty of the centroids are expected to be small .",
    "one of the most useful tests to assess the errors is a bootstrap resampling of background galaxies discussed above .",
    "the result is consistent with our intuition that the more pronounced peak ( the western mass clump ) has a smaller dispersion than the weaker one ( the central mass clump ) . because both luminosity centroids are significantly outside the 99% enclosing circle of the corresponding mass centroids ( figure  [ fig_centroid_test ] ) , it is very unlikely that the observed mass / light offsets originate from the noises .",
    "_ systematic shifts due to foreground masses .",
    "_ as light rays are perturbed by any objects between the observer and source , we can not preclude the possibility that there might exist some foreground / background masses responsible for the mass centroids . in [ section_cosmic_shear ]",
    ", we have estimated the uncertainties in our cluster mass due to the presence of other large scale structures .",
    "in particular , lower redshift foreground objects can work as more efficient lens and measurably alter the mass map even if their masses are not as significant as that of ms 1054 - 3021 .",
    "one of the most unambiguous tests is to perform a so - called weak - lensing tomography , which can , in principle , separate the cluster mass from the dynamically uncorrelated background / foreground structures .",
    "the technique , however , requires us to obtain a good photometric redshift knowledge of individual sources and thus can become practical only in the future .    nevertheless , without this sophisticated check ,",
    "it is still possible to discuss the effects of these possible interlopers by scrutinizing our mass map .",
    "if the foreground masses are to greatly affect the centroids of the cluster mass clumps , they must have a rather peaked distribution whose width ( e.g. , fwhm ) is less than or comparable to those of the cluster mass peaks .",
    "( if the foreground mass distributions are much smoother than the characteristic scale of the mass peaks , they can not shift the cluster centroids by the large amount as observed in our case ) .",
    "besides , the peaked foreground mass must be located very close to the mass centroids of the cluster perhaps within a smoothing kernel ( fwhm@xmath296 ) in order to shift the centroids . otherwise , we suspect that they should reveal themselves as separate peaks in our high - resolution mass reconstruction .",
    "finally , we analyze the spectroscopic catalog of the cluster field to examine if there is any concentration of foreground galaxies . out of 325 objects",
    "whose redshifts are known , about @xmath297 galaxies are found to lie foreground . although the spectroscopic survey is incomplete and still in progress ( tran et al . in preparation ) , we found no significant foreground groups near the two cluster mass centroids .",
    "_ real features reflecting different hydrodynamical properties of individual cluster constituents .",
    "_ there is a growing list of x - ray clusters whose intracluster gas might have been swept back behind the corresponding cluster galaxies possibly due to the ram pressure ( e.g. , markevitch et al .",
    "2002 ; maughan et al . 2003 ; scharf et al .",
    "although the discovery is rather recent , the icm - galaxy offsets seem to be acquiring increasing observational supports . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass - galaxy offsets have not been reported in any other investigations yet except in our previous weak - lensing analysis of cl 0152 - 1357 ( j05 ) .",
    "markevitch et al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggest that one can use the mass - galaxy displacements to constrain the collisional cross - section of the dark matter particles because , if cluster galaxies are to suffer any deceleration from the dark matter collisions , the cluster galaxies should be hauled by the dominant dark matter potential well and appear to be displaced away from the merging direction .",
    "alternatively , one can also propose a different scenario wherein the dark matter particles are purely collisionless , but collisional properties of the cluster galaxies are not negligible .",
    "this is against a conventional yet disputable belief that galaxies are effectively collisionless .",
    "detailed numerical simulations must be followed in order to estimate whether the effect is measurable and can lead to such an observed offset .    as argued by clowe et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the mass - icm offset can be used to support the existence of dark matter .",
    "there have been some attempts to explain the `` missing matter '' , particularly in clusters of galaxies , in the context of the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ; milgrom 1983 ) .",
    "the mond theory has been partly successful in describing the observed velocity dispersions of galaxy clusters as well as rotation curves of spiral galaxies without inclusion of dark matter by modifying the newtonian gravity so that the inertia mass of a particle is decreased in the limit of low accelerations ( e.g. , mcgaugh & de blok 1998 ; sanders 2003 ; milgrom & sanders 2003 ) .",
    "recently , bekenstein ( 2004 ) has proposed a relativistic extension of mond , which now predicts definite gravitational lensing .",
    "if we view the cluster in this mond paradigm , the centroids of the mass clumps are expected to lie on top of the x - ray peaks , which trace the dominant baryonic component of the cluster . however , our lensing analysis ( figure  [ fig_mass_xray ] ) shows with high significance that the locations of these x - ray peaks are not where the dominant cluster mass is concentrated .",
    "a similar trend is observed in the weak - lensing analysis of the interacting cluster 1e 0657 - 558 ( clowe et al .",
    "the 1e 0657 - 558 cluster shows not only the dramatic bow - shock from the x - ray emission , but also the two dark matter clumps conspicuously offset from the corresponding x - ray peaks .",
    "as is clear in figure  [ fig_mass_xray ] , the chandra observation does not detect any x - ray excess over the eastern region of ms 1054 - 0321 where the weak - lensing and luminosity map reveal distinct mass concentrations .",
    "the absence of this third weak lensing peak in the x - ray observation was first observed by clowe et al .",
    "( 2000 ) in the comparison of the rosat / hri x - ray analysis with their keck weak - lensing result .",
    "jeltema et al . (",
    "2001 ) proposed two possibilities regarding the discrepancy : immaturity of the eastern clump or an artifact of noisy mass reconstruction caused by sub - optimal smoothing ( marshall 2002 ) .",
    "the high significance of the substructure detected by the unprecedentedly high number density of source galaxies using @xmath12/acs images immediately rules out the second possibility . besides , the consistency of our weak - lensing substructure with the result of hfk00 despite the different selection and measurement of background galaxies , as well as the overdensity of the spectroscopically confirmed cluster galaxies at the eastern mass clump evidence that this eastern substructure is real .",
    "the first scenario that the third clump has not fully developed into an x - ray system is an interesting possibility , considering the extremely high temperature ( @xmath298 ) required for thermal bremsstrahlung radiation . as seen by the cluster light distribution",
    ", the cluster galaxies in this region appear to be less concentrated and luminous than in the other two clumps .",
    "the weak - lensing mass in the eastern clump is also somewhat lower ( @xmath299% of the western mass clump ) .",
    "however , the predicted gas temperature derived from an empirical @xmath300 relation ( e.g. , wu et al .",
    "1998 ) is @xmath301 kev after the projected mass ( @xmath302 within @xmath163 ) is converted to the velocity dispersion ( @xmath303 ) under sis assumption .",
    "hence , even considering the scattered @xmath300 relation and the surface brightness dimming at @xmath13 , it is difficult to justify the lack of the x - ray emission exclusively by the low temperature of the subcluster .",
    "the western lynx cluster rxj 0848 + 4453 at z=1.27 ( stanford et al .",
    "2001 ) has even a lower x - ray temperature of @xmath304 kev with a weak - lensing mass of @xmath305 mpc@xmath306 ( m. jee et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , but the @xmath3 x - ray image confirms the presence of the x - ray emission associated with the cluster .",
    "an alternative scenario can be envisaged , in which most of the intracluster gas of the eastern clump has been stripped while passing through the dense region of the central substructure .",
    "if we imagine that clump e traveled from the southwest of clump c and passed through it possibly with an off - center collision , clump e would then lose a significant fraction of its icm , or most of its icm would become bound to that of clump c , leaving a double - peaked structure as is hinted in our current x - ray contours .",
    "this post - merger picture is partly supported by the temperature structure of the cluster ( figure  [ fig_temp_map ] ) showing that the cluster temperature is rapidly rising in opposite directions from the central x - ray peak to the east and the west as mentioned in [ xraytemp ] .",
    "a similar temperature structure is observed in numerical simulations of cluster icm and particularly takizawa ( 2000 ) demonstrated in his off - center merger simulation that double - peak features in x - ray emission would survive even after the most violent epoch .",
    "the flat inner region ( possibly with double core ) of the central x - ray peak yields a @xmath105 index that is greater than unity (  [ isothermalbeta ] ) when the azimuthally averaged radial profile is fit to the isothermal beta profile .",
    "the large @xmath105 value indicates that the icm of the region might have been distorted due to the recent merger .",
    "the numerical simulation by takizawa ( 1999 ) showed that the specific energy ratio of dark matter and the icm ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn_specific_ratio ] ) remains greater than unity even in the late stage of the merger event .",
    "in addition , the rather scattered distribution of cluster galaxies and dark matter in the eastern region might be associated with the gravitational disruption during this hypothesized pass - through .    because the current resolution of the temperature map is not limited by the optical resolution , but by the poor photon statistics , a longer exposure x - ray observation of ms 1054 - 0321 will provide more significant details of the thermodynamical structure out to a larger distance from the cluster center and enable us to test this merger hypothesis further .      since more massive clusters are believed to have collapsed earlier within a hierarchical structure formation paradigm , it is natural to conjecture that these clusters are also more likely to possess higher @xmath143 values resulting from their older stellar population ( bahcall & comerford 2002 ) . compared with cl 0152 - 1357 ( j05 ) at a similar redshift of z=0.84 , ms 1054 - 0321 has both higher mass and @xmath143 within 1 mpc , consistent with the hypothesis that @xmath143 values increase with cluster richness .",
    "if ms 1054 - 03 is indeed being formed by the hierarchical infall of the smaller mass clumps , which have collapsed at different times , we can also extend and apply the above argument to the wide range of @xmath143 ratios of the substructure .",
    "table 1 shows that the @xmath143 ratios of the cluster main clumps ( e , c , and w ) increase with their masses ( we do not include the minor clumps ( m1 - 4 ) in the discussion because of the reasons explained in [ substructure ] ) .",
    "if this trend is interpreted as an indication of the formation time sequence , the highest @xmath143 value of the western clump may signify the earliest formation epoch of the substructure .",
    "this speculation is further supported by the cluster metallicty distribution ( table 3;[xraytemp ] ) .",
    "the western x - ray peak has higher metal abundance than the other x - ray peak , which suggests that the stellar contents of the galaxies associated with the western x - ray peak might be older .",
    "we have presented our @xmath12/acs weak - lensing and @xmath3 x - ray analysis of ms 1054 , guided with an extensive spectroscopic survey data of the cluster field .",
    "the weak - lensing mass reconstruction , empowered by the superb resolution and sensitivity of acs , not only confirms the existence of the three dominant mass clumps reported by hfk00 , but also further resolves the cluster substructure in unprecedented detail .    in the @xmath3 x - ray analysis",
    ", we took care to properly compensate for the low - energy dqe degradation of the instrument .",
    "as demonstrated by a variety of different results in the literature , the temperature measurement is sensitive to the applied correction .",
    "in addition to the low - energy dqe correction , it has been realized that even a mild background flare can bias the temperature measurement by a few kev .",
    "utilizing the newly available calibration data and recommendation from ciao , we obtained @xmath7 kev for the cluster temperature as a whole .",
    "as first noted by jeltema et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the western x - ray peak has a lower temperature than the central x - ray peak . in our temperature map , the cluster seems to have a severe temperature variation across the field .",
    "we excluded the central region ( @xmath205 ) in our determination of the structural parameter because otherwise the substructure leads to a physically unacceptable condition for a relaxed isothermal beta sphere , where the cluster dark matter possesses a significantly higher temperature than the icm particles .",
    "we found that the isothermal beta description of the cluster with @xmath9 and @xmath8 yields a consistent mass profile with that from weak - lensing .",
    "the comparison of the weak - lensing mass map with the x - ray contours provides an invaluable opportunity to examine how differently these two cluster constituents are distributed within the cluster .",
    "the relatively circular distribution of the icm in contrast to the rather elongated arrangement of cluster galaxies is consistent with the expectation that the icm has reached a higher degree of virialization than the cluster galaxies and dark matter . on the other hand , the distribution of the cluster dark matter looks somewhat similar to that of the cluster s optical luminosity .",
    "apart from the offsets between the two x - ray peaks and the corresponding dark matter clumps , as first observed in our previous study of cl 0152 - 1357 , we note that there present offsets between the dark matter and the cluster galaxy centroids in ms 1054 - 0321 . through bootstrap resampling experiments ,",
    "we demonstrate that the offsets between the dark matter and cluster galaxy centroids are statistically significant .",
    "we argue that it is unlikely that the observed offsets are mainly caused either by the different smoothing scale of the light map or the incompleteness of the spectroscopic survey catalog .",
    "it is possible that any significant foreground mass lying close to the mass peaks can potentially affect the mass centroids .",
    "although we can not prove with current data that this possibility is completely ruled out using the so - called weak - lensing tomography , the analysis of the current spectroscopic catalog does not support any presence of such foreground groups nearby the mass centroids .",
    "in addition , it is hard to imagine that all the four mass peaks in ms 1054 - 0321 and cl 0152 - 1357",
    "coincidently possess close neighbors in projection , which all cause the centroids to look shifted toward the hypothesized merging direction .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the observed offsets between the mass and galaxy centroids might reflects the real features , indicative of a merger between the substructures .    the eastern weak - lensing clump is not detected in x - rays , and possible scenarios have been discussed . because the eastern mass peak was also clearly detected by hfk00 even with a different selection of background galaxies and the overdensity of the cluster galaxy is present at the location , we rule out the possibility that it is an artifact of the mass reconstruction . as the estimated x - ray temperature ( @xmath307 kev ) of the unseen eastern clump based on",
    "the projected mass is sufficient for thermal bremsstrahlung radiation , it is not clear whether the lack of the detection is entirely due to the immaturity of the subcluster . alternatively",
    ", we suspect that the icm of the eastern clump might have been substantially stripped off during its merger with the cluster main body .",
    "the first indication of this scenario comes from the temperature structure resembling the propagation of the shock - heated region along the merger axis observed in numerical simulations .",
    "if the subcluster had passed through the dense region of the central clump from the southwest , we suspect that it is possible to observe this kind of temperature gradient increasing in opposite directions .",
    "although this interpretation of the temperature map is not unique , the scenario is further supported by the rather anomalous x - ray profile of the central x - ray peak .",
    "even after the western substructure is carefully removed , the remaining structure can not be well described by an isothermal beta model because the core region is too diffuse .",
    "this may suggest that the icm structure might have been recently disrupted and we are just observing the transient state prior to its returning to relaxed distribution .",

    "<S> we present @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2/advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) weak - lensing and @xmath3 x - ray analyses of ms 1054 - 0321 at z=0.83 , the most distant and x - ray luminous cluster in the @xmath4 extended medium - sensitivity survey ( emss ) . the high - resolution mass reconstruction through acs weak - lensing reveals the complicated dark matter substructure in unprecedented detail , characterized by the three dominant mass clumps with the four or more minor satellite groups within the current acs field . </S>",
    "<S> the direct comparison of the mass map with the @xmath3 x - ray image shows that the eastern weak - lensing substructure is not present in the x - ray image and , more interestingly , the two x - ray peaks are displaced away from the hypothesized merging direction with respect to the corresponding central and western mass clumps , possibly because of ram pressure . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , as observed in our previous weak - lensing study of another high - redshift cluster cl 0152 - 1357 at @xmath5 , the two dark matter clumps of ms 1054 - 0321 seem to be offset from the galaxy counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the significance of these offsets and discuss a possible scenario , wherein the dark matter clumps might be moving ahead of the cluster galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the non - parametric weak - lensing mass modeling gives a projected mass of @xmath6 , where the uncertainty reflects both the statistical error and the cosmic shear effects . </S>",
    "<S> our temperature measurement of @xmath7 kev utilizing the newest available low - energy quantum efficiency degradation prescription for the @xmath3 instrument , together with the isothermal beta description of the cluster ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , yields a projected mass of @xmath10 , consistent with the weak - lensing result . </S>"
