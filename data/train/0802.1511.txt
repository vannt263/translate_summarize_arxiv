    "the currents in loops 1 to @xmath31 are described by a vector @xmath32 ; the induced flux @xmath33 in the loops is then given by @xmath34 in the case of a superconducting washer with vanishingly small london penetration depth @xmath35 , the flux quantization condition @xmath36 requires a constant distribution of fluxes through the washer .",

    "a single vortex trapped in the squid washer induces an effective flux offset in the squid .",
    "the magnitude of this effect can be understood by considering a few simple examples .",
    "first , for a vortex trapped in an infinite superconducting sheet , the phase change between points above and below the vortex is @xmath39 , corresponding to a @xmath40 flux shift . by symmetry , this phase change is unchanged if the vortex is centered in a superconducting strip of finite width .",
    "a vortex in a squid with a narrow washer @xmath41 will similarly produce a flux offset of @xmath40 in the squid if the vortex is placed in the center of the wire at @xmath42 . for a vortex placed near the inner radius @xmath10",
    ", the flux offset will approach @xmath43 , whereas a vortex placed near the outer radius @xmath11 will give a flux offset approaching @xmath44 . for vortices",
    "trapped uniformly throughout the narrow washer , the average flux offset will be @xmath40 .    to calculate the coupling between a squid and a vortex trapped in the squid washer at radius @xmath16 , we consider a radially symmetric geometry that is amenable to the calculation technique described above . from symmetry , the flux coupling is independent of angular orientation of the vortex around the washer . thus , the flux coupling from one vortex is equivalent to @xmath45 vortices of magnitude @xmath46 placed around the washer with uniform angular spacing and identical radius . as @xmath47 ,",
    "the vortices are equivalent to a cut in the washer with a net flux through the cut of magnitude @xmath5 .",
    "this problem can now be solved using the matrix inversion technique of eq .",
    "[ eq : invert ] . for the solution",
    ", we need to calculate the effective flux @xmath48 that must be applied to the squid so that the total circulating current is unchanged when a flux quantum is applied to the cut .",
    "the flux profile in the loops is thus @xmath49 the offset flux @xmath48 is solved using eq .",

    "@xmath57 = 1.02 ; ( red ) @xmath57 = 5 .",
    "the average flux offset for the thin washer is @xmath58 , whereas for the large washer we find @xmath59 . ]",
    "what is the physical source of the offset flux ?",
    "vortex currents , although localized mostly around the core , fall off over a long distance .",
    "part of the current must then circulate around the center hole of the squid washer , giving an effective flux offset to the squid loop .",
    "the total magnetic flux through a vortex is quantized , and has contributions from magnetic fields generated by the currents circulating around the vortex along with any externally applied magnetic field .",
    "this external magnetic field is typically considered to be zero because of screening from the superconductor . however ,",
    "the surface spins located within the vortex are strongly coupled to the vortex , so their magnetic flux can not be neglected .",
    "as these spins become polarized , they couple a flux @xmath60 to the vortex ; the quantization condition requires a redistribution of currents in the vortex .",
    "the change in average flux coupled to the squid is thus @xmath61 per vortex for the thick washer geometry consider previously .    to calculate @xmath62 we rely on reciprocity",
    ": if we know the current distribution in the vortex , we can calculate the magnetic fields at all points in space .",
    "this allows us to calculate the coupling to a spin at an arbitrary location ; the total flux is obtained by integrating over the area of the vortex .",
    "we first discuss calculation of the current distribution in the vortex , then we describe the coupling of the vortex to surface spins .",
    "we model the vortex as a superconducting washer with inner radius @xmath63 and outer radius @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the coherence length .",
    "the current distribution is calculated using the techniques described in section i. in this case , however , we have a penetration depth @xmath35 that is larger than the inner dimensions of the washer , and flux is not constant across the superconductor .",
    "instead , single - valuedness of the superconducting wavefunction imposes the following quantization condition : @xmath66 where the integral on the right - hand side is london s fluxoid .",
    "the new term adds additional elements on the diagonal of the inductance matrix : @xmath67/r\\right)+a_c\\left(\\left[x - w/2\\right]/r\\right)}{2 } \\nonumber\\\\          & + \\delta_{ij}\\ , 2\\pi \\mu_0 x \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_l^2}{dw}\\right ) , \\label{eq : mlon}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the kronecker @xmath69-function and @xmath70 is the film thickness .",
    "inversion of the matrix @xmath71 allows determination of the current profile in the vortex .",
    "a two - dimensional solution of the vortex shows that , for the materials parameters we are interested in here , the currents are uniform along the @xmath72 direction to within about 10@xmath73 .",
    "therefore we may simplify the matrix inversion part of the calculation by using 1-d discretization and replacing @xmath74 in eq .",

    "once the currents in the vortex are known , it is straightforward to calculate the in - plane @xmath81 and out - of - plane @xmath82 magnetic fields at all points in space by summing over the contributions @xmath83 of the individual loops of current @xmath27 . for a current loop with radius @xmath84 centered at @xmath85 in the @xmath86 plane",

    "we consider a film with thickness @xmath70 = 80 nm and evaluate the fields on the surface of the film , assuming a uniform current density throughout the thickness of the film . ]",
    "we now consider magnetic coupling between a vortex and a surface spin located at radius @xmath16 .",
    "we first think of the spin as an infinitesimal current loop with effective sensing area @xmath90 . the flux coupled to the spin by the vortex",
    "is thus @xmath91 where @xmath92^{1/2}$ ] is the magnitude of the field at @xmath16 .",
    "note that the geometrical coupling of the spin to the vortex is unity , since the spin is polarized in the direction of the local field .",
    "the mutual inductance of the spin to the vortex is then @xmath93 the flux coupled to the vortex by a spin at @xmath16 with moment @xmath94 is thus @xmath95 the total flux coupled to the vortex by spins with surface density @xmath8 is therefore @xmath96 where we have introduced the effective spin polarization",
    "@xmath97 , defined as @xmath98 from the known current distribution in the vortex we can calculate @xmath97 .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "[ eq : peff ] we are also integrating the current over the thickness of the washer .",
    "because we have a uniform current distribution in @xmath72 , we average the fields over the thickness of the washer .",
    "as the squid is cooled to millikelvin temperatures , a change in temperature yields a change in effective spin polarization in the vortex , which in turn induces a change in flux coupled to each vortex . the total flux change @xmath99 at the squid is obtained by summing over all vortices , taking into account the coupling factor 0.14 .",
    "we find @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the area of the squid washer , and where @xmath102 is the density of vortices in the squid washer . for our field - cool experiments , we have @xmath103 , where @xmath1 is the magnitude of the cooling field . in these experiments ,",
