    "reduced dynamics of open systems plays an important role in various fields such as condensed matter , quantum optics , and quantum electrodynamics@xcite . in order to describe the reduced dynamics , an initial condition is often used where the relevant system is statistically independent from its environment .",
    "the uncorrelated condition was originally used to describe nmr ( nuclear magnetic resonance ) phenomena for systems with weak system - environment interactions@xcite . besides the initial condition , the markovian approximation has been used to describe the relaxation phenomena , which gives the so - called bloch equation@xcite .",
    "completely positive dynamical semigroups have been devised to ascertain decay properties in the markovian process@xcite , imparting contractivity to the open system dynamics . while dynamical semigroups became the starting point for design of quantum information processing@xcite , as experimental techniques developed to observe non - markovian dynamics@xcite , theoretical treatments for such behavior@xcite attracted much attention .",
    "the projection operator methods have provided formulations for initially correlated systems@xcite , but the initial correlations have been frequently ignored@xcite .",
    "the effects of initial system - environment correlations have been discussed regarding quantum measurements@xcite , complete positivity of dynamical maps@xcite , non - markovian dynamics@xcite , linear - response absorption line shapes @xcite , and general theoretical treatments using the projection operator methods@xcite .",
    "especially relevant has been the finding that initial system - environment correlations require extension of the conceptual framework of open system reduced dynamics to include generalization of contractivity @xcite .    the breakdown of contractivity by including initial correlations has been examined by evaluating the time evolution of the trace distance for finite size of environments@xcite , which shows an increase over the initial values .",
    "dajka , luczka , and hnggi compared four different distance measures : the trace ( which is equivalent to hilbert - schmidt ) , bures , hellinger , and quantum jensen - shannon distances , and found that only the trace distance reveals the distance increase for a system that initially correlates with an infinite size of environment@xcite .",
    "however , the correlated state in @xcite requires elaborate preparation by quantum engineering . as a correlated state",
    ", we can consider a gibbs state which includes infinite size of environment .",
    "when we analyze nmr and esr ( electron spin resonance ) experiments , or design quantum information processing for condensed matter , it might be necessary to find the system - environment correlations that are inherent to the matter . a recent study on the transient linear response of a matter system to a suddenly - applied weak external field showed dependence on the initial conditions , correlated gibbs state , and a conventional factorized state where the relevant system and the environment stay in their equilibrium states@xcite .",
    "conversely , one might say that the transient linear response of a matter system is useful to detect the initial correlations .",
    "however , in @xcite , it was difficult to distinguish the effect of initial correlations except for strong system - environment interactions and for intermediate temperatures .",
    "in addition , within this approach , we can not discuss the generalization of contractivity .    in this paper",
    ", we evaluate the time evolution of trace distance for a matter system where a two - level system interacts with an infinite number of bosons as the environmental system .",
    "we consider that the two - level system linearly and adiabatically interacts with the environment , and that a weak external field is suddenly applied to the two - level system .",
    "we show that the trace distance between the time evolution from the gibbs state , @xmath0 , and from an uncorrelated initial condition clearly exhibits effects of initial correlations as an increase in the short time region .",
    "as opposed to @xcite , as an uncorrelated initial condition , we consider the marginal state of the gibbs state , namely @xmath1 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a partial trace over the relevant ( environmental ) system , respectively . by describing an uncorrelated state as the marginal state",
    ", the relevant system interacts with the same environmental features as an average .",
    "we find that the trace distance increases in the short time region even when the system - environment interaction is weak .",
    "this indicates that the local application of a weak external field can cause information inaccessible at an initial time to flow into the relevant system from its infinitely - sized environment included in a gibbs state , and we can monitor it with the trace distance effectively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we provide our formulation to obtain the time evolution of the two - level system which linearly and adiabatically interacts with an infinite number of bosons under a suddenly - applied weak external field .",

    "iii , and the trace distance time evolution from two different initial conditions in sec .",
    "we state conclusions in sec . v.",
    "we consider a matter system which consists of a two - level system and its environment of an infinite number of bosons .",
    "we assume that the system - environment interaction is linear and adiabatic , which causes the pure dephasing phenomena to the two - level system .",

    "we study the transient behavior of a two - level system after a sudden application of an external field .",
