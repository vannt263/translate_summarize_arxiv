    "the aim of the this paper is to obtain a largeness result for the images of quantum representations of mapping class groups in genus at least @xmath7 .",
    "the main motivation is the construction of large families of finite quotients of ( central extensions of the ) mapping class groups by using the strong approximation theorem .",
    "this method furnishes a large supply of finite quotients of mapping class groups outside the realm of symplectic groups .",
    "similar results were obtained independently by masbaum and reid in @xcite .",
    "earlier , looijenga has proved in @xcite that the images of prym representations ( associated to finite abelian groups ) of suitable finite index subgroups of mapping class groups and of subgroups from the johnson filtration are arithmetic groups .",
    "some largeness results in this direction are already known . in @xcite",
    "we showed that the images are infinite and non - abelian ( for all but finitely many explicit cases ) using earlier results of jones who proved in @xcite that the same holds true for the braid group representations factorizing through the temperley - lieb algebra at roots of unity .",
    "masbaum then found in @xcite explicit elements of infinite order in the image .",
    "general arguments concerning lie groups actually show that the image should contain a free non - abelian group .",
    "furthermore , larsen and wang proved ( see @xcite ) that the image of the quantum representations of the mapping class groups at roots of unity of the form @xmath8 , for prime @xmath1 , is dense in the projective unitary group .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    "the authors proved that the images are large in the sense that they contain explicit free non - abelian groups .",
    "now , each image is contained into some unitary group of matrices with cyclotomic integers entries , by @xcite .",
    "the latter group can be embedded as an irreducible higher rank lattice in a semi - simple lie group @xmath9 ( depending on the genus and the order of the roots of unity ) obtained by restriction of scalars . the main result of this paper strengthens the largeness property above by showing that , in general , the image of a quantum representation is zariski dense in the non - compact group @xmath9 .",
    "let us introduce now some terminology . recall that in @xcite the authors defined the tqft functor @xmath10 , for every @xmath11 and a primitive root of unity @xmath12 of order @xmath13 .",
    "these tqft should correspond to the so - called @xmath14-tqft , for even @xmath15 and to the @xmath16-tqft , for odd @xmath15 ( see also @xcite for another @xmath16-tqft ) .",
    "[ qrep ] let @xmath17 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 be a primitive @xmath13-th root of unity .",
    "the quantum representation @xmath18 is the projective representation of the mapping class group associated to the tqft @xmath10 at the root of unity @xmath12 .",
    "we denote therefore by @xmath19 the linear representation of the central extension @xmath20 of the mapping class groups @xmath21 ( of the genus @xmath4 closed orientable surface ) which resolves the projective ambiguity of @xmath18 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath22 will denote the dimension of the space of conformal blocks associated by the tqft @xmath10 to the closed orientable surface of genus @xmath4 .",
    "the unitary tqfts arising usually correspond to the following choices of the root of unity : @xmath23    for prime @xmath1 we denote by @xmath24 the ring of cyclotomic integers @xmath25 $ ] , if @xmath26 and @xmath27 $ ] , if @xmath28 respectively , where @xmath29 is a primitive @xmath15-th root of unity .",
    "the main result of @xcite states that , for every prime @xmath1 , there exists a free @xmath24-lattice @xmath30 in the @xmath31-vector space of conformal blocks associated by the tqft @xmath32 to the genus @xmath4 closed orientable surface and a non - degenerate hermitian @xmath24-valued form on @xmath30 such that ( a central extension of ) the mapping class group preserves @xmath30 and keeps invariant the hermitian form",
    ". therefore the image of the mapping class group consists of unitary matrices ( with respect to the hermitian form ) with entries in @xmath24 . let @xmath33 be the group of all such matrices , up to scalar multiplication . for the sake of simplicity of the exposition we will consider only primes @xmath15 satisfying @xmath34 , from now on .",
    "similar results hold for the remaining primes with only minor modifications .",
    "it is known that @xmath33 is an irreducible lattice in a semi - simple lie group @xmath35 obtained by the so - called restriction of scalars construction from the totally real cyclotomic field @xmath36 to @xmath3 .",
    "specifically , let us denote by @xmath9 the product @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 stands for a set of representatives for the classes of complex valuations @xmath39 of @xmath40 modulo complex conjugacy .",
    "the factor @xmath41 is the special unitary group associated to the hermitian form conjugated by @xmath39 , thus corresponding to some galois conjugate root of unity .",
    "denote also by @xmath42 and @xmath43 the representations @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "in @xcite the authors proved that the restriction of @xmath42 to the universal central extension @xmath46 of @xmath21  which is a subgroup of @xmath20 of index 12  takes values in @xmath47 .",
    "this implies that @xmath48 for @xmath0 and prime @xmath1 .",
    "notice that the @xmath9 is the set of real points of a semi - simple algebraic group @xmath2 defined over @xmath3 .",
    "our main result can be stated now as follows :    [ zd ] suppose that @xmath49 and @xmath1 is prime .",
    "then @xmath50 is a discrete zariski dense subgroup of @xmath9 whose projections onto the simple factors of @xmath9 are topologically dense .",
    "a similar result holds for the @xmath14-tqft .",
    "specifically let @xmath51 where @xmath52 is prime .",
    "according to ( @xcite , 1.5 ) there is an isomorphism of tqfts between @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and hence the projection on the second factor gives us a homomorphism @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore , the image of the tqft representation associated to @xmath56 is finite",
    ". therefore , @xmath57 is a discrete zariski dense subgroup of @xmath58 .",
    "notice that the result holds also for @xmath59 and prime @xmath60 using the modifications from @xcite in the constructions of free non - abelian subgroups in the image .",
    "we skip the details .",
    "we now consider the johnson filtration by the subgroups @xmath61 of the mapping class group @xmath21 of the closed orientable surface of genus @xmath4 , consisting of those elements having a trivial outer action on the @xmath62-th nilpotent quotient of the fundamental group of the surface , for some @xmath63 .",
    "the main application of our density result is the following :    [ fquot ] for every @xmath0 and prime @xmath1 , there exists some homomorphism @xmath64 , whose restriction to @xmath65 is surjective for all large enough primes @xmath6 and all @xmath66 .",
    "in particular , the surjectivity holds also for @xmath20 , the torelli group @xmath67 , the johnson kernel @xmath68 , or any finite index subgroup of @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the pull - back of the central extension @xmath20 on the torelli subgroup @xmath67 is trivial , because the generator of @xmath69 is the pull - back of the generator of @xmath70 , when @xmath0 .",
    "thus @xmath65 embeds into @xmath20 .",
    "the image of the central factor is finite and @xmath71 is of finite index in @xmath72 , according to proposition [ chain3 ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath73 is of finite index in @xmath50 and hence zariski dense in @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , we will use the following version of the strong approximation theorem due to nori ( see ( @xcite , thm.5.4 ) and also @xcite ) : let @xmath74 be a connected linear algebraic group @xmath74 defined over @xmath3 and @xmath75 be a zariski dense subgroup .",
    "assume that @xmath76 is simply connected .",
    "then the completion of @xmath77 with respect to the congruence topology induced from @xmath78 is an open subgroup in the group @xmath79 of points of @xmath74 over the pro - finite completion @xmath80 of @xmath81 .",
    "we now consider the group @xmath82 which satisfies the assumptions of nori s theorem .",
    "if we take @xmath77 to be a finite index subgroup of @xmath50 the strong approximation theorem implies our claim for @xmath83 .",
    "then a classical result due to serre ( see @xcite ) for @xmath84 and extended by vasiu ( see @xcite ) to all reductive linear algebraic groups defined over @xmath3 improves the surjectivity statement to all @xmath66 .",
    "the arithmetic group @xmath85 , for @xmath0 and prime @xmath1 has the congruence property .",
    "this follows from results of tomanov ( see @xcite , main thm .",
    "( a ) ) and prasad and rapinchuk ( see @xcite , thm .",
    "2.(1 ) and thm .",
    "3 ) on the congruence kernel for @xmath3-anisotropic algebraic groups of type @xmath86 , with @xmath87 . in this respect",
    "it would be interesting to construct finite quotients of the residually finite ( see @xcite ) group @xmath20 , other than the quotients of groups of the form @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , @xmath85 is cocompact in @xmath9 , since it is @xmath3-anisotropic , by a classical result of borel and harish - chandra ( see @xcite ) .",
    "[ fquot2 ] for any prime @xmath1 and @xmath0 there exists a homomorphism @xmath88 , whose restriction to a given finite index subgroup of @xmath21 is surjective for all large enough primes @xmath89 and all @xmath66 . here",
    "@xmath35 is the product of the projective unitary groups whose associated special unitary groups occur as factors of @xmath9 .    the image of the center of @xmath20 by the homomorphism @xmath42 is contained in the centralizer of @xmath50 .",
    "the zariski density result above implies that the centralizer is contained in the product of the centers of each simple factor of @xmath9 .",
    "this proves the claim .    1 .",
    "the first construction of finite quotients of mapping class group by this method was given by masbaum in @xcite .",
    "the set of finite quotients of a particular @xmath21 ( with @xmath0 ) provided by theorem [ fquot ] is rather large .",
    "indeed , @xmath90 are finite groups of lie type of arbitrarily large rank . in particular , the alternate group on @xmath91 elements is contained into some @xmath90 , for large enough @xmath15 and @xmath6 , and hence into some finite quotient of @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , every finite group embeds in some finite quotient of the genus @xmath0 mapping class group .",
    "this answers a question of u. hamenstaedt , first settled by masbaum and reid in @xcite .",
    "3 .   in @xcite",
    "we already obtained results showing that a given mapping class group has many more finite quotients than the family of all symplectic groups , as it can be measured by the torsion of their ( essential ) @xmath92-homology groups . 4 .",
    "the number @xmath93 of the non - compact factors in @xmath9 goes to infinity with @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath94 denote the vector space of quasi - homomorphisms of the group @xmath74 , namely of maps @xmath95 for which @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the boundary 2-cocyle .",
    "the quasi - homomorphism @xmath98 is homogeneous if @xmath99 , for every @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "we consider the quotient @xmath102 of @xmath94 by the submodule generated by the bounded quasi - homomorphisms of @xmath74 and the group homomorphisms .",
    "it is well - known ( see @xcite ) that @xmath102 is isomorphic to the kernel of the comparison homomorphism @xmath103 , where @xmath104 denotes the second bounded cohomology group of @xmath74 .",
    "if @xmath105 is an irreducible hermitian symmetric space of non - compact type and @xmath106 its isometry group , then denote by @xmath107 the generator of the continuous bounded second cohomology group @xmath108 of @xmath106 .",
    "this class is defined , for instance , by the dupont cocycle @xmath109 , given by : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the khler form on @xmath105 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 denotes an oriented smooth triangle on @xmath105 with geodesic sides .",
    "although the interior of the triangle with geodesic sides is not uniquely defined the value of the cocycle is well - defined because @xmath111 is closed ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "it is also known that the class of @xmath114 in the continuous second cohomology group @xmath115 is a generator .",
    "bestvina and fujiwara proved in @xcite that @xmath116 is infinitely generated .",
    "quantum representations yield an explicit family of quasi - homomorphisms on the mapping class groups generalizing the rademacher function on @xmath117 ( which can be obtained for the one - holed torus ) , as follows :    [ quasi ] let @xmath0 , @xmath1 be a prime number and @xmath118 be a non - compact simple factor of @xmath119 corresponding to the primitive root of unity @xmath12 . let @xmath120 be the universal central extension of @xmath21 .",
    "then there exists a unique quasi - homomorphism @xmath121 verifying @xmath122 furthermore , the classes of those @xmath123 , for which @xmath124 , are linearly independent over @xmath3 in @xmath125 .",
    "burger and iozzi proved in ( @xcite , thm 1.3 ) that for each set of pairwise non - equivalent ( i.e. not conjugate by an isometry of the corresponding symmetric spaces ) zariski dense representations @xmath126 , of a finitely generated group @xmath127 , for which @xmath128 , the elements @xmath129 are linearly independent over @xmath81 . on the other hand @xmath130",
    "because @xmath131 is a universal central extension and hence it does not have any non - trivial central extension .",
    "therefore , the cocycle @xmath132 corresponds to an element of @xmath116 and the corollary follows from the above cited result in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath133 is some zariski dense representation and @xmath134 is the corresponding quasi - homomorphism , then @xmath135 in @xmath116 only if @xmath136 is conjugate to @xmath19 ( see @xcite ) . moreover , let @xmath137 denote the unique homogeneous quasi - homomorphism in the class of @xmath123 . then @xmath137 is a class function ( i.e. invariant on conjugacy classes ) on @xmath46 which encodes all information about the representation @xmath19 .    if the groups @xmath72 were finitely presented and the number of relations in some group presentation were uniformly bounded ( for fixed @xmath4 ) , then the rank of @xmath138 would also be uniformly bounded and our density theorem would imply that @xmath139 can not be trivial for large enough @xmath15 .",
    "for instance the uniform bound holds if we replace @xmath140 above by the subgroup generated by @xmath15-th powers of all dehn twists and one might conjecture that the two subgroups coincide in genus @xmath0 . eventually ,",
    "if @xmath139 were infinite dimensional then @xmath72 would not be boundedly generated .",
    "recall now the following recent result due to salehi golsefidy and varj ( see @xcite , thm . 1 and cor .",
    "5 ) : let @xmath141 be a group generated by a symmetric set @xmath142 and denote by @xmath143 the reduction mod @xmath6 .",
    "then the family of cayley graphs of the groups @xmath144 with generator systems @xmath145 forms a family of expanders ( see @xcite for details about expanders ) , where @xmath6 runs through square - free integers , if and only if the connected component of the zariski closure of @xmath127 is perfect .",
    "this family of cayley graphs forms expanders iff @xmath127 has property @xmath146 with respect to the family of finite quotients @xmath144 , where @xmath6 runs through square - free integers , namely if there exists some @xmath147 ( depending on @xmath142 ) such that for every unitary representation @xmath148 of @xmath127 into some hilbert space @xmath149 factorizing through some @xmath144 without invariant nontrivial vector and every unit vector @xmath150 we have @xmath151 , for some @xmath152 . here",

    "observe now that the ( complex ) zariski closure of @xmath118 in @xmath154 is @xmath155 .",
    "in particular , our density result implies that the zariski closure of @xmath50 ( within the appropiate product of copies of @xmath156 ) is the complex zariski closure of @xmath2 , namely the product of several copies of @xmath157 .",
    "since the zariski closure is perfect then by ( @xcite , thm.1 , but cor.5 would also suffice ) we obtain the following :    [ tau ] for every prime @xmath1 , the groups @xmath50 ( and @xmath158 , @xmath159 ) have property @xmath146 with respect to the family of finite quotients induced by @xmath160 , where @xmath6 runs through square - free integers .",
    "bourgain and gamburd proved ( see @xcite ) that a dense subgroup of @xmath161 generated by matrices with algebraic entries , and in particular @xmath50 , has a spectral gap with respect to the natural action on @xmath162 .    on the other hand these results can not be considered as evidence in the favor of the claim that @xmath50 has property @xmath146 with respect to the family of _ all _ its finite quotients .",
    "in fact , by @xcite there exists a free subgroup on two generators @xmath163 which is zariski dense in @xmath9 .",
    "although a free group has not property @xmath146 with respect to all its finite quotients , the group @xmath164 has property @xmath146 with respect to the family of finite quotients induced by @xmath160 , where @xmath6 runs through square - free integers , by the result from @xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to find whether @xmath20 has property @xmath146 with respect to the family of finite quotients @xmath165 , where @xmath166 are sufficiently large , possibly square - free and @xmath15 runs over the primes .",

    "the starting point is the following result from @xcite , subsequently improved in @xcite :    [ lw ] if @xmath167 , @xmath1 is prime and @xmath168 , then @xmath169 is ( topologically ) dense in @xmath170 , where @xmath22 is the dimension of the space of conformal blocks associated to the closed orientable surface @xmath171 of genus @xmath4 .",
    "a cautionary remark is in order .",

    "however , the proof from @xcite , although stated for one version , works also for the other version of the tqft .    the hermitian form @xmath149 associated to the tqft @xmath172 and the root of unity @xmath12 has signature @xmath173 , where @xmath174 .",
    "we prove first :    [ weakzd ] let @xmath0 and @xmath12 be any primitive @xmath13-th root of unity . then @xmath175 is ( topologically ) dense in @xmath176 .",
    "two representations into the same group @xmath74 are called equivalent if there exists an isomorphism of @xmath74 which intertwines them .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath177 and therefore @xmath19 and @xmath178 are equivalent .",
    "the converse is provided by the following :    [ inequivalent ] let @xmath0 , @xmath12 and @xmath179 be distinct primitive @xmath13-th roots of unity .",

    "in particular , if all representations @xmath189 of @xmath127 are pairwise inequivalent , then @xmath198 .",
    "we then have the following hall lemma from @xcite :    let @xmath127 be a subgroup of the product @xmath199 of the adjoint simple ( i.e. connected , without center and whose lie algebra is simple ) lie groups @xmath189 .",
    "assume that the projection of @xmath127 on each factor @xmath189 is zariski dense .",
    "then the zariski closure of @xmath127 in @xmath199 is a @xmath127-diagonal subgroup .",
    "therefore , the hall lemma above shows that the zariski closure of @xmath72 is all of @xmath35 .",
    "now using ( @xcite , lemma 3.6 ) we obtain that @xmath50 is zariski dense in @xmath9 .",
