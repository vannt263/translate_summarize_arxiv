    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is currently one of the most valuable tools of cosmology , providing with a great wealth of information about the universe .",
    "a particularly interesting subject is whether the cmb temperature fluctuations follow or not a gaussian distribution .",
    "this is a key issue since gaussian fluctuations are predicted by the standard inflationary theory , whereas alternative theories produce non - gaussian signatures in the cmb . in addition , foregrounds and systematics may also introduce non - gaussianity , which should be carefully studied in order to avoid its misidentification with intrinsic non - gaussian fluctuations .",
    "a large effort has been recently devoted to the study of the gaussian character of the cmb using the multi - frequency all - sky cmb data provided by the wmap satellite of nasa ( bennett et al .",
    "2003a ) , finding , in some cases , unexpected results .",
    "some authors have found that the wmap data are consistent with gaussianity using different types of analysis ( komatsu et al . 2003 , colley & gott 2003 , gaztaaga & wagg 2003 , gaztaaga et al . 2003 ) .",
    "however , other studies have produced a positive detection of non - gaussianity and/or have shown north - south asymmetries ( chiang et al .",
    "2003 , eriksen et al .",
    "2004a , b , park 2004 , copi et al .",

    "2004 , larson & wandelt 2004 , mcewen et al .",
    "2004 , cruz et al . 2005 ) .",
    "although some of these results could be explained by the presence of foreground contamination , in other cases the origin of the detection is uncertain and a primordial origin can not be discarded .",
    "these results motivates , even more , the development of novel techniques to perform further gaussianity analyses of the cmb .    in this paper we have focused on the study of several scalar quantities constructed from the derivatives of the cmb field on the sphere . in particular , we have considered the modulus of the gradient , the laplacian , the distortion , the shear , the ellipticity , the shape index , the eigenvalues of the negative hessian matrix , the gaussian curvature and the derivative of the squared modulus of the gradient . a procedure to calculate the scalars directly from the @xmath0 harmonic coefficients is provided .",
    "in addition , we have obtained expressions for the probability distributions of the previous quantities for the case of a homogeneous and isotropic gaussian random field ( higrf ) , which depend on the power spectrum of the initial field . in order to remove this dependence ,",
    "we have also constructed a new set of _ normalized scalars _ whose probability distribution is independent of the power spectrum .    a number of works have been already devoted to the study of some of these or other related quantities .",
    "also , some of them have been applied to study the gaussianity of the wmap data , providing interesting results . in a pioneering work ,",
    "bond & efstathiou ( 1987 ) studied different statistical properties of the cmb , assuming a 2-dimensional gaussian field , which included the number densities of hot and cold spots , the eccentricities of peaks and peak correlation properties .",
    "barreiro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) studied also the mean number of maxima and the probability distribution of the gaussian curvature and the eccentricity of peaks of the cmb for different shapes of the power spectra .",
    "wandelt , hivon & grski ( 1998 ) developed efficient algorithms for fast extrema search as well as for the simulation of the gradient vector and the curvature tensor fields on the sphere associated to the temperature field .",
    "the power to detect non - gaussianity in the cmb of the number , eccentricity and gaussian curvature of excursion sets above ( and below ) a threshold was tested by barreiro , martnez - gonzlez & sanz ( 2001 ) using gaussian and non - gaussian simulations , finding that the gaussian curvature was the best discriminator .",
    "dor , colombi & bouchet ( 2003 ) tested the power of a technique based on the proportion of hill , lake and saddle points ( which are defined attending to their local curvature ) on flat patches of the sky .",
    "a study of the ellipticity of the cmb was performed for the cobe - dmr ( gurzadyan & torres 1997 ) and boomerang data ( gurzadyan et al . 2003 ) , which seemed to indicate a slight excess of ellipticity for the largest spots with respect to what was expected in the standard model .",
    "these results were recently confirmed by repeating the analysis on the wmap data using the same region of the sky observed by boomerang ( gurzadyan et al .",
    "eriksen et al .",
    "( 2004b ) applied the minkowski functionals and the length of the skeleton ( novikov , colombi & dor 2003 ) to the wmap data finding evidence of non - gaussianity and asymmetry between the northern and southern hemispheres .",
    "the length of the skeleton is a quantity defined in terms of the first and second derivatives of the field and the previous work provided with an algorithm to calculate it on the sphere for a cmb map in healpix pixelization .",
    "hansen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found north / south asymmetries on the wmap data using the local curvature , which were consistent with the results of eriksen et al .",
    "( 2004b ) . finally , cabella et al . (",
    "2004 ) used a method based on the local curvature to constrain the value of the non - linear coupling constant @xmath1 from the wmap data .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "in @xmath22 we introduce the different considered scalars and describe how to calculate them from the covariant derivatives of a 2d field and , in particular , for spherical coordinates . in @xmath23 we obtain analytical ( or semi - analytical ) expressions for the probability density function ( pdf ) of the considered scalars for a homogeneous and isotropic gaussian field on the sphere . in @xmath24 we construct a new set of related scalars which are independent of the power spectrum of the field and we obtain their theoretical distribution functions for the gaussian case . the theoretical results are also compared with cmb simulations .",

    "we will assume @xmath16 .",
    "taking into account the values of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , we can distinguish among three type of points ( e. g. dor et al .",

    "we present some of these scalars as function of the covariant derivatives",
    ". we will also relate them to the former defined quantities for the spherical case .",
    "note that , although we are considering the spherical case , the expressions given for the scalars as a function of the covariant derivatives are valid for any 2-dimensional surface .",
    "in particular , if observing a small portion of the sky , we can assume that we have a flat patch . in this case , the scalars can be easily obtained taking into account that all the christoffel symbols are zero .",

    "we also show how to obtain the probability density function of the normalised scalars from that of the original scalars . as an illustration ,",
    "we focus on the normalised ellipticity and determinant , but similar calculations are needed to obtain the pdf s of the rest of the scalars .",
    "as explained in section  [ derivatives_scalars ] , ordinary scalars can be constructed in terms of the gaussian variables @xmath192 given in equations ( [ eq : xtheta ] ) to ( [ eq : x3 ] ) . in particular , the ellipticity can be rewritten as : @xmath193 let us define the uncorrelated gaussian variables @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath92 and @xmath194 . in terms of these new variables ,",
    "the ellipticity is given by @xmath195 since s , t and r are independent variables , the numerator and the denominator are also independent .",
    "the numerator is the square root of the addition of the square of two gaussian uncorrelated variables with the same dispersion @xmath196 .",
    "therefore the numerator , @xmath197 , should follow a rayleigh distribution : @xmath198 where @xmath199 .",
    "the denominator is gaussian distributed with zero mean and @xmath200 dispersion . performing a change of variable",
    "we can obtain the pdf of the inverse of the denominator @xmath201 : @xmath202 where @xmath203 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath204 and @xmath197 are independent , we have : @xmath205 since we need to calculate the pdf of @xmath206 , we perform a change of variables @xmath207 and then , integrating over z ( note that @xmath199 ) , we obtain the distribution function of the ellipticity given in equation ( [ eq : pdf_ellipticity ] ) .    the normalised ellipticity is proportional to the ordinary ellipticity , @xmath208 , and , therefore , the pdf of @xmath209 can be trivially obtained from @xmath210 by a simple change of variables : @xmath211 the preceding expresion leads to equation ( [ eq : norm_ellipticity_pdf ] ) .",
    "the same applies for all the normalised scalars which are proportional to the ordinary ones .    however , some normalised scalars are related to the ordinary ones in a more complex way . to construct their pdf s",
    "it is convenient , whenever possible , to rewrite them in terms of @xmath212 and @xmath213 , since these two normalised scalars are independent .",
    "this can be proved using the property @xmath214 , already mentioned in section  [ gaussian_case ] , where @xmath215 denotes the pdf of @xmath216 .",
    "as an example , we show how to calculate the probability density function of the normalised determinant , @xmath217 , which can be expressed as : @xmath218\\ ] ] using the probability distribution function of @xmath212 and @xmath213 , ( equations  [ eq : pdf_normalised_lambda_+ ] ) and  [ eq : pdf_normalised_lambda_- ] ) and by performing different changes of variables , we can obtain the distribution function of the normalised determinant .",
    "first we calculate the pdf of the @xmath219 and @xmath220 , which are given by : @xmath221 @xmath222 where @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
    "since @xmath212 and @xmath213 are independent , @xmath225 and @xmath226 are also independent , therefore @xmath227 we perform then a change of variables @xmath228 , where @xmath229 . finally , integrating over @xmath225 we obtain the pdf of the normalised determinant @xmath217 given in equation ( [ eq : pdf_normalised_det_a ] ) .",
    "the normalised eigenvalues can also be rewritten in terms of @xmath212 and @xmath213 , through the following expression : @xmath230 therefore , throught a straightforward change of variables , the pdf of the normalised eigenvalues can be obtained from those of @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "the pdf s of the remaining normalised scalars can be constructed in an analogous way , since they can be trivially written either in terms of @xmath212 and @xmath213 or of the other normalised scalars ."
