    "cl 1358 + 6245 is one of the richest medium redshift galaxy clusters known ( see luppino et al .",
    "the cluster was originally selected from the _ einstein _ medium sensitivity survey ( gioia et al .",
    "1990 , gioia & luppino 1994 ) by fabricant , mcclintock & bautz ( 1991 , hereafter fmb ) on the basis of its large x - ray luminosity : @xmath14@xmath127@xmath1 10@xmath15 ergs s@xmath7 ( 0.2 - 4.5 kev ) .",
    "the fmb study used x - ray selection to avoid possible biases associated with optical selection ( see koo 1988 ) , although they established that the galaxy populations of x - ray selected clusters at intermediate redshifts are similar to those in optically selected clusters .    here , we present a much expanded spectroscopic study of the cluster based on new data obtained at the william herschel telescope ( wht ) with the low dispersion survey spectrograph ( ldss-2 ) .",
    "we obtained redshifts of 328 additional galaxies , 173 of which are cluster members .",
    "the spectra are of sufficient quality to determine the main characteristics of the stellar populations in the cluster galaxies from line strength measurements of emission and absorption features .",
    "we use the spectroscopic data to explore the cluster dynamics and the evolution of its galaxy population .",
    "the work reported here is part of a larger study of the evolution of x - ray selected clusters at increasing redshift , combining ground - based spectroscopy and photometry with hst wfpc2 images .",
    "there is now substantial evidence that galaxy populations in distant clusters differ from the populations in nearby clusters .",
    "butcher & oemler ( 1978 , 1984 ) demonstrated that the fraction of blue galaxies in clusters increases from about 3% in nearby clusters to 25% at @xmath0@xmath120.5 .",
    "spectra of these blue galaxies revealed both emission - line galaxies , and surprisingly , poststarburst galaxies with strong balmer absorption lines ( dressler & gunn 1983 ) .",
    "the poststarburst galaxies ( often called `` e+a '' galaxies ) are believed to have experienced a burst of star formation that ended approximately 1 gyr before the epoch of observation .",
    "previous studies have suggested that the emission - line and poststarburst galaxies are found preferentially in the outer regions of clusters ( e.g. , couch & sharples 1987 ; fmb ; colless & dunn 1996 ; abraham et al .",
    "a goal of our current program is to map the distribution of the spectroscopically active galaxies to help constrain their evolutionary history .",
    "hst studies will reveal the morphology of these distant galaxies , and will add important evolutionary constraints , but ground - based spectroscopy of the type we report here remains essential to our progress in this field .",
    "in addition to studying the evolution of cluster galaxies , we wish to address the evolution of clusters as dynamical systems . simulations ( reviewed in evrard 1993 ) suggest that in bottom - up hierarchical clustering models , many generations of subcluster merging are likely to have occurred in rich clusters by the present epoch .",
    "furthermore , these models predict that the accretion of galaxies into the cluster and the frequency of localized velocity structures should increase as a function of lookback time ( gunn & gott 1972 ) .",
    "large numbers of redshifts are needed to determine the degree of dynamical mixing within a cluster and observations at the current epoch have yielded important tests of these models of cluster formation .",
    "observations at intermediate redshift have only recently become available ( e.g. , carlberg 1994 ) and are of particular importance because they can be used to directly search for dynamical evolution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we describe the photometric catalog (  2 ) from which we selected objects for spectroscopy .",
    "the design of the multislit aperture masks used to obtain the spectroscopy , spectroscopic reduction techniques , and determination of radial velocities are discussed in  3 .",
    "the spectroscopic catalog is presented in  4 including a description of the completeness of the spectroscopic sample and the definition of the line strength indices used to classify the galaxy spectra . in  5 ,",
    "we discuss the spectral types observed in our galaxy sample .",
    "the changing mix of spectral types as a function of local galaxy density or distance from the cluster center and the dependence of the galaxy velocity distribution on spectral type are discussed in  6 . our search for subclustering",
    "is discussed in  7 .",
    "a summary of our findings is presented in section  8 .",
    "in 1992 we obtained @xmath16 and @xmath17 images of cl 1358 + 62 at the fred l.  whipple observatory s 1.2-m telescope , covering the central 10  @xmath1 11  portion of the cluster .",
    "multiple exposures in @xmath16 and @xmath17 were obtained with small spatial offsets between exposures .",
    "the observations consist of three 900 sec @xmath17 exposures and five 1200 sec @xmath16 exposures .",
    "we used a ford 2048@xmath12048 pixel ccd with a scale of 0.325  pixel@xmath7 .",
    "the seeing was 1.2  during the run and conditions were not photometric so we normalized to the fmb zeropoints for @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the images were reduced in the standard fashion to create a master frame for each run and each filter .",
    "we used the faint object classification and analysis system ( jarvis & tyson 1981 ; valdes 1982a , b , hereafter focas ) to extract aperture photometry , positions and object classifications ( galaxy , star , defect ) .",
    "we used 10 pixel diameter ( 3.25 ) apertures for the data , close to the 3.3  apertures that fmb used . at the distance of cl 1358 + 62",
    ", 3.3  corresponds to 19 kpc ( for consistency with fmb we assume h@xmath18=50 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 and q@xmath18=1/2 throughout ) .",
    "the expected reddening towards cl 1358 + 62 is small [ e(@xmath19)=0.01 ] and so no corrections have been made for galactic reddening ( burstein & heiles 1984 ) .",
    "the photometric catalog resulting from these images was used to select objects for our spectroscopic runs .    in 1994",
    ", we obtained additional @xmath16 and @xmath17 images with the wht ldss-2 spectrograph ( operated as a focal reducer ) that cover an approximately circular region of 8  diameter slightly offset from the cluster center .",
    "the ldss-2 detector was a 1024@xmath11024 tektronix ccd with a scale of 0.592  pixel@xmath7 .",
    "the wht observations consist of seven 300 sec @xmath17 exposures and two 300 sec @xmath16 exposures .",
    "the seeing was 1.6  during the run and flux standards were not observed so we extracted counts in @xmath123.3  apertures and normalized to the fmb zeropoints .",
    "the ldss-2 images are rather coarsely sampled , but are deeper than the whipple 1.2-m images .",
    "aperture photometry in 6 pixel diameter ( 3.55 ) apertures was extracted from the reduced images with the focas package .",
    "the @xmath20 object colors presented here are drawn from this wht catalog .",
    "we can estimate the completeness of the wht photometry by examining the distribution of galaxy counts as a function of magnitude well away from the cluster core .",
    "we find that log n@xmath21@xmath22 for 20@xmath2323.5 .",
    "the counts in the 23.5@xmath2324 bin fall 20% below this relation and the counts in the 24@xmath2324.5 are over a factor of two below the relation .",
    "we therefore expect that the wht photometry is substantially complete to @xmath2423.5 .",
    "there are two areas of local incompleteness surrounding two stars that saturated the ccd : one of radius @xmath1250@xmath25 at 13@xmath26 58@xmath27 21.0@xmath28 , 62@xmath29 50@xmath30 23@xmath25 ( 1950 ) and one of radius @xmath1220@xmath25 at 13@xmath26 58@xmath27 52.1@xmath28 , 62@xmath29 44@xmath30 56@xmath25 ( 1950 ) .",
    "a multi - color mosaic of hst wfpc2 images of cl 1358 has been obtained .",
    "this mosaic offers an unprecedented high resolution view of a large area of a cluster at intermediate redshift .",
    "we refer the reader to a companion paper ( van dokkum et al .",
    "1997 ) , which uses these hst images to study the galaxy morphologies and color - magnitude relation in the cluster .",
    "the new spectra were obtained during two observing runs with the ldss-2 spectrograph at the wht : a 3 night run in april 1994 and a 5 night run in june 1996 .",
    "the ldss-2 is a multi - slit spectrograph with an 11  @xmath111  field of view that is mounted at the cassegrain focus of the wht ( see allington - smith et al .",
    "the aperture plates used for our two runs contained slitlets 1.5  wide and @xmath1215  long .",
    "the masks used for the first wht run each contained @xmath1230 slitlets ; the masks for the second run each contained @xmath1250 slitlets .      the design of aperture plates for the mmt is described in fmb .",
    "fmb obtained spectra for 70 galaxies within @xmath31 ( @xmath122 ) of the dominant central cluster galaxy , yielding 59 redshifts of cluster members .",
    "for the first wht spectroscopic run galaxies with @xmath32 21 were given highest priority .",
    "nine masks were designed with an optimizer which attempted to maximize the assignment of high priority galaxies .",
    "fainter galaxies were assigned priorities proportional to their magnitude and were used to fill the remaining spaces in the masks . observing time was available to expose six of the nine masks , yielding spectra of 127 high priority galaxies and 35 lower priority galaxies .",
    "similar galaxy priorities were assigned for the second wht run except that objects falling outside the hst mosaic ( 8@xmath1 8) were assigned the lowest priority independent of their magnitude .",
    "the automated selection procedure was used to design nine masks and all nine aperture plates were exposed .",
    "spectra for 42 galaxies with @xmath32 21 and 172 fainter galaxies were obtained .      for the 1994 wht run and the first 2 nights of the 1996 wht run",
    ", we used a tektronix 1024@xmath11024 ccd with 24 @xmath33 m pixels with a pixel scale of 0.59  pixel@xmath7 . for the last 3 nights of the 1996 wht run we used a loral 2048@xmath12048 ccd with 15 @xmath33 m pixels and a spatial scale of 0.37  pixel@xmath7",
    "the read out noise and gain of the tektronic chip was 4.4 e@xmath34 and 1.2 e@xmath34/adu respectively , while that of the loral chip was 6 e@xmath34 and 0.8 e@xmath34/adu .",
    "exposure times were 4@xmath11800 sec for the tektronic chip and 3@xmath12400 sec for the loral with each aperture plate .",
    "the 300 line mm@xmath7 grism blazed at 5000   was used for all observations , providing a resolution of 13   fwhm with the aperture plates .",
    "the dispersion was 5.3   pixel@xmath7 with the tektronix ccd and 3.3   pixel@xmath7 with the loral ccd .",
    "the wavelength coverage depends on the layout of the aperture mask but typically includes the range 3500 - 8500  .",
    "this wide wavelength coverage is beneficial for the identification of field galaxies to @xmath351 . in the cluster rest frame",
    "our coverage extends from well below the [ oii ] 3727  emission line to well beyond the mg i triplet at 5175 .",
    "data reduction for the 1994 wht run was carried out with iraf while reduction of the 1996 wht run was carried out with vista ( lauer , stover , & terndrup 1983 ) . in brief , the processing steps for each ccd exposure were : bias subtraction , flat - fielding , wavelength calibration and geometrical rectification . following this ,",
    "cosmic ray events were removed and the individual spectra were extracted .",
    "one - dimensional spectra , binned logarithmically in the wavelength direction , were the final product of these procedures .",
    "flux standards were not obtained , so flux calibration was not attempted .",
    "the identification and removal of cosmic ray events is a critical step in the reduction process because they can be confused with emission lines .",
    "we generated a cosmic ray map for each frame by subtracting a median of the multiple exposures of each mask from the individual exposures and setting to zero all pixels less than 5@xmath9 above the median level .",
    "following subtraction of the cosmic ray map , each frame was visually inspected for remaining deviant pixels before combining it with the other exposures .",
    "straight medians of the individual exposures were created to aid the separation of cosmic ray events from emission lines in ambiguous cases .",
    "the major difference between the reduction procedures for the two runs was that the wavelength calibration was performed after extraction of one dimensional spectra for the 1994 data , while it was performed prior to extraction for the 1996 data .",
    "the results of both procedures are essentially indistinguishable .",
    "cuar spectra were obtained with each aperture plate to determine the wavelength solutions for each slitlet .",
    "wavelength calibration for each slitlet was performed using a fifth - order polynomial fit to @xmath1215 - 20 arc spectrum lines .",
    "the rms residuals from these fits are @xmath360.2  . as a final step in the wavelength calibration",
    "the position of the 5577   night skyline was measured and used to correct for any offset to the wavelength solution caused by relative shifts between the arc and galaxy exposures .",
    "this correction was usually of order 1   or less .",
    "we estimate that residual errors in the final wavelength - calibrated and line curvature - corrected spectra are present at the level of @xmath360.5 , as determined from measurements of the positions of prominent spectral features . by themselves",
    ", these errors can result in redshift uncertainties of @xmath1228 km s@xmath7 or @xmath37(@xmath0)@xmath380.00009 .",
    "we discuss our estimated external errors below .",
    "redshifts were derived from either the absorption lines using a cross - correlation technique ( tonry & davis 1979 ) or directly from the emission lines .",
    "these techniques are similar to those used by fmb .",
    "the subsections below describe the details of the derivations of radial velocities for the cluster members .",
    "redshifts were determined by cross - correlating template spectra with cluster galaxy spectra for the 188 ( 177 red absorption - line galaxies @xmath39 11 poststarburst galaxies ) galaxies with wht spectra dominated by stellar absorption features .",
    "two high signal - to - noise template spectra were used : a spectrum of the central regions of the early - type galaxy ngc 7331 and a spectrum of a poststarburst galaxy in the cluster ( number 209 ) .",
    "a semiautomated procedure was developed to cross - correlate the object spectra with the templates using the cross - correlation routine , xcsao .",
    "xcsao ( kurtz et al .  1992 ) is part of the rvsao package for the iraf environment .",
    "the velocities and their errors are returned by the xcsao software .",
    "each object spectrum was cross - correlated with the each of the two templates within the 3530@xmath405110  rest frame wavelength range .",
    "the 14 galaxies from the fmb study which were reobserved with the wht allow us to estimate the external errors .",
    "the rms velocity difference between the fmb and the new wht results is @xmath12100 km s@xmath7 , yielding an estimated uncertainty of @xmath1270 km s@xmath7 for an individual measurement if the mmt and wht errors are equal .",
    "in fact , the wht have higher resolution and ( in general ) higher signal - to - noise .",
    "we therefore assign an error of 60 km s@xmath7 to the highest quality wht spectra and 80 km s@xmath7 to the highest quality mmt spectra .",
    "we estimate that the errors in the lower quality mmt spectra are 120 km s@xmath7 .",
    "this comparison of the fmb and wht redshifts suggests that fmb significantly overestimated their errors .",
    "the sky subtracted two - dimensional slitlet frames and one - dimensional object spectra were inspected for emission features and they were detected in 44 galaxies . for these galaxies redshifts were often determined solely from the [ oii ] 3727 , although in some cases additional lines ( usually [ oiii ] 5007  and h@xmath4 ) were present . the emission line positions and their associated errors were measured by fitting a gaussian profile with the iraf splot task .",
    "eight of the galaxy spectra in our catalog have redshifts determined from both absorption and emission lines .",
    "the largest difference between the emission - line and absorption - line derived radial velocities for the eight galaxies is 143 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the rms velocity difference for the eight galaxies is 53 km s@xmath7 , which implies an internal error in the wht velocity determinations of @xmath1240 km s@xmath7 .",
    "cluster membership was defined to include all galaxies within the redshift interval 0.31461 @xmath8 @xmath0 @xmath8 0.34201 .",
    "this corresponds to the 4@xmath41 boundary around the cluster mean .",
    "the nearest galaxies in redshift space outside these boundaries are at @xmath394.5@xmath41 and @xmath395.9@xmath41 . both these galaxies are also at large projected distance from the cluster center ( 260 , 1.5 mpc and 310 , 1.8 mpc respectively ) and are therefore not likely to be cluster members .",
    "table 1 presents our results for the full sample of 232 cluster members including the fmb results .",
    "the galaxy ( @xmath42,@xmath43 ) positions are given with respect to the brightest cluster galaxy ( number 375 at r.a .",
    "( 1950 ) 13@xmath2658@xmath2720@xmath28.7 dec  ( 1950 ) 62@xmath4445@xmath3033@xmath25 ) with positive @xmath42 towards the west and positive @xmath43 to the north .",
    "the three major selection effects which could influence the completeness of our survey are uneven spatial sampling , a magnitude bias , and a color or spectral type bias .",
    "a spatial sampling bias could result from an uneven distribution of the aperture plate slitlets .",
    "a magnitude bias naturally arises because redshifts are more difficult to measure for faint galaxies .",
    "completeness may depend on the galaxy colors or spectral types because redshifts are generally easier to measure for galaxies with emission lines .",
    "( see , e.g. , yee , ellingson , & carlberg 1996 ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of all galaxies from the 1.2 m photometric catalog with @xmath17@xmath4521 is plotted in figure 1 .",
    "the subset of galaxies for which we have measured redshifts have been marked .",
    "the region covered by the spectroscopy is outlined , i.e. , @xmath405@xmath36 @xmath42 @xmath36@xmath395  and @xmath406@xmath36 @xmath43 @xmath36@xmath395 . of the 226 galaxies in this field with r@xmath4521 , we have obtained redshifts for 189 ( 84% ) .",
    "there are 154 galaxies with @xmath17@xmath4521 in the inner half of the spectroscopic field ( by area ) , and we obtained redshifts for 138 ( 90% ) .",
    "the outer half of our field ( by area ) contains 72 galaxies for which we acquired 51 redshifts ( 71% ) .",
    "the completeness of our spectroscopic sample as a function of magnitude is shown in figure 2 .",
    "2 plots the ratio of the number of galaxies ( including cluster and field galaxies ) with measured redshifts to the total number of galaxies in the photometric catalog in a magnitude bin centered on each galaxy .",
    "we used a magnitude bin of @xmath50.50 for @xmath17@xmath4520 and a magnitude bin of @xmath50.25 for fainter objects .",
    "those objects brighter than the brightest cluster galaxy ( at @xmath17=19.09 ) are foreground galaxies .",
    "2 indicates that our spectroscopic sample is @xmath1380% complete for @xmath17@xmath4521 and drops steeply to 20% completeness at r@xmath1222 .    to check",
    "if our ability to measure redshifts depends on color , we divided our sample into red ( @xmath20@xmath130.75 ) and blue ( @xmath20@xmath80.75 ) samples .",
    "we find that we are 100% successful in determining redshifts for objects with @xmath17@xmath821 , and at r@xmath1223 the success ratio drops to 50% .",
    "the success ratio does not depend strongly on color for r@xmath823.5 . at fainter magnitudes the statistics are poor : we detect 1 of 6 targeted blue galaxies and 2 of 4 targeted red galaxies .",
    "we conclude that any color biases ( and by inference spectral type biases ) in our catalog are minor .",
    "the resolution and limited signal - to - noise ratio of our spectra prevent us from studying subtle spectral features .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on the most prominent spectral lines that measure star formation activity : the balmer absorption lines ( h@xmath2 , h@xmath3 , and h@xmath4 ) , and the [ oii ] 3727  emission line .",
    "three wavelength regions need to be defined in order to measure a spectral index : an interval covering the feature of interest , and a pair of continuum bandpasses on either side of the feature .",
    "the strength of each spectral index is a measure of the flux in the central bandpass compared to a continuum level set by the sidebands .",
    "the indices we measure here are tabulated as equivalent widths in @xmath46 .",
    "these equivalent width ( ew ) measurements using the observed spectra are corrected into the rest frame by dividing by ( 1+@xmath0 ) .",
    "the line strength indices that we use are defined in table 2 .",
    "the h@xmath2 , h@xmath3 , and h@xmath4 indices are based on jones & worthey ( 1995 ) but we have broadened the continuum sidebands and moved them further from the central bandpass .",
    "we have moved the jones & worthey balmer sidebands because their sidebands overlap the absorption lines for poststarburst galaxies .",
    "figure 3 shows the spectrum of our strongest poststarburst galaxy ( number 243 ) with our balmer line index definitions overlaid .",
    "the jones & worthy balmer indices are located @xmath1220 - 30   closer to the feature bandpasses on both sides , and fall inside the features being measured .",
    "we have , however , used the wavelength regions of jones & worthey for the central bandpasses because 95% of the cluster galaxies are _ not _ poststarburst and wider feature bandpasses for these galaxies would include unwanted regions of the spectrum in addition to the balmer lines .",
    "conversely , for the strongest poststarburst galaxies , the jones & worthey central bandpasses are too narrow to include the full widths of the balmer lines , leading to up to 30% underestimates of the true equivalent widths . as an example , the poststarburst galaxy shown in fig .",
    "3 has an average balmer line strength of 9.1  in our system whereas a measurement including the full line widths gives 12.0 . for the purposes of spectral classifications our system provides a rigorous means of measuring the balmer line strengths for the wide range of galaxy spectra found in cl 1358 + 62 .",
    "we also define our own [ oii ] emission - line index which we give in table 2 .",
    "the equivalent widths that we measure for all galaxies are given in table 1 .",
    "errors are calculated by measuring the noise in the continuum sidebands and scaling this to the indices themselves .",
    "our spectra display a wide variety of nebular emission line and absorption line strengths .",
    "the galaxy spectra can be sorted into spectral classes which are directly related to the star formation histories of the galaxies .",
    "we have divided the cluster galaxy spectra into three spectral types : ( 1 ) a population displaying the normal absorption features of elliptical and s0 galaxies and no emission lines , ( 2 ) poststarburst galaxies with strong balmer absorption lines and no emission features , and ( 3 ) galaxies with emission lines , a broad classification which includes blue galaxies as well as red galaxies with absorption - line spectra and weak emission features .",
    "the dominant spectral type in our catalog corresponds to the first of these types : spectra of red galaxies that likely have elliptical and s0 morphologies .",
    "of the 232 cluster members , 177 ( 76% ) have pure absorption - line galaxy spectra dominated by the 4000   break .",
    "these galaxies are labeled `` abs '' in table 1 .",
    "the lower right panel of figure 4 shows a typical absorption - line spectrum ( galaxy number 353 ) .",
    "the spectra of poststarburst galaxies can be modeled as the combination of an old stellar population whose light is dominated by k giant stars and a young population of hot , strong balmer - lined a stars ( dressler & gunn 1983 ; couch & sharples 1987 ) .",
    "we have defined a sample of 11 poststarburst galaxies which have average balmer absorption line strengths , ( h@xmath2+h@xmath3+h@xmath4)/3 , greater than 4.0  and [ oii ] 3727  emission less than 5 .",
    "the balmer line strength measurements are required to be significant at least at the 1 @xmath9 level .",
    "the 11 poststarburst galaxies are labeled `` e@xmath39a '' in table 1 .",
    "histograms of average balmer line strength for all 232 cluster members and for the galaxies without [ oii]3727  emission are plotted in figure 5 .",
    "our cutoff for poststarburst classification is justified in the lower panel of figure 6 , which is a plot of average balmer line strength versus galaxy color .",
    "the poststarburst galaxies can be clearly distinguished from the red absorption - line and bluer emission - line galaxies .",
    "the poststarburst galaxies are blue , although not as blue as the the galaxies with strong emission lines .",
    "some of our poststarburst galaxies display very strong balmer lines ( @xmath8h@xmath2+h@xmath3+h@xmath4@xmath13 @xmath47 8 ) , indicating recent , massive bursts of star formation .",
    "models have indicated that star bursts comprising upwards of 20% of the mass of the galaxy are required to achieve such large balmer line strengths ( dressler & gunn 1983 , poggianti & barbaro 1996 ) .",
    "the lack of detectable emission features in these objects indicates that the star burst was highly efficient in converting gas to stars .",
    "the dominant a type spectrum also implies that the burst occurred approximately 1 gyr before the epoch of observation .",
    "an example of such a flamboyant poststarburst object ( with @xmath8balmers@xmath13=9.1  ) is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the emission - line galaxy population contains those galaxies which , at the epoch of observation , are experiencing star formation at various levels .",
    "the cutoff for inclusion into the emission line category is the presence of [ oii ] 3727  emission with ew @xmath13 5  , with emission line detections at a level of @xmath131 @xmath9 .",
    "the variety of emission - line galaxy behaviors is shown in fig .  4 , and includes late - type galaxies undergoing strong ( [ oii ] 3727  ew @xmath13 50  ) star formation at the epoch of observation ( number 519 ) , galaxies with emission lines _ plus _ strong balmer absorption features ( number 595 ) , and red absorption - line galaxies with weak [ oii ] emission ( number 369 ) . the upper panel of fig .",
    "6 plots the distribution of [ oii ] emission line strength versus galaxy color , demonstrating a clear blueing trend with larger [ oii ] emission strength .",
    "emission strengths above our emission - line galaxy cutoff ( 5  ) yet are shown as absorption - line galaxies ( _ crosses _ ) .",
    "the [ oii ] detections for these objects ( mainly mmt spectra ) are not significant at the 1@xmath9 level . ] a similar correlation between [ oii ] emission and galaxy color is also seen for present - day spirals ( dressler & gunn 1982 ) .",
    "there are 16 emission line galaxies with [ oii ] emission and h@xmath2 absorption stronger than 4 ; these are labeled `` emi@xmath39h@xmath2 '' in table 1 .",
    "the last class of emission - line objects , red galaxies with weak emission ( [ oii ] @xmath8 20  ) , includes galaxies 137 , 143 , 305 , 369 , and the brightest cluster galaxy 375 .",
    "these galaxies have spectra dominated by absorption features yet also display weak emission .",
    "we infer that the star formation histories of these galaxies are , for the most part , similar to those of the rest of the absorption - line population except that they contain enough residual gas to allow a low rate of continued star formation . nonetheless , because of the existence of emission lines in their spectra these objects are classified as `` emi '' in table 1 .",
    "weak emission in nearby red brightest cluster , elliptical , and s0 galaxies is also often observed ( e.g. , fisher , franx , & illingworth 1995 ; 1996 ) .",

    "all five of the galaxies classified by fmb as emission - line meet the emission - line galaxy criteria outlined above .      in order to make possible connections between our cluster galaxy spectra and those from known morphological types and evolutionary sequences",
    "we have compared our cl 1358 + 62 spectra with spectra of present - day ( @xmath0@xmath380 ) galaxies from the collections of kennicutt ( 1992 ) and liu & kennicutt ( 1995 ) .",

    "the points for the cl 1358 + 62 spectra are coded according to the spectral type definitions outlined in  5.1 .",
    "one striking feature of the diagram is the absence of poststarburst galaxies in the kennicutt atlas satisfying our criteria ; all of kennicutt s galaxies with strong h@xmath2 absorption also show [ oii ] emission .",
    "in fact , the kennicutt atlas contains just four galaxies with large h@xmath2 absorption ( @xmath13 5  ) irrespective of [ oii ] emission strength .",
    "in contrast , our collection of cl 1358 + 62 spectra includes a variety of absorption - line , poststarburst , and emission - line galaxies with h@xmath2 absorption ew @xmath13 5 .    excluding the region occupied by the poststarburst galaxies , the absorption - line and emission - line galaxy sequences in cl 1358 + 62 span a locus similar to that of the nearby galaxies .",
    "this is interesting because the kennicutt atlas contains a wide range of normal and peculiar hubble types from the field and cluster environments : early - type elliptical and s0 galaxies , spirals , irregulars , starburst and active galaxies , and hii regions .",
    "this suggests that the galaxy population in cl 1358 + 62 also includes a wide variety of spectral and morphological types , although the mix is different in kennicutts s sample and cl 1358 + 62 .    the lower panel of fig .",
    "7 is similar to the upper panel , except the cluster galaxies are compared with the merging galaxy sample of liu & kennicutt ( _ solid squares _ ) .",

    "the origin of these field poststarburst galaxies is still an open question although galaxy - galaxy interactions have been offered as a possibility ( zabludoff et al .",

    "we have addressed the question of whether the poststarburst galaxy spectra in cl 1358 + 62 resemble those found for major mergers by making a comparison between our `` e+a '' spectra and spectra of nearby merger remnants from kennicutt ( 1992 ) and liu & kennicutt ( 1995 ) .",
    "we find that none of the major merger spectra satisfy our poststarburst selection criteria .",
    "all of the nearby merger remnants have detectable [ oii]3727  emission with equivalent widths larger than 5 .",
    "this implies that the cl 1358 + 62 `` e+a '' galaxies are either not formed by major mergers , or that a process operates that removes the gas from the mergers very quickly after the merger event .",
    "interactions with and/or stripping by the intracluster medium ( gunn & gott 1972 ; bothun & dressler 1986 ) may be an effective mechanism for removing the remaining gas in merging cluster galaxies .",
    "we note that galaxy - galaxy interactions that are less severe than the major mergers of liu & kennicutt have also been offered as a mechanism for truncating star formation in accreting galaxies ( moore et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "if larger samples confirm our tentative observation that poststarburst galaxies are absent in the outermost , lowest density regions of clusters , we might conclude that an infalling galaxy must penetrate to regions where galaxy - galaxy interactions , stripping from the intracluster medium , or interaction with the cluster potential become strong enough to drive their evolution . the h@xmath2-strong galaxies with [ oii ] emission might then represent an intermediate state in a single evolutionary sequence from infalling spiral / irregular to poststarburst galaxy .",

    "( 1997 ) investigated the color - magnitude relation for cl 1358 + 62 using a wide field mosaic of multi - color hst wfpc2 images .",
    "this combination of a magnitude - limited spectroscopic survey and high resolution hst imaging has allowed us to study cl 1358 + 62 , an object with a lookback time @xmath121/3 the present age of the universe , at a level of detail heretofore only attained for a tiny handful of nearby clusters .",
    "our overall goal is to elucidate the key mechanisms governing galaxy evolution by obtaining hst mosaics and ground - based spectra for rich clusters at increasing redshift .",
    "although our program is initially focussed on cluster galaxies , we also serendipitously obtain spectra and images of the foreground and background galaxies along the cluster line - of - sight ( e.g.  franx et al .",
    "we are therefore able to study the stellar populations of field objects with the same level of detail as our cluster galaxies .",
    "the spectral and wfpc2-derived morphological characteristics of these galaxies are currently being examined and results will be presented in forthcoming works .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , caltech , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
