    "local discrimination problems , which are the problems to discriminate unknown quantum state from known candidates by means of local operation and classical communication ( locc ) , has been intensively studied in this 10 years @xcite .",
    "this is because this problem is on the intersection of two significantly important topics of quantum information : _ quantum state discrimination _ @xcite and _ entanglement theory _ @xcite .",
    "quantum state discrimination , which is a protocol to discriminate an unknown states from known candidates , is an essential subroutine for every quantum information processing , since this is the only way to derive classical information from quantum states .",
    "on the other hand , entanglement , which is non - local quantum correlation no - increasing under locc , is considered to be essential for quantum information processing to outperform its classical counterpart . as a result , by studying local discrimination problems , we can understand basic quantum information processing among spatially separated parties , and also the theory of entanglement itself more deeply .",
    "there are various different problem settings of state discrimination problems except the most conventional problem setting @xcite , like quantum hypothesis testing @xcite , quantum state estimation @xcite , and classical capacity of quantum channel @xcite .",
    "thus , there exist various different problem settings on local discrimination problems as well . in this paper ,",
    "we especially treat local discrimination problems in the form of asymptotic hypothesis testing @xcite .    in asymptotic hypothesis testing , by measuring many copies of an unknown state , we aim to certify that the unknown state satisfies a given hypothesis @xmath1 ( called an `` alternative hypothesis '' ) , and in order to do it , we try to reject a hypothesis @xmath2 ( called a `` null hypothesis '' ) which is true when @xmath1 is false .",
    "when a hypothesis ( @xmath2 or @xmath1 ) consists of a single known state , it is called a simple hypothesis . in this paper , we only treat asymptotic hypothesis testing problems whose both null and alternative hypotheses are simple hypotheses .    in asymptotic hypothesis testing ,",
    "there exist two different error probabilities , that is , the error probability judging @xmath1 to be true when @xmath2 is true ( the type 1 error ) and the error probability judging @xmath2 to be true when @xmath1 is true ( the type 2 error ) .",
    "there is a trade - off between these error probability , and hence , the way to treat these error probabilities is not unique .",
    "at least , the following three different optimal error rates are commonly known , and play important roles in many fields of information theory and statistical inference @xcite :    1 .",
    "an asymptotic exponent of the optimal type @xmath3 error under the condition that the type @xmath4 error is upper bounded by a constant .",
    "an asymptotic exponent of the optimal type @xmath3 error under the condition that the exponent of the type @xmath4 error is bounded by a constant .",
    "an optimum exponent of the average of the type @xmath4 and the type @xmath3 error .",
    "the first optimal error exponent is equal to the relative entropy ( or the kullback - leibler divergence ) @xcite between two hypotheses ; this fact is called `` _",
    "stein s lemma _ '' @xcite .",
    "the analytical formulas for the second and the third optimal error exponents are called the _ hoeffding bound _ @xcite and the _ chernoff bound _",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "for all these three optimal error exponents , their formulas are recently extended to the case of the quantum hypothesis testing , where both @xmath2 and @xmath1 are single copies of quantum states ( say @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) : the _ quantum stein s lemma _",
    "@xcite , the _ quantum chernoff bound _",
    "@xcite , and the _ quantum hoeffding bound _ @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is much more difficult to treat an asymptotic quantum hypothesis testing with an additional locality restriction of a povm ( will be called `` _ local asymptotic hypothesis testing _ '' ) , and little is known for it . as far as we know , only two papers treated very special cases of this problem : the paper by matthews et al .",
    "@xcite treats the chernoff bound under various local povms in the case where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are completely symmetric and anti - symmetric werner states , respectively , and the paper by nathanson @xcite treats the chernoff bound under one - way locc povms in the case where @xmath5 is a pure bipartite state with a maximally schmidt coefficient @xmath7 , and @xmath6 satisfies @xmath8 .    in this paper",

    "an analytical formula of the hoeffding bounds is derived under one - way locc povms without any restriction on a parameter , and under separable povms for a restricted region of a parameter .",
    "for other region of the parameter , analytical upper bounds and lower bounds of hoeffding bounds under separable povms are derived .",
    "4 .   the chernoff and the hoeffding bounds under a class of three step ( therefore , two - way ) locc protocols are numerically calculated for low dimensional systems . as as result",
    ", we show that these bounds not only outperform the bounds for one - way locc povms , but almost approximate the bounds for separable povms in the region of parameter where analytical bounds for separable povms are derived .    in the above results ,",
    "the result @xmath3 is remarkable since it gives a new operational meaning for the logarithmic robustness of entanglement in term of this local asymptotic hypothesis testing problem ; for another operational meaning of logarithmic robustness , see @xcite .",
    "the result @xmath17 is also remarkable since , as far as we know , this is first time to find a gap between optimal error exponents under one - way locc and under two - way locc in asymptotic local discrimination problems ; that is , so far , all such gaps are find in optimal error probabilities in non - asymptotic local discrimination problems @xcite , and it was not known whether such gaps survive in their asymptotic extensions .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec preliminary ] , we give mathematical descriptions of our hypothesis testing problem and known results about optimal error exponents under global povm .",

    "we choose the completely mixed state @xmath38 as a null hypothesis and the state @xmath39 as an alternative hypothesis . in the following part of this section , we give definitions of various error exponents and optimal error exponents for a general simple null hypothesis @xmath40 and an alternative hypothesis @xmath41 .",
    "thus , @xmath42 and @xmath43 in our local hypothesis testing problem .",

    "we define the hoeffding bound of the corresponding global hypothesis testing as : @xmath276 then , theorem [ theorem previous paper 1 ] is immediately rewritten as :    [ lemma b_sep r = b^r r - log d ] for @xmath277 , @xmath278    on the other hand , we can evaluate @xmath279 as follows :    [ lemma b^r r ] @xmath280    * ( proof ) * + first , by choosing @xmath281 , we observe @xmath282 and @xmath283 .",
    "these equations guarantee eq.([eq b^r r = infty ] ) .",
    "second , we will show eq.([eq b^r r le -log braket ] ) .",
    "suppose @xmath284 is defined as @xmath285 , and @xmath286 is defined as @xmath287 then , the inequality @xmath288 guarantees @xmath289 on the other hand , by the definition , we observe @xmath290 .",
    "this fact and eq.([eq global hoeffding ] ) guarantee @xmath291 this equation together with eq.([eq b^r le b^r_0 ] ) guarantees eq.([eq b^r r le -log braket ] ) .",
    "@xmath127    the stein - type s strong converse bound @xmath292 also gives information about the value of @xmath293 as follows :    [ lemma strong converse to hoeffding sep ] for @xmath294 , @xmath295 .",
    "* ( proof ) * + suppose a sequence of separable povms @xmath296 satisfies @xmath297 . then , from the definition of @xmath298 , @xmath299 .",
    "this fact guarantees the statement of the lemma .",
    "@xmath127    finally , we evaluate @xmath293 as follows :    [ theorem capital b_sep r ] @xmath300    * ( proof ) * + lemma [ lemma b_sep r = b^r r - log d ] , [ lemma b^r r ] , [ lemma strong converse to hoeffding sep ] and corollary [ corollary strong converse ] guarantee this theorem .",
    "@xmath127    from this theorem , we can also evaluate @xmath301 :    [ corollary a sep r ] for @xmath302 , @xmath301 is given as @xmath303 and for @xmath304 , it is evaluated as @xmath305    * ( proof ) * + first , the second inequality of eq.([eq log d max - log braket le a sep r le ] ) comes from the inequality @xmath306 .",
    "second , eq.([b_sep r = + infty ] ) guarantees @xmath307 this guarantees the first inequality of eq.([eq log d max - log braket le a sep r le ] ) .",
    "finally , eq.([eq b sep r le -log braket ] ) guarantees that there is no sequence of separable povms @xmath308 satisfying @xmath309 and @xmath310 .",
    "this fact and the inequality ( [ eq a sep r ge log d max -log braket ] ) guarantee the equality ( [ eq a sep r = log d max - log braket ] ) . @xmath127    here",
    ", we note that when @xmath0 is a maximally entangled state , we have @xmath311 and @xmath312 .",
    "hence , theorem [ theorem capital b_sep r ] and corollary [ corollary a sep r ] completely determine the behavior of @xmath293 and @xmath301 in this case , respectively .",
    "in this section , we consider the case of @xmath313 , that is , the local hypothesis testing under separable locc povms .    in the previous paper @xcite",
    ", we showed that there is a gap between optimal error probabilities under one - way and two - way locc povms in non - asymptotic problem settings of this local hypothesis testing . on the other hand , in asymptotic problem settings ,",
    "we have already proved that there is no difference among one - way , two - way locc , and separable povms in terms of the stein s lemma type of the optimal error exponents @xmath314 and @xmath315 in theorem [ theorem sec asymptotic ] .",
    "hence , in this section , we concentrate ourselves on the chernoff and hoeffding bounds under two - way locc povms , and ask a question whether there is a gap between one - way and two - way locc povms .",
    "since the definition of the two - way locc is mathematically complicated in comparison to that of one - way locc and separable operations , it seems impossible to derive analytical formula for the chernoff and hoeffding bounds under two - way locc povm .",
    "hence , we try to derive a lower bound of the chernoff and hoeffding bounds under two - way locc povm by numerical calculations .    since infinite number of parameters are necessary to describe general two - way locc operations , it is impossible to optimize the error exponent numerically for general two - way locc protocols .",
    "thus , here , we consider only a special class of tree step locc protocols which can outperform any one - way locc protocols in non - asymptotic problem settings @xcite .",
    "however , even if we restrict ourselves on the special class of three step locc protocols , we need to treat infinitely many parameters in an asymptotic situation . thus , in order to simplify the analysis furthermore , we only consider the situation where alice and bob apply the three step locc protocols for each single copy of an unknown state , and then , they apply an optimal classical hypothesis testing protocol on the resulted unknown classical probability distribution .    for one copy of the unknown state ( @xmath0 or @xmath316 ) ,",
    "the tree - step locc protocol is described as follows :    1 .",
    "alice measures her state by a povm @xmath317 . here , @xmath318 is a power set ( a set of all subsets ) of a finite set @xmath319 including an empty set @xmath320 . for a non empty set @xmath321 ,",
    "@xmath322 is defined as @xmath323 in terms of positive coefficients @xmath324 , where @xmath325 is alice s part of the schmidt basis of @xmath0 .",
    "then , @xmath326 is defined as @xmath327 . when alice s result is @xmath320 , alice and bob stop the protocol and conclude the unknown state to be @xmath316",
    "otherwise , they continue the protocol .",
    "2 .   at the second step",
    ", bob measures his state by a povm @xmath328 depending on alice s measurement result @xmath321 , where @xmath329 is a size of set @xmath321 . for @xmath330 ,",
    "@xmath331 is defined as @xmath332 , where @xmath333 is a mutually unbiased basis of the subspace @xmath334 .",

    "when bob derive the result @xmath109 , alice and bob stop the protocol and conclude the unknown state to be @xmath316 .",
    "otherwise , they continue the protocol .",
    "3 .   at the third step ,",
    "alice measures her states by a povm @xmath337 , where @xmath338 .",
    "here , @xmath339 is chosen as alice s state after the bob s measurement in the case when the given state is @xmath0 , and is defined as @xmath340 , where @xmath341 , and @xmath342 is the transposition in the schmidt basis of @xmath0 .",
    "when alice s measurement result @xmath208 is @xmath109 , alice and bob conclude the unknown state to be @xmath0 , and otherwise they conclude the unknown state to be @xmath316 .    here",
    ", we note that the diagonal elements of the first alice s povm @xmath343 are the only free parameters on this three step locc protocol .    after applying the above protocol for each single copy of @xmath18-copies of an unknown state , alice and bob derive @xmath18-copies of unknown classical probability distributions .",
    "we call the unknown distribution @xmath344 or @xmath345 depending on the initial state @xmath0 or @xmath316 , where @xmath321 , @xmath346 , @xmath208 are the results of alice s first , bob s , and alice s second povms , respectively .",
    "thus , by applying an asymptotically - optimal classical hypothesis testing , the chernoff and hoeffding types of error rates achieve the classical chernoff and hoeffding bounds between @xmath347 and @xmath345 , respectively . by optimizing them over @xmath343",
    ", we derive the best error exponents which can be achieved by the above three step locc protocols .",
    "we write such bounds as @xmath348 and @xmath349 , where @xmath348 is the chernoff type , and @xmath349 is the hoeffding type .",
    "hence , those are defined as : @xmath350 in the above formula , @xmath351 is defined by the relation @xmath352 for @xmath353 . @xmath354 and @xmath355 are the classical chernoff @xcite and hoeffding bounds @xcite . by their definitions ,",
    "these error exponents are upper and lower bounded by the optimal error exponents of one - way and two - way locc povm , respectively :    @xmath356    * ( proof ) * + the proofs of eq.([eq two way tilde xi ] ) and eq.([eq two way tilde a ] ) are essentially the same .",
    "their second inequalities comes directly from their definitions , since @xmath348 and @xmath357 are optimal chernoff and hoeffding error exponents for the particular class of two - way locc povms . on the other hand , lemma",
    "[ sec one - way lemma ] guarantees that an optimal one - way locc protocol is just the projection onto the schmidt basis of @xmath0 followed by classical information processing .",
    "actually , the projection onto the schmidt basis is included in the above three step locc protocols when @xmath358 for @xmath359 , and @xmath360 for the other choices of @xmath321 .",

    "we chose @xmath0 as @xmath373 in fig.1 , and @xmath374 in fig.2 . here",
    ", we observe that @xmath348 is always strictly larger than @xmath367 except the case when @xmath0 is a product state or a maximally entangled state , and , moreover , it well approximates @xmath211 .",

    "before show the plots , we gives two remarks .",
    "first , from the definition , the hoeffding bound is equal to the stein s lemma type of the error exponent in the limit of @xmath376 .",
    "thus , the y - intercepts of the plots for one - way locc @xmath377 , two - way locc @xmath378 , and separable povm @xmath301 are all equal to @xmath379 , although , as we can observe from fig . 3 and 4 , the convergence of @xmath371 in the limit @xmath380 is very slow .",
    "second , when a given @xmath381 satisfies @xmath382 , the hoeffding bound for @xmath381 is equal to the chernoff bound : @xmath383 .",
    "we can actually find such a @xmath381 as an intersection of the graphs of @xmath384 and @xmath385 .",
    "thus , we can derive the value of @xmath386 from the plots of @xmath375 .",
    "for one - way locc povms , we have an analytical expression of @xmath371 via theorem [ theorem one way ] . on the other hand ,",
    "for separable povms , since we do not know an analytical formula for @xmath301 available for all range of @xmath387 , we use analytical upper @xmath369 and lower bounds @xmath370 of @xmath301 derived from corollary [ corollary a sep r ] instead of @xmath301 : @xmath388 fig.3 and fig.4 are plots of the hoeffding bounds @xmath368 , @xmath369,@xmath370 , @xmath357 , @xmath371 as functions of the parameter @xmath103 , respectively . here , @xmath357 is numerically calculated by means of eq.([eq tilde a = sup s ] ) and eq.([eq two way f s omega = -log ] ) .",
    "we chose @xmath0 as @xmath389 in fig.3 , and @xmath390 in fig.4 .    from fig . 3 and fig .",
