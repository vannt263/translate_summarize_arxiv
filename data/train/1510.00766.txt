    "the lines of the ca ii triplet at @xmath38498 , 8542 , and 8662 are the strongest lines in the far - red spectral region in late - type red giant stars . as a result",
    ", measurements of the strength of these lines have been extensively used as a metallicity indicator in a variety of stellar systems .",
    "these include galactic globular clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and dwarf irregular galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the calibration of the measured ca ii line strengths is usually carried out by observing with the same instrument stars in systems whose abundances are known from another source . usually , but not always , the calibration is carried out in terms of [ fe / h ] , which is adopted as a proxy for overall abundance",
    "the alternative is to calibrate to [ ca / h ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) although naturally this requires knowledge of the [ ca / h ] values for the calibration objects . the original studies concentrated primarily on metallicity determinations for relatively old and metal - poor systems .",
    "subsequent work , however , has demonstrated that the influence of age on the technique is relatively small @xcite , so that it can be applied to stellar systems with ages as young as @xmath20.3 gyr .",
    "the form of the metallicity calibration has also been investigated at both the metal - rich and metal - poor regimes . at higher metallicities ,",
    "i.e. , near solar and above , the form of the line strength calibration relation remains relatively linear ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but as shown by @xcite and @xcite , at metallicities below [ fe / h ] @xmath4 2.5 the relation between ca ii triplet line strength and abundance becomes notably non - linear .    a question that remains relatively little explored , however ,",
    "is the role of [ ca / fe ]  if the objects under study have very different [ ca / fe ] ratios from those in the calibrating objects , are the derived [ fe / h ] values significantly biased ?",
    "the answer to this question is important because , for example , low mass dwarf galaxies have a different chemical enrichment history to the halo and disk of the galaxy , generally showing substantially lower [ alpha / fe ] ratios compared to galactic stars of similar [ fe / h ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite investigated this question ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and found the effect of different [ ca / fe ] abundance ratios is relatively minor , but further studies of the issue are required . that then is the purpose of this paper  to investigate the influence of [ ca / fe ] on [ fe / h ] determinations from the ca ii method .",
    "this is achieved by developing a standard ca ii line strength calibration using a number of galactic calibrators , and then applying the calibration to ca ii line strength measurements for red giants in the disk of the lmc .",
    "the lmc stars have been observed at high resolution so that both [ fe / h ] and [ ca / fe ] values are available , allowing a direct comparison between the two abundance measures and an investigation of whether any differences are related to the [ ca / fe ] values .",
    "the observations and data reduction techniques are discussed in the following section , along with an evaluation of the membership status of the cluster stars observed . in ",
    "3 the line strength analysis method adopted is presented , while in  4 the abundance calibration relation is derived .",
    "the results are then presented and discussed in the final section .",
    "the data for this study consist of observations of galactic globular and open clusters , which are used to provide a calibration between ca ii triplet line strength and abundance [ fe / h ] , and observations of a sample of red giants in the disk of the lmc orginally studied at high dispersion by @xcite , and for which an updated analysis is available in @xcite .",
    "all observations were carried out at the anglo - australian telescope using the 2df multi - object fibre positioner and the aaomega dual beam spectrograph @xcite .",
    "the red arm of the spectrograph was configured with the 1700d grating centred at @xmath38600 to give coverage of the ca ii triplet lines with a resolution _",
    "r _ of approximately 10000 .",
    "the corresponding blue spectra are not used in this work .",
    "five galactic globular clusters ( ngc  104 ( 47  tuc ) , 288 , 1904 , 2298 and 7099 ( m30 ) ) and two galactic open clusters ( melotte 66 and m67 ) were observed over a number of different nights as parts of other programs , usually when conditions were not optimal for the main program .",
    "the lmc disk field was observed as part of a larger program concentrating on the lmc .",
    "details of the observations of the galactic calibrators and the lmc disk field are given table [ tab1 ] .",
    "for the globular clusters the input catalogues to the fibre allocation software were drawn initially from the position and photometry information available in the photometric standard star fields database maintained by stetson .",
    "stars brighter than the horizontal branch on both the red giant ( rgb ) and asymptotic giant branches ( agb ) were selected with final positions sourced from the ucac4 catalogue @xcite . for melotte  66 candidate red giants at the magnitude of the red clump and brighter",
    "were selected from the photometry of @xcite with positions again sourced from the ucac4 catalogue .",
    "the stetson photometry and position information were also used as the initial source for the open cluster m67 . here",
    ", given the sparseness of the giant branch , the input catalogue included 3 red clump stars as well as 2 additional bright red giant members that lack stetson photometry .",
    "positions were again taken from the ucac4 catalogue .",
    ".observations [ cols=\"<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath5 the full table is available in the associated on - line material .",
    "this version outlines the format of the data file .    because of the lack of dependence on metallicity of the slope of the relations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the information for each cluster can be reduced to a single parameter , the reduced equivalent width @xmath6 , which is defined as the value of @xmath7w at @xmath8 = 0 .",
    "we now explore the relation between @xmath6 and [ fe / h ] for these galactic calibration objects , noting that the uncertainties in the @xmath6 values are small : they range between 0.02 and 0.05  .",
    "in the upper panel of fig .  [ fig3 ] the value of @xmath6 for each galactic calibration object is plotted against the adopted [ fe / h ] value . for the globular clusters the [ fe / h ] values",
    "are taken from appendix i of @xcite where the tabulated abundances can be traced back to a consistent set of high dispersion analyses of red giants in a number of clusters @xcite . for the open clusters",
    "melotte 66 and m67 the results of high dispersion studies have also been adopted : that of @xcite who find [ fe / h ] = @xmath9 0.03 for melotte 66 , and that of @xcite who find [ fe / h ] = + 0.02 @xmath9 0.08 for m67 .",
    "a linear least squares fit to the ( @xmath6 , [ fe / h ] ) data points is also shown in the figure .",
    "this fit is given by the equation : @xmath10 = 0.528 \\pm0.017 w^{\\prime } - 3.420 \\pm 0.077\\ ] ] with the _ rms _ about the fit being 0.06 dex .",
    "there is no convincing indication of any deviation from linearity within the range for which the equation is valid : 2.4 @xmath11 [ fe / h ] @xmath11 + 0.1 dex , although as noted by @xcite and @xcite a linear relation ceases to be appropriate in the extremely metal - poor regime .",
    "it is of interest to compare this calibration with other recent determinations .",
    "for example , @xcite used essentially identical measurement and analysis techniques as those employed here to determine @xmath6 values for a number of galactic globular clusters from samples of red giants observed with the fors2 multi - object spectrograph .",
    "although there are no clusters in common , the similarity in approach suggests that the @xmath6 values for the calibration clusters in @xcite should be directly analogous to those measured here .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows these @xmath6 values again plotted against [ fe / h ] values from @xcite .",
    "@xcite adopted a cubic calibration relation and that is also shown on the figure . in general there is quite reasonable agreement between this work and that of @xcite for the clusters less metal - rich than [ fe / h ] @xmath4 0.8 dex ( i.e. , 47  tuc and m71 ) but the more metal - rich clusters in @xcite , particularly ngc  5927 and ngc  6528 , have notably smaller @xmath6 values than would be expected for their abundances and the linear calibration given in equation [ eq1 ] , necessitating the cubic calibration relation .",
    "it is not at all clear why these metal - rich clusters differ from the location of old open clusters with similar metallicities , although small sample sizes ( e.g. , 4 stars in ngc  5927 and 7 in ngc  6528 ) combined with significant differential reddening may play a role ( see also the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "other calibrations such as those of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , for example , that have employed old open clusters for the metal - rich part of the calibration , generally find linear relations analogous to equation [ eq1 ] .",
    "we further note that if we use the clusters melotte  66 , 47  tuc , ngc  288 , 1904 , 2298 , 4590 and 7078 to establish a linear relationship between @xmath6 as measured here or in @xcite , and @xmath6 as given by @xcite , then the relationship is well defined with an _ rms _ dispersion of only 0.09  . if we then use that relationship to convert the @xmath6 values for ngc  5927 and ngc  6528 given by @xcite to the @xmath6 scale used here , then the resulting values of 5.94 and 6.33  , respectively , are much closer to the calibration defined by equation [ eq1 ] . as further support",
    "we note that the recent calibration presented by @xcite , which is shown as the dot - dash line in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , is also consistent with that adopted here .",
    "in fig .  [ fig4 ]",
    "we illustrate the issue under investigation by plotting [ ca / fe ] abundance ratios against [ fe / h]@xmath1 determinations based on high dispersion analyses . ] for the galactic calibration objects and for the 32 lmc disk red giants observed here that pass the radial velocity and s / n checks . for the globular clusters the [ ca / fe ] values are taken from the high resolution study of @xcite for ngc  7099 , 1904 , 288 and 47  tuc , while that for ngc  2298 comes from @xcite , which is also based on high dispersion spectroscopic data .",
    "the [ ca / fe ] values for melotte 66 and m67 come from the high dispersion analyses of @xcite and @xcite , respectively . the abundances , abundance ratios , and their uncertainties for the lmc disk red giants are taken directly from @xcite . the lmc sample used here",
    "has a median [ fe / h]@xmath1 of 0.69 and a median [ ca / fe ] of 0.04 dex . at this [ fe / h]@xmath1 value",
    "the galactic calibration objects typically have [ ca / fe ] ratios that are approximately 0.3 dex higher .    in order to derive [ fe / h ] values for the lmc stars using the calibration developed here , i.e. , via equation [ eq1 ] , we proceed as follows .",
    "the @xmath12 magnitudes of the lmc disk giants observed by @xcite are available on - line , while @xcite list the mean magnitude of the red clump in this lmc disk field as @xmath12 = 19.26 .",
    "adopting this value as @xmath13 then allows us to correct the measured @xmath7w for each lmc star to the equivalent @xmath6 value , which can then be used with equation [ eq1 ] to derive abundance values .",
    "these are denoted by [ fe / h]@xmath0 .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the outcome of this process ",
    "the upper panel plots [ fe / h]@xmath0 against [ fe / h]@xmath1 while the lower panel shows the difference ( [ fe / h]@xmath0  [ fe / h]@xmath1 ) against [ fe / h]@xmath1 for the 32 lmc disk red giants .",
    "the two [ fe / h ] determinations are clearly well - correlated but equally clearly a systematic offset is present . after removing two stars that are more than 2@xmath14 discrepant ,",
    "the mean difference for the remaining 30 stars is 0.14 dex , in the sense that the [ fe / h]@xmath0 is more metal - rich , with a standard deviation of 0.21 dex .",
    "the standard deviation is consistent with that expected from the errors : @xmath14[fe / h]@xmath1 = 0.11 dex @xcite combined with a typical error in @xmath7w for the lmc stars of @xmath20.3  and the calibration uncertainty of 0.06 dex .",
    "further , as is apparent in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , aside from the offset between the two measures there is no evidence for any systematic dependence of the difference on [ fe / h]@xmath1 , indicating that the abundance scales are consistent .",
    "this is not unexpected since both scales ultimately depend on high dispersion spectroscopic analyses but is reassuring nevertheless .",
    "the result here contrasts with that in @xcite where , above [ fe / h]@xmath1 @xmath4 0.5 , there is an increasing difference between the [ fe / h]@xmath1 values and the [ fe / h]@xmath0 values from @xcite .",
    "the sense is that the [ fe / h]@xmath0 values become more metal - rich .    as for the systematic offset between the abundance values found here",
    ", it most likely has a straightforward explanation , one already anticipated to some extent by , for example , @xcite and @xcite . using the reddening for the lmc disk field given by @xcite , e@xmath15 = 0.12 mag , and an lmc distance modulus ( m - m)@xmath16 of 18.50 @xcite , the adopted lmc @xmath13 value of 19.26 corresponds to @xmath17 = 0.38  a value that is @xmath20.4 mag brighter than the red clump stars in melotte 66 or m67 , for example , which have @xmath17 @xmath4 0.8 .",
    "if a value of @xmath13 value of 19.66 had been used instead for the lmc stars , then the resulting metallicities would have been _ lower _ by 0.4 @xmath18 0.66 @xmath18 0.528 = 0.14 dex , precisely the offset seen .",
    "this reinforces the result that the abundance scale used in the calibration of the ca  ii line strengths is in excellent agreement with direct [ fe / h ] determinations via high dispersion spectroscopy .",
    "it also suggests that the approach advocated by @xcite , where @xmath17 or @xmath19 is used in place of @xmath13 , may be prefereable in situations where there is a large age range , or a dominant younger population , present , as is the case here .",
    "in particular , as noted by @xcite , in systems like the disk of the lmc where there has been extensive on - going star formation , the magnitude of the old core - helium burning stars , i.e. , @xmath13 , is often not well defined as the red clump region of the cmd is dominated by more luminous younger stars . in such situations ,",
    "however , the distance modulus is often well established , e.g. , via cepheids , and thus the absolute magnitude @xmath17 is known more precisely than @xmath8 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "turning now to the role of [ ca / fe ] , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the relation between the difference [ fe / h]@xmath0  [ fe / h]@xmath1 and [ ca / fe ] for the 32 lmc disk red giants .",
    "if the [ ca / fe ] abundance ratio plays a significant role in influencing the overall abundance estimated from the ca  ii line strengths , then a positive correlation is expected in this diagram  the abundance from the ca  ii triplet line strength and the galactic calibration should underestimate [ fe / h]@xmath1 when the [ ca / fe ] value is low compared to the calibrators . while the standard deviation of the abundance differences is sizeable , the data in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] demonstrate little compelling evidence for any significant dependence of the abundance difference on the [ ca / fe ] abundance ratio .",
    "in particular , if the data are separated into two sub - samples , one containing the 17 stars with [ ca / fe ] less than the overall mean , and one with the 13 stars where the [ ca / fe ] exceeds the overall mean , then the mean abundance differences for these two sub - samples do not differ .",
    "while better signal - to - noise spectra at the ca  ii triplet for this sample of stars may have allowed tighter constraints , the data of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] indicate that the effect on [ fe / h]@xmath0 of [ ca / fe ] is relatively limited  at most a @xmath20.2 dex underestimate when [ ca / fe ] is substantially below the solar value .    in many respects",
    "the results presented here are a confirmation of those presented in @xcite who also found little indication of any substantial dependence of [ fe / h]@xmath0 on [ ca / fe ] . in their work",
    "@xcite obtained moderate resolution spectra at the ca  ii triplet , as well as high dispersion spectroscopy , for a large sample of red giants in the sculptor and fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "the high dispersion results were used to directly calibrate the ca  ii triplet line strengths in terms of [ fe / h]@xmath1 .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows their data presented in the same way as for fig .",
    "not surprisingly given the calibration process used , there is a negligible offset between [ fe / h]@xmath0 and [ fe / h]@xmath1 : formally for the 125 stars in the combined sculptor and fornax samples , the mean difference [ fe / h]@xmath0  [ fe / h]@xmath1 is with a standard deviation of 0.11 dex .",
    "again there is little evidence for any substantial dependence on [ ca / fe ]  as for fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the change in [ fe / h]@xmath0  [ fe / h]@xmath1 over the full range of [ ca / fe ] observed is relatively small , of order 0.2 dex .",
    "a least squares fit to the data points in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] yields the following equation : @xmath20_{cat } - [ fe / h]_{spec } ) = 0.293\\pm0.065 [ ca / fe ] - 0.038\\pm0.014\\ ] ] the correlation coefficient from the least squares fit is 0.377 indicating that the null hypothesis , namely that the data points are uncorrelated , can be ruled out with a high degree of significance . in other words , there is a genuine dependence of the abundance difference on [ ca / fe ] .",
    "as regards the slope of the relation , applying a bootstrap resampling process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with 1000 trials to the 125 ( @xmath21[fe / h ] , [ ca / fe ] ) pairs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , yields a mean slope of 0.276 dex / dex , entirely consistent with that in equation [ eq3 ] .",
    "the relation from equation [ eq3 ] is also shown in fig",
    ".  [ fig7 ] , after allowing for the 0.14 dex abundance offset , and is clearly compatible with the lmc results derived here .",
    "indeed a slope of @xmath20.3 lies within the inter - quartile range of those derived from the data in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] in a similar bootstrap resampling analysis .",
    "in summary , a change [ ca / fe ] from a typical galactic value of + 0.3 to a value of 0.2 typical of those seen in the lmc and dwarf spheroidal galaxies will result , assuming the use of galactic calibrators , in an underestimate of the true [ fe / h ] value by @xmath20.15 dex when using the ca  ii triplet method to estimate the overall abundance .",
    "since effects of this size are frequently less than the random error in the abundance determinations via the ca  ii triplet method for red giants in relatively distant dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the chemical evolution history is generally unknown , the results here reaffirm that the ca  ii triplet approach can be used in the knowledge that the outcomes are not significantly affected by ignorance of the actual [ ca / fe ] abundance ratios .",
