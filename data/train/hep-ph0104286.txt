    "it is widely believed that not all the parameters occurring in the standard model are independent and there must be some interrelation between them .",
    "the most striking feature of the standard model in this regard is the fact that top quark mass is nearly same as the electroweak symmetry breaking parameter ( ewsb ) , @xmath8 gev ( @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the fermi constant ) .",
    "this has lead several authors to propose mechanisms similar to the bcs superconductors for ewsb  @xcite .",
    "it was already noted way back in 1961 by nambu and jona - lasinio  @xcite , that in these models , besides the zero mass collective excitations , [ which become the longitudinal component of the gauge bosons ] there is also a scalar bound state of the massive quasi - fermions with a mass appproximately twice that of the fermion mass .",
    "this theoretical prediction was confirmed experimentally in bcs superconductors in raman spectra studies .",
    "this generic relation between the fermion mass and the associated scalar particles is present in he - iii and in spectra of several nuclei where pairing place an important role .",
    "it is conceivable , that bcs type symmetry breaking is truly ubiquitous and extends also to electroweak symmetry breaking . for our purposes",
    "it is sufficient to note that such theories the scalar self - coupling is proportional to the square of the quasi - fermion scalar coupling .",
    "bounds on the top - quark mass as well as the higgs mass were obtained many years ago by cabibbo et .",
    "@xcite by requiring that the coupling constants remain positive and the vacuum state be stable .",
    "this in turn has given rise to a large activity which uses phenomenological ideas like infrared fixed points , quasi - fixed points and supersymmetric extension of these .",
    "for a review of these topics , see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "on the other hand several years ago zimmermann introduced the idea of reduction of coupling constants in a renormalizable field theory  @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that a theory written in terms of several coupling constants @xmath11 contains really only one independent constant @xmath12 with others expressible as functions of @xmath13 @xmath14 zimmermann , then showed that the beta functions must satisfy relations of the type : @xmath15 where @xmath16 denoted the @xmath17-function corresponding to @xmath18 .    assuming a power series expansion",
    ", one may try to solve these equations and then discover relations between couplings leading to a reduction in the number of independent ones . in the context of the standard model",
    "this programme has been considered in detail in ref .",
    "a major difficulty in this programme is the following .",
    "if one considers for example the reduction of the u(1 ) gauge coupling @xmath19 in terms of the su(3 ) colour coupling @xmath0 in the lowest order , it has no solution , which can be traced to the fact that while non - abelian gauge couplings have negative beta funnction ( asymptotically free ) , in contrast to u(1 ) which has positive beta function with a coupling that grows with energy .",
    "the renormalization group equations being first order differential equations require for their solution the specification of the couplings at some arbitrary scale . in the one - loop approximation ,",
    "the equations for @xmath20 and @xmath0 the gauge couplings , and @xmath1 , the yukawa coupling of the higgs to the top quark , can be solved easily using the experimental values of the gauge couplings say at the z - mass and the top quark mass .",
    "the details are provided in sec .",
    "ii . in this introduction",
    "we simply note from fig . 1 where the solution of the coupling constants @xmath21 and @xmath22 for an energy scale running from 10 gev to a tev is displayed , that @xmath22 like @xmath21 also falls with increasing energy and the ratio of @xmath23 roughly remains the same over this range .",
    "this is discussed in more detail later .",
    "it was mentioned above that bcs type theories that the higgs self - coupling @xmath2 is proportional @xmath3 . to carry this analogy over to a relativistic field theory",
    ", we need to specify the energy scale where we expect these relations to hold .    guided by the observation of the near scale independence of the ratio of the @xmath24 made above",
    ", we now make a simple hypothesis .",
    "the ratio @xmath4 is independent of the renormailzation scale @xmath5 .",
    "this fixes the integration constant of renormalization group equation for @xmath2 and therefore the higgs mass .    in an earlier work ,",
    "one of us had used this criterion of scale independence of the coupling constant ratios to one - loop to determine the higgs mass  @xcite . here",
    "we extend these considerations to two - loop renormalization group equations . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the difference between the pole mass and the renormalization group mass was ignored . here",
    "we repair the deficiency .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we specify our normalisations , the pole mass and renormalization group mass relations and the solution of renormalization group equations in the one - loop and two - loop cases . in sec .",
    "iii , we compare our results with indirect estimates of the higgs mass from electroweak precision data and also some of the other theoretical ideas on the subject . an appendix explains the relation of our assumption of scale independence to the coupling constant reduction method .",
    "in a renormalizable field theory , one first specifies the values of the various couplings and masses at some arbitrary momentum scale @xmath25 .",
    "the physical matrix elements are obtained from the green functions .",
    "the requirement that the physical quantities are independent of @xmath25 leads to the renormalization group equations .",
    "the renormalization group equations up to two - loops in perturbation theory have been calculated in the @xmath26 renormalization scheme for the couplings of the standard model and its minimal supersymmetric extension , for a review , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite . in the following",
    "we shall consider the solution of the renormalization group equations for the standard model setting all couplings other than @xmath27 and @xmath2 , to zero .",
    "the renormalization group equations valid for @xmath28 read ( @xmath29 ) : @xmath30    here we solve these coupled differential equations both for the one - loop as well as the two - loop case . we have proceeded as follows : we first take the values of the gauge couplings @xmath19 , @xmath31 and @xmath0 at the z - peak and evolve them via the renormalization group equations to the scale @xmath32 , with 5 flavors of quarks . for scales larger than @xmath32",
    "we employ the equations with 6 quark flavors .",
    "the values we take at the z - peak are @xmath33 .",
    "we take the pole mass for the top - quark to be @xmath34 gev .",
    "the relation between between the pole mass @xmath35 and the renormalization group mass @xmath36 at the scale @xmath25 is @xmath37 with @xmath38 , @xmath39 gev .",
    "the correction term @xmath40 is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . when computed numerically we find it to be small and for the case at hand , @xmath41 , which in turn corresponds to a value of @xmath42 .    with these inputs",
    "it is now easy to obtain solutions for @xmath43 and @xmath1 .",
    "it was mentioned in the introduction that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 decrease asymptotically and their ratio remains a constant .",
    "this is displayed in fig .",
    "1 , where the functional dependence of @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the interval corresponding to @xmath44 gev to 1 tev is displayed .",
    "it is sufficient to note here that in this interval while both @xmath0 and @xmath1 drop by a factor of nearly 2 , their ratio approximately remains constant .",
    "later on we also study the behaviour of this ratio for higher energy intervals in the one - loop and two - loop cases",
    ". it will be seen that the constancy improves at the two - loop level as compared to the one - loop level .    now , to determine @xmath2 we proceed as follows .",
    "consider an arbitrary value at the scale @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "given this the corresponding value of @xmath47 is fixed from the renormalization group equation for @xmath47 , in the entire domain of @xmath5 where the equations are valid .",
    "we solve these equations numerically and consider the ratio @xmath48 conveniently normalized to unity at @xmath49 : @xmath50 .",
    "the results of the computations are plotted for values of @xmath25 between @xmath32 and a large scale , say @xmath51 gev , which then corresponds to @xmath52 in fig .",
    "we find that the value of @xmath53 corresponding to the middle line is the one that best satisfies our criterion of constancy of @xmath54 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath54 when @xmath46 is varied from slightly from @xmath55 is also shown in fig .",
    "2 . clearly",
    "even such small departures of @xmath46 from @xmath55 lead to significant @xmath5 dependence and the corresponding ratio of couplings fail to meet our criterion of scale independence .",
    "larger variations would lead to even larger departure from the desired constancy .",
    "it should be stressed here that the best value for @xmath46 determined by the scale independence criterion does not depend significantly on the range of @xmath5 .",
    "starting from this best value @xmath53 , the corresponding @xmath47 is used to determine the higgs mass as follows .",
    "first the renormalization group mass is found from the equation @xmath56 the pole mass is related to the renormalization group equation mass above by @xmath57 details of @xmath58 are given in the review , ref .",
    "numerically again it is small and we find it to be @xmath59 , for @xmath60 . using this , we find that at one - loop @xmath61 comparing this value of 154 gev to the value given in ref .",
    "@xcite of 160 gev , the small difference arises due to the following improvements .",
    "here we have taken into account the pole mass of the top - quark to be 174 gev unlike the earlier work where it was the renormalization group mass . in the earlier work",
    "the @xmath49 corresponded to @xmath62 and the fact that only five flavours are operative below @xmath32 was ignored .",
    "furthermore , the value for the higgs mass quoted here corresponds to its pole mass , which differs by about 5% from its renormalization group mass .    in fig .",
    "3 , the analogous computation is performed with the two - loop beta functions . the best value of @xmath46 changes slightly to @xmath63 . repeating the calculations described above for the pole mass",
    ", we find at two - loop @xmath64    we now return to the ratio of @xmath65 which we observed in the introduction to be nearly constant .",
    "we plot this ratio , again normalized to its value at @xmath49 for the range of values for @xmath25 from @xmath32 to @xmath51 gev , in fig .",
    "it is seen that at one - loop level that this is nearly constant , with the ratio tending to increase slightly for increasing energies . in fig .",
    "5 we show the results for the same ratio at the two - loop level . it is observed that the ratio is unity to within as little as 5% even at energies as high as @xmath51 gev . note that this feature is virtually independent of the higgs mass when varied around our preferred value of 148 gev by a few percent on either side and the figures corresponding to these variations in the higgs mass lie on top of each other ( see caption of fig .",
    "this leads to the question whether one can `` determine '' the top mass by the requirement of scale independence of the ratio @xmath23 . in order to address this , instead of considering a variety of values for the top - quark pole mass and the corresponding changes in @xmath66",
    ", we can simply illustrate this equivalently by varying the values of @xmath1 at @xmath67 gev .",
    "we have chosen the values 0.85 , 0.95 and 1.05 .",
    "it is seen from fig . 6",
    "that at one - loop level the scale independence criterion would put the top - quark mass at a slightly lower value than the experimental one . on the other hand , from fig .",
    "7 we see that at the two - loop level this criterion leads to a value for the top - quark mass quite close to the experimental value , when @xmath68 is in the neighbourhood of 148 gev .",
    "it is thus seen that our criterion of scale independence of the ratios of couplings has an internal consistency . at the one - loop level @xmath69 and @xmath70",
    "are independent of @xmath2 and the ratio @xmath24 is not quite constant .",
    "however , remarkably at the two - loop level both the ratios @xmath4 and @xmath24 maintain scale independence over a significant range of energies .",
    "turning now to experiments , one has bounds on the higgs mass from precision electroweak data on the w - mass , @xmath71 , and leptonic width of z , as recently reviewed by marciano  @xcite : @xmath72 one also has the lepii bound @xmath73    on the other hand a baysean analysis combining the data from direct and indirect searches for the higgs has been done by dagostini and degrassi  @xcite , which leads them to expect higgs mass to be around 160 - 170 gev with an uncertainty of about 50 to 60 gev .",
    "composite models ( for a review , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) tend to suggest a larger higgs mass than the values obtained in the present work . while it is true that the higgs mechanism for explaining spontaneous symmetry breaking was introduced in analogy with condensed matter physics , it is conceivable that there may be other settings .",
    "there are many geometrical ideas in the subject which have been proposed in the last three decades . here",
    "we shall limit ourselves to brief comments about some results which are phenomenologically interesting .",
    "for example in a version of noncommutative geometry , considered by okumura  @xcite the higgs field along with the gauge field appears as a connection on @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the usual spacetime manifold and @xmath76 is a discrete space .",
    "okumura obtains the coupling constant relation at the unification scale @xmath77 in view of the last inequality there is no grand unification in this model . extrapolating eq .",
    "( [ oku ] ) to lower energies , yields the result @xmath78 for the renormalization group mass .    in another class of theories considered for example by fairlie  @xcite and by manton  @xcite",
    ", the higgs field makes its appearance from dimensional reduction .",
    "a gauge field which should transform as an anti - symmetric tensor under @xmath79 when reduced with respect to the lorentz group @xmath80 can contain lorentz scalars just as a lorentz four vector when reduced with respect to rotations contains a three vector and a three scalar .",
    "reducing for example a gauge field theory in 6 dimensions with internal symmetry of the graded lie group @xmath81 fairlie found @xmath82 and a higgs mass of 426 gev . in these models ,",
    "the higgs self - coupling arises in a manner similar to the quartic coupling of the gauge field from invariance requirements in higher dimensions .    in view of the fact that superstring theories imply higher dimensional theories , these ideas in which higgs makes its presence due to reduction of gauge connections in higher dimensions may be worth re - examining .",
    "yet another class of interesting theories is due to roepstroff and vehns  @xcite . in these theories",
    ", the higgs plays the mathematical role of a super - connection which is an extension of the idea of a usual connection for a gauge field on space - time manifolds . here",
    "again , relations between gauge couplings @xmath20 and @xmath2 are obtained .",
    "for example , in the absence of fermions the model predicts @xmath83 , whereas a refined version which includes fermions as well yields a value of @xmath84 gev .    of course ,",
    "currently most of the phenomenological activity is centered around the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model . while tree level relation puts the lightest higgs to be below the z - mass , radiative corrections puts it at a higher value .",
    "if one solves the standard model renormalization group equations at two - loops as we have done here , and identifies the higgs of the standard model with the lightest higgs of the minimal supersymmetric standard model , one may wish to explore plausible values of the supersymmetry scale @xmath85 as follows .",
    "given @xmath68 , @xmath2 is determined as a function of @xmath5 and one may want to find out at what value of @xmath86 the tree - level relation : @xmath87 is satisfied . if the higgs mass is varied from 115 - 155 gev we find ( setting @xmath88 ) , that @xmath85 varies from something of order a tev at the lower mass end , to a few thousand tev at the higher end .",
    "it would be interesting to carry out a detailed analysis including the effects of the full supersymmetric spectrum .    in summary , it is interesting to note that the scale independence hypothesis leads us to expect a higgs mass of about 150 gev , and this value is quite consistent with the limits obtained from precision electro - weak data .",
    "experimental discovery of the higgs and the determination of its mass at the tevatron in this range remains a distinct possibility .",
    "should the higgs turn out to have a mass of around 150 gev , it would strongly support the scale independence of the coupling constant ratios .          consider a renormalizable field theory involving coupling constants @xmath89 . a functional relation between coupling constants",
    "can arise when there is a symmetry in the lagrangian or even otherwise .",
    "assume now that all couplings are asymptotically free , i.e. , @xmath90 tend to zero as the renormalization scale tends to infinity , and fundamental relations of the type @xmath91 make it possible to express the @xmath92 in terms of @xmath12 .",
    "consider any arbitrary green function of the theory .",
    "one may study the renormalization group transformation property of the green function first in terms of the original theory where @xmath93 are all regarded as independent and the reduced theory written in terms of @xmath12 . comparing the two , consistency demands the relation @xmath94 between the beta functions of the theory .    a number of interesting relations following from eqns .",
    "@xmath95 and @xmath96 have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the context of the standard model however one runs into difficulty , since @xmath97 the coupling corresponding to @xmath98 groups is asymptotically increasing .",
    "in fact , consider a reduction program of @xmath97 in terms of @xmath99 in a power series @xmath100 for three generations the renormalization group equations for @xmath97 and @xmath99 read in the one - loop approximation as @xmath101 using @xmath102 and @xmath103 in @xmath96 finds for the coefficient @xmath104 @xmath105 which has solutions ( a ) @xmath106 ; trivial , or ( b ) @xmath107 ; negative and therefore unacceptable .",
    "this difficulty is circumvented in ref .",
    "@xcite by discarding the reductions hypothesis for @xmath19 and in view of its smallness in relation to @xmath0 the top coupling @xmath1 and the higgs self - coupling @xmath2 incorporate it as a perturbation on other reduction equations .",
    "these procedures lead to very low values for the top - quark mass .",
    "details can be found for example in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare the reduction hypothesis , eq .",
    "@xmath96 in relation to our approach in this paper where we have required the criterion : @xmath108 it follows from eq .",
    "@xmath109 @xmath110 comparing eq .",
    "@xmath111 with eq .",
    "@xmath96 we see that our criterion of scale independence , @xmath109 is consistent with the reduction hypothesis if @xmath112 clearly if @xmath109 is valid , then @xmath113 is valid as well .",
    "thus our scale independence condition is consistent with the reduction hypothesis but is not demanded by it . on the other hand ,",
    "we have seen in fig . 7",
    "that the ratio of the strong coupling @xmath0 and the coupling @xmath1 is scale independent and in fact could be used to determine the top - quark mass within its experimental limits .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that the higgs coupling is also following a similar pattern .",
