    "the spin studies program at rhic has several well defined goals and among them :    * study of the nucleon spin structure , i.e. , how the proton s spin state can be obtained from a superposition of fock states with different numbers of constituents with nonzero spin ; * study how the dynamics of constituent interactions depend on spin ; * understanding the chiral symmetry breaking and helicity non - conservation on quark and hadron levels ; * study of the overall nucleon structure and long range dynamics .",
    "these issues are closely interrelated at the hadron level and the results of the experimental measurements are to be interpreted in terms of hadron spin structure convoluted with the constituent interaction dynamics .    in this paper we discuss the respective physics potential of rhic machine .",
    "studies of the spin effects in inclusive processes probe the spin dependence of the incoherent hadronic interaction dynamics . the cross  sections of the hard production processes are described in the perturbative qcd as a convolution integral of parton cross - sections with the light ",
    "cone parton densities .",
    "these studies would yield information on the contribution of the spin and orbital angular momenta of quarks and gluons into the hadron helicity : @xmath0 in the above sum all terms have clear physical interpretation , however besides the first one , they are gauge and frame dependent .",
    "transparent discussions of the theoretical aspects of this sum rule are given in @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of the single - spin measurements with hadronic final states would be a study where the onset of perturbative qcd regime occurs . in the spin measurements in inclusive process",
    "@xmath1 with polarized hadron @xmath2 this is based on the assumption of the higher  twist origin of the one  spin transverse asymmetries @xcite . the contribution of higher twists should be small at high energies where the interactions at small distances @xmath3 can be studied .",
    "there are some indications that such contributions are small even at not too high energies and @xmath4 values .",
    "in particular , it follows from the recent data on the spin structure function @xmath5 obtained at slac .",
    "if it is the case , the observed significant one - spin asymmetries in hadronic processes are to be associated with manifestation of nonperturbative dynamics",
    ". however , the available energies are not high enough to make the unambiguous conclusion .",
    "therefore , the measurements of one - spin asymmetries at rhic energies are crucial . for the production of hadrons with high @xmath6",
    "the simple factorization is valid for the transversely polarized hadrons as well as for the longitudinally polarized ones @xcite , i.e. @xmath7 and we are expecting vanishing one  spin transverse asymmetries @xmath8 since at the leading twist level @xmath9 .",
    "it can also be demonstrated expressing the asymmetry @xmath10 through the helicity amplitudes . indeed ,",
    "asymmetry @xmath10 results from the interference between helicity amplitudes which differ by one unit of helicity @xmath11 } { \\sum_{x,\\lambda _ x;\\lambda _ 1 \\lambda _ 2}\\int d\\gamma _ x    @xmath12 are the helicity amplitudes of exclusive processes .",
    "if the helicity conservation in qcd for exclusive processes is valid at hadron level @xcite @xmath13 then it follows that @xmath14 in the phase when chiral symmetry is not broken , i.e. in the limit of high @xmath15 s .",
    "note , that @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the number of particles in the exclusive final state @xmath18 .",
    "essential point here is the assumption that at the short distances vacuum is a perturbative one .",
    "thus , the study of @xmath15dependence of one  spin asymmetries might be used as a way to reveal the transition from the non  perturbative phase ( @xmath19 ) to the perturbative phase ( @xmath14 ) of qcd .",
    "the very existence of such transition can not be taken for granted since the vacuum , even at short distances , could be filled with the fluctuations of gluon or quark fields @xcite .",
    "the measurements of one  spin transverse asymmetries in this case will be important probe of the chiral structure of the effective qcd lagrangian .",
    "it should be mentioned that available experimental data are at some variance with pqcd predictions : the data do not at least show up tendency to converge to the vanishing single - spin asymmetries in inclusive and elastic hadron productions .",
    "indeed , in the soft hadronic interactions significant single - spin effects could be expected since the helicity conservation rule does not work in the interactions at large distances because the chiral @xmath20 symmetry of the qcd lagrangian is spontaneously broken . however , the asymmetries at low transverse momentum are small . on the other hand ,",
    "these asymmetries increase at higher transverse momentum ; but this is just where we should expect @xmath14 .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed for the explanation of the observed single - spin effects .",
    "possible sources of the observed one - spin asymmetries could be : higher twist effects @xcite , correlation of @xmath21 and spin in structure @xcite and fragmentation @xcite functions , rotation of valence quarks inside a hadron @xcite and the coherent rotation of the quark matter inside the constituent quarks @xcite .",
    "the main points of the mechanism proposed in @xcite are :    * asymmetry in the pion production reflects the internal spin structure of the constituent quarks , i.e. it arises due to the orbital angular momentum of current quarks inside the constituent quark ; * sign of asymmetry and its value are proportional to polarization of the constituent quark inside the polarized nucleon .",
    "the model predicts significant one - spin asymmetries at high @xmath15 values .",
    "the significant asymmetries appear to show up beyond @xmath22 gev / c ) , i.e. the scale where internal structure of a constituent quark could be probed ( fig .",
    "the observed @xmath15-behavior of asymmetries in inclusive processes confirms these predictions @xcite and indicates that the transverse size @xmath23 of the region where the asymmetries originate from is significantly less than the hadron size @xmath24 and is of the order of the magnitude of the size of constituent quark , i.e. @xmath25    the relevant processes for the study of above problems are the following : @xmath26    as an example we consider charged pion production .",
    "the model @xcite predicts @xmath27 { w_+^h(s,\\xi ) } } { { [ w_+^s ( s,\\xi)+w_+^h(s,\\xi)]}},\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath28 are determined by the interactions at large and small distances .",
    "the asymmetries have energy independent values about 30% at @xmath29 gev / c ) and @xmath30 : @xmath31 note , that the corresponding asymmetry in the neutral pion production has value about @xmath32 in the same kinematical region .    as it has been noted higher twists at rhic energies and high @xmath6 s would not provide significant contribution to asymmetry @xmath10 .",
    "phenomenology of such contributions has not been developed yet and predictions could vary from a few to tens percents .",
    "however , higher twists provide a decreasing single - spin asymmetry at high @xmath6 @xmath33 the same is true for the predictions of the mechanisms discussed in @xcite .    experimental error in asymmetry",
    "@xmath10 is given by the events number @xmath34 and the beam polarization @xmath35 : @xmath36 for the values of rhic luminosity @xmath37 @xmath38 and beam polarization @xmath39 the experimental measurements of single - spin asymmetry in pion production with accuracy of a few percents are feasiable up to @xmath6 about 30 gev / c @xcite .",
    "it would be important to study the processes of the charged pion production since the available data at @xmath40 gev / c indicated that the observed symmetries could be of order of tens percents .",
    "the @xmath40 gev / c is the maximal energy the asymmetries in these processes has been measured so far .",
    "the study of this reaction at rhic energies could provide a clear test of perturbative qcd regime and nonperturbative models . in general",
    ", these studies are important for understanding of the qcd vaccuum and transitions between the perturbative and nonperturbative phases .    in the @xmath41 production",
    "the asymmetries are expected to be smaller due to the isospin substraction between @xmath42 cross sections .",
    "the transverse quark spin density measures the difference of the quark momentum distributions in a transversely polarized nucleon when a quark is polarized parallel or antiparallel to the nucleon .",
    "this quantity @xmath43 , unlike the longitudinal quark spin density @xmath44 , can not be measured in deep inelastic scattering due to its different properties under chiral transformations .",
    "extensive studies of the theoretical aspects of transverse spin structure of the nucleon were made in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "quark transversity is a new observable for understanding the hadron wave function in terms of bare quarks .",
    "gluons give no contribution to the transverse spin of the proton .",
    "it is promising to explore this new spin observable and compare it with the longitudinal spin densities .",
    "recently an upper bound for @xmath43 @xcite : @xmath45 and the bound for @xmath43 limiting its behavior at @xmath46 @xcite : @xmath47 have been obtained .",
    "low-@xmath48 behavior of the spin structure functions @xmath49 and @xmath50 has been considered @xcite in the unitarized chiral quark model which combines ideas on the constituent quark structure of hadrons with a geometrical scattering picture and unitarity .",
    "a nondiffractive singular low-@xmath48 dependence of @xmath51 and @xmath52 was obtained and a diffractive type smooth behaviour of @xmath50 is predicted at small @xmath48 . the quark densities @xmath53 , @xmath44 and @xmath43 at small @xmath54 have the following forms @xcite : @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath57 it also follows that the unpolarized structure function @xmath58 and transversity @xmath59 will be the universal for the proton and neutron , i.e. : @xmath60 and @xmath61 it is also seen that @xmath50 has a smooth behaviour at @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath62 in this limit ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "so far the drell  yan process with transversely polarized protons in the initial state @xmath64 is most suitable for the determination of the quark transversity .",
    "the corresponding two  spin asymmetry is directly related to the quark transversity distributions @xmath43 .",
    "the explicit low-@xmath48 forms eqs .",
    "( [ dg1 ] ) and ( [ dh1 ] ) allow one to analyze the asymmetries @xmath65 and @xmath66 in the central region of the low - mass drell - yan production . they appear to be small at @xmath67 @xmath68 when invariant mass of the lepton pair @xmath69 at the same time the ratio of the asymmetries @xmath70 and @xmath71 is also small in this kinematical region : @xmath72 this result agrees with the predictions made in @xcite . despite the small predicted asymmetries the experimental measurements in this kinematical region could be important",
    ".    the measurements of the two  spin longitudinal asymmetries will probe the gluon contribution @xmath73 to the helicity of the nucleon .",
    "the relevant processes for that purpose are the direct @xmath74 , jets , @xmath75 and pion  production at high @xmath6 s in the collisions of longitudinally polarized protons .",
    "estimation of the experimental sensitivity @xmath76 shows that the measurements with accuracy of a few percents are feasiable at rhic up to @xmath6 about 30 gev / c .",
    "it is evident from deep ",
    "inelastic scattering data that strange quarks alongside with gluons could play essential role in the spin structure of nucleon .",
    "dis data show that strange quarks are negatively polarized in polarized nucleon , @xmath77 .",
    "elastic @xmath78-scattering data as well provide the value @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "the presence and polarization of strange quarks inside a hadron should give an experimental signal in hadronic reactions as well .",
    "we address now the asymmetry in the production of @xmath80-meson consisting of strange quarks .",
    "it is worth to stress that in addition to @xmath81 and @xmath82 quarks the constituent quark ( @xmath83 , for example ) contains pairs of strange quarks and the ratio of scalar density matrix elements @xmath84 is estimated as @xmath85 .",
    "it was argued @xcite that the single spin asymmetry @xmath10 in the process @xmath86 is due to orbital momenta of strange quarks in the internal structure of constituent quarks .",
    "the estimation for the asymmetry @xmath10 in @xmath80-meson production at @xmath87 gev / c ) is : @xmath88 thus , a quite noticeable one - spin asymmetry at high @xmath15 values in inclusive @xmath80-meson production can be expected .",
    "the above estimate also shows that it is reasonable to make experimental measurements of the cross - section and asymmetry in inclusive @xmath80-meson production to study strange content of constituent quark as a possible source of ozi - rule evasion .",
    "as it now is known , only part ( less than one third in fact ) of the proton spin is due to quark spins @xcite .",
    "these results one can interpret in the effective qcd approach ascribing a substantial part of hadron spin to an orbital angular momentum of quark matter . this orbital angular momentum might be revealed when asymmetries in hadron production are measured .",
    "the main role belongs to the orbital angular momentum of @xmath89pairs inside the constituent quark while constituent quarks themselves have very slow ( if at all ) orbital motion and the hadron wave function may be approximated by @xmath90-state of the constituent quark system .",
    "the observed @xmath15dependence of @xmath91hyperon polarization in inclusive processes seems to confirm such conclusions , since it appears to show up beyond @xmath87 gev / c ) i.e. the scale where internal structure of constituent quark can be probed ( fig .",
    "the main outcome of the considered model : polarization of @xmath91  hyperons arises as a result of the internal structure of the constituent quark and its multiple scattering in the some effective field .",
    "it is proportional to the orbital angular momentum of strange quarks which is initially resided inside the constituent quark .",
    "it is predicted in this model that the double spin correlation parameters should have a similar @xmath6-dependence : @xmath92 at @xmath93 gev / c ) and @xmath94 at @xmath95 in the polarized beam fragmentation region in the processes @xmath96 and @xmath97 eqs .",
    "( [ dl1 ] ) , ( [ dl2 ] ) reflect the fact that the polarized strange quark is located inside the constituent quark of a smaller than a hadron size .",
    "it is the generic feature of the above refenced model : spin effects in inclusive processes are related to the internal structure of constituent quark .",
    "this fact could explain similarity in the observed behaviour of different spin observables in inclusive processes , i.e. its rise with @xmath6 at small and medium transverse momenta and then flattening at higher values of @xmath6 .",
    "it would be interesting to check these predictions at rhic energies as well as to measure for the first time triple spin correlation parameters in the processes of hyperon production with two polarized proton beams .",
    "it would help to understand the mechanism of hyperon polarization .",
    "we have considered above the inclusive processes .",
    "spin measurements at rhic with single and both polarized proton beams would probe the fundamental couplings of the underlying lagrangian and investigate the spin structure of the nucleon . a variety of one and two  spin asymmetries could be measured . as it has often happened in the past",
    ", these spin measurements might bring unexpected new results ; this would certainly stimulate the development of new theoretical ideas .    among the spin",
    "studies the most exiting ones are those related to the nonperturbative effects .",
    "asymmetries in fixed angle elastic scattering are predicted to have significant values by several models based on the nonperturbative dynamics @xcite .",
