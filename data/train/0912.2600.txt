    "the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions@xcite are inevitably present in @xmath2 magnetic oxides when the magnetic bonds lack inversion centers , which is the case of the kagome lattice .",

    "the dzyaloshinskii - moriya forces tend to reduce the spin fluctuations and may therefore be detrimental to the long - searched spin - liquid phases",
    ". however , would the heisenberg phase be gapped , such as in valence bond crystals ( generalized spin - peierls states ) or in topological spin liquids,@xcite then it would be robust against perturbations typically smaller than the gap .",
    "an example is given by the shastry - sutherland compound srcu@xmath3(bo@xmath4)@xmath3 which remains in the singlet phase in the presence of dzyaloshinskii - moriya couplings.@xcite in the kagome antiferromagnet ( with pure nearest neighbor heisenberg interaction ) , the very existence of a gap remains an open question,@xcite algebraic spin liquid and gapless vortex phases have been proposed as alternatives in the recent years.@xcite current numerical estimates of the gap provide a small upper bound @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite in any case the gap ( if it exists ) could be smaller than the dzyaloshinskii - moriya coupling ( especially in copper oxides where it is typically @xmath6 ) and the latter is therefore particularly relevant .",

    "the caveat is that the actual schwinger - boson mean - field solution for the @xmath2 , @xmath13 kagome antiferromagnet is already long - ranged ordered , and it is only at smaller values of @xmath14 ( which in this approach is a continuous parameter ) that a disordered spin - liquid phase is stabilized .",

    "a simple way to derive the 3/2 factor ( see , however , a. auerbach , _ interacting electrons and quantum magnetism _ , springer - verlag , 1994 for the discussion of the @xmath175 corrections ) is to use the wick theorem : @xmath176 at @xmath13 , the hamiltonian is @xmath101 invariant and we obtain @xmath177 . for @xmath178 , @xmath179 . at finite @xmath92 and for sufficiently small boson density , the problem is strictly equivalent to gapped spinons ( the schwinger bosons ) interacting with a fluctuating bond field .",
    "it has been understood that the low - energy physics of such a system will be that of a lattice gauge theory coupled to charged matter fields .",
    "but the nature ( group ) of the gauge field crucially depends on the lattice geometry , and in the present case where the lattice is not bipartite , it should generically be of @xmath98 type , and has two types of phases.@xcite if the effective @xmath98 gauge theory is in a deconfined phase ( which should be the case for large enough @xmath92 ) , the ground - state is qualitatively close to the mean - field one , with gapped and unconfined spinons . if the phase is instead confined , the gauge fluctuations are strong and can not be neglected , the mean - field picture is not valid any more",
