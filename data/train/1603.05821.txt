    "the intense evaporation of a drop close to a hot surface can generate an insulating vapor layer which prevents boiling and over which the drop levitates , thereby featuring a high mobility  @xcite .",
    "this so - called leidenfrost effect was studied extensively in the middle of @xmath0 century by the pharmacist boutigny who considered leidenfrost drops as a new state of matter called the spheroidal state and deemed it essential to describe the birth of the universe  @xcite . far from being crucial in this regard , there is a renewal of interest nowadays for the leidenfrost effect because of self - propelling behaviors  @xcite , nanofabrication possibilities  @xcite and chemical reactor capabilities  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the leidenfrost effect still leaves several important questions open such as that of the friction force experienced by these drops  @xcite .",
    "the levitation occurs when the temperature of the substrate exceeds a given temperature .",
    "the prediction of this critical leidenfrost temperature is still an open question too , and even its definition is still subject to debate .",
    "indeed , it is sometimes defined as the minimal temperature of the substrate for the leidenfrost effect to occur  @xcite , or as the temperature for which the lifetime of the drops is the largest  @xcite . recently",
    ", it has been proved that the texturation of solid surfaces strongly impacts the value of the leidenfrost temperature  @xcite .",
    "vakarelski  _ et  al .",
    "_ showed that when a hot textured and superhydrophobic sphere is immersed in a water pool at @xmath1c , a vapour film is maintained until the sphere reaches the pool temperature without transition to nucleate boiling  @xcite .",
    "kwon  _ et  al .",
    "_ reported that sparse surface textures increase the leidenfrost point because they promote droplet wetting via capillary wicking  @xcite .",
    "finally , kruse and coworkers found that the leidenfrost point can be increased by 175@xmath2c thanks to a femtosecond laser surface processing  @xcite .",
    "thus , should one want to favor the leidenfrost effect , the ideal substrate that one could imagine is molecularly smooth .",
    "accordingly , a liquid substrate appears to be a good candidate .",
    "few studies already considered the problem of a drop levitating in a leidenfrost state above a hot liquid pool .",
    "however , these studies were restricted to liquid nitrogen drops  @xcite and none of them were focused on the question of the critical leidenfrost temperature under these conditions .",
    "mm and the pool is at @xmath3c while the boiling point of ethanol is @xmath4c .",
    "( image credit : florence cavagnon),width=302 ]    in this paper , we are concerned with a leidenfrost drop placed above a hot liquid pool .",
    "our goal is to broadly tackle this problem by addressing the question of the critical leidenfrost temperature in this situation and providing a better understanding as for the interaction between the drop and its liquid substrate . in parallel",
    ", the differences between liquid and solid substrates will be highlighted as far as the leidenfrost effect is concerned .",
    "first , we describe the experimental setup and the developed model in section  [ sec : methods ] . in section  [ sec : results ] , the main results obtained are presented , the experimental findings being confronted with the model . then , in section  [ sec : considerations ] , some details about the limitations of our analysis as well as the associated perspectives are discussed .",
    "finally , conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the experimental setup is the following : a drop of a radius @xmath5 ( as viewed from above ) is released above a hot pool of another liquid ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : setup_theory ] and supplementary material ) .",
    "the pool is maintained at a temperature @xmath6 thanks to a heating plate , a pid controller and a thermocouple that is immersed in the pool close to its surface .",
    "the temperature uncertainty is @xmath7c coming from the precision of the device and small variations that can occur during the evaporation of one drop .",
    "the boiling point of the drop is denoted as @xmath8 .",
    "the difference between the temperature of the pool and the boiling temperature of the liquid of the drop is denoted as @xmath9 and will always be positive throughout this paper .",
    "thus , @xmath10 will be called the superheat .",
    "experiments were carried out with drops released at ambient temperature and at @xmath8 , showing no difference of behavior except a better stability at low superheats .",
    "the density , surface tension and dynamic viscosity are denoted respectively by @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 for the drop liquid and @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the liquid of the pool .",
    "thus , we introduce the capillary length of the drop as @xmath17 and that of the pool as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the gravity acceleration .",
    "the study focuses on ethanol drops over silicone oil pools .",
    "indeed , silicone oil enables heating the pool up to roughly @xmath20c and is practically non - volatile as compared to other liquids at these temperatures .",
    "the boiling temperature of ethanol is @xmath21c .",
    "that allows us to work with superheats ranging from @xmath22c to about @xmath23c .",
    "the depth , length and width of the liquid pool are more than ten times larger than the drop radius and can be thus considered as practically infinite . indeed , no difference in behavior has been observed for different sizes of the container as soon as the depth remains larger than the deformation of the pool surface .",
    "two types of measurements were taken .",
    "first , we captured the deformations of the surface of the pool from the side with a telecentric lens .",
    "these experiments validate the model developped hereafter .",
    "second , we recorded the maximum radius of the drop from the top as a function of time in order to quantify the evaporation rate of the drops .          in order to model the experimental phenomena",
    ", we consider an axisymmetric drop levitating above a hot liquid pool ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup_theory ] ) .",
    "the liquid pool is assumed to be non - volatile and isothermally maintained at a temperature @xmath6 larger than the boiling point of the drop @xmath8 .",
    "the size of the drop is measured by its maximum radius @xmath5 , as seen from above .",
    "the vertical position @xmath24 of the drop bottom and pool interfaces , which are functions of the radial coordinate @xmath25 , are denoted as @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the difference of these two quantities , namely the thickness of the vapor film , is denoted @xmath28 .",
    "the level @xmath29 is chosen at the unperturbed liquid pool surface , expected to be attained far away from the drop , and hence @xmath30 as @xmath31 .",
    "notationwise , note that here and throughout this paper , the presence or the absence of a tilde is meant to distinguish between dimensionless and dimensional quantities , respectively .",
    "lengths are made dimensionless by the capillary length of the drop liquid @xmath32 , whereas the excess pressure quantities to be introduced below are adimensionalized with the scale @xmath33 . as the evaporation of leidenfrost drops is typically long compared to thermal and viscous relaxation times",
    ", we are looking for steady shapes only ( quasi - steady approximation ) .    concerning the shape of the drop , the model proposed is based on the one presented in sobac  _ et  al . _",
    "two different regions are distinguished .",
    "the upper part of the drop , above the vapor film ( beyond the patching point shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup_theory ] ) , is assumed to be an equilibrium shape , for which the laplace pressure @xmath34 ( with @xmath35 the curvature of the drop surface ) locally balances ( up to a constant ) the hydrostatic pressure @xmath36 . in dimensionless form , this simply reads    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the dimensionless curvature at the top of the drop ( @xmath39 ) , which is here used as a free parameter controlling the drop size . for a given @xmath38 , numerically integrating this differential equation ( @xmath40 being a function of the drop shape and its derivatives ) from the symmetry axis yields the corresponding equilibrium shape and in particular the value of the maximum radius @xmath41 .",
    "note that the choice of @xmath42 affects only the vertical position of the resulting equilibrium shape , but not the shape itself or the value of @xmath43 ( which depends only upon @xmath38 ) .",
    "this is important since the value of @xmath42 remains unspecified at this stage and is eventually determined only together with the overall shape of the leidenfrost drop .",
    "this  upper equilibrium drop \" solution is assumed to be valid up to a point located at @xmath44 , where non - equilibrium effects of evaporation and viscous pressure losses in the vapor flow start to progressively come into play . in this  vapor layer region \"",
    "@xmath45 , the thickness of the vapor film and its slopes are small enough so as to use the lubrication approximation .",
    "furthermore , the slopes of the drop bottom and pool interfaces are here both considered to be small .",
    "the gas itself is assumed to be composed of pure vapor ( no air ) , incompressible and its properties are taken as constant .",
    "then , ignoring possible motions inside the drop ( following  @xcite ) , the excess pressure ( over the ambient one ) in the vapor film is found from the balance of forces normal to the drop surface as @xmath46 .",
    "this excess pressure drives a stokes flow with a volumetric flux @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the vapor dynamic viscosity .",
    "note the coefficient @xmath49 in the mobility factor , reflecting of no - slip conditions imposed at both the drop and liquid pool interfaces .",
    "assuming that heat is only transferred by conduction across the film , the local evaporation flux at the interface is expressed as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the vapor thermal conductivity , @xmath52 is the latent heat of vaporization , and @xmath53 is as before the superheat . finally , the vapor mass conservation under the lubrication hypothesis reads @xmath54 ( assuming quasisteadiness ) , where @xmath55 is the vapor density . combining these results , scaling all lengths with @xmath32 and assuming the axial symmetry yields the following equation :    @xmath56    with an evaporation number @xmath57 defined by    @xmath58    as for the curvature @xmath40 , it is here left as a full - form expression    @xmath59    with no small - slope simplifications applied .",
    "the reason is that such a full expression proves to eventually provide for a smoother numerical matching with the upper part of the drop .",
    "appart from the size @xmath43 of the drop , @xmath57 is an other parameter of the dimensionless problem and depends on the fluid properties and on the superheat @xmath53 .",
    "while the liquid properties are taken at @xmath60 , the vapor properties are here evaluated at the mean temperature of the vapor film , @xmath61 .",
    "four boundary conditions are needed to supplement eqs  ( [ lubrication_equation ] ) and ( [ curvature ] ) : symmetry conditions at @xmath62 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath63 and @xmath64 , while at @xmath65 the solution must match with the earlier obtained upper equilibrium shape of the drop , _",
    "i.e. _ we require the continuity of @xmath66 and of @xmath67 .",
    "the continuity of @xmath68 itself here merely amounts to finding the appropriate vertical shift of the upper equilibrium shape , _",
    "i.e. _ to determining the value of @xmath42 ( cf . above ) .",
    "the liquid pool surface shape is assumed to be predominantly governed by a balance between hydrostatic and capillary pressures , as well as by the pressure exerted by the vapor film . in dimensionless form , this reads    @xmath69    where the curvature expression is here written assuming small slopes . the dimensionless excess pressure in the vapor film is given by @xmath70 at @xmath71 .",
    "on the other hand , we expect @xmath72 at @xmath73 . note that @xmath74 thereby defined is actually continuous at @xmath44 .",
    "indeed , @xmath75 and @xmath40 are continuous at @xmath44 ( see the boundary conditions above ) , and @xmath76 must vanish where the equilibrium shape is attached , quite in accordance with eq.([topequilibriumdropshape_equation ] ) . for @xmath77 , eq.([eq_pool ] )",
    "can thus be simplified to @xmath78 , with an analytical solution @xmath79 satisfying the condition at infinity . here",
    "@xmath80 is the modified bessel function of the second kind and @xmath81 is an unknown coefficient to be determined . in the interval @xmath82 ,",
    "the following boundary conditions are used to solve eq.([eq_pool ] ) : the symmetry condition at @xmath62 , _ i.e. _ @xmath83 , while at @xmath84 the solution must match with the above analytical solution , _",
    "i.e. _ we require the continuity of @xmath85 and of @xmath86 . note that it is indeed three boundary conditions that are needed here for the second - order differential equation , for @xmath81 is also an unknown .    the problem given in the interval @xmath45 by eqs ( [ lubrication_equation ] ) , ( [ curvature ] ) , ( [ eq_pool ] ) with the formulated boundary conditions is discretized in a standard way by second - order finite differences on a uniform grid .",
    "the resulting nonlinear algebraic system of equations for the values @xmath75 , @xmath40 , @xmath87 at the grid points as well as the values of @xmath42 and @xmath81 is solved by the newton - raphson method .",
    "it is checked _ a posteriori _ that the choice of the patching point @xmath88 has no significant influence on the results .",
    "if we release a drop of ethanol ( boiling point @xmath89c ) on an oil pool at @xmath90 , it contacts the surface of the pool and form a liquid lens .",
    "however , if the temperature of the pool is above @xmath60 , a drop like the one shown in fig .",
    "[ figures / photoflo ] can be observed .",
    "this figure shows an ethanol drop of @xmath91 mm in radius levitating over a pool of silicone oil v20 at @xmath92c .",
    "erythrosine has been added to the ethanol for a better visualisation .",
    "we clearly distinguish that the drop stands above the deformed surface of a liquid pool and keeps an almost spherical shape . for larger drops ,",
    "the deformation of the pool surface is observed to be more significant .",
    "drop radii up to @xmath93 mm could be experimentally reached .",
    "however , for such large drops , even a small perturbation induces their contact with the pool . on the other hand ,",
    "the large drops become more stable when larger superheats are used in the experiments . over time , the radius of the levitating drop decreases for about a minute . when the drop becomes very small ( @xmath94 mm ) ,",
    "the drop contacts the liquid pool forming a liquid lens which quickly evaporates .",
    "thus , the end of life of the drop is different between the cases of a liquid substrate and of a solid substrate for which a take - off behavior is observed  @xcite .",
    "observing the leidenfrost effect for a superheat as low as @xmath95c is a feat that is never seen on a solid substrate but turns out to be possible on a liquid pool .",
    "thus , in this sense , a liquid seems to offer an ideal substrate to study the leidenfrost effect .    as in the case of a solid substrate ,",
    "the drops are highly mobile due to the presence of the vapor film , at least for small - sized drops when the pool deformation is not too strong .",
    "many parameters seem to influence such mobility , including the temperature of the pool and the radius of the drops .",
    "we also observe that the drops are repelled by positive menisci that emerge from the pool , _",
    "e.g. _ those induced by the walls of the container . on the contrary ,",
    "they are attracted by objects that dig the surface of the pool as cereals do at the surface of a bowl of milk  @xcite .",
    "thus , when two drops are on the same pool , they attract each other until coalescing .",
    "sometimes , it happens that such coalescence is delayed for a few seconds .",

    "figure  [ fig : dropshapes](a ) shows typical shapes of ethanol leidenfrost drops over a silicone oil pool computed by our model for various drop sizes .",
    "it is seen that smaller drops are quasi - spherical , whereas larger ones are flattened at the top by gravity .",
    "this transition between spheres and puddles occurs when gravity overcomes the capillary forces .",
    "typically , the effect of gravity on the drop shape can be disregarded when the dimensionless drop radius @xmath43 is well smaller than one . at the same time , under the drop , the liquid pool adopts a concave shape which becomes increasingly marked with the drop size .",
    "the larger is the drop size , the deeper it is immersed in the pool ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : pooldeformation ] ) .",
    "next , we numerically investigate the shape of the vapor film by considering the radial variation of its thickness @xmath102 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dropshapes](b ) .",
    "@xmath102 is defined as the thickness of the vapor film projected perpendicularly to the pool surface as @xmath103 .",
    "it is seen that the thickness profile forms a pronounced depression near the outer edge , referred to as the neck .",
    "the vapor layer can thus be view as composed of a vapor pocket at its center , surrounded by an annular neck region .",
    "the film thickness at the neck location appears to increase with the drop size . for @xmath104 ,",
    "the pictured profile of the vapor film thickness is similar to the one obtained in the situation of a leidenfrost drop over a flat substrate  @xcite , which is not astonishing given the fact that the substrate is only weakly deformed in this case . for these small drop sizes ,",
    "the depth of the vapor pocket increases with the drop size .",
    "however , for @xmath105 , the depth of the vapor pocket gets slightly lower and then reincreases . for these large drop sizes , the shape of the vapor pocket proves to become more complex , somewhat flattened and wavy .",
    "it is important to notice that calculations have been performed until @xmath106 and no sign of chimney formation has been observed until then .",
    "in contrast , for leidenfrost drops over a flat substrate , the vapor pocket depth is found to increase sharply as @xmath107 is approached , and no meaningful solution is obtained for larger @xmath108  @xcite , which must actually correspond to a chimney formation by a rayleigh - taylor - like mechanism  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the maximum drop radius that we could observe on a liquid pool is @xmath109 , which was achieved by injecting liquid in a drop already stable on the pool . above that radius , even though no sign of chimney is observed , the drops tend to contact the surface of the pool due to perturbations such as capillary waves at their surfaces .",

    "it shows the vapor film thicknesses at the neck @xmath112 and at the center @xmath113 as a function of the evaporation number and the drop size .",
    "one observes in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling](a ) that the thickness of the vapor film at the neck follows the scaling law @xmath114 whatever the drop size .",
    "the same trend and exponent have been found for a leidenfrost drop on a solid substrate  @xcite .",
    "the variation of the thickness of the vapor film at the neck with the drop radius shows different trends for small and large drops ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling](c ) ) .",
    "this observation is also similar to the solid - substrate case .",
    "hence , the nature of the substrate does not seem to be crucial for the behavior of the thickness of the vapor film at the neck .",
    "however , this observation does not hold for its thickness at the center . on the one hand , for moderately small drop sizes @xmath115 , we notice that the tendencies shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling](b , d ) for the liquid substrate are still roughly the same as those found in @xcite for a solid substrate .",

    "indeed , in the case of a flat substrate , large drops adopt a puddle shape which verifies @xmath148 .",
    "such a difference results from the fact that large drops over a liquid do not experience saturation in thickness , but continue to penetrate into the pool as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : dropshapes](a ) .",
    "the fits of the curves @xmath149 , such as shown in fig .  [ figures : rvst_ethanol ] , by eq.([eq : rvst_general ] ) allow to estimate the reduced lifetime of the drops @xmath150 , which can serve as an indicator of the evaporation rate of the drops .",

    "the solid line indicates the scaling law @xmath155.,width=302 ]    the reason for the discrepancy at smaller superheats is not completely clear .",
    "however , it may be due to the fact that the evaporation from the upper part of the drop , neglected in the present analysis against the evaporation through the vapor film , becomes nonetheless relatively significant at smaller superheats .",
    "this evaporation , on the first order , depends on the gradient of temperature between the temperature of the drop @xmath60 and the room temperature , which does not depend on the temperature of the pool and thus explains the saturation at low superheats .",
    "this evaporation can be neglected when the superheat is large as the evaporation below the drop becomes significant , but not when the superheat is low . in the case of a solid substrate ,",
    "this saturation can not be observed because the leidenfrost temperature is much higher than the crossover between the two regimes .",
    "the death of a leidenfrost drop on a hot liquid pool is different of the one on a solid substrate . indeed , on a solid substrate , celestini  _ et  al .",
    "_ showed that a leidenfrost drop experiences a take - off at the end of its lifetime  @xcite . in our case , for a sufficiently small radius , the drop is rather observed to contact the pool , as already mentionned .",
    "such a critical drop radius depends on the superheat and even on the initial radius .",
    "for instance , one observes in fig .",
    "[ figures : rvst_ethanol](a ) that for @xmath156c , the levitated state exists up to a radius of about @xmath157 mm whereas for @xmath158c , the drop survives in a levitated state up to a really small radius .",
    "however , the data is rather scattered and no quantitative tendency can be found ( see supplementary material ) .",
    "one can notice that for a drop radius around @xmath159 mm , and a superheat of @xmath160c ( @xmath161 ) , the thickness of the vapor layer at the neck becomes of the order of one micron ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] ) which becomes close to the case where van der waals forces comes into play .",
    "finally , the contact leads to a liquid lens that is very quickly evaporated .",
    "the presented model actually treats the substrate as an ideal deformable substrate , _",
    "i.e. _ the pool is assumed to be isothermal and no flow develops inside . as a consequence ,",
    "the influence of the pool viscosity and thermal properties is not considered in the model .",
    "therefore , even if our model appears to rather correctly capture the main mechanisms of the phenomenon , it has inherent limitations which will be discused in this section .",
    "the only properties of the pool accounted for in the model are its density and surface tension , whose influence will also be investigated .",
    "figures  [ fig : densitysurfacetension ] present the results of a parametric study highlighting the role of the ratios of the densities and of the surface tensions of the liquids of the pool and of the drop on the geometry of the pool and drop surfaces .",
    "one notices ( fig .",
    "[ fig : densitysurfacetension ] ) that an increase of @xmath162 or @xmath163 naturally makes the situation closer to a leidenfrost drop on a flat surface .",
    "of course , these changes also alter the evaporation , and , for very high values of @xmath162 or @xmath163 , the evaporation flux also gets closer to that of a leidenfrost drop on a flat solid substrate",
    ". however , practically , fluids densities and surface tensions are never sufficiently different to reach this extreme case . on the contrary ,",
    "a decrease of these ratios leads to an increase of the pool deformation and thus a deeper immersion of the drop inside the pool .     with @xmath110 ( corresponding to a drop of ethanol over a pool of silicone oil v20 at @xmath100c).,width=302 ]",
    "interestingly , large drops deeply immersed with a virtually flat surface at their top are also encountered in the case of delayed coalesce of large floating oil drop over a pool of the same liquid  @xcite . in our study , for the case of the drops that are deeply immersed , we do not observe drops with their upper part fully below @xmath29 , either experimentally or numerically .",
    "as an example of drops with a deeper immersion , we released drops of hfe7100 over the same silicone oil pool as previously ( @xmath164 and @xmath165 ) .",
    "the largest drops we were able to observe experimentally had a radius @xmath166 , and they were always emerging above the pool base level .",
    "we performed experiments similar to the case presented above with drops of ethanol on hot pools of silicone oils of various viscosities .",
    "a leidenfrost effect has been observed for a dynamic viscosity of the pool @xmath167 up to @xmath168 @xmath169 .",
    "in contrast , we could never observe a leidenfrost effect for drops on a hot pool of silicone oil with a dynamic viscosity @xmath167 larger than @xmath170 unless the liquid of the drop is heated at its boiling temperature before being deposited on the surface .",
    "this absence of leidenfrost effect for highly viscous liquid substrates and the fact that the preheating helps the drops to stay in the leidenfrost state strongly suggest that the convection in the pool is somehow important for the leidenfrost state to be maintained . supposedly , the convection in the pool may not be sufficient to prevent the cooling of its surface under the drop for highly viscous oils . in fig .",
    "[ figures / viscosity](a ) , we plot the maximum lifetime @xmath171 observed for ethanol drops ( initial radius @xmath172 mm ) , _ i.e. _ the maximum of the lifetimes of three different drops in the same conditions , as a function of the superheat @xmath10 for differents types of oil .",
    "this maximum lifetime decreases monotonically as the superheat increases .",
    "we also see that the curves are quite similar except for the substrate made of silicone oil  v1.5 .",

    "( b ) associated leidenfrost temperature @xmath173 of these drops as a function of the dynamic viscosity @xmath167 of the oil of the pool at the leidenfrost temperature .",
    "the continuous and dashed lines represent the boiling temperature of the ethanol and its leidenfrost point on an aluminum substrate respectively  @xcite .",
    "the hatched blue zone is the zone where it is hard to find any liquid and the hatched pink zone is the zone where we did not observe stable leidenfrost drops.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "[ figures / viscosity](b ) , we plot the associated leidenfrost temperature @xmath173 for each of the pool liquids used as a function of their dynamic viscosity @xmath167 .",
    "we also indicate the boiling temperature ( solid line ) as well as the leidenfrost temperature for an ethanol drop on an aluminum substrate ( dashed line ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath174c  @xcite .",
    "one observes that the leidenfrost temperature is very low and practically does not vary in the range of the pool viscosities used .",
    "the hatched blue zone is the zone where very few liquids exist ( _ e.g. _ liquid nitrogen , @xmath175 ) .",
    "in addition , most of these liquids have a low boiling point and can not be used as a heated substrate for a leidenfrost drop . the hatched zone in pink",
    "is the zone where we hardly observe any leidenfrost drop .",
    "therefore , we see that the leidenfrost temperature is very stable for ethanol in large range of substrates viscosities .",
    "depositing a leidenfrost drop over the surface of the pool leads to a local alteration of the heat transfer , which may result in a marangoni flow in the pool .",
    "a similar phenomenon has been extensively studied by savino  _ et  al .",
    "_ in the case of a drop deposited on a slightly hotter pool ( about @xmath176c )  @xcite .",
    "they proved that the marangoni flow can delay the drop coalescence for a few seconds .",
    "however , in the case studied by savino  _ et  al .",
    "_ , the levitation never persists when the superheat reaches less than @xmath177c .",
    "furthermore , the coalescence can be delayed in the best case for @xmath178 s , while our large drops can levitate up to @xmath179 s.    moreover , experiments that are not shown here show that there exists flows in the pool under the drop . however , depending on the liquid ( ethanol or hfe7100 ) , the flow at the surface of the pool is directed either towards the drop or away from it ( resp . ) .",
    "thus , there exist cases in which the marangoni effect in the pool is not sufficient to increase the pressure under the drop ( _ e.g. _ hfe7100 ) and can not be responsible for the levitation .",
    "however , as there exists some flows in the pool , further study is needed to fully clarify their impact on the phenomenon .",
    "considering these facts and the satisfying agreement between our model and the experimental data , the full consideration of the impacts of the marangoni effect is beyond the scope of this paper , but should be consider in further studies .",
    "we have experimentally and theoretically studied leidenfrost drops placed over a hot liquid pool and stressed the importance of the nature of the substrate on the leidenfrost effect .",
    "we showed experimentally that over a pool , a leidenfrost state is possible as soon as the liquid of the pool is just hotter than the drop boiling point , with no apparent leidenfrost threshold .",
    "this is at least partly due to the fact that a liquid substrate has no roughness unlike the solid ones .",
    "the early apparition of a leidenfrost effect on a liquid pool is a phenomenon which is of primary importance regarding the extinction of pool fires and the spray cooling of hot baths .",
    "experiments have also revealed that the final stage of the drop life is quite different over the liquid pool and solid substrates : instead of a take - off over the latter , a sufficiently small drop simply contacts onto the former .",
    "the maximum depth of the pool surface deformation predicted by the lubrication - type model is in agreement with measurements . scaling laws concerning the shape of the vapor film",
    "are also predicted .",
    "another difference between liquid and solid substrates , established theoretically , is that over the former no chimney formation is predicted for relatively large leidenfrost drops of the size for which it is definitely expected over the latter , _",
    "i.e. _ above 4 times the drop capillary - length .",
    "the dynamics of evaporation of these drops has been studied and the developed model yields a reasonable agreement with experiments except for small superheats for which we show that the evaporation through the vapor film ceases to be the predominant one .",
    "the nature of the substrate also changes the shape of large drops , saturating in height over a solid substrate ( puddles ) but not over a liquid one , which is due to deformation of the pool surface itself under the weight of the drop .",
    "the effect of the ratios of the surface tensions and of the densities of the liquids involved is also tackled and these ratios are seen to lead to a more solid - like case at some extremes or to a more liquid - like case .",
    "this study leaves several questions open such as the nature of the death of leidenfrost droplets over a liquid substrate and the influence of the viscosity of the pool and of the marangoni flows therein . finally , we hope that this work also opens the way to further studies such as the impact of volatile drops on a hot pool or the particular mobility of these drops and ways to control or exploit it",
