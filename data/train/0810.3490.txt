    "an important part of the program to study cp  violation is the measurement of the angle @xmath4 of the unitarity triangle related to the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark - mixing matrix  @xcite .",
    "measurement of @xmath0 performed with tree - level processes defines an experimentally allowed region for the apex of the unitarity triangle .",
    "this region should overlap with the region obtained from @xmath5 and @xmath6 mixing , assuming there are no significant new - physics contributions in the mixing amplitude . with this assumption ,",
    "current tevatron measurements  @xcite of the @xmath6 mixing rate yield an indirect constraint on @xmath0 that is much tighter than direct measurements  @xcite .",
    "therefore , precise direct determination of @xmath0 presents an opportunity to conduct an accurate test of the standard model .    the decays @xmath7 can be used to measure @xmath0 with essentially no hadronic uncertainties , exploiting interference between the  and  amplitudes of the decays @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "interference takes place when the @xmath2 meson to indicate any linear combination of a @xmath10 and a @xmath11 meson state . ]",
    "is observed in a final state @xmath12 that is accessible to both @xmath10 and @xmath11 decays .",
    "such measurements can be conducted with quite a few @xmath2 and @xmath3 decay modes , including those with excited charm and strange mesons , involving different methods for constructing and optimizing cp - violation observables and measuring parameters related to @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , there has been a healthy stream of new ideas in this area since the basic method was first proposed in 1991  @xcite .",
    "the different parameters of the various measurements are then combined statistically , yielding confidence intervals for @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the statistical sensitivity provided by each mode and method is generally poor , mainly due to the strong ckm suppression ( and , for most modes  @xcite , color suppression ) in the transition .",
    "this necessitates the exploitation of as many modes and methods as possible , in order to achieve a small combined error on @xmath0 .    the most accurate @xmath0 measurement method to date determines @xmath0 by analyzing the @xmath2-decay event distribution in @xmath13 with multibody @xmath2 decays  @xcite .",
    "this method was initially applied to the cabibbo - favored decay @xmath14",

    "by contrast , the  measurement with @xmath23 used both @xmath24 and @xmath22 .",
    "for that mode , the total decay rate @xmath22 gave more precise information about the cp - violation parameters than the phase - space distribution @xmath24 . while most measurements and sensitivity estimates have focused on use of @xmath24 for learning about @xmath0 , it is important to identify and study the decay modes for which the total decay rate has competitive sensitivity to the cp - violation parameters .",
    "this will help ensure that all useful modes are utilized for measuring @xmath0 , while preventing much effort from being wasted on data analysis of decay modes that are not promising .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide the tools for estimating the cp - parameter sensitivities of measurements of the absolute decay rates @xmath22 for different @xmath2 decay modes .",
    "we demonstrate that a good estimate of the sensitivities is provided by a single mode - dependent parameter .",
    "the impact of each mode on the combined error of @xmath0 depends on values of strong phases and decay distributions that in many cases are not well known yet .",
    "however , our general analysis of the sensitivities , performed in terms of cp - violation parameters similar to those used in the most accurate experimental analyses to date , provides a good indication as to when using the integrated decay rates is expected to improve the overall precision on @xmath0 .",
    "since the combined error on @xmath0 depends on many measurements , its full estimation is not within the scope of this paper and is not attempted here .",
    "rather , we compare the sensitivity of the absolute - rate analysis to that of the current - best phase - space - distribution analysis using comparable experimental cp - violation variables .",
