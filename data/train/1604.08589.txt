    "prominent infrared ( ir ) emission bands between 3 and 20 m  are observed in many astronomical environments .",
    "these spectral features are attributed to the vibrational fluorescence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , which are electronically excited by ultraviolet ( uv ) photons .",
    "pah molecules are composed of a hexagonal honeycomb carbon lattice , typically containing 50 - 100 carbon atoms , with a dusting of hydrogen atoms about the periphery .",
    "compact structures are generally the most stable , but a variety of pah shapes and sizes are expected to exist in space @xcite .",
    "the strongest pah emission bands are observed at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.2 , and 12.7 m. a variety of weaker bands are also seen in the observational spectra ( at , e.g. , 11.0 , 12.0 and 13.5 , 14.2 , 16.4 m ) .",
    "the pah bands can be associated with the following vibrations : c - h stretching ( 3.3 m ) ; c - c stretching ( 6.2 m ) ; c - c stretching and c - h in - plane bending ( 7.7 , 8.6 m ) ; and c - h out - of - plane bending ( hereafter ch@xmath0pah bands in the 10 - 15 m  region ) .",
    "it is the number of adjacent c - h groups that determines the wavelength of the emission in the 10 - 15 m  region , i.e.solo , duo , trio and quartet c - h groups .",
    "the relative emission intensities in these bands are known to be highly variable between sources and within individual resolved objects ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the charge state of the pah population has been identified in laboratory studies as the most important parameter in driving variations in the relative emission intensities , sometimes reaching one order of magnitude between charge states @xcite .",
    "likewise , the profiles are known to vary in shape and peak position , which have been linked to object type ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the variability of the pah profiles is thought to represent differences in pah sub - populations , possibly in , e.g. , size or structure ( e.g. @xcite ; see @xcite for a detailed overview ) .",
    "decomposing the pah emission bands with a mixture of functions ( e.g. gaussians , lorentzians , drude profiles ) is one way to investigate the origins of the observed spectral variability @xcite .",
    "a recent result by peeters et al . ( 2015 ) showed that the 7.7 and 8.6 m  emission bands can be decomposed into four gaussian components , revealing that at least two pah sub - populations contributed to this emission .",
    "motivated by this result , we apply here a similar approach to the 11 m  emission complex ( i.e. , both the 11.0 and 11.2 m  bands ) and the 12.7 m  emission complex . since the variations of the 11 and 12.7 m  complexes are relatively minor when compared to the 7.7 and 8.6 m  emission bands , it is critical to examine high spectral resolution observations .",
    "in addition , if band substructure indeed traces pah sub - populations , the astronomical data considered must span a sufficiently wide swath of physical conditions , such that any intrinsic differences are reflected in the observational band profiles .",
    "we present here new decompositions of the 11 and 12.7 m  emission complexes in high - resolution _",
    "spitzer_/irs maps of rne and a star - forming region in order to understand the pah sub - populations that produce the blended emission bands .",
    "we organize the paper as follows : the targets , observations , and continuum determination are presented in section  [ sec : obs ] . the spectral variability in the spectra prior to any further analysis are examined in section  [ sec : specprof ] .",
    "we introduce new methods for decomposing the 11 and 12.7 m  pah emission bands in section  [ sec : methods ] .",
    "results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] and we discuss the implications of these results in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we present a brief summary in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we chose targets with _ spitzer_/irs - sh maps that exhibit strong emission in the 11 and 12.7 m  pah complexes .",
    "the chosen sources were the rne ngc 7023 , ngc 2023 ( two pointings  north and south ) , and the star - forming region m17 .",

    "these data were processed by the _ spitzer _ science center ( pipeline version s18.7 ) .",
    "further processing was accomplished with the ` cubism ` tool @xcite , including coaddition and bad pixel cleaning . for the purpose of spectral extraction , a @xmath5-pixel aperture was stepped across each map .",
    "this ensured that the extraction apertures matched the point - spread function , removing non - independent pixels .",
    "further details of the reduction process can be found in @xcite .",
    "a similar approach was applied in the reduction of the sh maps of ngc 7023 and m17 .",
    "the map of ngc 7023 has been previously analyzed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "_ spitzer_/irs observations of m17-sw have been previously examined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "extinction is small in ngc 2023 , as are the variations in extinction , as concluded by @xcite and @xcite , with a@xmath6 values on the order of 0.1 .",
    "we thus do not correct for it in this source .",
    "the extinction in ngc 7023 and m17 was investigated by @xcite .",
    "these authors computed the extinction with the iterative spoon method @xcite using _ spitzer_/irs - sl data . regarding ngc 7023 , @xcite found significant extinction ( a@xmath7 ) in the lower left corner of the map , as also reported by @xcite .",
    "the small amount of extinction in the rest of the map , combined with the fact that the gradients of the extinction curve in the 11.0 - 11.6 and 12.3 - 13 m  regions are small , leads to a change in profile shapes of the 11.2 and 12.7 m  features at approximately the 4% level towards ngc 7023 .",
    "in contrast , the extinction towards m17 reaches a maximum a@xmath6 value of 1.48 in our field , with typical values near unity .",
    "therefore , we dereddened our spectra using the chiar & tielens ( 2006 ) extinction law . further discussion and analysis on this topic is presented in section  [ subsec:127_over_112 ] , including its effect on the 12.7/11.2 band strength ratio .",
    "a local spline continuum was chosen to isolate the pah emission features .",
    "a series of anchor points were chosen between 10 - 20 m  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ) to define the spline .",
    "this type of continuum determination has been performed several times in the literature and is chosen here for the purposes of comparison ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the pah band profiles and fluxes derived from the spline method are not very sensitive to the precise position of the anchor points , depending on the apparent smoothness of the underlying continuum ( i.e. spectra with , e.g. , undulating continua will lead to less precise pah band flux measurements ) .",
    "we estimate the influence of the continuum choice on our 11.2 and 12.7 m  band fluxes to be at the 5% level .",
    "we focus here specifically on the pah emission bands at 11.0 , 11.2 and 12.7 m. the former two bands we will generally refer to as the  11 m \" emission complex , and the latter as the 12.7 m  emission complex .",
    "the 12.0 m  pah band is excluded as it does not exhibit spectral blending with the 12.7 m  emission .",
    "the variability of the 11 m  and 12.7 m  emission complexes in ngc 7023 is examined in fig .  [ fig : raw ] . a representative set of pixels are chosen from the map such that each position is a different distance from the illuminating source .",
    "the relative strengths of the 11.0 and 11.2 m  emission bands show significant variations across the map ( upper panel ) . as stellar distance decreases , four effects are simultaneously visible : the 11.0 m  band strength relative to the 11.2 m  emission increases monotonically ; the peak position of the 11.2 m  band moves to shorter wavelengths ( from class ( a ) to class a(b ) ; see also @xcite ) ; a small , narrow feature at 11.20 m  appears ; and the red wing of the 11 m  complex either shifts towards shorter wavelengths or decreases in intensity ( also reported by @xcite for orion and ngc 7023 , respectively ) .    for these same positions",
    ", we inspect the behaviour of the 12.7 m  complex ( fig .  [",
    "fig : raw ] , lower panel ) . as the stellar distance decreases ,",
    "there is a clear transition of the 12.7 m  peak position towards shorter wavelengths  from approximately 12.77 to 12.71 m. the red wing also decreases in intensity ( or shifts to shorter wavelengths ) during this transition .",
    "in addition , there is a difference in the blue wing of the 12.7 m  complex between the map positions : in the range 12.5 - 12.7 m , positions closer to the star display greater emission intensities than those further away . it does not appear that the entire emission complex is shifting , as the offsets of the red wing , peak position and blue wing are not consistent .",
    "likewise , the emission blueward of 12.5 m  are identical in each position .",
    "the other sources exhibit only minor variations .",
    "m17 displays a similar peak transition in the 11.2 m  band , while ngc 2023 north and south show little peak variation in the 11 m  complex . at 12.7 m , ngc 2023 south and m17",
    "have small variations in the peak profile and red wing , but not as clearly as for ngc 7023 .",
    "the north map of ngc 2023 has no discernible 12.7 m  variations .",
    "the observed sub - structure of the emission complexes in ngc 7023 suggests that subtle and possibly important clues about pah sub - populations may be accessible .",
    "we now discuss traditional methods and a newly proposed method for analyzing the 11 and 12.7 m  pah bands .",
    "the 11 m  emission complex consists of two components : a strong , broad feature near 11.2 m  and a weaker band near 11.0 m. they are generally blended together near 11.1 m. there are multiple ways in which to measure the fluxes in these two emission bands .",
    "the simplest method is to integrate the 11 m  complex shortward of 11.1 m  ( representing the 11.0 m  band ) and longward of 11.1 m  ( representing the 11.2 m  band ) .",
    "a more complex method involves using gaussian components to help disentangle the spectral blend ( see , e.g. , @xcite , peeters et al .",
    "2015 , apj , submitted ) . in this case , one simultaneously fits a gaussian to the 11.0 m  band and a gaussian to the blue wing of the 11.2 m  complex .",
    "the 11.0 m  flux is then the flux contained within the fitted gaussian at 11.0 m. the 11.2 m  band flux is measured by subtracting the 11.0 m  gaussian from the original spectrum and integrating the remainder",
    ". a good single gaussian fit to the 11.2 m  band is not possible due to the asymmetric red wing ( @xcite ) . a third method to separate the 11.0 and 11.2 m  emission",
    "was introduced by @xcite .",
    "the authors used a five - component gaussian decomposition in which one component was responsible for the 11.0 m  emission .",
    "the sum of the remaining components then represented the 11.2 m  emission .",
    "a fourth possibility is to fit the 11 m  emission with two drude profiles , an approach used by the pahfit tool @xcite .",
    "for the 12.7 m  band , one measurement method ( besides direct integration ) was presented by @xcite .",
    "their approach uses the average 12.7 m  emission profile from @xcite as a template .",
    "this template is scaled to the data in the range 12.4 - 12.7 m , where only pah emission is expected .",
    "there is frequently an adjacent [ ne  ii ] 12.81 m  atomic line and h@xmath8 emission at 12.3 m , which prevents scaling beyond this spectral window . after fitting the pah template and subtracting its profile ,",
    "only atomic and/or molecular emission lines remain .",
    "these are fit with gaussian functions in accordance with the instrumental spectral resolution of the data .",
    "afterwards , the atomic and molecular lines are subtracted from the original 12.7 m  emission complex , leaving only the 12.7 m  pah emission . as with the 11 m  emission ,",
    "another possible 12.7 m  decomposition is to fit the band with two drude profiles ( the pahfit approach ) .    to account for the diversity of the profile variations ( see section  [ sec : specprof ] ) , we have introduced a new decomposition method which we will explore in detail .",
    "we attempted to fit the 11 and 12.7 m  complexes with a variety of gaussians and lorentzians .",
    "we used the non - linear least squares fitting tool mpfit @xcite , which is an implementation of the levenberg - marquardt algorithm @xcite .",
    "we compute the reduced-@xmath9 of the fit for each pixel in our spectral cubes .",
    "a histogram of all pixels in each cube is prepared , which is used to evaluate the overall fit .",
    "the best reduced-@xmath9 values resulted from fitting the 11 m  complex with five gaussians and the 12.7 m  complex with four . to determine their nominal parameters we applied an iteration method .",
    "initially , the components were permitted to move , as long as they did not overlap .",
    "their widths were also allowed to vary . after allowing several ",
    "free runs \" we observed that some of the parameters were converging on particular values ( those areas of the spectrum with less complex structure ) .",
    "we fixed these converging parameters and recomputed our fits .",
    "the process was iterated in this manner until all parameters had converged .",
    "the final fits are thus obtained with fixed peak positions and full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) values while only the peak intensity of each component was allowed to vary .",
    "it is important to emphasize that _ the decompositions we adopt are arbitrary_. we do not suggest that they reflect a  true decomposition \" or any a priori knowledge . rather , this method is applied to understand what ( if anything ) may be learned about the pah bands through simple fitting .",
    "[ [ the-11-mcomplex ] ] the 11 m  complex + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the best fits resulted from a five - component gaussian fit .",
    "the gaussians were fixed to the following positions : 11.021 m  ( fwhm : 0.066 m ) , 11.000 m  ( 0.021 m ) , 11.199 m  ( 0.021",
    "m ) , 11.320 m  ( 0.118 m ) and 11.245 m",

    "an example of the decomposition we adopted is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:112_3pos ] .",
    "we see that the 11.0 m  emission is determined by two components , and the 11.2 m  emission by three components .",
    "the two components of the 11.0 m  emission can be qualitatively interpreted as an underlying broad component ( centered near 11.0 m ) and a narrower symmetric feature placed upon it .",
    "the 11.2 m  profile displays a strong gaussian feature centered near 11.25 m  with an accompanying red wing ( out to 11.6 m ) .",
    "the slight asymmetry of the 11.2 m  peak , namely on the short - wavelength edge ( near 11.20 m ) , is coincident with the fifth component .",

    "one component of the fit is linked to the broad blue wing , upon which a weaker , narrower component is placed .",

    "the 11.2 m  emission profile varies across the three map positions . near the star , the 11.2 m  peak is asymmetric and centered near 11.20 m. far from the star , we see that the peak of the 11.2 m  emission has shifted to @xmath111.25 m  and it is now more symmetric .",

    "the 11-g3 component decreases in intensity with distance , similar to that of the 11-g1 emission .",

    ", @xcite showed that _",
    "neutral _ acenes produce emission near 11.0 m. at present it is not clear how significant their contribution will be to the astronomical 11.0 m  emission band , as they constitute a small set of the pah family .",
    "the nasa ames pah ir spectroscopic database @xcite , hereafter referred to as pahdb , has few included acenes at this time . using pahdb , @xcite showed that _",
    "nitrogen - substituted pahs , or panhs , were required to fit the 11.0 m  astronomical emission in ngc 7023 .",
    "another possibility is that [ sipah]@xmath23 complexes may contribute to the 11.0 m  band , as shown by quantum chemical calculations by @xcite .",
    "the resulting ir emission intensities of such complexes are expected to be similar to those of pure pah cations . to confirm this assignment further laboratory and theoretical work",
    "are required @xcite .",
    "regarding the 11.2 m  emission , it has been proposed that its red wing ( out to 11.4 - 11.6 m ) is due to the emission from very small grains ( vsgs ; @xcite ) .",
    "if vsg abundances are sufficiently high , they may influence the peak position of the 11.2 m  complex .",
    "apart from neutral acenes , all assignments of the 11.0 m  band point towards a cationic carrier .",
    "similarly , apart from vsgs , all assignments of the 11.2 m  band point towards neutral pahs .",
    "we adopt such charge assignments , leading to the following conclusions :    1 .   the 11 m  complex : 1 .   11-g1  dominated by cations 2 .   11-g2",
    " mixed charge 3 .",
    "11-g3  mixed charge 4 .",

    "12-g2  mixed charge 3 .",
    "12-g3  dominated by cations 4 .",
    "12-g4  dominated by neutrals          the mixed behaviour of the 11-g2 component indicates that the traditional 11.0 m  band is not purely cationic .",
    "the 11-g1 component however dominates the 11.0 m  flux , meaning that the emission is still primarily cationic .",
    "we estimate the contributions of these two components to the traditional 11.0 m  emission in fig .",
    "[ fig : stats ] .",
    "the 11-g1 component in general carries 60 - 80% of the flux : @xmath24% ( ngc 7023 ) , @xmath25% ( ngc 2023 south ) , @xmath26% ( ngc 2023 north ) and @xmath27% ( m17 ) . the 11-g2 component generally is the complement to these values : @xmath28% ( ngc 7023 ) , @xmath29% ( ngc 2023 south ) , @xmath30% ( ngc 2023 north ) and @xmath31% ( m17 ) . in some instances there is a minor contribution ( less than 5% ) from either the 11-g3 or 11-g4 component .",
    "we use the structural similarity indices ( table  [ tables : ssim7023 ] ) to quantify the mixed behaviour of the 11-g2 component . to do so",
    ", we must make the assumption here that the traditional 11.2 m  component traces neutral pahs and the 11-g1 component traces pure cations .",
    "we can reach the same conclusions if we instead use the traditional 11.0 m  band as a tracer of pure cations , though with greater uncertainty ( since the 11-g2 component is a minor contributor to the 11.0 m  emission ) .",
    "the similarity indices show that in ngc 7023 , the 11-g2 component is equally similar to the 11.2 m  emission ( ssim = 0.73 ) as it is to the 11-g1 emission ( ssim = 0.74 ) . in ngc 2023 south and north , however , the 11-g2 component is more similar to the 11.2 m  band than the 11-g1 emission ( ssim = 0.86 versus 0.60 in the southern map and ssim = 0.89 versus 0.75 in the northern map ) .",
    "this implies that at minimum 50% of the flux of the 11-g2 component is from neutral pahs . in turn",
    ", this then implies that _ the traditional 11.0 m  band is roughly @xmath32% neutral and @xmath33% cationic , with uncertainties approaching ten percentage points . _",
    "recently , @xcite reported that the solo ch@xmath0  mode of neutral acenes falls near 11.03 m  and argues for a possible contribution from neutral acenes to the 11.0 m  band .",
    "the results reported here , that there is a small neutral contribution to the 11.0 m  band in our sample , provide the first observational evidence in support of a partial origin in a neutral carrier .    @xcite applied blind signal separation to ngc 7023 and identified three basis vectors : pah@xmath34 , pah@xmath23 and vsgs .",
    "one interesting result of their analysis is that the pah@xmath34 signal , which is associated with neutral pahs , showed a local emission peak at 11.0 m. the authors suggest this is an artifact of the applied method , and may be compensated for by a local minimum in their vsg signal .",
    "however , since we have identified a component of the traditional 11.0 m  band that is linked to neutral pahs , we suggest that it may be due to the non - cationic component that we have found .    in the traditional assignment of the 11.0 and 11.2 m  bands ,",
    "i.e. originating from solo ch@xmath0  modes in cations and neutrals , respectively , the 11.0/11.2 ratio traces the pah charge fraction @xcite . to examine this",
    ", one must determine the intrinsic 11.0/11.2 flux ratio of a pah after a single photon excitation event .",
    "the authors chose circumcoronene as being representative of a typical pah , which then relates the observed 11.0/11.2 flux ratio to an implied neutral - to - cation fraction .",
    "the neutral fraction was shown to decrease in orion from 80% to 65% when moving away from the star , before returning to 80% at further distances .",
    "the unexpected diminution of the neutral fraction with increasing distance may reflect dehydrogenation , which would affect the measured 11.0/11.2 m  ratio , or it may indicate that circumcoronene is not a reasonable proxy for the total pah population @xcite .",
    "our results show that neutral pahs contribute to the 11.0 m  band , at approximately the 8 - 16% level .",
    "this may be an additional contributing factor to the unusual 11.0/11.2 behaviour observed by @xcite .",
    "mean spectra of species in pahdb were presented by @xcite , binned by size and charge state ( their fig .",
    "there does not appear to be neutral emission at 11.0 m. this may reflect biases or limitations of the database ( see @xcite ) . the neutral emission we deduce to exist at 11.0 m  is a small fraction of the cationic emission at 11.0 m , and thus it may be hidden ( if present in the pahdb spectra ) by averaging over all species .",
    "the 11.2 m  band displays two asymmetries : a prominent red wing in the range 11.4 - 11.6 m  and a narrow peak near 11.20 m  that appears only when sufficiently close to the illuminating source ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : raw ] ) .",
    "we exclude the 11.0 m  band from consideration here as it is understood to be a separate band .    in our decomposition ,",
    "the 11-g3 , 11-g4 and 11-g5 components all emit significantly at 11.20 m  ( fig .",
    "[ fig:112_3pos ] ) .",
    "however , the 11-g3 component is much narrower than the others and it is located at exactly 11.20 m , meaning that it might provide some clues about the origin of the peak asymmetry . with the caveats in mind , the results show that the spatial distribution of the 11-g3 component is a mixture of the traditional 11.0 and 11.2 m  emission .",
    "the 11-g3 component has almost no spectroscopic overlap with the traditional 11.0 m  emission , and the 11-g3 component is strongly blended at 11.2 m  with the neutral - carrying 11-g4 and 11-g5 bands , which dominate the 11.2 m  flux .",
    "this implies that _ we identify a cationic contribution to the 11.2 m  emission .",
    "_    furthermore , the strength of the 11-g1 and 11-g3 components both increase when approaching the star ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:112_3pos ] ) .",
    "this is complemented by a transition of the 11.2 m  peak position from class a(b ) ( near 11.24 m ) to class a ( near 11.20 m ) as reported by @xcite ( see @xcite for classification details ) .",
    "since the 11-g3 component is coincident with the nominal class a position , it suggests that it is the relative intensity of the 11-g3 component to that of 11.2 m  emission peak that determines the pah class . knowing also that the 11-g3 component has a cationic contribution , this implies that the pah classification of the 11.2 m  band is partially moderated by the relative fraction of emission from pah cations to neutrals .",
    "this effect is likely in addition to that reported by @xcite , who studied neutral pahs and identified that the class variations , from a to a(b ) , result from changes in the distribution of pah masses .    during the class transition from a(b ) to a",
    ", the flux in the red wing decreases significantly in ngc 7023 ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : raw ] ) , and less so in ngc 2023 south .",
    "the spectral asymmetry due to the variable red wing is well known in the literature @xcite .",
    "many pah bands display a red wing due to anharmonicity , but the magnitude of variations seen in the observations can not be reconciled with the expected degree of asymmetry from this effect @xcite .",
    "possible explanations have been presented in the literature but its origin has not yet been established .",
    "suggestions include emission from vsgs @xcite , pah clusters @xcite , pah anions @xcite , low - mass pahs @xcite and superhydrogenated pahs @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a spatial separation between neutral pahs and very small grains in ngc 7023 based on blind signal separation . in our decomposition , the flux of the red wing is carried by the 11-g4 component , while the  symmetric \" 11.2 m  emission is carried primarily by the 11-g5 component .",
    "as introduced in section  [ sec : results_maps ] , the spectral maps of the 11-g4 and 11-g5 components are similar but have subtle differences .",
    "we observe in ngc 7023 and 2023 south that the 11-g4 ( red wing ) emission is less extended than the 11-g5 emission , despite peaking in the same map position .",
    "the discrepancy with the results of @xcite is likely a consequence of the large width of our 11-g4 component , which has significant contributions at 11.1 m  and greater .",
    "we conclude that the entire 11 m  complex traces the following ( not necessarily unique ) populations : at 11.0 m , pah cations and a small fraction of neutrals ; and at 11.2 m , pah neutrals and a small fraction of pah cations . with our decomposition",
    "we are unable to deduce the carrier of the red wing .",
    "the 12.7 m  band is quite asymmetric , exhibiting a blue - shaded wing @xcite .",
    "our decomposition accounts for the blue wing primarily through the flux of the 12-g1 component , which is broad and centered at 12.55 m. in ngc 7023 , the 12-g1 component is very extended , easily encompassing the regions containing strong 11.0 and 11.2 m  emission .",
    "this suggests that the broad component , as defined here , has no charge preference . in ngc 2023 south ,",
    "it is also quite extended , though to a lesser extent than in ngc 7023 .",

    "the 12-g1 component is slightly more similar to the 11.2 m  emission than the 11.0 m  emission in ngc 2023 south .",
    "similar results to ngc 2023 south are found in the northern map , suggesting only a weak dependence on charge .",
    "this likely originates in the broadness of the component and reflects that the proposed decomposition does not completely disentangle all pah sub - populations .    @xcite used density functional theory ( dft ) to compute the absorption spectra of large symmetric pahs and large irregular pahs .",
    "near 12.7 m , these authors found that the mean emission from pah cations is blueshifted from the neutral position . in our decomposition , we find the same relationship : the 12-g3 component at 12.72 m  is cationic , while the 12-g4 component at 12.78 m  is neutral .",
    "hence , the intrinsic spectra and observations are consistent with each other .",
    "@xcite decomposed the pah emission in ngc 7023 with pahdb . in fitting the 12.7 m  emission",
    "the authors find that , in the dense region , neutrals are responsible for the majority of the total intensity . in the diffuse region(s ) , the cations instead carry most of the intensity .",
    "we observe that the ratio of the cationic 12-g3 emission to the neutral 12-g4 emission is higher in the diffuse region than the dense region , consistent with their result .",
    "@xcite also found that the dense region was characterized by small pahs ( those with fewer than 50 carbon atoms ) and the diffuse region was dominated by large pahs ( those with more than 50 carbon atoms ) . within this framework",
    ", the 12-g3 component then originates in large pahs preferentially .",
    "the 12-g4 component corresponds to emission that was comparable between small and large pahs in the pahdb fit @xcite , suggesting an equal mixture of sizes .",
    "it has been noted in the literature that some pah correlation plots involving the 12.7 m  band display a bifurcation @xcite .",
    "as our results show that the profile of the 12.7 m  band can be strongly dependent on ionization , perhaps the bifurcated correlations simply trace the two different charge states of the 12.7 m  emission .",
    "the 12.7/11.2 ratio has long been understood as probing hydrogen adjacency , as the 11.2 m  band is associated with solo ch@xmath0  bending modes and the 12.7 m  band with duo and trio ch@xmath0  bending modes @xcite .",
    "the astronomical range of 12.7/11.2 intensity ratios has been shown to be consistent with computed spectra of irregular pahs , which have solos , duos , trios and quartets @xcite .",
    "pahs with only solos and duos , such as those from the coronene family , lead to 12.7/11.2 ratios that lie at the low end of the astronomical range @xcite .",
    "in addition , this ratio can be further enhanced due to the coupling between the ch@xmath0  modes and the c - c ring deformation mode in ( elongated ) armchair pahs contributing to the 12.7 m  emission @xcite .    through the use of pahdb",
    ", @xcite showed that the spatial variation of the 12.7/11.2 ratio in ngc 7023 seems to primarily trace ionization rather than edge structure . based on",
    "their database fits , the authors observed that the ionization fraction increases by 200% across ngc 7023 , whereas the hydrogen adjacency only drops by 25% .",
    "since we have presented a way of generally disentangling ions from neutrals in the 11 and 12.7 m  complexes , we can probe the dependence of the 11.2/12.7 ratio on charge and molecular edge structure .. for the mixed charge bands ( e.g. 11-g2 , 11-g3 ) , we use the spatial maps and structural similarity indices to discern if one charge state appears to be dominant . the 11-g2 and 12-g2 components",
    "are found to be on average equally similar to the cationic- and neutral - dominated bands .",
    "thus , we assume half of their flux contributes to the total cationic emission , and half to the neutral emission . for the other mixed charge bands ( 11-g3 , 12-g1 ) , we tested a series of different charge fractions ( 25% , 50% , or 75% cationic ) .",
    "the fluxes of these components relative to the other fluxes in the calculation are sufficiently low that they do not affect our conclusions .",
    "since the 11 m  emission is thought to trace solo ch@xmath0  structures , and the 12.7 m  emission duo and trio ch@xmath0  structures , we finally measure the solo / duo+trio ratio for cations , and separately for neutrals .",

    "although the uncertainty is large , the derived ionization fraction is very similar to the 200% increase ( i.e. a factor of 3 ) determined by @xcite . to study hydrogen adjacency , we measured the 12.7/11.2 ratio separately for cations and neutrals . for cations ,",
    "hydrogen adjacency varies across the map by approximately 30% , while for neutrals it varies by about 10% .",
    "these results are generally consistent with the 25% value presented by @xcite .",

    "the hydrogen adjacency varied by approximately 25% for cations , but only 7 or 8% for neutrals .",
    "this analysis shows that the 12.7/11.2 ratio depends largely on the ionization fraction and to a lesser extent on molecular edge structure .",

    "the spatial morphology of the 12.7/11.2 emission was compared against the spatial distribution of the 6.2/(@xmath36 m ) fraction and the pahdb - derived fractional emission in pah cations @xcite .",

    "this originates in the fact that , to first order , the neutral dependence is removed .",
    "the 12-g4/11.2 ratio shows little emission in the diffuse region and relatively little variation across the region of peak 11.2 m  emission .",
    "one maximum is observed in the dense region .",
    "clearly the 12-g3/11.2 and 12-g4/11.2 ratios are tracing different pah populations . taking these effects into account ,",
    "it is apparent that the 12.7/11.2 ratio probes both ionization and molecule structure , which both depend on the local physical conditions ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "it s worth noting that the 12.7/11.2 ratio can be greatly affected by extinction . to illustrate this",
    ", we quantify this effect by comparing the 12.7/11.2 ratio before and after correcting for extinction in m17 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : extinction ] ) and two  regions from @xcite . using the interstellar extinction curves of @xcite , we corrected for extinction . in m17 , the 12.7/11.2 ratio decreases from a range of 0.37 - 0.72 ( before correction ) to 0.35 - 0.52 ( after correction ) .",
    "some pixels exhibit a greater than 30% decrease in the 12.7/11.2 ratio .",
    "we also examined two  regions from the sample of @xcite , using the extinction measurements of @xcite : iras 15384 - 5348 ( a@xmath37 ) and iras 18317 - 0757 ( a@xmath38 ) .",
    "the latter source exhibits the largest 12.7/11.2 ratio in the study of @xcite before extinction correction ( 1.49 ) , but this value is near unity after correction ( 1.03 ) .",
    "extinction correction thus significantly reduces the large range in 12.7/11.2 ratios observed in  regions .        with regards to the 12.7/11.2 ratio in ngc 7023 , only three pixels in the map meeting the signal - to - noise criterion",
    "are affected by extinction to any substantial degree ( approximately 10 - 15% flux difference in the 12.7 m  band ) .",
    "these pixels are on the lower edge of the map and do not affect the map or our conclusions .",
    "we have examined the spatial and spectral behavior of the 11 and 12.7 m  pah emission complexes in high - resolution _ spitzer_/irs maps of ngc 7023 , ngc 2023 south and north and m17 .",
    "we have introduced a five - component gaussian decomposition of the 11 m  emission and a four - component decomposition of the 12.7 m  emission . at 11 m ,",
    "two components are centered near 11.0 m , one of which is relatively broad and the other relatively narrow . a narrow ,",
    "weak gaussian component is located near the peak of the 11.2 m  complex , slightly offset towards the blue .",
    "a strong band carries most of the peak 11.2 m  emission , and a final broad emission component is responsible for the red wing of the 11.2 m  band .",
    "the 12.7 m  decomposition consists of one broad feature on the blue wing , two components near 12.75 m , and a narrow feature that appears on the blue wing in some positions .",
    "we investigated the spatial distributions of these components in our spectral maps and quantified their similarities the structural similarity index , in addition to flux correlation plots .",
    "we have arrived at the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "the traditional 11.0 m  emission band has a contribution from neutral pahs .",
    "we identify a broad cationic feature at 11.00 m  and a weaker , narrower mixed - charge state band at 11.00 m. in total , 78 - 88% of the traditional 11.0 m  flux is carried by cations , and 8 - 16% of the flux is carried by neutral pahs .",
    "this may be supporting evidence for the contribution of neutral acenes to the 11.0 m  band @xcite .",
    "the traditional broad 11.2 m  emission band has a small cationic contribution at 11.20 m. the relative strength of this cationic feature to the broad 11.2 m  emission determines the overall peak position of the 11.2 m  complex .",
    "this implies that the pah classification of the 11.2 m  emission is partially determined by the fraction of pah cations to neutrals , in addition to the varying distribution of pah masses reported by @xcite .",
    "the variable peak position of the 12.7 m  complex can be explained by the relative strengths of two competing gaussian components at 12.72 and 12.78 m. the features are spectroscopically blended , yet they distinctly trace cations and neutrals , respectively , in the spectral maps . 4 .",
    "the component responsible for the bulk of the blue - shaded wing of the 12.7 m  band appears to be only weakly dependent on charge .",
    "this may indicate that the proposed decomposition does not completely disentangle all pah sub - populations .",
    "the observed contribution of both cation and neutral pahs to the 12.7 m  band supports the use of the 12.7/11.2 intensity ratio as a charge proxy @xcite .",
    "however , after accounting for pah charge , structural variations are still probed by the 12.7/11.2 ratio .",
    "these results illustrate the power of spectral maps for understanding the complicated spectral profiles of pahs , wherein blended spectral components can be understood as independent spatial components . the next step is to apply this technique to other high - resolution spectral maps as well as integrated spectra of individual objects .",
    "this will help improve the quantification of the non - cationic emission at 11.0 m  and understand the behaviour of the broad blue 12.7 m  wing , which appears to be insensitive to charge based on the applied decomposition .",
    "this work and the interpretation of the pah emission bands will strongly benefit from the heightened spectral resolution and sensitivity of the forthcoming james webb space telescope mission .",

    "these are discussed in the main text in sections  [ sec:11decomp ] and  [ sec:12decomp ] . here",
    "we give a brief summary .",
    "in general , ngc 2023 north displays a much more complex morphology than ngc 2023 south or ngc 7023 .",
    "the peak pah emission appears to be oriented either vertically in this map ( e.g. 11.0 m , 11-g1 emission ) or horizontally ( e.g. 11.2 m , 11-g3 , 11-g4 , 11-g5 , 12-g4 emission ) , with significant overlap .",
    "however , the similarities between bands found in ngc 2023 north are generally consistent with those found for ngc 2023 south and ngc 7023 ( see main text ) . likewise , m17 is a complicated environment for analysis . in fig .",
    "[ fig : map_m17 ] , we observe that the peak 11.0 and 11.2 m  emission regions are nearly coincident .",
    "however , the key distinguishing feature seems to be the m17  spur \" emission in the upper right corner of the map , which is stronger in the 11.2 m  band .",
    "based only on this distinguishing feature , key results from studying ngc 7023 and ngc 2023 south are also present here .",
    "the most robust trends  that the 11.0 m  and 12-g3 emission are well - matched , as are the 11.2 m  and 12-g4 emission  are both observed in m17 when examining the spur , despite its complexity .",
    "we examine ratios of band fluxes to probe for the presence of correlations between emission features ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] ) .",
    "we compare first the 12-g3 and 12-g4 band fluxes to that of the 11.0 m  emission ( all normalized to the 11.2 m  band ) .",
    "we also plot the 12-g3 and 12-g4 band fluxes against that of the 11.2 m  band ( then normalized to the 11.0 m  emission ) . we identify a strong correlation between the 12-g4 and 11.2 m  bands in ngc 7023 and ngc 2023 south and a mild correlation in ngc 2023 north ( with associated weighted pearson correlation coefficients of 0.98 , 0.97 and 0.58 , respectively ) .",
    "another strong correlation is identified between the 12-g3 and 11.0 m  bands in these same sources , with coefficients 0.96 , 0.89 and 0.87 , respectively .",
    "the  cross terms \" of these correlations , i.e. the 12-g3 band versus the 11.0 m  band , and the 12-g3 versus the 11.2 m  emission , reveal some residual structure and/or mild correlations .",
    "there is clearly some  cross - contamination \" , but the strongest relationships are nevertheless between the 12-g3 and 11.0 m  bands , and between the 12-g4 and the 11.2 m  bands .",
    "similar correlation plots for the 12-g1 and 12-g2 components are presented in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] . in general , both the 12-g1 and 12-g2 components correlate with the 11.0 and 11.2 m  bands , implying a mixed charge origin .",
    "m17 is an unusual case , as the only distinction between the traditional 11.0 and 11.2 m  emission in the spectral maps was the m17 spur .",
    "the correlation plots involving m17 are also outlying cases , as the 11.0/11.2 ratio is constant ."
