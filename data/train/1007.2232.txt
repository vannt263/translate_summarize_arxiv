    "@xmath12 of @xmath0 to @xmath3 is defined as the minimum of @xmath11 , @xmath7 .",
    "the volume distance is an important object in computer vision which has been extensively studied in the planar case @xmath13 ( @xcite ) and was also considered in the case @xmath14 ( @xcite ) . for @xmath13 , the hessian of the volume distance was studied in ( @xcite,@xcite ) , where it is shown that its determinant equals @xmath15 .",
    "this property is not extended to higher dimensions .",
    "nevertheless , we prove in this paper some asymptotic properties of the hessian of the volume distance in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "a pair @xmath16 is called _ minimizing _ when @xmath10 is the minimum of @xmath11 with @xmath0 fixed .",
    "a minimizing pair necessarily satisfies @xmath17 it is proved in @xcite that if @xmath16 satisfies , then @xmath0 is the centroid of @xmath18 .    in order to obtain @xmath19 implicitly defined by , the second derivative of @xmath20 with respect to @xmath10 must be non - degenerate . a formula for this second derivative",

    "one concludes that the second derivative is positive definite in a half - neighborhood of @xmath3 , i.e. , the part of a neighborhood of @xmath3 contained in its convex side .",
    "based on this , we verify that there exists a half - neighborhood @xmath21 of @xmath3 such that , for any @xmath22 , there exists a unique @xmath23 that minimizes the map @xmath24 .",
