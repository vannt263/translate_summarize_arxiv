    "recent determinations suggest values of about @xmath72 gyr for the age of globular clusters ( t=@xmath73  gyr , @xcite ; t=@xmath74  gyr @xcite ; t=@xmath75  gyr , @xcite ) .",
    "these values are in conflict with the age of the universe derived from the most recent estimates of the hubble constant and the standard cosmological eistein - de sitter model . since , most recent determinations of @xmath76 are in the range of @xmath77 km s@xmath78mpc@xmath78 ( @xmath79 km / s / mpc , @xcite ; @xmath80 km / s / mpc , @xcite ; @xmath81 km / s / mpc , @xcite , @xmath82 km / s / mpc , @xcite ) , the age of the universe is constrained to be @xmath83  gyr in an einstein - de sitter model , and @xmath84  gyr in a flat universe with @xmath85 .",
    "current ages for globular clusters result then uncomfortably large in the framework of standard cosmological models .    the most robust indicator of the age of globular clusters is the absolute visual magnitude of the main sequence turn - off , @xmath86 . by comparing @xmath86 with theoretical isochrones of appropriate metallicity and helium abundance one",
    "gets the age of the cluster ( see eq . 3 by @xcite ) .",
    "since the directly observable quantity is the apparent magnitude of the turn - off , @xmath87 , it is necessary to know the distance of the cluster .",
    "indeed , the main difficulty in the derivation of the ages of globular clusters is the large uncertainty in the distance scale ( @xcite ) .",
    "independent of the method used , the present `` actual '' accuracy in gc distance modulus determinations is of the order of 0.2 mag which , in turn , corresponds to an uncertainty of about 3 gyr in the age .",
    "the simplest technique to derive distances to clusters is to compare their main sequence ( ms ) with a suitable template ( @xcite ) : i.e.  an adequate sample of metal poor non - evolved subdwarfs with known distances .",
    "unfortunately , the template main sequence for metal - poor globular clusters has been up to now quite uncertain due to the paucity of metal poor subdwarfs for which reliable data are available , i.e.  absolute magnitudes and colours accurate to better than a few hundreds of a magnitude ( it should be reminded that an error @xmath88 = 0.07 mag in the magnitude of the turn - off and/or an error @xmath89 = 0.01 mag in its colour , both translate into an uncertainty of about 1 gyr in the derived age ) , _ and _ metallicity[fe / h ] known to @xmath90 dex .",
    "table 2 of @xcite very clearly illustrates the contributions to the total error budget in the age estimate due to the various quantities entering the main sequence fitting technique .",
    "uncertainties in distance moduli are by far the most relevant contributors to the total error affecting the age .",
    "hipparcos has provided absolute parallaxes for over 118,000 stars , with typical accuracies of @xmath91 mas .",
    "we have parallaxes for 99 subdwarfs with metallicities in the range @xmath92 [ fe / h ] @xmath93 ; this sample was complemented with data for about 50 stars ( mostly metal - rich ) having good ground - based parallaxes and with objects from @xcite list .",
    "+ v magnitudes and colours ( johnson @xmath94  and @xmath95 , and strmgren @xmath96 , @xmath97  and @xmath98 ) for the programme stars were obtained from a careful average of the data available in the literature .",
    "we also used the @xmath99  magnitudes and @xmath94  colours provided by the tycho mission ( @xcite ) , after correcting them for the systematic difference with ground - based data ( 0.003  mag in @xmath94 ) .",
    "high dispersion spectra were acquired for about two thirds of the subdwarfs observed by hipparcos , using the 2.7 m telescope at mcdonald and the 1.8 m telescope at cima ekar ( asiago ) , and were used to derive accurate metal abundances .",
    "the abundance derivation followed the same precepts of the reanalysis of @xmath100  field and @xmath101  gc stars described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we found that o and the other @xmath102elements are overabundant in all metal - poor stars in our sample .",
    "the average overabundances in stars with [ fe / h]@xmath103 are : @xmath104}= 0.38\\pm 0.13\\ ] ] @xmath105}= 0.26\\pm 0.08,\\ ] ]    ( see poster by gratton et  al . at this same meeting for a more detailed description of the abundance analysis results ) .",
    "only _ bona fide _ single stars with @xmath106 and @xmath107 were used in our age derivation , these are listed in table 1 together with their relevant quantities .",
    "stars brighter than this limit were discarded since they may be evolved off the zero age main sequence ( zams ) , as well as we eliminated all detected or suspected binaries , except the objects were the separation among the two components is so wide to not disturb the derived absolute magnitudes @xmath108 and the colours .",
    "errors in the derived @xmath108 are @xmath109 mag .",
    "an accurate analysis via montecarlo simulations , of the lutz - kelker corrections most appropriate to our sample , revealed them to be very small ( @xmath110 ) and thus they were neglected . a not negligible source of systematic errors is , instead , the contamination of the sample of subdwarfs used in the ms fitting technique by unresolved binaries . a very careful procedure was applied to clean up the sample from binaries .",
    "further , a statistical approach was devised to evaluate systematic corrections of our distance moduli for the possible presence of residual undetected binaries .",
    "the field subdwarfs listed in table 1 were divided into metallicity bins and used to define template main sequences of the proper metallicity to be compared with the globular cluster main loci . to account for the difference between cluster and field star metallicity ,",
    "the colours of the subdwarfs were corrected for the corresponding shift of the main sequences .",
    "it should be noted that the hipparcos parallaxes are systematically smaller than those listed in the 1991 version of the yale trigonometric parallax catalogue ( @xcite ) , so that the derived absolute magnitudes are on average brighter .",
    "we anticipate that * everything else being constant , globular cluster ages derived exploiting this new distance scale are about 2.8  gyrs younger than those derived from ground - based parallaxes for the local subdwarfs*.      main sequence loci for the programme clusters were taken from literature data .",
    "we generally relied upon the quality of the original photometric data , although such a good quality is not always an obvious issue .",
    "column 6 of table 2 gives references for the adopted colour magnitude diagrams .",
    "+ cluster metal abundances have recently been obtained by @xcite , using high dispersion spectra of cluster giants and an abundance procedure totally consistent with that used for the subdwarf sample .",
    "the availability of high quality abundances ( standard errors @xmath111  dex ) for both field subdwarfs and gc giants on a consistent abundance scale is one of the basic ingredients of our study .",
    "+ interstellar reddenings for some of the considered clusters may be uncertain by as much as @xmath112  mag , implying errors as large as 5  gyr in the derived ages . reddening values for the programme clusters",
    "have been published by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these values were averaged with new reddening estimates based on strmgren photometry of nearby field stars , to derive the final adopted reddenings listed in column 4 of table  2 .",
    "once template main sequences for the appropriate metallicity are determined , and cluster reddenings and metallicities are known , cluster distance moduli are derived by least square fitting of the apparent magnitude of the cluster main sequence at a given colour and the absolute magnitude of the template main sequence at the same colour .",
    "figure  [ f : fig1 ] displays the fits of the individual gc main sequences with the nearby subdwarfs of the proper metallicity .",

    "the correct dependence of @xmath115  on [ fe / h ] is , however still rather uncertain .",

    "@xcite list @xmath115 values for all the clusters in our sample .",
    "a close inspection of their data revealed that these values correspond to a mean magnitude of the hb .",
    "they were transformed to @xmath142 s using the relation given by @xcite , and then combined with the metallicities listed in table  2 to derive the following relation between absolute magnitude of the hb and metallicity :    @xmath3}+1.5 ) + ( 0.48\\pm 0.04)\\ ] ]    in figure  2 we compare our new @xmath115  _ vs _ [ fe / h ] relation with the predictions of some recent horizontal branch models .",
    "the use of the above relationship has a direct impact on several astronomical issues .",
    "for instance , since our value of @xmath108  for field rr lyraes at [ fe / h]@xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) is 0.11 mag brighter than the value quoted by @xcite , we derive a distance modulus for the lmc of @xmath145  ( where the error is the statistical one at [ fe / h]@xmath143 ) . if this distance to the lmc is used ( rather than the one frequently adopted from cepheids : @xmath146 ) , the extragalactic distance scale increases ( and estimates of the hubble constant decrease ) by 5 per  cent ( for instance , the value of @xmath147  derived from sn  ia by @xcite , would change from @xmath148  to @xmath149 ) .",
    "we only remark that the distance modulus for the lmc based on the hipparcos calibrations is @xmath150  from cepheids ( @xcite ) , and @xmath151  from miras ( @xcite ) in excellent agreement with our determination .",
    "the most recent determination from the expanding ring around the sn 1987a is @xmath152  ( @xcite ) .",
    "ages for the programme clusters were derived from the absolute magnitude of the turn - off point , @xmath86 .",
    "we used the distance moduli of table  2 and the @xmath153apparent magnitudes , @xmath87 listed by @xcite .",
    "typical errors quoted for @xmath87  are @xmath154 leading to errors of @xmath155  mag , and to a corresponding average random uncertainty of 12 per  cent in ages .    columns 8 to 12 of table  2 list the ages we derived from different sets of isochrones .",
    "original values from different isochrones have been corrected to a common value @xmath156(@xcite ) for the solar absolute magnitude . in the isochrones labeled as mlt",
    ", convection has been modeled using the mixing length theory , while those labeled as cm use the @xcite theory . on any other respect ,",
    "these isochrone sets are quite similar to each other : they use updated equation of state ( including debye screening ) , opacities from the los alamos group , and colour transformations according to @xcite .",
    "our data seem to show that some scatter exists in the ages of oosterhoff ii clusters ( m92 , m68 and m30 ) , however this scatter is not significantly larger than the expected error bar . furthermore , the close similarity of the c - m diagrams for the metal - poor clusters strongly supports a common age for these clusters .",
    "we have therefore concluded that the oosterhoff ii clusters are indeed coeval , and that the scatter is due to observational errors .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached for the blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) clusters ( m13 , ngc288 , ngc6752 ) .",
    "our age estimates for the oosterhoff i clusters ( m5 and ngc362 ) are instead @xmath157  gyr lower than those for the bhb clusters which in turn are similar to those for the oosterhoff ii clusters .",
    "a rather low age is found also for 47  tuc .",
    "the reality of this age - difference is argument of hot debate .",
    "however we must stress that the absolute luminosity of the turn - off point is not the best procedure for the derivation of _ relative _ ages , ( @xcite ) .",
    "given the small numbers , the statistical error bars are not very significant .",
    "it seems then wiser to exclude the oosterhoff i clusters and 47  tuc from our estimate of the age of the oldest globular clusters in our sample .",
    "we thus identify the group of _ bona fide _ old clusters with the oosterhoff ii and the bhb clusters .",
    "average ages for our _ oldest _ globular clusters obtained with different isochrone sets are given in table  3 .",
    "although we can not exclude the possibility that some clusters are older than the average , this is not required by our observations .",
    "we will then assume that these average values are the best guess for the age of the oldest globular clusters .",
    "if we use isochrones based on the mlt - convection , the mean age for the six _ bona fide _ old clusters is @xmath158  gyr , where the first error bar is the standard deviation of the mean values obtained for different clusters , and the second error bar is the spread of ages derived from different isochrone sets .",
    "however , to better quantify the error bars , we used a montecarlo procedure to derive the distribution of total errors and to provide the statistical interval of confidence ( 95 per  cent range ) .",
    "the following sources of uncertainty were taken into account : internal errors , uncertainties in the solar @xmath108 , uncertainties due to the statistical correction for binaries , reddening scale , metal abundance scale , stellar model code , convection mechanism , he - sedimentation . in summary",

    "have presented at this meeting results on the age of m92 based on ms fitting and on a slightly different data base , reaching the conclusion that @xmath163 gyr . a few comments on their result",
    "is worth here .",
    "the difference in the age derived for m92 can not be ascribed to differences in the data base . indeed , if we eliminate from pont s et  al .",
    "data stars at @xmath164 , that may be evolved off the zams , and all the detected or suspected binaries , the two data samples differ by only one object .",
    "stars brighter than @xmath165 may lead to systematic errors in the derived distance moduli , as it is not clear whether gcs and metal - poor field stars are exactly co - eval .",
    "for example , a 4 gyr age difference between a calibrating subdwarf at @xmath166 and a gc would lead to a systematic error of 0.05 mag in the distance modulus .",
    "if binaries are to be included in the sample , they must be corrected to account for the contribution due to the secondary components . however , the correction is uncertain and strongly depends on the luminosity function assumed for the secondary components .",
    "we estimate an average binary correction of 0.17 mag ( based on the luminosity function of population i field stars , @xcite ) , and multiply it by the probability of each individual star to be a binary .",
    "pont et  al .",
    "use , instead , an average correction of 0.375 mag , based on the binary mass distribution in praesepe .",
    "this is a dynamically evolved open cluster , where binaries of higher mass ratio are likely to be evaporated and , conversely , equal mass binaries are likely concentrated in the center ( kroupa et  al . ) thus leading to an overestimate of their number and , in turn , of the derived correction .      indeed , the major sources of controversy are the corrections that must be applied to the data .",
    "they strongly depend on the selection criteria adopted to build up the sample .",
    "pont s et  al .",
    "data base is formed by two sub - samples , a first one ( about 60 per  cent of the stars ) selected before the hipparcos parallaxes were known , and a second one ( the remaining 40 per  cent ) selected _ a posteriori _ once parallaxes and colours were known .",
    "different corrections should thus be applied to the two different subsets .",
    "pont et  al .",
    "apply mean bias corrections of + 0.064 and @xmath1670.115 mag to the subdwarfs and the subgiants , respectively , used to fit the m92 locus . beside distorting the shape of the template sequence ,",
    "these large and uncertain corrections have a strong impact on the measure of the distance modulus . since we do not know in detail how their sample has actually been selected , nor if average or individual star corrections have been computed and applied , we can not assess the reliability of their derived distance modulus .",
    "finally , we caution that the use of just one cluster to infer the age of the _ oldest _ globular clusters may be very dangerous since it strongly relies upon the accuracy of that cluster photometry .",
    "for instance , there is a 0.04 mag difference between the colour of the m92 main sequence as presented by @xcite and that by @xcite : this would translate into a 3 to 4 gyr difference in the age derived for this important cluster .",
    "the use of a not too restricted sample of carefully selected clusters ( as we did ) reduces the effect of photometric errors and cmd peculiarities .      assuming a minimum delay of 0.5 gyrs from the birth of the universe before the formation of globular clusters our age estimate is compatible with an einstein - de sitter model if @xmath168 km s@xmath78mpc@xmath78 , and @xmath169 km s@xmath78mpc@xmath78 in a flat universe with @xmath85 . within the framework of inflationary models ( even in the restricted but more elegant solution of the einstein - de sitter universe ) ,",
    "the presently determined age for the globular clusters is then consistent with current estimates of the hubble constant , even without the @xmath170 per  cent reduction which is given by the adoption of the present distance scale , or that proposed by @xcite .",
    "we conclude that * at the present level of accuracy of globular cluster ages , there is no discrepancy with standard inflationary models for the universe*."
