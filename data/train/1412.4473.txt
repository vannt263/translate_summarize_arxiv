    "in recent years , tremendous progress has been made in the experimental study of semiconducting nanostructures .",
    "advanced epitaxial techniques allow systematic control of atomic - scale features in the fabrication along vertical dimension , while nanoscale lithography allows the patterning of structures with few - nanometer lateral dimensions@xcite .",
    "fine tuning of these characteristic length scales along lateral and vertical directions allow carrier confinement such that the corresponding energy levels are quantized .",
    "examples include ingan / gan quantum wells with three - dimensional electron confinement@xcite , carbon nanotubes , in which carriers are confined in two dimensions@xcite , and the inversion or accumulation layer of metal - oxide field effect transistors with quasi-2d carrier confinement@xcite .",
    "regardless of the confinement scheme , however , quantization is affected by a carrier potential that depends on the details of the particular nanostructure embodiment .",
    "it is desirable , therefore , to have methods for calculating the carrier potential that are applicable to a broad class of nanostructures .",
    "theoretically , such systems have been modeled using the coupled schrdinger - poisson ( sp ) equation that gives rise to a self - consistent solution for the carrier potential @xcite . a conventional approach to obtain this self - consistent solution is to solve the schrdinger and poisson equations iteratively using the finite - difference method .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finite - difference methods can often get slow and expensive due to the iterative nature of the calculations , which involves going back and forth between the schrdinger and poisson equations .",
    "therefore , it is useful to explore other ways of arriving at the carrier potential . in this paper",
    ", we approach the problem of solving the sp equation via a variational principle .",
    "variational formulations often shed new light on the underlying physics of the problem as they appeal to the universal physical principle that the true solution of the problem must minimize the free energy associated with the system . within a variational approach it is possible to bypass any iterative calculations and arrive directly at the carrier potential via the minimization of an appropriate functional . furthermore ,",
    "if the variational principle is based on a true free - energy functional , that is , a functional that minimizes to reveal the equilibrium free - energy of the system , the sp equation can be solved on - the - fly leading to enormous savings in computational costs .",
    "for example , using dynamical optimization procedures such as the car - parrinello molecular dynamics @xcite , it is possible to evaluate the evolving electronic potential profile in a double - gate device in conjunction with updating the gate voltage without explicitly re - solving the sp equation .    among the variational principles of sp theory that exist in the literature",
    ", none of the formulations are based on a free - energy functional @xcite .",
    "for example , the functional derived by nier does single out the correct potential upon minimization , but its minimum value is negative of the free energy @xcite . in this article , we derive the needed free - energy functional of the potential for the sp theory .",
    "we construct a local and a non - local form for the free - energy functional . while the non - local functional",
    "is applicable to generic systems , the construction of the local form is contingent upon the availability of an inverse function specific to the system under consideration . on the other hand",
    ", we expect the local functional to offer more benefits from a computational viewpoint compared with its non - local counterpart . the derivation of the local functional employs the modified lagrange multiplier procedure for constructing constrained variational functionals recently introduced by us in ref .  .",

    "as mentioned above , some common examples include quantum dots ( @xmath1 ) , carbon nanotubes ( @xmath2 ) , and metal - insulator - metal arrangements where electrons are under quasi-2d confinement .",
    "an important quantity of interest is the carrier potential profile for a given set of external conditions .",
    "if the density of electrons is a known function of position then , to a good approximation , the carrier potential can be computed from the poisson equation . in general , however , the electronic charge density is not known , thus making the potential profile inaccessible .",
    "the schrdinger - poisson ( sp ) theory suggests a way to proceed in this situation .",
    "microscopically , sp theory is equivalent to a self - consistent hartree theory where the many - body effects of electronic interactions are approximated by a mean field given by the solution to the poisson equation . in other words , within the sp formulation of the problem ,",
    "the potential term entering an effective one - electron schrdinger equation is taken to be the same potential that solves the poisson equation whose source term is the local electron density .",
    "note that the electron density is a function of fermi - dirac operator , which in turn depends on the hamiltonian ( and hence the original potential ) entering the schrdinger equation .",
    "therein lies the self - consistent nature of the sp formulation reflected in a set of coupled schrdinger and poisson equations .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the effective one - electron system is given by @xmath3\\psi_k(\\textbf{r } ) = \\lambda_k\\psi_k(\\textbf{r}),\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is planck s constant divided by @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the mass of the electron , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are , respectively , the energy eigenfunctions and eigenvalues .",
    "the function @xmath9 is the electrostatic contribution to the potential energy with @xmath10 being the effective electrostatic potential field which the electron experiences and @xmath11 is the electronic charge .",
    "the external potential @xmath12 is the electronic confinement potential that leads to space quantization and in the rest of the paper will be considered as a known function of @xmath13 .",
    "the key assumption in sp theory is that @xmath10 satisfies the poisson equation : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the permittivity and @xmath16 is the electron density which is given by the equation : [ eq : density1 ] n(*r * ) = g_k |_k(*r*)|^2 f_k . in eq .  , @xmath17 is the fermi - dirac function that provides the occupation number of the @xmath18 state with @xmath19 being the chemical potential and @xmath20 is the inverse thermal energy .",

    "for example , in the case of electron spin , @xmath21 assumes the value 2 .",
    "clearly , equations and are coupled and their solution exhibits a self - consistent character .",
    "the self - consistent calculation typically proceeds in the following way .",
    "one begins with a choice of @xmath22 and solves eq .   to obtain @xmath8 and @xmath7 . using these results ,",
    "@xmath23 is evaluated from eq .  .",
    "this density is employed in eq .   and",
    "the latter is solved for the potential @xmath22 .",
    "if the newly computed @xmath22 is the same as the original starting potential choice ( or within some pre - defined small error ) , the calculation stops , otherwise , the loop continues with the new @xmath22 as the potential choice for eq .  .",
    "while the above procedure of obtaining the potential is common in the literature , we would like to emphasize that , within the framework of the sp approximation , we are not required to solve the schrdinger equation . to see this",
    ", we recognize that the density @xmath23 is a thermodynamical quantity and is invariant under basis transformation . in other words , the evaluation of @xmath23 does not require the eigenbasis of the hamiltonian operator ; any orthonormal basis can be employed , although it is expected that the eigenbasis would offer the most ease in carrying out the computation .",
    "hence , solving the schrdinger equation is not necessary to evaluate @xmath23 and subsequently compute the electronic potential .",
    "this fact is useful to represent the aforementioned self - consistency of the sp theory in the form of a single equation which we show next .",
    "the invariance of the density @xmath23 under basis transformation is reflected by [ eq : density ] n(*r * ) = where @xmath24 is the fermi - dirac operator @xmath25 with @xmath26 being the hamiltonian . here",
    "@xmath27 is the kinetic energy operator . for the sake of brevity",
    ", we will often omit writing the operators using complete notation , for example , @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "we will employ the full notation or emphasize the meaning of the symbols when it becomes necessary to clarify the content .",
    "also , for clarity , we will suppress the explicit notation for the identity operator and instead use 1 to denote both the operator and the number and trust the reader to figure out the appropriate meaning from the context .",
    "we observe that the operator @xmath24 is a function of @xmath30 making @xmath23 , in general , a functional of @xmath22 .",
    "accordingly , we introduce the notation @xmath31 $ ] and define the charge density @xmath32 as @xmath33 = q n[v]$ ] .",

    "the function @xmath22 that satisfies the above equation is the equilibrium potential of the confined electron system .",
    "the electron density @xmath23 can be evaluated by substituting this potential in eq .   and the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the system are known by employing this potential in eq .  .",
    "we will now approach the sp formulation of the confined electron gas problem via a variational principle . within a variational approach",
    ", we find the potential that satisfies the sp equation by minimizing a judiciously constructed functional . in the first part of this section",
    ", we provide our functional , in both its local and non - local form , and discuss its behavior at the extremum .",
    "the second part shows the derivation of the functional . for the sake of brevity",

    "one can readily verify that while @xmath63 $ ] produces the correct potential upon extremization and evaluates to the correct free energy , it becomes a maximum at the extremum .",
    "the functional derived by nier is negative of @xmath63 $ ] and so while it does become a minimum at the extremum , its evaluation at the minimum point is not equal to the true free energy of the electronic system and hence it is not a free - energy functional .",

    "following a process similar to the one employed in arriving at the lda limit of our local sp functional , we obtain the local free - energy sp functional in the tf limit to be : @xmath123 & = &   a[v ]   + \\frac{1}{8\\pi}\\int \\epsilon(x ) |\\mathbf{\\nabla}v(x)|^{2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\int w_{\\textrm{tf}}[v ] \\left ( -\\mathbf{\\nabla } \\cdot \\frac{\\epsilon(x)}{4\\pi }   \\mathbf{\\nabla } v ( x ) - \\rho_{\\textrm{tf}}[v ] \\right)dx.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in eq .  , @xmath124 $ ] is the helmholtz free energy of a free electron gas in 3d . in the computation of @xmath125 , the chemical potential entering the fermi function",

    "the blue solid curve is obtained from the full schrdinger - poisson calculation whereas the solid points are obtained from eq .   which corresponds to the extremum condition of the functional in eq .  .",

    "minimization of @xmath132 with respect to @xmath30 leads to the condition : [ eq : spequationtf ] ( v(x ) ) + 2qn_cf_1/2(-v(x)-v_)= 0 , where @xmath133 $ ] is the fermi - dirac integral @xcite .",

    "we note that the free - energy functional @xmath132 can be employed to study other quantum nanostructures like quantum dots and quantum wires in the semi - classical regime where the thomas - fermi approximation is valid @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the application of either approximations , lda or tf , preserves the properties associated with our general functional .",
    "in this paper , we have derived the true free - energy functional for the schrdinger - poisson theory .",
    "we have obtained the specific forms of our functional for the case where the local - density and ground - state approximations can be applied , and also for the regime where thomas - fermi limit holds .",
    "our variational formulation also reveals that functionals , such as the nier functional , which are not true free - energy functionals , can be understood as arising from deficient forms of the constraint of sp equation applied to the free energy of the system . in this light , we believe our formulation and the associated free - energy functionals provide a fresh look at the sp theory . on the other hand , our functional can be used for an efficient numerical calculation of the electronic potential in systems obeying schrdinger - poisson physics as it circumvents the usual approach of solving the coupled schrdinger and poisson equations iteratively .",
    "furthermore , our functional offers the prospect of on - the - fly optimization under which the sp equation can be solved in conjunction with the update of external parameters .",
    "schrdinger - poisson theory is equivalent to the self - consistent hartree theory in quantum many body systems . in this light ,",
    "our approach towards finding the free - energy functional can be extended to systems beyond hartree theory .",
    "for example , we can apply the same technique in deriving the free - energy functional for the hartree - fock systems that have an additional density dependent term in the schrdinger - poisson equation due to the exchange - correlation potential@xcite .",

    "<S> in the study of model electronic device systems where electrons are typically under confinement , a key obstacle is the need to iteratively solve the coupled schrdinger - poisson ( sp ) equation . </S>",
