    "a classical definition of young diagram@xcite is the following : the young diagram if size @xmath1 is a finite descending ideal in the lattice @xmath2 , i.e. a set of cells in positive quadrant , which contains a cell @xmath3 only if it contains as well all the sells under @xmath3 in terms of particular order .    standard young table of size @xmath1 is a young diagram whose",
    "cells are filled with numbers in the range from @xmath4 to @xmath1 , which increase in each row and each column . in other words ,",
    "young table is a path in a lattice of young diagrams , which starts at the empty ( zero - sized ) diagram and ends in the given diagram .",
    "young diagrams correspond to irreducible representations of @xmath0 ( see for example  @xcite ) , and the number of young tables that fit into a given young diagram is equal to the dimension of the corresponding irreducible representation . for the sake of brevity",
    "we call this number the dimension of the diagram @xmath5 and denote it as @xmath6 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  2 we will present the results of numerical experiments on asymptotics of a typical ( by plancherel measure ) dimension of irreducible representation of the symmetric group .",
    "this measure was introduced in  @xcite , for further details see  @xcite .",
    "section  3 is devoted to the similar computations of a maximum dimension of irreducible representation of the symmetric group .",
    "the results of section  2 should be considered as a support of a conjecture  @xcite about the existence of a limit value of normalized dimension of a typical @xmath5 by plancherel measure .",
    "this hypothetical limit value is denoted as @xmath7 and called in  @xcite `` specific entropy of an irreducible representation '' .    at the same time , basing on out computations in section  3 , nothing conclusive can be said about the asymptotic behavior of the maximum dimension .",
    "that is , there is no claim that @xmath8 comes to plateau on approachable values of @xmath1 .    in section  4 , we are concerned with another distribution on young diagrams : richardson distribution , which was studied in  @xcite .",
    "we give an experimental evidence of the proved theorem about a limit shape of typical young diagrams .",
    "then we make the similar experiments in three dimensions ( this time the dimension has nothing to do with @xmath0 ) , and form a hypothesis on a 3-dimensional limit shape .",
    "let @xmath9 be the collection of equivalence classes of complex irreducible representations of @xmath0 . for @xmath10 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the dimension of the representation @xmath12 , and by @xmath13 we denote the plancherel measure  @xcite .",
    "this is actually a probabilistic measure on @xmath9 , which we can derive from burnside s conjecture : @xmath14    the set @xmath9 and the dimension @xmath11 have the following interpretation  @xcite : @xmath9 is the ensemble of all young diagrams of size @xmath1 , and @xmath11 is the number of standard young tables that fit into the diagram @xmath12 . in the present article , we make no difference between @xmath12 and the corresponding irreducible representation .",
    "vershik and kerov  @xcite stated the following conjecture : there exists a limit @xmath21 almost everywhere ( by plancherel measure ) on the set of infinite young tables .",
    "infinite young table is an infinite sequence of nested young diagrams of sizes increasing one - by - one : @xmath22 .",
    "the hypothetical limit value is denoted as @xmath7 and called `` specific entropy of an irreducible representation '' .",
    "we are studying the behavior of coefficient @xmath17 w.r.t .",
    "some experiments in this area were undertaken in  @xcite , where the expectation and variance of @xmath17 are given for five values of @xmath1 , 1600 maximum ( for @xmath23 the sample was only 14 diagrams ) .",
    "we have done the same computations on modern hardware , which is far more powerful than 25 years ago",
    ".    * note . *",
    "after we did the described experiments , it was reported of a new paper by alexander bufetov , which gives a proof of existence of a limit @xmath24 of @xmath17 in @xmath25 by plancherel measure : @xmath26    the actual value of @xmath24 is not likely to be obtainable by methods used in bufetov s proof . in should be also noted that the conjecture  @xcite about the existence of a limit if @xmath17 almost everywhere is still open , and if it happens that such a limit value @xmath7 exists , then clearly @xmath27 .",
    "hook formula ( see for example  @xcite ) allows to compute @xmath28 , avoiding the enumeration of all young tables that fit into @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath29 where @xmath3 is a cell of young diagram , and @xmath30 is the length of the hook associated to that cell .",
    "the hook of the cell @xmath3 consists of the cell itself and all cells that are in @xmath31-th row to the right from @xmath3 or in @xmath32-th column above @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ hooks ] )",
    ".            the definition of random young diagram by richardson measure can be easily generalized to three - dimensional case .",
    "there are no known results about the limit shape in this case , but the figure  [ richardson - shape-3d ] , obtained by our computations , leads to assumption that the limit shape complies to similar equation @xmath33 .",
    "this result shows that the limit shape of 3-dimensional young diagrams generated by richardson process are probably different from the limit shape for uniformly - distributed diagrams , which was studied in  @xcite , and finally found in  @xcite ."
