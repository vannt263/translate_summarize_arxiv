    "( 1998 ) find two binaries . a similar rate of occurrence is found for all quasars in the literature : 11 qso pairs in @xmath6 10@xmath8 quasars ( kochanek , falco , and muoz 1999 ) .",
    "this rate is high compared to a naive extrapolation of the quasar  quasar two - point correlation function at megaparsec separations to separations less than 100 kpc ( djorgovski 1991 ) .",
    "the existence of binary quasars , as distinct from the gravitationally lensed pairs , has been established by the occurrence of quasar pairs with only one radio loud member ( e.g. djorgovski et al .",
    "1987 ) and by the statistics of qso pairs with large ( @xmath9 30 ) separations ( kochanek  1999 ) .",
    "kochanek et al .",
    "find that quasar pairs with @xmath10@xmath11 @xmath12 30 are gravitational lenses and that most quasar pairs with @xmath10@xmath11 @xmath13 30 are binary quasars .",
    "the leading explanation for binary quasars is the fueling of quasar activity when two galaxies with massive black holes in their nuclei collide ( kochanek  1999 ) .",
    "the observation that two nearby quasar images have similar emission - line spectra is insufficient to allow classification as a lens ( e.g. mortlock , webster , and francis 1999 ) ; and gravitational lens pairs can have different emission - line spectra due to reddening or time delays .",
    "however , quasar pairs with almost identical redshifts but very different emission - line spectra or bals are probably binary quasars .",
    "the cloverleaf qso , h1413 + 114 , with @xmath14 , is a four image gravitational lens ; all four images show bals ( e.g. monier , turnshek , and lupie 1998 ) .",

    "we report the serendipitous discovery that lbqs 0103@xmath02753 is a binary quasar with a projected separation of 030 on the sky .",
    "the two components show large differences in their emission - line spectra , and only one has bals .",
    "lbqs 0103@xmath02753 is one of eight balqsos observed in a program of hst / stis and ground based spectrophotometry of low and medium redshift balqsos for studies of chemical abundances .",
    "the selection criteria were the presence of bals ( both high and low ionization balqsos were candidates ) , redshift in the range 0.4 @xmath17 @xmath1 @xmath17 1.8 , and high apparent brightness .",
    ", @xmath18 = 0.848 , was chosen based on its apparent magnitude , @xmath19 = 18.1 , and its lbqs survey spectrum showing broad , deep mg ii @xmath202798 absorption around @xmath21 = 0.769 ( morris et al . 1991 ) .",
    "observations of lbqs 0103@xmath02753 were obtained on 1999 july 1718 ( ut ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the stis ccd acquisition image , which involved a 10s integration time in the f28x50lp mode ( transmission from about 5000    to 10,000   , @xmath22 = 7228.5   ) with a standard 100 by 100 subimage readout .",
    "the image has total counts of 1113 and 356 dn for a and b ( formal errors 1.8% , 4.1% ) , respectively , using a 3 pixel radius photometry aperture and a much larger annulus for sky .",
    "the a / b flux ratio is 3.1 , probably a slight underestimate due to the wings of image a leaking into image b. the centroids are separated by @xmath23=0295 @xmath24 0.011 .",
    "the fwhms of the images are 2.1 and 2.3 pixels for a and b , respectively , consistent with point sources .",
    "the position angle ( pa ) of the image @xmath25 axis is pa = @xmath0149.7 , and the pa connecting a and b is @xmath0149.9@xmath26 or + 30.1@xmath26 @xmath24 2.2@xmath26 , with a north and east of b.    the qso pair is almost perfectly aligned with the stis slit , itself aligned along the image + y axis .",
    "a three step peak  up into the 52x0.2 ( 02 wide ) aperture was used for the spectroscopic observations with the stis nuv  mama using the g230l grating .",
    "four orbits gave a total integration time of 10,907  s. the spectra of the two qsos are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the spectra were extracted from the nuv ",

    "the measured separation of the two spectra near the center of the nuv ",
    "mama image is 11.9 pixels or 0295 , in agreement with the acquisition image .",
    "inspection of plots perpendicular to the dispersion shows that the two spectra have very little ( @xmath17 5% ) contamination from each other .",
    "the nominal resolution at 2400    is 2.1 pixels fwhm or 3.3    for the 1.55    per pixel sampling .",
    "the useful wavelength range of the two spectra is from 1650  ( where the s / n @xmath6 1 ) to 3145   .",
    "the s / n in the continuum around 2600    is about 20 per pixel for component a and 11 per pixel for b.    an optical spectrum of lbqs 0103@xmath02753 ( sum of both components ) was obtained obtained on 22 august 1998 ut using the ctio blanco 4 m telescope .",
    "the r  c spectrograph with the blue air schmidt and loral 3k ccd with a 632 line mm@xmath27 grating was used to obtain a 3.0    fwhm resolution spectrum covering 3050    to 5975   .",
    "the spectrum is shown in figure 3 , along with the lbqs spectrum obtained on 26 august 1987 ut by morris et al .",
    "at @xmath1 = 0.848 , the projected separation of 030 amounts to 2.3 kpc (= 70  mpc@xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) . for comparison ,",

    "1999 ) .",
    "the stis spectra of lbqs 0103@xmath02753 a and b show that the two components of this qso pair have very different emission , continuum , and intrinsic absorption characteristics .",
    "component a shows strong bals of c iv @xmath301548,1551 ( @xmath31 to 27,000 ) , si iv @xmath201400 , n v @xmath201240 , and o vi @xmath201034 .",
    "the emission line shapes , equivalent widths , and intensity ratios are different between components a and b.    the two components of other binary qsos agree in emission - line redshift within about 600  ( kochanek et al .",
    "1999 ) . for lbqs",
    "0103@xmath02753 the emission redshifts , @xmath2 = 0.834 and @xmath3 = 0.858 , differ by 3900 .",
    "the centroids of the c iv @xmath201549 emission line profiles above 50% of peak flux level were used to measure the redshifts .",
    "the formal one @xmath32 errors in redshift for components a and b , in velocity units , are 370  and 210 respectively ; and the systematic errors , estimated from different choices for the continuum , are @xmath33  and @xmath34 . for component",
    "b , the ly @xmath35 line gives the same redshift as c iv . for component a , the ly @xmath35 and n  v @xmath201240 emission lines are blended with an unknown ratio of line strengths and an uncertain profile because the n  v bal truncates the feature on the blue side .",
    "the si iv and o iv ] @xmath201400 and o vi @xmath201034 emission lines in component a , with positions marked in figure 2 based on @xmath2 = 0.834 , are probably present but weak and the wavelengths are uncertain because the shapes of the overall features are dominated by the adjacent bals .",
    "the redshift of component a depends entirely on the measurement of the c iv line . however , c  iv emission lines are often blueshifted from the systemic redshift ( e.g. espey et al .",
    "1989 ) ; and weak low contrast lines , like the c  iv emission in a , tend to be shifted the most ( brotherton et al . 1994 ) .",
    "if there was a large blueshift from the systemic value for a and little blueshift from the systemic value for b , the systemic redshifts could be close .",
    "further observations are needed to determine the systemic redshift difference between a and b.    the optical spectrum of lbqs 0103@xmath02753 ( the summed components shown in fig .",
    "3 ) has undergone a large change in 11 years in the observed frame or 6 years in the qso frame .",
    "the mg ii @xmath202798 bal , which is the strongest of the low ionization bals ( voit et al . 1993 ) , has changed from about 50% deep in 1987 to less than 10% deep in 1998 .",
    "the spectrum of lbqs 0103@xmath02753 obtained in august , 1998 , matches the average non  balqso spectrum ( weymann et al . 1991 ) to within 3% between @xmath36 and the base of mg ii .",
    "also the continuum has apparently become bluer from 1987 to 1998 .",
    "low ionization balqsos tend to have redder spectra than balqsos without low ionization lines ( sprayberry and foltz 1992 ) .",
    "the stis spectrum of lbqs 0103@xmath02753 , obtained about 11 months after the optical spectrum of august , 1998 , shows very strong high ionization bals , but no apparent low ionization bals like c ii @xmath201335 . in 6 years in the qso frame , lbqs 0103@xmath02753 a has changed from a low ionization balqso to a high ionization balqso .",
    "this is a large change compared with typical balqso variability ( barlow 1993 ) .",
    "the unusual bal variability was noted ( junkkarinen , cohen , and hamann 1999 ) before the stis observations were obtained that show lbqs 0103@xmath02753 is a binary qso .",
    "if we assume power - law continua @xmath37 for each component , with @xmath38   , the flux ratios of a and b at @xmath39 ( stis ) and @xmath40 ( image ) give @xmath41 , so that b is slightly bluer than a. using the ctio fluxes at @xmath204150 and @xmath42 , we find @xmath43 = -0.66 , -0.86 and @xmath44 in units of @xmath45 . extrapolating the observed spectra to 5500(1+z )   , we find that components a , b have absolute magnitudes @xmath46 , again for @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "the odds of finding two unrelated qsos so close in direction and redshift are negligible .",
    "the very different ultraviolet spectra of lbqs 0103@xmath02753a , b show that this is a true binary , not a lensed qso .",
    "variability , microlensing , and differential reddening might give different spectra or colors for components of a lensed qso .",
    "however , for our pair the expected time delay for a lens is @xmath610 days , and luminous qsos rarely show significant variability over such times .",
    "unequal reddening can not explain the different absorption and emission lines of lbqs 0103@xmath02753a , b ( see lopez  2000 for a related discussion ) .    what is the rate of occurrence of such close binary qsos ?",
    "the  snapshot survey for gravitationally lensed qsos observed 498 qsos with @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( = 100 , = 0.5 ; maoz  1993 , and references therein ) .",
    "no binary qsos with separations less than 10 were found .",
    "our pair slightly misses the redshift cutoff for the snapshot survey , but the angular diameter distance is not a strong function of redshift above z = 0.86 ( see hogg 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "lbqs 0103@xmath02753 also misses the absolute magnitude cutoff by @xmath52 magn .",
    "however , with regard to angular separation and magnitude difference , the snapshot survey provides some guidance . at a separation of 03 ,",
    "the snapshot survey could detect pairs with a magnitude difference @xmath53 at a pa of 0  relative to the image trail , the least favorable pa for detection ( bahcall  1992 ) .",
    "a pair with the spacing and magnitude difference ( @xmath54 ) of lbqs 0103@xmath02753 should have been detected at any pa .",
    "if the snapshot survey accounts for most of the opportunities to detect such a pair to date , the example of lbqs 0103@xmath02753 is consistent with a rate of roughly 1/500 for separations",
    "@xmath603 . among the @xmath55 known qsos ,",
    "there likely are of order 10 unrecognized binaries in the 03 range .",
    "is lbqs 0103@xmath02753 likely to be a chance projection of a wider binary ?",
    "the probability of a qso having a binary companion at 3 to 10 arcseconds is @xmath56 ( djorgovski 1991 ; kochanek  1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "the cases listed by kochanek  have a median separation of @xmath57 ( 40  kpc ) .",
    "the probability that a pair with this physical spacing will have a projected spacing of 03 or less , because it is oriented nearly along the line of sight , is ( coincidentally ) @xmath56 .",
    "the probability that a randomly selected qso will be such a pair , and that it will be so oriented , is then @xmath58 .",
    "then , in a sample of 500 qsos , the probability of finding even one pair at 03 is only @xmath56 .",
    "this suggests that lbqs 0103@xmath02753 is not a chance projection of a @xmath59  kpc binary , but rather has a true spacing not much greater than 2 kpc .",
    "close binary qsos presumably represent mergers of galaxies in which the nuclei in both galaxies are currently active .",
    "observations of nearby galaxies show that the nuclei of large galaxies typically contain supermassive black holes ( , kormendy & richstone 1995 ) .",
    "the merger will likely produce a supermassive binary black hole ( begelman , blandford , & rees 1980 ) .",
    "simulations of colliding disk galaxies by barnes and hernquist ( 1996 ) show little perturbation of the incoming galaxies until the first pericenter passage . however , gas accumulates in the nucleus of each galaxy as the two orbit away from each other . the time to orbit to an apocenter @xmath60  kpc and",
    "fall back is @xmath61 for galactic masses relevant here ( see below ) .",
    "subsequent orbital loops are much smaller , and the central regions of the galaxies merge quickly , entailing a massive concentration of gas in the nucleus .",
    "we speculate that the observed 3  to 10  binary qsos mostly represent galaxy pairs undergoing the loop following the first close encounter , and that lbqs 0103@xmath02753 is in a later stage when the nuclei of the two galaxies are coalescing .",
    "is the incidence of @xmath62 binaries consistent with this scenario ?",
    "the time for the orbit to decay from radius @xmath63 to the center by dynamical friction is @xmath64 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ; mortlock  1999 , and references therein ) . here",
    "@xmath65 is the mass of the orbiting black hole ( units @xmath66 ) , assumed to be the smaller hole on a circular orbit through the stellar background of the larger galaxy ( velocity dispersion @xmath67 ) .",
    "let us assume that each qso is shining at one - third of the eddington limit ( see kaspi  2000 ) and take @xmath68 following laor ( 1998 ) .",
    "then @xmath69 for a , b ; and the black hole masses are @xmath70",
    ". the recently discovered correlation of black hole mass with bulge velocity dispersion , @xmath71 ( gebhardt  2000 , ferrarese and merritt 2000 ) gives @xmath72 .",
    "the total bulge masses should be @xmath73 ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) .",
    "tidal radius considerations suggest that the dense core of the stellar nucleus of galaxy b remains intact around black hole b , with a total mass @xmath74 .",
    "this shortens the dynamical friction time , and the above formula then suggests that the orbit decays on the dynamical timescale of @xmath75 years .",
    "the discovery of lbqs 0103@xmath02753 then indicates that the probability of both nuclei being active as qsos during the 2 kpc stage of a merger is @xmath76 times higher than during the 40 kpc phase .",
    "simulations of galactic mergers including supermassive black holes could help to clarify these timescales .",
    "ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs , @xmath77 ) typically involve mergers , the mean nuclear spacing being @xmath4 kpc ( sanders and mirabel 1996 ; genzel and cesarsky 2000 ) . for high luminosities , the predominant power source appears to be agn activity that is heavily obscured by a large mass of nuclear gas and dust . from this perspective , an important aspect of lbqs 0103@xmath02753 is the lack of heavy extinction , perhaps because the high qso luminosity has dispersed the nuclear gas .",
    "infrared observations of lbqs 0103@xmath02753 would be most interesting , as would observations that could detect a large mass of atomic or molecular gas expanding away from the nucleus .",
    "the discovery of lbqs 0103@xmath02753 suggests that binaries with separations of several kpc occur with a frequency of order one or two per thousand qsos .",
    "the detection of just a few more cases would provide a better estimate of this rate , providing an important constraint on galactic mergers and the fueling of active galactic nuclei .",
