    "a voronoi tessellation is a partition of space according to certain neighborhood relations of a given set of generators ( points ) in this space . initially proposed by dirichlet for special cases @xcite ,",
    "the method was established by voronoi more than 100 years ago @xcite .",
    "the geometric dual of the voronoi tessellation was proposed by delaunay in 1934  and therefore is called delaunay triangulation .",
    "it connects those points of a voronoi tessellation that share a common border .",
    "since the latter can be directly constructed out of the former , both terms are sometimes used equivalently . in the following years",
    ", the method was rediscovered throughout other fields , which accounts for many other names designating the very concept , such as thiessen polygons @xcite in meteorology or wigner - seitz cells @xcite and brillouin zones @xcite in solid state physics . with the technological and scientific advance , the method became feasible in computational geometry @xcite , and since then has widely evolved , @xcite , making it appealing for biological applications .",
    "in particular , voronoi tessellations have been applied to represent various aggregates of cells and swarming animals .",
    "initially , honda proposed the method in two spatial dimensions @xcite .",
    "the first applications to biological tissue were cell sorting simulations , however starting from artificially shaped quadratic cells @xcite .",
    "then , morphogenesis and its underlying intercellular mechanisms were studied starting from a pure delaunay mesh and simulating vertex dynamics @xcite , yet without using voronoi tessellations explicitly .",
    "in contrast , by applying transformation rules like mitosis combined with monte - carlo dynamics , evolving multicellular tissue was represented by voronoi tessellations @xcite . in particular ,",
    "growth instabilities , blastula formation and gastrulation could be conceived within this framework @xcite .",
    "similar effects were reproduced by using vertex dynamics @xcite .",
    "moreover , cell organization in the intestinal crypt was modelled using spring forces and restricting the motion to a cylindrical surface @xcite .",
    "an application to bird swarming together with the proposal of a continuum formulation was given in @xcite .",
    "finally , the influence of shear stress on the evolution of two - dimensional tissues was studied @xcite .",
    "only quite recently voronoi tessellations have been extended to be used as a model for three dimensional tissue , again using vertex dynamics @xcite .",
    "other authors use optimized kinetic algorithms @xcite to employ generalized voronoi tessellations ( discussed as difference method in this article ) , with cell - cell and cell - matrix adhesion @xcite .",
    "marginal cells have been closed by prescribing a maximal cell radius , enabling the study of the growth dynamics of epithelial cell populations @xcite .",
    "so far , however , the cell - cell boundaries were exclusively represented by flat hypersurfaces .",
    "in contrast , when observing two - dimensional monolayers of keratinocytes , for example @xcite , the cell - cell contact borders visible from staining cadherin - complexes frequently appear as circular arcs , whose shape and length seems to be determined by the constellation and size distribution of neighboring cells .",
    "moreover , the forces between such cells are influenced by filament networks or bundles meeting at the cell - cell junctions and eventually balanced by elastic counterforces @xcite .",
    "therefore , a geometrical and dynamical modeling framework is required that reproduces the observed cell shapes and simultaneously allows for quantifying the cell - cell interaction forces as well as the active locomotion forces appearing at the free cell boundaries . here",
    "we present a simple and effective solution of this task by using a suitably weighted voronoi tessellation .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section [ sec : voronoi_tesselation ] voronoi tessellations are introduced in a general manner .",
    "next , two types of weighted square distance functions are introduced , using the method of difference and quotient , respectively , and their particular consequences for cell tissue modeling are investigated . inspired by the intricate interplay between cytoskeletal filament bundles and cadherin - catenin cohesion or integrin adhesion sites , the forces on the intercellular and exterior cell borders are proposed in section [ sec : forces ] after discussing the emergence of cell shape within our model .",
    "then the dynamics of a whole cell aggregate is defined , directly leading to analytical results on cell pair contacts in section [ sec : pair_contacts ] .",
    "after simulation studies of meta - stable states during tissue equilibration and robustness of tissue formation under the influence of various model parameters in section [ sec : sim ] we conclude with a discussion of our results in section [ sec : results ] .",

    "these weights @xmath34 are assumed to be strictly monotonically increasing functions of the cell body radius @xmath35 , with the intended effect that stronger weights induce larger cell sizes , by shifting the voronoi contact borders outwards .",
    "importantly , different choices of how @xmath7 depends on @xmath36 could lead to different cell shapes .",
    "out of many possible generalizations of voronoi tessellations ( for a review see @xcite ) , we only discuss two straight - forward ways here , which are determined by the set of all cell center positions , body radii and weights @xmath37 .",
    "the partition of space into cells is obtained by a voronoi tessellation using the euclidean square distance function with subtracted weights @xmath38 which has previously been used in @xcite without and in @xcite with weights @xmath36 .    for the following",
    "we denote @xmath39 the cell pair mid - point , @xmath40 the euclidean cell center distance , and @xmath41 the unit vector of the oriented axis connecting the two cell centers .",
    "thus , from equation ( [ eq : pi_eq_pj ] ) the condition for a point @xmath11 to be located on the contact border @xmath17 reads as @xmath42 being equivalent to a linear hyper - plane equation . as for the classical voronoi partition ,",
    "the contact @xmath22-plane between two neighboring cells @xmath43 is perpendicular to the vector connecting the cell centers .",

    "thus , and to clarify the interrelations between the conformations ( a - d ) , we investigate ( a ) and ( b ) in longer simulations . to this end , by starting from the configurations ( a ) and ( b ) ( see figure [ fig : tunnel ] ) , both tissues have been evolved for @xmath414 additional hours of simulation time . in order to characterize the shape of tissue with respect to global and elongated shape ,",

    "apart from stochastic fluctuations and an initial equilibration phase for @xmath421 , both observables attain a constant value for time series ( a ) .",
    "in contrast , for time series ( b ) there appear distinct states between @xmath422 and @xmath423 .",
    "indeed these observations are reflected by the actual evolution of the tissue .",
    "while the topology of the tissue does not change after @xmath424 for time series ( a ) ( see supplementary http://www.theobio.uni-bonn.de/people/mab/sup01/index.html[`mova.avi ` ] ) , tissue ( b ) ( http://www.theobio.uni-bonn.de/people/mab/sup01/index.html[`movb.avi ` ] ) goes through several different conformational states . at @xmath425",
    "it attains the same topology as conformation ( c ) , identifying ( c ) as a transient state ( http://www.theobio.uni-bonn.de/people/mab/sup01/index.html[`movc.avi ` ] ) .",

    "moreover , the time series of conformation ( b ) in figure [ fig : tunneltime ] suggests , that during @xmath432 the tissue already attains a shape of similar compactness and stability as in figure [ fig : tunnel](a ) .",
    "nevertheless , the delaunay mesh ( green lines ) is not convex there ( http://www.theobio.uni-bonn.de/people/mab/sup01/index.html[`movb.avi ` ] ) , which explains this surprising instability .",
    "it appears , that the stability of a tissue is related to its globular shape .",
    "this is not a surprise , since the stochastic forces in equation ( [ eq : free_boundary_force ] ) are defined only on free cell boundaries @xmath114 , and therefore act only on marginal cells .",
    "thus , by minimizing the extent of all @xmath114 , a maximal circularity minimizes stochastic perturbations , which enhances the stability of the tissue . additionally , for a tissue to change its topology , its cells have to overcome barriers as imposed by the other cells .",
    "for example , cell @xmath23 has to displace cell @xmath412 in http://www.theobio.uni-bonn.de/people/mab/sup01/index.html[`movb.avi ` ] at @xmath433 in order to make contact with @xmath24 .",
    "depending on the particular configuration , the severity of these barriers might range from prohibitive to practically non - existent .",
    "influenced by the strength of the stochastic interactions , these barriers then determine the time scale of further relaxation to equilibrium . in this sense , the notion of equilibrium is directly related to an inherent time scale . according to the previous evolution of the tissue , there may be several stable topological conformations for a given time scale .      in order to explore the ramifications of piecewise",
    "spherical cells within our model framework , we study the influence of @xmath115 and @xmath434 on tissue formation . to this end , a simulation has been performed starting from an exemplary configuration as in figure [ fig : vor_closure ] with @xmath435 and @xmath436 .",
    "after @xmath418 , either @xmath434 or @xmath242 was modified to a nearby parameter position as indicated in figure [ fig : pmaxtyp ] ,     and @xmath434 , where @xmath436 , and @xmath437 .",
    "when increased , both parameters lead to an increased tissue size . for sufficiently large @xmath434 , the tissue eventually dissociates .",

    ", scaledwidth=98.0% ]    and the simulation was continued for further @xmath418 .",
    "this procedure was repeated until the whole panel in [ fig : pmaxtyp ] was filled with the final tissue configurations .    for fixed @xmath117 , the overall size of the tissue",
    "is determined by both @xmath242 , defining the free cell radius @xmath158 in units of @xmath35 , and @xmath434 , presetting the equilibrium cell - cell body distance in units of @xmath201 , see equations ( [ eq : rif ] ) , ( [ eq : fcyt ] ) and ( [ eq : deltru ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , in figure [ fig : pmaxtyp ] , the overall tissue extension increases from left to right and from top to bottom .",
    "furthermore , for given @xmath434 , tissues with higher @xmath242 exhibit a rather compact , almost quadratic shape .",
    "we speculate that this is due to spontaneous formation of distinct protrusions arising from stochastic perturbations and leading to an increase of locomotion at the corners .",
    "in contrast , tissues with lower @xmath242 feature more irregular margins . similarly , for given @xmath242 , larger values of @xmath434 yield more irregularity , most pronounced directly before dissociation of the tissue .    apparently , the emerging interaction forces are sufficiently strong for tissue aggregation only if there is enough space for the adaptation of neighboring cell lamellae .",
    "this space serves as a cushion for accommodating near - range repulsion from multiple neighbor cells and at the same time poses a resistance to stochastic perturbations by mid - range neighbor cell attraction , see figure [ fig : deltfloc ] .",
    "otherwise the tissue dissociates , leading to isolated cells exclusively driven by stochastic perturbations . in order to quantify these findings , consider the relative lamella width @xmath440 and the dimensionless cell overlap @xmath441 defined by @xmath442 inserting the marginal values @xmath443 and @xmath434 of those tissues in figure [ fig : pmaxtyp ] that are not yet dissociated , one recognizes that the product @xmath444 is approximately constant , with @xmath445 ,     and the dimensionless cell overlap @xmath441 .",
    "the line @xmath446 separates associating from dissociating tissues and was determined from a linear regression against @xmath447 .",
    "see also the explanations in the text .",
    ", scaledwidth=60.0% ]    see figure [ fig : sprod ] .",
    "this @xmath448 can be identified as a threshold value guaranteeing tissue coherence under the condition @xmath449 where @xmath448 eventually depends on the other parameters , which were fixed here .",
    "this confirms that for tissue aggregation to occur , @xmath443 and with it the relative lamella width @xmath440 must be sufficiently large .    on the other hand , we have established this result under the tissue homogeneity condition ( [ eq : pmax_max ] ) guaranteeing starlikeness of cells , which now can be rewritten as @xmath450 with @xmath451 defining the maximal dimensionless overlap . since @xmath452 by construction , inequality ( [ eq : starlike2 ] ) always holds for very high cell size homogeneities @xmath453 .",
    "however , for lower @xmath245 there is an upper bound on @xmath440 restricting the available space for the cell lamellae .",
    "if , in addition , starlikeness of cells is enforced for all possible neighborhood constellations , then @xmath245 has to be replaced by @xmath154 , see equation ( [ eq : pmax_max1 ] ) .",
    "in this way the relations ( [ eq : condsprod ] ) and ( [ eq : starlike2 ] ) lead to the sufficient condition for tissue coherence @xmath454 from these estimates we finally conclude that for given model force parameters ( @xmath250 , @xmath434 , @xmath389 , @xmath402 , @xmath303 , @xmath403 ) the formation of integer tissue aggregates with overall starlike cells is guaranteed within a certain finite range of the free cell size parameter @xmath443 , where the upper bound decreases with an increasing ratio @xmath455 of extremal cell body radii . within the limits of inequality ( [ eq : starlike3 ] ) the lamellae regions are wide enough to perform the necessary deformations by adapting to the surrounding neighbors through shape changes .",
    "thus , nature s freedom in developing aggregating tissues may be constrained by a tradeoff between the relative size of cells with respect to their bodies ( @xmath443 ) and the cell size heterogeneity ( @xmath456 ) .",
    "in this article we have investigated the emergence of tissue aggregation using finite , generalized voronoi neighborhoods as a basis for the description of cells within epithelial tissues .",
    "it was shown that the two - dimensional geometric structure observed in tissues , in particular the circular shape of contact arcs and the size distribution of cells can be captured by the experimentally accessible characteristics of cell body radii @xmath117 and the relative extension @xmath115 of the lamellae .",
    "the quotient method defined by equation ( [ eq : ratrule_part ] ) with unique weight factors @xmath65 implements the expected partition of influence regions and additionally suggests the definition of directed force densities on the contact and free boundaries . in contrast , the difference method is not appropriate , because the influence region of a cell growing in size becomes reduced within a cell pair .",
    "nevertheless this method has been used previously for modelling three - dimensional tissue dynamics @xcite . by using the particular additive weights @xmath65 ,",
    "the specific geometrical properties ( `` orthocircles '' ) allow for a dense regular triangulation of space between neighboring cell bodies even in the case of overlap , see @xcite for details .    in the asymptotic case of two cells in brief contact , @xmath457 ,",
    "the approximate equations of overdamped motion without persistence were treated analytically .",
    "thereby , the contact singularity at the rupture points could be resolved and a stationary probability distribution was found under the assumption that separated cells indirectly attract each other due to biased locomotion .",
    "corresponding simulations confirm that in the case of dominating attraction , contact parameter @xmath342 , there is indeed a unique , stable equilibrium position facilitating cell - cell attachment after the first contact .",
    "the simulations of multicellular dynamics , figure [ fig : pmaxtyp ] , reveal a surprising richness of tissue structure , with emerging shapes from elongated to globular and from compact quadratic to irregular and dispersed . ranging from widely spread to tightly contracted",
    ", different lamella protrusions appear for varying @xmath115 .",
    "similarly , within a more or less compressed tissue as in figure [ fig : vor_closure ] , single cells attain varying forms from almost circular at the margins to polygonal in the interior .",
    "moreover , distinct stresses throughout the tissue lead to both narrowly compressed or widely stretched cell shapes .    furthermore , due to the stochastic nature of neighbor constellation and cell - cell interactions , different stable tissue configurations may evolve from the same starting configuration .",
    "the underlying dynamical time scales vary over several orders of magnitude .",
    "this can be interpreted in terms of an incomplete balance of competing interactions within a system . in the course of relaxation to equilibrium ,",
    "this is known to cause _ frustration _ , meaning that the system ends up in a local minimum of the involved ( generalized ) free energy @xcite .",
    "thus , the structure of the proposed anisotropic and active force interactions exhibits interesting non - trivial features , yet it is sufficiently elementary to allow for a rigorous treatment under certain further assumptions .    finally , the limits of aggregation due to a prohibitively small tissue coherence threshold @xmath448 have been explored .",
    "this leads to our main result following from purely geometric arguments : in proposition [ prop : starlike ] we have derived that relatively large lamellae extensions @xmath115 are restricted by the cell size homogeneity @xmath245 when requiring starlikeness of cells . on biological grounds one might argue that not all observed cells are starlike ( in the mathematical sense ) . in such a case , however , the exertion of forces onto neighboring cells is certainly hindered  especially in cell regions that can not be reached by radial filaments .",
    "there , the necessary centro - radial support of the apical actin cortex may be weakened due to the necessary bending of filament bundles . reversing the argument , for the cell to provide macroscopic stability within the tissue ,",
    "it is beneficial to attain a starlike shape .",
    "several model refinements are of interest . on the cell biological side ,",
    "cell division is a commonly observed phenomenon , having special consequences for pattern formation and self - organization during embryonic development . in this direction also",
    "the growth of cells , or even the complete cell cycle including necrosis or apoptosis could be considered . on the mathematical side",
    "more elaborate stochastics , such as differentially modeled stochastic forces on the free boundaries as well as on the contact borders could be implemented . in particular , in the light of recent experimental results @xcite , varying filament orientations or binding and unbinding processes of linker molecules might be considered .",
    "moreover , we emphasize that a three - dimensional generalization of the multiplicatively weighted voronoi tessellation is straight - forward , opening a wide potential for applications , for example epidermal tissue organization in the intestinal crypt without artificially imposed constraints .",
    "finally , explicit variables for cell polarization and reorganization of the cytoskeleton could possibly lead to refined dynamics closer resembling the behavior observed _ in vivo_.    * acknowledgements : * we thank d.  br , g.  schaller and m.  meyer - hermann for helpful discussions , and g.  wenzel and g.  kirfel for providing us with microscopic pictures .",
