    "electrostatic interactions play a crucial role in colloidal dispersions  @xcite . when colloidal particles are immersed in electrolyte solutions , the so - called electric double layer is formed .",
    "the electric double layer is a cloud of counterions dissociated from the surfaces of the colloids into the solvent surrounding the colloidal particles .",
    "most counterions are localized within the double layer due to the electrostatic attractive interactions between counterions and the inversely charged colloidal surfaces , while the entropy of the counterions tends to delocalize them .",
    "the thickness of the double layer is then determined by the competition between these conflicting effects .",
    "the static density profiles of the counterions can be calculated properly using the poisson  boltzmann theory , and",
    "its linearized version leads to the well - known screened coulomb interaction for a pair of likely charged colloids .",
    "although the screened coulomb potential is widely used to simulate charged colloidal dispersions , the linearization is justified only for large interparticle separations .",
    "deviations from screened coulomb interaction become notable for the interparticle separation smaller than the debye screening length .",
    "furthermore , many - body interactions become significant for dense colloidal dispersions .",
    "we thus need an alternative framework which is applicable for simulating dense dispersions composed of many charged colloids .    in principle , the above problems can be resolved properly if molecular dynamics ( md ) or monte carlo ( mc ) simulations are used with treating counterions explicitly as millions of charged particles . from a computational point of view , however , such fully microscopic simulations are prohibitively inefficient because of the huge asymmetries both in size and time scales between colloidal particles ( large and slow ) and counterions ( small and fast ) .",
    "an enormous number of counterions and simulation steps are required even for a system composed of only a few colloidal particles .",
    "alternatively , counterions can be modeled as a coarse - grained continuum object which is governed by a set of partial differential equations ( pdes ) with appropriate boundary conditions defined at the fluid - colloid interface as demonstrated in some previous studies @xcite rather than microscopic particles governed by newton s equations of motion .",
    "this idea can be most simply implemented by utilizing the finite element method ( fem ) , which is a very natural and sensible method to simulate solid particles with arbitrary shapes in a discrete computational space .",
    "several boundary - fitted unstructured mesh have been applied to specific problems , so that the shapes of the particles are properly expressed  @xcite .",
    "thus , in principle it is possible to apply this method to dispersions consisting of many particles with any shape .",
    "however , a numerical inefficiency arises from the following : i ) re - constructions of the irregular mesh are necessary at every simulation step according to the temporal particle positions , and ii ) pdes must be solved under boundary conditions imposed on the surfaces of all colloidal particles .",
    "the computational demands thus are enormous for systems involving many particles , even if the shapes are all spherical .    in order to overcome the problems mentioned above ,",
    "a new idea was put forwarded by lwen _",
    "et al . _ for their first principle md simulations of charged colloidal dispersions @xcite .",
    "utilizing a pseudopotential , this method enabled us to use the conventional cartesian coordinate and to calculate the force acting on each particle due to the solvents efficiently . in the present paper , we extend this idea by introducing a smoothed profile function @xmath0 to represent the colloid - solvent interface with a finite thickness @xmath1 .",
    "the validity of the method is examined in some simple situations with changing the interface thickness @xmath1 .",
    "then the efficiency of the method is demonstrated by simulating two - dimensional dispersions , which resulted in the formation of colloidal crystals .",
