    "the observational discovery of the late - time cosmic acceleration from the supernovae type ia ( sn ia ) opened up a new research area in modern cosmology @xcite . about 70% of the energy density of the universe today consists of an unknown component called dark energy .",
    "this has been also confirmed by other observations such as cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite .",
    "the property of dark energy is characterized by the equation of state @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the pressure and @xmath5 is the energy density .",
    "dark energy has a negative pressure with @xmath0 less than @xmath6 .",
    "one of the simplest candidates of dark energy is the cosmological constant @xmath1 with @xmath7 .",
    "the cosmological constant can arise from a vacuum energy in particle physics , but its energy scale is enormously larger than the observed energy scale of dark energy @xcite .",
    "there have been many attempts to construct de sitter vacua in supersymmetric theories . in string theory ,",
    "for example , huge numbers of de sitter vacua ( @xmath8 ) can be present after the so - called flux compactification of higher - dimensional manifolds @xcite .",
    "we may live in a vacuum with a tiny vacuum energy , but it is generally difficult to justify the reason for living such a specific vacuum unless some anthropic principle is introduced .",
    "so far , it is fair to say that there is no satisfactory scenario where the small energy scale of dark energy can be naturally explained by the vacuum energy related to particle physics .",
    "if the cosmological constant problem is solved in a way that it vanishes completely , we need to find out an alternative mechanism to explain the origin of dark energy @xcite . broadly speaking",
    ", we can classify dark energy models into two classes . the first one is based on a specific form of matter such as quintessence @xcite , k - essence @xcite , and the chaplygin gas @xcite .",
    "the second one is based on the modification of gravity at large distances ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) . in both classes",
    "the dark energy equation of state dynamically changes in time , by which the models can be distinguished from the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "quintessence is described by a canonical scalar field @xmath9 minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "compared to other scalar - field models such as phantoms and k - essence , quintessence is the simplest scalar - field scenario without having theoretical problems such as the appearance of ghosts and laplacian instabilities .",
    "a slowly varying field along a potential @xmath10 can lead to the acceleration of the universe .",
    "this mechanism is similar to slow - roll inflation in the early universe , but the difference is that non - relativistic matter ( dark matter and baryons ) can not be ignored to discuss the dynamics of dark energy correctly .",
    "moreover , the energy scale of the quintessence potential needs to be of the order of @xmath11  gev@xmath12 today , which is much smaller than that of the inflaton potential .",
    "the dynamics of quintessence in the presence of non - relativistic matter has been studied in detail for many different potentials @xcite .",
    "depending on the evolution of @xmath0 , we can broadly classify quintessence models into two classes @xcite : ( i ) thawing models and ( ii ) freezing models . in the first class , the field",
    "is nearly frozen by a hubble friction during the early cosmological epoch and it starts to evolve once the field mass drops below the hubble expansion rate . in the second class ,",
    "the evolution of the field gradually slows down because the potential tends to be shallow at late times . for the inverse power - law potential @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , there is so - called a tracker solution @xcite along which @xmath0 is nearly constant during the matter era and @xmath0 starts to decrease after that .",
    "this case belongs to a subclass of freezing models . for thawing and",
    "tracker models there exist convenient analytic formulas of @xmath0 @xcite employed to test the models with the data of distance measurements of sn ia , cmb , and bao .",
    "the redshift - space distortions ( rsd ) appearing in clustering pattern of galaxies @xcite can provide additional constraints on the growth rate of matter perturbations @xmath15 . since the evolution of @xmath15 is different depending on the field equation of state @xcite , it is possible to place bounds on @xmath0 from the data of rsd .",
    "in fact there exist analytic formulas of @xmath15 and its growth rate @xcite , which can be used to constrain quintessence models .    in order to realize the cosmic acceleration today",
    ", the mass @xmath16 of quintessence ( defined by @xmath17 ) needs to be extremely small , i.e. , @xmath18ev , where @xmath19 is the today s hubble parameter . in general",
    "there is a difficulty to reconcile such a ultra light mass with the energy scales appearing in particle physics @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the absence of some symmetry , the radiative corrections may disrupt the flatness of the quintessence potentials required for the cosmic acceleration @xcite .",
    "however , it is not entirely hopeless to construct viable quintessence models in the framework of particle physics @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we review several cosmological aspects of quintessence including its cosmological dynamics , analytic solutions of @xmath0 , observational constraints , and particle physics models .",
    "the review is organized as follows . in sec.[aba : sec2 ] we present the field equations of motion for general quintessence potentials and then proceed to the analysis of fixed points for exponential potentials . in sec.[aba : sec3 ] we classify quintessence potentials into two classes depending on the evolution of @xmath0 and then derive analytic solutions of @xmath0 .",
    "these solutions are employed to put observational bounds on quintessence at the background level . in sec.[aba : sec4 ] we derive analytic formulas for the growth rate of matter density perturbations and discuss constraints on some of quintessence models from the recent data of rsd . in sec.[aba : sec5 ] we review theoretical models of quintessence based on supersymmetric theories .",
