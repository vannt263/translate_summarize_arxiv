    "in addition to the large changes corresponding to the doping of holes into the chain layer , oxygen doping also dopes holes into the cuo@xmath0 planes . as in other cuprates such as lsco , @xcite this doping produces a shoulder in the @xmath54 or @xmath53 spectrum ( at 932.8 ev ) corresponding to @xmath55 .    in carefully annealed high - purity samples",

    "all else being equal , this comparison indicates that , if present , static cdw order in ybco would have a magnitude @xmath72 weaker than 1/8 doped lbco .",
    "if static cdw order is not present , a likely possibility is that cdw order in ybco is dynamic rather than static.@xcite ybco may be similar to la@xmath13sr@xmath14cuo@xmath15 ( as opposed to nd - doped lsco , lbco or eu - doped lsco ) where sdw order@xcite has been observed , but the static cdw order that should accompany sdw order has not.@xcite as noted by kimura et al .",
    "@xcite , this can possibly be reconciled by considering that charge stripe order is intrinsically disordered , rendering it too weak to be detected by x - ray and neutron diffraction measurements .",

    "the 3@xmath1013 scattering tensor @xmath102 captures any anisotropy in the scattering form factor .",
    "although the outgoing polarization was not measured , the local symmetry of the cu1e and cu1f sites imply that only @xmath103 or @xmath104 scattering is allowed .",

    "while it is clear that the resonant scattering intensity can in principle be calculated from the x - ray absorption , a complication arises in that the measured x - ray absorption is a sum over contributions from all atoms in the material . as such , it is often difficult to calculate the resonant scattering intensity from the x - ray absorption without some means to isolate the contribution to the total x - ray absorption from individual atoms . in ortho - ii",
    "ordered ybco , we make use of x - ray absorption measurements on different samples that have either entirely empty chains ( @xmath20 ) or entirely full chains ( @xmath19 ) in order to deduce @xmath57 and @xmath56 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_f ] , @xmath118 and @xmath119 are shown for cu1e and cu1f for @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",

    "errors in this procedure have a tendency to introduce energy independent offsets in the value of @xmath120 .",
    "however , because constant offsets in @xmath120 occur for both @xmath56 and @xmath57 and ultimately cancel in eqn .",
    "[ eq : iscatt ] , the calculated scattering intensity between 920 ev and 960 ev is only weakly sensitive to different extrapolation methods .",

    "the agreement between the calculated and measured spectra is very good , with accurate reproducibility of the relative intensities of the @xmath46 and @xmath129 spectra , as well as the relative intensity of the @xmath40 and @xmath67 edges .",
    "this agreement provides strong confirmation of our approach of using xas measurements to interpret the resonant scattering .    the main difference between the experiment and calculations seems to be an extra broadening in the calculated scattering intensity that is not apparent in the measurement .",

    "this may occur if a different core - hole lifetime broadening enters into xas and rsxs .",
    "in particular , the elastic scattering process , which requires the energy of the incident and scattered photons to be the same , may act in a similar fashion to using high resolution fluorescence spectroscopy to eliminate core - hole broadening in xas spectra.@xcite    the good agreement between experiment and calculation also indicates that the scattering intensity is almost entirely the result of charge ordering in the chains , since we have neglected charge ordering in the planes .",
    "this conclusion is in contrast to the results of feng et al . , who argued for a sizeable in - plane modulation based on the polarization dependence of the cu @xmath3 edge rsxs lineshape.@xcite however , contrary to the analysis of feng _ et al .",
    "_ , our detailed analysis of the resonant scattering lineshape indicates that the measurements do not have sufficient sensitivity to the cuo@xmath0 planes to address the issue of in - plane ordering .",
    "similar to the chain contribution to the resonant x - ray scattering , contributions to the rsxs cross - section from the cuo@xmath0 planes can be determined from a kramers - kronig transform of the x - ray absorption .",
    "similar to the hole modulation of the cu1 in the chain layer , for a hole modulation in the cu2 sites , the structure factor is such that the scattering amplitude should depend on the difference in @xmath7 at the different cu2 sites .",
    "in contrast , if the cu2 were subject to a lattice displacement from their ideal lattice positions , the structure factor is such that scattering intensity will depend on the overall magnitude of @xmath7 at the cu2 sites , producing a peak in the scattering roughly where the cu @xmath3 xas is peaked .",
    "this latter case is consistent with the scattering intensity at the cu @xmath3 edge observed at the cdw superlattice in la@xmath13ba@xmath14cuo@xmath15 and la@xmath16eu@xmath17sr@xmath14cuo@xmath15.@xcite however , because of the crystal symmetry about the cu2 site in ortho - ii ybco , one would not expect a lattice displacement of cu2 due to the ortho - ii order and the scattering amplitude should depend on the difference in @xmath7 at the different cu2 sites .",
    "as noted above , the doping of charge carriers in the cuo@xmath0 planes is evidenced in the cu @xmath3 edge xas by a shoulder that arises off the main peak at @xmath130 ev for @xmath54 or @xmath58 ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_f ] ) .",
    "comparison with xas measurement on lsco , which has only a single in - plane cu site , indicates that this shoulder feature exhibits the largest changes with doping ( a weaker feature with @xmath46 also shows some doping dependence).@xcite from fig.[fig_f ] ( top panel ) we can quantify the magnitude of the difference in the scattering form factor for the cu2 sites at 931.6 ev . around 931.6 ev ,",
    "the maximum difference between @xmath131 and @xmath132 is 13.5@xmath121 .",
    "this difference corresponds to a difference of @xmath133 electrons per cu in the plane ( the difference in the in - plane hole doping between undoped and fully doped ybco ) .",

    "in addition , for @xmath104 scattering with @xmath134 , the scattering amplitude from the cuo@xmath0 planes is reduced by @xmath135 .",
    "thus , the scattering amplitude in units of @xmath136 from the planes can be estimated to be @xmath137 .",
    "this contribution to the scattering would be very difficult to detect when compared with the scattering from the chains , which has a magnitude of @xmath138 around 931.6 ev .    finally , in fig .  [ fig5 ] we present the scattering intensity as a function of photon energy for the [ 0.35 , 0 0 ] superlattice peak of ortho - viii .",
    "the intensity of the superlattice peak is significantly weaker in ortho - viii relative to ortho - ii ordered ybco .",
