    "the lattice technique of studying field theories such as qcd ( the strong force of particle physics ) has had a long and successful history@xcite . in this method ,",
    "the usual computational modelling trick of discretising space - time , and replacing derivatives by finite differences is employed .",
    "this allows the study of field theories at any value of the coupling , and contrasts with perturbation theory which is restricted to systems where the interaction strength is weak .",
    "for this reason , the lattice technique is particularly applicable to calculations involving the strong interaction of particle physics , and is now regarded as the method of choice for its study .",
    "it has the advantage over of its competitors in that it has no model assumptions , and is also systematically improvable .    historically , due to computational resource issues ,",
    "lattice simulations have used the `` quenched '' approximation ( which ignores virtual quark loops in the vacuum ) . now that computer power is in the teraflop region , lattice qcd studies are able to simulate without this approximation .    the ukqcd collaboration@xcite has played a leading role in the study of qcd via the lattice technique .",
    "most of the present emphasis of this collaboration is the study of hadrons using `` full '' ( i.e. `` unquenched '' ) qcd . a summary of recent results will be given ( see @xcite for details ) and an exciting new approach to obtaining spectral information from the lattice based on the `` maximum entropy method '' will be discussed .",
    "the main computer resource of the ukqcd collaboration is currently a cray t3e in edinburgh , however this will soon be strengthened by the acquisition of an apemille computer in swansea .",
    "furthermore , funding has been approved for a supercomputer in the multi - teraflop range in the medium term .",
    "in lattice qcd , the quark degrees of freedom are defined on the sites of the 4-dimensional lattice , and the gluonic degrees of freedom ( corresponding to the carriers of the strong force ) are defined on the links .",
    "this enables a lattice version of the theory to be defined which maintains as many of the symmetries of the continuum theory as possible .",
    "( for a reviews of lattice qcd see @xcite . )",
    "typical quantities of interest can then be expressed as @xmath0-point functions , @xmath1 , of hadronic operators . specifically these are weighted averages over configurations of the degrees of freedom with a boltzmann - like weight , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the lattice version of the continuum qcd action .",
    "it is important to note that this is exactly analogous to statistical mechanics .",
    "this means that many of the techniques developed in that area are applied to lattice qcd  for example the use of the monte carlo integration method .",
    "quantities of physical interest , such as hadronic masses , can be extracted from calculations of the 2-point function @xmath4 as follows .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath5 the sum is over all states @xmath6 with the same quantum numbers as the operators which define the 2-point function , @xmath4 .",
    "hence the ground state mass of a hadron , @xmath7 , can be extracted simply by fitting @xmath4 to an exponential at sufficiently large times @xmath8 .",
    "this is not the end of the story though because @xmath7 ( and any other quantity extracted from a lattice calculation ) is a function of the input parameters of the simulation .",
    "these are the coupling strength @xmath9 , the quark mass @xmath10 and the volume @xmath11 .",
    "ideally what is required is the continuum limit ( @xmath12 ) of @xmath7 which corresponds to @xmath13 ( since qcd is asymptotically free ) .",
    "however , as has been found by several groups ( e.g. @xcite ) , the quark mass @xmath10 also has impact on the lattice spacing @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 .",
    "this will have an important implication as we will see in a moment .",
    "another issue regarding lattice qcd is the error which is introduced in the discretisation of the continuum theory . in the conventional approach ,",
    "the lattice action reproduces the continuum action only up to terms of @xmath16 . over the last several years , lattice groups , including ukqcd , have been using so - called _ improved _ versions of the lattice action which have lattice errors of @xmath17 . while this is an obvious improvement over conventional lattice actions , it does not preclude lattice results being contaminated with lattice artefacts , all - be - it at the @xmath17 level .    in order to establish a clean signal for many studies",
    "it is imperative to fix @xmath18 _ const _ for two reasons : ( i ) as seen above , the lattice calculation leaves the answer correct to @xmath17 , so in order to keep this error fixed , @xmath14 must obviously be fixed ; ( ii ) in order to maintain fixed finite - size effects , @xmath14 must be fixed ( simply because the lattice size @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of lattice sites along a side ) .",
    "thus , considering that @xmath15 ( see above ) the requirement that @xmath18 _ const _ defines a trajectory in the @xmath21 plane .",
    "in the previous section we argued that simulating along a fixed @xmath14 trajectory in @xmath21 parameter space lead to the cleanist study .",
    "ukqcd have followed this philosophy and performed simulations at four different parameter choices for @xmath21 such that @xmath18 _ const _",
    "@xmath22 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "note that one of these four parameter choices corresponds to the quenched approximation ( specifically @xmath23 ) .",
    "it is important to note that when a physical quantity changes value between these four parameter values , the cause can be attributed to variations in the quark mass @xmath10 ( i.e. `` unquenching '' effects ) , and _ not _ lattice systematics such as finite volume effects ( see previous section ) .    in this section an overview of three quantities of particular interest is given .",
    "one of the fundamental quantities that can be studied on the lattice is @xmath24 , the potential between two infinitely heavy quarks ( the `` static quark potential '' ) .",
    "phenomenologically , @xmath25 in figure 1 , @xmath24 is plotted for all four parameter choices .",
    "the phenomenological model eq.([eq : statpot ] ) is also shown .",
    "as can be seen there is agreement amongst the data and eq.([eq : statpot ] ) to a high precision .",
    "however , close inspection of the data near the origin shows a systematic tendency towards a higher value of @xmath26 as the quark mass @xmath10 is decreased towards it physical value .",
    "we take this as a signal for unquenching effects @xcite .",
    "figure 1 : _",
    "static quark potential versus distance @xmath27 on left , and hadronic masses @xmath28 versus @xmath29 on right .",
    "all quantities have been scaled by the distance scale @xmath30 . _      in this subsection the hadronic spectrum is discussed .",
    "we concentrate here on the pseudoscalar and vector mesonic states whose masses are denoted @xmath28 and @xmath31 respectively , since these can be determined most unambiguously . theoretically we expect the following relationship to hold : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are constants . in figure 1 , @xmath28 is plotted against @xmath29 for all four parameter choices .",
    "note that within each parameter choice , the `` valence '' quark mass is still a free parameter hence the multiple data points for each parameter choice in the figure @xcite . also plotted in figure 1 is the experimental values for the @xmath35 and @xmath36 mesons @xcite .",
    "as can be seen there is a trend towards the experimental values as the quenched approximation is removed .",
    "the topological susceptibility , @xmath37 , plotted in figure 2 , shows a marked unquenching effect .",
    "this is interpreted as a suppression of instanton effects by the light quark modes @xcite .",
    "of the three quantities discussed in this section , @xmath37 shows by far the most significant unquenching features .",
    "[ fig : top ]    figure 2 : _ topological susceptibility , @xmath37 , versus ( effective ) quark mass .",
    "all quantities have been scaled by the distance scale @xmath30 . _",
    "the 2-point function , @xmath4 can be spectrally decomposed @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the kernel ( it is @xmath40 in our case - see eq([eq : decompo ] ) ) and @xmath41 is the spectral function .",
    "@xmath41 contains information about the ground and excited states and the continuum for the particular channel of interest .    in @xcite",
    "the `` maximum entropy method '' which is based on bayesian statistics was employed to extract @xmath41 directly from the lattice @xmath4 data .",
    "this is an exciting development which we plan to implement since a huge wealth of information becomes available once @xmath41 is calculated .",
    "this is especially true in qcd in the high temperature phase where many channels no longer have bound states , and the traditional approach ( detailed in section 2 ) is simply not applicable .",
    "the ukqcd collaboration have made important progress in lattice qcd by implementing a `` matched '' trajectory approach where the lattice spacing is kept fixed , and thus the unquenching , finite - size and discretisation effects are dis - entangled .",
    "a summary is given here of the results for the static quark potential , hadronic spectrum and topological susceptibility - see @xcite for full details . a new and very promising method which enables the direct extraction of the spectral function from lattice data",
    "is discussed .",
