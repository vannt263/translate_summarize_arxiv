    "this paper revisits the assumptions and investigates their consequences to fundamental physics .",
    "the paper is organized into four parts .",
    "first , the derivations of the limits are reviewed and the assumptions fully interpreted .",
    "next , the behavior predicted from the limits is compared with theoretical calculations and experimental measurements of the nonlinear susceptibility .",
    "the third section demonstrates how the theory of the fundamental limits changes when the assumptions are relaxed , and their implications discussed .",
    "finally , the last section describes hints of potentially new fundamental physics that lies just beyond our horizon of understanding .",
    "the fundamental limits are calculated in three straightforward steps . first , the sum - over - states expressions of orr and ward@xcite for the nonlinear susceptibilities are simplified using the generized thomas - reiche - kuhn sum rules  which relate the position operator matrix elements , @xmath6 , and energies , @xmath7 , to each other , @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 index the energy eigenstates , and @xmath12 the number of electrons .",
    "then , the three - level ansatz is applied under the assumption that a three - level model accurately describes any system with a nonlinear - optical response near the fundamental limit .",
    "this leads to an expression with only two adjustable parameters , the ratio between the energies of the two states , @xmath13 , and the matrix element of the position operator , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the upper bound of @xmath16 , and it is determined from sum rules .",
    "finally , the expression for the nonlinear susceptibility is optimized under the assumption that @xmath17 and @xmath18 are independent .",
    "the process can be reversed , with the 3-level ansatz being applied prior to the sum rules , as we outline below .",
    "first , we reiterate the definition of the three - level ansatz ( tla ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ when the hyperpolarizability of a quantum system is at its fundamental limit , only three states contribute to the nonlinear response .",

    "the three - level ansatz is motivated by the simpler calculation of the off - resonance polarizability , given by , @xmath19 using eq .",
    "( [ sumrules ] ) with m = p=0 , @xmath20 an alternative method for getting eq .",
    "( [ polarizabilitymax ] ) is to note that eq .",
    "( [ polarizability ] ) is a sum of positive definite terms .",
    "if the full transition strength is placed in state 1 , the sum rules predict that all other transition moments @xmath21 vanish .",
    "thus , since the numerator is made maximum by placing all the transition strength between states 0 and 1 , and this denominator is the smallest of all terms , then @xmath22 is maximum in a two - level model .    consequently , one might expect that the same may be true for @xmath0 ; but , two problems arise .",
    "first , since the sum over states expression does not have all positive - definite terms , it is not a simple task to show that placing all the transition strength in the first excited state is the best strategy .",
    "a more damning problem is that the sum rule for the two - level model with @xmath23 and @xmath24 yields @xmath25 which does not allow both @xmath16 and @xmath26 to be nonzero . since in the two - level model , @xmath27 ,",
    "the implication is that @xmath28 for a two - level system  clearly not a maximum .",
    "however , no such problems arise for the three - level model . since using the minimum possible number of states makes the transition strengths of the non - vanishing terms large , and if the transition energies are small  that is , the lowest energy states are the dominant ones , then the three - level model will yield the largest nonlinear response .",
    "optimization of this expression by varying the independent physical quantities is then assumed to lead to the fundamental limit .",
    "since this sum rule derivation of limits appears to hold for all measurements and all exact analytical calculations , the three - level approximation for an optimized system appears reasonable .",
    "indeed , the highly successful two - level model , used in understating the nonlinear response of large numbers of donor / acceptor molecules by hundreds of researchers,@xcite has not been questioned because of its success despite the fact that such an expression violates the sum rules .",
    "the two - level model may work well for molecules with a hyperpolarizability far from the fundamental limit , where many states contribute but two dominate the response , perhaps due to slight resonance enhancement .",
    "in contrast , when the two - level model is constrained to obey the sum rules and forcing only two states to contribute while suppressing all others , the two - level model becomes unphysical .",
    "applying the sum rules to a three - level model yields its own set of problems .",
    "one can show that the truncation of the sum rules is perfectly legitimate when applied to a few - state sum - over - states ( sos ) expression of the hyperpolarizability in the manner used in calculating the limits.@xcite the problem arises in the choice of sum rules used in simplifying the sos expression .",
    "for example , in a three - level model , the largest state index is 2 and the sum rule corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ sumrules ] ) with @xmath29 ( call this sum rule @xmath30 ) is nonsensical and yields the obviously nonsensical result that , @xmath31 that is , a negative number equals a positive one .    in calculating the limits ,",
    "the sum rule equation @xmath30 is ignored . using the sum rules @xmath32",
    ", @xmath33 and @xmath34 reduces the three - level approximation of the sos expression to one with two adjustable parameter that are varied to find the maximum .",
    "the assumption here is that all nonlinear - optical susceptibilities near the limit can be approximated using this two - parameter model .",
    "the above approach ignores sum rule @xmath35 .",
    "one may argue that this choice is arbitrary , as did champagne and kirtman.@xcite for example , why not also ignore sum rule @xmath34 . with this choice , there would be no upper bound on the hyperpolarizability . in the end ,",
    "the appropriate choice is the one that is consistent with the data .",
    "potential optimization studies,@xcite nuclear placement,@xcite application of electromagnetic fields,@xcite and interactions between electrons in a potential well@xcite all show maximum hyperpolarizabilities of @xmath36 and @xmath37.@xcite using fewer sum rule equations makes the upper bound infinite while additional constraints decreases the limit below these values .",
    "thus , while not a rigorous proof , these observations show that the approximations used in calculating the limit are reasonable .    in summary ,",
    "the calculations of the fundamental limits uses the three - level anzatz , which has not been rigourously derived , but appears to hold over a broad set of observations . similarly , using the sum rules @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and ignoring the others is somewhat arbitrary but again yields the correct results .",
    "these assumptions are scrutinized and their implications discussed below .",
    "the tla and the neglect of the pathological sum rules are the two untested assumptions of the theory of limits .",
    "since they can not be tested directly , and proof with analytical techniques has been unsuccessful , an indirect approach is to sample a large enough domain of the full configuration space of quantum systems to determine if any of the predictions of the theory are violated .",
    "are there instances where a system beats the limits ?",
    "do all system fall substantially short of the limit ?",
    "how many states are typically involved near the limits ?",
    "these and related questions can be answered using analytical calculations and experimental data .    since the hyperpolarizability is not a scale - invariant quantity , we use the _ intrinsic hyperpolarizability _ , @xmath3 , as an absolute standard for evaluating a quantum system that is independent of the quantum unit s size,@xcite and spans the range @xmath38 $ ] with @xmath39 defining the fundamental limits .",
    "the factor of 30 gap between the largest nonlinearities observed ( prior to 2007 ) by experiment and the fundamental limits and the fact that the hyperpolarizability of the clipped harmonic oscillator is less than a factor of 2 smaller than the limit suggested that new paradigms for making better molecules and artificial quantum systems would be required to make larger intrinsic hyperpolarizabilities practical.@xcite more importantly , these studies established that the fundamental limits held for all known molecules and therefore represented the true upper bound .    to understand the nature of this gap , tripathy",
    "_ et al . _",
    "used linear spectroscopy , raman spectroscopy , @xmath0 values measured by hyper - rayleigh scattering and stark spectroscopy to determine which parameters are critical.@xcite included were tests of dilution effects due to vibronic states , investigations of unfavorable energy spacing of the molecule or atom , simplifications inherent in local field models , and an analysis of the effects of truncation of the sum rules .",
    "these studies concluded that the energy spectrum of real systems compared with the ideal is the most likely factor that keeps the hyperpolarizabilities of real molecules well below the limit.@xcite    to gain insights about the gap , the effects of several different parameters  including molecular geometry , external electromagnetic fields and electron - electron interactions  have been investigated .",
    "the effect of molecular geometry on the hyperpolarizability is determined by varying the positions and magnitudes of charges in 2-d and correlating them with dipolar charge asymmetry and the variations of angle between point charges in octupolar structures .",
    "it was shown that the best dipolar and octupole - like molecules have intrinsic hyperpolarizabilities near 0.7.@xcite    hamiltonians of the standard form , given by @xmath40 are used to calculate the sum rules .",
    "however , more general hamiltonians also obey the sum rules .",
    "for example , the first hyperpolarizability of molecules was studied in the presence of an external electromagnetic field modeled by a vector potential term added to the momentum , and also led to best intrinsic hyperpolarizabilities of about 0.7 even when the external field is comparable with internal molecular fields.@xcite thus , all real 1-electron systems modeled appear to have an upper bound of 0.709 .",
    "more recent work addresses the role of electron interactions on @xmath3@xcite and show that while @xmath0 for two non - interacting electrons are twice that of a single - electron system , since the fundamental limit for a two - electron system scales as @xmath41,@xcite increasing the number of electrons that do not interact with each other reduces @xmath3 . at best , the theory of fundamental limits predicts that interacting electrons will lead to @xmath41 scaling of the hyperpolarizability .",
    "calculations of two interacting electrons confirm this prediction , so the best values of @xmath3 for this system are again found to be about @xmath42.@xcite there is no reason to believe that adding additional electrons will lead to a larger _ intrinsic _ nonlinear response .",
    "other studies aimed at investigating the gap have used numerical optimization techniques to find the potential energy functions that maximize the hyperpolarizability . in this approach , many classes of starting potentials ( polynomial , trigonometric , etc . ) are varied until the hyperpolarizabilities are optimized using a finite - difference method to calculate @xmath0 using , @xmath43 where @xmath11 is dipole moment calculated in the presence of the applied electric field .",
    "these too find the largest @xmath3 values to be approximately 0.71.@xcite    atherton _",
    "used a different approach to optimize a piecewise linear potential function of the form @xmath44 for @xmath45 , with @xmath12 as the number of segments.@xcite they also find the universal value of optimized hyperpolarizability to be @xmath46.@xcite .",
    "the authors use a hessian matrix @xcite of @xmath3 to find the relevant parameters defining the hyperpolarizability and find that ( a ) two parameters suffice to find the appropriate potential function and b ) increasing the number of parameters does not improve upon the value of @xmath3 .",
    "a summary of the largest attainable @xmath3 vales are presented in table [ tab : betaint s ] .    in the above approaches ,",
    "the shrdinger equation is solved directly for many hamiltonians .",
    "all quantum systems with an intrinsic hyperpolarizability near the fundamental limit , independent of the underlying hamiltonian , are found to share universal properties : the three - level ansatz is obeyed ; the ratio of the second to first excited state energies is @xmath47 ; and , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the largest possible transition moment to the first excited state .",
    "it is intriguing that such a broad range of systems share the same properties , and the natural question is why .",
    "in addition to the fundamental questions that arise , universal properties can be used as a guide for optimizing the hyperpolarizability .",
    "a larger configuration space can be probed using the sum rules directly in lieu of the shrdinger equation . in this approach ,",
    "monte carlo simulations are used to generate a distribution of @xmath3 values based on millions of random samplings of the energies and transition moments under the constraint that the eigenenergies , @xmath7 , and transition moments , @xmath50 , obey the sum rules .",
    "the largest hyperpolarizabilities are found once again to be characterized by three dominant states ; but , the hyperpolarizabilities can approach arbitrarily closely to the limit.@xcite since the sum rules cover a broader domain than the shrdinger equation , it is not surprising that values greater than given by the shrdinger equation are found . however , none are larger than @xmath51 .",

    "the reason for this conflict may reside in the fact that sum rules permit energies and transition moments that are unphysical .",

    ", we propose that the maximum attainable hyperpolarizability is most likely given by , @xmath137",
    "the sum total of all measurements and calculations using hamiltonians leads to two observations : ( 1 ) the largest intrinsic hyperpolarizability is less than 0.709 ; and , ( 2 ) when a quantum system is found to have a hyperpolarizability in the vicinity of this maximum , only three states contribute .",
    "these two observations have never been proven , so it behooves us to ask whether or not these are indeed fundamental laws of physics , or a mere coincidence .",
    "the many - state catastrophe is an important part of the puzzle because it violates both these observations .",
    "this is not surprising nor a matter of concern given that wave functions that are solutions to standard hamiltonians give a range of dipole matrix elements and energies that are a subset of the dipole matrix elements and energies that obey the sum rules .    when computing limits and other fundamental relationships involving the quantum origin of optical nonlinearity , it is important to not lose sight of the fact that the hyperpolarizabilities are coefficients in an expansion of the dipole operator in terms of the applied electric field . as such , these quantities have no meaning when a power series expansion is not possible .",
    "the key point is that the hyperpolarizability is a quantity that is derived from perturbation theory .",
    "thus , any properties of a given system must be derived directly from the hamiltonian of the quantum system including the contribution from the perturbation of the photon field .",
    "auxiliary quantities , such as the sum rules , must clearly be obeyed ; but , as shown in this paper , may lead to behavior that is nonphysical if the properties of the hamiltonian are not also used to constrain the system .    in the calculation of the fundamental limits of the hyperpolarizability using the sum rules , an additional auxiliary condition is added - namely the three - level ansatz .",
    "the argument for its use is as follows .",
    "one can show rigorously and without approximation that a two - state model optimizes the polarizability , @xmath22 , in which the oscillator strength is placed into one excited state  avoiding dilution effects that arise from spreading oscillator strength between many higher - energy states .",

    "the three - state model has the minimum number of states that leads to a physically reasonable result , and is therefore used based on the dilution argument .",
    "while there is no rigorous proof that a three - state model yields a maximum , the approach is justified by the heuristic argument that a concentration of oscillator strength in a small number of low - energy states yields large numerators and small denominators in the sos expression , thus maximizing the hyperpolarizability . with more states ,",
    "the oscillator strength is distributed over many states , thus diluting the nonlinearity",
    ". however , the many - state catastrophe arises from a very specific highly - degenerate quantum system that spreads oscillator strength over many states of equal energy , thus preserving oscillator strength but without dilution because the degeneracy keeps all energy denominators small .    before arguing that the highly - degenerate spectrum is nonphysical , one other loose end needs to be addressed ",
    "the a priori assumption of the three - level ansatz and its potential role in being responsible for the observation that all quantum systems ever calculated obey it .",
    "there is clearly no causal connection between calculating the limits using tla and calculating @xmath0 for a specific hamiltonian .",
    "the three - level ansatz is used only in the calculations of the fundamental limits , and not in the analysis of the hyperpolarizabilities that are calculated from hamiltonians .",
    "thus , the observation that the three - level ansatz holds in all quantum systems tested is not tied to its assumption in the calculation of the limits .",
    "the calculation of the fundamental limits of the polarizability is made simple by the fact that each term in the sos expression is positive definite , and of the form , @xmath139 as we saw in eqs .",

    "the many - state catastrophe shows that using only the sum rules and not truncating the sos expression leads to a diverging result ; i.e. that there is no limit .",
    "this runs counter to the evidence .",
    "clearly , the correct approach is to apply the sum rules , and rather than truncating the sos expression , to use an additional constraint that is determined from the general form of the hamiltonian .",
