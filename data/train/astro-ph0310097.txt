    "@xcite , concluded that late - type spirals were better fitted by mildly elliptical disks ( @xmath9 ) than by perfectly circular disks . using a sample of 13,482 spiral galaxies",
    ", @xcite found that the ellipticity was reasonably well fitted by a gaussian peaking at @xmath10 : @xmath11 subject to the constraint @xmath12 .",
    "the best fit was given by @xmath13 , yielding an average ellipticity of @xmath14 .",
    "the nonaxisymmetry of disks , which is signaled by a scarcity of apparently circular galaxies , has been confirmed by other photometric studies @xcite .",
    "analyses which rely on the measured axis ratios of a large sample of galaxies have certain intrinsic shortcomings .",
    "first , they provide only a statistical statement about the distribution of disk ellipticities in the sample examined ; they do nt determine the axis ratio of any individual galaxy .",
    "moreover , since these studies rely purely on photometry , they provide information about the ellipticity of the starlight emitted by the galaxy .",
    "the ellipticity measured in this way is affected by bars , eccentric rings and pseudorings , loosely wound spiral arms , and patchy star formation , and does not necessarily reflect the overall ellipticity of the potential within which the stars are orbiting .",
    "these intrinsic shortcomings are avoided by methods using both photometric and kinematic information .",
    "consider a disk of test particles orbiting in a potential which is elliptical in the disk plane .",
    "the closed particle orbits , when the potential ellipticity is small , will be elliptical themselves @xcite .",
    "if the potential is logarithmic , producing a flat rotation curve , the ellipticity of the orbits will equal the ellipticity of the potential .",
    "if the resulting elliptical disk is seen in projection , the isophotal principal axes will be misaligned with the kinematic principal axes .",
    "( the kinematic principal axes can be defined as the axis along which the line - of - sight component of the rotation velocity is a maximum and the axis along which is is zero . ) because of the misalignment , there is generally a non - zero velocity gradient along the isophotal minor axis , proportional to @xmath15 , where @xmath6 is the ellipticity of the potential , and @xmath16 is the azimuthal viewing angle measured relative to the long axis of the potential @xcite . studying the velocity field of gas at large radii , where the dark matter should dominate the potential , typically yields @xmath17 @xcite .    by combining integral - field spectroscopy with imaging data",
    ", @xcite were able to determine the intrinsic ellipticity for a number of disk galaxies at low inclination .",
    "since the misalignment between the isophotal principal axes and the kinematic principal axes decreases as the inclination increases , the technique of @xcite can only be usefully applied to galaxies with inclination @xmath18 . for a sample of 28 spiral galaxies",
    ", @xcite found that the intrinsic ellipticities were well fitted by a log - normal distribution .",
    "the mean ellipticity of the galaxies in their sample was @xmath19 .",
    "the method of andersen and collaborators has its own shortcomings .",
    "the sample of galaxies is relatively small .",
    "systematic uncertainties in determining the isophotal and kinematic major axes can mask the signal produced by an elliptical disk @xcite .",
    "in addition , to ensure that their sample contained only galaxies with small inclination , @xcite and @xcite included only galaxies that appeared nearly circular , with @xmath20 .",
    "this selection bias discriminates against intrinsically highly elliptical disks , which have a relatively small probability of appearing nearly circular in projection .",
    "thus , the true distribution of ellipticities will have a higher mean ellipticity and a larger standard deviation than the andersen - bershady sample .    in this paper ,",
    "i combine information from the two types of analysis ; the photometry - only method , which has the advantage of large sample size , and the @xcite method , which has the advantage of including kinematic information which probes the potential more directly . in section  [ sdss",
    "] , i use the measured apparent axis ratios of @xmath21 galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey data release 1 to make an estimate of their intrinsic disk ellipticities . in section  [ andersen ] , i reanalyze the disk ellipticities found by @xcite , taking into account the selection bias , to find the underlying distribution of disk ellipticities .",

    "in addition , each candidate galaxy is fitted directly with the point - spread function , yielding @xmath39 , the likelihood associated with the psf fit .    to build a sample of disk galaxies from the sdss dr1 , i selected objects flagged as galaxies whose model fits in the @xmath24 band satisfied the criteria @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "in addition , each galaxy was required to have a spectroscopic redshift @xmath42 , to reduce the possibility of weak lensing distorting the observed shape , and @xmath43 , to eliminate a few contaminating foreground objects .",
    "the spectroscopic sample of the sdss dr1 contained 30,184 galaxies satisfying these criteria .",
    "note that i have selected galaxies on the basis of their surface brightness profile ( exponential rather than de vaucouleurs ) , and not on other criteria such as color or isophote shape .",
    "it is generally true , though , that bright early - type galaxies ( elliptical and s0 ) are better fitted by de vaucouleurs profiles than by exponential profiles , and that spiral galaxies are better fitted by exponential profiles @xcite .",
    "moreover , the spectroscopic sample of the dr1 contains galaxies which are too high in surface brightness to be dwarf ellipticals , which can also have exponential surface brightness profiles @xcite .",
    "thus , i will assume that the galaxies which i have chosen on the basis of their exponential profiles are disk - dominated spiral galaxies .",
    "the model fits to the exponential galaxies provide one measure of the axis ratio @xmath7 .",
    "however , a model with constant position angle @xmath44 and axis ratio @xmath7 is not a good approximation to a real spiral galaxy .",
    "fortunately , the sdss dr1 photometric analysis also provides more robust , model - free measures of the axis ratio .",
    "one useful shape measure is @xmath45 , the axis ratio determined by the use of adaptive moments . in general",
    ", the technique of adaptive moments determines the @xmath46th order moments of an image using an elliptical weight function whose shape matches that of the object @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the sdss adaptive moments use a gaussian weight function @xmath47 which is matched to the size and ellipticity of the galaxy image @xmath48 . with the weight function @xmath47 known ,",
    "the moments can be calculated : @xmath49 @xmath50 and so forth .",
    "the sdss dr1 provides for each image the adaptive second moments @xmath51 @xmath52 and @xmath53 the adaptive second moments can be converted into an axis ratio using the relation @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "the adaptive moments axis ratio computed in this way are not corrected for the effects of seeing .",
    "however , the sdss dr1 also provides the adaptive second moments , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , for the point spread function at the location of the image .",
    "these moments can be used to correct for the smearing and shearing due to seeing ; such corrections are vital in studying the small shape changes resulting from weak lensing @xcite .",
    "however , to eliminate the need for corrections , i will only retain galaxies which are well resolved , with @xmath59 .",
    "of the five bands used by sdss , the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath0 bands provide useful morphological information ; the low detector sensitivity at @xmath22 and @xmath25 and the high background at @xmath25 make them less useful for study . at @xmath23 , @xmath60",
    "galaxies satisfy my criteria , at @xmath24 , the number is @xmath61 , and at @xmath0 , it s @xmath62 .",
    "because the weight function @xmath47 is scaled to the size of the galaxy image , the adaptive moments axis ratio @xmath45 can be thought of as an average axis ratio to which the outer regions of the galaxy , beyond the effective radius , do not contribute significantly .",

    "by contrast , the approach of @xcite and @xcite uses both photometric and kinematic information to find the ellipticity of individual disks .",
