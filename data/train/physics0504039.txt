    "atomic physics and quantum optics currently discover the fascinating field of mesoscopic physics @xcite .",
    "mesoscopic phenomena are due to interference effects that survive a disorder average in phase - coherent samples .",
    "interference effects can be observed using both genuine quantum matter waves such as electrons or ultra - cold atoms and classical waves such as acoustic or electromagnetic waves @xcite . arguably , the most dramatic effect is the breakdown of diffusive transport due to strong localization , a phenomenon invoked by anderson in the context of the metal - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "strong localisation has been observed unambiguously for electrons @xcite and microwaves @xcite in quasi - one - dimensional systems . yet even in dilute samples far from the dense regime",
    "where strong localisation could be expected , interference effects can be measured . in optics ,",
    "a rather robust interference phenomenon is the coherent backscattering ( cbs ) effect . here",
    ", the constructive interference between waves counterpropagating along a given multiple scattering path enhances the average diffuse intensity reflected from an ensemble of random samples in a narrow angular range around the backscattering direction @xcite . under optimal experimental conditions allowing to apply the reciprocity theorem @xcite",
    ", this two - wave interference enhances the intensity exactly by a factor of 2 @xcite .",
    "quantum optical systems involving multiple scattering of photons by atoms are well adapted to study general concepts of quantum transport .",
    "indeed , atoms are very efficient point scatterers for light because the scattering cross section close to an internal resonance is huge compared to the actual atomic size .",
    "laser - cooling techniques permit one to prepare low temperature clouds where a negligible doppler broadening of atomic transitions preserves the phase coherence of the propagating photons . for low enough laser intensity",
    ", photons are scattered completely elastically from closed atomic dipole transitions such that inelastic scattering and absorption are absent ( see , however , @xcite for saturation effects at higher field intensities ) .",
    "furthermore , by injecting and detecting well - defined photon polarization states , one is capable of probing the internal spin degrees of freedom of the atomic scatterers .    the experimental observation of cbs of laser light by cold atoms @xcite has revealed the crucial impact of the internal atomic structure onto coherent photon transport .",
    "atomic dipole transitions with a nondegenerate ground - state scatter photons like isotropic point - dipoles ( also known as rayleigh scatterers ) @xcite . in general , however , photons probe dipole transitions with rather high zeeman degeneracy due to large total angular momentum .",
    "it was shown theoretically that an average over all possible angular momentum orientations then leads to an antisymmetric component of the atomic scattering tensor which reduces the interference contrast of coherent backscattering considerably @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the absence of an external magnetic field , photons are scattered elastically by freely orientable atomic dipoles just like electrons propagating in a sample of magnetic impurities ( spin - flip scattering ) , and in this case interference corrections to the diffusive transport picture are cut off very efficiently @xcite .",
    "previous analytical studies of the cbs double scattering contribution _ from _ an infinite atomic medium @xcite as well as the case of multiple scattering _ inside _ an infinite medium @xcite treated an arbitrary single , isolated , degenerate atomic dipole transition .",
    "this description is _ a priori _ accurate if the hyperfine optical resonance under consideration is sufficiently far away from neighboring transitions and if the laser detuning is sufficiently small .",
    "however , kupriyanov and co - workers @xcite showed that the cbs enhancement factor displays a slight asymmetry as function of the probe frequency around the resonance that can only be accounted for by including the other optical hyperfine transitions . in the framework of their purely numerical calculation",
    ", they did not give a qualitative explanation for the fact that the largest asymmetry is observed in the @xmath0 polarization channel of preserved helicity and that the higher enhancement is found towards the blue - detuned side of the transition .",
    "extending our previous results , we develop in the present contribution an analytical theory for multiple photon scattering from atoms with a uniform statistical distribution over the magnetic quantum numbers inside each hyperfine level of the ground state , leaving the possibility of an arbitrary population distribution of the various hyperfine levels ( for example a thermal one ) .",
    "we rely on the decomposition of the scattered intensity into irreducible components with respect to the rotation group .",
    "this method has been developed some time ago in atomic physics @xcite , but only today , with the advent of laser cooling techniques , we can study subtle interference effects for the multiple coherent scattering of quasimonochromatic radiation .",
    "as an application , we calculate the cbs enhancement factor as a function of probe frequency for scattering from an infinite half - space .",
    "this choice is not meant to describe a realistic experiment but minimizes the purely geometrical effects of a finite optical thickness that varies with the scattering mean - free path .",
    "our approach explains sign and magnitude of the asymmetry observed in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our theory permits to describe precisely how the effective degeneracy can be reduced by tuning far from hyperfine - structure or fine - structure multiplets .",
    "this allows us to understand how more complicated objects such as molecules or clusters , that involve more and more transitions , eventually scatter light as classical objects with an optimal interference contrast .",
    "therefore , we are able to bridge the gap towards effective theories for mesoscopic photon physics in systems with classical scatterers @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ theory.sec ] , we develop the general theory of multiple photon scattering by hyperfine multiplets in the independent scattering approximation . in sec",

    "we describe the photon field for weak laser intensity by one - photon fock states @xmath16 with wave vector @xmath17 and transverse polarization @xmath18 . in units where @xmath19 , the energy or angular frequency of this state is @xmath20 .",
    "the scattering of these one - photon states by atomic dipole transitions will be described following the lines of @xcite while generalizing to multilevel transitions .",
    "we consider atoms at rest which are initially prepared in an electronic ground - state with angular momentum @xmath21 , but possibly in any sublevel @xmath22 of the corresponding hyperfine multiplet .",
    "the probe light frequency is near - resonant with an electric dipole transition connecting the electronic ground - state @xmath21 to an electronic excited state @xmath23 .",
    "we assume here that the atom fine structure is well described by an @xmath24-coupling scheme ( fig .",
    "[ multiplet.fig ] ) , where the total electronic angular momentum @xmath25 couples to the nuclear spin @xmath11 , producing a hyperfine multiplet @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "the energy splitting of each hyperfine multiplet then is much smaller than the fine structure splitting .",
    "this is the typical situation in alkali atoms like rubidium : for the d2 line ( @xmath28 ) of the rb@xmath29 isotope with nuclear spin @xmath30 , the ground - state @xmath7 is split into two levels with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "similarly , the excited state @xmath8 is split into @xmath33 . in this scheme ,",
    "the effect of different far off - resonance fine - structure transitions @xmath34 with the same hyperfine quantum numbers @xmath35 is neglected .",
    "other coupling cases could be easily treated along the lines of reasoning described in the present paper . in general ,",
    "several optical transitions @xmath36 between the ground - state and the excited state hyperfine multiplets are allowed .",
    "we will assume that the @xmath37 transition is _ closed _ so that , after having scattered an incoming photon , the atom returns to the same ground - state hyperfine multiplet but possibly in a different hyperfine level ( this is the case for the rb d2 line ) .    the hamiltonian of this internal atomic structure with ground and excited levels @xmath38 and @xmath39 is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the energy of the atomic level with angular momentum @xmath42 . @xmath43 is the projector onto that level , @xmath44 with a similar expression for the projector @xmath45 onto excited levels with angular momentum @xmath14 . throughout the paper ,",
    "the following convention holds : primed symbols like @xmath14 refer to the excited state multiplet whereas unprimed symbols like @xmath13 refer to the ground - state multiplet .",
    "while scattering a single photon @xmath46 , the atom undergoes a transition @xmath47 from an initial to a final hyperfine level .",
    "the corresponding scattering amplitude @xmath48 is a matrix element of the scattering operator @xmath49 acting on internal atomic states and polarization vectors . according to fundamental rules of quantum theory",
    ", the amplitudes for all indistinguishable scattering processes via intermediate excited states @xmath39 have to be added coherently : @xmath50 the cartesian components of the scattering operator for the partial scattering process @xmath51 are @xcite @xmath52 here @xmath53 is the electronic dipole operator with components @xmath54 . because of energy conservation the final photon frequency is @xmath55 .",
    "the scattering is elastic when @xmath56 , i.e. , when the initial and final state have the same energy @xmath57 .",
    "it is inelastic in all other instances .",
    "the decay rate @xmath58 of each excited level is the sum of spontaneous decay rates to all accessible final ground - states @xmath59 : @xmath60 for atoms used in cold atom experiments such as alkali or alkaline earth atoms , the hyperfine splitting is much smaller than @xmath61 such that the frequency difference between the various hyperfine transitions can be safely ignored for the evaluation of @xmath58 , which is then a constant , the natural linewidth @xmath62 .",
    "note however that this approximation can easily be relaxed : in the formulas below describing interference effects between various hyperfine components , such as eq .",
    "( [ skomega_gf.eq ] ) , one would have to use the frequency - dependent @xmath58 .",
    "since the dipole operator @xmath53 acts only on the electronic angular momentum @xmath63 , and not on the nuclear spin @xmath64 , the reduced matrix element can then be reduced even further @xcite : @xmath65 the @xmath66-symbol describes the recoupling of the 4 angular momenta @xmath67 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath68 for the vector operator @xmath53 .",
    "the sum over the final hyperfine levels @xmath59 in then can be done using a @xmath66-symbol normalization rule such that one finds a uniform width for all excited hyperfine levels , @xmath69    here , we introduce the reduced fine structure matrix element @xmath70 . for further use , we define the dimensionless dipole operator @xmath71 between the levels @xmath72 and @xmath13 with detuning @xmath73 finally , the scattering operator takes the form @xmath74 the prefactor contains the free photon spectral density @xmath75 for a given polarization in a quantization volume @xmath76 .",
    "multiple scattering in the dilute regime can be depicted as a succession of scattering events by single atoms connected by propagation in an effective medium .",
    "an effective photon transport theory is obtained by a configuration average over atomic degrees of freedom .",
    "the atoms are assumed to be initially prepared independently in the ground - state levels @xmath13 with probabilities @xmath77 .",
    "these probabilities can represent an equilibrium distribution at a certain temperature or situations where hyperfine pumping has been achieved . inside each level , we assume a uniform statistical distribution over magnetic quantum numbers @xmath78 .",
    "accordingly , the one - atom density matrix of internal degrees of freedom reads @xmath79 the assumption of a scalar @xmath80 is reasonable for optically thick samples , where the isotropization by multiply scattered photons dominates possible optical pumping effects due to the incident laser .",
    "needless to say , this assumption greatly simplifies the calculation .",
    "in essence , an entirely analytical description is only manageable because the average over an isotropic distribution like restores rotational invariance .",
    "the wave vector @xmath81 of a photon with frequency @xmath61 in the dilute atomic medium is determined by the dispersion relation @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the refractive index . in scattering media",
    ", the refractive index has an imaginary part that reflects the fact that scattering depletes the propagating average photon field .",
    "this defines the scattering mean free path @xmath84 .",
    "technically , the scattering mean free path is calculated via the photon self - energy , which in turn is proportional to the scattering operator averaged over the atomic density matrix @xcite . carrying out the isotropic sum over @xmath85 , one finds @xmath86 here , @xmath87 is the number density of atoms .",
    "the sum over the ground - state levels @xmath38 is due to the simple atomic distribution .",
    "the sum over the excited levels @xmath39 is due to the linear superposition of scattering amplitudes , and the lorentzian frequency dependence comes from taking the imaginary part of the resonant denominators in .",
    "the atomic level structure enters via the coefficients @xmath88 , a short - hand notation for the @xmath66-symbols @xmath89 that stem from the decomposition .",
    "thanks to the @xmath66-symbol normalization , they obey the following sum rules  @xcite :    [ summegsq.eq ] @xmath90    energy conservation dictates that extinction of the forward propagating mode is related to the total scattering cross - section @xmath91 by the relation @xmath92 .",
    "this relation , the optical theorem in a multiple scattering disguise , will be proved in the following subsection .",
    "we can use it here to write the total scattering cross - section as @xmath93 this total cross section is a weighted sum of lorentzians of uniform width for all possible transitions @xmath94 . note that this result pertains to scattering from a single hyperfine multiplet in both the ground and the excited states , i.e. , a single fine - structure transition @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , we consider a single dipole transition with a single principal quantum number in the excited state such that no interference effects between different fine - structure transitions or different dipole transitions with the same angular momentum ( as considered in @xcite ) can appear in the total cross section .    since the total cross section measures the total depletion of the initial photon state , it includes both elastic scattering events where the final atomic level @xmath95 is identical to the initial level @xmath38 , but also inelastic scattering where the internal energy of the atom is changed .",
    "a separate evaluation of elastic and inelastic scattering is possible by considering the differential cross section .      in the weak scattering approximation ,",
    "the building block of multiple scattering is the average differential cross section for scattering polarized photons @xmath96 while the atom undergoes a transitions @xmath97 .",
    "the differential cross - section is obtained by averaging the square of the scattering operator over the atomic density matrix , giving the well - known kramers - heisenberg formula @xcite .",
    "when all scattering processes without final frequency analysis are considered , it can be written in the form @xmath98 here , the total cross section @xmath91 has been factorized such that the dimensionless atomic vertex funtion @xmath99 contains all angular information about light polarization and internal atomic structure .",
    "this vertex function has been calculated in @xcite for the case of a single isolated resonance @xmath37 using the techniques of irreducible tensor operators . since we still assume a _",
    "scalar _ density matrix , the vertex function must still be the sum of all possible scalar products of its vector arguments , @xmath100 as in @xcite , the weights are given by the combinations @xmath101 of coefficients @xmath102 that describe scalar @xmath103 , antisymmetric @xmath104 , and symmetric @xmath105 scattering .",
    "for the present case of multiple resonances , these coefficients are now frequency dependent : @xmath106 where each transition @xmath107 is described by @xmath108 the structure of these expressions reflects well - known rules of quantum theory : the total transition probability is the weighted incoherent sum over initial states @xmath38 with occupation probability @xmath77 , and the incoherent sum over distinguishable final states @xmath95 , but the square of the coherent sum of all indistinguishable amplitudes , here related to the intermediate excited levels @xmath39 .",
    "the atomic level structure enters via the coefficients @xmath88 and @xmath109 defined in .",
    "the essential information about the irreducible tensor modes @xmath110 of the scattering operator is contained in the factors @xmath111 the coefficients @xmath112 , together with the scattering mean free path , are the basic ingredients for computing multiple scattering quantities .",
    "the derivation of expressions - constitutes the main achievement of the present work . from this point on",
    ", we will essentially explore its consequences .",
    "the total cross section can be calculated from by a sum over all final photon polarization vectors @xmath113 and an angular integration over the scattered photon s direction @xmath114 .",
    "this operation on the vertex function yields @xmath115 .",
    "the weights have been defined such that they obey the sum rule @xcite @xmath116 which is equivalent to @xmath117 this last relation can be deduced from by virtue of @xmath66-symbol orthogonality  @xcite and the sum rule . in a more general setting , this relation is shown to be a trace - conservation property of the intensity scattering vertex @xcite . with this , we indeed recover the total cross section and thus prove the optical theorem @xmath118 that was used above to derive the total scattering cross section directly from the mean free path .",
    "note that the interference between scattering amplitudes via different excited states @xmath39 , present in , disappears in the total cross section .",
    "this is a result of the complete statistical average over the degenerate ground - state . on the elementary level of clebsch - gordan coefficients",
    ", the somewhat abstract @xmath66-symbol orthogonality appears as a complete cancellation of interference terms from equiprobable ground - states for large detuning .",
    "expression of the differential cross - section coefficients permits to distinguish between elastic scattering events with @xmath119 and inelastic scattering events with @xmath120 such that we are able to write @xmath121 where each transition @xmath107 is described by its coefficients @xmath112 defined in . by integrating over final polarization and scattering directions ,",
    "we can therefore write @xmath122 with the total cross section for each elementary transition @xmath123 , @xmath124 by separating elastic from inelastic contributions , we therefore find @xmath125 with @xmath126 in principle , a frequency analysis of the scattered photons makes it possible to measure elastic and inelastic contributions independently .",
    "note , however , that all elastic components from the various initial states @xmath38 are at the same frequency and can not be distinguished by a frequency analysis .",
    "elastic scattering is of course desirable for coherent multiple scattering since the scattered photons stay on resonance .",
    "therefore , previous experiments of coherent backscattering from degenerate atomic dipole transitions have been performed on various isolated hyperfine transitions @xmath127 that are closed ( see @xcite for a comprehensive list ) . or rather , these transitions are very nearly closed : a small rate of inelastic scattering persists because after excitation to an off - resonant hyperfine level , inelastic transitions are possible , for example the process @xmath128 is the case of the much - studied transition @xmath129 of rb@xmath29 . detuning away from the closed resonance towards the other resonances of course increases the inelastic scattering rate .",
    "a completely consistent theory of scattering from hyperfine multiplets therefore needs to take into account inelastic scattering , without which predictions about cbs enhancement factors close to open transitions are questionable @xcite .",
    "inelastic scattering can be incorporated in monte carlo simulations of photon trajectories but is beyond the scope of the present article , devoted to analytical results . in sec .",
    "[ elastic.sec ] , we will therefore specialize to the interesting case where hyperfine multiplets are simultaneously excited from a unique ground state which assures purely elastic scattering .",
    "the complicated radiation pattern described by eq .",
    "( [ vertexfunction.eq ] ) is generally not the one of a classical point - dipole scatterer .",
    "but for an isotropic atomic transition @xmath130 , there is only a single nondegenerate ground state and a single threefold degenerate excited state .",
    "in such a case , the weights coefficients in   are simply @xmath131 and the atom scatters light like a classical point - dipole or rayleigh scatterer with @xmath132 this is equivalent to the quasiclassical model of an elastically bound electron . in this case interference effects in multiple scattering",
    "are fully preserved and the cbs enhancement factor achieves its maximal value @xmath133 in the helicity - preserving channel @xcite .",
    "in optics , scattering of light  including interference effects like cbs  by small particles ( smaller than the wavelength of light ) is often successfully described by modelling the small particles as classical point - dipole scatterers .",
    "however , such classical particles are very unlikely to be in a pure @xmath134 state , and we know that atoms in @xmath135 states show very low cbs interference in all polarization channels @xcite . therefore , the validity of the classical point - scatterer model for complex objects with possibly many internal resonances is rather surprising . in this section ,",
    "we therefore show how `` classical '' coherent backscattering properties are recovered for complex quantum objects ( like atoms , molecules , or clusters ) using a time - scale argument together with the analytical formulation developed above .",
    "in other words , we close the gap between the microscopic theory for atoms and effective models for classical scatterers .",
    "the fact that hyperfine and fine structures affect the angular distribution of the scattered light has been recognized and understood for quite some time  @xcite . in order to grasp how coherent",
    "light scattering depends on the hyperfine structure ( or fine structure ) multiplets and the detuning from resonance , it is useful to consider the various time scales coming into play .",
    "since @xmath22 is a good quantum number , the semiclassical picture of hyperfine structure is that both the nuclear spin @xmath11 and the electronic angular momentum @xmath6 precess around their constant sum @xmath136 .",
    "it follows that the atomic electric dipole precesses after being excited by the incoming laser field .",
    "if the laser source is very monochromatic  linewidth smaller than the classical precession frequency , i.e. , temporal coherence longer than the precession period  the radiated field is built by a coherent superposition of radiating dipoles with various spatial orientations .",
    "the net result of this coherent superposition , calculated using quantum theory of angular momenta , is the unusual radiation pattern .",
    "there are , however , two complications : first , the atomic dipole decays because of spontaneous emission over the time @xmath137 second , if the excitation is not exactly resonant , it also oscillates at a frequency equal to the detuning @xmath138 from resonance .",
    "these two effects are properly understood by considering the scattering of a quasimonochromatic wave packet formed by superposition of different neighboring frequencies around a central frequency @xmath61 .",
    "such a wave packet is not scattered instantaneously , but after some delay @xmath139 , known as the wigner time delay .",
    "it is given by the derivative of the scattering phase shift @xmath140see with respect to frequency : @xmath141 the wigner time delay is the time scale after which the atomic dipole induced by the incoming electromagnetic field ceases to radiate coherently .",
    "it is maximum at resonance where it is twice the lifetime of the atomic excited state , and decays towards zero away from resonance .    if the wigner time delay @xmath139 is longer than the period of hyperfine precession @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the typical hyperfine splitting , then the radiating dipole precesses during its coherence time , thus giving rise to a specific radiation pattern",
    "this is the case at resonance if the linewidth @xmath62 is smaller than the hyperfine splitting @xmath143 , a situation usually encountered for an isolated hyperfine component .",
    "by contrast , if the wigner time delay @xmath139 is shorter than the period of hyperfine precession @xmath144 , then one expects the radiating dipole to be spatially frozen during its coherence time .",
    "consequently , the radiation pattern should turn into the one associated with a classical dipole .",
    "there are two obvious ways of reaching the classical scattering situation @xmath145 . on the one hand , if the spontaneous decay rate is larger than the hyperfine splitting , @xmath146 , the various components of the hyperfine multiplet are not resolved .",
    "the degree of freedom associated with the nuclear spin and its interaction with the electron are completely quenched on the radiative decay time scale and can be forgotten , whatever the detuning from resonance . on the other hand ,",
    "when the resonances are well separated , @xmath147 , one can use large detuning to bring the wigner time delay below the hyperfine precession period . by detuning far away from the entire multiplet of hyperfine resonances",
    ", the excitation then no longer probes the nuclear spin , and therefore scattering is only sensitive to the fine structure .      the full analytical theory developed in sec .",
    "[ theory.sec ] permits one to follow precisely how the different resonance contributions combine to yield classical scattering characteristics for large detuning . when the wigner time delay is shorter than the hyperfine period , all resonant denominators @xmath148 can be taken equal to a common value @xmath149 where @xmath150 is now the detuning from the fine - structure resonance line @xmath37 ( cf .",
    "[ multiplet.fig ] ) . in expression",
    ", the resonant denominator can thus be factorized from the sum over excited states @xmath39 . the sum rule",
    "together with the normalization @xmath151 can then be used to obtain the effective fine - structure cross section @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the ratio of multiplicities normalized to @xmath154 .",
    "the cross section is now independent of the hyperfine structure , i.e. , no longer depends on the nuclear spin @xmath67 and the population @xmath77 of the various hyperfine levels .",
    "similar arguments apply to the scattering of broadband radiation by thermal atoms ( see especially sec .",
    "3.4.2 .  of @xcite ) .",
    "the radiation pattern of the scattered photons is subject to the same transformation : the frequency - dependent denominator can be factorized from the sum over @xmath39 in ( [ skomega.eq ] ) . for large enough detuning , the atomic medium makes no difference between photons scattered elastically or inelastically , such that all contributions of final states @xmath95 must be added .",
    "the resulting sum involves the product of three @xmath66 coefficients which can be computed using the biedenharn - elliott sum rule  @xcite and everything boils down to the coefficients calculated in @xcite : @xmath155 the differential cross section then is still given by , its only frequency dependence being the single lorentzian resonance of the total cross section .",
    "the very same arguments apply to the electron spin responsible for the atomic fine structure .",
    "indeed , the coupling of the electronic orbital angular momentum @xmath3 with the optically inactive electronic spin @xmath1 produces the total electronic angular momentum @xmath156 .",
    "again , when the spontaneous decay rate @xmath62 is larger than the fine - structure splitting ( meaning that the various components of the fine - structure multiplet are not resolved ) , or when the laser frequency is far detuned from the fine - structure multiplet such that one has to sum over all possible excited levels @xmath157 , one recovers the case of a @xmath158 transition , where only the orbital properties ( directly related to the charge density response to the laser excitation ) of the electrons play a role .",
    "the formulas are simply obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ sigma_tot_unique.eq ] ) , , and ( [ uniquesk.eq ] ) through replacement of @xmath159 by @xmath160    if the ground state of an atom is an s state with @xmath4 , which can be optically excited only to a p state with @xmath161 , we find @xmath162 and the @xmath102 coefficients simply reduce to @xmath163 we are back to the situation ( [ classic.eq ] ) where the atom radiates exactly like a classical point - dipole scatterer since only a single atomic transition @xmath164 is optically active .      the previous analysis can be extended to objects slightly more complex than atoms , but whose energy spectrum and eigenstates can still be calculated",
    "let us for example consider a diatomic molecule with rovibrational structure .",
    "if the molecular linewidths are sufficiently small for the rotational structure to be resolved , and if the incoming light is sufficiently monochromatic for a single rotational line to be resonant , then the molecule will scatter light with the specific radiation pattern of the resonant @xmath37 transition .",
    "this is because the wigner time delay is longer than the rotational period of the molecule .",
    "in contrast , if several @xmath165 rotational transitions have to be taken into account coherently , a sum over excited states has to be performed , very similar to the one in , with the only difference that the dipole matrix elements depend now on the molecular quantum numbers , instead of @xmath21 and @xmath166 these dipole elements are given in @xcite for various possible couplings .",
    "a full discussion is beyond the scope of this paper , but the net result is as expected : the sum simplifies thanks to sum rules over @xmath167 and @xmath66 symbols and the radiation pattern depends only on the electronic dipole transition considered . in the most common case where it is a @xmath168 transition ( the molecular equivalent of an atomic s @xmath169 p transition ) ,",
    "one recovers again as a net result the fact that the molecule scatters light like a rayleigh scatterer .    however , when several electronic states have to be taken into account  either in atoms or in molecules  interference between several transitions is in principle still present . when one considers larger objects , such as polyatomic molecules for example , the time scales are considerably affected .",
    "the total moment of inertia increases , making the rotation slower and the corresponding classical rotation time longer . at the same time , excitations of the object decay faster , making the wigner time delay shorter .",
    "rotational degrees of freedom are thus quenched .",
    "whenever the internal evolution time is longer than the wigner time delay , one expects the internal structure to be frozen and irrelevant for light scattering properties .",
    "generically , the shortest internal time scale which remains shorter than the wigner time delay , will be associated with the electronic excitation , which is the degree of freedom excited in the optical frequency range .",
    "an object with more than few atoms will thus scatter `` classically '' , i.e. , following the average electronic polarizability @xcite . for an object much smaller than the light wavelength ( such as a cluster with ,",
    "say , 1000 atoms ) , the multipolar expansion of the electronic polarizability will be dominated by the dipolar term , producing the dipole radiation pattern .",
    "there may of course be cases where the dipole contribution vanishes and higher orders dominate the radiation pattern , but such situations are certainly not generic .",
    "finally , for objects larger than the light wavelength , the shape of the object is resolved and determines the light scattering properties .",

    "anisotropic scattering populates all polarization channels and interference effects between the various hyperfine components are clearly made visible by the polarization analysis .",

    "the on - resonant predictions for well separated resonances , shown as symbols , neglect the interference between the different resonances and are clearly not suited for quantitative predictions .",
    "outside the multiplet , the double scattering cbs interference contrast approaches the maximum value 1 predicted for the isotropic dipole or non - degenerate transition @xmath228 in all channels ( beyond double scattering , the contrast is unity only in the parallel channels @xmath0 and @xmath212 ) , again in agreement with the general discussion in sec .",
    "[ classical.sec ] .",
    "considering only the resonance with highest frequency , here @xmath229 , it is evident that the interference contrast is generically larger towards the blue side in order to reach the optimal value 1 at large detuning .",
    "furthermore , the largest asymmetry or slope on resonance is found for the @xmath0 channel since it starts from the lowest contrast on resonance .",
    "these features , present in the figures of @xcite but unexplained by the authors , therefore find a natural explanation .",
    "the enhancement factor of the cbs cone is @xmath230 where @xmath231 and @xmath232 account for all multiple scattering orders .",
    "the presently derived weights @xmath218 can be used for evaluating the multiply scattered intensity via the propagation eigenvalues of the ladder and crossed series , @xmath233 and @xmath234 , as derived in @xcite . for third order scattering and beyond",
    ", exact analytic calculations become very complicated , and it is more convenient to turn to a monte carlo approach , as described in  @xcite . in fig .",
    "( d ) , we plot the cbs enhancement factor for @xmath198sr as a function of detuning , in the four polarization channels and for a semi - infinite medium .",
    "the most obvious observation is that the enhancement factors are typically small in the region of overlapping atomic transitions , and take larger values at large detuning , as expected from the transition to classical scattering behavior discussed in sec .",
    "[ classical.sec ] .",
    "high orders of scattering contribute significantly to the ladder intensity , but only weakly to the cbs contribution because phase coherence is rapidly lost after the average over atomic degrees of freedom .",
    "the enhancement factor thus behaves similarly to the double scattering contrast , only amplifying the changes with the detuning .",
    "a strong reduction of the cbs enhancement factor in the vicinity of a particular resonance may have various origins .",
    "for example , in the @xmath0 channel , for negative detuning , the double scattering contrast is rather high .",
    "this is because the dominant contribution comes from the @xmath203 transition of the @xmath235 type with large @xmath21 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the reduction of the enhancement factor here must be attributed to single scattering . for positive detuning ,",
    "the situation is opposite : single scattering is rather low , but also the double scattering contrast is poor .    in the orthogonal polarization channels @xmath213 and @xmath211 , the multiple scattering cbs shows small interference contrast , because ladder and cbs contributions probe different field correlations , and thus produce a small total enhancement factor . for parallel polarization channels , @xmath212 and @xmath0",
    ", the enhancement factor tends to a larger value . in the @xmath0 channel ,",
    "the coherent and incoherent contributions are asymptotically equal while single scattering tends to vanish . for infinite detuning",
    ", we recover the predictions for isotropic dipole scatterers due to ozrin @xcite : 2.0 ( @xmath0 ) , 1.25 ( @xmath211 ) , 1.75 ( @xmath212 ) , 1.12 ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "note , however , that this limit is reached very slowly : the enhancement hardly exceeds 1.5 in the @xmath0 channel for the largest detuning in fig .  , although it is twice as large as the total splitting @xmath143 of the hyperfine multiplet .",
    "the reason for the slow recovery is simple to understand : for a semi - infinite medium , long scattering paths contribute significantly to the cbs cone , with all paths beyond order @xmath215 giving an integrated contribution scaling like @xmath236 at large detuning , the @xmath237 coefficients tend to their limiting values like @xmath238 .",
    "this in turns implies that a fraction @xmath239 of the perfect contrast is lost at each scattering event , putting an effective cutoff @xmath240 on the scattering orders contributing to the cbs cone . altogether",
    ", this implies that the asymptotic value 2 for the enhancement factor is reached only like @xmath241 .",
    "in other words , even a small unresolved hyperfine structure may significantly reduce the interference contrast .",
    "this is a clear illustration that cbs  and any quantum interference for that matter  is very sensitive to small couplings to uncontrolled degrees of freedom .",
    "in the present paper , we have considered multiple scattering of photons by a disordered medium of atom at rest with several internal resonances .",
    "we have developed the analytical calculation of the total photon scattering cross section @xmath91 and the differential cross section @xmath242 as a function of the light frequency and of the relevant angular momentum parameters defining the internal resonances .",
    "we have examined under which conditions the various resonances conspire to yield the classical model of an isotropic dipole . as an application of the theory to multiple elastic scattering from hyperfine multiplets , we have calculated the cbs enhancement for a hypothetic half - space with a homogeneous average density of atoms .",
    "the present paper makes two major restrictive assumptions that should be lifted in subsequent investigations .",
    "first , the results presented in sec .  [ elastic.sec ] for the cbs enhancement factors have been calculated for the case of a closed transition with a unique ground state assuring purely elastic scattering . the more general case of inelastic scattering from open transitions",
    "can be treated along the same lines by using the analytical theory developed in section [ theory.sec ] .",
    "second , real experiments with cold atoms are not performed on semi - infinite homogeneous media , but on inhomogeneous clouds of finite optical thickness .",
    "their mean free path and thus the optical thickness change drastically under detuning from resonance .",
    "this in turn modifies the relative weight of different scattering orders and therefore also the enhancement factor .",
    "consequently , for scattering media of finite extent , these purely geometrical effects must be taken into account .",
    "an efficient numerical monte carlo method for this situation has been presented in @xcite .",
    "the above analytical expressions for the mean free path and the intensity vertex coefficients can be introduced into this program and permit to obtain accurate cbs enhancement factors and full peak shapes for quantitative comparison with experiments . however , both questions are beyond the scope of the present contribution and will be discussed elsewhere .",
