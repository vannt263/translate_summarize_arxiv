    "after recombination of the primordial plasma at @xmath2 , the universe entered an age of darkness .",
    "the primordial density fluctuations continued to grow , until non - linear gravitational collapse led to the formation of the first dark matter halos in which the gas could collapse , and then radiatively cool .",
    "the dark ages ended at the time when the first stars formed in these halos , with a characteristic mass of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "these first stars , as well as any black holes or neutron stars formed subsequently which could accrete surrounding matter , produced photons capable of ionizing hydrogen ( with wavelength @xmath4 ) .",
    "as soon as the ionizing radiation produced in the sites of star formation was able to escape into the low - density intergalactic medium , the process of reionization started . during reionization ,",
    "the ionized volume fraction of the universe increased gradually , until all the low - density regions were ionized .",
    "recent observations of the gunn - peterson trough @xcite at @xmath5 @xcite , indicate that the end of reionization probably occurred at @xmath6 , although the epoch at which reionization began is still unknown ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the redshifted 21 cm line opens up a promising window for observing this period of cosmic history .",
    "this line is produced by the transition between the singlet and triplet hyperfine levels of the hydrogen atom at the electronic ground state . the line can be observed in absorption or emission against the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the brightness temperature is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the hydrogen spin temperature and the cmb temperature , @xmath10 is the optical depth , @xmath11 is the density of atomic hydrogen and @xmath12 is the mean hydrogen density of the universe ( we have used the approximations @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "therefore , the detailed spectrum of the cmb at the long wavelengths of the redshifted 21 cm , when observed with high angular resolution , contains precious information on the patchwork of density , spin temperature , and ionization inhomogeneities during the era when the intergalactic medium was still atomic @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen spin temperature plays a key role in determining the amplitude of the 21 cm emission or absorption signal against the cmb . at the same time",
    ", the evolution of the spin temperature depends on the gas kinetic temperature , and the way that the hyperfine structure level populations couple to the cmb and the kinetic temperatures .",
    "the adiabatic cooling of the hydrogen due to the expansion of the universe causes the gas temperature to decline as @xmath15 , while the cmb temperature is decreasing only as @xmath16 , so the gas cools below the cmb . at redshifts @xmath17 ,",
    "the residual ionization left over from the epoch of recombination @xcite keeps the gas kinetic temperature at the cmb temperature owing to the heating produced by electron scattering of the cmb , but below this redshift this heating source becomes small and the gas temperature drops below the cmb . if the spin temperature can be coupled to the kinetic temperature at this stage , the atomic medium would be observed in absorption .",
    "the coupling of the spin and kinetic temperatures can be achieved by atomic collisions or by scattering of ly@xmath0  photons .",
    "the coupling due to atomic collisions is small except at very high redshift , where observations of the redshifted 21 cm radiation becomes more difficult , or for unrealistically high values of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "a stronger coupling can be induced by ly@xmath0  photons , which should be produced as soon as the first stars are formed .",
    "the ly@xmath0  photons couple the spin and kinetic temperatures by being repeatedly scattered in the gas .",
    "the resonance scattering of a photon consists of a transition from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , followed by the opposite downward transition .",
    "this scattering process can change the population of the hyperfine structure levels @xcite .",
    "the probabilities for a transition back to the ground or excited hyperfine structure states depend on the slope of the radiation spectrum near the ly@xmath0  line center , or the `` color temperature '' .",
    "when the radiation spectrum reaches a steady state , this color temperature near the ly@xmath0  line center is equal to the gas kinetic temperature , so the ly@xmath0  scatterings introduce a thermal coupling between the spin and kinetic temperature .",
    "the result of these couplings is that the spin temperature is given by @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 here , @xmath23 is the kinetic temperature , @xmath24k is the hyperfine energy splitting , @xmath25 is the spontaneous emission coefficient of the 21 cm line , and @xmath26 is the collisional de - excitation rate of the excited hyperfine level .",
    "the value of @xmath27 ranges from @xmath28 to @xmath29 for @xmath30 in the range @xmath31 k and was tabulated in @xcite .",
    "the indirect de - excitation rate @xmath32 of the hyperfine structure levels is related to the total ly@xmath0  scattering rate @xmath33 by @xmath34 @xcite , which is given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the number density of photons per unit frequency , and @xmath37 is the cross section for ly@xmath0  scattering ( @xcite , hereafter mmr ) .    besides coupling the spin temperature and kinetic temperature of the gas",
    ", the scattering of ly@xmath0  photons may also heat up the gas . in this paper , we present the scattering rate and heating rate due to ly@xmath0  photons in a uniform atomic intergalactic medium as a function of the two parameters they depend on : the gas temperature and the ly@xmath0  scattering optical depth of the medium ( or gunn - peterson optical depth ) .",
    "there are two different ways in which photons propagating through the atomic medium may reach the ly@xmath0  line , and start being repeatedly scattered by hydrogen : ( a ) photons that are emitted between the ly@xmath0  and ly@xmath38 wavelengths by sources such as massive stars will be redshifted as they penetrate the atomic medium until they reach the ly@xmath0  wavelength .",
    "these photons enter the ly@xmath0  line from its blue wing , and will be called _ continuum _ photons in this paper .",
    "( b ) photons that are emitted at wavelengths shorter than ly@xmath38 , but still longer than the lyman limit so that they can penetrate deep into the atomic medium , will redshift until they reach the ly@xmath38 or a higher lyman series line , and will then be converted into a ly@xmath0 photon when the hydrogen atom they excite decays first to the 2p state before reaching the ground state .",
    "these photons will be injected near the ly@xmath0  line center with a distribution determined by the voigt function , and will be called _ injected _ photons .",
    "these two types of photons result in different scattering and heating rates , so results will be presented separately for both of them .",
    "mmr estimated the heating rate due to ly@xmath0  photons by assuming that the average relative change in a ly@xmath0  photon energy in each scattering is the same as when the photon is scattered by an atom at rest : @xmath39 .",
    "hence , they assumed that the total energy transfer rate is @xmath40 at the thermalization rate @xmath41 ( which is the rate @xmath33 required to bring the spin temperature close to the kinetic temperature ) , the heating rate assumed by mmr is @xmath42 , which would heat up the gas kinetic temperature above the cmb temperature in a fraction of a hubble time at @xmath43 .    in the present investigation",
    "we calculate the heating rate of the continuum and injected ly@xmath0  photons by computing the background spectrum near the ly@xmath0  line using the fokker - planck method introduced by @xcite ( hereafter rd ) , and using energy conservation .",
    "we find that the heating rate due to ly@xmath0  scattering is much smaller than the estimate of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mmrheatrate ] ) , and as a consequence ly@xmath0  photons do not constitute a significant heating source of the gas . calculating the heating rate caused by ly@xmath0  photons",
    "as if every atom were at rest , without taking into account the thermal motions , is incorrect , and as we shall see the heating rate per unit volume is not proportional to the atomic density .",
    "we explain in the appendix the reason why the argument used by mmr in their appendix b to justify using eq .",
    "( [ eq : mmrheatrate ] ) for the heating rate is invalid . as pointed out by mmr ,",
    "x - rays are important in pre - heating the atomic medium before it is reionized .",
    "in fact , our work leads to the conclusion that x - rays are the only important source of heating before the atomic medium is reached by an ionization front .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  2 we describe our method of calculation .",
    "we present our result on scattering and heating rates in  3 , explaining the physical reason why gas is not heated by ly@xmath0  photons as if every atom were at rest .",
    "we illustrate the consequences for future 21 cm observations in  4 , with an example for the evolution of the spin temperature with redshift , including also a model for x - ray heating .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  5 .",
    "we adopt a flat @xmath44cdm model with the following cosmological parameters : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the code for solving the line profile and calculating the scattering and heating rates is available from the authors .",
    "our goal in this work is to compute the ly@xmath0  scattering rate and the heating rate of hydrogen induced by this scattering , from which one can then compute the evolution of the spin temperature .",
    "the scattering and heating rates can be calculated once the background spectrum near the ly@xmath0  line is known .",
    "let us consider the background of photons produced by constant , flat spectrum sources in an expanding universe ( in practice the intrinsic source spectrum does not matter because ly@xmath0  scattering is important only on a very narrow range of frequencies around ly@xmath0  , in which the intrinsic source spectrum can be considered to be constant ) . in the absence of scattering , the photons would simply redshift and would produce a photon number density per unit frequency @xmath50 that is independent of frequency near ly@xmath0  .",
    "the presence of scatterings by hydrogen introduces a feature in the spectrum around the ly@xmath0  line , which has a constant shape @xmath51 once a steady - state is reached .",

    "we will also use the photon intensity @xmath64 . with these definitions ,",
    "the scattering rate is @xmath65    the heating rate of the gas induced by ly@xmath0  scattering can be simply obtained by requiring conservation of energy .",
    "the scatterings cause the cosmic background to have a narrow spectral feature around the ly@xmath0  wavelength .",
    "were the scatterings to cease at a certain instant , this feature would simply be redshifted to longer wavelengths . instead ,",
    "when a steady - state spectrum is reached , the feature is fixed at a constant wavelength . the reduction in energy per unit volume of the background due to this feature is @xmath66\\ , h\\nu\\ , d\\nu$ ] ( for the purpose of this discussion we ignore the photons injected at the ly@xmath0  wavelength by recombinations , so that in the absence of scatterings , @xmath50 ; injected photons will be fully considered later ) . over an interval of time",

    "an alternative derivation of the heating rate in equation ( [ eq : heatrate1 ] ) is given in the appendix .",
    "the spectrum of the cosmic background near ly@xmath0  is determined by the radiative transfer equation for resonant scattering for a homogeneous and isotropic expanding universe , which is ( rd ) @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the mean free time between scatterings for a photon at the line center , @xmath71 is the physical time , and @xmath75 is the number density of hydrogen atoms in the ground state .",

    "the first term in the right - hand - side of equation ( [ eq : rd ] ) describes the removal of photons that are scattered , and the second term accounts for the redshift .",
    "the third term represents the addition of the photons redistributed over frequency after scattering @xcite , and the fourth term is due to the injection of new ly@xmath0  photons with a spectral profile @xmath78 .    in the fokker - planck approximation , the scattering problem is treated as diffusion in the approximation that the width of the spectral feature is large compared to the frequency change in typical scatterings .",

    "we note that the solution for the spectral profile of continuum and injected photons has a characteristic width in the variable @xmath109 that is substantially larger than unity , implying that the fokker - planck approximation we have used should be accurate .",
    "the heating and scattering rates are of course proportional to the background intensity . during the epoch of reionization ,",
    "at least one ionizing photon has to be emitted for every baryon in the universe , and more if the typical baryon can recombine many times .",
    "the number of ly@xmath0  photons emitted is of the same order for sources without a large lyman break , and can be much larger if many ionizing photons are internally absorbed .",
    "we use the intensity corresponding to one photon per hydrogen atom in the universe as a fiducial value : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the hydrogen number density . for reference to other work ,",
    "we quote also the value of the energy intensity of this unit : @xmath112 .",

    "however , one can easily prove that the result is exactly the same as what is obtained by subtracting instead the step function spectrum that results from a @xmath119 function of the injected photons . in fig .",
    "[ jinj ] , we show the spectrum @xmath85 for two different temperatures : @xmath122k and @xmath123k , for @xmath124 . in the @xmath125k case , we have @xmath126 .",
    "this negative heating rate means that the scattering of these injected photons actually cools the gas , because some of the photons are scattered to the blue side of the spectrum and gain energy from the hydrogen gas . at lower gas temperatures , as in the @xmath127k case shown in the figure , @xmath128",
    ", the photons heat the gas .",
    "however , at @xmath98 the temperature of adiabatically expanding gas is 2.65 k , and there is no known mechanism which could cool the gas below this temperature , so the net effect of the injected photons must be to cool the gas . in any case , both the heating rate due to continuum photons and the cooling rate due to injected photons are very small .    to calculate the spin temperature from equation ( 2 )",
    ", we also need to know the scattering rate of the ly@xmath0  photons in equation ( [ eq : scatrate1 ] ) , which can be reexpressed as @xmath129 we define @xmath130 we plot the integrals @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 as a function of @xmath76 , for several different temperatures , in figures [ icii]-  [ scsi ] . our code calculates the values of these integrals for any given gas temperature and optical depth .",
    "the intensity corresponding to the thermalization rate required to bring the spin temperature down to the kinetic temperature ( see the introduction ) is @xmath135 where the subscripts @xmath136 or @xmath137 can be applied . for the case @xmath138 and @xmath96 k at @xmath98 , @xmath134 or @xmath133 are close to one and we find @xmath139 .",
    "thus , from our earlier result that the heating rate in this case is @xmath118 for the case of continuum photons , we find that over the time that continuum ly@xmath0  photons bring the spin temperature down to the gas temperature , they should heat the gas by only @xmath140 k , and injected photons should cool the gas by @xmath141 k.    the reason why the heating rate is much less than the value obtained by assuming that each atom loses the same average energy at each scattering as if it were at rest is that the intensity of the background spectrum drops steeply at the ly@xmath0  line center , as shown in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the vast majority of the scatterings occur within a few thermal widths of the line center , where the color temperature of the spectrum ( reflecting its slope ) is almost equal to the kinetic temperature .",
    "when these two temperatures are the same , there obviously can not be any heat exchange between photons and atoms because they are in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the heating from continuum photons occurs because the color temperature is slightly larger than the kinetic temperature .",
    "injected photons have a temperature slightly lower than the kinetic temperature , so they cool the gas .",
    "cooling is caused by photons that are on the red side of the line center because these photons are more likely to be scattered by atoms moving in the direction opposite to the photon ( for which the doppler effect can shift the photon frequency to the line center ) , and these atoms will be slowed down by the scattering .",
    "when the color temperature is below the kinetic temperature , the cooling effect due to the preferential scattering of photons moving in the opposite direction than the atoms is greater than the heating effect due to recoil from photons moving in a random direction .",
    "the heating or cooling rates per unit volume are not proportional to the atom density .",
    "if the atom density is increased , not only the number of scatterings increases , but also the color temperature is brought closer to the kinetic temperature because of the increased rate of interaction between atoms and photons , and the average energy exchanged between them at each scattering is reduced .",
    "the heating rate changes only with the width of the background spectral feature that determines the integrals @xmath131 and @xmath132 , according to the energy conservation argument used in  2 .    in the calculation of the spin temperature evolution from equation ( 2 )",
    ", we assume that the color temperature of the ly@xmath0  photons is equal to the gas kinetic temperature .",
    "this is true at the line center in the limit of large optical depth ( field 1958 , 1959 ) , but the slope of the photon distribution varies outside the line center . in the more general case , equations ( [ eq : ts])-([eq : y ] ) can be generalized as @xmath142 @xmath143 where the color temperature @xmath144 at @xmath145 is defined by @xmath146 and @xmath147 because the vast majority of scatterings occur near the line center , where the color temperature and kinetic temperature are very nearly the same , this generalization does not significantly change the result for the spin temperature .",
    "we have found by a numerical test that this correction affects the spin temperature by only a small fraction of a percent .",
    "we will now consider a simple model where the emissivity of ly@xmath0  photons turns on at a redshift @xmath148 and increases linearly with redshift thereafter .",
    "we will also consider the effect of x - ray emission from the same star formation regions , which dominates the heating rate of the gas .",
    "this will illustrate a plausible thermal history of the gas and the expected strength of the absorption or emission signal in the redshifted 21 cm line .",
    "the kinetic temperature of the gas in the expanding universe evolves as @xmath149 where @xmath150 and @xmath151 are the total heating and cooling rates , respectively , and @xmath152 is the total gas number density .    in the absence of heating and cooling ,",
    "the gas temperature decreases adiabatically with @xmath153 .",
    "we use the code recfast @xcite to calculate the temperature evolution of the gas before the first stars and quasars turn on .",
    "we note that at @xmath154 the spin temperature drops below the cmb temperature due to the collisional coupling ( in fig .",
    "6 , this drop is seen at the highest redshift end ) .",
    "the corresponding absorption is , however , difficult to observe at the very long wavelengths corresponding to this redshift . at lower redshifts ,",
    "the spin temperature is practically equal to the cmb temperature until the first ly@xmath0  photons are produced .      if the comoving photon emissivity ( defined as the number of photons emitted per unit comoving volume , time and frequency ) at the ly@xmath0  line from stars at redshift @xmath155 is @xmath156 , then the _ comoving _",
    "ly@xmath0  photon intensity at redshift @xmath155 is given by @xmath157 where the emissivity spectrum is assumed to be @xmath158 , and @xmath159 is determined by the condition that only the photons emitted at frequencies lower than the ly@xmath38 line will not interact with the intergalactic medium : @xmath160    to discuss the plausible range of values of the comoving emissivity , it is convenient to introduce the unit @xmath161 thus , if @xmath162 , one photon is being emitted per hydrogen atom and per hubble time , per unit @xmath163 .    during the epoch of reionization , at least one photon must be emitted for every baryon in the universe .",
    "for a homogeneous medium , the recombination rate @xmath164 is equal to the hubble rate , @xmath70 , at @xmath6 ; hence , if reionization takes place during the interval @xmath165 , a few photons should be emitted for every baryon to ionize them and to compensate for recombination .",
    "the number of recombinations can be increased due to the clumping factor of the ionized intergalactic gas ( see , however , @xcite for a discussion of why the clumping factor of ionized gas is probably not much larger than unity during the epoch of reionization ) .",
    "if these ionizing photons are produced by star - forming regions , then the photon emissivity per unit @xmath163 between ly@xmath0  and the lyman limit should be 3 to 5 times larger than the emissivity of ionizing photons , owing to the average lyman break of the atmospheres of massive stars with a salpeter initial mass function ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the photons between ly@xmath0  and the lyman limit may have a larger escape fraction from the star formation regions than the ionizing photons ( if some of the absorption is due to local hydrogen with low dust content ) , in which case the ratio of the emissivity between ly@xmath0  and lyman limit to the ionizing emissivity would be further increased .",
    "this suggests that the emissivity near ly@xmath0  should be at least @xmath166 .    the total number of ionizing photons emitted is also related to the metallicity produced by massive stars . to produce one ionizing photon per baryon",

    "there , they photoionize hydrogen or helium , and the high - energy electron that is produced can then transfer a fraction of its energy to the gas by coulomb collisions with other electrons and protons .",
    "once the energy has been thermalized among the charged particles at a temperature low enough to avoid losses by collisional excitation of hydrogen , the thermal energy can be transferred to the hydrogen atoms in slow collisions involving dipole interaction .",
    "the fraction of the x - ray energy that can be converted to the gas thermal energy ( rather than being used in collisional ionizations and excitations of hydrogen or helium ) depends on the fractional ionization of the gas . using the recfast code",
    ", we found that the initial ionized fraction from the recombination era ( before more ionizations are caused by the x - rays ) is @xmath190 , which implies that a fraction of 14% of the x - ray energy is used to heat the gas @xcite .",
    "as the fraction of free electrons increases , this fraction also increases , but for simplicity we shall assume it a constant .",
    "we parameterize the emissivity in x - rays in terms of the fraction of the energy that is emitted in x - rays compared to the energy emitted at ly@xmath0  per unit @xmath191 , which we designate as @xmath192 .",
    "the x - ray heating rate is then @xmath193 where @xmath194 is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : epsz ] ) , and @xmath195 is the planck constant . at @xmath196 ,",
    "the heating rate due to x - rays in this model is @xmath197 therefore , by emitting only @xmath198 1% of the energy as x - rays , the sources can rapidly heat the intergalactic medium to temperatures above the cmb .      the evolution of the gas kinetic and spin temperatures in the absence of x - ray heating is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ts ] , for two values of the initial redshift ( @xmath186 and @xmath199 ) , and two values of the emissivity ( @xmath200 and @xmath201 ) .    in the absence of x - rays",
    ", the heating due to ly@xmath0  scattering is very low and the kinetic temperature of the gas deviates only slightly from the adiabatic curve at late times . for our assumed emissivity of 10 to 100 photons per baryon per hubble time , the spin temperature drops to values very close to the kinetic temperature , producing a large absorption signal on the cmb of up to @xmath202 mk , as seen in figure 7 .",
    "figure 8 shows the thermal evolution and the resulting antenna temperature when we include x - ray heating with @xmath203 , for the case @xmath187 and @xmath204 . with only 1% of the energy emitted as x - rays , the kinetic temperature of the gas increases rapidly when the first sources turn on , leaving only a brief period of absorption in the beginning of small amplitude , which then turns to emission , with an amplitude of less than 20 mk",
    "we have calculated the ly@xmath0  photon scattering and heating rates in the atomic intergalactic medium , including both redshifted continuum photons emitted between ly@xmath0  and ly@xmath38 , and injected photons produced by recombinations or excitations by ly@xmath38 and higher lyman series photons .",
    "the heating rate of the gas due to the scattering of these ly@xmath0  photons is very small and essentially negligible . in the absence of other heating sources",
    ", the gas would continue to cool down almost adiabatically while the spin temperature would rapidly drop to nearly the kinetic temperature given a reasonable emission of photons during the reionization epoch .",
    "this would produce a 21 cm absorption against the cmb as large as @xmath198 200 mk , at the average hydrogen density of the universe .    of course",
    ", if the absorption signal can be observed at high angular and frequency resolution , the antenna temperature should fluctuate around its mean value owing to density fluctuations , as well as spin temperature fluctuations that would be produced by spatial variations in the history of the photon emissivity between ly@xmath0  and the lyman limit ( e.g.@xcite ) . at the same time , during the epoch of reionization , there should be a gradual increase of the fraction of the volume that is ionized ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the average antenna temperature should then be multiplied by the fraction of baryons that remain in atomic form . because this fraction of baryons should decrease gradually , any 21 cm absorption or emission",
    "should also vary smoothly with redshift .",
    "unfortunately , the large absorption signal predicted in the absence of x - ray heating is unlikely to be present .",
    "it is very likely that significant x - ray emission is produced within only a few million years of the formation of the first stars in the universe : some of the stars may be in binaries which will evolve into high - mass x - ray binaries , and supernova explosions can also emit soft x - rays ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "photons with energies as low as @xmath205 kev can propagate as far as 3 comoving mpc over the atomic intergalactic medium at @xmath206 before they are absorbed by hydrogen or helium .",
    "there may still be some ways in which certain regions of the intergalactic medium may be illuminated by ly@xmath0  photons from the first stars , without receiving soft x - rays as well .",
    "for example , if stars form in a region with a high column density of hydrogen and helium with very little dust , and the hydrogen and/or helium is not fully ionized for a long time , the photons between ly@xmath0  and the lyman limit from stars would escape , while the ionizing and soft x - ray photons might all be locally absorbed .",
    "in particular , there is the possibility that singly ionized helium remains self - shielded as massive stars ionize the gas around them .",
    "we note from figure 6 that the time required to bring down the spin temperature can be very short ( @xmath207 years or less ) for typical values of the ly@xmath0  background intensity , and it is possible that a complete absorption of soft x - rays from the first star - forming regions would persist long enough to allow for a strong 21 cm absorption signal in local regions of the intergalactic medium , when they are illuminated by the first light from stars forming in their vicinity .",
    "nevertheless , it seems likely that any decrease of the spin temperature will be short - lived , and that x - ray heating will cause the 21 cm signal to switch to emission a short time after the first stars are formed .",
    "future observations of the 21 cm signal in absorption and emission at high angular and frequency resolution have an enormous potential for revealing the details of the reionization epoch .",
    "fluctuations in the antenna temperature arise from both gas density and spin temperature variations .",
    "the density fluctuations will inform us of the state of gravitational evolution of primordial fluctuations at the highest attainable redshifts after recombination , while the spin temperature fluctuations will reveal the spatial distribution of the first sources of ultraviolet and x - ray emission in the universe .",
    "this work was supported in part by nsf grants nsf-0098515 and phy99 - 07949 .",
    "mmr assumed that the heating rate per unit volume of the hydrogen gas due to ly@xmath0  scattering is equal to the recoil energy given to a hydrogen atom at rest , @xmath208 , times the scattering rate : @xmath209 this heating rate was justified from equation ( [ eq : fp ] ) for the time evolution of the photon intensity @xmath210 .",
    "mmr assumed that the rate of heat transfer to the atoms is determined by the change in the spectrum due to the recoil effect , which is the second term in the right - hand - side of equation ( [ eq : fp ] ) : @xmath211 they then computed the heating rate by integrating the variation in photon energy density per unit physical time over frequency : @xmath212 where the integral @xmath133 is given in equation ( [ eq : scati ] ) , and @xmath213 is the gunn - peterson optical depth ( all symbols are defined in  2 and 3 ; the last equality involves an integration by parts ) .",
    "however , the first term in equation ( [ eq : fp ] ) must also be included to compute the heating rate of the gas .",
    "in fact , the heating rate of the gas is not just determined by the recoil , but also by the fact that the background intensity is greater on the red wing of the ly@xmath0  line than on the blue wing , and scatterings have an average tendency to bring photons back into the line center .",
    "the energy change of the photons due to the first term in equation ( [ eq : fp ] ) can only go into the gas ( whereas that of the third term is due to redshift and goes into the expansion of the universe , and that of the fourth term is provided by a source ) .",
    "thus , the correct heating rate is @xmath214 under steady - state conditions ( and no source term ; here , we consider continuum photons only , to simplify the discussion ) , we can replace the quantity inside parenthesis by @xmath215 , and integrating by parts , we obtain @xmath216 which is the expression in equation ( [ eq : heatr2c ] ) .",
    "note that , because @xmath217 , the heating rate per unit volume is independent of the atomic density , except for the weak dependence of @xmath131 on @xmath213 , whereas mmr assumed that the heating rate _ per atom _ is independent of @xmath111 ."
