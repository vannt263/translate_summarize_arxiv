    "several bound systems of young , massive clusters in colliding galaxies have been observed using the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "the best studied case is the antenn galaxies ( ngc 4038/4039 ) , the nearest example of two colliding disc galaxies listed in the @xcite sequence .",
    "hst observations reveal in this system the existence of relatively small regions ( compared with the size of the galaxies ) harbouring hundreds or thousands of young clusters @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite observed @xmath1 areas ( `` knots '' ) of sizes spanning @xmath2  pc which contain hundreds of clusters .",
    "the mass function of those systems , which we will henceforth refer to as `` cluster complexes '' ( ccs ) , is    @xmath3    with @xmath4 in the range @xmath5 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found in the same system low - mass ccs with masses around @xmath6 and diameters of some @xmath7  pc .",
    "one of the best studied ccs in the antenn galaxy is `` knot s '' , with a total mass of @xmath8 and a total radius of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "other galaxies with recently discovered ccs include ngc  7673 @xcite , m82 @xcite , ngc  6745 @xcite , stephan s quintet @xcite and ngc  922 @xcite .",
    "ccs are bound systems @xcite and on relatively short time - scales at least some of their member clusters will merge to form a single object . @xcite and @xcite have postulated ccs as the breeding ground of ultra - compact dwarf galaxies ( ucds ) .",
    "following this idea , @xcite performed @xmath10body simulations of ccs with different total masses ( @xmath11 ) and initial plummer radii @xmath12  pc .",
    "they conclude that ucds , extended clusters ( ecs ) or even large globular clusters ( gcs ) might be the product of an agglomeration of clusters in ccs .",
    "they find in their simulations that almost all members of a cc merge in less than 1  gyr . in some cases",
    "this timescale can be as short as 10  myr . by the end of their simulations a very massive cluster forms in the centre of the cc , with a mass of @xmath13 the mass of the initial cc and a radius of @xmath14  pc .",
    "theoretical and numerical studies show that at least a fraction of young star clusters could host intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs , black holes with masses ranging between @xmath15 ) at their centres .",
    "a possible formation path is that in a young cluster , the most massive stars sink to the centre due to mass segregation . after a high - density stellar region forms ,",
    "stars start to collide and merge with each other .",
    "a number of numerical studies with rather different approaches show that , under these circumstances , at least one of the stars increases its mass rapidly in a process of runaway collisions @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , there are a number of open questions regarding this process .",
    "one of the main uncertainties is the role of stellar winds . in principle at approximately solar metallicity winds may limit the mass of this very massive star ( vms ) to a few hundreds of solar masses rather than a few thousands @xcite .",
    "nevertheless we note that this requires a substantial extrapolation of already uncertain wind loss rates to stellar masses an order of magnitude beyond what is observed .",
    "also , the collision process might lead to lumpy bags of stellar cores in an extended envelope rather than to relaxed stars near the end of the runaway collision ( m. davies , private communication ) .",
    "in addition , when @xcite combined direct @xmath10body simulations with smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) they found that stellar winds would not hinder the formation of the vms . it is thus possible but not certain that imbhs can form in young clusters .",
    "we will assume their existence as a working hypothesis .",
    "apart from the obvious interesting implications for models of galaxy formation and , in particular , of ucds , mergers of clusters in ccs are a powerful source of gravitational waves if these harbour central imbhs in their respective centres @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite showed that such mergers would lead to the formation of an imbh binary , which would merge in a time scale as short as @xmath16  myr .",
    "such a merger would be easily detected with space - borne observatories and also with ground - based detectors such as advanced ligo or advanced virgo ( adligo / advirgo ) if it occurs within @xmath17  gpc @xcite . using more realistic waveforms including spins",
    ", @xcite find that the detection distance is increased significantly , up to an orientation - averaged distance of @xmath18 gpc , depending on the spin configuration and mass ratios . in the case of the einstein telescope",
    "( et ) , the same authors find that the maximum redshifts for et are @xmath19 , which implies that binaries of imbhs will be a cosmological probe .",
    "numerical relativity simulations show that during the merger of the holes , gravitational radiation is emitted asymmetrically with the size of asymmetry depending on the mass ratio of the two black holes and on their spin magnitude and orientation @xcite if this recoiling velocity exceeds a few times the velocity dispersion of the merged cluster , then the imbh leaves the host cluster .",
    "there is a massive black hole at large in the cc .",
    "even if an imbh escapes from one cluster , it might still be bound to the cc as a whole , which means that it has the possibility of interacting with other clusters and , perhaps , their imbhs .    in this article",
    "we address the formation of ultra - compact dwarf galaxies by the agglomeration of young clusters in ccs , along with the role of one or more recoiling imbhs , using direct - summation @xmath10body simulations .",
    "for this , we run a set of @xmath20 individual experiments in which we vary mass ratios , relative speeds , and impact parameter to study in detail the interaction between a single imbh and a cluster .",
    "we then study the interaction of one or more imbhs at large in a cc with individual clusters with an additional set of @xmath10body simulations .",
    "we correct for the trajectory of the imbh , based on point dynamics and the mass loss in the individual clusters , by using the previous 200 experiments .",
    "we also follow the growth of a seed ucd in a cc and record all stellar disruptions triggered by the presence of the imbh(s ) .",
    "for realistic models of ccs we find that the imbh(s ) end up captured by the seed ucd or by a smaller cluster which is close to the ucd .",
    "thus , if the fraction of imbhs in the cc ( @xmath21 from now onwards ) is not zero , this is a process of allocating one or more imbh at the very centre of a ucd .",
    "in this section we make a study of the parameter space for a collision between a recoiling imbh and an individual young cluster in a cc .",
    "we run a set of @xmath22 200 direct @xmath10body simulations to build a grid which we will later use in our simulations of the imbh in the cc , as explained in the introduction .",
    "initially we set the imbh and the cluster on an orbit with positive relative speed and thus positive total energy in the initial state , i.e. a hyperbolic orbit , as described in @xcite .",
    "we schematically show this for reference in fig.([fig.parabola ] ) and follow a similar notation .",
    "the initial trajectory of the imbh would bring it within a minimum distance @xmath23 of the cluster centre if the cluster was replaced by a point particle . in the centre - of - mass reference frame ( com ) ,    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the relative velocity of the two objects @xmath26 is their separation vector , @xmath27 are the positions of their centres , and @xmath28 .",
    "the number of stars in the cluster is always @xmath29 and we use for their initial distribution a king model of concentration @xmath30 @xcite , and all stars have the same mass , to simplify the interpretation of the results , although we note that a mass function could have an impact in the outcome of individual hits .",
    "stellar evolution is not taken into account for the same reason .",
    "although the number of stars we simulate is still below of what we can expect from a real cluster , we deem the dynamical interaction to be correct but for probably the most extreme mass ratios in which the mass ratio between the imbh and the total mass in the cluster is one and two .",
    "we include these cases for completness but note that in those cases the stars in those clusters do not represent a single star but a set of them .",
    "i.e. the imbh will hit lighter clusters with those mass ratios , and the orbital evolution of the imbh will be correctly estimated in our simulations , but the trajectory of a single star in such clusters does not trace one single star , but a set of them .",
    "the simulations are performed with the direct - summation nbody4 programme of @xcite .",
    "this choice was made for the sake of the accuracy of the study of the orbital parameter evolution of the imbh and mass loss in the cluster ; this numerical tool includes both the ks regularisation @xcite and chain regularisation , which means that when two or more particles are tightly bound to each other or the separation is very small during a hyperbolic encounter , the system becomes a candidate to be regularised in order to avoid problematical small individual time steps .",
    "the basis of direct @xmath10body codes relies on a hermite integrator scheme @xcite for which we need not only the accelerations but also their time derivatives .",
    "this extra computational overhead is necessary for us to follow reliably the orbital evolution of _ every _ single star ( or imbh ) in our system . while the code was not meant to integrate clusters in which a particle is significantly much more massive than the rest of them , a mass ratio of the order of what we have considered in this study leads to an accurate integration , with individual time integration errors of the order of @xmath31 in energy .    at the end of an @xmath32-body run ,",
    "we need to identify the particles that are still forming a bound cluster , the particles that are bound to the imbh , and the particles that have become unbound .",
    "we also need to know whether the imbh has been captured by the stellar cluster .",
    "we have therefore developed an iterative algorithm . to initialize the procedure",
    ", we make a ( computationally ) quick guess of which particles are bound to the cluster and which ones form a bound group including the imbh ( the `` imbh group '' ) .",
    "note that a given particle can be in both groups , for instance if the imbh has been captured by the cluster and has sunk to its centre or is orbiting it .",
    "for this first guess , stellar particles are considered bound to the imbh group if they are bound to the imbh ( i.e. , we do not take into account the self - gravity of the bound stars themselves ) .",
    "for the first - guess cluster , one assumes that its centre corresponds to the median position of all stellar particles , i.e. the @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 components of the `` centre '' are taken to be the medians of the corresponding components of the positions of all the stellar particles .",
    "the median turns out to be a much more robust estimate of where the bulk of the particles is , compared to the average position or the centre of mass ( i.e. the mass - weighted average position ) as those quantities are very sensitive to the the positions of a few particles ejected at large distances from the rest . for this first guess ,",
    "the 90% of the particles closest to this median position are assumed to be part of the cluster .",
    "for the first iteration , we have to compute the binding energy of a particle relative to the cluster group , hence we need to know the velocity of that group . to estimate the velocity of the cluster in the first - guess attribution , we take the average velocity of the 10% of the particles closest to the assumed centre . this number is sufficient to avoid large fluctuations due to individual particle velocities ( `` random velocities '' ) .",
    "on the other hand , taking a significantly larger fraction of particles is neither necessary nor advisable as it is not yet known which particles are actually bound together as a cluster .",
    "we have to make sure that the velocity defined in the procedure is a good estimate of that of the actual bound cluster .",
    "otherwise , the kinetic energies relative to this first - guess cluster are biased towards high values and the iterative procedure fails at identifying a bound cluster .",
    "the iterations proceed as follows : for each particle , the binding energies relative to the cluster and the imbh group are computed . for this",
    ", we have to estimate the position of the centre of each group and its velocity . for the imbh group , they are fixed to the values of the imbh itself . for the cluster ,",
    "the centre position and velocity are defined to be the mass - weighted mean values for all particles within half a `` typical size '' of the previous estimate of the centre .",
    "the typical size of the cluster is the harmonic mean of the distance to its centre ( for all particles considered bound to it ) :    @xmath36    one advantage of defining @xmath37 using the harmonic mean , instead of using the half - mass radius or some other lagrangian radius , is that this does not require a sorting of the particles . the gravitational energy is computed assuming a spherical mass distribution , i.e. , as if each particle bound to a group ( cluster or imbh group ) was a spherical shell of matter , of radius @xmath38 centred on either the imbh position or the estimated centre of the cluster .",
    "typically , the attributions of the particles to either or both groups converge after fewer than ten iterations .    at the end",
    ", the attributions are cleaned up in the following way . if a stellar particle belongs to both the cluster and the imbh group , the binding energies to both structures",
    "are compared .",
    "it will be kept as member of the imbh group only if the binding energy to the imbh group is larger than to the cluster group . in that case",
    ", it will also be kept as member of the cluster only if the imbh itself is bound to the cluster .",
    "this reduces the number of double - members in a reasonable way , still allowing for situations such as the imbh having captured some stars while being itself on a bound orbit around the ( main ) cluster .    finally , to interpret the results , we allow for three different outcomes",
    "a _ merger _ is when the imbh group is bound to the cluster ( as determined assuming each group is a point mass ) and the distance between the centres of the groups is smaller than the sum of the @xmath37 s .",
    "situation arises when the two groups are bound but the distance between their centre is larger than twice the sum of the @xmath37 s .",
    "flyby _ is when the groups are unbound and the distance between their centres is larger than either the sum of the total extent of each group or five times the sum of the @xmath39 s .",
    "any other situation would be considered as _ unknown _ but does not occur if the @xmath10body simulation has been carried out for a sufficient duration .    in fig.([fig.dmin1_imbh_300_vnfty_1kms ] ) and [ fig.dmin5_imbh_10k_vnfty_3kms ] we show two particular cases for the imbh  cluster interaction in the com frame which , although not representative for the whole sample displayed in fig.([fig.outcomes ] ) , are interesting in terms of the dynamics of the system . in the first case @xmath40 , which leads to an almost head - on collision between the imbh and the cluster .",
    "nonetheless , because of the low relative velocity and mass ratio , the interaction does not lead to a huge mass loss from the cluster .",
    "even if at @xmath41 myr the imbh and cluster seen to be unbound , the imbh is still forming a binary with the com of the cluster and , hence , the semi - major axis decays again .",
    "after some 154 myrs the imbh settles down to the centre and is captured . in the second figure ,",
    "the larger mass ratio has a significant impact in terms of mass loss .",
    "already after 11.62 myr the imbh has captured some stars from the cluster , which remain bound to the trajectory of the hole and follow its trajectory .",
    "this satellite and the imbh are nevertheless still gravitationally bound to the cluster and hence fall back again .",
    "the higher mass in the imbh ",
    "satellite system leads to a rather large mass loss from the original cluster .",
    "after 80.50 myrs the imbh is at the centre of the remaining cluster .",
    "now that we have completed the grid of individual imbh - cluster interactions , we can explore the scenario in which one imbh is at large in a cc , interacting with many different imbh on its way , either to an eventual escape from the cc , or down to the very centre , where the seed of a ucd is forming by the mergers of clusters . in this section we will assume @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the total number of clusters in the cc ; that is , only two clusters in the whole cc harbour an imbh and we also assume that they have coalesced and the merged hole escaped from the host cluster .",
    "as we will see , the presence of the imbh triggers stellar disruptions in individual clusters of the cc , which could potentially represent a fingerprint of this process . in next section",
    "we will look at larger values of @xmath21 .",
    "the numerical code that we use for the simulations of the cc and the imbh is ` myriad ` @xcite , which uses the hermite fourth - order predictor - corrector scheme with block time steps @xcite for advancing the particles in time , while the accelerations and their derivatives are computed using grape-6 @xcite special purpose computers .",
    "close encounters between particles ( i.e. between clusters or between the imbh and a cluster ) are detected using the grape-6 and evolved with a time - symmetric hermite fourth - order integrator @xcite . even though the code was originally designed for dynamical simulations of stars in star clusters ,",
    "its flexible modularity made it easy to adapt to our particular problem .",
    "in particular , we assigned a radius to each particle representing a cluster , and we allowed clusters to merge with each other whenever the distance was smaller than the sum of the radii . in the simulations the imbh is also a particle with a radius set to its schwarzschild radius .",
    "from the individual imbh - cluster simulations presented previously we have data for the outcomes based on the mass ratio @xmath44 , the distance of closest approach between imbh and cluster , and the relative velocity of the two objects and , thus , the change in kinetic energy of the imbh .",
    "we use these results to correct the position and velocity of the imbh after each interaction with a cluster in the simulation of the cc .",
    "this also provides us with information about the number of stellar disruptions triggered by the imbh , as well as the characteristics of the cluster which captures the imbh ( if any ) .",
    "if a capture does occur , the simulation finishes and then we record the position of the `` trapping '' cluster in the cc .",
    "another possible termination of the simulation is if the imbh leaves the cc , because its speed is high enough to escape the complex .",
    "initially we fix the radius of the cc , @xmath45 , to a typical value coming from observational data and populate it with individual clusters following equation [ eq.imfcc ] . in particular , in the `` knots '' of the antenn galaxy one observes a mass distribution with @xmath46 .",
    "the number of _ observed _ individual clusters in ccs is of the order of 100 , but the actual number might actually be thousands , most of which are simply too faint to be observed ( as discussed in e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we set the total mass of the cc to a typical observed value , @xmath47 .",
    "the individual clusters have half - mass radii ranging between 0.5 and 4 pc and are distributed initially in the cc following a plummer model @xcite with a cut off radius ( see table [ tab.powerlaw ] ) .",
    "the masses of the clusters are discrete and come from the @xmath48 ratios that were used in the imbh ",
    "cluster @xmath10body simulations .",
    "then , for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the discrete masses of the clusters in the cc are @xmath51 .",
    "when two clusters collide in the cc simulation , we assume a 20% mass loss , based on the simulations of the collisions of two clusters of @xcite , so the cluster product of the merger of two individual clusters has a mass which is 80% of the sum of the masses and a new radius , equal to the radius of the more massive cluster plus the 20% of the sum of the radii of the two clusters .",
    "the imbh in the merged cluster is assumed to be the product of a merger of two imbhs that were located at the centres of two merging star clusters .",
    "we assume that this happened close to the centre of the cc , where most of the individual cluster - cluster collisions take place , because this is where the numerical density of clusters is highest .",
    "hence , we initially place the imbh at the centre of the cc .",
    "we choose a mass of @xmath52 , which determines the masses of individual clusters from the grid given in the previous section .",
    "the recoil speed of the merged imbh could in principle be up to @xmath53  km  s@xmath54 @xcitefor optimal mass ratios , spins , and spin orientations .",
    "the recoils of greatest interest to our present study are in the @xmath55  km  s@xmath54 range , because the merged imbh will then escape from its host cluster but be bound to the cc as a whole .",
    "it is difficult to judge how representative this will be for the mergers of actual imbhs in ccs . assuming the spin orientations are random , speeds in this range are characteristic of mass ratios @xmath56 for substantial spins , or spins @xmath57 for mass ratios comparable to unity @xcite . for our purposes we will study the case of @xmath58  km  s@xmath54 . at this speed ,",
    "the escape time from a cluster of total radius @xmath59 is @xmath60 .",
    "hence we simply place the imbh initially at the centre of the cc , not bound to any cluster , and assume that it recoils in a random direction .",
    "for the evolution of the recoiling imbh we must take into account the loss of kinetic energy every time it hits a cluster . in figure ( [ fig.histogram ] ) we can see the distribution of the resulting kinetic energy after a hit for all fly - by simulations of figure ( [ fig.outcomes ] ) . while there is a spread in the distribution , there is a strong spike around 10% of loss for about 50% of all simulations .",
    "we have therefore adopted a slightly larger value , of 20% .",
    "this loss of energy will result into a rather negligible deacceleration of the imbh , so that it will have more chances to escape the cc , and it will also lead to a lower number of stellar tidal disruptions . on the other hand , a bit less than 50% of all `` fly - throughs '' have _ at least _ over @xmath61 of relative loss after one hit .",
    "this situation is more appealing from a dynamical standpoint , and therefore we will first address it . in the next sections we will assume an average loss of @xmath62 for the `` fly - throughs '' hits , and in section [ sec.5percent ] we will briefly explore the other situation .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our parameter space consists of the number of clusters @xmath63 and the initial radius of the cc , @xmath45 .",
    "the total mass @xmath64 of the cc is a consequence of @xmath32 , because the masses of the clusters are assumed to follow a power law .",
    "the total radius that we use varies from 45  pc to 330  pc . given the mass and the size of the ccs , the initial escape speeds at the centres of the ccs are between @xmath65 .",
    "all details for all simulations are given in table [ tab.powerlaw ] .",
    "in figure [ fig.results ] we present the results of our 34 cc simulations . in simulations",
    "a1-a5 , b1-b5 , c1-c4 , d1-d4 , e3-e4 , f4 , g4 and h4 the imbh escapes the cc after between zero and a few interactions with clusters .",
    "these cases correspond to smaller - mass ccs or to low initial concentrations . in simulations e1-e2 , f1-f3 , g1-g3 , and h1-h4 , which are more representative of observed ccs , the imbh is captured in the cc after a significant number of interactions and ends up being trapped by an individual cluster , which can be the ucd seed ( cases e1 , e2 , f2 , f3 , and h2 ) .",
    "we show two particular cases which led to the capture of the imbh in figures [ fig.6k_r248_rblue ] and [ fig.5k_r248_rred ] .",
    "the imbh goes through a very large number of interactions with individual clusters until it is eventually trapped .",
    "this number depends on the density of clusters in the cc . in 6 simulations ,",
    "the imbh gets captured by a cluster that has not yet merged with other clusters . in 5 simulations , the cluster that captures the imbh is the central cluster of the cc , the seed ucd .",
    "we show in table [ tab.table1 ] the details about the cluster that captures the imbh , the distance from the centre where this takes place , and the mass of the most massive cluster in the system at the time of the imbh - capture , i.e. , the mass of the ucd seed .",
    "an interesting process in the dynamical evolution of the system is that the imbh triggers stellar collisions , i.e. , stars are set on such an orbit that they collide and disappear from the system .",
    "we note that only in one case , in simulation f1 , one star was torn apart by the tidal forces of the imbh acting on a star .",
    "the middle number next to each circle of figure [ fig.results ] corresponds to star - star _",
    "collisions triggered by the imbh _ in the clusters .",
    "we can conclude that one should expect a star - star collision in a cc every @xmath66 . in figure [ fig.cluster_hits_g3 ]",
    "we show the accumulated number of stellar collisions that led to a disruption in function of the time for simulation g3 , as well as the accumulated number of hits between the imbh and a cluster .",
    "the third number next to each circle of figure [ fig.results ] is the initial escape velocity at the centre of the cc .",
    "as it is obvious , ccs with values @xmath67 retain the imbh due to our choice of the initial recoiling speed .",
    "an interesting case is simulation h4 in which the escape velocity is @xmath68 , but the imbh escapes because the system is initially not very concentrated and the imbh has only 2 interactions with clusters . in this case , the energy of the imbh did not decrease enough to be trapped in the cc .",
    "simulation g3 corresponds to the opposite situation .",
    "even though the escape speed is the same as in h4 , the imbh remains in the system because the cc is denser , so that the imbh has a chance of interacting significantly with clusters and , hence , of decreasing its kinetic energy below the threshold . in figure [ fig.velocities ] we have the evolution of the velocity of the imbh in simulation g3 compared with the escape velocity at the radius of the cc where the imbh is .",
    "initially , the escape velocity is lower than the velocity of the imbh , ensuring the escape of the imbh from the system , but the imbh loses energy rapidly during the first few myr because of its interactions with clusters .",

    "we have reduced the exploration to the range of radii and total mass that could be more interesting for our analysis .",
    "we can see that although the total number of stellar disruptions is signficantly reduced , it is not zero . also , in four configurations the imbh at large is captured eventually by the forming cc .",
    "in this work we have presented results that address the formation of ucd from young clusters , and the role of recoiling imbhs in a cc .",
    "the formation of the imbh in clusters is used as a working hypothesis , and hence also the possibility that these interact with the young clusters . for that , we first ran a set of @xmath182 direct - summation @xmath10body simulations that covers the parameter space for individual imbh  cluster encounters .",
    "we methodically varied the mass ratio between the imbh and the cluster , the relative velocity , and the impact parameter .",
    "this allowed us to build a grid with the expected outcome of the interaction and the modification of the kinetic energy of the imbh .",
    "later we ran additional direct - summation @xmath10body simulations for a scenario in which one imbh is at large in a cc .",
    "the imbh is assumed to be the result of the coalescence of two holes , which led to the expulsion of the hole from the initial host cluster .",
    "we studied the dynamical evolution of this single imbh in an evolving cc .",
    "parallel to the individual interactions between the imbh and clusters in the cc , which are corrected using the above - mentioned table , clusters are colliding and merging with each other , which results in the formation of a run - away individual cluster , which typically after @xmath55 myrs contains almost all of the mass of the cc .",
    "this is what we designate `` the seed of an ultra - compact dwarf galaxy '' , since this very massive cluster is the result of the successive amalgamation of smaller clusters in the initial distribution of the cc .",
    "we find that for realistic ccs ( i.e. those which resemble observations , such as the knots of the antenn ) , the imbh is either eventually captured by the seed ucd ( in those simulations less dense initially ) or by a smaller cluster ( in the simulations with the largest concentrations of clusters at the centre ) which , however , is close to the centre of the cc , so that it will in the course of time sink down to the very centre , where the seed ucd is settled .",
    "the typical timescale for this trapping is of about @xmath183 myr .",
    "we can see this by estimating the dynamical friction time @xmath184 .",
    "this is the timescale for the imbh captured in a cluster to reach the centre . for an object with mass @xmath185 moving in a system of total mass @xmath186",
    "it is given by ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )      where @xmath188 is the distance from the centre of the system , @xmath189 is the root mean square ( rms ) velocity dispersion of the system and @xmath190 the coulomb logarithm , which is of the order of unity . from table",
    "[ tab.table1 ] we can see that in almost half of the cases in which the imbh was retained in the cc , it is captured by the most massive cluster of the system , the seed ucd .",
    "@xmath184 is in all cases a few tens or hundreds of myrs . on the other hand , when the imbh gets captured by a smaller cluster ( 6 out of the 11 simulations ) ,",
    "@xmath184 is of the order of @xmath191 gyr , still well below a hubble time .",
    "we note also that this analytical calculation is an overestimate , because the cc evolves dynamically with time and there is a huge accumulation of mass in the innermost region which will significantly reduce the timescale for the imbh to reach the seed ucd .    when the imbh remains bound to the cc , the average time for it to hit a cluster is @xmath192 . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean time taken by the imbh to fly through a star cluster is of the order of @xmath193 .",
    "hence , after recoiling and before getting captured , the imbh spends @xmath194 of its time interacting with clusters , so that the possibility to find an imbh in a cluster of a newly formed ( less than @xmath195 old ) cc is about @xmath196    we repeated the exercise with a cc harbouring initially 5 and 10 imbhs which were distributed with different velocities . we find that after some @xmath197 myr most of the holes are either captured by a single cluster or have formed a hard binary with one in regions relatively close to the runaway cluster , the seed of a ucd which is forming in the cc . we can not follow the further evolution of the system due to the limitations inherent to our approach .",
    "we also note that gas is very likely to play an important role in the whole process .",
    "in particular , in some ccs the oldest cluster is located at the centre of the gas cloud @xcite . in our simulations we have neglected this , since we are limited by our codes , which rely on pure particle dynamics .",
    "still , even if we could actually have implemented a ( rough ) approach for the gas with an external force , the complexity of the problem justifies our first approach .",
    "we have decided to postpone the role of the gas for upcoming work .",
    "the same applies to mass loss because of stellar evolution , although statistically , since the imbh interacts with clusters of different masses , the global dynamical evolution is well represented by our models , within our limitations .",
    "also , reducing the relative kinetic energy loss for fly - throughs leads to a reduced number of tidal disruption events , but we still find some systems for which the implications are similar to the analysis that used a larger loss .    while the number fraction of imbh in the mass - range of @xmath15 in ccs is an unknown , they sink to the centre in a time which is much shorter than the hubble time . the scenario that we have described here leads to the formation of a very massive black hole at the centre of the ucd , with a mass that depends on unknowns , such as the formation rate of imbhs in the cc .",
    "the internal velocities of the systems we study are not as extreme as those explored by @xcite in the context of hypercompact stellar systems , because the seed ucd inherits the central velocity from the resulting mergers between individual clusters .",
    "when the ucd is formed , the velocity will roughly be what one can expect from a dense stellar system in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "a very interesting feature of the process of sowing an ucd with an imbh is that independently of whether the imbh stays in the cc or escapes , it triggers star - star collisional disruptions in the clusters it hits .",
    "this could be envisaged as an electromagnetic signature of the scenario .",
