    "the analyses described in this paper are based on samples corresponding to luminosity from 0.18 to @xmath2  fb@xmath1 .",
    "the cdf and d   @xmath3 physics programs benefit from production of all species of @xmath3 hadrons at the tevatron collider .",
    "this leads to a possibility of systematic studies of such phenomena as @xmath0 mixing , lifetime difference , rare decays and cp violation .",
    "simultaneous measurements of relevant @xmath4 quantities provide very good opportunities for cross - checks of the results by comparisons with @xmath3 factories  @xcite .",
    "though , there are more and more cases when the tevatron @xmath4 results have comparable or even better precision .",
    "the combined @xmath0 and @xmath4 results tighten the overconstraint of the ckm matrix elements .",

    "time evolution of the neutral @xmath6 systems , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , is described by the schrdinger equation : @xmath9 the mass eigenstates do not coincide with the corresponding flavor states ( see e.g.  @xcite ) : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 .",
    "mass differences between the @xmath12 mass eigenstates can be expressed through off - diagonal elements of the hamiltonian from eq .",
    "[ eq : schrod ] @xmath13 corresponding lifetime differences are @xmath14 the non - zero off - diagonal elements of the hamiltonian lead to a property of @xmath15 and @xmath16 mesons to change flavor and transform into their antiparticles .",
    "this phenomenon is called oscillation or mixing .",
    "the oscillation frequency is proportional to the mass difference @xmath17 .",
    "the phase angle @xmath18 connects the quantities @xmath19 and @xmath20 to the third measurable parameter @xmath21 , which determines cp violation in mixing .",
    "the value @xmath22 is very well measured with the highest accuracy achieved at the babar and belle experiments  @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath23 is expected to be small due to double cabbibo suppression ( @xmath24  @xcite to be compared with the experimental result from babar and delphi : @xmath25  @xcite ) . the sm value @xmath26  @xcite could be enhanced in presence of new physics up to 0.01  @xcite ( updated calculations are in  @xcite ) .",
    "the standard model predictions for these parameters for @xmath0 system are following : @xmath27  ps@xmath1  @xcite , @xmath28  @xcite ( more recent theoretical calculations are available in  @xcite ) and @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "new phenomena could influence differently the @xmath4 and @xmath0 systems .",
    "the @xmath31 measurements are challenging due to high @xmath0 oscillation frequency .",
    "it is about 40 times higher than @xmath32  ps@xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding period of @xmath0 oscillations ( @xmath33  @xmath34 m ) requires to have enough events with the proper decay length resolution of the order of @xmath35  @xmath34 m to resolve these oscillations .",
    "significance of the oscillation signal can be expressed using the following formula  @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of signal ( background ) candidates ; @xmath38 is the tagging efficiency ; @xmath39 is the tagging dilution ; @xmath40 is the decay length resolution ; @xmath41 is the relative momentum resolution .",

    "overall decay length resolution scale factors have been determined using this sample : @xmath59 for @xmath60 of events and @xmath61 for the rest .",
    "simulated events were used to check a dependence of these scale factors from events topologies .",
    "the tagging utilizes information from fragmentation track at the @xmath0 reconstruction side ( same - side tagging ) or tries to determine the @xmath3 flavor at the opposite side through partial reconstruction of its decay products ( opposite - side tagging ) .",

    "the opposite - side tagging has low efficiency but higher dilution .",
