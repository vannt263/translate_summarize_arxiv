    "michael ortiz and coworkers @xcite proposed the use of a vector - valued phase field as a device for describing complex dislocation arrangements .",
    "their model permits to study situations in which multiple slip systems are active , as long as the activity is limited to a single slip plane .",
    "it incorporates both a local peierls interplanar nonconvex potential , which characterizes the discrete nature of slip , and long - range elastic energy .",
    "numerical simulations permitted to identify stable dislocation structures in finite twist boundaries @xcite .",
    "the optimal structures obtained from the simulations exhibit a pattern containing regular square or hexagonal dislocation networks , separated by complex dislocation pile - ups .",
    "the classical analysis of dislocations is based on regularized continuum models , see @xcite .",
    "the need for a regularization arises from the @xmath0-divergence of the strain close to the singularity , and is often implemented either by excluding a small volume around the core or by smoothing the singularity , in both cases on a length scale of the order of the lattice spacing @xmath1 . in reality , in a discrete lattice there is no singularity , and indeed the mathematical analysis of dislocation models has shown that the regularization in continuum models plays the same role as the lattice spacing in discrete ones .",
    "the ortiz phase - field model , as well as the nabarro - peierls model , can be seen as a different way of regularizing linear elasticity .",
    "the nabarro - peierls model is often understood to be a one - dimensional model for straight dislocations , but natural extensions to curved dislocations have permitted to study the energetics of dislocation loops , see for example @xcite .",
    "the mathematical analysis of the phase - field model highlights the occurrence of microstructures over many different length scales .",
    "focusing on the regime where the leading - order contribution to the total energy is given by the dislocation line tension , a number of mathematical papers rigorously characterized the asymptotics of the model within the framework of @xmath2-convergence .",
    "this was started in @xcite for the scalar case in which all dislocations have the same burgers vector , then extended in @xcite to the vectorial situation with multiple slip , and in @xcite to dislocations localized to two parallel planes .",
    "one key result is that straight dislocations with certain burgers vectors and orientations may spontaneously decompose into several parallel dislocations , and in some cases a zig - zag structure is optimal , see @xcite .",
    "these mathematical results gave a rigorous foundation to the classical frank s rule for dislocation reaction @xcite .",
    "a fully three - dimensional discrete model for dislocations and plasticity was proposed by ariza and ortiz @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "their model offers a general framework for dislocations in a lattice , and is amenable to a simple analysis of the continuum limit in situations where fourier methods are appropriate . in the line - tension scaling ,",
    "more complex techniques are however necessary to pass to the continuum limit .",
    "a rigorous derivation of a line - tension model from linear elasticity with core regularization was given in @xcite , an extension to a discrete model of the ariza - ortiz type will appear in @xcite . also in this case , relaxation of straight dislocations may be observed , leading to a line - tension energy which may be smaller @xcite than the one predicted by the classical prelogarithmic factor based on an _ ad hoc _ generalized plane - strain _ ansatz _ @xcite .",
    "energy relaxation by formation of microstructure may be even more relevant in a situation in which one studies the collective behavior of many dislocations .",
    "precisely , one considers a situation in which the total length of the dislocation lines diverges , and one observes a continuous , macroscopic distribution of dislocations . whereas one can estimate the energy of an average dislocation density by adding the energies of the individual dislocations , interaction and relaxation effects may significantly alter the picture .",
    "this is a well - known effect in the phenomenological study of low - angle grain boundaries , see for example @xcite .",
    "we give here a general formulation and a mathematically rigorous treatment .",
    "in particular , we show in section [ sec : cell ] that in specific geometries dislocations with different orientations and burgers vectors may interact , leading in some cases to complex zig - zag patterns .",
    "geometrically , the total ( tensorial ) density of dislocations corresponds to the total incompatibility of the elastic strain field , and therefore to its ( distributional ) curl .",
    "for this reason , the energy of a dislocation density plays a fundamental role in the regularization of models of crystal plasticity , leading to the so - called strain - gradient plasticity models @xcite .",
    "indeed , the presence of large latent hardening renders the variational problem of crystal plasticity , within the deformation theory , nonconvex , leading to lack of existence of minimizers due to the spontaneous formation of fine structure , such as slip bands @xcite , which can again be treated by the theory of relaxation @xcite . the phase - field model by ortiz and coworkers that we study here",
    "was related to strain gradient plasticity in @xcite , where in particular the parameters of continuum strain - gradient plasticity approach were derived from the phase - field dislocation model .",
    "the corresponding process for the forces is the derivation of a continuum approximation for the peach - kohler force , as derived in @xcite .",
    "we remark that in all these works the _ relaxation _ of the dislocation structures , which naturally arises if a mathematically rigorous variational limiting procedure is attempted , is not considered .",
    "strain - gradient plasticity models can be rigorously derived from discrete models , or regularized semidiscrete models , using @xmath2-convergence with a choice of the scaling of the energy which balances the contributions of the elastic field and of the dislocation core energies .",
    "this was performed for the first time for point dislocations in the plane by garroni , leoni and ponsiglione @xcite in a geometrically linear setting with a core regularization approach , and by mller , scardia and zeppieri with a geometrically nonlinear formulation @xcite .",
    "both results rely on a well - separation assumption , which permits to locally estimate the self - energy of each individual dislocation .",
    "the assumption of point dislocations in the plane corresponds to an array of straight parallel dislocations in three dimensions .    in this work",
    ", we derive a strain - gradient model for a density of line dislocations in the plane .",
    "our starting point is the vectorial phase - field model developed by ortiz and coworkers .",
    "our key result is that the energy can be approximated by the sum of two terms , given by the long - range elastic interaction and the self - energy of the dislocation density , see ( [ eqdeffzero ] ) below .",
    "the self - energy itself is determined by solving a cell problem , which corresponds to selecting the energy of the optimal dislocation structure among all those with the same average dislocation density .",
    "in particular , it is in general smaller than the sum of the line - tension energies obtained using individual straight dislocations .",
    "we remark that the key ingredients in this relaxation is the anisotropy of the prelogarithmic factor in the energy of a single , straight dislocation .",
    "higher - order interaction effects may further enrich the picture .",
    "we introduce in section [ sec : model ] the vectorial phase - field model on a torus that we shall use for the rest of the paper and the relevant scaling regime .",
    "the line - tension energy of individual dislocations is discussed in section [ sec : psi ] , and the energy of dislocation structures in section [ sec : cell ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : result ] we present the full limiting model which contains both elasticity and dislocation self - energy .",
    "following ortiz and coworkers @xcite , we study dislocation patterns in the plane , assuming periodicity in the transversal directions . for @xmath3",
    "we consider the domain @xmath4 with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "the ( unrelaxed ) line - tension energy is then @xmath95 where @xmath96 denotes integration along the curve and @xmath79 is the normal vector to the curve .",

    "the three curves have the same start and endpoint as @xmath97 , but are otherwise disjoint , although very close to each other , and have , up to higher order terms , the same length as @xmath97 .",
    "the total energy along these three curves is then only three times the energy of the original curve ( see figure [ fig7]b ) this mathematical observation corresponds to the physically well - known fact that only the shortest lattice vectors are stable burgers vectors of dislocations . in general",
    ", this shows that an effective dislocation energy can be stable with respect to decay into parallel dislocations only if it is subattidive in the first argument , a condition which corresponds to the classical frank s rule for dislocation reactions @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that when we deal with the line tension energy we are considering dislocations at a scale much larger than the lattice spacing , where the core region is identified with a line .",
    "therefore a configuration with a larger total burgers vector , as the one considered in this examples , that might look unphysical , needs to be understood as a cluster of parallel dislocation lines with short burgers vectors .",
    "the energy @xmath105 describes the ( hypothetical ) situation in which the individual lines have a separation of the order of the lattice spacing , so that the total elastic energy of the three dislocations is @xmath106 .",
    "the energy @xmath107 can be achieved if the three dislocations are so close that they can still be identified at a macroscopic scale , but their relative distance is large enough to avoid interaction at the leading order , resulting on an elastic distortion which is the superposition of the effect due to each single dislocation .",
    "if the energy computation were attempted numerically , it would be important that the resolution is high enough to resolve the separation of the curves , i.e. , the microstructure . in doing the relaxation step",

    "( b ) illustrates a blow - up of a small portion of that dislocation , which - in this example - is subdivided into three separate dislocation lines .",
    "these lines are very close on the scale of the sample , so that they are not distinguished in ( a ) , but well separated on the scale of the lattice , so that the total energy is the sum @xmath108 .",

    "for example , a curve with @xmath109 can be replaced by a curve with @xmath110 and another one with @xmath111 , see figure [ fig7]c .",
    "even more , a straight curve may be replaced by a finely - oscillating curve , which has more length but possibly an energetically more convenient orientation ( like in faceting of crystal surfaces ) , see figure [ fig7]d . whether this is energetically convenient depends on the details of the problem , including in particular the orientation of the dislocation line and the material s elastic constants . for a more detailed discussion of these phenomena",

    "we remark that periodicity does not play a role here , as @xmath199 will be used for the local energy in a representative volume element , where the macroscopic slip field is approximately affine with gradient @xmath131 .",
    "the minimization in ( [ eqdefg ] ) is by itself a complex problem , which in general can only be attacked numerically .",
    "the study of efficient tools for this procedure and of possible explicit solutions in special cases constitutes an interesting direction of further work .",

    "typical instances of singular measures are a dirac measure concentrated on a segment , corresponding to the derivative of a discontinuous function , and a measure concentrated on a fractal , such as the cantor set .",

    "we obtain that the self - energy associated with @xmath219 reads @xmath223=\\int_{\\{0<x_1<l/2\\ } } g(a _ * ) dx + 2\\int_{0}^l g(ta_*e_2\\otimes e_1)dt\\,.\\]]we refer to @xcite for further details . the fact that @xmath224 is the relaxation of @xmath225 follows , for example , from the general results on relaxation of @xmath226 functionals in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "in particular , this implies that @xmath224 is lower semicontinuous .",
    "the limiting process discussed above , with subsequent rescalings , can be directly obtained starting from the phase - field model in a suitable scaling regime which permits the total length of the dislocation lines to diverge as @xmath70 . as discussed above ,",
    "we focus on the regime in which the elastic displacement scales as @xmath69 , so that the relevant convergence of displacements is ( see discussion around ( [ eqconvu ] ) ) @xmath227 correspondingly , the energy @xmath228 is assumed to be proportional to @xmath68 .",
    "we will determine the limit ( in the sense of @xmath2-convergence ) of the quotients @xmath229 as in ( [ eqconveeps ] ) .",
    "this scaling was chosen so that the self - interaction leading to line - tension effects balances the macroscopic elastic energy .",
    "the limiting functional is given by the sum of the self - energy and the elastic energy , @xmath230= e_{\\mathrm{\\mathrm{self}}}[u]+\\int_{{\\mathbb{t}}\\times{\\mathbb{t } } } k(z ) ( u(x)-u(x+z))\\cdot(u(x)-u(x+z))\\,dx\\,dz\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath224 defined in ( [ eqdefeself ] ) .",
    "the proof , which is mathematically very technical and builds upon @xmath226 relaxation techniques from @xcite and @xcite and the lower bound for the case of finite dislocation length in @xcite , will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "one key idea is that the self - energy @xmath224 arises from the short - range part of the interaction .",
    "precisely , one can show that , for any @xmath231 , @xmath232\\ , ,   \\end{split}\\ ] ] for an optimal sequence @xmath58 converging to @xmath27 as in ( [ eqconvu2 ] ) .",
    "the fact that the limit does not depend on @xmath233 corresponds to the fact that the line - tension energy @xmath90 , which then originates @xmath137 , @xmath160 and @xmath199 , is localized on a small neighbourhood of the dislocation , whose size is , as @xmath70 , much larger than @xmath1 , but smaller than the ( fixed ) length @xmath233 .    at the same time , the part of the energy with @xmath234 is continuous in the limit , and @xmath235 the proof is based on making these two assertions rigorous , showing that the optimal sequence can be chosen to be the same for both , and taking the limit @xmath236 .",
    "we finally transfer our result back into the 3d setting discussed in the introduction .",
    "let @xmath5 be a deformation , with slip field @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "the self - energy of the slip field is then obtained using the change of variables performed in ( [ eqgammau ] ) to express the slip field in a basis of burgers vectors .",
    "precisely , one obtains @xmath237=\\int_{\\mathbb{t}}f(\\nabla \\gamma ) dx + \\int_{\\mathbb{t}}f(\\frac{dd^s\\gamma}{d|d^s\\gamma|})d|d^s\\gamma|\\ ] ] for @xmath238 , where @xmath239 is defined by the change of variables @xmath240 for any @xmath241 ( here @xmath242 denotes the basis of @xmath14 chosen in ( [ eqgammau ] ) and @xmath243 the canonical basis of @xmath244 ) .",

    "the relevant convergence of the displacement fields is @xmath248 , which implies @xmath249 for the corresponding slip fields .",
    "we remark that , expressed in the physical dislocation density tensor @xmath250 , the self - energy of the networks scales as @xmath251 \\sim \\ln \\frac1{{\\varepsilon}}\\alpha$ ] .",
    "we have discussed a new facet of the phase - field model developed by michael ortiz and coworkers in the 90s , and shown that it permits a rigorous analytical study of dislocation networks in the plane , which accounts for the self - energy of the dislocations and the long - range elastic energy .",
    "we discussed how the effective energy for dislocation microstructures can be computed by solving an appropriate cell problem in each representative volume element .",
    "the analysis of the cell problem itself leads to the prediction , under specific circumstances , of complex dislocation networks in the plane , with interaction between dislocations in different directions , as illustrated in figure [ fig - micro1 ] .",
    "our derivation of the functional @xmath252 supports the use of strain - gradient models in plasticity with linear growth of the strain gradient term , as was done for example in @xcite . at the same time the current derivation adds more details to these models , as the self - energy is rigorously derived from the material properties .",
    "in particular , the cell structure illustrated in figure [ fig - micro1 ] is a direct consequence of the specific form of the self - energy in cubic crystals , and would not appear with the simpler self - energy used in @xcite .",
    "although the framework we formulated is completely general , our specific analysis is restricted to a cubic geometry .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the analysis to the commonly seen dislocation structures , as for example to the geometry appropriate for @xmath253 planes of fcc crystals , which have a triangular structure .",
