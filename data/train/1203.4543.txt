    "use of fossil fuels for satisfaction of current energy needs has an inherent waste product  carbon dioxide . since the beginning of the technological revolution the amount of co@xmath0 released in the atmosphere has grown monotonically , causing a substantial increase of its concentration . within the last decade ,",
    "a significant effort has been expended on identifying ways to avoid co@xmath0 release in the atmosphere , which is the domain of co@xmath0 sequestration .",
    "various geological formations are considered as options for long - term storage of co@xmath0 : depleted oil reservoirs , unmineable coal seams , deep saline aquifers , etc .",
    "the latter are especially promising because they are widespread and have high capacity .",
    "deep aquifers are separated from the shallow freshwater aquifers by caprock  a formation with extremely low permeability ( often shale ) . when co@xmath0 is injected into an aquifer ,",
    "the integrity of the caprock prevents co@xmath0 leakage . however , buildup of the fluid pressure caused by co@xmath0 injection changes the stresses in the caprock , and can lead to reactivation of preexisting faults @xcite or even fracturing of the caprock @xcite .",
    "recent studies have shown that when co@xmath0 is injected at a temperature lower than the ambient temperature of the formation , additional thermal stresses develop around the injection well and the risk of fracturing increases @xcite , @xcite , so that even the caprock can be fractured @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in our recent work",
    "@xcite we revealed two regions of high tensile stresses , where fracturing may occur : ( 1 ) in the immediate vicinity of the injection well , and ( 2 ) above the injection well in the caprock at the boundary with the aquifer .",
    "the first can lead to horizontal fractures in the aquifer , which are of no concern ( and are even beneficial , since they can increase injectivity ) .",
    "the second can lead to short vertical fractures in the caprock .",
    "however , fracturing does not necessarily lead to leakage ; co@xmath0 will leak out of the aquifer only if the fractures are long enough to reach an abandoned well @xcite or connect to a network of natural fractures @xcite .",
    "the initial length of the fractures can be small , e.g. of the order of 10  cm to 10  m @xcite , but under high fluid pressure the fractures may propagate .",
    "therefore , the rate of fracture propagation and the characteristic length of fractures are crucial for assessing the possibility of co@xmath0 leakage from a deep aquifer .",
    "fluid - driven fracture propagation involves multiple physical processes : fracture mechanics , flow in the fracture and flow in the porous aquifer . however , when an aquifer has low permeability , the fluid outflow from it is slow and therefore it is the rate - limiting process for fracture propagation .",
    "therefore , in order to predict the rate of fracture propagation , one has to calculate the outflow ( discharge ) from the aquifer , which can be found from the solution of the pressure equation .",
    "the evolution of pressure takes place in two regions : the aquifer and the propagating fracture .",
    "however , we show here that when the permeability of the aquifer is significantly lower than the permeability in the fracture then it can be assumed that the pressure in the fracture is established instantaneously",
    ". this assumption is used in the hydraulic fracture literature @xcite .",
    "therefore , the pressure diffusion problem can be considered only in the aquifer .",
    "even when considering the pressure diffusion only in the aquifer , the problem is non - trivial , since it is an unsteady problem in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) domain .",
    "we solve the 2d problem numerically and find that after a relatively short time , the solution for the flux is equal to twice the solution of a simplified one - dimensional ( 1d ) problem from the two horizontal flow paths toward the fracture .",
    "the 1d problem can be solved analytically .",
    "the analytical solution for the pressure diffusion problem provides an expression for the fluid flux into the fracture .",
    "then , assuming the khristianovich - geertsma - de klerk ( kgd ) geometry @xcite for the fracture and using the relations for the fracture aperture from @xcite , from the calculated flux we can obtain the fracture length and aperture as a function of time .",
    "using our analytical solution we make estimates based on the parameters for the krechba aquifer ( in salah , algeria ) from @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this site is of significant technological interest because it has been used as a pilot project for co@xmath0 injection since 2004 .",
    "we find that initially the fracture propagation is very fast , similar to the rate of propagation of hydraulic fractures .",
    "our analytical solution predicts fracture propagation of @xmath1 meters within less then a minute after initiation .",
    "on such length scales a fracture may easily reach a leaky fault , a system of natural fractures or an abandoned well and become a pathway for co@xmath0 leakage from the aquifer into potable aquifers or even into the atmosphere .",
    "we also show that the hydrostatic and geostatic effects cause the increase of the driving force for the fracture propagation and , therefore , our solution serves as an estimate from below .",
    "we consider the physical system to consist of a porous aquifer filled with fluid ( brine and injected supercritical carbon dioxide ) and the caprock ( shale ) that constrains the aquifer from above .",
    "we assume that the aquifer has relatively low permeability ( @xmath2 md ) , which is the case , for example , for the sandstone aquifer at the krechba field ( in salah , algeria ) .",
    "injection of cold co@xmath0 leads to a pressure buildup in the aquifer and to tensile stresses in the caprock .",
    "our recent simulations @xcite showed that after several years of continuous injection of cold co@xmath0 the stresses in the caprock above the horizontal injection well exceed the tensile strength of the caprock .",
    "therefore , the caprock fractures .",
    "here we do not discuss the evolution of stresses and initiation of the fracture , since that has been done in ref .",
    "rather , we consider a single vertical 2d fracture originating at the boundary between the 2d aquifer and the caprock , and we assume that the fracture has an elliptical kgd geometry @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; a schematic of the system is represented in figure [ fig : scheme ] .",
    "high pressure in the aquifer pushes the fluid into the fracture , which may cause it to propagate further .",
    "there are several physical mechanisms controlling the behavior of a fluid - driven fracture . for a typical well - driven hydraulic fracturing operation ,",
    "the injected flow rate is high and the fracture propagation rate is limited by two dissipative processes : fracturing of the rock ( controlled by the rock toughness ) and dissipation in the fluid ( controlled by fluid viscosity ) @xcite . however , the case considered here differs substantially .",
    "the source of fluid is the aquifer , which has low permeability , and therefore the outflow of fluid from it is relatively slow .",
    "the rate of fracture propagation can not be faster than the flow of fluid that causes this propagation . since the fluid outflow from the aquifer is the rate - limiting process for the fracture propagation",
    ", it is the only process considered below .    if a fluid - driven fracture propagates in a permeable media , the fluid may seep into the rock through the walls of the fracture .",
    "when the permeability of the rock is high , this effect may noticeably affect the rate of propagation @xcite , but in our case a fracture propagates in shale with typical permeabilities of the order of @xmath3 md @xcite , so the leak - off effects can be neglected .",
    "we denote the fracture length @xmath4 and the aperture ( maximum width ) @xmath5 , which are both functions of time @xmath6 when the fracture propagates .",
    "the time @xmath7 corresponds in our model to the initiation of the fracture , which ( according to @xcite ) may take place after several years of continuous injection of co@xmath0 .",
    "we assume that the initial length of the fracture @xmath8 is negligibly small compared to its length as it propagates .",
    "we denote by @xmath9 the direction into the aquifer , so that @xmath10 is the direction of fracture propagation and @xmath11 denotes the interface between aquifer and caprock . following @xcite",
    "we assume that the fracture is filled with fluid , which originated in the aquifer and flowed into the fracture ; the pressure in the fracture equilibrates instantaneously .",
    "figure [ fig : scheme ] represents the system under consideration .     and @xmath12 ) drives the fracture propagation . ]",
    "we begin with the material balance equation : the rate of change of volume of the fracture @xmath13 is equal to the fluid volumetric flow rate brought from the aquifer , i.e. discharge @xmath14 , @xmath15 the main goal for us is , therefore , to calculate the flux @xmath16 .",
    "once we know it , we can predict how the fracture volume and length change .",
    "the flux @xmath14 can be found from the evolution of pressure @xmath17 in the 2d aquifer with leakage through the opening ; @xmath18 is the horizontal axis , the @xmath9 axis is positive downwards , @xmath19 , @xmath11 correspond to the center of the fracture opening , and the @xmath20 axis is perpendicular to the plane of the image in figure [ fig : scheme ] .",
    "the pressure evolution is governed by a diffusion equation @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the diffusion coefficient for pressure , @xmath23 is the porosity of the aquifer , and @xmath24 is the compressibility of the fluid .",
    "characteristic values of @xmath23 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath24 ( see table [ tab : param ] ) give @xmath27 m@xmath28/s .",
    ".properties of in salah site for co@xmath0 injection [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     [ tab : param ]    since the pressure in the higher permeability fracture is established very fast , we will assume it to be constant along the fracture and equal to the confining stress @xmath29 in the caprock .",
    "therefore , when considering the pressure diffusion problem , the fracture will be represented as a boundary condition for the pressure @xmath30 another boundary condition is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the initial pressure in the aquifer , @xmath33 .",
    "we note that @xmath32 is noticeably higher than the fluid pressure value before the co@xmath0 injection . within these injection years",
    "high pressure propagates from the injection well in the aquifer , and we assume that far from the fracture the pressure remains constant .",
    "then we assume no flux outside the aquifer , except for in the fracture @xmath34 and @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the thickness of the aquifer ( see figure [ fig : scheme ] ) .    for further consideration",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the problem in terms of dimensionless variables .",
    "we use the thickness of the aquifer @xmath36 as a unit of length and @xmath37 as a unit of time .",
    "therefore , we introduce the following dimensionless variables : @xmath38 then we consider the dimensionless pressure @xmath39 therefore , the diffusion problem can be rewritten as :    [ eq : diff2d - dim ] = + + .",

    "an analytical solution of the mixed boundary - value problem [ eq : diff2d - dim ] formulated above is non - trivial and therefore we will solve it numerically . in the initial dimensional formulation we have two characteristic length scales : the fracture aperture @xmath40  m , and the thickness of the aquifer @xmath41",
    "m. hence @xmath42 .",
    "when solving the problem numerically one more length is introduced  the length of the domain @xmath43 ( for the half of the problem , i.e. @xmath44 ) . in order to model an infinite domain , we need @xmath45 , which is typical of the actual physical problem .",
    "the schematic for this problem is shown in the figure [ fig:2d - full ] .     at the boundaries @xmath46 is @xmath47 , the pressure at the fracture opening is @xmath48 , and no - flux conditions",

    "we take @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which will give us characteristic times @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",

    "the numerical solution is performed using dynaflow  a nonlinear transient finite element analysis program @xcite .",

    "<S> deep saline aquifers are promising geological reservoirs for co@xmath0 sequestration if they do not leak . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of leakage is provided by the caprock integrity . </S>",
    "<S> however , co@xmath0 injection operations may change the geomechanical stresses and cause fracturing of the caprock . </S>",
    "<S> we present a model for the propagation of a fracture in the caprock driven by the outflow of fluid from a low - permeability aquifer . </S>",
    "<S> we show that to describe the fracture propagation , it is necessary to solve the pressure diffusion problem in the aquifer . </S>",
    "<S> we solve the problem numerically for the two - dimensional domain and show that , after a relatively short time , the solution is close to that of one - dimensional problem , which can be solved analytically . </S>",
    "<S> we use the relations derived in the hydraulic fracture literature to relate the the width of the fracture to its length and the flux into it , which allows us to obtain an analytical expression for the fracture length as a function of time . using these results we predict the propagation of a hypothetical fracture at the in  salah co@xmath0 injection site to be as fast as a typical hydraulic fracture . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the hydrostatic and geostatic effects cause the increase of the driving force for the fracture propagation and , therefore , our solution serves as an estimate from below . </S>",
    "<S> numerical estimates show that if a fracture appears , it is likely that it will become a pathway for co@xmath0 leakage . </S>"
