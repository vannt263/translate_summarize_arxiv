    "recently , a hierarchy of hubbard - like hamiltonians has been proposed to describe the behavior of ultracold fermions in one - dimensional optical lattices @xcite .",
    "these lattices can be realized with a pair of lasers propagating at a given angle @xmath1 ( @xmath2 represents the familiar counterpropagating case ) , with global confinement ensured by a magnetic trap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] , for a detailed description of this setup see @xcite ) .",
    "the pair of lasers give rise to a interference pattern needed to obtain a periodic potential by ac stark effect .",
    "the lattice constant can be adjusted tuning the angle @xmath1 according to the relation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the laser wavelength .",
    "in addition , it is possible to control both the barrier height of the periodic potential ( as a function of the laser intensity ) and the interaction between fermions via an external magnetic field ( feshbach resonance , see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these simple considerations allow one to understand how ultracold - atoms physics offers the possibility to explore experimentally a wide range of parameters set that would be unattainable in other contexts , such as the hubbard model in condensed matter physics .    as a first step towards the description of the cited models , we propose here a mean - field algebraic approach based on coherent - states procedure @xcite for a fermionic one - dimensional array of harmonic wells .",
    "although the analytical approach followed here may be regarded as completely general , future numerical analysis will concentrate on a dimer with a six - level structure per well as depicted in fig .",

    "the approach followed here allows one a straightforward reformulation of the the usual mean - field approach for quantum system ( based on the ` linearization ' of the hamiltonian and the subsequent solving appropriate self - consistency equations ) in terms of a corresponding classical dynamical system . while , for fermions , the interpretation of the aforementioned classical dynamical system as a semiclassical approximation seems not beyond need of justification , it is possible to give a precise physical interpretation to the dynamical variables of the classical problem in terms of expectation values of quantum operators .    in general",

    "a different choice of @xmath6 will lead to different mean - field solutions ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , we will focus on the so(2r ) coherent states that , as it will be shown , will lead to the hartree - fock - bogoliubov @xcite mean - field approximation , whose effectiveness has been proven for a single spherical harmonic trap in @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : moddesc ] a brief discussion of the general model considered will be given , along with some possible approximations in different physical situations .",
    "as we already mentioned , the fully - analytical control over the physical parameters allows to conceive various hamiltonians that may have direct experimental relevance . in section [ sec : cohst ] so(2r ) coherent states and the relevant algebra will be defined .",
    "the end of this rather technical section will be devoted to the physical interpretation of the choice of so(2r ) as the algebra for the mean - field procedure . in section [ sec : clh ] the classical hamiltonian @xmath7 will be deduced and the functional dependence in terms of quantum operators expectation values will be investigated . finally , in section",

    "we will confine our analysis to situation where radial modes only are involved in the system dynamics ( i.e. we will `` freeze '' the axial quantum number @xmath15 to zero ) .",

    "another assumption concerns the two - body interaction term @xmath22 , which is treated within the pseudopotential approximation , leading to a delta - like spatial dependence , thus excluding nearest - neighbor two - body interaction terms .",
