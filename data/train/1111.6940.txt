    "are sourced by quantum fluctuations formed in scalar fields during an inflationary epoch at very early times .",
    "as the process describing the decay of these scalar fields into standard matter is not known , we map the power spectrum of the field fluctuations onto the spectrum of a conserved quantity when the size of the fluctuations is similar to the size of the hubble radius , that is at horizon crossing , @xmath0 , ( see e.g.  refs .",

    "the relative size of a given field fluctuation compared to the hubble radius ( @xmath1 ) is important .",
    "perturbations arising from fluctuations in the inflaton scalar field will become fixed , or are `` frozen in '' , when that scale first leaves the hubble radius .",
    "they will be conserved while that mode is beyond the hubble radius if mapped to a suitable quantity like a curvature perturbation , such as those discussed in the following .",

    "planck we expect to do even better .",
    "hence it is essential that the quantities we wish to study in the early universe are understood , theoretically , to this same level of precision .",
    "it is well known that the curvature perturbations on both uniform density hypersurfaces , @xmath2 , and on comoving hypersurfaces , @xmath3 , are conserved on large scales where gradient terms can be neglected ( i.e. in the limit @xmath4 ) for adiabatic perturbations , refs .",
    "this result follows from the conservation of energy , ref .",
    "the standard approach used to calculate the power spectrum of perturbations after horizon crossing assumes that the limit @xmath5 has been reached , see ref .",

    "as we do not want to rely on the slow roll approximation or the large scale limit , we solve the klein - gordon equations numerically , having chosen a particular scalar field potential .",
    "the linear scalar field perturbations are evolved from an initial bunch - davies state well inside the horizon until the inflationary expansion ends .",
    "most of the results we present in this paper use single field chaotic inflation , the simplest single field inflation model which is in agreement with wmap7 . in order to ensure that our results are representative beyond this simplest model , we also study a set of more complicated single field models , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",

    "the evolution , or indeed conservation , of the curvature perturbations has been studied in detail in the past , see ref .",
    "@xcite and , as expected , we find that some time shortly after horizon crossing there is no longer any appreciable evolution in either the power spectrum of @xmath2 , @xmath71 or the power spectrum of @xmath3 , @xmath72 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1a ] .",
    "the values of these power spectra converge very quickly onto the same conserved value .",

    "[ fig:1b ] which shows the non - adiabatic pressure perturbation , @xmath10 .",
    "we find , again as expected , that during and after horizon crossing the size of @xmath10 drops sharply towards zero .",
    "the non - adiabatic pressure perturbation is directly related to the curvature perturbation ( on large scales ) , see ref .",
    "@xcite  , and",
    "hence the rapid decrease in the non - adiabatic pressure perturbation causes the curvature perturbations to settle onto a conserved value .",
    "however , it can also be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:1a ] that there is some evolution of the power spectra immediately after horizon crossing .",
    "this is well known in the literature where the phrase ` soon after horizon crossing ' is commonly used to refer to the time at which the power spectra have settled down . in the sections that follow we will be looking at this evolution in more detail and in particular quantifying exactly how soon after horizon crossing the power spectra reach the final value and how different this is to the horizon crossing values .",
    "the curvature perturbation on uniform density hypersurfaces , @xmath2 and the comoving curvature perturbation , @xmath3 are often used interchangeably .",
    "although they have different definitions , see eq .",
    "( [ defzeta ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ defr ] ) , it is well known that on large scales they are equivalent , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "this equivalence is however only strictly true in the large scale limit , and on smaller , finite scales this is not the case . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1a ] we see that there is a difference between the two curvature perturbations near to horizon crossing .",
    "three different @xmath42-modes are plotted throughout there evolution , from deep within the horizon through horizon crossing ( indicated by the dotted lines ) , until the end of inflation .",
    "[ fig : zetaoverr ] shows that @xmath2 is as much as 20% larger than @xmath3 at horizon crossing and remains significantly larger for at least a couple of efolds .",

    "however , it is not clear exactly how much of an error would be incurred if one would use the horizon crossing values instead of the correct values at the end of inflation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pcchange ] we can see exactly how different the power spectra are at horizon crossing compared to the values they take at the end of inflation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pcr ] @xmath72 is 100% larger at horizon crossing and in fig .",
    "[ fig : pczeta ] @xmath71 is 180% larger .",
    "in fact if we use an analytic approximation that does take into account the pre horizon behaviour we can see the 100% difference in the power spectra .",

    "a few e - folds later , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "this is a drop of 1 .",
    "hence the power spectra at horizon crossing is expected to be roughly 100% larger than that at late times .",
    "the factor of two difference in @xmath72 , has previously been found analytically , for example ref .",
    "@xcite this is , however , a large difference and might impact on calculations if @xmath79 is used to approximate the value of the power spectra at the end of inflation .",
    "the expressions `` soon after horizon crossing '' and `` a few efolds after horizon crossing '' are often used in the literature to determine when it is reasonable to evaluate the power spectra , so that one can be confident that they have the same value as at the end of inflation .",
    "now that we have established that the values at horizon crossing can be as much as 180% greater than those at the end of inflation we can study exactly how long after horizon crossing we must wait until the power spectra converge onto these final values .",

    "the choice of potential makes very little difference to the result .",

    "( [ prest2 ] ) . as we mentioned in section",
    "[ sec : introduction ] , it is often not made explicitly clear in the literature when the mixing of late time solution and horizon crossing values is being used , even when this is well understood by the authors . in fig .",

    "[ fig : compare ] , as expected , the correct analytic solution gives a very good estimate to the full numerical solution .",
    "even the analytic solution without the slow roll correction , given in eq .",
    "( [ prest1 ] ) , is a very good estimate to the full solution , in fact the error in not including the slow roll corrections for the wmap scale is only a slight underestimate of 0.38% .",
    "however , when we compare the numerical solution to @xmath72 evaluated at horizon crossing we find , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig : pcr ] that there is a 100% error in our answer . as we have shown earlier in fig .",
    "[ fig : pczeta ] , if we evaluated the @xmath71 at horizon crossing the error would be even higher at 180% , this difference in the two power spectra can be seen clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] .",
    "this again highlights the importance of establishing that the correct analytic expression is used in calculations , and when different calculations and results are compared .",
    "another possible source of error would be to use the analytic expression given in eq .",
    "( [ prest2 ] ) above , but not to evaluate it at horizon crossing . if one were to evaluate this expression ` some efolds after horizon crossing ' , one would underestimate the amplitude of the power spectrum .",
    "this corresponds to following the red line in fig .",
    "[ comparepic2 ] .",
    "for example , evaluating eq .",
    "( [ prest2 ] ) 4 efolds after horizon crossing would incur an error of 15% . furthermore , evaluating the power spectrum at later and later times will increase the error .",
    "lastly , it is worth noting that although the analytic and numerical expressions agree in the large scale limit , they do not agree with each other shortly after horizon crossing .",
    "as shown in the section above one must wait at least 3.2 efolds for these two values to agree .",
    "this is particularly important if there is a second phase of evolution caused for example by a second scalar field which starts to dominate during these three efolds , see for instance ref .",

    "the lines in this graph are shown for the mode @xmath65 which is the wmap pivot scale.,width=302 ]    using observations we can gain information about the power spectrum of curvature perturbations , which in turn allows us to constrain cosmological theories .",
    "many observational results are given in terms of a few observables which can then be compared directly with predictions given by theories , one such observable is the spectral index .",
    "the spectral index describes the scale dependence of the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation and is defined by @xcite n _ - 1 , n _ - 1 .    as an example of how the results presented in this paper will impact on particular observables we consider the spectral index in more detail , we present results here using chaotic inflation .",
    "figure [ fig : spectral ] shows , as expected , that just like the curvature perturbation the spectral index continues to evolve for a few efolds after the mode has crossed outside the horizon . evaluating the spectral index naively at horizon crossing gives a results of @xmath82 and @xmath83 , which is an error in both cases of more than 100% .",
    "we find that in order for @xmath81 and @xmath84 to be within 1% of their values at the end of inflation , we should evaluate them at least 2.91 and 2.66 efolds after horizon crossing , respectively .",
    "these values are similar but slightly less than the number of efolds it takes for the power spectrum to be within 1% of it s final value , see table 1 .",
    "in this paper we have quantified the evolution of the curvature perturbations after inflation and highlighted possible errors which can occur . as we are entering an era where we can hope to constrain cosmological parameters to within a percent using the observational data from e.g.  planck , it is of particular importance that these errors are both minimised and quantified .    after presenting the evolution equations for the scalar field",
    ", we gave the expressions for the curvature perturbations we consider .",
    "we then outlined the numerical methods used to solve these equations and gave details of the various models and the initial conditions used . in presenting our results",
    ", we found that despite @xmath2 and @xmath3 being equivalent very far outside the horizon , the difference between @xmath85 and @xmath86 at horizon crossing can be as much as 20% .",
    "we also found the error in evaluating the power spectra numerically at horizon crossing instead of either using the correct analytic expression or the full numerical solution at late times can be as much as 180% for @xmath71 and 100% for @xmath87 .",

    "there was no significant difference to these results when we considered the three additional single field models presented at the end of section [ sec : numerical ] .    in this paper",
    "we point out that there is a difference between analytic and numerical expressions close to the horizon .",
    "this is due to the fact that the long wavelength approximation is not valid immediately on horizon crossing .",
    "that is , there are terms in the analytical solution involving gradients that are non - negligible on horizon crossing . these become negligible rapidly , and after around 3 e - folds the exact numerical solution agrees with the long - wavelength analytical approximations .",
    "furthermore , from fig .",
    "[ comparepic2 ] , we can see that these corrections are not due to the break in slow roll ( since the two analytical estimates are roughly the same ) , but that this difference really arises due to the invalidity of the long wavelength approximation on horizon crossing .",
    "the numerical results are the instantaneous values of the power spectrum and spectral index at horizon crossing , not the expected late time values .",
    "these instantaneous results , while not of observational significance , are useful in many ways , including as initial conditions for other analytical or numerical schemes which operate purely outside the horizon .",
    "firstly , if we are interested in the late time values we should not take the ` nave ' numerical approach of evaluating these at horizon crossing .",
    "unlike the case when using the analytic expressions these results will not be close to the correct answer . secondly , if we are interested in the instantaneous values at or close to horizon crossing , for instance when developing codes which rely on this information , the normal analytic expressions will not give the correct answers as they are no longer valid and you need to use numerical methods .    in this paper",

    "we have chosen the end of inflation as a natural end point of our calculations .",
    "after the end of inflation the inflaton is assumed to decay into the standard matter fields during reheating , the detailed mechanism of which is as yet unclear . also ,",
    "after reheating we have a multi - fluid system , and hence automatically @xmath89 , see ref .",

    "<S> how much does the curvature perturbation change after it leaves the horizon , and when should one evaluate the power spectrum ? to answer these questions we study single field inflation models numerically , and compare the evolution of different curvature perturbations from horizon crossing to the end of inflation . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we calculate the number of efolds it takes for the curvature perturbation at a given wavenumber to settle down to within a given fraction of their value at the end of inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that e.g.  in chaotic inflation , the amplitude of the comoving and the curvature perturbation on uniform density hypersurfaces differ by up to 180 % at horizon crossing assuming the same amplitude at the end of inflation , and that it takes approximately 3 efolds for the curvature perturbation to be within 1 % of its value at the end of inflation . </S>"
