    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has been extensively tested by many independent experiments and the results are in agreement with the predictions of the sm . the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern",
    "is designed to explore the energy and intensity frontier which could show physics beyond the sm .",
    "the initial results released by the atlas and cms experiments not only confirm the predictions of the sm , including the discovery of the higgs boson @xcite , but have also started pushing the energy scale required by new physics models including exotic fermions and gauge bosons which are not present in the sm . among exotic fermions one possible new particle is a spin@xmath0 excitation of quarks .",
    "we will assume this spin@xmath0 particle to be a color triplet like an ordinary quark and consider the pair production and the decay of such an exotic particle at the lhc .",
    "it is not outside the realm of possibility that a spin@xmath0 quark could exist as a fundamental particle .",
    "we could also have spin@xmath0 bound states of ordinary quarks with gluons or the higgs boson .",
    "there are also theoretical models in which spin@xmath0 quarks arise as bound states of three heavy quarks for sufficiently strong yukawa couplings @xcite .",
    "the masses of these bound states are typically expected to be a few tev .",
    "a heavy spin@xmath0 quark could also exist as the lightest regge recurrences of light spin@xmath7 quarks or as kaluza - klein modes in string theory if one or more of the compactification radii is of the order of the weak scale rather than the planck scale and such weak compactification in the framework of both string theory and field theory has been popular @xcite . in this work",
    "we restrict ourselves to the collider production of point - like spin@xmath0 color triplet quarks .",
    "the production of spin@xmath0 quarks by hadronic collisions has been previously considered by moussallam and soni @xcite and by dicus , gibbons , and nandi @xcite .",
    "there are several studies on production of spin@xmath8 fermions at lepton colliders @xcite and also the virtual effects of such particles on @xmath9 production @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : frules ] , we give the feynman rules relevant for the production of spin@xmath0 quarks . in section [ sec : cross ] , we give the explicit analytic formulae for the squares of the amplitude , various subprocess cross sections and total production cross sections . in section",

    "a redefinition of the spin@xmath0 field @xmath18 allows one to remove the @xmath16 dependent terms in the propagator @xcite .",

    "@xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 represent the respective pdf s for partons ( quark , antiquark and gluons ) in the colliding protons , while @xmath61 is the factorization scale . in fig.[prodfig ] we plot the leading - order production cross section for the process @xmath62 at center of mass energies of 7 , 8 and 14 tev as a function of the spin@xmath8 quark mass @xmath10 .     at the lhc as a function of spin@xmath8 quark mass @xmath10 at center - of - mass energies , @xmath63 and @xmath6 tev .",
    "we have chosen the scale as @xmath64 , the mass of the spin@xmath8 quark.__,width=326 ]    we set the factorization scale @xmath61 equal to @xmath10 , and used the cteq6@xmath651 parton distribution functions @xcite .",
    "this production cross section is larger than any spin-@xmath7 colored fermion of same mass such as a fourth - generation quark or an excited quark .",
    "this is not unexpected , as the cross section given in eq.([eq : gg2qqbar ] ) grows with energy as @xmath66 which violates unitarity at high energies .",
    "we assume that the interactions given in sec.ii represent an effective interaction such that , at higher energies , higher order contributions will be important and the cross section will be damped by some form factors dependent on the scale of the new physics .",
    "some explicit ways to address this have been discussed in refs.@xcite .",
    "there is some natural enhancement , however , because the particles carry additional spin degree of freedom when compared to spin-@xmath7 fermions .",
    "we find that for the 7 tev run of the lhc , the pair production of a colored spin@xmath8 exotic fermion has cross sections in excess of a few hundred femtobarns ( fb ) for masses as high as 600 gev . at the current run of the lhc , with a center of mass energy of 8 tev , cross",
    "sections in excess of 100 fb are obtained for masses up to 750 gev .",
    "therefore a strong case can be made to search for such exotics in the current and upcoming lhc data , just as that being done for coloron like particles .",
    "any search for these exotics would crucially depend on how the particle decays and what is produced in the final state so let us now discuss how these particles will decay .",
    "higher dimension - five operators would lead to interactions between the massive spin@xmath8 states and the spin@xmath7 states such as @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 represents the field tensor of the gauge field and @xmath69 is the spin@xmath7 fermion .",
    "@xmath70 determines the scale of some new physics which , for example , could be the scale which remedies the unitarity violation seen in the cross section .",
    "note that large values of scale @xmath70 would imply that the interaction strength weakens .",
    "we will assume that the colored spin@xmath8 will decay promptly to a gluon and a spin@xmath7 fermion ( which in our case is a sm quark ) with 100% branching probability .",
    "so there is no need for us to calculate a branching ratio and thus no need to use eq.([dim5 ] ) .",
    "the only thing we need is for @xmath70 to be large enough such that eq.([dim5 ] ) does not change the production cross section significantly .",
    "thus if the quantum numbers dictate a decay to a particular family of quarks we can have three different scenarios corresponding to the decay of the spin@xmath8 particle to one of the three sm quark families , a light sm quark and a gluon ( @xmath71 ) , or a heavy quark and a gluon ( @xmath72 or @xmath73 ) .",
    "we will now analyze each of these signals and the corresponding sm background representative of the type of decay .",
    "as mentioned above we assume that the spin@xmath8 colored fermion can decay to a sm quark and a gluon .",
    "if the quark happens to belong to the first two families of the sm quarks , then these quarks will hadronize and form jets , as will the gluons , leading to four jets in the final state .",
    "all the jets will carry large transverse momenta ( @xmath74 ) as they are byproducts of a heavy particle decay .",
    "however , with final states only comprised of jets the signal will be overwhelmed by the huge qcd background which would also be characterized by high @xmath74 jets . therefore to extract the signal from the huge    .__the signal cross section for the @xmath3 final state coming from the pair production of spin@xmath8 quarks of mass m with @xmath75 tev as the cut on the transverse momenta of the jets is varied .",
    "also shown is the qcd background which has been estimated using ` m`adgraph 5 @xcite . _ _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this work we have focused on the signals for colored spin@xmath8 fermions at the lhc .",
    "these particles will have large production cross sections and can be discovered through resonances in different channels depending on their decay properties .",
    "we have presented complete analytic expressions for the parton - level matrix amplitudes and cross sections used in our calculations .",
    "we considered three different scenarios for the higher spin fermion mixing with sm quarks which dictates the decay modes .",
    "we find that such an exotic fermion can decay hadronically to two light jets or into a gluon and heavy quark flavors .",
    "this leads to three different final state topologies @xmath3 , @xmath76 and",
    "@xmath1 . we did a detailed analysis of the three different cases and show that a strong cut on the transverse momenta of the final state jets is very useful in suppressing the otherwise large qcd background for hadronic final states at lhc .",
    "we have compared our results with a cms study on @xmath3 final states and extracted a lower bound of 490 gev on the spin@xmath8 quark mass .",
    "we further showed that this reach can be improved by using stronger cuts on the @xmath74 of the jets ; the details are given in table [ tab:4j ] .",
    "given that only a limited amount of luminosity will be collected at @xmath77 tev the reach in @xmath10 for this final state is between @xmath78 gev and @xmath79 gev . at @xmath80 tev the reach easily exceeds @xmath81 tev .",
    "we then considered the case where the spin@xmath8 quark decays to a gluon and a bottom quark and showed , in figs .",
    "[ fig : minvj1b1 ] and [ fig : minvj2b1 ] , that the event characteristics of such a final state leads to a clear invariant mass peak when the @xmath82-jet is paired with the gluon jets .",
    "we also showed , in table [ tab:2b2j ] , that the sm background is suppressed in this final state which would lead to a better reach for spin@xmath8 quark mass .",
    "finally we focused on the signal where the spin@xmath8 quark decays to a top quark and gluon where the signal and background are shown , for nominal cuts , in table [ tab : ttjj ] .",
    "the background for a top pair with two additional radiated gluons is seen to be large . however , as shown in table [ tab:2l2b2j ] , this background can be greatly reduced by appropriate cuts which include a strong @xmath74 requirement on the jets . for @xmath80 tev these cuts extend the observation reach to @xmath83 gev .",
