    "searching for high - energy tau neutrinos ( @xmath7 gev ) will yield quite useful information about the highest energy phenomenon occurring in the universe @xcite . the same search may also provide evidence for physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "the latter is suggested by the recent measurements of the atmospheric muon neutrino deficit , though yet there is no observation of oscillated atmospheric tau neutrinos at a significant confidence level @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it is also only recently that we have the first evidence of existence of tau neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the high - energy tau neutrinos can be produced in @xmath8 and @xmath9 interactions taking place in cosmos .",
    "these interactions produce unstable hadrons that decay into tau neutrinos . in this paper",
    ", we mainly concentrate on @xmath8 interactions and will only briefly comment on @xmath9 interactions as source interactions for producing high - energy tau neutrinos .",
    "there can be several astrophysical sites where the @xmath8 interactions may occur .",
    "examples of these include the relatively nearby and better known astrophysical sites such as our galaxy and the earth atmosphere , where the basic @xmath8 interactions occur as @xmath10 interactions .",
    "the @xmath8 interactions in these sites form a rather certain background to the extra - galactic high - energy tau neutrino searches .",
    "it is possible that such interactions are the only sources of high - energy tau neutrinos should the search for high - energy tau neutrinos originating from several proposed distant sites such as agns , grbs , as well as groups and clusters of galaxies , turns out to be negative .",
    "therefore , it is rather essential to investigate the high - energy tau neutrino flux expected from our galaxy and the earth atmosphere .",
    "both the galactic and atmospheric tau neutrinos can be categorized into intrinsic and oscillated ones . here",
    ", intrinsic @xmath1 flux refers to the @xmath1 produced directly by an interaction while oscillated @xmath1 refers to the @xmath1 resulted from the @xmath11 oscillation .",
    "presently , there exists no estimate for the intrinsic high - energy @xmath1 flux originating from our galaxy in @xmath8 interactions , although the estimates for @xmath12 and @xmath3 fluxes due to the same interactions are available @xcite . in this work",
    ", we calculate the intrinsic @xmath1 flux from our galaxy by using the perturbative and nonperturbative qcd approaches to model the @xmath8 interactions , and taking into account all major tau neutrino production channels up to @xmath13 gev .",
    "we note that the production of tau neutrinos in the terrestrial context was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which uses a nonperturbative qcd approach for @xmath8 interactions . to calculate the oscillated galactic and atmospheric @xmath1 fluxes , we apply the two - flavor neutrino oscillation analysis @xcite .",
    "it is essential to compare the above galactic tau neutrino flux with the flux of atmospheric tau neutrinos .",
    "the intrinsic atmospheric tau neutrino flux has been calculated for @xmath14 gev @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we extend the calculation up to @xmath13 gev .",
    "such an extension requires the input of cosmic - ray flux spectrum for an energy range beyond that considered in ref .",
    "furthermore , for a greater neutrino energy , the solutions of cascade equations relevant to the neutrino production behave differently .",
    "for the oscillated @xmath1 flux , it is interesting to note that the oscillation length for @xmath15 for the energy range @xmath0 is much greater than the thickness of the earth atmosphere .",
    "hence the oscillated atmospheric @xmath1 flux in this case is highly suppressed .",
    "one may argue that the interaction of the high - energy cosmic - rays with the ubiquitous cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons present in cosmos ( @xmath9 rather than @xmath8 interactions ) could also be an important source for high - energy astrophysical tau neutrinos .",
    "the center - of - mass energy ( @xmath16 ) needed to produce a @xmath17 lepton and a @xmath18 is at least @xmath19 1.8 gev . in a collision between a proton with an energy @xmath20 and a cmb photon with an energy @xmath21 ,",
    "the center - of - mass energy squared of the system satisfies @xmath22 .",
    "since the peak of the cmb photon flux spectrum with a temperature @xmath19 2.7 k is at about @xmath23 ev , it requires a very energetic proton with @xmath24 gev in order to produce a @xmath25 pair .",
    "thus , the contribution of the intrinsic tau neutrino flux from the interaction between the cosmic proton and the cmb photon is negligible , unless we are considering extremely high - energy protons , beyond the presently observed highest energy cosmic - rays @xcite . to compute the oscillated @xmath1 flux in this case ,",
    "we consider the non - tau neutrino flux generated by the @xmath26 interaction via the @xmath27 resonance , commonly referred to as the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff interaction , which assumes that the proton travels a cosmological distance @xcite .",
    "a recent calculation of the intrinsic non - tau gzk neutrino flux indicates that this flux peaks typically at @xmath28 gev @xcite , beyond the reach of presently operating high - energy neutrino telescopes such as amanda and baikal experiments @xcite .",
    "this flux decreases for @xmath29 gev .",
    "in fact , it falls below the intrinsic non - tau galactic - plane neutrino flux for @xmath30 gev .",
    "the neutrino flavor oscillations of the intrinsic non - tau gzk neutrinos into tau neutrinos result in a @xmath1 flux comparable to the original non - tau neutrino flux @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the absence ( or smallness ) of tau neutrino flux from other possible extra - galactic astrophysical sites , the only source of high - energy tau neutrinos besides the atmospheric background is from our ( plane of ) galaxy , typically for @xmath31 .",
    "this is an energy range to be explored by the above high - energy neutrino telescopes in the near future .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the calculation of intrinsic high - energy tau neutrino flux from our galaxy , including the description of the flux formula , the galaxy model , and the various tau neutrino production channels taken into account in the calculation . although this flux will be shown small , we shall go through some details of the calculation since they are also useful for the calculation in the next section . in section iii ,",
    "we present our result on the intrinsic atmospheric @xmath1 flux and compare it with the galactic one . in section iv , we discuss the effects of neutrino flavor mixing , which are used to construct the oscillated @xmath1 fluxes from the galaxy and the earth atmosphere respectively . the total galactic @xmath1 flux ( the sum of intrinsic and oscillated fluxes ) is compared to its atmospheric counterpart , and the dominant energy range for the former flux is identified .",
    "we also mention the currently envisaged prospects for identifying the high - energy tau neutrinos .",
    "we summarize in section v.",
    "we use the following formula for computing the @xmath1 flux : @xmath32 in the above equation , @xmath33 is the tau neutrino energy and the cosmic - ray flux spectrum , @xmath34 , is given by @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 gev and @xmath34 is in units of @xmath37 s@xmath38 sr@xmath38 gev@xmath38 .",
    "we assume directional isotropy in @xmath34 for the above energy range .",
    "the function @xmath39 is equal to @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the @xmath8 interaction length and @xmath42 is a representative distance in the galaxy along the galactic plane .",
    "the target particles are taken to be protons with a constant number density of 1 @xmath43 and @xmath42 is taken to be @xmath44 kpc , where 1 pc @xmath45 @xmath46 cm .",
    "the @xmath47 is the total inelastic @xmath8 cross section .",
    "since the high - energy protons traverse a distance @xmath42 much shorter than the proton interaction length , the proton flux spectrum @xmath48 is assumed to be constant over the distance @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , we calculate the intrinsic tau neutrino flux along the galactic plane only to obtain the maximal expected tau neutrino flux .",
    "the matter density decreases exponentially in the direction orthogonal to the galactic plane , therefore the amount of intrinsic tau neutrino flux decreases by approximately two orders of magnitude for the energy range of our interest . for further details ,",
    "see ingelman and thunman in ref .",
    "the function @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ aa ] ) basically gives the number of inelastic @xmath8 collisions in the distance @xmath42 , while the distribution @xmath49 is the differential cross section normalized by @xmath50 , i.e. , @xmath51 the above distribution gives the fraction of inelastic @xmath8 interactions that goes into @xmath1 s .",
    "we can now simplify eq .",
    "( [ aa ] ) into @xmath52 it is clear that the task of computing @xmath53 relies on the evaluation of the differential cross section @xmath54 in @xmath8 interactions . in this work , we include all major production channels of tau neutrinos , namely , via the @xmath55 meson , @xmath56-hadron , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . in general , the symbol @xmath1",
    "shall be used to account for the contribution of @xmath1 and @xmath60 unless otherwise mentioned .",
    "we note that the heavy intermediate states , such as the @xmath61 meson , @xmath56-hadrons and other heavier states , decay ( into @xmath1 ) before they interact with other particles in the galactic plane .",
    "this is due to the rather small matter density of the medium and the large distance between the proton source and the earth . before we proceed ,",
    "let us remark that the intrinsic tau neutrino production by the galactic @xmath9 interactions is suppressed relative to that in the galactic @xmath8 interaction , because @xmath62 for the energy range of interest to us @xcite .",
    "the lightest meson that can decay into a @xmath17-@xmath63 pair is the @xmath55 meson .",
    "it was pointed out that the production and the decay of @xmath55 meson is the major production channel for tau neutrinos in the agn @xcite .",
    "we expect the same will be true for galactic tau neutrinos .",
    "the @xmath55 meson decays into a charged @xmath17 lepton and a @xmath63 .",
    "the charged @xmath17 lepton subsequently decays into the second @xmath63 plus other particles , which can be one prong or three prong .",
    "the kinematics of the @xmath17 lepton decay is treated by the monte carlo technique . for simplicity , we assume that the @xmath17 lepton decays into a @xmath63 and a particle @xmath64 with the mass @xmath65 satisfying @xmath66 . consequently , the second @xmath63 is much more @xmath67 than the first one because the @xmath55 mass is only slightly larger than @xmath68 .",
    "we take the branching ratio @xmath69 as @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the production of @xmath55 mesons . here , we employ two approaches to calculate the production of @xmath55 mesons : ( i ) the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) and ( ii ) the quark - gluon string model ( qgsm ) . in the pqcd approach ,",
    "we use the leading - order result for @xmath71 : @xmath72 where @xmath73 are the parton distribution functions ( we use the cteqv5 @xcite ) , while the parton subprocesses are @xmath74 .",
