    "cu@xmath2bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is the first superconductor emerging from a three dimensional topological insulator ( ti).@xcite as a bran - new superconducting ( sc ) material with topologically nontrivial normal state , it has been suspected to be a time reversal invariant ( tri ) topological superconductor ( tsc ) , which supports andreev bound states ( abs ) on the surface.@xcite the surface abs in tscs are massless majorana fermions , which are novel particles identical to their antiparticles and are under intensive search also because of their prospect of application in topological quantum computing.@xcite    based on a phenomenological on - site attractive interaction , fu and berg indeed find some triplet pairings that support surface abs in cu@xmath2bi@xmath0se@xmath1.@xcite subsequent point contact spectroscopy experiments observed zero bias conductance peaks ( zbcps ) , providing smoking - gun evidence for the existence of surface abs.@xcite though recently there are reports advocating conventional @xmath3 wave pairing@xcite , the majority of experiments are indicating the unconventional nature of the pairing in cu@xmath2bi@xmath0se@xmath1.@xcite for examples , a specific heat measurement on one hand suggests a fully gapped pairing while on the other hand is not in full agreement with bcs prediction.@xcite meissner effect measurements show an unusual field dependence of the magnetization , which is argued to be consistent with odd - parity spin triplet pairing.@xcite upper critical field measurements show the absence of pauli limiting effect , contrary to conventional isotropic s wave pairings , pointing to a very likely triplet pairing.@xcite    there are definitely more works needed to identify the genuine pairing symmetries of cu@xmath2bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and the pressure induced sc state of bi@xmath4te@xmath5 and bi@xmath4se@xmath5.@xcite one important question , which is by and large disregarded up to now , is the possible relevance of anisotropic spin singlet pairings to these new superconductors.@xcite since the anisotropic spin singlet parings are more commonly realized than triplet pairings among all unconventional superconductors , including the well - known cuprates and iron pnictides , it is highly desirable to explore this possibility . in this direction , one interesting open question",
    "is whether a possible anisotropic spin singlet paring can support surface abs that could give a zbcp in point contact spectra and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments . since the observation of zbcp is considered to be a clear indication of possible unconventional pairing , it is very important to identify theoretically this possibility .",
    "the above topic is interesting also in the symmetry classification of superconductors .",
    "since spin - orbit interaction is important for bi@xmath0x@xmath1 ( x is se or te ) , tri pairings all belong to the diii symmetry class.@xcite in this symmetry class , while known topologically nontrivial pairings are all spin triplet@xcite , it is unclear if spin singlet pairings can also have nontrivial topological properties .",
    "the present system of bi@xmath0x@xmath1 provides a good candidate to explore this possibility . in the work presented below",
    "we show that , when anisotropic pairing is considered , two interorbital singlet pairings give zero energy surface states and hence zbcp in point contact spectra and stm experiments .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we construct a tight binding model by using group theory and mapping to an existing minimal model defined close to the brillouin zone ( bz ) center",
    ". then we analyze the possible anisotropic spin singlet pairings from purely symmetry considerations , with an antiferromagnetic exchange term in the mind as a phenomenological mechanism for giving these pairings .",
    "the gap structures and spectral properties of the various pairings are then analyzed in detail . in sec .",
    "iii , we start from a purely repulsive short range coulomb interaction and derive the dominant superexchange channels relevant to bi@xmath4se@xmath5 and bi@xmath4te@xmath5 .",
    "then a self - consistent mean field calculation in terms of a @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8@xmath7@xmath9@xmath7@xmath10 model is performed , which shows that the actual pairing is always a mixture of several components of the anisotropic singlet pairings identified in sec .",
    "ii . in sec . iv , we discuss the implications of our work for experiments and then give a summary of the results .",
    "more technical details related to the results are provided in the appendices .",
    "to analyze the possible anisotropic spin singlet pairings for bi@xmath0x@xmath1 , we first identify all the possible anisotropic spin singlet pairing channels in a general manner from symmetry considerations and then analyze their properties . the actual relevance and the most probable channel of the anisotropic spin singlet pairings are to be presented in the next section .",
    "so , we consider in this section a realistic model for the band structure and a phenomenological correlation term that supports only spin singlet pairings .",
    "the model thus consists of two terms @xmath11 , in which @xmath12 is a tight binding term giving rise to the normal state band structure and @xmath13 is an exchange term that could give rise to the desired spin singlet pairings .",

    "the af exchange terms are known to be able to give rise to spin singlet pairings.@xcite since there are two orbitals , we have both intraorbital and interorbital terms , thus @xmath52 .",
    "they are written generally as @xmath53 and @xmath54 where @xmath55 runs over unit cells , @xmath56 runs over the six nn in plane bonds @xmath57 ( @xmath58=1 , 2 , 3 ) , and the @xmath59 summation in @xmath60 runs over the two orbitals .",
    "@xmath61 is the electron number operator for @xmath59 orbital .",
    "out of all the possible spin singlet pairing channels contained in @xmath13 , we focus on those pairings compatible with the crystal symmetry of the bi@xmath4x@xmath5 materials .",
    "taking advantage of the various irreducible representations identified earlier by liu _",
    "_ et al__@xcite , we find six tri @xmath62-dependent pairings which are compatible with the crystal symmetry and are spin singlets ( see appendix c ) .",
    "the six pairings identified include two intraorbital channels belonging to the @xmath63 representation , which are @xmath64 ( @xmath58=1 , 2 ) .",
    "@xmath65 are the magnitudes of the pairing terms .",
    "@xmath66 . @xmath67 and @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "there are also two interorbital pairings belonging to the @xmath63 representation , which could be obtained from the above two pairing terms by substituting @xmath69 by @xmath70 and identifying @xmath71 .",
    "the other two pairing channels belong to @xmath72 and are @xmath73 ( @xmath58=5 , 6 ) , in which @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 $ ] . in the following discussions , we use @xmath77 to refer to the @xmath58-th pairing defined above , in places where confusion is not incurred .",
    "the wave vector dependencies of the various pairing components determine their gap structures .",
    "for experimentally relevant chemical potentials , states on the fermi surface are all close to the @xmath78 point of the bz , it is thus enough to focus on small wave vectors . for the first and the third pairings",
    ", @xmath79 gives two line nodes of the gap along @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the other nodes determined by @xmath82 or @xmath83 are unlikely to occur since they lie on the bz boundary and are far away from the fermi surface . for the second and the fourth pairings ,",
    "the line nodes are determined by @xmath84 and satisfy @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "note that , for each @xmath87 , there are two solutions for @xmath88 for each @xmath59 .",
    "usually , only the two solutions related to @xmath89 lie on the fermi surface , so the second and fourth pairings in general also have two lines nodes .",
    "similarly , from @xmath90 we know that the fifth pairing usually has only one line node determined by states on the fermi surface with @xmath80 . and finally the sixth pairing also has only one set of line nodes determined by @xmath91 , consisting of states on the fermi surface with @xmath81 . among the six pairings identified ,",
    "the fifth ( @xmath92 ) and the sixth ( @xmath93 ) pairings are peculiar in that , though spin singlet , they have _ @xmath94-wave like odd @xmath62 dependencies _ for small wave vectors , which together with their odd orbital - parity is consistent with their spin singlet nature . here , we define spatial - parity and orbital - parity as the parities of the sc order parameter related with reversal of the wave vector and exchange of the two orbitals , respectively .    to check properties of the pairings identified above , we first calculate their surface local density of states ( sldos ) , which are directly observable via point contact spectra.@xcite the sldos are defined as the surface spectral function averaged over the surface wave vectors , that is @xmath95 , in which @xmath96 is the number of wave vectors @xmath97 in the surface bz.@xcite @xmath98 is the surface spectral function defined as imaginary part of the electronic surface green s functions ( gf ) obtained in terms of the iterative gf method ( or , transfer matrix method).@xcite see appendix d for a brief explanation of our usage of the iterative gf method . to distinguish possible surface - state contributions ,",
    "we calculate simultaneously the bulk local density of states ( bldos ) , which are obtained easily from the bulk gf . in these calculations , we first add directly a certain pairing term to @xmath12 without regarding its origin , to focus on a single pairing channel .",
    "se@xmath1 ( a , c , e ) and bi@xmath0te@xmath1 ( b , d , f ) .",

    "1(a ) to 1(f ) are the ldos for three typical pairings , for bi@xmath4se@xmath5 ( bi@xmath4te@xmath5 ) system at electron ( hole ) fillings specified by the chemical potentials as indicated .",
    "for the same pairing , qualitatively similar results are obtained for the two systems .",
    "bldos for the @xmath99 to @xmath100 pairings all show a v - shape demonstrating the linear density of states at the chemical potential .",
    "the sldos for these pairings are all similar to the bldos , indicating that there are no topological nontrivial surface abs . very interestingly , in figs .",
    "1(e ) and 1(f ) which are typical results for both @xmath92 and @xmath93 pairings , while the bldos still shows a linear density of states , a sharp zero energy peak appears in the sldos .",
    "this peak structure is reminiscent of the zbcp observed in some point contact spectra measurements in superconducting cu@xmath101bi@xmath4se@xmath5.@xcite while these zero energy peaks imply sharp zbcps in point contact spectra and stm experiments , they would broaden at finite temperature and thus within the experimental resolution.@xcite we also find that , a tri pairing consisting of a mixture of @xmath92 or @xmath93 and other pairings preserves the novel zero energy peak in the sldos , see figs .",
    "1(g ) and 1(h ) for typical examples .",
    "note that , because all the six pairings share the gap node at @xmath102 , the composite pairing consisting of several pairing components is still gapless in the bulk .",
    "this explains the v - shape bldos shown in figs.1(g ) and 1(h ) .",
    "the surface abs are more clearly seen from the surface spectral functions , as shown in fig . 2 for @xmath93 .",
    "along ( @xmath87 , 0 ) direction of the surface bz , the superconductor has a line node . along other directions such as ( 0 ,",
    "@xmath88 ) in fig .",
    "2 , a sc gap opens , the surface abs are clearly present and form a flat band .",
    "this is similar to the surface abs in some nodal spin triplet pairings.@xcite though the topological numbers for @xmath103 and @xmath104 with nodal lines are difficult to calculate directly @xcite , the number counting of zero energy surface abs are also indicative of important conclusions . by explicitly calculating the eigenstates for a thin film of the @xmath93 pairing",
    ", we confirmed that a _",
    "kramers pair of abs exists on both the top and the bottom surfaces . since an odd number of kramers pairs of surface states",
    "are generally protected from tri perturbations , the gapless surface abs for @xmath103 and @xmath104 should also be topologically stable . in this sense",
    ", we may say that @xmath92 and @xmath93 are topologically nontrivial spin singlet pairings . to our knowledge , they are the first reported spin singlet pairings in diii class that might be topologically nontrivial .",
    "se@xmath5 and ( b ) bi@xmath4te@xmath5 with fermi surface crossing the valence band",
    ". the darker the color , the larger the spectral weight.,width=321,height=472 ]",
    "before studying further properties of the novel spin singlet pairings identified above , it is important to ask if the spin singlet pairings are actually relevant to the superconducting state of bi@xmath0x@xmath1 ( x is se or te ) .",
    "that is , whether or not spin singlet pairing is the dominant pairing channel for realistic pairing mechanisms .",
    "since evidences have appeared that bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is a sizable correlated electron system @xcite , whereas the electron - phonon coupling ( epc ) in the present system is generally considered to be smaller than bcs superconductors@xcite , we would here take the _",
    "purely repulsive _ short range coulomb interaction as the pairing mechanism for bi@xmath0x@xmath1 .",
    "since epc usually favors spin singlet pairings , the following study stands as a more stringent test for the relevance of spin singlet pairings .",
    "compatible with our orbital convention , the coulomb repulsion terms are conveniently added to @xmath12 as @xmath105 in which @xmath59 runs over the two orbitals .",
    "since the two orbitals in the present model reside on different sites within a unit cell , we do not include the hund s coupling term between them.@xcite in addition , we expect the on - site intraorbital correlation stronger than the inter - site interorbital correlation , that is @xmath106 .",
    "starting from @xmath107 , the dominant superexchange couplings are derived using standard projection operator method ( schrieffer - wolf transformation).@xcite here , we retain the lowest order terms up to two site correlations .",
    "the superexchange terms are derived first at half filling . the relation @xmath108 imposes a local intraorbital no - double - occupancy condition . in principle , each hopping parameter and every pair of two different hopping parameters listed in table i could mediate a superexchange term .",
    "however , since the magnitudes of the various parameters differ greatly , we expect that the superexchange terms mediated by the largest several parameters in table i dominate the actual pairing instability .",
    "we thus select @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , which are apparently larger than the other parameters .",
    "we find that @xmath109 mediates the term @xmath60 , with @xmath112 independent of @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath110 , @xmath111 and their crossing mediate three interorbital superexchange terms , which combine to give @xmath113 , with @xmath114^{2}$ ] .",
    "@xmath115 arises from the crossing term between @xmath116 and @xmath117 and is defined as @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) for @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) , with @xmath58=1 , 2 , 3 .",
    "thus , the af exchange terms conceived in eqs .",
    "( 2)-(3 ) emerge naturally in bi@xmath0x@xmath1 if we consider short range repulsive coulomb interaction as the pairing mechanism .",
    "other parameters , such as @xmath122 in table i which could mediate superexchange correlations favoring triplet pairings , are too small to be competitive with the identified terms , for both bi@xmath4se@xmath5 and bi@xmath4te@xmath5 .",
    "more details about the derivation of the dominant superexchange terms can be found in appendix b. in conclusion , pairings mediated by purely repulsive short range coulomb interactions are dominantly spin singlet in bi@xmath0x@xmath1 .    besides confirming the hypothetical form of @xmath13 , an interesting new consequence of the above derivation is that @xmath113 only has @xmath123 symmetry with respect to @xmath35-axis , which is clear from the @xmath56-dependency of @xmath115 .",
    "this feature inherits directly from the @xmath117 term , because the crossing term between @xmath117 and @xmath116 is linear in @xmath117 .",
    "an immediate consequence of this real space anisotropic correlation is that it explicitly _ breaks the in plane inversion symmetry _ of @xmath13 , which implies that the _ in plane spatial - parity _ is not a good quantum number and the resulting pairing would be a mixture of even and odd spatial - parity states .",
    "the spatial - parity mixing effect is more clearly seen from the fourier transformation of the interorbital pairing potential in @xmath113 , which is @xmath124 \\cos(\\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{k'})\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{j }   \\notag \\\\ & & + i\\frac{m_{2}}{3r_{2 } } \\sin(\\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{k'})\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{j}\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath125 the number of unit cells in the whole lattice .",
    "this dynamical generation of an inversion symmetry breaking _ correlation _ term is an essential feature of the present model and is intrinsic to bi@xmath4x@xmath5 materials .",
    "we also mention that , though the @xmath111 term in @xmath12 already breaks the in - plane inversion , the present correlation term is different because firstly it depends also on @xmath110 and emerges as a crossing term between the @xmath110 and @xmath111 terms , secondly the mixing of pairings with even and odd spatial - parity is now explicit and their relative phase and weight are determined by the correlation term itself .    to see the relative importance of the six pairings identified formerly by symmetry , we have performed mean field calculations at zero temperature , in terms of a @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8@xmath7@xmath9@xmath7@xmath10 type full model @xmath126 ( see appendix c for details ) .",
    "first , we decouple @xmath13 by introducing nonequivalent bond pairing terms.@xcite six intraorbital pairings for the @xmath18 orbital are introduced as @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "another six intraorbital pairings @xmath129 are similarly defined for the @xmath19 orbital .",
    "six interorbital pairings are introduced as @xmath130 ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "a translational invariant pairing phase is assumed , so that the @xmath131 pairing terms are independent of @xmath55 .",
    "since we focus on the sc phase , the decoupling of @xmath13 to the normal phase is disregarded .",
    "terms in @xmath132 are decoupled in the simplest manner as @xmath133 .",
    "for each set of parameters ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 and doping or chemical potential ) , we then get the @xmath131 mean field pairing order parameters self - consistently from many different initial values . finally , the amplitudes of the six pairing terms are projected out of the solution.@xcite we find that , for parameters typical for bi@xmath4se@xmath5 and bi@xmath4te@xmath5 , the dominant pairing channel is a mixture of @xmath100 and @xmath93 pairings with a tiny admixture of the @xmath134 pairing .",
    "all other pairing components are identically zero .",
    "in addition , though there are usually several coexisting pairing components , the pairing is _ time reversal invariant _ up to a global @xmath135 phase , same as the conclusion of a similar calculation for iron pnictides.@xcite we emphasize that the two main features of the results , coexistence of several pairing components and the time reversal invariance of the full pairing , are true for all model parameters that we have tried , which are spanned by @xmath136 ev , 20 ev ] , @xmath137 ev , 8 ev ] and @xmath138 $ ] ( @xmath139 is the number of excess electrons in each unit cell ) .",
    "the robustness of the two features are consequences of the interorbital superexchange correlation term , as shown in eq.(5 ) , from which the pairings of even spatial - parity and of odd spatial - parity always appear together in a time reversal invariant combination .",
    "we should confess that the present mean field studies underestimate the fluctuation effect and the competition from possible magnetic normal states , so that the pairing instability is overestimated .",
    "however , the dominant pairing channel should still be spin singlet even if these corrections are taken into account , which are left to future works .",
    "the novel spin singlet pairings , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , could be distinguished experimentally from other candidate pairings .",
    "firstly , since they give quite different surface spectral functions@xcite , the correct pairing symmetry could be read from arpes if the precision of measurement can reach the order of @xmath140 mev.@xcite secondly , the sldos which could be probed by point contact spectroscopy or stm can also be used to discriminate among the candidate pairings .",
    "for example , the fully gapped interorbital triplet pairing gives an in - gap nonzero energy double - peak structure in sldos at low temperature and for good contact.@xcite however , the @xmath92 or @xmath93 pairing always gives a single zbcp .",
    "while our proposal is in better agreement with existing experiments@xcite , more measurements are desired to get a definite conclusion .",
    "thirdly , the static spin susceptibilities show clear differences for different candidate pairings and thus could be used to discriminate some of them .",
    "fourthly , the thermal conductivity which depends sensitively on the anisotropy of the pairings was proposed to discriminate two triplet pairings.@xcite it should also be able to tell @xmath103 or @xmath104 pairing from the other candidate ( triplet ) pairings .",
    "details that lead to the above conclusions are to be published elsewhere . besides the above proposals , our spin singlet pairing state is not in direct contradiction with existing experiments . not only for experiments pointing to polar or anisotropic pairings , it could also be in agreement with a specific heat experiment which shows that the pairing has a fully gapped component.@xcite though the novel singlet pairings @xmath103 or @xmath104 are both gapless , a fully gapped @xmath62-independent interorbital spin singlet component could be readily added into our mixed pairing state to give the experimental feature ( see appendix b ) .    to summarize ,",
    "we have studied the possible anisotropic spin singlet pairings in bi@xmath0x@xmath1 ( x is se or te ) .",
    "two novel interorbital spin singlet pairings with odd spatial - parity and odd orbital - parity support surface abs , which form zero energy flat bands .",
    "the presence of only one kramers pair of abs on each surface implies that they should be topologically stable against tri perturbations .",
    "considering purely repulsive short range coulomb interaction as the pairing mechanism , the low energy effective model turns out indeed to be dominated by spin - singlet - favoring af correlations .",
    "besides , the interorbital af correlation favors a pairing state with mixed spatial - parity . it would be interesting to see if this prediction can be verified by future experiments .",
