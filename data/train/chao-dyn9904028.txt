    "we will be interested in the statistical behavior of the stationary states ( invariant measures ) of ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) if they exist , or the transient states with possibly random initial data .",
    "there are two main reasons for considering this problem .",
    "the first is that ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) and its multi - dimensional version are among the simplest nonlinear models in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics . as such they serve as qualitative models for a wide variety of problems including charge density waves @xcite , vortex lines in high temperature super - conductors @xcite , dislocations in disordered solids and kinetic roughening of interfaces in epitaxial growth @xcite , formation of large - scale structures in the universe @xcite , etc .",
    "the connection between these problems and ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) can be understood as follows .",
    "consider an elastic string in a random potential @xmath6 .",
    "the string is assumed to be _ directed _ in the sense that there is a time - like direction , assumed to be  @xmath7 , such that the configuration of the string is a graph over the @xmath7-axis .",
    "let @xmath8 be the partition function for the configurations of the string in the interval @xmath9 , pinned at position  @xmath10 at time  @xmath11 :    z(x , t ) = .^-_0^t ds   v(w(s),s ) |w(t)=x ,    where @xmath12 denotes the expectation over all brownian paths @xmath13 such that @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath17 is the temperature . the free energy , @xmath18 then satisfies    _ t + ||^2 = + v ,    where @xmath19 .",
    "this is the well - known kardar - parisi - zhang equation @xcite . in one dimension",
    "if we let @xmath20 , @xmath21 , we obtain ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) .",
    "the second reason for studying ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) is in some sense a technical one . for a long time , ( [ eq:1.1 ] )",
    "has served as the benchmark for field - theoretic techniques such as the direct interaction approximation or the renormalization group methods , developed for solving the problem of hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "this role of ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) is made more evident by the recent flourish of activities introducing fairly sophisticated techniques in field theory to hydrodynamics @xcite . in this context ( [ eq:1.1 ] )",
    "is often referred to as burgers turbulence .",
    "since the phenomenology of the so - called burgers turbulence is far simpler than that of real turbulence , one hopes that exact results can be obtained which can then be used to benchmark the methods .",
    "however so far our experience has proved otherwise : the problem of burgers turbulence is complicated enough that a wide variety of predictions have been made as a consequence of the wide variety of techniques used @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to clarify this situation and to obtain exact results that are expected for burgers turbulence . along the way we will also develop some technical aspects that we believe will be useful for other problems .",
    "the main issues that interest us are the scaling of the structure functions and the asymptotic behavior of the probability density functions ( pdf ) in the inviscid limit .",
    "the former is well - understood heuristically but we will derive the results from self - consistent asymptotics on the master equation .",
    "the latter is at the moment very controversial , and we hope to settle the controversy by deriving exact results on the asymptotic behavior for the pdfs .    from a technical point of view",
    "we insist on working with the master equation and making no closure assumptions .",
    "the unclosed term is expressed in terms of the statistics of singular dissipative structures of the field , here the shocks .",
    "we then derive a master equation for the statistics of the environment of the shocks by relating them to the singular structures on the shocks , namely the points of shock creation and collisions .",
    "these are then amenable to local analysis . in this way",
    "we achieve closure through dimension reduction .",
    "we then extract information on the asymptotic behavior of pdfs using realizability constraints and self - consistent asymptotics .",
    "we certainly hope that this philosophy will be useful for other problems .",
    "one main issue that will be addressed in this paper is the behavior of the pdf of the velocity gradient . assuming statistical homogeneity ,",

    "this amounts to requiring    [ eq:1.4 ] u(x+,t)u(x-,t ) ,    for all @xmath35 .",
    "the entropy condition ( [ eq:1.4 ] ) is the effect of the viscous term in the inviscid limit .",

    "we are interested in    q(,t)=_x0q^(,x , t ) .",
    "one natural question is whether    [ eq:1.4.1 ] q = q .",
    "we will present very strong argument that ( [ eq:1.4.1 ] ) holds for generic initial data and for the type of forces described after ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) .",
    "some of our results also apply to @xmath38 for the more general case when it is possibly different from @xmath39 .",
    "the issue now reduces to the evaluation or approximation of @xmath40 .",
    "several different proposals have been made , each leads at statistical steady state ( @xmath41 ) to an asymptotic expression of the form    q ( ) ~\\ {    ll c_-||^- & as   - , + c_+^^-^3/(3b_1 ) & as   + ,    .",

    "based on heuristic arguments , bouchaud and mzard @xcite introduced a langevin equation for the local slope of the velocity , which gives @xmath53 , @xmath54 . the instanton analysis @xcite predicts the right tail of @xmath38 without giving a precise value for @xmath43 , and it does not give any specific prediction for the left tail .",
    "e  _ et  al .",
    "_ @xcite made a geometrical evaluation of the effect of @xmath55 , based on the observation that large negative gradients are generated near shock creation .",

    ", it was claimed that this bound is actually reached , i.e. , @xmath57 .",
    "finally gotoh and kraichnan @xcite argued that the viscous term is negligible to leading order for large @xmath58 , i.e. @xmath59 for @xmath60 , giving rise to @xmath61 and @xmath62 .    in this paper",
    ", we will first give a more detailed proof of the bound    > 3 ,    announced in @xcite .",
    "we will then show that    = 7/2 ,    by studying the master equation for the environment of the shocks .",
    "an important reason behind the success of this program is that local behavior near the most singular structures ( here the points of shock creation ) is understood .",

    "in particular , shocks are created at zero amplitude and the shock strength adds up at collision . for transient states",
    "these statements follow from standard results for the deterministic case under appropriate conditions for the initial data @xcite . for stationary states , these results are of the type established in @xcite under a non - degeneracy condition for the forcing .    before ending this introduction , we make some remarks about notations and nomenclature . in analogy with fluid mechanics @xmath34 will be referred to as the velocity field .",

( [ eq:1.5 ] ) holds if for all measurable , real - valued functional @xmath78 we have    ( u(,t ) ) = ( u(+y , t ) ) y.    note that from ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) and the assumptions on  @xmath79 , it follows that ( [ eq:1.5 ] ) holds for all times if @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the initial velocity field . also ,",
    "if a statistical steady state exists and is unique , then it satisfies ( [ eq:1.5 ] ) . the second symmetry will be referred to as statistical parity invariance , and is related to the invariance of ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) under the transformation @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",

    "it seems likely that other statistical quantities , such as the tails of the velocity pdf and the pdf for velocity difference , can also be analyzed in the present framework by exploiting further the source terms in ( [ eq:3.6 ] ) , ( [ eq:3.20 ] ) .",
    "( [ eq : a.1 ] ) is unclosed since the form of @xmath462 and @xmath463 entering the viscous terms is unknown .",
    "most work has resorted to various closure assumptions .",
    "our main goal has been to find ways to extract information from the master equations such as ( [ eq : a.1 ] ) , without making any closure assumption .",
    "note that from the identity                    lemma  [ th : a.2 ] can be proven upon noting that @xmath470 satisfies @xmath471 , an equation that can obtained by integration of ( [ eq : a.1 ] ) . since @xmath472 initially , it is zero for all time . in the statistically homogeneous case , ( [ eq : a.3 ] )",

    "( [ eq : a.3 ] ) also ensures that this equation preserves the normalization of @xmath460 .",
