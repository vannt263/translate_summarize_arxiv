    "many massive clusters of galaxies host mpc - scale diffuse radio emission that is not associated with active galactic nuclei ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this synchrotron emission implies the presence of @xmath13 g magnetic fields , a population of cosmic - ray electrons / positrons ( cre@xmath14 ) , and a spatially distributed mechanism to ( re)accelerate the cre@xmath14 .",
    "the two most likely mechanisms for the maintenance of the cre@xmath14 distribution are turbulent re - acceleration after a major merger @xcite and secondary production through collisions of long - lived cosmic ray protons ( crp ) with thermal protons @xcite .",
    "the crp can be accelerated at strong shocks during cluster formation , and reside in the deep potential wells for a hubble time ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the gmrt radio halo survey @xcite , which surveyed a complete sample of high x - ray luminosity clusters , showed a bi - modality in the grh population which is consistent with expectations from models based on merger - driven re - acceleration @xcite .",
    "those clusters that host a grh follow a correlation between the radio and x - ray luminosities , which we designate here as the  on - state \" .",
    "the remaining  off - state \" clusters show no signs of diffuse emission even in deep gmrt images .",
    "the distinguishing characteristic between on and off - state appears to be the presence or absence of major merger activity , respectively , although outliers do exist @xcite .    despite the difficulties that pure secondary models have in explaining recent observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there are reasons to expect mpc - scale diffuse emission even in the off - state clusters .",
    "though _ fermi _ observations have placed upper limits on the ratio of non - thermal crp to thermal energy densities at the level of @xmath155%-10% in several clusters @xcite , secondary cre@xmath14 from these allowed levels would still produce faint diffuse emission in the presence of @xmath13 g magnetic fields . additionally , even off - state clusters in the turbulent re - acceleration model should host steep spectrum grhs that should be detectable with upcoming low frequency radio arrays ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", we provide the most stringent constraints on the off - state synchrotron emission and grh bi - modality by stacking images of massive , radio - quiet , clusters from the sydney university molonglo sky survey ( sumss , * ? ? ?",

    "we assume @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and define the synchrotron spectral index @xmath20 by @xmath21 .",
    "we started with a sample of luminous x - ray clusters , l@xmath0 @xmath1 10@xmath2  erg  s@xmath3 , so that the clusters would be sufficiently massive to have deep potential wells , reservoirs of thermal plasma , and have had time to accumulate crp .",
    "we further restricted the clusters to @xmath22 ; at that redshift , the declination - dependent sumss resolution , with a maximum of 90@xmath23 , corresponded to @xmath15295  kpc , allowing at least 3 independent beams across a 1  mpc grh . from the x - ray galaxy clusters database ( bax , *",

    ", we first convolved each image as a function of redshift such that each beam is @xmath15300  kpc in diameter .",
    "we then filtered out smaller - scale emission due to compact and slightly extended radio galaxies , using the multi - scale spatial filter of @xcite and a box size of 600  kpc .",
    "all images were re - scaled and resampled so that each pixel is the same physical size .",
    "after this processing , a 1  mpc grh of a given surface - brightness would appear the same at any redshift , and would add coherently if present in more than one ( or all ) of the clusters .",
    "statistics for each image were calculated ( mean , rms , and peak fluxes ) within a 1 mpc box around the center , as well as a 1 - 3 mpc annular box for background subtraction and noise estimation .      from these 149 processed images , we needed to eliminate those that could have significant contamination from residual emission from bright point sources . to quantify the possible point source contamination , we injected synthetic 10  jy sources into each of the images prior to the processing .",
    "the resulting stack showed @xmath25  jy  beam@xmath3 peak emission , or 0.33% leakage .",
    "point source contamination in our stack is therefore negligible compared to other noise contributions .",
    "marginally extended sources could contaminate the filtered images at a higher level , so we eliminated their possible influence empirically .",
    "after background removal , we plotted the diffuse , filtered flux within the 1  mpc box against the peak unfiltered flux within 1  mpc ( not shown ) .",
    "clusters with peak fluxes below 0.25  jy  beam@xmath3 did not show any correlation between compact and filtered diffuse emission , and were kept for further analysis ; 105 clusters met this criterion .",
    "our filtering procedure can , unfortunately , also reduce the observed flux from our target diffuse emission . to assess the amount of missing flux",
    ", we therefore injected 1  mpc , 0.5  mpc , 0.25  mpc , and 0.125  mpc gaussians into each stacked image.we recover 91% , 60% , 18% , and 4% of the total injected flux , respectively . for the luminosities listed in table 1 , we assumed 1  mpc gaussian halos , and thus scaled all the calculated luminosities up by 1/0.91=1.1 .",
    "we also created a control sample of 105 randomly selected fields assigned to the same redshifts as the cluster sample , and processed those in an identical manner .",
    "visual inspection of the cluster images did not reveal hints of large - scale diffuse emission .",
    "we compared integrated flux measurements from sumss and from the parkes telescope for several large sources , and found that sumss is sensitive out to at least 20@xmath26 scales ( the closest cluster in our high-@xmath27 sample is z=0.048 , where 1  mpc is 17.9@xmath26 ) .",
    "we further injected low signal - to - noise gaussian halos of various sizes directly into the images , and conclude that individual 1  mpc halos with luminosities of @xmath28  w / hz would be visible in sumss over the range of redshifts in our sample ( assuming @xmath20=1.2 ) .",

    "we therefore stacked using a weighted mean , where the weight was the inverse variance ( 1/@xmath31 ) of each image in the background region between 1 and 3  mpc .",
    "the results of stacking the 105 cluster and control fields are shown in figure [ stacks2 ] and table 1 .",

    "higher values of @xmath30 indicate more centrally dominated , and thus relaxed , clusters , while lower values of @xmath30 tend to indicate the presence of sub - structure induced by cluster mergers .",
    "we calculated @xmath30 from the rosat all sky survey @xcite images of the clusters .",
    "we ordered the individual radio luminosity values of the 104 . ] clusters by their @xmath30 parameter value and performed a bayesian change - point analysis to determine the value of @xmath30 at which the distribution of luminosities changed in mean and standard deviation .",
    "the analysis found @xmath35 as the most likely transition value , where the ( @xmath36 ) for clusters with @xmath37 was ( 5.6 , 2.4 , 8.2)@xmath38  w  hz@xmath3 , and ( 2.1 , 1.2 , 26.0)@xmath38  w  hz@xmath3 for clusters with @xmath39 .",

    "we find that 10 of the 52 high-@xmath27 clusters have radio errors considerably larger than the rest of the sample ( see fig . [ lrclusters ] ) , so we selected the 42 lowest noise clusters and their corresponding controls and compared their luminosity distributions .",
    "application of the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test gives a 5% probability that the clusters are drawn from the same population as the control sample ( which by definition has zero contribution of real diffuse luminosity ) , thus confirming the detection found in fig .",
    "[ stacks2 ] .",
    "the next question is whether the difference is due to a handful of luminous on - correlation clusters , or whether most / all clusters having a small positive signal far below the on - correlation .    to address this , we first added a fixed luminosity to each control field and recalculated the probability that the cluster and control samples are drawn from the same population .",
    "the probability reaches a maximum of 91% when we add a luminosity of 5@xmath38  w / hz to each control field , consistent with our measured stacked luminosity and the gmrt upper limits ( fig .",
    "[ gmrtplot ] ) .",
    "we next performed a monte carlo analysis injecting an on - correlation luminosity into a small number of the control fields , using the radio halo fractions of @xcite , and leaving the rest unchanged .",
    "after 10@xmath45 random realisations , the mean likelihood that the observed and modified control distributions were the same was 13@xmath85% , with no cases @xmath4639% .",
    "while not statistically incontestable , we do find it most likely that a large number of clusters have an approximate luminosity of 3 - 5@xmath38  w / hz , representing their luminosity when they are in the  off - state \" .",
    "the fact that the average luminosity of an off - state cluster is an order of magnitude less than on - correlation grhs implies a bi - modal distribution , consistent with results from the gmrt grh survey ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we can further investigate how the stacked flux is distributed among the clusters by plotting the cumulative luminosity .",
    "figure [ cumdis ] shows the cumulative luminosity of the entire cluster sample ( black squares ) , the high-@xmath27 sample ( red circles ) , and the low-@xmath30 sample ( blue crosses ) , all of which produced positive detections ( fig .",
    "[ stacks2 ] ) .",
    "the cumulative luminosity was calculated in ascending @xmath27 order , and we have applied the same weighting as in our stacking .",
    "there are several important features of the distribution : 1 ) there are several locations where the distribution jumps , indicating strong contributions from a few clusters ; 2 ) in addition to these jumps , the overall positive trend above @xmath47  erg / s indicates a significant distribution of the flux among most of the clusters ( as demonstrated statistically above ) ; 3 ) the off - state emission is a function of @xmath27 , even within the crude sub - sampling performed in the stacks .",
    "the @xmath27 dependence can be investigated by further splitting the high-@xmath27 sample into two .",
    "the top 13 clusters show a strong linear rise in cumulative luminosity , so we stacked the top 13 and the remaining 39 separately , and show the images in fig .",
    "[ cumdis ] and values in fig .",
    "[ gmrtplot ] .",
    "we see significant emission from both subsamples , again confirming that the off - state emission comes from many clusters .",
    "we note that the value obtained in the 39 cluster stack suggests that bi - modality extends down to lower @xmath43 clusters than has been probed by previous studies ( see fig .",
    "[ gmrtplot ] ) .",
    "the statistics of grhs observed with the gmrt suggest that , if our sample where complete , we would expect roughly 2 - 4 sources in the high-@xmath27 sample @xcite .",
    "we therefore took a more conservative approach for calculating the off - state and assumed that there could be as many as 3 grhs in our sample .",
    "we removed the top three contributors to the cumulative distribution and recalculated the stack , obtaining @xmath48  w / hz .",
    "we believe this value is a better estimate of the true off - state luminosity for high-@xmath43 clusters .",
    "the presence of low - level mpc - scale emission in off - state clusters requires a cluster - wide cre@xmath14 acceleration mechanism and minimum energy icm magnetic fields of @xmath49 g ( assuming @xmath29 ; @xcite ) .",

    "our results ( fig [ stacks2 ] ) show that disturbed clusters have stronger off - state mpc - scale emission . however , fig .",
    "[ lrclusters ] indicates that this is partially degenerate with high-@xmath27 for our sample .",
    "@xcite found that on - state radio halos were not found in clusters with @xmath50 , the radio luminosity of these systems being constrained by upper limits from gmrt radio observations at 610 mhz .. _ prima facie _ , our results show that high @xmath27 and disturbed clusters preferentially show mpc - scale diffuse emission in off - state clusters as well .",
    "it has been suggested that radio halos with very steep spectrum are generated in connection with less energetic merger events ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these sources should appear preferentially at lower radio frequencies and would be sub - luminous halos at @xmath15ghz frequencies .",
    "thus one possibility is that our stacked radio signal from off - state clusters is from these faint systems .",
    "lofar is expected to detect most of these systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and will allow for testing of this possibility .",
    "+ cr - protons : an exciting possibility is that we are detecting diffuse emission from secondary cre@xmath14 resulting from crp collisions with thermal protons .",
    "_ fermi _ limits @xcite allow the crp energy density to be at most 5 - 10% of the thermal energy density in clusters , while gmrt upper limits from the - non detection of diffuse mpc - scale emission in off - state clusters constrain the ratio of crp and thermal energy density to less than several percent , provided these systems are magnetized at the few @xmath13 g level @xcite .",
    "the level of emission detected in these systems is close to these gmrt limits , implying a ratio of crp to thermal energy density @xmath153% ( in 1 mpc@xmath51 volume ) , assuming @xmath52 g . in a recent paper @xcite calculated models where primary crp and their secondary products are reaccelerated by merger - driven mhd turbulence generating giant radio halos .",
    "according to these calculations the synchrotron emission from secondary particles in off - state non - turbulent systems is a factor @xmath1510 fainter than that in grh , in rough agreement with our observations . in this scenario",
    "it is also expected that the synchrotron emission scales with the amount of turbulence in the hosting clusters , with grh becoming gradually more powerful ( and with harder spectra ) in more turbulent ( disturbed ) systems .",
    "this may explain why we detect mpc - scale emission preferentially in low - c clusters .",
    "additional possibilities for understanding the correlation with cluster dynamics might stem from differences in magnetic properties and crp dynamics in relaxed and disturbed clusters @xcite .",
    "+ diffuse radio galaxies : it is possible that these massive clusters host faint synchrotron emission from past / current agn activity , though we do nt see any actively driven jets on these scales in the individual images . absent the jet driven power , the cre@xmath14 would still require some in situ re - acceleration in order to be present on these large scales .",
    "additionally , the emission is correlated with disturbed x - ray morphology ( low-@xmath30 ) , while it is typically cooiing - core clusters ( high-@xmath30 ) that host powerful extended radio galaxies in their core .",
    "these sources are also heavily suppressed by our filtering .",
    "we performed a statistical analysis of the diffuse , mpc - scale , radio emission in 105 massive clusters from the sumss survey .",
    "our major findings are 1 ) mpc - scale diffuse radio emission is detected in formerly radio quiescent clusters , at a level slightly below current upper limits .",
    "this emission is likely originating from clusters in the off - state ; 2 ) there is a substantial population of clusters with @xmath53 much less than the observed @xmath42 luminosity correlation for grhs , confirming grh bi - modality .",
    "we further confirm bi - modality in lower @xmath43 clusters than has previously been known ; 3 ) off - state emission is correlated with high-@xmath27 and disturbed cluster morphology , analogous to on - state grhs @xcite ; 4 ) magnetic fields at the @xmath151  @xmath13 g level are present on mpc - scales even in formerly radio - quiescent massive clusters .",
