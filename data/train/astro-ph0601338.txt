    "@xcite , and soon after @xcite , produced the first estimates of the cosmic star formation history .",
    "since then , the growing number of deep extragalactic surveys has allowed galaxy evolution to be tackled in more and more detail , to higher and higher redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all these studies point towards a substantial amount of star formation at early cosmic epochs .",
    "more recently , a number of studies , mainly based on nir selected surveys like 2mass @xcite , munics @xcite , k20 @xcite , fires @xcite , hdf @xcite and goods+fdf @xcite , have been able to measure directly the stellar mass density up to high redshifts .",
    "the two independent approaches are in a remarkably good agreement , and suggest that about half of the present  day stars was already in place at z @xmath4 1 , when the universe was half of its present age .",
    "the assembly of the stellar mass through cosmic time is a crucial test for models of galaxy formation and evolution @xcite .",
    "such models aim at linking the hierarchical growth of dark matter structures to the observed galaxy properties , by means of simplified prescriptions for the formation of baryonic systems in dark matter haloes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an effective way to put sensitive constraints on the models is to understand where the stars were located , specifically what was the morphology of their host galaxies , at different look - back times .",
    "in fact , this permits to directly probe how galaxies assembled their stars , and how their morphology ( i.e. , at least with some approximation , their dynamical status ) evolves .",
    "since merging is driving both mass assembly and dynamical evolution in a hierarchical scenario , these studies offer a direct probe of the role of this process in galaxy evolution .    because of the lack of sufficient angular resolution , galaxies have been often classified , both at low and high redshift , as early or late types based on their broad band colors @xcite . however",
    "this kind of approach suffers , especially at high redshift , from the obvious drawback that a disk galaxy populated by an old stellar population would be classified as an early  type object ( and vice versa ) .",
    "@xcite used the concentration parameter to discriminate between early and late type objects in a complete sample extracted from local surveys .",
    "they found that in the local universe the _ transition mass _ , i.e. the mass at which disks become dominant in the relative contribution to the total stellar mass function , is @xmath5m@xmath3 . in this work",
    "we rely on a deep , complete and automatically morphologically classified sample to study the contribution of galaxies of different morphologies to the redshift evolution of the stellar mass density .",
    "@xcite , and also @xcite , have carried out a work qualitatively similar to the one we present here , but based on shallower samples and visual morphological classification .",
    "this letter is organized as follows : in  [ sec_data ] we discuss the dataset on which this work is based , in  [ sec_sersic ] we present the surface brightness profiles modeling , and in  [ sec_mass ] our results on the evolution of mass functions , mass densities and specific star formation rates ( ssfr , i.e. star formation rate per unit stellar mass ) split by morphological type .",
    "finally , in  [ sec_conclusions ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "we use ab magnitudes and adopt a cosmology with @xmath6=0.3 , @xmath7=0.7 , and h@xmath8=70 kms@xmath9mpc@xmath9 .",
    "this study is based on photometric catalogs derived for the fors deep field ( fdf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and part of the goods  south field ( salvato et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the two fields cover approximately the same area ( 39.8 arcmin@xmath11 for fdf and 50.6 arcmin@xmath11 for goods  s ) .",
    "the fdf photometric catalog covers the ubgrizjks broad bands , plus an intermediate band centered at 834 nm .",
    "the i - selected catalog used here lists 5557 galaxies down to @xmath12 . for the goods  s field , our k - band selected catalog contains 3240 galaxies , and it consists of ubvrijhk broad - band photometry ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* vandame et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "number counts match the literature values down to @xmath13 .",
    "photometric redshifts are derived using the method described in @xcite .",
    "their accuracy is 3% and 5% for fdf and goods  s respectively , with @xmath14 outliers for both fields ( for more details see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for all galaxies in both catalogs ,",
    "the m / l ratios were estimated with a log  likelihood based sed fitting technique , using a library of seds built with the @xcite code , assuming a @xcite imf .",
    "the procedure used is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "we use here the same mass catalog as in @xcite , so we refer the reader to this paper for more details .",
    "both the fdf and goods  s fields were imaged with the acs camera on board the hst .",
    "the fdf was imaged in the broad ",
    "band f814w filter , with 4 wfc pointings of 40 minutes exposure each , reaching a 10@xmath15 limit of 26 mag .",
    "the data reduction was performed with the standard _",
    "calacs _ pipeline , and the combined final mosaic was produced with the multidrizzle package @xcite .",
    "the goods ",
    "s field was imaged in four different filters ( bviz ) as part of the acs goods legacy @xcite ; the 10@xmath15 limit in the f775w band is 26.5 mag .",
    "we make use of the publicly available packages gim2d @xcite and galfit @xcite to fit psf convolved @xcite profiles to the two - dimensional surface brightness of each object , down to a limit of f814w=24 ( fdf ) and f775w=24.5 ( goods  s ) .",
    "the psfs used to convolve the profiles were obtained for each individual tile by stacking about 10 high s / n isolated stars .",
    "the results from the two different codes are in excellent agreement , thus confirming the robustness both of our modeling and of the choice of flux limits .",
    "more details on the reduction and the data quality assessment , as well as on the whole fitting procedure and relative validation , will be described in pannella et al .",
    "( in preparation ) . in order to further check our morphological classification ,",
    "visual morphology was performed by uh according to the @xcite classification scheme .",
    "a tight correlation is obtained between the average visual and automated classifications , parameterized by the morphological type @xmath16 and the sersic index @xmath17 , respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : morph_nt ] ) . using the visual or automated classification",
    "does not significantly affect the results presented in this study .",
    "we split our sample , according to the sersic index , in early  type ( n @xmath18 3.5 , @xmath4 t @xmath19 -3 ) , intermediate ( 2 @xmath19 n @xmath20 3.5 , @xmath4 -3 @xmath20 t @xmath19 2 ) and late  type ( n @xmath20 2 , @xmath4 t @xmath21 2 ) .",
    "we evaluated the effect of morphological k - correction on this coarse classification scheme by also performing the surface brightness modeling on b and @xmath22band images for a subsample of the goods - s galaxies .",
    "we found that our broad classification is robust for objects at @xmath23 .",
    "thus we restrict our analysis to @xmath23 .",
    "finally , we estimate the mass completeness of the two ( fdf and goods - s ) catalogs as the mass of a maximally old stellar population having , at every redshift , an observed magnitude equal to the catalog completeness magnitude ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the final catalog contains 1645 galaxies .",
    "we performed extensive monte - carlo simulations to take into account the effect of mass uncertainties ( @xmath24dex ) on our results .",
    "ten thousand simulations of the mass catalog were generated , perturbing each mass within a gaussian of sigma equal to its error . unless stated differently in the relevant figure captions , we use the median values of the monte - carlo simulations in all figures .",
    "error bars take into account both poissonian errors on the median counts @xcite , and 16 - 84@xmath25 percentile values of each distribution .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : morph_mf ] we show the v / v@xmath26 corrected stellar mass functions , split by morphological type , in three redshift bins .",
    "the redshift intervals were chosen to have comparable numbers of objects in each bin .",
    "a dotted vertical line shows the mass completeness for each redshift bin .",
    "we find that , at all redshifts , the late  type objects dominate the low  mass end of the mass function , while the early and intermediate  type objects dominate the high  mass end .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "[ fig : morph_mf ] shows that the relative contribution of disks to the high  mass end of the mass function increases with redshift .",
    "this suggests that : _",
    "i ) _ the morphological mix at the high  mass end evolves with redshift ; _ ii ) _ the transition mass increases with redshift .",
    "the latter finding was already suggested in @xcite , but its significance was hampered by their mass completeness limit . in our case , the transition seems to happen well above the estimated mass completeness . as fig .",
    "[ fig : morph_mf ] shows , at @xmath1 the disks and bulges contributions become comparable at @xmath27m@xmath3 .    in order to better explore the evolution of the morphological mix at the high  mass end , we cut the three subsamples at the same common mass completeness ( m@xmath2m@xmath3 ) hereafter .",
    "this guarantees a fair comparison between the three redshift bins .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ morph_mix_evol ] shows the behavior of the ratio of the number densities of bulges and disks . at increasing redshift",
    ", this ratio is found to systematically decrease with respect to the no  evolution hypothesis at more than 3@xmath15 significance . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ morph_mix_evol ] , we show the stellar mass density split by morphological type at different redshifts .",
    "the error estimates of the total values include the cosmic variance contribution , estimated as in @xcite .    in agreement with previous studies ( see  1 ) , we find that at @xmath1 massive objects host almost half of the stellar mass contained in similarly massive objects at @xmath28 .",
    "in addition , we find that the contribution to the total mass budget from early and late type galaxies is almost equal at @xmath1 , but strongly evolves with redshift : there is a _ mass pouring _ from disk systems to bulge  dominated objects .",
    "our findings require a scenario in which massive objects almost double their mass from redshift 1 to 0 , and become more and more bulge  dominated systems as time goes by .",
    "a possibility is that _ in situ _ star formation increases the mass and secular evolution modifies the morphology @xcite . under simplified assumptions",
    ", we can estimate whether the star formation rates ( sfr ) of the galaxies in our three redshift subsamples can account for a doubling of the stellar mass by z = 0 .",
    "following @xcite , the sfr of individual objects can be estimated from the restframe uv luminosity as @xmath29 in units of m@xmath3yr@xmath9 , where the constant factor is computed for a salpeter imf .",
    "we apply a dust attenuation correction of a@xmath30mag to the whole sample .",
    "this median value , assumed not to depend on redshift , is derived as in @xcite by comparing the total stellar mass density and the integral of the sfr density at different look ",
    "back times . fig .",
    "[ ssfr ] shows the median ssfr values for the three redshift bins and for the different morphological types , cut at the same mass completeness as described above .",
    "since it is not possible to know the individual star formation histories , we derive the median sfr decline with cosmic time from the massive galaxies subsample , and we assume that all the objects in our sample follow this median star formation history . in this way we can estimate , at every redshift , the minimum ssfr that enables an object to double its mass by z = 0 .",
    "these minimum ssfrs are shown in the plot as horizontal lines at the last two redshift bins considered .",
    "it appears that only a small fraction of the @xmath1 sample would be able to double its mass .",
    "an alternative and more likely solution ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is a continuous accretion of smaller mass galaxies , and possibly the merging of massive disks , which can account for both the changing total mass budget and the morphological mix evolution .    in the past",
    "a number of works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have focused on the ssfr redshift evolution and consistently found an increase of the ssfrs with redshift .",
    "hence the bulk of star formation in massive galaxies was pushed to @xmath31 , in agreement with the downsizing scenario @xcite .    here for the first time we explore the ssfr evolution split by different morphological types .",
    "we find , for objects with m@xmath2m@xmath3 , a different behavior in the ssfr redshift evolution for the different morphological types .",
    "the median ssfr of late - type objects shows only a mild , if any , evolution up to redshift 1 , while the median values of early and intermediate types are clearly increasing with redshift .",
    "since these latter populations are dominanting in numbers , they drive the redshift evolution of the whole massive galaxies distribution .",
    "this finding , together with the previous arguments , suggests that the morphological evolution of massive disk galaxies toward more and more bulge dominated systems is accompanied by a decrease in the specific star formation rate of their end products .",
    "@xcite show that a large part of the star formation in massive galaxies at @xmath32 is due to normal spiral galaxies .",
    "moreover , they conclude that turning off star formation in these objects is responsible for the observed decline of cosmic star formation therafter . we find a good agreement at @xmath32 with their result but also a hint that the decline of star formation in massive galaxies is linked more to the evolution of bulge  dominated galaxies .",
    "in this letter we have studied the contribution of disks and bulges to the evolution of the stellar mass function up to @xmath1 .",
    "we agree with @xcite that the transition mass , i.e. the mass at which disks become dominant in the relative contribution to the total mass function , increases with redshift .",
    "we estimate that at @xmath1 the transition mass is up to a factor 2 larger than its measured local value .",
    "we show that the morphological mix evolves with redshift . at @xmath1",
    "early and late type galaxies contribute nearly equally to the total mass budget in massive objects ( i.e. with m@xmath2m@xmath3 ) .",
    "we suggest that merging events must play a key role in the _ mass pouring _ from disks to bulges .",
    "we find a different behavior of the ssfr , i.e. the star formation rate per unit stellar mass , as a function of redshift for the different morphological types .",
    "the median ssfr of late - type objects shows almost no evolution up to @xmath1 .",
    "conversely , median ssfrs for early and intermediate types increase systematically . since these latter morphological types are dominating in numbers , they drive the total sfr evolution of massive galaxies .",
    "this suggests a scenario where the morphological evolution of massive disk galaxies through merging is followed by the decrease of the star formation in their bulge  dominated descendants , maybe after a burst of star formation that exhausts the available gas .",
    "we wish to thank the referee for valuable comments that pushed us to strengthen our results and to improve their presentation .",
