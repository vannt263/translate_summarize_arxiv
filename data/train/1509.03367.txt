    "the traditional tools to learn about these resonances have been the use of pion beams @xcite , photon beams @xcite and also kaon beams @xcite .",

    ", the theoretical work goes parallel and many predictions are made .",
    "the quark models jumped earlier in this arena @xcite , but effective theories have also contributed their share @xcite .",
    "the quark models seem to over predict the number of baryon states , giving rise to the problem of the missing resonances .",
    "the effective theories give rise to some dynamically generated states as a consequence of the interaction of two hadrons , which fit some of the existing states , and also predict new states , most of them in the heavy sectors of charm and beauty .",
    "some of the predictions of these effective theories have been confirmed experimentally .",
    "one of the clear cases is the existence of two @xmath7 states , which were first reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and later on confirmed in all theories using the chiral unitary approach @xcite .",
    "the experimental confirmation came from the work of ref .",
    "@xcite and the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , but other experiments have come to confirm it too ( see the introduction ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) states in the next edition of the book ] .",
    "alternative , pictures for some @xmath8 states and the @xmath7 involving pentaquarks have also been invoked  @xcite . although not identical to the molecular representation , the need for more than standard three quarks is also deduced in those works .",
    "another one of these successful predictions is the existence of a @xmath9 state with spin zero at @xmath10 mev and a width of about 100 mev from the interaction of @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this state is also in agreement with the @xmath14 , with a similar width , discovered after the theoretical work in ref .",
    "the list of predicted states which has found experimental support have been found is long ( see ref .",
    "@xcite as an example ) .",
    "although it is premature to judge , the recent narrow pentaquark reported by the lhcb collaboration @xcite could maybe correspond to the predictions made of a hidden charm state in ref .",

    ". one should note that such borderline states are common and one of them , classified as a resonance in the pdg , is the @xmath16 , as found in ref .",
    "the existence of this state @xmath3 has also been claimed from a different perspective in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of the experiments that has brought some light on this state is the photoproduction of the @xmath7 undertaken in refs .",
    "@xcite and analysed in ref .",
    "the analyses in the experimental papers and in the theoretical ones differ in the predictions with respect to this state , although the two approaches lead to @xmath3 states .",

    "the result of ref .",
    "@xcite is that there is a state of @xmath3 , around the @xmath17 threshold , similar to the @xmath16 , visible as a strong cusp and in agreement with the findings of refs .",
    "it is clear that the extraction of this state is very problematic in conventional reactions which mix @xmath18 and @xmath3 , and make it difficult to disentangle the @xmath3 contribution which , however , is of great importance to understand why are there such large differences in the shapes of the mass distributions of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .    in view of these problems",
    "we propose here a completely different method , feasible in present experimental facilities .",
    "the reaction proposed is @xmath22 .",
    "the reaction @xmath23 has been measured at besiii  @xcite and cleo @xcite and the branching ratios are of order of @xmath24 . on the other hand , by looking at the pdg we find that the branching ratio for the analogous reaction @xmath25 is about three times larger than that of the @xmath26 , without @xmath27 production .",
    "one is then talking about branching ratios of the order of @xmath28 , easily accessible at besiii .",
    "given the quantum numbers of the @xmath29 , @xmath30 and the fact that the @xmath29 is a @xmath31 state , blind to su(3 ) , hence behaving like an su(3 ) singlet , since the @xmath32 has isospin @xmath3 , the @xmath33 state must have also @xmath3 , to combine to the @xmath18 of the @xmath29 .",
    "this is a good filter of isospin that guarantees that the @xmath33 will be in @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath3 state shows up more strongly in the @xmath34 amplitude than in @xmath35  @xcite , so the @xmath1 final state is the ideal channel within the approach used here .",
    "the idea followed here to filter @xmath3 has its precedent in the studies of @xmath36 decay into @xmath37 and a meson  @xcite . indeed",
    "since @xmath36 has @xmath18 and @xmath38 @xmath39 , the combination of @xmath40 and the meson will be in @xmath39 .",

    "@xcite to study the decays @xmath43 .",
    "we study the reaction and evaluate the @xmath33 mass distribution and we find that indeed , the filter works well and a clear signal for this state , with practically no background from the @xmath33 amplitude , is found .",
    "we then propose the implementation of this reaction which should settle this issue definitely and might result in the observation of a new baryon resonance in the light sector .",

    "<S> we present the theoretical study of the process @xmath0 decay , by taking into account the @xmath1 and @xmath2 final state interactions of the final meson - baryon pair based on the chiral unitary approach . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the process filters the isospin @xmath3 in the @xmath1 channel and offers a reaction to test the existence of an @xmath3 state with strangeness @xmath4 and spin - parity @xmath5 around the @xmath6 threshold predicted by some theories and supported by some experiments .    1.5pt </S>"
