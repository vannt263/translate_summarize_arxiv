    "layered materials is a wide class of compounds of very strong scientific and technological impact .",
    "these materials are composed of a stack of two - dimensional ( 2d ) conducting layers with weak interlayer electron coupling , determined by the interlayer transfer integral @xmath0 .",
    "such layered structure may be of natural molecular origin , as , e.g. , in cuprates , pnictides , organic metals or graphite , or of artificial origin , as in heterostructures or intercalated graphites .",
    "the small value of @xmath0 , which is much smaller than the in - plane fermi energy @xmath1 , provides these compounds with highly anisotropic electronic properties .",
    "magnetoresistance is traditionally used to explore the internal electron structure of metals.@xcite magnetoresistance in layered compounds has many special features .",
    "these are beats of magnetic quantum oscillations ( mqo),@xcite angular magnetoresistance oscillations ( amro),@xcite slow oscillations of magnetoresistance@xcite , the phase shift of beats of mqo , phsh , shub etc .",
    "the angular dependence of magnetoresistance is widely used to investigate the electronic structure of various layered compounds : organic metals ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "the amro are well understoodyam , yagi in the framework of the standard semiclassical 3d theory , based on the boltzmann transport equation , which gives the shockley - chambers formula@xcite for the angular dependence of magnetoresistance .",
    "the recent theoretical works@xcite on amro only provide the calculations based on this formula , which are useful for its practical application to extract the fermi - surface parameters from the experimental data .",
    "there is one important feature of the angular dependence of interlayer magnetoresistance , observed in various strongly anisotropic layered compounds , which can not be described in the framework of the standard 3d theory .",
    "this is the so - called coherent - incoherent transition of interlayer magnetoresistance , induced by disorder and by magnetic field component @xmath2 perpendicular to the conducting layers.wosnitzaprl2001,wosnitza2002,markprl2006,incoh2009 this transition occurs in layered compounds with extremely high quasi-2d anisotropy , namely , when the interlayer transfer integral @xmath0 is less than the cyclotron energy @xmath3 and than the landau level ( ll ) broadening @xmath4 due to impurities .",
    "this coherent - incoherent transition or crossover is sometimes accompanied by the metal - insulator transition@xcite and is always characterized by a strong growth of interlayer magnetoresistance @xmath5 with the increase of @xmath6,wosnitzaprl2001,wosnitza2002,markprl2006,incoh2009,zuo1999,nam2001 while the component @xmath7 of magnetic field parallel to the conducting layers only slightly affects the interlayer conductivity at weak magnetic field.@xcite it is important that @xmath8 grows not only in the maxima of mqo of magnetoresistance , when the chemical potential is situated in the gap between lls , but also in the minima of magnetoresistance , when the chemical potential is exactly on the lls and when there is no any gap of electron states at the fermi level .",
    "the 2d formula@xcite for the shubnikov - de haas effect , based on the standard 3d theory of interlayer magnetoresistance and applied to the extremely anisotropic quasi-2d limit , does not describe this effect .",
    "moreover , the first direct comparison between the magnetoresistance in the coherent 3d and the so - called `` weakly incoherent '' regimes did not reveal any considerable differences.@xcite recently it was shown , pdgprb2011,pdgwijetp2011,pdgfntwi2011 that although the initial model in ref .",
    "@xcite is valid for the weakly incoherent limit , the calculation of the electron green s functions in disordered 2d layer in ref .",
    "@xcite is incorrect , because the impurity scattering is incorrectly treated via a constant imaginary part of the electron self - energy similar to 3d case .",
    "more rigorous calculations show ( see , e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that in strong magnetic field , in addition to the oscillations due to ll quantization , the imaginary part of the electron self energy monotonically increases with magnetic field @xmath9.@xcite this monotonic increase leadspdgprb2011,pdgwijetp2011,pdgfntwi2011 to the similar increase of the dingle temperature and of the monotonic part of magnetoresistance @xmath10 , which also changes the angular dependence of magnetoresistance",
    ". this improvement@xcite of the theory can explain some experimental observations@xcite of the monotonic growth of interlayer magnetoresistance as function of @xmath2 when @xmath11 .",
    "however , in many compounds the much stronger than @xmath9 growth of interlayer magnetoresistance has been observed.wosnitzaprl2001,wosnitza2002,markprl2006,incoh2009,zuo1999,nam2001 to explain this rapid growth of @xmath12 , the variable - range hopping mechanism of interlayer electron transport has been proposed,@xcite similar to the in - layer transport in the regime of quantum hall effect ( qhe ) . although a reasonable agreement with experiment has been achieved in ref .",
    "@xcite basing on the semi - phenomenological consideration , the underlying theoretical model is still unclear .",
    "first , the actual electron interlayer hopping is not variable - range , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , but always to the adjacent layer , i.e. on the interlayer distance @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , the amro still exist in this limit , which means that during the interlayer hopping the in - plane electron wave function is conserved , i.e. the interlayer tunnelling term in the hamiltonian conserves the in - plane electron momentum .",
    "this hamiltonian is given by eqs .",
    "( [ h])-([hi ] ) below . without electron - electron ( e - e ) and electron - phonon ( e - ph ) interaction",

    "however , the comparison with some experiments shows that the results of refs .",
    "@xcite are applicable only in the intermediate magnetic fields , when @xmath14 , but the magnetic field is still too weak to induce the metal - insulator transition .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to generalize the model of ref .",
    "pdgprb2011 to describe the strong increase of interlayer magnetoresistance and the metal - insulator transition in very high magnetic field .",
    "the quasi-2d layered electron system with disorder and interaction is described by the following hamiltonian , which contains four main terms : @xmath15the first term @xmath16 is the hamiltonian of the noninteracting 2d electron gas in magnetic field summed over all layers . the second term in eq . ( [ h ] )",
    "gives the coherent electron tunnelling between two adjacent layers : @xmath17 ,   \\label{ht}\\]]where @xmath18 and @xmath19  are the creation ( annihilation ) operators of an electron on the layer @xmath20 at the point @xmath21 .",
    "this interlayer tunnelling hamiltonian is called `` coherent '' because it conserves the in - layer coordinate dependence of the electron wave function ( in other words , it conserves the in - plane electron momentum ) after the interlayer tunnelling .",
    "the third term@xmath22gives the electron interaction with impurity potential . the last term @xmath23 describes the electron - electron and electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the presence of this term differs our model from that in refs . @xcite . even without @xmath24 and for the case of point - like impurity potential , the exact solution of this hamiltonian is not achievable .",
    "after inclusion of the interaction term @xmath23 , we can only catch the main physical effects in this system to describe the interlayer electron transport .    in the limit , @xmath25 , the interlayer hopping @xmath0 can be considered as a small perturbation for the uncoupled stack of 2d metallic layers .",
    "the 2d disordered electron system in magnetic field has been extensively studied in connection to the quantum hall effect . with the increase of magnetic field the crossover from the diffusive dynamics and classical shubnikov - de haas effect to",

    "the in - plane electron dispersion is anisotropic , and the in - plane fs has the shape of elongated ellipse with semi - axes given by the wave vectors @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "then , in the absence of impurities , the electron classical orbit is also an ellipse with the main radii @xmath39this equation is a particular ( elliptic ) case of the well - known property that in magnetic field the electron orbits in coordinate and momentum spaces differ by the 90 degrees rotation only .",
    "the in - plane anisotropy of the localization length @xmath28 is the same as the anisotropy of the cyclotron radius @xmath40 , @xmath41 , because the electron diffusion along the conducting layer goes via the jumps from one cyclotron orbit to another due to impurity scattering , and the average jump distance is proportional to the size of the electron orbit in this direction .",
    "hence , the localization length in two main directions is @xmath42    any localized electron state is covered by a polaron , which comes from the static lattice deformation and from the rearrangement of the neighboring electrons . since the electron localization length @xmath43 is larger than the debye screening radius , the charge density @xmath44 induced by this polaron follows the square of the electron wave function amplitude @xmath45 .",
    "hence , this polaron creates a positive charge distributed on the area @xmath46along the interlayer direction the induced charge also follows the electron wave function @xmath47  and is distributed within one crystal layer , because otherwise there would be a nonuniform charge distribution along the @xmath48-axis .",
