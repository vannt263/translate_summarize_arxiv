    "nematic liquid crystals are the simplest paradigm for anisotropic fluids ; i.e. liquids with a preferred direction of the orientation of molecules with anisotropic shape which is described by the director field @xmath2 .",
    "the anisotropy of their dielectric properties allows controlling the director by electric fields .",
    "the ( usually homogeneous ) reorientation of the director by a properly applied voltage changes the direction of the optical axis and hence the light transmittance of the sample ; this forms the physical background of the liquid crystal displays , @xcite used widespread in common electronic devices .    applying an electric voltage to a nematic liquid crystal layer can , however , often result in the appearance of spatio - temporal , periodic or disordered structures too .",
    "the conditions of their occurrence , the pattern morphologies and their onset characteristics have been extensively studied since decades , both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .    in the mostly studied planar configuration , where the director is initially oriented parallel to the confining plates , one of the electric field induced patterns corresponds to spatially periodic , equilibrium director deformations ( seen as stripes parallel to the director in a polarizing microscope ) , occurring due to a flexoelectric free energy gain of the deformed state ; therefore they have been coined _ flexoelectric domains _ ( fds ) @xcite .",
    "fds have so far been detected in a few nematic compounds only and they are observable at dc ( or very low frequency ac ) driving only .",
    "a more frequent , but also more complex pattern forming phenomenon is the electroconvection ( ec ) where the director distortions are accompanied by space charge separation and hence by material flow ; thus having a dissipative character .",
    "it could be observed in many nematics , some of which possess substantially different material properties @xcite .",
    "ec patterns could be induced in a wide frequency range of the applied voltage ( ranging from dc up to several hundreds khz ac ) ; the resulting convection rolls are seen in a polarizing microscope as stripes whose direction may be normal to , oblique or parallel with the director .",
    "up to now studies were mostly focussed on the class of nematics with negative dielectric and positive conductivity anisotropies and on driving frequencies @xmath3 within the range of 10 hz to 10 khz . in this @xmath3 range evolution of the pattern",
    "requires numerous driving periods after voltage application . for such conditions the variation of pattern morphologies ( conductive and dielectric regimes , oblique and normal rolls ) upon the amplitude and frequency of the applied voltage have been explored in detail and the mechanism as an electrohydrodynamic instability has been well understood . a quantitative theoretical description of the pattern threshold , the critical wave vector and some secondary transitions ( e.g. abnormal rolls ) could be given combining nematodynamics with electrodynamics under the simplifying assumption of ohmic conductivity  now called as the standard model of ec @xcite  or via its extensions by flexoelectricity @xcite or by ionic diffusion / recombination @xcite .",
    "recently interest has arisen to study the behaviour in another , subhertz frequency range , where the pattern growth / decay times are ( much ) shorter than the driving period , using compounds which may exhibit both ec and fd patterns .",
    "it has been proven experimentally that at such ultralow frequencies both for the dielectric @xcite and the conductive @xcite ec regimes , as well as for the fd @xcite the patterns are flashing , i.e. they exist only in a small part of the driving period .",
    "it has been found that there is an @xmath3 range ( @xmath4 mhz ) where both ec and fd patterns can exist in each driving half period in the form of successive ( time shifted ) flashes .",
    "theoretical calculations based on the standard model of ec extended with flexoelectricity @xcite ( which is able to describe fds too @xcite ) have justified that flashing patterns are indeed the solutions of the nemato - electrohydrodynamic equations at ultralow @xmath3 .",
    "the calculated position of the fd flashes within the driving half period showed quantitative matches with the experiments , while for the position of the ec flashes the frequency dependence was only qualitatively reproduced by the calculations , as the ec flashes come earlier within the period than expected @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present further experimental results on the ultralow @xmath3 behaviour , however , in a different system than those reported before .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : exp ] introduces our compound and the experimental method .",
    "the new findings are grouped around three subtopics : section  [ sec : results:1 ] reports on the temporal evolution of the patterns within the period ; section  [ sec : results:2 ] deals with the frequency dependence of the threshold characteristics and section  [ sec : results : tempdep ] provides data on the temperature dependence of various material parameters . finally the paper is concluded in section  [ sec : concl ] with a summary and some closing remarks .",
    "our measurements have been performed on the nematic liquid crystal 4-n - octyloxyphenyl 4-n - methyloxybenzoate ( 1oo8 ) that shows only a nematic mesophase .",
    "the chemical structure of 1oo8 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1oo8 ] .        in heating",
    "it melts to nematic from the crystalline phase at 63.5 @xmath5c , while the clearing point ( @xmath6 ) equals to 76.7 @xmath5c .",
    "the nematic phase can be supercooled down to 53@xmath5c .",
    "the material parameters of 1oo8 , such as the dielectric anisotropy ( @xmath7 ) , the optical anisotropy ( @xmath8 ) , the anisotropy of the diamagnetic susceptibility ( @xmath9 ) , and the bulk elastic constants ( @xmath10 ) were determined as the function of temperature using a method based on magnetic and electric freedericksz - transitions @xcite . here",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the dielectric permittivity and the refractive index , respectively ; the subscripts @xmath13 and @xmath14 correspond to measurement directions parallel with and perpendicular to the director .",
    "the compound was investigated in commercial sandwich cells ( e.h.c .",
    "co. ) with ito electrodes coated with rubbed polyimide layers for planar alignment .",
    "the electrode area was 1 @xmath15 .",
    "the thickness of the empty cells ( @xmath16 @xmath17 m ) was measured by an ocean optics spectrophotometer . during the measurements",
    "the temperature of the sample was kept constant within 0.01 @xmath5c in an instec hsi heat stage controlled with an mk-1 board .",
    "the sample was driven by a sinusoidal voltage @xmath18 of an agilent 33120a function generator via a high - voltage amplifier : @xmath19 .",
    "the electric field induced patterns were observed by a leica dm rx polarizing microscope in transmission mode with white light illumination using the shadowgraph technique @xcite ( the polarizer was removed , while the analyser was set to be parallel with the rubbing direction ) .",
    "the imaging system was equipped with an eosens mc1362 high speed camera interfaced by an inspecta-5 frame grabber . after waiting one or two periods of the driving signal following the application of the voltage to the sample ( or waiting 5 seconds at frequencies higher than 0.2 hz ) ,",
    "a sequence of 1000 images was recorded .",
    "the acquisition of the first image was triggered by the zero crossing ( from negative to positive ) of the applied voltage .",
    "in addition to the optical observations the electric current through the cell was monitored by measuring the voltage drop on a relatively small , known resistance connected in series with the sample .",
    "simultaneously the driving waveform was also recorded by a tiepie handyscope hs3 oscilloscope .",
    "the data acquisition and processing system was fully automated .",
    "applying a low frequency ( e.g. @xmath20 mhz ) sinusoidal voltage to the cell , patterns appear above a threshold voltage in a narrow time window in each half period of driving .",
    "two distinct pattern morphologies were found with different thresholds , similarly to previous observations on other nematics @xcite .",
    "representative snapshots of the patterns and their 2-dimensional ( 2-d ) fourier transforms ( the spectral intensities ) are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : patterns ] . the two morphologies can be attributed to oblique conductive ec rolls ( a zig - zag pattern , fig .",

    "it is necessary to provide a proper definition for the pattern contrast , which has a minimum ( ideally zero ) in the homogeneous state and increases as the pattern emerges .",
    "a common procedure is to perform a 2-d fourier transformation of the images in order to find the critical wave vector @xmath21 of the pattern ( where the fourier amplitudes have maxima ) and to define the contrast @xmath22 as the sum of the spectral intensities in a region around @xmath23 .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : patterns ] that the two pattern types observed in 1oo8 ( ec and fd ) are characterized by different @xmath23 vectors , i.e. they are well separated in the fourier space .",
    "therefore this contrast definition allows distinguishing them not only from the initial homogeneous state , but also between each other .",
    "alternatively , a mean square deviation of the image intensities , @xmath24 , may also serve as a measure of the contrast . here",
    "@xmath25 is the intensity of an individual pixel and @xmath26 denotes averaging over the whole image .",
    "this definition is simpler , though it has the disadvantage of not being able to distinguish various pattern morphologies .",
    "actually @xmath27 would coincide with @xmath22 if the summation of the spectral intensities were extended over the whole fourier space .",
    "obtained by fourier technique ; ( b ) for the contrast @xmath27 calculated from the square deviation ; and ( c ) for the electrical current @xmath28 through the liquid crystal .",
    "@xmath29 corresponds to the zero crossing ( from positive to negative ) of the applied voltage .",
    "the dashed - dotted lines show that the peaks of ec and of the current coincide.,width=302 ]    figure  [ fig : c_i_t ] exhibits and compares the time dependence of contrast within a driving period for both definitions given above , measured in a @xmath30 m thick cell at @xmath31 @xmath5c driven by an @xmath32 mhz , @xmath33 v voltage .",
    "figure  [ fig : c_i_t]a shows @xmath22 obtained by the fourier method for the ec ( solid line ) and the fd ( dashed line ) patterns .",
    "both curves exhibit a single peak in each half period , but at different time intervals ; hence these two pattern types are well separated not only in the fourier space , but in time as well . in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_i_t]b the contrast @xmath27 calculated by the square deviation is plotted .",
    "this curve has two , well separated peaks per half period ( looks similar to the superposition of the two curves in fig .  [ fig : c_i_t]a ) ; thus can also be used to detect the appearance of both pattern types . therefore , for simplicity , in the following we will use @xmath27 as the measure of the contrast of the patterns .    figure  [ fig : c_i_t]c depicts the time dependence of the electrical current which was measured simultaneously with image acquisition . at this @xmath3 and @xmath34 the current is highly nonlinear ; it can be characterized by sharp peaks rather than by a harmonic response .",
    "it can be deduced from the figure that , surprisingly , the location of the maxima of the current peaks coincide precisely with the contrast peaks corresponding to the ec flashes ( see the dash - dotted vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_i_t ] ) .",
    "numerous different voltages , frequencies and temperatures were tested .",
    "though at various conditions the time instant of the ec flash may change @xcite , it still equals to that of the current peak ; thus we can conclude that this is not an accidental coincidence .",
    "we suggest that the current spikes trigger the emergence of the ec pattern .",
    "therefore it appears earlier within the half period ( a phase - locking behaviour ) than expected otherwise .",
    "we note that the spiky behaviour of the current is not a consequence of the appearance of the ec pattern .",
    "current spikes have been detected at low voltages ( much below any pattern threshold ) where no patterns are observable and also in the isotropic phase .",
    "we think that the nonlinear current behaviour is due to ionic effects and to the presence of insulating polyimide orienting layers on the electrode surfaces of the cell .",
    "the presence of ( relatively low ) concentration of ionic impurities in the nematic makes it to behave as a weak electrolyte . in the studied ultralow frequency range the current due to the linear impedance of the cell ( i.e. the capacitive and the ohmic components ) is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the transient currents due to building or destroying the debye screening layers near the electrodes ;",
    "the latter occurs at each polarity reversal of the voltage .    in order to describe the behaviour of weak electrolytes in electric fields",
    "several models were developed , differing in their sets of assumptions @xcite ; i.e. they take into consideration different subsets of the possible effects listed below : generation and recombination of ions ; different mobilities , diffusion coefficients and charges of ionic species ; surface adsorption ; charge injection ; chemical reactions ; voltage attenuation due to the orienting layers ; etc . due to the complexity of the models they mostly focused on the linear response and calculated the low frequency complex impedance which could be compared to low @xmath3 dielectric spectroscopy data .",
    "recently theoretical calculations of the nonlinear current characteristics in response to a low frequency sinusoidal voltage driving were also reported @xcite , yielding curves similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_i_t]c , however , without comparison with experiments .",
    "this gives the hope that after measurements or intelligent guesses of the unknown material parameters of the model the measured current response can be reproduced ; it is remaining a task for the future .",
    "the nematic being a weak electrolyte has consequences on the pattern formation processes .",
    "it was shown that the weak electrolyte model ( wem ) of ec @xcite , which considers ionic dissociation and recombination , can account for the travelling of ec roll patterns found occasionally at frequencies above a few tens hz .",
    "this model has not yet been analysed for low driving frequencies ; due to its high complexity it remains a challenge for the future to decide whether it is able to describe the phase locking of ec flashes to current spikes .",
    "flexodomains and electroconvection both are threshold phenomena ; i.e. the patterns with a critical wavenumber @xmath35 occur above a threshold voltage @xmath36 .",
    "determination of @xmath36 and @xmath37 is therefore the primary task at pattern characterization . at high frequencies ( @xmath38 hz ) for @xmath39 patterns usually develop within seconds ; therefore thresholds can easily be estimated by increasing @xmath34 as the voltage at which the pattern becomes perceptible by eyes in the microscope .",
    "this simple technique practically does not work at our ultralow frequency driving , since the driving period is quite long and in addition the patterns appear as flashes , which means they can be observed only in a short time window .    in order to determine @xmath36 precisely one has to follow quantitatively the emergence of patterns from the homogenous state ; i.e. to record and then analyse the contrast - voltage curves . as the contrast varies within the driving period ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_i_t]b ) , the maximum @xmath40 of the contrast @xmath27 in the fd ( or ec ) peak can be regarded as a measure to what extent the fd ( or ec ) pattern has been developed at a given applied voltage .    in an ideal case ( perfect bifurcation )",
    "the contrast @xmath40 should be zero at voltages below the threshold .",
    "experimentally a nonzero background contrast @xmath41 is always found even in the homogeneous state at no applied voltage ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "this background contrast comes from various sources : the electronic noise of the camera , the thermal fluctuation of the director in a planar nematic , imperfections of the orientation or inhomogeneity of the illumination .",
    "this background was automatically subtracted from each data point ; thus it will not be indicated in the forthcoming figures .",
    "as the voltage is increased above @xmath43 , the initial planar director orientation @xmath44 becomes unstable and a spatially periodic director distortion @xmath45 $ ] appears . here",
    "@xmath46 is a linear eigenvector , @xmath47 characterize the amplitude of the distortion , and @xmath48 is the wavevector of the pattern .",
    "the spatially periodic director distortion results in a shadowgraph image whose intensity modulation @xmath49 depends on the amplitude of the vertical distortion @xmath50 . for small distortion amplitudes ( not too far from threshold )",
    "the intensity modulation in the leading order is given@xcite by @xmath51 with the first order amplitude term and the second order phase term . for ec patterns ( normal rolls with @xmath52 )",
    "the linear term is dominating and @xmath53 . in case of fd , where @xmath54 , the relevant contribution to the shadowgraph intensity is of the second order : @xcite @xmath55 .",
    "the contrast of the shadowgraph image defined as the mean square deviation of the image intensities is then @xmath56 .",
    "thus the maximum of the contrast within the driving period is expected to be @xmath57 for an ec pattern and @xmath58 for the fd @xcite . in the vicinity of the threshold @xmath59",
    "; therefore @xmath60 as well as @xmath61 should grow linearly with the voltage .",
    "figure  [ fig : c_u_fd ] shows the measured @xmath62 curves for a few frequencies .",
    "it is seen that the linear relation near the threshold is obeyed quite well ; though the transition is smeared a little ( due to imperfections and/or the occurrence of subcritical fluctuations ) .",
    "therefore the threshold voltage @xmath63 is actually determined by a linear extrapolation , as the intersection of the horizontal axis with the line fitted onto the linear section of the @xmath64 curve slightly above the suspected threshold .",
    "this procedure is going to be referred as method a.        the voltage dependence of @xmath60 for ec is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_u_ec ] for several driving frequencies .",
    "it is clearly seen that the frequency affects not only the threshold voltages , but also the character ( the shape ) of the @xmath65 curves .",
    "evidently the linear relation holds only at high frequencies ; there the thresholds @xmath66 can be determined by extrapolation ( method a ) .",
    "of ec for different frequencies ( symbols ) .",
    "solid lines are fits with the imperfect bifurcation model , the dashed lines indicate the linear extrapolation.,width=302 ]    below 1 hz , however , there is no sharp increase of the contrast ; the @xmath64 curves show rather a slow gradual increase , while the contrast levels and thus the visibility of the patterns vary in the same range as at high frequencies .",
    "the determination of thresholds is then not so straightforward . in lack of a well defined linear part of the contrast curve ,",
    "method a becomes unreliable ; the choice of points used for the extrapolation ( the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_u_ec ] ) is to some extent arbitrary .    an alternative way ( method b )",
    "is to select ( arbitrarily ) a critical contrast value @xmath67 ( the dash - dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_u_ec ] ) where the ec pattern is visible by eye .",
    "the voltage @xmath68 , where @xmath69 , can be regarded as another estimate of the threshold . in case of forward bifurcations , which the standard ec pattern formation is an example for , the contrast increases continuously from zero .",
    "therefore @xmath68 slightly overestimates the threshold .",
    "the change in the shape of the @xmath65 curves may be interpreted so that the nearly perfect bifurcation ( at high @xmath3 ) becomes imperfect at lower @xmath3 .",
    "for an imperfect bifurcation the amplitude of the director distortion @xmath70 satisfies the equation    @xmath71    here @xmath72 , @xmath34 is the rms applied voltage , @xmath73 is the threshold voltage , @xmath74 characterizes the saturation of the amplitude and @xmath75 is the measure for the imperfection ( @xmath76 corresponds to the perfect forward bifurcation ) . for @xmath77 and @xmath78 only one of the three solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ampleq1 ] ) is stable in the whole range of @xmath79 and thus relevant ; it reads as    @xmath80    as mentioned above , the maximum contrast @xmath60 of the ec patterns observed using the shadowgraph technique is proportional to @xmath81 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : a02_u ] the dependence of @xmath81 on the applied voltage @xmath34 is shown for different values of the imperfection parameter @xmath82 at fixed values of @xmath73 and @xmath83 .",

    "the actual value of the scaling parameter @xmath93 is determined by the optical set - up and the optical properties . as @xmath94 of the ec pattern depends weakly on @xmath3",
    ", we can assume that @xmath93 is frequency independent .",

    "[ fig : delta_f ] .",
    "it clearly shows ",
    "what we have already expected from the experimental data in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_u_ec ]  that the imperfection grows at lower frequencies .",
    "several reasons could be responsible for the increase of the apparent imperfection .    in planar samples aligned by rubbed polyimide layers",
    "a small director pretilt at the confining plates is practically unavoidable .",
    "such pretilt is known to yield imperfect bifurcation ( i.e. lack of a sharp threshold ) in the case of splay freedericksz - transition .",
    "the effect of a tilted alignment on the ec characteristics has theoretically been studied only for high frequencies @xcite ; the pretilt modified @xmath43 , but did not affect the sharpness of the threshold , which is in agreement with our observations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : c_u_ec ] ) at high @xmath3 .    decreasing the frequency of the applied ac voltage well below the inverse director relaxation time",
    "may , however , alter the situation as one enters the regime of quasistatic director response . here a small pretilt may enhance the director deformations and correspondingly the contrast of the pattern can develop already at lower voltage amplitudes compared to the high frequency case .",
    "unfortunately a detailed theoretical analysis of this regime in the presence of pretilt is not yet available .    the nonlinear electric current characteristics presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results:1 ] may provide another reason for the apparent softening of the ultra - low @xmath3 ec thresholds .",
    "the coincidence of the electric current peaks and the ec flashes clearly shows the strong correlation between pattern formation and ionic phenomena : the massive ionic flow helps the electro - hydrodynamical instability to emerge .",
    "the spatial distribution of the current is not necessarily uniform , mainly due to surface inhomogeneities ( which may originate e. g. from crystallization of the compound ) or small variations in the cell thickness and/or pretilt .",
    "the current inhomogeneities may locally reduce the threshold of ec .",
    "in fact this effect has been observed : the ec pattern first appears in germs and extends gradually to larger area by increasing the voltage .",
    "the location of these germs can be identified even in the well developed pattern as small spots / patches of higher contrast ( a few such spots can be seen in fig",
    ".  [ fig : patterns]a ) .",
    "the contrast @xmath65 of the pattern plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : c_u_ec ] is calculated over the whole image ; thus a continuous increase of the area filled with pattern leads to a continuous increase of @xmath65 .",
    "consequently a locally sharp transition yields a softened , gradual contrast variation .",
    "while ionic effects are mostly negligible at high frequencies ( linear current response ) , they become crucial at ultralow frequencies ( spiky current response ) , which may explain the increase of the imperfection parameter for @xmath96 .",
    "we note that the formation of flexodomains is not affected by the electric current spikes as they occur in different time windows .",
    "therefore the above scenario of germ - induced pattern evolution does not apply to fd ; i.e. the onset of fd remains sharp over the full frequency range of its existence , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : flexo ] .",
    "the frequency dependence of the threshold voltages of both patterns can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : uth_f ] .",
    "it depicts the @xmath73 values determined by all three methods introduced above .",
    "the data by methods a ( extrapolation ) and b ( comparison ) almost coincide , while the thresholds obtained from fitting to the imperfect bifurcation model are significantly larger at lower frequencies .",
    "this is not surprising since methods a and b intrinsically assume that no deformation exists below a threshold , while an imperfect bifurcation actually means a thresholdless deformation with @xmath43 being a parameter only",
    ".    otherwise the @xmath97 curve exhibits the expected behaviour .",
    "the reduction of the threshold at lowering @xmath3 in the @xmath98 hz range corresponds to the theoretical predictions and matches the behaviour of other nematics @xcite .",
    "the increase of @xmath73 toward ultralow frequencies is attributed to the internal attenuation due to the insulating polyimide alignment layers on the electrodes @xcite .",
    "the frequency dependence of @xmath63 seems to be significantly weaker than that of @xmath73 in the same @xmath3 range .",
    "taking into account the internal attenuation , the actual fd threshold voltage ( on the liquid crystal layer ) grows much stronger with @xmath3 than the apparent threshold plotted in the figure ( the voltage applied to the cell ) , which is in agreement with the theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : uth_f ] clearly shows that the two distinct patterns , ec and fds , coexist in a relatively wide ( 0.02 hz @xmath99 0.4 hz ) range , even though their threshold voltages are quite different .",
    "this is possible , because they remain separated in time until the half period of driving voltage is large enough for both patterns to emerge and decay ; thus they can build up from the same almost homogenous initial state . for @xmath100 hz , however , this does not hold any more . in that range , besides the shorter period time , @xmath73 is much lower than @xmath63 .",
    "thus the ec contrast spikes become much broader and the ec pattern does not decay fully before fd should emerge . under such condition the fd pattern ( which has a lower contrast than ec ) can not be recognized any more .    as the frequency",
    "is reduced , at around @xmath101 hz there is an intersection of the two threshold curves ( @xmath63 and @xmath73 ) . at @xmath3 below this intersection",
    "the threshold of fds is lower than that of ec ; thus upon increasing the voltage fd is the first instability , ec sets on at a higher voltage .",
    "this is in accordance with the finding that when applying a pure dc voltage , no ec pattern , only fds can be detected .",
    "characterization of the threshold behaviour is incomplete without addressing the frequency dependence of the critical wave number @xmath102 .",
    "figure  [ fig : qth_f ] exhibits the relevant curves both for ec ( @xmath103 ) and fd ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "the values were determined using the 2-d fast fourier transformation ( fft ) of images taken slightly above the threshold , at @xmath105 , in order to have sufficient contrast for the evaluation .",
    "note that for the oblique ec rolls @xmath106 , while fds are parallel to the initial director , so @xmath107 .",
    "the wave numbers increase for both patterns with the frequency . in the case of fd",
    "there is a moderate @xmath3 dependence even at ultralow frequencies . for ec ,",
    "the change of @xmath103 seems to be very small until 5 hz . between 5 and 10 hz , however , the wave number increases suddenly , which is attributed to the transition between oblique conductive and oblique dielectric ec . to our knowledge",
    "no such transition was reported before in the literature .",
    "we note that the obliqueness angle decreases with the frequency , the lifshitz - point is reached in the dielectric regime at @xmath108 hz .      though several experimental methods have been proposed to measure the flexoelectric coefficients , measurements usually can not be done without serious compromises @xcite .",
    "analysis of the threshold parameters ( @xmath109 , @xmath63 ) of the flexoelectric instability is one of the possible methods .",
    "its drawback is that only a few compounds exhibit this effect , because : 1 ) the material needs to have a quite low dielectric anisotropy ( @xmath110 ) , 2 ) the concentration of its ionic impurities should be sufficiently low in order to avoid large screening effects , 3 ) other phenomena ( e.g. ec or freedericksz - transition ) should not influence the homogenous planar initial state below the threshold of fd .",
    "the threshold characteristics for dc driving voltage have long ago been calculated analytically @xcite using the one - elastic - constant approximation ( @xmath111 ) :    @xmath112    @xmath113    where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the splay and bend flexoelectric coefficients , respectively , and @xmath116    according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : pikinq ] ) the flexodomains can only exist for the material parameter combination @xmath117 .",
    "this leads to the requirement @xmath118 that should be valid for materials showing fds . combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pikinq ] ) and ( [ eq : mu ] ) yields :    @xmath119    for 1oo8 both @xmath120 and @xmath121 were measured as the function of temperature using 10 mhz ac sine voltage .",

    "we have investigated the pattern forming phenomena induced by ultralow frequency sinusoidal voltages applied onto the calamitic nematic liquid crystal 1oo8 .",
    "it was found that the behaviour in this low frequency range is characteristically different from that typical for high frequencies : here patterns appear as flashes in a short time interval within each half period of driving .",
    "two kinds of pattern morphologies were detected : electroconvection rolls and flexodomains .",
    "the types of patterns differ in their wave vector ( ec rolls are oblique to , whiles fds are parallel with the initial director ) ; moreover their flashes occur subsequently with a time separation , though in the same ( and each ) half period of driving .",
    "these scenarios are similar to those reported recently @xcite for the nematic mixtures phase 5 and phase 4 .",
    "electric current measurements carried out simultaneously to pattern recording indicated strongly nonlinear current responses : the time dependence of the current showed sharp peaks after each polarity reversal of the applied voltage .",
    "the current nonlinearity in 1oo8 was much more pronounced than in phase 5 .",
    "this behaviour is attributed to the ionic conductivity of the liquid crystal .",
    "the transient current may be due to the motion of ions during building up a debye screening layer at the electrodes , while the ( insulating ) polyimide coating ensuring the planar alignment blocks the charge transfer through the electrodes .",
    "we found that , interestingly , the time instant of the flashing ec patterns ( the time of the ec contrast peak ) and that of the electric current peak coincide .",
    "this coincidence holds for all voltages , frequencies and temperatures that we have tested .",
    "the shape of the current signal is not affected by the occurrence of ec significantly , indicating that it originates from the more robust ionic effects described above .",
    "this is also supported by the fact , that the current peaks could be observed below as well as above the ec threshold , and even in the isotropic phase .",
    "we think , that the current peak has a significant effect on the formation of ec , but not vice versa ; the appearance of the ec flashes is synchronized to the current peaks .",
    "recently we reported a comparison @xcite between the measured and the theoretically calculated time instant of the ec flashes for phase 5 .",
    "it indicated that in the experiment at ultralow @xmath3 ec occurred earlier within the half period than expected from the extended standard model of ec @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the phase locking of ec to the ionic current peaks might be the reason for this mismatch ( the extended standard model does not consider ionic effects ) .",
    "we guess that an adequate extension of the theory to weak electrolytes could reveal this problem and additionally explain the role of the robust current peaks in the pattern formation ; proving that , however , represents a great theoretical challenge for the future .",
    "studying the threshold characteristics of the patterns we found that the behaviour of ec and fd are essentially different .",
    "flexodomains have a sharp threshold , i.e. the pattern contrast increases suddenly for @xmath157 . for ec",
    "this holds only at high @xmath3 ; reducing the frequency the ec threshold becomes gradually less sharp ( the contrast changes smoothly with the voltage ) . on the one hand it hinders the precise determination of the ec threshold . on the other hand",
    ", we showed that this tendency can be followed quantitatively using an imperfect bifurcation model . in this approach the amount of imperfection increases as the frequency is lowered .",
    "ec and fd have different frequency dependence of their thresholds . at high @xmath3",
    "the ec threshold is lower , while at dc driving flexodomains are seen .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that there is a crossover between ec and fd at around 60 mhz , where their thresholds become equal .",
    "such a scenario was already anticipated from measurements on phase 5 , but could first be demonstrated explicitly now on 1oo8 .",
    "interestingly , the two kinds of patterns can appear in the same half period in some frequency range on both sides of the crossover point , including frequencies where the two thresholds are quite different .",
    "this is made possible by the narrow time interval and time separation of the flashes .",
    "the @xmath158 curve of 1oo8 shows a discontinuity at @xmath159 hz , indicating a crossover from conductive to dielectric convection rolls . interestingly , unlike similar crossovers reported at high frequencies in other compounds , here both the conductive and the dielectric rolls are oblique around this crossover frequency ; consequently the lifshitz - frequency is located in the dielectric regime .",
    "though oblique dielectric rolls have already been reported recently in phase 4 ( which had no conductive regime at all ) @xcite , to our knowledge 1oo8 is the first substance which exhibits the transition from oblique conductive to oblique dielectric rolls with increasing the frequency of the ac voltage .",
    "the low @xmath160 indicates a fairly low electrical conductivity which also helps distinguishing between ec and fd patterns by increasing their time separation and may also be responsible for the enhanced nonlinearity of the current .",
    "measuring the critical wave number of the flexoelectric domains offers a way to calculate the combination @xmath123 of the flexoelectric coefficients using theoretical models based either on the one - elastic - constant approximation or on a rigourous handling of anisotropic elasticity .",
    "it has turned out that the values determined by the two methods differ only by about 7% .",
    "the reason for this small difference is that the relevant material parameters ( @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath124 ) of 1oo8 fall into that range , where @xmath109 is only slightly sensitive to the elastic anisotropy .",
    "the threshold voltages of fds , calculated from the theoretical models using the above values of @xmath123 , show a satisfactory agreement with the measured data ; this proves the consistency of the models .    in cooling 1oo8",
    "has a nematic temperature range of about 25 degrees .",
    "the temperature dependence of the elastic moduli , the dielectric and the magnetic anisotropies was determined for the whole nematic range . for @xmath123 data",
    "could be obtained only for the lower temperature part of the nematic phase as flexodomains did not exist for @xmath161 @xmath162c .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath123 was compared with that of @xmath125 ; the latter being proportional to @xmath132 .",
    "it was found that @xmath163 is satisfied , as it is expected from the molecular theory of dipolar flexoelectricity , and also the proportionality constant was determined .",
