    "( notation : @xmath2 ) if for any positive numbers @xmath3 and @xmath4 the following identity is satisfied : @xmath5 where @xmath6 are independent vectors distributed as @xmath0 and @xmath7 denotes equality in distribution . using @xmath8 in the above definition",
    ", the stability property can be equivalently expressed as @xmath9 for any @xmath10 $ ] .    in a recent work @xcite the authors of this paper explored the notion of strict stability for a much more general situation of random elements taking values in a commutative semigroup @xmath11 .",
    "stability property relies on two basic operations defined on @xmath11 : the semigroup operation : addition and the rescaling which plays a role of multiplication by numbers .",
    "many properties of the classical stability still hold for this general situation , but there are many notable differences related to specific algebraic properties of @xmath11 , e.g.  the validity of distributivity laws , relation between the zero and the neutral elements , compactness , etc .",
    "most importantly , the stable random elements arise as a sum of points of a poisson process which intensity measure has a specific scalable form . in the classical case of @xmath12-dimensional vectors",
    ", this result turns into the _ lepage representation _ of strictly @xmath1-stable laws : any such law corresponds to the distribution of the sum of points of a poisson process @xmath13 in @xmath14 with the density ( intensity ) function having a product form @xmath15 in the polar coordinates @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 is any finite measure on the unit sphere @xmath18 called the _ spectral measure _ , and @xmath19 .",
    "the underlying reason is that the process @xmath13 is itself stable with respect to scaling and superposition , i.e. @xmath20 this property being granted by the measure @xmath21 that scales in a ` right ' way and the superposition property of poisson processes .",
    "this fundamental stability property leads to a characterisation of strictly stable laws in very general abelian semigroups forming a cone with respect to rescaling with a continuous argument @xmath22 , see  @xcite .",
    "the case of discrete spaces , however , can not be treated the same way since the scaling by a continuous argument can not be defined in such spaces . while infinite divisibility of random elements in general semigroups , at least in the commutative case , is well understood ,",
    "see @xcite , a systematic exploration of stable laws on possibly discrete semigroups is not available .",
    "this prompts to define rescaling as a direct transformation of probability distributions rather than being inherited from rescaling of the underlying phase space of the random elements .",
    "before the current work the family @xmath23 of non - negative integers with addition was the only discrete semigroup for which stability was defined .",
    "the discrete stability concept for non - negative integer valued random variables was introduced by steutel and van  harn  @xcite . since multiplication by any real positive @xmath24",
    "can not be directly defined on @xmath23 , the result of rescaling becomes a probability measure .",
    "namely , the result @xmath25 of rescaling of @xmath26 by @xmath10 $ ] becomes the binomial probability measure @xmath27 with convention that @xmath28 for any @xmath29 .",
    "recall that @xmath27 corresponds to the sum of @xmath29 independent bernoulli random variables @xmath30 with parameter @xmath24 . since one can view @xmath29 as the total count of positive integers between @xmath31 and @xmath29 , a number sampled from @xmath27",
    "can then be regarded as total count of integers between @xmath31 and @xmath29 where each number is counted with probability @xmath24 independently of others . in terms of random variables , a random variable @xmath0 with distribution @xmath32",
    "is mapped to a random variable @xmath33 having distribution of @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a sequence of independent bernoulli @xmath30-distributed random variables .",
    "thus @xmath33 can be viewed as a doubly - stochastic random variable whose distribution depends on realisations of @xmath0 .    alternatively ,",
    "if @xmath36 denotes the probability generating function ( p.g.f . ) of @xmath0 , then the  of @xmath33 is given by the composition of @xmath37 and the  of bernoulli @xmath30 law : @xmath38    similar to  , a random variable @xmath0 is called _ discrete @xmath1-stable _ if for all @xmath39 the following identity is satisfied @xmath40 where @xmath41 are independent copies of @xmath0 , see @xcite .",
    "the full characterisation of discrete @xmath1-stable random variables ( denoted by @xmath42 in the sequel ) is provided in  @xcite , where it is shown that the laws satisfying  ( [ eq : dstabdef ] ) exist only for @xmath43 $ ] and each such law has a  of the form @xmath44 for some @xmath45 .    in this paper",
    "we show that the discrete stability of non - negative integer random variables is a particular case of stability with respect to the thinning operation of point processes defined on a rather general phase space .",
    "if the phase space consists of just one element , a point process may have multiple points , their total number is a non - negative integer random variable and the thinning of the points is equivalent to the above defined scaling operation @xmath46 on discrete random variables .",
    "all known properties of discrete stable laws have their more general counterparts in point process settings .",
    "in particular , we show in section  [ sec : stab - with - resp ] that @xmath1-stable point processes with respect to thinning are , in fact , cox processes with the ( random ) parametric measure being a positive @xmath1-stable measure with @xmath47 $ ] . because of this reason we first address general strictly stable random measures in section  [ sec : strictly - stable - rand ] .",
    "note in this relation that so far only _ independently scattered _ stable measures received much attention in the literature , see @xcite and more recently @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the central result is theorem  [ th : coxpros ] which shows that discrete stable point processes are exactly cox processes driven by a strictly stable random measure on the phase space .",
    "it should be noted that cox processes driven by various random measures are often used in spatial statistics , see @xcite .",
    "a particular feature of discrete stable processes is that the point counts have discrete @xmath1-stable distributions , which have infinite expectations unless @xmath48 .",
    "it is known that discrete stable random variables can be represented as the sum of poisson number of sibuya distributed integer random variables , see  @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : poiss - mixt - repr ] we show that an analogous cluster representation of finite discrete stable point processes also holds .",
    "the clusters are sibuya point processes which seem to be a new class of point processes not considered so far .    some of our results for general point processes , especially defined on a non - compact spaces do not have , however , counterparts for discrete random variables or become trivial .",
    "this concerns the results of section  [ sec : infinite - das - point ] which draws analogy with infinitely divisible point processes .",
    "another important model arising from the general point process setting is the case of random elements in discrete semigroups which possess at most countable basis .",
    "we show in section  [ sec : settings ] that the uniqueness of representation of each element as a linear finite combination with natural coefficients of the basis elements is a necessary condition to be able to define discrete stability .",
    "we give characterisation of @xmath42 elements in these semigroups and establish discrete analogue of their lepage representation .",
    "the presentation of the theoretical material is complemented by examples from random measures , point processes and discrete semigroups all over the text . in particular , in section  [ sec",
