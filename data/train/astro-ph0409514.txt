    "the usual way to proceed with design studies for a future project , at least in a field of vhe gamma - ray astronomy , is to perform full scale simulations of detector response for various anticipated event types .",
    "apparently , gamma - ray - induced atmospheric showers represent a sample of signal events , whereas cosmic - ray showers form a dominating background ( for review of erenkov imaging technique see @xcite ) . for a future low - threshold instrument",
    "a correct tuning of detector design to optimize its response to gamma - ray events becomes a most important issue , due to the fact that the sensitivity of such a detector will be given by _",
    "angular and energy resolution for signal events_. both of these will finally determine an efficiency of background rejection . here",
    "we have studied how a single parameter of detector design , particularly the height of the observational site , may affect a topology of signal events .",
    "therefore , we have calculated the response of a ground - based erenkov light telescope of 30  m diameter , assuming an ideal focal - plane detector . comparative analysis of simulated events helped us to understand what are the major differences in parametrization of the erenkov light flashes from gamma - ray induced air showers , registered at two observational levels , i.e. 2 and 5 km above sea level .",
    "considering the analysis results , there is a discussion at the end of this paper as to which observational level might be considered as more favorable for effective shower imaging .",
    "numerous comparisons of a few shower simulation codes have been recently performed by different groups .",
    "they have revealed a rather good level of agreement in basic parameters of erenkov light emission in gamma - ray - induced air showers over broad energy range , starting from 100  gev and expanding up to 20  tev .",
    "calculations presented here have been carried out using one of those simulation codes , namely altai code @xcite .",
    "this numerical code was extensively used for production of the simulated data for the hegra system of five imaging atmospheric erenkov telescopes at la palma @xcite .",
    "shower simulations have been done for the standard continental atmosphere ( us standard atmosphere ) @xcite for the wavelength range of erenkov light photons from 300 to 600  nm .",
    "absorption of erenkov light photon in the atmosphere due to rayleigh and mie scattering was modelled according to the data given in @xcite .",
    "the detector simulation procedure used here accounted for all efficiencies involved in the process of the erenkov light propagation and registration @xcite .",
    "it includes ( i ) mirror reflectivity ; ( ii ) the acceptance of the funnels placed in front of the photomultipliers ( pmts ) ( iii ) the photon - to - photoelectron conversion inside the pmts ( bi - alkali photocathode ) .",
    "shower simulations were made here in the so - called `` batch '' mode .",
    "a shower propagating time , corresponding atmospheric depth , and a number of emitted erenkov photons were saved for each multiple - scattering segment of all electron trajectories in a shower .",
    "the actual segment size was chosen as small as 0.1  [ @xmath0 .",
    "cpu time needed for simulation of such low energy gamma - ray shower ( @xmath1=10  gev ) , using customary computers , is short , and it is not an issue for any scheme s optimization .",
    "one record for a single multiple - scattering segment was treated as an individual `` batch '' of emitted erenkov photons . at the second step of this simulation procedure",
    "all recorded batches were restored and finally used in the calculation of the response of a number of erenkov telescopes , situated at different atmospheric altitudes .",
    "such an approach provides an opportunity to use exactly the same simulated showers for various telescope arrangements at different observational levels .",
    "it should be noted that the estimated statistical error for the parameters of the erenkov light emission given below is @xmath2% .    for the next generation of ground",
    "based erenkov telescopes a dish of roughly 30 m diameter is foreseen .",
    "issues around the design of such a big reflector are addressed in @xcite . the simulation setup here consisted of 12 such telescopes , which were arranged along one line at distances from 0 to 300 m from the shower axis .",
    "note that the same showers were used in calculations for each of these telescopes .",
    "it allows for a direct comparison of the telescope s responses at different distances from the shower axis , and the accurate study of fluctuations in erenkov light flashes at different shower impacts .",
    "distribution of erenkov light emission from atmospheric showers can be characterized using a smooth function @xmath3 which gives a mean number of photons per unit area arriving at the observational level at time _",
    "t _ , with space , @xmath4 , and angular , @xmath5 , coordinates , calculated with respect to the shower axis . the presentation ( [ aaa ] ) presumes averaging over a number of photons at any local spot , because monte carlo simulations have provided the list of individual photons with their coordinates . in the ideal case",
    "a space - angular distribution of erenkov photons in the observational plane is simply a sum of @xmath6-functions constructed for each individual photon .",
    "the lateral distribution of erenkov photons at the observational level , which is supposed to be perpendicular to the shower axis , is given by @xmath7 the function @xmath8 is the density of erenkov light ( the number photons hitting the unit square at @xmath9 ) .    in a similar way one can derive a temporal distribution of a erenkov light pulse , and a two - dimensional angular distribution ( image ) of a erenkov light flash @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the area of the reflector and the angular camera size , respectively , of the telescope placed at @xmath14 .",
    "the function @xmath15 can be well described by a set of functions @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , given for a number of telescope locations , @xmath19 .",
    "it was emphasized in @xcite , that a substantial increase in erenkov light density at high altitudes in the atmosphere might be very promising for a further reduction of the effective energy threshold of a telescope array , which can be erected at a height of about 5  km above the sea .",
    "one can see in figure  [ fig:1 ] that for a 10  gev gamma - ray - induced atmospheric shower the density of erenkov light at 5  km above sea level , in a range of distances of the telescope to the shower core limited by @xmath20 , is about a factor of 2.5 higher than the corresponding density at 2  km altitude . at the same time _ in a range of relatively large impact distances , @xmath21  m , the erenkov light density remains the same at both observational heights . _",
    "( see figure  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum can be estimated as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the radiation length in air ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath1 is the primary energy of air - shower , and @xmath25 is the so - called critical energy ( @xmath26  mev ) .",
    "thus for a 10  gev @xmath27-ray - induced air - shower the atmospheric depth of its shower maximum is about 180  @xmath28 .",
    "a substantial fraction of erenkov light photons emitted from the shower maximum will be absorbed while traveling down to the observational level .",
    "between 30% and 16% ( in the wavelength range of 300 - 600 nm ) for the heights of 2.2 and 5  km above sea level , respectively .",
    "at the same time the erenkov light pool shrinks significantly at higher altitudes .",
    "the approximate radial size of the light pool at 2.2  km is about 130  m ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] ) , whereas at 5  km it might be roughly limited by @xmath29  m. it results in a corresponding increase of erenkov light density by approximately a factor of 2 .",
    "this geometrical effect has a major contribution on the increase of erenkov light density at high altitude as shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",

    "\\rho~ \\rm [ photon / m^2]$ ] .",
    "[ fig:1],height=264 ]    for a large telescope of a 30  m diameter , a requirement of a minimum number of 15  ph.-.e . in the erenkov light flash , which is sufficient to trigger the telescope , will limit the allowed range of impact distances for 10  gev gamma - ray showers to roughly @xmath33 ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "it corresponds to the same effective detection area of @xmath34 at both observational heights . on the other side , assuming that the erenkov light density scales with primary shower energy as @xmath35 , one can roughly estimate the minimal primary energy of the gamma - ray shower , which has still sufficient amount of light at the density profile plateau ( r@xmath36125  m ) and can still trigger the telescope .",
    "simple calculations yield , accordingly , a factor of 4 and 10 for 2 and 5  km altitudes , respectively .",
    "it means that one can catch gamma - ray events of energy @xmath37  gev and @xmath38  gev at 2 and 5  km observational height , respectively , using the same telescope .",
    "it is important to mention that all these extremely low - energy events will be concentrated within a radius of roughly 100  m , which is determined by the actual shape profile of a lateral distribution function of erenkov light .",
    "the drastic drop in photon density beyond 120  m will prevent the detection of such gamma - ray showers at larger distances to the shower axis . as a result the detection area for these events will be a weak function of primary shower energy .",
    "furthermore , the detection area of high energy gamma - ray showers will be of the same size at both observational heights .",

    "for a gamma - ray shower of a certain primary energy , e.g. of 10  gev , recorded at fixed observational level ( e.g. 2 or 5  km above sea level ) , the shape of the erenkov light flash basically depends only on the actual distance of the telescope to the shower axis .",
    "the arrival time of erenkov photons onto reflector is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is accordingly a propagation time of emitting electrons and photons , respectively .",
    "electrons of an energy , which is sufficient for emission of erenkov light in the atmosphere , are apparently moving faster than the emitted photons .",
    "thus at relatively small distances of the telescope to the shower axis ( @xmath55120  m ) erenkov photons , emitted at later stages of the shower development in the atmosphere , are actually arriving earlier than the photons emitted at the beginning of shower development .",
    "it swaps over at a large distance from the shower axis , because of the rather long travel path in dense atmosphere for the photons emitted by electrons out of a dying particle cascade .",
    "therefore , in general , the larger the distance of the telescope to the shower axis , the broader the corresponding erenkov light pulse",
    ".    time pulses of erenkov light flashes always show a very steep rising edge , and a slow fall - off .",

    "results of calculations are shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "one can see that for a 500  @xmath68 $ ] observational level time pulses are substantially broader at impact distances beyond 100  m. hereafter we are dealing with erenkov light images averaged over a sample of simulated 10  gev gamma - ray showers . for an impact distance of ca .",
    "250  m , the time pulse of erenkov light flash recorded at high altitude in the atmosphere will be a factor of 2 broader than for the same impact distance at a conventional altitude of 2  km above sea level ( see figure  [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "integration over the time pulse yields a total number of erenkov photons in a flash .",
    "therefore , for a given flux of night sky background light , _ a signal - to - background ratio might be correspondingly lower by factor of 2 for a high altitude site_. for high energy gamma - ray showers ( @xmath69100  gev ) erenkov pulses recorded at 5  km above sea level might be as long as 50  ns .",
    "registration of these pulses will occur in the regime highly dominated by night sky background .",
    "it is worth noting that , at the time of writing , there is no well established altitude dependence of a flux of night sky background light available . in general",
    "this parameter is considered to be very specific for each individual observational site .",
    "apparently the high altitude sites provide substantially reduced attenuation and consequently more starlight from the individual stars , which is in fact a background for the erenkov telescopes .",
    "however , the effect of bright stars might be diminished simply by switching off the high voltage for those camera pixels ( pmts ) collecting direct star light .",
    "such procedure usually runs in automatic mode while taking the observational runs . at the same time",
    "one might expect a significant increase in flux of background light photons within the uv wavelength range ( 200 - 300  nm ) .",
    "however , conventional imaging cameras are not very sensitive in a wavelength range well below 300  nm .",
    "even though there are good reasons to believe that this flux will , in fact , be much lower ( on average ) for high altitude sites , it still needs to be measured at any chosen observational site .",
    "for the sake of thoroughness one should mention that the high altitude sites will noticeable increase the probability that the ionizing particles , such as atmospheric electrons and muons of low energy cosmic rays , can directly hit the camera pmts .",
    "it will lead to some random increase in background light over the camera pixels .",
    "however , dedicated calculations are needed in order to quantify this additional component of the background , which fall unfortunately out of the area of this paper .      a two - dimensional distribution of the erenkov light intensity in the telescope s focal plane ( image ) , @xmath18 ,",
    "can be effectively used to derive detailed information about shower orientation and shape .",
    "phenomenology of erenkov light images was discussed in @xcite . for an ellipsoid - like image",
    ", the orientation of its major axis constrains the shower orientation in space with respect to the telescope optical axis .",
    "images recorded at relatively small impact distances from the shower axis ( r@xmath70100  m ) have circular shape , and an accurate determination of the major axis is quite difficult . for impact distances beyond 100  m the image ellipsoid",
    "has a well defined shape , and the ratio of its angular size measured along a major axis to the corresponding angular size of the image measured along a minor axis is ca . 2 and above .",
    "at the same time at large impact distances ( r@xmath71200  m ) the total number of erenkov photons in an image becomes rather low and high fluctuations prevent accurate measurement of the image orientation .",
    "those two effects finally constrain the range of optimum impact distances for effective shower reconstruction .",
    "as mentioned above , the advantage of the high altitude site is mainly associated with an enhancement in erenkov light density at small distances to the shower axis ( r@xmath72100  m ) . however , in this range of impact distances erenkov light images tend to have poorly determined orientation .",
    "average erenkov light images for two observational heights of 2 and 5  km , respectively , are shown in figure  [ fig:4 ] .",
    "note that scales used along x- and y - axis are not identical .",
    "detailed comparison of those images revealed two major differences in their shape .    .",

    "images of 10  gev gamma - ray showers recorded at high altitude above sea level are substantially larger in size ( see figure  [ fig:4 ] and table  [ tab:2 ] ) .",
    "this is mainly because showers are located at a relatively smaller distance to the telescope , than for a conventional observational site of 2  km above the sea .",
    "calculations show that the angular size of an image measured along the major axis , the image length , increases considerably faster with altitude than the angular size of image measured along a minor axis , the image width .",
    "this can be easily understood by comparing the ratio of the actual scale of a shower longitudinal development over the distance of shower maximum to the telescope , which is located at two altitudes of 2 and 5  km above the sea , respectively . in a simplified toy model",
    "the length of the image will scale with height of observation level above sea level , @xmath73 , as @xmath74 2 .",
    "images recorded at high altitude must have considerably larger displacement from the center of the focal plane .",
    "coming closer to the shower maximum ( @xmath75 is the height of the shower maximum ) , the shower will be apparently seen in erenkov light at larger angle @xmath76 with respect to the optical axis .",

    "thus , at large impact distances , the difference in image shape mentioned above is of purely geometrical origin , which is independent of the image size ( the total number of photons in the image ) . at first glance",
    ", large images at high altitudes might offer better resolution for a camera of crude pixellation .",
    "however , for a 10  gev gamma - ray shower images will always be significantly affected by contamination of background light and reduction of background light per camera pixel .",
    "large images recorded at high altitudes yield considerably lower erenkov light density per 1  @xmath77 for fixed image s size .",
    "_ for the flux of night sky photons , as measured at conventional observational level of 2  km above the sea , the image of a 10  gev gamma - ray shower recorded at high altitudes will have higher contamination of background photons per camera pixel of any size_.    as mentioned above , the images recorded at high altitudes must have large displacements from the camera center .",
    "this issue stringently constrains the design of the camera for the telescope placed at high altitudes , in particularly the field of view has to be larger .",

    "this may be tuned exactly , for example , to a rising edge , maximum , or tail of a time pulse .",
    "however , it leads to a trade off between losing a substantial fraction of erenkov photons and on the other hand a severe reduction of night sky background .",
    "this approach is illustrated by the images shown in figure  [ fig:5 ] .",
    "photons emitted at the very beginning of the shower development in the atmosphere , which are mainly arriving at the front of the time pulse of a flash , form the so - called image `` conk '' . the image of shower electrons , which propagate further into the atmosphere , shifts further away from the center of telescope s focal plane .",
    "multiple scattering of low energy cascade electrons at later stages of the shower development becomes very important and it results in a very broad image as shown in figure  [ fig:5 ] .",
    "one can see also in figure  [ fig:5 ] that erenkov light _",
    "images for such narrow time windows are in fact rather symmetric in shape , and they are not so good for reconstruction of image orientation_. at the same time , an image which contains all registered erenkov photons ( @xmath78 ) , has a regular ellipsoid - like shape .",
    "note that photons , which are significantly delayed with respect to the front of time pulse , will be hitting the outer edge of the image , whereas background light photons are apparently dominant .",
    "time - dependent imaging seems to be a rather promising approach in improvement of gamma / hadron separation of extremely low energy events . despite that",
    "_ present analysis does not reveal an evident improvement using time - dependent imaging _ , it could be perhaps very effective in analysis based on centroid positions in a few triggered telescopes in an array .",
    "in this paper we have attempted to perform a comparative analysis of erenkov light images simulated for two observational levels of 2 and 5  km above sea level , respectively .",
    "we used as the basis of our calculations a 30  m diameter telescope , which is a conceivable size for a future erenkov telescope project .",
    "the system aspect was not discussed here , but all conclusions are obviously relevant to any telescope of a possible future array .",
    "one has to mention that for a future detector , approaching a very low energy threshold of about 10  gev or even below , a contamination of night sky background in the registered shower images is in fact a very important issue .",
    "it might finally constrain the choice of the observational site for such low threshold arrays of erenkov telescopes .    results",
    "reported here generally confirm that the observational site at higher altitude provides substantially higher erenkov light density .",
    "however this enhancement occurs only within the area limited by roughly 100  m from shower axis .",
    "therefore all recorded gamma - ray showers well below 10  gev ( here we assume that the telescope has in fact sufficient area of the reflector , see discussion in section  [ ss:1 ] ) will concentrate in a region of relatively small impact distances .",
    "those images are not so clearly elongated in shape , which makes reconstruction of the image s orientation rather difficult",
    ".    flashes of erenkov light from 10  gev gamma - ray showers have broader time pulses for the impacts beyond 100  m at higher altitude .",
    "corresponding images are considerably broader as well . both of these two effects might apparently substantially increase the background light contamination in an image .",
    "images recorded at high altitude must be further displaced from the center of telescope s focal plane , than for conventional altitude of ca .",
    "2  km above sea level .",
    "they also , most probably , require larger field of view .",
    "the time - depending imaging is a very promising approach in further development of advanced analysis for observation of low energy gamma - ray showers , but it might be not very effective in resolving the problem of dominating night sky background light in the recorded images of such low energy gamma - rays .    one can briefly conclude that an observational site at high altitude might provide _ further modest reduction of the energy threshold _ of a future detector , even though the shape of time pulses and in particular the topology of the two - dimensional angular distribution of erenkov light flashes recorded at extremely high altitudes are palpably _ less preferable _ for imaging of gamma - ray showers above 10  gev .",
    "we hope that the results presented here may help to increase the understanding of changes in topology of erenkov light images after an increase in the observational level from its conventional height of ca . 2  km up to 5  km above sea level .",
    "ultimately , the choice of a site for the next generation of ground - based imaging atmospheric erenkov detector , which is widely believed to be a system of 30  m class telescopes , will depend on both scientific and political issues relating to funding , international collaboration etc .",
    "the move to lower energy threshold is likely to remain a significant drive for the science .",
    "however , one has to consider all trade - offs , i.e. reasonable altitude , low level of night sky background , need for the robotic telescopes etc , in selecting candidate sites for such a detector to optimize the scientific goals .",
