    "the spatial @xmath0-fleming - viot process was introduced in @xcite and @xcite as a new framework for studying the genetic evolution of a population distributed over a continuous space . in these papers ,",
    "two - dimensional spaces such as @xmath2 or the 2-dimensional torus were chosen since this seems natural for modeling the habitats of biological populations .",
    "the model , however , allows to consider any domain @xmath3 as a geographical space , and any compact metric space @xmath4 of types ( or ` alleles ' ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for some of the first studies of this process and its relations to other models .",
    "one noteworthy difference with previous models of structured populations is the following : while in the latter the reproduction mechanism can be phrased in terms of clocks carried by the individuals and deciding of reproduction and death times , in the spatial @xmath0-fleming - viot process it is driven by a poisson point process of extinction / recolonization events ( of various _ ranges _ @xmath5 and _ impacts _ @xmath6 $ ] ) . for brevity",
    ", we shall address such a configuration of events as an _ environment_. once an environment @xmath7 has been fixed , local populations change only at the times @xmath8 of an event , and only within the corresponding ball @xmath9 . during such an event ,",
    "a parent is chosen uniformly at random within @xmath10 and a fraction @xmath11 of the local population there is replaced by offspring of that individual in such a way that the total mass of the ( continuum ) population in this region remains constant .",
    "these offspring inherit the allele of their parent , which implies a jump in the local allele frequency at that time .",
    "as we shall see , the poisson point process formulation also enables us to model the ancestral process of a sample of individuals , which , thanks to an inherent assumption of neutrality , is a process _ independent of types _ : backwards - in - time , all ancestral lineages which are in the geographical area of an event are chosen to be ( or not to be ) affected by the event in an i.i.d .",
    "manner , that is by tossing a coin with success probability @xmath12 .",
    "the affected lineages then coalesce into a single ancestor whose position is uniformly distributed over the area of the event , and the ancestral process starts again from this new configuration .",
    "we shall assume that the random environment is a poisson process with a possibly infinite intensity .    in a non - spatial situation ( i.e. with @xmath13 consisting of a single element only ) , the random environment reduces to a poisson process of so - called @xmath12-_mergers _ , with intensity measure @xmath14 . in @xcite ,",
    "the resulting forward evolution of type frequencies was analysed as a measure - valued process and called @xmath0-fleming - viot process .",
    "the spatial @xmath0-fleming - viot process ( slfv , in short ) was formally constructed in @xcite using a method of evans @xcite .",
    "this more analytic approach , which we re - describe in section  [ subs : previous def ] , relies on a characterization of the semigroup of the slfv through a family of duality relations with the genealogical process mentioned above .",
    "our first motivation for this work is to relate the _ forwards _ and _ backwards _ evolutions in a more detailed manner , by first defining a reproduction model conditioned on the environment and then by attributing the types thanks to an explicit use of the genealogical relations between the individuals of the population .",
    "this construction , which leads to theorem  1 , provides a more probabilistic approach to the definition of the process and enables us to include a mutation mechanism ( which was not incorporated in the analytic construction and in fact seems less tractable there ) . in order to further disentangle the different sources of randomness",
    "acting on our population , in section  [ genealogy ] we extend the environment @xmath15 by adding a fifth coordinate recording the spatial location of the parent during each event .",
    "this allows to define a _ parental skeleton _ , out of which emerge all the genealogical trees relating a sample of individuals . in section  [ flow ] , we randomly label the individuals sitting at each site by numbers from @xmath16 $ ] , and extend the environment by a sixth coordinate that records the label of the parent during each reproduction event ( in the spirit of bertoin and le gall s flows of bridges , see @xcite ) . we show that in the absence of mutation , conditionally on this extended environment the slfv can be seen as a deterministic flow on the field of local allele frequencies which at any time conserves the geographical density of the population ( here assumed to be constant over space ) , and transports types through an accumulation of local reproduction events .",
    "mutations may distort this flow by acting independently on each ancestral line between the reproduction events .",
    "our second motivation consists in clarifying the state - space of the slfv and its topological properties .",
    "this is done in lemma  [ lem : topo ] . under the basic integrability assumption of @xcite ( see condition below ) we obtain some general properties about the process : lemma  [ lem : fv ] shows that the _ quenched _",
    "( i.e. , for a fixed environment ) slfv without mutation has cdlg paths of finite variation with probability @xmath17 ; proposition  [ prop : cdi ] tells us that , when the fraction of individuals replaced during an event is always less than @xmath17 , the genealogical process of a countable sample of individuals never _ comes down from infinity _ ( see section  [ section : cdi ] for a definition of this property ) .",
    "thirdly , we propose a representation of the slfv as the empirical distribution of the paths of an infinite collection of individuals .",
    "this is done in section  [ section : look - down ] through a look - down construction , which enables us to approximate the _ quenched _ spatial @xmath0-fleming - viot process by the empirical distribution of a large but finite set of individuals , uniformly over compact time intervals .",
    "the proof of our theorem  2 is inspired by that of theorem  1.1 in @xcite , which considers non - spatial @xmath0-fleming - viot processes . with the additional spatial structure",
    ", the fact that reproduction events happen only locally brings in new technical subtleties .    since their introduction by donnelly and",
    "kurtz in @xcite and @xcite , look - down constructions have proved useful in different contexts .",
    "for example , in @xcite it is used to show that the genealogy of an @xmath18-stable branching process ( with @xmath19 ) can be described as a randomly time - changed @xmath20-coalescent . in @xcite , it is at the core of the study of the evolving coalescent encoding the genealogy of the whole population in a wright - fisher model .",
    "finally , in @xcite it is used to show that a given class of @xmath0-fleming - viot processes ( ` coming down from infinity ' sufficiently fast ) with brownian mutation have a compact support at any positive time .",
    "such a construction was established for the non - spatial @xmath0-fleming - viot processes in @xcite . in @xcite , a look - down construction for continuum - sites stepping - stone models",
    "was carried out , in which the genealogy consists in feller processes which coalesce instantly upon meeting . because the corresponding genealogies are fairly different , so are the details of their proof .",
    "furthermore , they only show the convergence of the finite - dimensional distributions of their look - down process , whereas we prove its convergence in the space of cdlg paths . to our knowledge , there are no other constructions in the flavour of @xcite in which the spatial structure of the population influences their reproduction .",
    "note however that etheridge and kurtz @xcite propose a look - down construction of the slfv in the spirit of @xcite , and use it in particular to show that the finite - density population model introduced in @xcite converges towards the _ annealed _ slfv as the density of individuals tends to infinity .    in a more applied point of view",
    ", the different constructions carried out in sections  [ section : exist ] and [ section : look - down ] allow us to interpret a ` real ' population with reasonably large density as a poissonization of the measures describing the state of the theoretical ` infinite ' population .",
    "that is , at any time @xmath1 we can think of our ` real ' population as being the result of the evolution of the individuals with level less than some quantity @xmath21 in the look - down construction ( with @xmath21 not too small ) between times @xmath22 and @xmath1 , which form a locally finite poissonian cloud of trajectories in @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , the definition of the slfv in a _ fixed _",
    "environment may serve in reconstructing the main features of the history of a population .",
    "indeed , the genetic diversity observed at a given locus within a sample of individuals gives us some information about quantities such as the local rate of coalescence , which depend essentially on the _ annealed _ evolution .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more on inference issues related to the slfv . however , if we now consider a second locus in the genome , or even a fraction of this genome ( data which are now accessible through modern sequencing tools ) , the genetic diversities observed at all these sites are correlated first and foremost by the fact that they all flow through the same environment @xmath15 .",
    "hence , any information on @xmath15 brought by the analysis of the diversity at one locus yields some constraints on the genetic diversity at other loci . a good understanding of the _ quenched _ slfv is thus necessary to get a handle on the correlations between different parts of the genome and to devise statistical methods based on the available data to detect the presence of atypically big events acting as major catastrophes , or of natural selection acting on a given gene , or of any other kind of deviations from the hypothesis of neutral evolution made in this work .",
    "the paper is laid out as follows . in section  [ section :",
    "introductory ] , we describe the `` kernel - valued '' version of the spatial @xmath0-fleming - viot process introduced in @xcite and state our main result , namely the existence and uniqueness of the _ quenched _ slfv with mutation taking values in the space of radon measures on @xmath23 .",
    "we also present the two extensions of the environment discussed above .",
    "theorem  1 is proved in section  [ section : exist ] by constructing the two - parameter semigroup of transition probabilities conditionally on the configuration @xmath15 of events , for almost every @xmath15 . while this construction focusses on fixed times @xmath24 , in section  [ section : look - down ] we materialize the dynamics of the evolution by a look - down construction directly defined for all times .",
    "though these two steps could in fact be summed up into a single one , we chose to keep them separated to put forward the role of the poisson structure and of the exchangeability of the population in the construction of the slfv , and because the addition of levels is somehow an elaboration on the ideas used in the first construction . in section  [ section : cdi ]",
    ", we use the same kind of arguments as in the previous sections to address the question of _ coming down from infinity _ for the genealogical process .",
    "let us start by describing the first construction of the slfv , carried out in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as the geographical space in which the population evolves we fix a domain @xmath3 , and we write @xmath4 for the compact space of all possible types . for a locally compact metric space ( with @xmath25 or @xmath26 as the generic examples ) , let @xmath27 ( resp .",
    ", @xmath28 ) denote the set of all nonnegative radon ( resp . , probability ) measures on @xmath29 , and let @xmath30 be the quotient of the space of all lebesgue - measurable maps ( or _ probability kernels _ ) @xmath31 by the equivalence relation @xmath32 in other words , two maps @xmath33 and @xmath34 are in the same equivalence class iff the measures @xmath35 and @xmath36 on @xmath23 are equal",
    ". we shall give a mathematically equivalent description of @xmath30 at the beginning of the next subsection .",
    "to specify the dynamics , let @xmath37 be a @xmath38-finite measure on @xmath39 and @xmath40 be a collection of probability measures on @xmath16 $ ] such that the map @xmath41 is measurable with respect to @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath42 be a poisson point process on @xmath43 $ ] with intensity measure @xmath44 .",
    "the random point configuration @xmath42 acts as a _ random environment _ in which the population evolves : if @xmath45 , then at time @xmath1 a _ reproduction event _ occurs within the closed ball @xmath46 , that is    * a location @xmath47 is sampled uniformly at random in @xmath48 and a type @xmath49 is chosen according to @xmath50 ( equivalently , a type is sampled according to the mean type distribution in @xmath48 just before the event ) , * for every @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "the value of @xmath33 outside the ball remains unchanged , that is @xmath53 for every @xmath54 .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of a markov process evolving according to this dynamics is proven in section  4 of @xcite under the condition @xmath55 ( in fact this is shown there only for @xmath56 , but the proof is identical in all dimensions and for any domain in @xmath57 . )",
    "the process is characterized by a family of duality relations , based on the following very simple idea . in the absence of mutation ,",
    "the type of the parent is transmitted to all its offspring .",
    "thus , to know the types of a few individuals sampled at time @xmath1 , it suffices to go back to their ancestors at some reference time ( say , @xmath22 ) in the past , and to check which types they carried .",
    "now , some of the individuals alive at time @xmath1 may share a common ancestor at time @xmath22 , which introduces some correlations between their types . as a consequence ,",
    "the natural dual process to consider is that tracing the ancestral relations between a sample of individuals , from time @xmath1 on and back into the past .",
    "let us thus imagine what the ancestral process of a sample of individuals should look like under the prescribed evolution .",
    "here we forget about types , and for any @xmath58 , we represent the genealogical relations of a sample of @xmath49 individuals ( labelled by @xmath59 ) by a process @xmath60 with values in the set of all partitions of @xmath61 whose blocks are marked by an element of @xmath62 . in words , @xmath63 corresponds to the time at which our individuals are sampled and for any @xmath64 , each block of @xmath65 contains the labels of all of these individuals who share a common ancestor @xmath66 units of time back in the past .",
    "the mark of a block records the spatial location of the corresponding ancestor at that time .",
    "when convenient , we shall write @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the mark of the block @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the number of distinct ancestors at time @xmath66 in the past .",
    "see figure [ ancestries ] ( with @xmath71 ) , where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 .    as a start , suppose that we sample a single individual and trace back where its ancestors were . since forwards - in - time the population evolves only at the epochs of events of @xmath42 , so does the spatial location of an ancestral lineage .",
    "going back by a sufficient amount of time , one will encounter the first event @xmath75 in the past in which our individual was not only in the area @xmath76 hit at that time , but was also part of the fraction @xmath77 of the local population replaced by offspring of the elected parent .",
    "( below we shall argue that condition guarantees that the time it takes back to this first event in the past is a.s . strictly positive . ) hence , at the time @xmath78 of this event , the ancestral line of our individual jumps to the location of its parent , which is by construction uniformly distributed over @xmath76 . using the same reasoning , we can then find an earlier event @xmath79 during which this parent was born .",
    "the ancestral lineage at that time jumps to a location uniformly distributed over @xmath80 and stays there until the time of the event in its past during which it was born , and so on .",
    "now , observe that the sequence of events experienced by the ancestral lineage backwards - in - time is governed by the law of @xmath42 .",
    "consequently , the rate at which the lineage jumps can be computed directly in terms of @xmath37 and @xmath81 : once the radius @xmath82 and the impact @xmath12 of the event have been chosen , the volume of centres such that the current location @xmath68 of a lineage belongs to the range of the event is @xmath83 and the probability that the lineage belongs to the set of newborns is @xmath12 .",
    "hence , the time to wait before the next jump is exponentially distributed with parameter @xmath84 and at that time @xmath85 jumps to a new location uniformly distributed over the area of the corresponding event . under the condition stated in ( [ cond def ] ) , this jump rate is bounded by a constant independent of the current location of the lineage .",
    "now think of several individuals sampled at distinct locations .",
    "when a past event comes up that covers at least one of them , each of the lineages within its range has a probability @xmath12 of being an offspring of the parent chosen , independently of the others .",
    "then , all the lineages which were born in this event trace back to the same parent and therefore merge at that time into a single ancestor ( i.e. , the corresponding blocks of @xmath65 merge into a single block ) whose location is uniformly distributed over the area of the event .",
    "the other lineages , outside the ball or inside but not within the pool of offspring , remain unaffected . because nothing happens between the events in @xmath42 that affect the genealogy , the description of @xmath86 as a markovian system of coalescing blocks whose",
    "marks evolve like a family of correlated jump processes is complete .",
    "there remains to find an appropriate set of test functions .",
    "to this end , let @xmath87 ( resp .",
    ", @xmath88 ) stand for the set of all continuous ( resp .",
    "continuous and compactly supported ) functions on the space @xmath29 .",
