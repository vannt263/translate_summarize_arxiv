    "this paper is a contribution to the study of linear dynamical systems on hilbert spaces . in other words , we are interested in the behavior of orbits of bounded linear operators defined on a hilbert space .",
    "the symbol @xmath1 will always designate a complex separable infinite - dimensional hilbert space , and we denote by @xmath2 the algebra of all bounded linear operators on @xmath1 .",
    "we refer to the books @xcite or @xcite for background on linear dynamics , and to the papers @xcite or @xcite for a glimpse at the richness of the class of linear dynamical systems and its potential usefulness in general ergodic theory .",
    "a quick review of a number of definitions will be given in the next subsection .",
    "let us just recall here that an operator @xmath3 is said to be _ hypercyclic _ if it admits at least one dense orbit ( and hence a dense @xmath4 set of such orbits ) .",
    "the class of all hypercyclic operators on @xmath1 will be denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "recall also that an operator @xmath3 is said to be _",
    "chaotic _ if it is hypercyclic and admits a dense set of periodic vectors , and _ frequently hypercyclic _",
    "@xmath6-_frequently hypercyclic _ ) if there exists at least one vector @xmath7 whose orbit visits frequently every non - empty open set @xmath8 , in the sense that the set of integers @xmath9 such that @xmath10 belongs to @xmath11 has positive lower ( resp .",
    "upper ) density .",
    "obviously , the dynamical properties of linear operators can be studied ( and have been studied extensively ) in a very general setting ",
    "arbitrary banach spaces , or even arbitrary topological vector spaces . however , there are good reasons for focusing on hilbert spaces .",
    "the first that may come to mind is perhaps that  this is the natural setting for doing operator theory \"  which is of course a highly questionable statement .",
    "less subjectively , the richness of the hilbert space structure allows for the construction of many interesting examples .",
    "also , in some parts of linear dynamics , especially all that concerns _ ergodic - theoretic _ properties of linear operators , the general picture is neater on hilbert spaces than on arbitrary banach spaces .",
    "finally , some natural questions in the area have been solved recently for operators on general banach space but _ not _ in the hilbertian case .",
    "this should not seem paradoxical , if one compares for example with the current state of affairs regarding the famous invariant subspace problem .",
    "the questions we are considering in this paper are quite basic . in very general terms , they are of the following type : given two interesting dynamical properties , do there exist linear operators on @xmath1 satisfying one of them but not the other ?    perhaps the most famous question of this type is herrero s  @xmath12 problem \" , stated in @xcite and asking whether there exist hypercyclic operators which are not _ topologically weakly mixing_. as should be expected since this is trivially true for dynamical systems on compact spaces , the answer is  yes \" : this was shown by de la rosa and read in @xcite , and then in @xcite for operators on @xmath13 spaces , in particular for hilbert space operators .",
    "however , the proof is surprisingly non - trivial . to give just one more example",
    ", the third named author was recently able to solve another well - known problem in the area by constructing in @xcite operators on @xmath13 spaces which are chaotic but not frequently hypercyclic  actually , not even @xmath6-frequently hypercyclic . in the present paper , we will be especially interested in the following questions :    * are there operators which are frequently hypercyclic but not _ ergodic _ , do not admit an ergodic measure with full support ?",
    "* are there operators which are @xmath0-frequently hypercyclic but not frequently hypercyclic ? * are there operators which are ergodic but do not admit a _ gaussian _",
    "ergodic measure with full support ?",
    "note that the answer to the first two questions is known to be  yes \" for operators on the banach space @xmath14 ( see @xcite and @xcite , as well as @xcite for further developments ) ; but the hilbertian case had not been settled . as for the third question , we are not aware of any previous answer , on any banach space .",
    "one can attack questions of this type from two complementary points of view ( of course , there are other strategies as well ) .",
    "*  collective \" point of view : among the properties one is interested in , one may try to determine which ones are _ generic _ and which ones are not , in a baire category sense .",
    "once this is done , one may be able to distinguish two properties because one of them is generic and the other one is not . *  individual \" point of view : when it is unclear how a baire category approach could work , one may still try to construct explicit examples of operators satisfying ( or not ) such or such a property .",
    "note that it is quite natural to present the two viewpoints in this order , because the indirect , baire category approach is in some sense simpler .",
    "indeed , it is usually not too difficult to guess when it should work , and in this case the technical details are likely to be rather soft . on the other hand",
    ", one may reasonably expect to face technical difficulties when attempting a direct construction ( and perhaps quite serious ones if baire category is unefficient ) .    to give meaning to the  collective \" viewpoint",
    ", one has to fix an appropriate topological setting .",
    "we will in fact consider _ two _ natural topologies on @xmath2 : the _ strong operator topology _ ( denoted by @xmath15 ) , and the _ strong@xmath16 operator topology _",
    "( denoted by @xmath17 ) . restricted to any closed ball @xmath18 ,",
    "these topologies are _ polish _ ( separable and completely metrizable ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath19 is easily seen to be @xmath15-@xmath4 in @xmath2 , so that for any @xmath20 , the family @xmath21 is itself a polish space in its own right with respect to both @xmath15 and @xmath17 .",
    "this opens the way to baire category arguments in @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "of course , there is nothing new in this observation : baire category methods have already proved as useful in operator theory as anywhere else ; see in particular @xcite .",
    "recall that a subset of a polish space @xmath24 is said to be _ meager _ in @xmath24 if it can be covered by countably many closed sets with empty interior , and _ comeager _ if its complement is meager ( equivalently , if it contains a dense @xmath4 subset of @xmath24 ) .",
    "following a well - established terminology , we will say that a property of elements of @xmath24 is _ typical _ if the set of all @xmath25 satisfying it is comeager in @xmath24 , and that a property is _ atypical _ if its negation is typical . in this paper",
    ", we obtain among other things the following results , for any @xmath20 .",
    "* an @xmath17-typical @xmath26 is ( topologically ) weakly mixing but not mixing . *",
    "an @xmath17-typical @xmath26 is densely distributionally chaotic .",
    "* an @xmath17-typical @xmath27 has no eigenvalues and admits no non - trivial invariant measure .",
    "in particular , chaoticity and @xmath0-frequent hypercyclicity are atypical properties of hypercyclic operators ( in the @xmath28 sense )",
    ".    admittedly , there results are not that surprising ( except , perhaps , the one concerning @xmath0-frequent hypercyclicity ) .",
    "still , they do sketch the landscape , and they explain in some sense why some results in the area turn out to be ( or are likely to be ) harder to prove than some others . for example , the fact that topological weak mixing is a typical property seems to prevent the use of  soft \" arguments for establishing the existence of hypercyclic operators which are not weakly mixing ; and indeed , the proofs in @xcite and @xcite rely on rather technical arguments .    on the other hand ,",
    "something more unexpected happens if one restricts oneself to the class of operators of the form @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a diagonal operator and @xmath31 is a weighted unilateral backward shift ( with respect to some fixed orthonormal basis of @xmath1 ) :    * in the @xmath15 sense , most  diagonal plus shift \" hypercyclic operators are ergodic and yet have only countably many unimodular eigenvalues .",
    "in particular , there exist operators on @xmath1 which are ergodic but admit no gaussian ergodic measure with full support .",
    "this solves a rather intriguing question , which seems to go back to flytzanis paper  @xcite and has been very much in the air in the last few years .",
    "as for the  individual \" viewpoint , we will elaborate on the kind of operators constructed by the third named author in @xcite .",
    "recall that the main result of @xcite is the existence of chaotic operators on @xmath32 spaces which are not @xmath6-frequently hypercyclic . in the present paper ,",
    "we describe a general scheme allowing to produce , among other things ,    * operators on @xmath33 which are chaotic and frequently hypercyclic but not ergodic ; * operators on @xmath1 which are chaotic and @xmath0-frequently hypercyclic but not frequently hypercyclic .",
    "these are the first examples of such kinds of operators living on a hilbert space , even if one dispenses with the chaoticity assumption : no examples of frequently hypercyclic non - ergodic operators , nor of @xmath6-frequently hypercyclic non frequently hypercyclic operators living on a hilbert space were known before .",
    "as already mentioned , up to now the only available examples were operators acting on @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , our constructions will also enable us to improve the main result of @xcite by showing that there exist    * operators on @xmath1 which are chaotic and _ topologically mixing _ but not @xmath0-frequently hypercyclic .",
    "one point is especially worth mentioning regarding these results : it is not at all accidental that all the operators we construct turn out to be chaotic . on the contrary ,",
    "our proofs rely heavily on new criteria for frequent hypercyclicity and @xmath0-frequent hypercyclicity ( stronger than the usual ones ) , in which the periodic points play a central role .    in this part of the paper ,",
    "our constructions and arguments are rather technical , and it is not at all clear that they could be by - passed by suitable baire category arguments .",
    "as already suggested above , there are reasons to believe that technicalities are unavoidable here : since @xmath0-frequent hypercyclicity , frequent hypercyclicity and ergodicity are atypical properties , it seems difficult to distinguish them using simply the baire category theorem ; unless one restricts oneself to some cleverly chosen special class of operators , which has yet to be found .",
    "the basic questions we address in this paper can also be considered from a third point of view , which is that of _ descriptive set theory_. indeed , once it is known ( by any argument ) that two properties of linear operators are not the same , _",
    "i.e. _ that two classes of operators are distinct , it is natural to wonder if a stronger conclusion might hold true , namely that these classes do not have the same _ complexity _ in the sense of descriptive set theory .",
    "more generally , it can be a quite interesting problem to determine the exact descriptive complexity of a given class of operators . in this paper , we do so for chaotic operators and for topologically mixing operators .",
    "we also obtain a partial result for @xmath0-frequently hypercyclic operators , whose proof relies on our general scheme for constructing operators with special properties .",
    "we finish this overview by pointing out that the difficulty of the existence results presented in this paper is specifically connected with the linear setting , and that the corresponding results are essentially trivial if one moves over to the broader setting of _ polish dynamical systems _",
    "( dynamical systems of the form @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a continuous self - map of a polish space @xmath24 ; see for instance the book @xcite , as well as @xcite for more on linear systems as special cases of polish systems ) . indeed , extending the definitions of frequent and @xmath6-frequent hypercyclicity to the polish setting in the obvious way , it is not difficult to see that frequently hypercyclic non - ergodic polish dynamical systems do exist , as well as @xmath6-frequently hypercyclic polish dynamical systems which are not frequently hypercyclic . here are two simple examples .",
    "first , consider an irrational rotation @xmath36 of the unit circle @xmath37 , and denote by @xmath38 the normalized lebesgue measure  on @xmath37 .",
    "then @xmath39 is an ergodic   dynamical system for which all points are frequently hypercyclic .",
    "let @xmath40 be a compact subset of @xmath37 which has empty interior and is such that @xmath41 , and consider the set @xmath42 .",
    "then @xmath24 is a dense @xmath43 subset of @xmath37 which is @xmath36-invariant , and @xmath44 is thus a frequently hypercyclic  polish dynamical system .",
    "but , as @xmath45 ( by ergodicity ) and @xmath36 is uniquely ergodic , @xmath44 admits no invariant  measure  at all .",
    "this shows in particular the existence of frequently hypercyclic polish dynamical systems which are not ergodic .",
    "this example is due to b. weiss ( private communication ) .    now , consider a frequently hypercyclic  operator @xmath35 on @xmath1 .",
    "then , the set @xmath46 of all @xmath6-frequently hypercyclic vectors for @xmath35 is comeager in @xmath1 ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) , whereas the set @xmath47 of frequently hypercyclic vectors for @xmath35 is meager ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "hence @xmath48 is comeager in @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath49 be a dense @xmath50 subset of @xmath1 contained in @xmath48 , and set @xmath51 .",
    "then @xmath24 is a dense @xmath50 subset of @xmath1 which is @xmath35-invariant , so that @xmath34 is a polish dynamical system .",
    "since @xmath24 is still contained in @xmath48 , all points of @xmath24 are @xmath6-frequently hypercyclic for @xmath35 but none of them is frequently hypercyclic .",
    "in particular , the polish dynamical system @xmath34 is @xmath6-frequently hypercyclic but not frequently hypercyclic .      in this subsection",
    ", we recall some well - known definitions , referring to @xcite or @xcite for more details .",
    "we also fix some notations that will be used throughout the paper .      if @xmath3 , we set , for any subsets @xmath52 of @xmath1 , @xmath53    it is well - known that @xmath35 is hypercyclic if and only if it is _ topologically transitive _",
    ", @xmath54 for all open sets @xmath55 .",
    "a stronger property is _ topological mixing _ : @xmath35 is topologically mixing if all sets @xmath56 are _ cofinite _ rather than just non - empty ; that is , for any pair @xmath57 of non - empty open sets in @xmath1 , one has @xmath58 for all but finitely many @xmath9 . in between transitivity and mixing is _ topological weak mixing _ : an operator @xmath3 is topologically weakly mixing if @xmath59 is hypercyclic on @xmath60 ; in other words , if @xmath61 for all non - empty open sets @xmath62 .",
    "we set @xmath63 so that @xmath64    it is easy to see ( for example by considering weighted backward shifts ) that the inclusion @xmath65 is proper .",
    "as already mentioned , the inclusion @xmath66 is also proper : this was first proved by de la rosa and read in @xcite for operators living on a suitably manufactured banach space , and then in @xcite for hilbert space operators .",
    "recall also that , according to a nice result of bs and peris @xcite , the topologically weakly mixing operators are exactly those satisfying the so - called _ hypercyclicity criterion_.      an operator @xmath3 is said to be _",
    "chaotic _ in the sense of devaney if it is hypercyclic and its periodic points are dense in @xmath1 ( in the linear setting , hypercyclicity automatically implies sensitive dependence on the initial conditions ) .",
    "we set @xmath67    it is not completely obvious , but nonetheless true , that chaotic operators are topologically weakly mixing ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) ) . in other words ,",
    "@xmath68      in this paper , the word  measure \" will always mean  borel probability measure \" .",
    "a measure @xmath69 on @xmath1 is _ invariant _ for some operator @xmath3 if @xmath70 ; and an invariant measure @xmath69 for @xmath35 is _ non - trivial _ if @xmath71 ( note that the point mass @xmath72 is invariant for any @xmath3 since @xmath73 ) .",
    "also , a measure @xmath69 on @xmath1 is said to have _ full support _ if @xmath74 for every non - empty open set @xmath75 .",
    "this means exactly that the topological support of @xmath69 is equal to the whole space @xmath1 .",
    "an operator @xmath3 is said to be _ ergodic _ if it admits an invariant measure @xmath69 with full support with respect to which it is ergodic , _",
    "i.e. _ such that for every borel subset @xmath31 of @xmath1 satisfying @xmath76 , we have @xmath77 or @xmath78 . if the measure @xmath69 can be taken to be gaussian , we say that @xmath35 is _ ergodic in the gaussian sense _ , or _",
    "@xmath49-ergodic_. the operator @xmath35 is said to be _ mixing _ if it admits an invariant measure @xmath69 with full support with respect to which it is strongly mixing , _ i.e. _ such that @xmath79 for any borel sets @xmath80 . mixing _ in the gaussian sense _ is defined as expected .",
    "the corresponding notations are the following : @xmath81 since the measures involved are required to have full support , it is obvious by definition that ergodic operators are hypercyclic and that mixing operators are topologically mixing .",
    "that is , @xmath82    these inclusions are proper : for example , if @xmath31 is any compact weighted backward shift on the hilbert space @xmath83 , the operator @xmath84 is topologically mixing ( see @xcite or @xcite ) but not ergodic : its spectrum is reduced to the point @xmath85 , so that it is by @xcite not even @xmath6-frequently hypercyclic .",
    "we also set @xmath86 thus , for example , any operator admitting a non - zero periodic point belongs to @xmath87 , and any chaotic operator lies in @xmath88 .",
    "so we have @xmath89 this inclusion can not be reversed : there exist even @xmath49-ergodic operators on @xmath1 which are not chaotic ( see @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.5 ) ) .    at this point",
    ", we would like to stress that in the present paper , we will mostly focus on invariant measures which are _ not required to be gaussian_. this is a true change of point of view compared with earlier works on the ergodic theory of linear dynamical systems ( see for instance , among other works , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite  ) , where gaussian measures play a central role .",
    "but in retrospect , this is in fact quite natural : as we shall see in section  [ uppertriang ] , it turns out that within a certain natural class of upper - triangular operators on @xmath1 , the ergodic operators which are not ergodic in the gaussian sense are typical .",
    "note also that non - gaussian measures already played an essential role in such works as @xcite , @xcite or @xcite for instance .",
    "let @xmath3 .",
    "for any @xmath90 and @xmath91 , set @xmath92 the operator @xmath35 is said to be _ frequently hypercyclic _ if there exists some @xmath90 such that , for any open set @xmath93 , the set @xmath94 has positive lower density ; and @xmath35 is _",
    "@xmath0-frequently hypercyclic _ if there is some @xmath7 such that all sets @xmath94 has positive upper density .",
    "frequent hypercyclicity was introduced in @xcite and rather extensively studied since then ( for instance in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite  ) .",
    "the study of upper - frequent hypercyclicity is more recent .",
    "this notion was introduced by shkarin in @xcite . until the last few years",
    ", it has perhaps been unfairly considered as somehow ",
    "less interesting \" , probably because of a lack of examples or results exhibiting truly different behaviors between frequently and @xmath6-frequently hypercyclic operators .",
    "however , despite a formal similarity in the definitions , there are some important differences between frequent and @xmath0-frequent hypercyclicity . for example",
    ", the set of frequently hypercyclic vectors for a frequently hypercyclic operator @xmath35 on @xmath1 is always _ meager _ in @xmath1 ( @xcite , @xcite ) whereas if @xmath35 is a @xmath6-frequently hypercyclic operator on @xmath1 , the set of all @xmath0-frequently hypercyclic vectors for @xmath35 is _ comeager _ in @xmath1 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for more along these lines ) .",
    "this may lead to believe that @xmath0-frequent hypercyclicity is a typical property while frequent hypercyclicity is not ; which is in fact a wrong intuition : as we shall see , both properties are atypical .",
    "yet , these properties are not equivalent : bayart and rusza exhibited in @xcite examples of @xmath6-frequently hypercyclic operators on @xmath95 which are not frequently hypercyclic . the notion of @xmath6-frequent hypercyclicity",
    "was further studied by bonilla and grosse - erdmann in @xcite , and it plays an important role in the present paper .",
    "one can go one step further and study _",
    "@xmath96-hypercyclic _ operators , for a given family @xmath96 of subsets of @xmath97 ( see in particular @xcite and @xcite ) ; but we will not follow this quite interesting route here . as for the notations , we set @xmath98    although the definitions of frequent hypercyclicity and @xmath0-frequent hypercyclicity make no explicit reference to measures , they have a partly  metrical \" flavour ; and indeed , invariant measures are quite relevant here .",
    "first , it follows easily from the pointwise ergodic theorem that ergodic operators are frequently hypercyclic .",
    "moreover , it is shown in @xcite that @xmath0-frequently hypercyclic operators on @xmath1 admit invariant measures with full support ( this is in fact true for operators living on any reflexive banach space ) .",
    "so we have @xmath99    the inclusion @xmath100 is proper : as already mentioned , it is proved in @xcite that there exist even chaotic operators on @xmath1 which are not @xmath0-frequently hypercyclic . as we shall see in section",
    "[ special ] ( theorems [ theorem 54 ] and [ theorem 58 ] ) , the other two inclusions are also proper .",
    "if @xmath3 , we denote by @xmath101 the set of all _ unimodular eigenvectors _ of @xmath35 , eigenvectors @xmath102 of @xmath35 whose associated eigenvalue @xmath103 has modulus @xmath78 .",

    "the notations are as follows : @xmath108 we also define @xmath109 properties of unimodular eigenvectors of an operator @xmath3 are closely related to those of invariant _ gaussian _ measures for @xmath35 ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) : indeed , it turns out that in fact @xmath110 so that there was in fact no need for introducing new notations .",
    "however , things are not that neat on arbitrary banach spaces : see @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "this is one of the advantages of working on hilbert spaces , or at least on  nice \" banach spaces .",
    "distributional chaos was first defined by schweitzer and smtal in @xcite , under the name _ strong chaos _ , for self - maps of a compact interval , and several definitions have been proposed afterwards in the context of general metric spaces .",
    "there is no need to recall these definitions here , because things simplify greatly in the linear setting : as shown in @xcite , an operator @xmath3 is distributionally chaotic if and only if it admits a _ distributionally irregular vector _ , a vector @xmath7 for which there exist two sets @xmath111 and @xmath31 of integers , both of upper density @xmath78 in @xmath97 , such that @xmath112 the corresponding notation is the following one : @xmath113    a related class is that of _ densely distributionally chaotic operators _ , of operators which admit a dense set of distributionally irregular vectors .",
    "we use the following notation for this set : @xmath114 obviously , @xmath115 .",

    "the last class of operators which we introduce is that of operators @xmath126 such that @xmath116 is maximal : @xmath127    since , as proved in @xcite , the set of all distributionally irregular vectors for a given operator @xmath128 is comeager in @xmath1 , it is clear that @xmath129 .",
    "moreover , it is shown in @xcite ( more accurately , half in @xcite and half in @xcite ) that ergodic operators are densely distributionally chaotic : @xmath130 .",
    "so we have @xmath131    it is left as an open question in @xcite to determine whether @xmath132 , or whether at least @xmath133 .",
    "it follows from the proof of the main result of @xcite that the first inclusion does not hold true : the chaotic operator @xmath35 constructed there belongs to @xmath134 ( as does any chaotic operator on @xmath1 ) but satisfies @xmath135 .",
    "however this operator is not frequently hypercyclic , and so the examples of @xcite do not disprove the second inclusion .",
    "we will nonetheless show in the present paper that this inclusion does not hold true either ( theorem [ theorem 54 ] ) .",

    "the second question runs as follows :    [ question b ] do there exist frequently hypercyclic operators on @xmath1 which are not ergodic ?",
    "this question comes from @xcite , where it is proved that frequently hypercyclic non - ergodic operators do exist on the space @xmath95 .",
    "the proof of this result again relies on a construction of @xcite : it is proved in @xcite that the frequently hypercyclic bilateral weighted shifts @xmath35 on @xmath1561 defined in @xcite satisfy @xmath1562 , and thus can not be ergodic . for some reasons , we found it rather tempting to try to attack this question by baire category methods ; but again , we did not succeed in this way .",

    "let us consider the class @xmath1262 of operators in @xmath1261 whose diagonal coefficients are rationally independent .",
