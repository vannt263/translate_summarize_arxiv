    "the characterisation of diffuse emission from the galaxy is important for the detailed study of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "knowledge of the spectral shape and spatial morphology is important for the accurate subtraction of the foreground emission .",
    "this in turn provides a more precise view of the cmb anisotropies thus providing the most reliable cosmological information .",
    "the frequency range of greatest interest for cmb observations is @xmath12  ghz , which is close to the minimum of foreground emission at @xmath13  ghz ( bennett et al .",
    "the diffuse galactic foregrounds include synchrotron , free - free and vibrational ( thermal ) dust emissions .",
    "however there is considerable evidence , from deep cmb data at high galactic latitudes , for an additional component that emits in the frequency range @xmath14  ghz ( kogut et al .",

    "the data show a strong correlation with fir ( @xmath15 m ) emission that suggests a connection to dust grains .",
    "the most popular candidate for this anomalous component is rapidly spinning small dust grains ( draine & lazarian 1998a , b ) , referred to as spinning dust .",
    "models of spinning dust emission predict a strongly peaked spectrum at @xmath16  ghz , which appears to be broadly consistent with the data . furthermore , targetted observations of galactic sources have shown excess emission in this frequency range ( finkbeiner et al .",

    "2 regions are dominated by free - free ( thermal bremsstrahlung ) emission from ionised gas with electron temperatures , @xmath18  k. the spectrum of free - free radiation is well - understood ; in the optically thin regime ( @xmath19ghz ) , it has a well - defined flux density spectral index , is defined as @xmath20 . ]",
    "@xmath21 that does not vary greatly with frequency or @xmath22 @xcite",
    ". however , emission from spinning dust could be inherent since ion collisions with grains are expected to be the largest contributory factor in maintaining large rotational velocities required to produce significant rotational dust emission ( draine & lazarian 1998b ) .",
    "indeed , several detections are associated with 2 regions ( watson et al .",
    "2005 ) or pne ( casassus et al .",
    "2004,2007 ) .",
    "one previous tentative detection of spinning dust from the 2 region lph96[201.663 + 1.643 ] , which appeared to show a rising spectrum from @xmath23  ghz , suggestive of spinning dust ( finkbeiner et al .",
    "2002 ; finkbeiner  2004 ) , was shown to be a spurious result with only little room for spinning dust ( dickinson et al .",
    "2006 ; scaife et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "in this paper we have imaged several southern 2 regions with the cosmic background imager ( cbi ) to look for excess emission at 31  ghz , which could be attributed to spinning dust .",
    "these are among the brightest 2 regions in the sky and are known to be dominated by free - free emission at radio frequencies up to @xmath24  ghz .",
    "furthermore , they contain copious amounts of dust within the same volume , as traced by correlated fir ( @xmath25 m ) emission .",
    "using data from the literature , we model the spectrum of free - free radiation and compare the cbi data to measure or place limits on possible excess emission at 31  ghz .",
    "we also use cbi polarisation data to measure and place upper limits on the polarisation of free - free emission .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     [ tab : emissivities ]      the cbi polarisation maps all showed some polarised emission for these sources , but at a very low level of 0.3 per cent , except for @xmath26 , which was at 0.6 per cent .",
    "this may be due to the fact that @xmath26 is located away from the map centre by almost half a primary beam width .",
    "this could contribute extra leakage and/or errors due to the primary beam correction .",
    "we therefore take these values to be upper limits to the polarisation on these angular scales .",
    "this is consistent with little or no polarisation , as expected for pure free - free emission .",
    "free - free emission is intrinsically unpolarised , but can be polarised at the edges of hii  regions by thomson scattering .",
    "the radiation is then tangentially polarised to the edges of the cloud , at a level that depends on the viewing angle relative to the incident radiation @xcite . at these angular resolutions",
    ", we did not expect to see this effect since the sources are barely resolved in the cbi beam thus any secondary scattering will be averaged out by the beam . spinning dust emission",
    "is expected to be weakly polarised at the few per cent level @xcite .",
    "however , we did expect some level of instrumental leakage , which converts stokes @xmath27 to stokes @xmath28 and @xmath29 , at the level of @xmath30  per cent based on earlier observations of w44 @xcite .",
    "we have not attempted to correct for leakage terms and hence it is not surprising to see such levels of polarisation .",
    "this naturally explains the remarkably similar polarisation fractions observed in the different hii  regions .",
    "we therefore consider the quoted polarisation fractions ( table  [ tab : polarisation ] ) to be upper limits .",
    "the level of the leakage shown here is encouraging since the recent cbi polarisation results @xcite had no corrections made for instrumental leakage .",
    "given the signal - to - noise ratio of the cmb polarisation detections , this level of leakage can be safely ignored , and we can be sure that the contamination is certainly below the 1 per cent level .    for the most significant detection of excess emission in @xmath7 ,",
    "the polarisation limit translates to an upper limit on the spinning dust polarisation .",
    "if indeed 30 per cent of the 31  ghz emission in @xmath7 is anomalous ( e.g. from spinning dust ) , then the effective upper limit to the polarisation fraction of this component is @xmath31  per cent . this is lower than that observed in the perseus cloud , @xmath32 , which was observed to have a polarisation fraction of @xmath33  per cent @xcite .",
    "such low levels of polarisation are consistent with electro - dipole emission from spinning grains .",
    "the slight discrepancy in polarisation level may be attributed to varying levels of ferromagnetic material , which through magneto - dipole emission can be much more highly polarised @xcite .",
    "observations of 6 bright hii  regions suggest a small amount of excess emission at 31  ghz , based on fitting a free - free model from data in the literature .",
    "the dominant source of emission comes from optically thin free - free emission with a spectral index @xmath34 .",
    "but we find that all the sources were slightly brighter at 31  ghz relative to the simple free - free model .",
    "the average @xmath1 m dust emissivity for the 6 hii  regions was found to be @xmath2k  ( mjy / sr)@xmath3 , or a 95 per cent confidence limit of @xmath4k  ( mjy / sr)@xmath3 .",
    "this is lower by a factor of @xmath5 compared to cooler diffuse clouds at high galactic latitudes ( table  [ tab : emissivities ] ) .",
    "however , only one source , @xmath7 ( rcw49 ) , was found to be statistically significant with a @xmath1 m dust emissivity of @xmath35k  ( mjy / sr)@xmath3 ( @xmath6 ) . for this source ,",
    "there are several caveats in interpreting and using data from the literature , which could reduce the significance of this result .",
    "new data in the range @xmath36  ghz , particularly from well - calibrated instruments , are required to clarify whether our tentative detection holds .",
    "the dust emissivity , relative to the @xmath1 m map , for this object is consistent with that found in diffuse clouds at high galactic latitudes ( table  [ tab : emissivities ] ) . for the majority of the other sources ,",
    "only upper limits could be obtained which appear to show that the dust emissivity is in fact lower than that observed at high galactic latitudes .",
    "we observed very low level ( @xmath10 per cent ) polarisation at 31  ghz from all the hii  regions studied here .",
    "the level is consistent with that expected from instrumental leakage in the cbi instrument .",
    "this validates claims that the instrumental leakage is negligible ( @xmath37 per cent ) for recent detections of cmb polarisation with the cbi .",
