    "newtonian celestial mechanics typically describes the motion of widely - separated masses using two types of parameters ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . these concern either the behavior of each body as a whole  the `` external '' or `` bulk '' parameters  or the details of their internal dynamics .",
    "examples of external parameters are the center of mass positions and spin angular momenta of the various masses .",
    "the internal variables include , e.g. , the density and velocity distributions inside each body . in typical applications , there is very little coupling between the internal and external parameters . as a consequence , one can often compute the center of mass positions of each extended body in an @xmath0-body system as though that system were composed of point particles described only by their positions and masses .",
    "furthermore , the spin angular momentum of each body in such a system can usually be taken to remain constant ( and does not affect the center of mass motion ) .",
    "both of these statements are , of course , approximate .",
    "a more accurate description requires introducing additional parameters such as quadrupole moments .",
    "these depend on the internal dynamics , but in a relatively mild way that often lends itself to simple phenomenological models .",
    "the external variables decouple from the internal ones in newtonian gravity largely because the net force and torque exerted by a body s self - field always vanishes .",
    "there are no self - forces or self - torques in this theory below .",
    "note that this definition of self - force is not the same as the perturbative one used in , e.g. , @xcite . ] .",
    "the instantaneous evolution equations for an object s linear momentum , center of mass position , and spin do not explicitly involve its self - field .",
    "these quantities _ are _ affected by the self - field through its action on other objects , although this is an effect that takes time to accumulate .",
    "_ a priori _ , it is not clear that similar statements can be made for matter interacting with relativistic fields .",
    "such fields carry energy and momentum , so self - forces arise generically .",
    "this does not , however , preclude an internal - external split of the dynamics .",
    "the usefulness of such a split does not require that self - forces vanish entirely , but only that they do not depend in any essential way on the details of a body s internal structure .    to illustrate this point , consider the motion of a small electric charge in approximate internal equilibrium moving non - relativistically in flat spacetime .",
    "it has long been known that under suitable conditions , the center of mass acceleration @xmath1 of such a charge at time @xmath2 very nearly satisfies ) for all time is guaranteed to stay near the physical trajectory .",
    "many such motions violate the conditions under which the equation was derived ( even on short timescales ) , and must therefore be discarded .",
    "additionally , there may be neglected terms which lead to qualitatively different behavior over long times .",
    "better - behaved equations arise by `` reducing order '' @xcite , which changes ( [ ald ] ) only by an amount comparable to the error terms that are already present .",
    "this leads to an equation often attributed to landau and lifshitz in the relativistic case @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath3 here , @xmath4 is an externally - imposed force , @xmath5 is the object s total charge and @xmath6 its ( bare ) mass .",
    "the last two terms on the right - hand side of this equation arise from interactions with the body s own electromagnetic field .",
    "the first of these is `` simple '' in that it depends only on bulk parameters ",
    "namely @xmath5 and @xmath7  already required to describe the motion of a charged test particle .",
    "@xmath8 , by contrast , has a very different character . in an appropriate approximation , it is the self - energy of the charge distribution as it would typically be defined @xcite .",
    "denoting the electric charge density by @xmath9 , @xmath10 it is clear that @xmath8 depends on the body s internal structure in a nontrivial way . despite this , ( [ ald ] ) may be rewritten in the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is interpreted as a renormalized or effective mass . the same assumptions leading to the derivation of ( [ ald ] ) can also be used to show that @xmath13 . for a",
    "well - behaved extended object , @xmath8 is finite .",
    "the mass renormalization effect is therefore finite as well .",
    "even though the self - force is significant in this example ( and depends on nontrivial details of the body s internal structure ) , the final equation of motion involves only parameters of the same type as those already needed to describe the motion of a charged test particle . to the extent that ( [ ald ] ) can be trusted , this means that the external variables largely decouple from the internal ones in electromagnetism .",
    "the center of mass acceleration of an appropriate extended self - interacting charge distribution is the same as the acceleration of a monopole test charge moving in an effective electric field given by the external one plus @xmath14 ( at the particle s location ) .",
    "this effective field may be shown to arise naturally as a certain solution to the vacuum maxwell equations @xcite .",
    "this result can be generalized considerably .",
    "essentially all restrictions regarding the charge s size , internal dynamics , and speed may be removed . for almost any",
    "bounded _ self - interacting _ charge - current distribution in flat spacetime , physically reasonable linear and angular momenta may be defined that evolve as though they were the momenta of an extended _ test _ charge ( or a pointlike test charge `` with structure '' ) moving in a certain effective electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "this effective field satisfies the vacuum maxwell equations near the charge .",
    "all effects of the self - force and self - torque can be non - perturbatively absorbed into the definitions of the momenta and the effective field .",
    "whether or not the internal structure is `` effaced '' from the external laws of motion therefore reduces to a question regarding the nature of the effective field . in all but the most extreme systems , the effective field may be shown to depend only on bulk parameters like the total charge .",
    "very similar results also hold in generic ( but fixed ) curved spacetimes .",
    "the only qualitative change that occurs when introducing spacetime curvature is that the quadrupole and higher multipole of a charge s stress - energy tensor are renormalized along with its momenta @xcite .",
    "analogous statements are known for matter interacting with linear scalar fields as well @xcite .",
    "results of this type greatly expand the scope of  and provide a basis for  what has been referred to as the detweiler - whiting axiom @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that point particles are incompatible with , e.g. , the standard formulation of maxwell electrodynamics ( and with general relativity @xcite ) . despite this",
    ", `` point particle methods '' can still be used if additional axioms are introduced into the theory .",
    "suppose , for example , that a certain portion of the self - field associated with a pointlike electric charge is assumed not to affect its motion .",
    "detweiler and whiting considered this possibility with an ignorable field constructed using a certain symmetric green function @xcite .",
    "subtracting this field from the physical one leaves a result which is easily calculated and well - behaved .",
    "it also satisfies the vacuum maxwell equations at the location of the particle .",
    "substituting this difference field into the lorentz force equation produces the standard dewitt - brehme result @xcite for the motion of a self - interacting charged particle in curved spacetime .",
    "similar subtractions were also used to efficiently reproduce equations of motion that had previously been derived for self - interacting scalar charges as well as uncharged masses in linearized general relativity .",
    "the results of @xcite show that this ability to ignore what is referred to as the detweiler - whiting s - field is not merely a computational shortcut allowing the use of point particle methods in cases where actual point particles can not exist .",
    "a very general type of `` detweiler - whiting axiom '' may be rigorously _ derived _ from first principles for a large class of extended scalar and electromagnetic charge distributions moving in fixed spacetimes .",
    "this paper uses similar methods to treat the gravitational problem .",
    "specifically , it investigates whether the bulk dynamics of an uncharged mass in general relativity can be reduced to test body motion in an effective metric ( in a nontrivial sense . if @xmath15 , this is trivially equivalent to the motion of a pointlike test body in the field @xmath16 . in general relativity , equations with the form @xmath17",
    "can always be rewritten as geodesic equations associated with some connection .",
    "it is only in special cases , however , that such identifications are useful . ] ) .",
    "related questions have been studied in various contexts using the post - newtonian approximation @xcite , where they are often referred to as `` effacement principles '' or demonstrations of the strong equivalence principle .",
    "the work presented here is motivated more by the types of systems commonly encountered in discussions of the gravitational self - force .",
    "these discussions typically allow the body of interest to move at relativistic speeds in a strongly curved background spacetime , but restrict it to be small compared to all scales associated with that background .",
    "one also assumes that the internal structure of the body does not vary too rapidly . under these conditions",
    " made precise in , e.g. , @xcite  an equation of motion may be derived that does not depend on any details of the body s internal structure .",
    "at lowest order , it is just the geodesic equation associated with the background spacetime .",
    "the next approximation introduces forces due to both gravitational self - interaction and spin .",
    "the latter effect is the papapetrou force long known to act on spinning test particles @xcite .",
    "the self - force component is typically referred to as the misataquwa force after the authors who originally obtained it : mino , sasaki , tanaka , quinn , and wald @xcite . neglecting the papapetrou term ,",
    "the motion is most naturally viewed as geodesic with respect to a certain effective metric satisfying the linearized vacuum einstein equation @xcite .",
    "we show that this is a special case of a much more general result .",
    "certain definitions of linear and angular momentum are proposed for extended compact matter distributions in general relativity .",
    "it is assumed that there is no stress - energy near the object of interest other than its own ( except perhaps dark energy equivalent to a cosmological constant ) .",
    "an effective metric @xmath18 is then defined based on a non - perturbative generalization of the detweiler - whiting decomposition of the physical metric @xmath19 .",
    "there is a sense in which the force and torque depend only on @xmath18 and the details of the body s stress - energy tensor . if @xmath18 varies sufficiently slowly that it can be expanded in a taylor series about an appropriate point inside the body ( in a riemann normal coordinate system constructed using @xmath18 ) , the instantaneous force and torque are shown to be identical to those of an appropriate test body moving in the effective metric .",
    "a similar result also holds for a certain definition of the center of mass .",
    "this means that equations known to hold for test bodies ( possibly with higher multipole moments ) also hold for masses with significant self - interaction .    as a simple application , note that the simplest test bodies move on geodesics .",
    "the simplest self - interacting bodies therefore move on geodesics of the effective metric .",
    "the misataquwa expression for the gravitational self - force follows easily with some minor additional assumptions .",
    "similarly , the simplest equations for a body s spin evolution are those of parallel transport .",
    "appropriate self - gravitating masses therefore parallel - propagate their spins in the effective metric .",
    "corrections to these statements arising from higher order multipole moments are easily added when appropriate .",
    "the assumptions adopted here are different from those found in other treatments of the gravitational self - force .",
    "most importantly , the approaches of , e.g. , @xcite are intrinsically perturbative .",
    "they work in an intermediate `` buffer '' region outside of the body of interest and assume that the metric there is a small perturbation off of some vacuum background .",
    "such methods can be applied even to the motion of black holes , which lies beyond the scope of the formalism developed here .",
    "we require that a body be described by a well - behaved stress - energy tensor . despite this restriction ,",
    "there are considerable benefits to our assumptions .",
    "they allow the analysis of objects that may be highly distorted and dynamical : dixon s multipole expansions @xcite for the motion of extended test masses are generalized to all orders .",
    "explicit formulae for the momenta are also provided in terms of the body s internal structure .",
    "there are aesthetic advantages as well . in regimes where they overlap ,",
    "the method presented here requires far less computation than others in the literature .",
    "it also provides significantly more physical insight .",
    "the main results established in this work are obtained using only a modicum of computation . despite this",

    "[ sect : newtgrav ] starts by discussing in detail the motion of self - interacting masses in newtonian gravity . while the conclusions of this section are completely standard , the formulation used to obtain them has several unusual features .",

    "it also treats a body s linear and angular momenta as different components of a single scalar functional on the space of euclidean killing fields .",

    "the main goal of this paper is to describe , in some sense , the large - scale or bulk motion of extended masses in general relativity .",
    "this is done by analyzing quantities that may be interpreted as a body s net linear and angular momenta ( as well as the closely related notion of its center of mass ) .",
    "the type of momentum considered here is similar to the one developed by dixon @xcite .",
    "mathematically , dixon s momenta are tensor fields defined non - perturbatively along a preferred worldline in the physical spacetime .",
    "they take as input this worldline and a timelike vector field prescribed along it . the linear or angular momentum of an extended body",
    "is then computed by integrating its stress - energy tensor over a spacelike hypersurface in a particular way .",
    "the evolution of these quantities is strongly constrained by stress - energy conservation .",
    "the only significant restriction to the use of dixon s momenta is that an object s stress - energy tensor be bounded in spatial directions .",
    "this bound is also required not to be `` extremely large '' in a particular sense @xcite .",
    "limitations on the metric are minimal . despite this",
    ", most applications ( e.g. , @xcite ) have been restricted to the test body regime where the body of interest is not allowed to backreact onto the geometry . while dixon s momenta retain a number of interesting properties in a more a general context @xcite",

    "for example , it has been shown that even in flat spacetime electromagnetism , the momenta do not behave as simply as might have been expected once electromagnetic self - interaction is taken into account @xcite .",
    "this problem can be eliminated with a relatively simple modification @xcite .",
    "similar changes are proposed here in order to obtain physically reasonable momenta that obey simple evolution equations in the presence of significant gravitational self - interaction ( but without electromagnetic or other long - range non - gravitational fields ) .",
    "the basic strategy is to first postulate `` bare '' momenta .",
    "these agree with dixon s definitions in the test mass regime , but differ in general .",
    "the important point is that the evolution equations for the bare momenta include total time derivatives of certain terms involving parts of the self - field .",
    "these derivatives are easily eliminated by redefining the momenta .",
    "the resulting variables obey simple evolution equations in a wide variety of contexts .",
    "this section sets the foundation for deriving these results by reviewing the relevant techniques in simpler systems .",
    "we start by discussing the motion of self - interacting extended masses in newtonian gravity .",
    "this is carried out from a somewhat unusual point of view introduced in @xcite .",
    "similar techniques are then used to analyze relativistic motion in a curved spacetime , but without self - interaction .",
    "the resulting definitions and conclusions are equivalent to dixon s @xcite",
    ". many aspects of the formalisms discussed in this section carry through almost without modification to cases involving self - interaction in general relativity .      as a first step to understanding the motion of extended bodies in general relativity , consider the motion of a freely - falling extended mass in newtonian gravity .",
    "such a mass may be modelled as having a time - dependent configuration on a three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath27 .",
    "we assume that this configuration has nonzero volume and may be entirely contained in a compact region @xmath28 at time @xmath2 ( i.e. , the body is extended but with a finite size ) .",
    "also suppose that the body of interest is composed of a single material with mass density @xmath29 and 3-velocity @xmath30 .",
    "given any @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "while it is possible to relax this requirement considerably , we assume for simplicity that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are smooth in both of their arguments .",
    "lastly , suppose that there exists an open neighborhood of @xmath34 containing no matter other than the body of interest .",
    "this ensures that there is no direct contact with other objects .    in general ,",
    "the density and velocity distributions are constrained by local mass and momentum conservation .",
    "these laws have the explicit forms @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the levi - civita connection associated with the euclidean 3-metric @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath38 represents the body s stress tensor , @xmath39 the gravitational potential , and @xmath40 the inverse of @xmath41 . besides these equations",
    ", the body of interest is also assumed to be a source for the gravitational field .",
    "the potential therefore satisfies @xmath42 throughout @xmath34 .",
    "the simplest consequence of these equations is that the total mass @xmath6 can not change .",
    "using @xmath43 to denote the natural ( three - dimensional ) volume element associated with @xmath19 , let @xmath44 it immediately follows from ( [ masscons ] ) that @xmath6 is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "( [ momentumcons ] ) constrains the evolution of the body s total linear momentum @xmath45 and angular momentum @xmath46 .",
    "the linear momentum is typically defined by integrating the components @xmath47 in a cartesian coordinate system @xmath48 . a similar integral also exists for the angular momentum .",
    "it is important for later generalizations to avoid any coordinate choices such as these and instead define the momenta geometrically .",
    "this can be accomplished by recalling that global linear momentum conservation is associated with the translational invariance of euclidean space .",
    "similarly , global angular momentum conservation is related to the rotational invariance of euclidean space .",
    "translations and rotations together comprise the continuous isometries of @xmath27 .",
    "generators of these isometries are killing vectors .    given any euclidean killing field @xmath49 and time @xmath2 , consider @xmath50 this is a linear functional on the six - dimensional space of killing fields .",
    "it may be viewed as returning the component of momentum `` conjugate '' to @xmath49 . if , say , @xmath51 is a particular killing field associated with translations in the @xmath52-direction , @xmath53 is equal to the euclidean component @xmath54 of the body s linear momentum as it would ordinarily be defined .",
    "similarly , use of a purely rotational killing field in ( [ pxinewt ] ) returns a component of the body s angular momentum .    in general , @xmath55 is equal to a sum of linear and angular momentum components .",
    "the precise form of this sum may be established by recalling that any killing field is fixed everywhere by specifying it and its first derivative at a single point @xcite . choosing a ( possibly time - dependent ) origin @xmath56 , @xmath57 this correspondence",
