    "in standard cosmology , the acoustic oscillations imprinted in the matter power spectrum at recombination have a length scale that can be accurately calculated based on measurements of the cmb anisotropy power spectrum @xcite .",
    "it should then be possible to measure this `` standard ruler '' scale at low redshifts , for example in large galaxy redshift surveys , and thereby constrain the matter and energy content of the universe @xcite .",
    "however , if the cmb measurements were misled by some new physics , e.g.  a new undetected relativistic particle , then the misinterpretation could potentially spread to the low - redshift application and bias the inferences .    here",
    ", we show that the interpretation of the low - redshift acoustic oscillations are robust if the cmb correctly tells us the baryon - to - photon ratio and the epoch of matter - radiation equality . these quantities are robustly measured in the cmb .",
    "the actual densities of matter and radiation drop out of the calculation ; only their ratio matters .",
    "the result is that even if the physical matter density @xmath0 is misinterpreted from the cmb due to undetected relativistic components , the inferences for dark energy from the combined cmb and low - redshift survey data sets are unchanged .",
    "knowledge of actual densities , e.g.  @xmath1 , translates into improved constraints on the hubble constant , @xmath2 .",
    "the acoustic peak method depends upon measuring the sound horizon , which is the comoving distance that a sound wave can travel between the end of inflation and the epoch of recombination @xcite .",
    "nearly all of this distance is accumulated just prior to the epoch of recombination at @xmath3 .",
    "the sound horizon integral depends only on the hubble parameter @xmath4 and the sound speed @xmath5 in the baryon - photon plasma . if we assume dark energy is sub - dominant at @xmath6 , then @xmath7 where @xmath8 is epoch of matter - radiation equality .",
    "the sound speed depends only on the baryon - to - photon ratio and is @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "these two produce the sound horizon @xmath11 where ` rec ' and ` eq ' refer to recombination and equality respectively .",
    "one sees that the aside from a prefactor of @xmath12 , the sound horizon depends only on the baryon - to - photon ratio and the redshift of equality .",
    "the epoch of recombination , being controlled by atomic physics , is very insensitive to the cosmology . for reasonable changes in the early universe and our current uncertainties of the theory of recombination @xcite ,",
    "any shift in @xmath13 is negligible .",
    "the baryon - to - photon ratio is also exquisitely well measured in the cmb power spectrum by both the ratios of the odd and even acoustic peaks and by the silk damping tail @xcite .",
    "the former effect depends only on the gravitational inertia of the baryons driven by the potentials near the epoch of recombination .",
    "thus the modulation gives us a precise measurement of the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath14 , which with our precise knowledge of @xmath15 fixes @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , for the established value of @xmath17 near @xmath18 , the effect on the sound horizon is already small .",
    "it seems very likely that the cmb will determine the baryon - to - photon ratio to sufficient accuracy for this portion of the sound horizon computation @xcite .",
    "information about matter - radiation equality is encoded in the amplitudes of the peaks through the manner in which the potentials evolve as they cross the horizon : the potential envelope @xcite .",
    "measurements of the potential envelope thus robustly constrain equality .",
    "normally , one interprets this constraint as the matter density @xmath1 , on the assumption that the photons and standard neutrino background are the full radiation density .",
    "however , one could imagine other relativistic components , and in this case , measuring the redshift of equality does not imply the matter density @xmath1 ( we continue to assume that the extra components are `` undetected '' in the cmb and return to this point in the next section ) . as we can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rsound ] ) , the dependence of @xmath19 on @xmath20 is relatively small since @xmath21 , thus even a crude determination suffices to fix @xmath19 up to an overall factor of @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath22 is very well measured .",
    "the sound horizon decreases by only 5% if @xmath20 is lowered by @xmath23 !",
    "understanding the acoustic oscillations at @xmath3 allows us to translate knowledge of the sound horizon into knowledge of wavelength of the baryonic features in the mass power spectrum up to the same normalization uncertainty .",
    "we then wish to consider the measurement of this scale at lower redshift , such as could be accomplished in large galaxy surveys .",
    "measuring the scale along and across the line of sight , as a redshift or angular scale , constrains @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "for dark energy with ( constant ) equation of state @xmath26 , the low - redshift quantities can be written as @xmath27^{-1/2},\\ ] ] and ( for zero curvature ) @xmath28^{-1/2}.\\ ] ] because @xmath29 is well constrained , we find that the observations actually constrain @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite , which contain only the terms that depend on the bare @xmath32 values , , where @xmath33 is equation [ eq : da ] .",
    "but we can write @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the usual curvature term .",
    "this substitution shows that @xmath36 depends only on the bare @xmath32 s . ]",
    "i.e. , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , etc . in other words ,",
    "the prefactors of @xmath12 have canceled out between @xmath19 and the low - redshift distances .",
    "we can thus reliably predict the distance _ ratios _ between low @xmath39 and @xmath3 as a function of redshift and hence constrain cosmology .",
    "what has happened is simply that the overall scale of the universe does nt affect any of the distance ratios .",
    "usually this scale is labeled as the hubble constant , such that @xmath40 drops out .",
    "we have rephrased the scale as @xmath1 , despite the fact that this would appear to include @xmath37 in addition to @xmath40 . another way of saying this is that the standard ruler defined by the cmb at constant redshift of equality actually scales as @xmath41 .",
    "hence , even @xmath42 redshift - space measurements of this ruler do not measure @xmath40 , but instead measure @xmath43 .",
    "parameter estimation for acoustic oscillations based on standard models @xcite will be unchanged by the presence of undetectable new radiation provided that the redshift of equality is measured correctly .",
    "only the hubble constant would be incorrect . in the context of cmb parameter estimation , it would be more useful to report @xmath44 rather than @xmath19 itself , as this is the quantity that isolates the cosmological densities at low redshift .",
    "massive neutrinos should be counted as radiation at @xmath45 but would be counted as matter at low redshift .",
    "that does create a small error in the dark energy inferences .",
    "one would be computing @xmath46 from the cmb , but the low - redshift distances in equations ( [ eq : h ] ) and ( [ eq : da ] ) would still have prefactors of @xmath47 . as the observations constrain @xmath25 and @xmath24 , the evaluation of these quantities in terms of bare @xmath32 s will be altered by @xmath48 . for the massive neutrino fraction inferred for non - degenerate neutrino species and the atmospheric neutrino mass",
    "splitting @xcite this is a 0.2% correction ; however , it could be a few percent correction at the upper limit of the allowed masses for degenerate neutrino species @xcite .",
    "fortunately , such neutrino masses should be detectable in upcoming data due to their suppression of the late - time matter power spectrum @xcite .    because the integral for the sound horizon extends to early times ( essentially to the time when the cosmic perturbations were established ) , alterations to the hubble parameter ( eq .  [ [ eq : h ] ] )",
    "could alter the sound horizon even at fixed redshift of equality .",
    "for example , there might exist a non - relativistic particle that decays into relativistic unseen particles sometime prior to recombination @xcite .",
    "however , such decays create alterations to the gravitational potentials that would be detectable in the cmb if the horizon scale at that epoch is visible in the primary anisotropies ( i.e. , wavenumbers @xmath49 ) .",
    "this makes decays at @xmath50 difficult to hide .",
    "furthermore , such decays alter the transfer function and would affect the amplitude of the late - time matter power spectrum .",
    "precision measurement of the matter power spectrum out to @xmath51 from the lyman - alpha forest could push the limits on particle decays to earlier times . in the standard theory , the first 1% of the sound horizon integral",
    "is contributed by @xmath52 .",
    "it therefore seems very unlikely that a decaying particle could significantly affect the sound horizon ( relative to the standard theory at fixed redshift of equality ) and escape detection in the cmb or large - scale structure .    as a corollary",
    ", it is interesting to note that when one measures the acoustic oscillation scale at @xmath13 with the cmb and at some low redshift @xmath53 in a galaxy survey , one can construct an observable ( the difference of the suitably scaled angular wavenumbers of the acoustic peaks ) that isolates the cosmology between @xmath53 and @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath54 this integral is trivial when the universe is completely matter - dominated .",
    "hence , if we can perform a galaxy survey at some suitably high redshift , e.g. , @xmath55 , where the dark energy is supposed to be negligible , we could search for dynamical shenanigans at @xmath56 . a photometric - redshift survey over large amount of sky",
    "would be an economical route to this goal , as one can acquire very large survey volumes @xcite .",
    "we have argued that only the ratios of the radiation and matter densities enter the acoustic oscillation standard ruler method , but of course it is interesting to measure the actual values of the densities as they might reveal new relativistic components or unexpected evolution .",
    "the cmb is sensitive to the non - photon radiation density primarily through its effect on equality and the evolution of the potentials .",
    "this encodes a sensitivity to both the amount of radiation and its quadrupole moment . in general any particle that free streams rather than behaves as a fluid will have a local quadrupole that will affect the evolution of the potentials and thus the anisotropy in the cmb",
    "this breaks the degeneracy in the cmb between changes in @xmath1 and @xmath57 @xcite and allows us to constrain a `` conventional '' neutrino at the @xmath58 level @xcite . at the other extreme , extra radiation which is of the perfect fluid form leads to an increase in the small - scale power which",
    "is easily discerned from a change in @xmath1 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cl ] ) . only a radiation component",
    "whose higher moments track closely that of the traditional mix of photons and neutrinos could be confused with a change in @xmath1 .",
    "altering the radiation and matter density while holding the baryon ( and photon ) densities fixed would alter the baryon fraction @xmath59 and would produce significant offsets in the late - time matter power spectrum ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "higher baryon fractions suppress power on small scales compared to large , with the transition occurring near the sound horizon at @xmath60 .",
    "the acoustic oscillations shortward of this scale would also be increased .",
    "the small - scale amplitude ( e.g. , @xmath61 ) would be reduced .",
    "these changes are observable in galaxy surveys , weak lensing surveys , and cluster abundance measurements .",
    "of course one can also directly measure the hubble constant @xcite .    in short ,",
    "although the acoustic peak method depends only on the redshift of equality , other cosmological measurements both at @xmath62 and at @xmath63 are well poised to measure the actual densities and thereby constrain the presence of unknown relativistic species .",
    "we have shown that the standard ruler defined by the acoustic oscillations prior to recombination can deal gracefully with uncertainties in the matter density @xmath64 provided that the redshift of matter - radiation equality is well measured .",
    "the anisotropies of the cmb have very good leverage on this quantity , and so the acoustic peak method of probing dark energy is robust .",
    "in addition , it is likely that the cmb , perhaps in combination with other probes , will be able to constrain the actual matter and radiation densities .",
