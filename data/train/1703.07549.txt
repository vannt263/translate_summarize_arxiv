    "<S> the slight derivation from the chern number of the isolated band is caused by the imperfect initial state .    </S>",
    "<S> the topological resonant tunneling is a result of the interplay among the inter - particle interaction , the double - well bias and the band topology . to make it more clear , we analyse a non - interacting system of @xmath103 and the initial state given as the mlmpws @xmath104 </S>",
    "<S> . such an initial state can be decomposed as @xmath105 , with the symmetric single - particle state @xmath106 and the anti - symmetric single - particle state @xmath107  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetric ( anti - symmetric ) states respectively fill the lower ( upper ) bands of the single - particle rice - mele model . </S>",

    "<S> position shift one unit cell along right ( left ) in one pumping cycle  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> _ summary and discussions_.we have put forward a new concept of mpwss and studied the thouless pumping of strongly interacting bosons in rice - mele lattices . </S>",
    "<S> the set of mpwss provides an orthogonal basis and their c.o.m . </S>",
    "<S> shifts in thouless pumping are proportional to the chern numbers of the filled multi - particle bloch bands . by minimizing the spread functional of mpwss </S>",
    "<S> , one can generate the mlmpwss , which can used as perfectly initial states for implementing thouless pumping . </S>",
    "<S> if the interaction energy is much larger than the double - well bias , a bound state will be unidirectionally transported through one double - well cell as a whole during one pumping cycle . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the double - well bias may balance the interaction , the interplay between resonant tunneling and band topology will drive the two bosons unidirectionally through the barrier one by one . in both thouless pumping of bound state and topologically resonant tunneling , the two bosons will be shifted integer double - well cells in one pumping cycle .    to apply the mpws concept to many - body problems </S>",
    "<S> , one needs to find an efficient method to reduce the computational resource . </S>",
    "<S> matrix product state is a powerful method for many - body calculations  @xcite , such as the many - body dispersion relations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mpws may be expressed with the matrix product sate representation and then one can used it for exploring fractional topological states .    </S>",
    "<S> note added : in the process of preparing our manuscript , we became aware of the thouless pumping of three attractive photons in one dimensional nonlinear resonator arrays  @xcite .    </S>",
