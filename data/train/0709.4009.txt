    "in recent years the processes of the meson production have been extensively studied in the context of understanding the strong interaction , responsible for the existence of hadrons .",
    "the growth of the database of the observables connected with the meson production in the hadronic collisions made possible the verification of the predictions of the effective theories .",
    "a particular interest has been put on the studies of the properties of the @xmath1 meson  @xcite . despite the fact that the discovery of this meson took place over forty years ago  @xcite",
    "its production mechanism still remains unknown .",
    "understanding of the production process of the @xmath1 meson may allow the theoretical models to be revisited with new input parameters : the coupling constants in the description of the production process of the @xmath1 meson , the initial and final state interactions and also dimensions of the reaction region .    from precise measurements of the total cross sections of the @xmath1 meson production in the @xmath2 reaction  @xcite",
    "it was concluded  @xcite that this process proceeds through the excitation of one of the protons to the s@xmath3(1535 ) state which subsequently deexcites via the emission of the @xmath1 meson ( see fig .",
    "[ pion ] ) .    in practice , within the meson exchange picture , the excitation of the intermediate resonance can be induced by exchange of any of the pseudoscalar or vector ground state mesons between the nucleons  @xcite .",
    "based on the excitation function only it was , however , impossible to disentangle the contributions to the production process originating from the @xmath4 , @xmath1 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 meson exchange .",
    "+ more constraints to theoretical models  @xcite have been deduced from the measurement of the isospin dependence of the total cross section by the wasa / promice collaboration  @xcite   production which may also be sensitive to gluonic production mechanism  @xcite . ] .",
    "the comparison of the @xmath1 meson production in proton - proton and proton - neutron collisions revealed that the @xmath1 meson is by a factor of twelve more copiously produced when the total isospin of the nucleons is zero with respect to the case when it equals to one .",
    "as a consequence an isovector meson exchange is strongly favoured as being responsible for such a strong isospin dependence .",
    "this result was already a large step forward but still the relative contributions of the @xmath6 and @xmath4 mesons remained to be established .",
    "for this purpose we have determined the analysing power for the @xmath0 reaction since its theoretical value  @xcite is sensitive to the assumption on the type of exchanged meson .",
    "the first test measurement of the analysing power for the @xmath0 reaction at the excess energy of q  =  40  mev has been performed by the cosy-11 collaboration in the year 2001 .",
    "the method of the analysis and the results have been reported in  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the data from this tentative measurement are bared with rather large error bars , and at the level of accuracy obtained in this experiment no constructive statement could have been done in order to distinguish between two different hypotheses of the @xmath1 meson production .",
    "similarly , the intepratation of the data obtained by the disto collaboration  @xcite , performed in the far - from - threshold region at the excess energies of q  =  324 , 412 , and 554  mev suffered from the lack of a theoretical prediction for the analysing power .",
    "this is due to the fact that far from the reaction threshold the higher partial waves are involved in the reaction process , making the theoretical description complicated .",
    "further investigations were necessary and two additional experiments devoted to the determination of the analysing power for the @xmath0 reaction in the close - to - threshold region have been performed by the cosy-11 collaboration . in this paper",
    "we shall briefly present the experimental method and summarize results from these two measurements .",
    "for the details of the analysis the interested reader is referred to the reference  @xcite .",
    "experiments have been performed utilizing the cosy-11 facility  @xcite at the cooler synchrotron and storage ring cosy  @xcite in the research center jlich , germany .",
    "the analysing powers have been measured during two runs at different beam momenta : p@xmath7  =  2.010  gev / c ( may 2003 ) and 2.085  gev / c ( september 2002 ) , which for the @xmath0 reaction correspond to the excess energies of q  =  10 and 36  mev , respectively .",
    "cosy-11 detection setup is described in  @xcite .",
    "a vertically polarised proton beam  @xcite had been stored and accelerated in the cosy ring .",
    "the target  @xcite is installed in front of the accelerator s dipole magnet acting as a momentum separator for the charged reaction products .",
    "the positively charged ejectiles are registered in drift chambers and scintillator hodoscopes . for each particle",
    "its direction of motion and time of flight on a nine meter distance was measured .",
    "tracking back these trajectories through the known magnetic field inside the dipole magnet to the reaction vertex allows for the momentum reconstruction .",
    "independent determination of momentum and velocity from the time - of - flight measurement permitted the identification of the charged particles .",
    "the @xmath1 meson has been identified on the basis of a missing mass technique .    for the determination of the analysing power of the @xmath1 meson at a given value of the polar angle @xmath8 and the azimuthal angle @xmath9 one has to measure a left - right asymmetry of the yields of the @xmath1 meson production .",
    "the process of production is considered in the so called _ madison coordinate frame _  @xcite , which in our case has its @xmath10 axis parallel to the @xmath11 vector , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 denoting the momentum vectors of the proton beam and the @xmath1 meson in the center - of - mass system , respectively .",
    "the @xmath14 axis of the madison coordinate frame is along the @xmath12 vector , and the @xmath15 axis completes the right - handed coordinate frame .",
    "the cosy-11 detection setup is an asymmetrical aparatus , hence in the case of the @xmath0 reaction , the acceptance for events where the @xmath1 meson is produced to the left side with respect to the polarisation plane is far larger as compared to the events where it is emitted to the right .",
    "therefore , the left - right asymmetries are determined from numbers of events with the @xmath1 meson production to the left side , measured for the spin up and spin down modes of the beam polarisation .",
    "additionally , the acceptance of the cosy-11 facility allows to register only events scattered near the horizontal plane . in the analysis the azimuthal angle @xmath9 was restricted to values of @xmath16 ranging between 0.87 and 1 .",
    "let us define @xmath17 and @xmath18 as production yields of the @xmath1 meson emitted to the left around the @xmath8 angle as measured with the up and down beam polarisation , respectively , i.e. @xmath19 with @xmath20 denoting the cross section for the @xmath1 meson production for unpolarised beam , @xmath21 standing for the polarisation degree corresponding to spin up and down modes , e@xmath22 being the efficiency of the cosy-11 facility for detecting the @xmath1 meson emitted to the left side at the @xmath8 angle and @xmath23 denoting the luminosity during the beam polarisation up and down .",

    "[ yields1 ] and  [ yields2 ] for a@xmath27 we obtain : @xmath28    therefore in order to calculate the analysing power one has to measure the relative luminosity @xmath29 , the average beam polarisation @xmath30 , and the production yields @xmath17 and @xmath18 .      the relative luminosity for both excess energies has been determined by means of the measurement of coincidence rate in the polarisation plane  @xcite . due to parity invariance for strong interactions , the differential cross section for any two - body nuclear reaction in the polarisation plane does not depend on the magnitude of polarisation .",
    "thus , the number of reactions measured in the polarisation plane is proportional to the integrated luminosity over the time of measurement .",
    "the ratio of the numbers of events during spin up and down modes were used as a measure of the relative luminosity .",
    "values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 have been obtained at the excess energies of q  =  10 and 36  mev , respectively .",
    "the beam polarisation measurements have been performed with three independent detection setups . in the run at the excess energy of q  =  10  mev",
    "the cosy-11 polarimeter has been used  @xcite as the main equipment to extract the information about the value of the polarisation degree . during this",
    "run a cross - check of the method was done by means of the cosy polarimeter  @xcite , and for the measurement at the excess energy of q  =  36  mev the edda detection setup  @xcite has been exploited .    in all measurements",
    "the left - right asymmetry for the @xmath33 reaction was determined , and the polarisation was derived using the data base of the analysing powers for the @xmath33 reaction , measured by the edda collaboration in the wide range of beam momenta and scattering angles  @xcite . for the detailed description of detector setups used for the polarisation determination the reader is referred to  @xcite .",

    "however , the latter calculation used the proton asymmetry ( @xmath48 ) in eta photoproduction  @xcite , within the framework of the vector meson dominance model  @xcite , as the basis of their estimate .",
    "it should be noted that it has proved hard to reconcile the experimental value of @xmath48 with the results of photoproduction amplitude analyses  @xcite .",
    "taking into account the @xmath38 analysis of the analysing power for the pseudoscalar and vector meson exchange models we have shown that the predictions of the pseudoscalar meson exchange dominance  @xcite are in line with the experimental data at the significance level of 0.81 . on the other hand , the assumption that the @xmath1 meson is produced solely via the exchange of the @xmath6 meson  @xcite , leads to the discrepancy between the theoretical predictions and experimental data larger than four standard deviations .",
    "it must be stated , however , that the production amplitude for the @xmath6 meson exchange was determined based on the vector meson dominance hypothesis and the photoproduction data  @xcite . at this point",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the recent calculations of the @xmath1 meson production in the nn collisions performed in the framework of the effective lagrangian model  @xcite also indicate the dominance of the pion exchange .",
    "the analysing power values for both excess energies are consistent with zero within one standard deviation .",
    "this is in line with the results obtained by the disto  @xcite collaboration in the far - from - threshold energy region .",
