    "the absence of superpartners with masses degenerate to those of the standard model particles assures us that supersymmetry ( susy ) is broken if it is present in nature . however , arbitrary patterns of supersymmetry breaking masses give flavor - changing neutral current rates in gross violation of current experimental bounds .",
    "this is known as the susy flavor problem .",
    "anomaly - mediated supersymmetry breaking @xcite represents an attractive solution to this problem . in anomaly mediation , the breaking of scale invariance mediates supersymmetry breaking between the visible and the hidden sectors .",
    "( for an expanded review of this point , see @xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "the supersymmetry breaking terms can be written entirely in terms of beta functions and anomalous dimensions _ at any given energy_. this means that the susy breaking terms are independent of any flavor - dependent physics that might occur at high scales .",
    "this is the anomaly - mediated solution to the susy flavor problem .",
    "while the anomaly - mediated contribution to supersymmetry breaking is always present , its effect can be sub - dominant . for the anomaly mediation to solve the susy flavor problem ,",
    "other contributions to supersymmetry breaking must be somehow suppressed . in its original incarnation , this suppression was accomplished through a spatial separation of the visible and hidden sectors in an extra - dimension , which was thought to have the effect of `` sequestering '' the hidden sector @xcite .    the theory of anomaly mediation as described above suffers from two difficulties .",
    "first , as was shown in detail in @xcite , the geometric separation of the visible and hidden sectors is insufficient to sequester the hidden sector .",
    "in fact in most cases , the exchange of fields in the bulk supergravity multiplet is sufficient to generate a contribution to universal scalar masses at the tree level , completely swamping the anomaly - mediated piece .",
    "perhaps the simplest counter - example to geometric sequestering appeared in the model of radion - mediated supersymmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the second problem facing anomaly mediation is a direct result of its ultraviolet ( uv ) insensitivity .",
    "this property renders anomaly mediation an extremely predictive framework , considered to be a desirable feature .",
    "however , one prediction is a negative mass squared for the sleptons , rendering the theory phenomenologically inviable .",
    "neither of the above problems are insurmountable . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the sequestering could take place in a completely four dimensional framework where the problem of bulk moduli is absent , using conformal field theories . in this case , the sequestering remains effective as long as there are no moduli coupled to both the hidden and the mssm sectors .",
    "this four dimensional solution is reviewed in section [ sec:4d ] .",
    "the problem of tachyonic sleptons has also been overcome @xcite .",
    "however , no explicit model exists that both effectively sequesters the supersymmetry breaking sector and provides a phenomenologically viable spectrum . in this paper",
    "we provide the first such model , a viable model of anomaly mediation in four dimensions .    to provide the masses for the sleptons , we select the mechanism of @xcite , which gives masses through the addition of @xmath0-terms .",
    "we find this mechanism particularly attractive , as it gives masses without sacrificing the property of uv insensitivity .",
    "we review this mechanism in section [ sec : viable ] , before moving on and presenting our model in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "the concerns about geometric sequestering raised in @xcite can be addressed by utilizing the framework of luty and sundrum @xcite , in which the sequestering of anomaly mediation is realized in a completely four - dimensional way .",
    "this framework is inspired by the ads / cft correspondence @xcite which conjectures that a 5d theory of gravity in anti - desitter space is dual to a four dimensional conformal field theory .",
    "one can hope that this duality can be stretched further to a duality between the five dimensional brane world scenario and a four dimensional conformal field theory . with this in mind",
    "we can expect that the sequestering attempted in @xcite with an extra dimension might be realized in a 4d model in which the hidden sector is conformal .",
    "luty and sundrum showed this is indeed the case by looking at 4d theory with the hidden sector being susy qcd with @xmath1 ( _ i.e. _ the theory is in the seiberg conformal window @xcite ) .",
    "the main goal of sequestering is to suppress flavor violating operators of the form @xmath2 that might lead to large flavor - changing effects . here",
    "@xmath3 are fields in the ( conformal ) hidden sector , @xmath4 are fields in the visible sector , and @xmath5 can be the reduced planck scale .",
    "it is convenient to treat such a term as a correction to the hidden sector uv khler potential @xmath6 below a certain energy , the gauge coupling , @xmath7 , of the hidden sector nears its fixed point value , @xmath8 , allowing us to keep only the leading order in @xmath9 in the renormalization group equations for the coupling and the wavefunction renormalization . defining @xmath10 , the expansion yields : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are positive critical exponents , due to the fact that they describe dynamics near an infrared fixed point .",
    "for simplicity we will assume eq .",
    "( [ eq : rge ] ) is valid already at @xmath5 ; this assumption will not change the final result of sequestering .",
    "the conformal symmetry will eventually be broken by one of the fields in the hidden sector getting a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath14 , away from the origin of the moduli space .",
    "now , we can proceed to demonstrate the sequestering . if at the scale @xmath15 , we were already at the fixed point , @xmath16 , integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : rge ] ) would give @xmath17 when considering small perturbations about the fixed point , @xmath18 , it is convenient to factor out the above fixed point running by defining @xmath19 after integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : rge ] ) down to the scale of conformal symmetry breaking , @xmath14 , we find that the dependence of @xmath20 on @xmath21 is highly suppressed .",
    "this is simply a restatement of the fact that until the symmetry is broken , the theory is nearly conformal , so that deformations introduced at the high scale quickly become irrelevant as the theory is driven toward its fixed point .    in particular , if we make the choice that the value of the holomorphic gauge coupling in the nsvz scheme .",
    "] at the planck scale is equal to its value at the fixed point , which can be done without a loss of generality , we can write : @xmath22 the flavor violating operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : contact ] ) are therefore power suppressed and the hidden sector is sequestered . for details of this derivation , see references @xcite .    in @xcite a model of a conformally sequestered hidden sector is achieved completely naturally , generating all hierarchies dynamically . in the sections that follow , we will assume that the hidden sector is sequestered by this mechanism , leaving anomaly mediation as the leading contribution to visible sector soft masses .",
    "for anomaly mediation to be viable , the tachyonic sleptons must be eliminated .",
    "this may be accomplished by adding @xmath0-terms for @xmath23 and hypercharge . in reference",
    "@xcite the generation of a @xmath0-term for @xmath24 is accomplished by appealing to an extra - dimensional framework .",
    "we have already mentioned that the extra - dimensional framework is problematic as a realization of anomaly mediation , so we will have to modify this mechanism , which we do in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "the extra - dimensional set - up of @xcite contains three branes : a visible sector , a sequestered sector , and a sector responsible for the breaking of @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath24 gauge field is allowed to propagate in the bulk , but is broken at a high scale unlike in the gaugino - mediation models @xcite .",
    "we now review the process by which the @xmath24 breaking sector provides a @xmath0-term .",
    "the @xmath24 consists of the superpotential @xmath25 here , the @xmath26 and @xmath27 fields have @xmath24 charge @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , while @xmath30 is @xmath24 neutral . in the supersymmetric limit , @xmath31 . as long as @xmath26 and @xmath27 have different soft supersymmetry breaking masses , perhaps from additional yukawa couplings not shown in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : u1breaking ] ) , their vevs will shift by different amounts after the effects of supersymmetry breaking are included @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-term is found to be proportional to the difference in the vevs , so @xmath32 generically , the @xmath0-term will be of the same order of the soft masses - squared , which is the necessary condition for a viable spectrum .",
    "the @xmath0-term contributes to the scalar masses - squared for all fields charged under the relevant symmetry , in this case , @xmath23 .",
    "the unique feature of this solution to the problem of tachyonic sleptons is its insensitivity to physics in the ultraviolet .",
    "more precisely , the new expressions for the soft masses : @xmath33 remain on renormalization group trajectories .",
    "this can be shown by either explicitly examining the form of the renormalization group equations @xcite , or by a spurion argument @xcite .",
    "the spurion argument also shows clearly that soft parameters remain on rge trajectories even as heavy particle thresholds are crossed .    as mentioned above ,",
    "@xmath0-terms for both @xmath24 and @xmath34 are needed to generate a viable spectrum @xcite . however , once a @xmath0-term for @xmath24 is generated , a @xmath0-term for @xmath34 is naturally generated by including a term for kinetic mixing in the lagrangian , @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to consider a mechanism to generate @xmath36 .",
    "the `` anomaly mediation plus @xmath0-terms '' scenario above was originally envisaged in an extra - dimensional framework .",
    "if we transport this scenario to a four - dimensional one , we require that the scale of the @xmath24 breaking be much less than the planck scale . otherwise , it is possible to generate phenomenologically dangerous contributions to the soft masses of the mssm field . to be concrete ,",
    "consider the lepton doublet , @xmath37 .",
    "operators in the khler potential of the form @xmath38 will generate soft masses for the sleptons once the vev for the @xmath0-term is substituted for @xmath39 .",
    "a key point is that @xmath40 generically will not be equal to the charge of the @xmath37 field .",
    "these contributions will take the masses off of the anomaly - mediated trajectory , and spoil the uv insensitivity .",
    "these operators could arise from integrating out heavy particles charged under the @xmath24 symmetry , whose masses are at the planck scale . symmetry whose yukawa couplings to @xmath26 and @xmath27 give those fields different soft masses .",
    "] therefore , a requirement for a viable four dimensional model is that we dynamically generate the scale of the @xmath24 breaking .",
    "we present such a model in the next section .",
    "our goal , then , is to produce a model that naturally generates a @xmath0-term of the correct scale without introducing operators that spoil the uv - insensitivity . looking at sections [ sec:4d ] and [ sec : viable ] , it is clear what we need to do .",
    "again , we will have three sectors : a visible sector containing the mssm , a nearly conformal hidden sector , and a @xmath24 breaking sector .",
    "the nearly conformal sector can be neatly lifted from reference @xcite .",
    "our task is to generate a superpotential similar to that in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : u1breaking ] ) dynamically .",
    "this will generate the @xmath0-terms , allowing for a phenomenologically viable spectrum .",
    "the sector that we use to break the @xmath41 gauge symmetry and produce the @xmath0-term is given in table  [ tab : content ] .",

    "<S> anomaly mediation of supersymmetry breaking solves the supersymmetric flavor problem thanks to its ultraviolet - insensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> however , it suffers from two problems : sleptons have negative masses - squared , and there are likely bulk moduli that spoil the framework . here , we present the first fully ultraviolet - insensitive model of anomaly mediation with positive slepton masses - squared in a purely four - dimensional framework . </S>",
