    "understanding the complex dynamical evolution of protoplanetary disks ( ppds ) is of key interest both for building a comprehensive theory of planet formation , and as a means of explaining the observationally inferred properties of these objects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) .",
    "for example , ppds are known to accrete gas onto their host stars at a typical rate of @xmath1 @xcite and have life times in the range @xmath2@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "more recent observations have indicated the presence of turbulence in the disks surrounding the young stars tw  hydrae and hd  163296 , based on analysis of their molecular line emission @xcite .",
    "further evidence for turbulent broadening comes , for instance , from the co rovibrational band head shape measured by @xcite in v1331 cygni . during the t  tauri ( class ii ) phase , self - gravity",
    "is expected to provide a negligible contribution to angular momentum transport ( due to the low disk - to - star mass ratio ) , and disk accretion is instead believed to be driven by magnetic effects .",
    "two possible sources of angular momentum transport are through a magnetocentrifugally driven wind @xcite , or through the operation of the magnetorotational instability ( mri , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whose nonlinear outcome in the ideal - mhd limit is magnetohydrodynamic turbulence @xcite .    except for the innermost regions of ppds , where the temperature @xmath4 , and the ionization of alkali metals such as sodium and potassium provides strong coupling between the gas and magnetic field @xcite , non - ideal mhd effects such as ohmic resistivity , ambipolar diffusion ( ad ) and hall drift are expected to be important due to the low ionization levels of the gas ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "external sources of ionization such as stellar x - rays , fuv photons and galactic cosmic rays are expected to ionize the disk surface layers , providing good coupling there  even though recent results suggest that cosmic rays may be highly attenuated by the stellar wind @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , deep within the disk the evolution should be controlled by the non - ideal effects .",
    "the recognition of this led @xcite to propose what has now become the traditional dead - zone model in which the disk surface layers accrete by sustaining mri turbulence , with the shielded interior maintaining an inert and magnetically decoupled `` dead zone '' , where the mri is quenched by the action of ohmic resistivity only .",
    "the potential importance of the other non - ideal effects has long been recognized ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it is only recently that nonlinear shearing box simulations including ambipolar diffusion and the hall term have been performed in relevant parameter regimes , leading to a modified picture of how disks accrete that deviates significantly from the traditional dead zone one",
    ".    generally speaking , it is expected that in disk regions between 1@xmath0 , ohmic resistivity will be dominant near the midplane , the hall effect will be dominant at intermediate disk heights and ambipolar diffusion will be most important in low density regions higher up in the disk @xcite .",
    "the highest altitude surface layers are expected to be ionized by stellar fuv photons , and as such will evolve in the ideal mhd limit @xcite .",
    "shearing box simulations presented by @xcite that include ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion for models computed at @xmath5 demonstrate that ad quenches mri turbulence .",
    "they conclude that disks will be completely laminar between 1@xmath0 with angular momentum transport occurring because a magnetocentrifugal wind is launched from near the disk surface . for reasonable assumptions about the magnetic field strength and geometry ,",
    "accretion rates in agreement with the observations are obtained .",
    "the inclusion of the hall term in the presence of a vertical magnetic field introduces dichotomous behavior , arising from the fact that the coupled dynamics depends on the sign of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 signify the disk angular momentum vector and the ambient magnetic field direction , respectively .",
    "shearing box simulations presented by and @xcite show that when @xmath9 , the hall effect leads to the amplification of the horizontal magnetic fields within approximately two scale heights of the disk midplane , and the generation of a large scale maxwell stress through magnetic braking .",
    "in addition , the magnetocentrifugally driven wind is also seen to strengthen . when @xmath10 , however , magnetic stresses and winds are seen to weaken relative to the opposite case , and relative to the evolution",
    "observed when hall effects are neglected .",
    "quite how this _ hall dichotomy _ maps onto observations of ppds remains an open question .",
    "the internal dynamics of protoplanetary disks in the region 1@xmath0 are clearly of great significance for planet formation .",
    "the growth and settling of grains depends on the level of turbulence , with a laminar disk or one displaying weak turbulence providing the most favorable conditions  although it should be noted that some turbulent mixing is required to maintain a population of small grains in the surface regions of ppds so that their spectral energy distribution can be reproduced by radiative transfer models .",
    "the collisional growth of planetesimals has been shown to be affected strongly by the level of turbulence @xcite , and the migration of low mass planets is also highly sensitive to the presence or otherwise of turbulence , with significant stress levels being required to unsaturate corotation torques .",
    "this paper is the latest in a series in which we are exploring the influence of magnetic fields and non ideal mhd effects on the formation of planets , with the eventual goal of producing comprehensive models of ppds that will be used to study planet building and evolution . in earlier work @xcite",
    "we have used a combination of global and shearing box simulations to examine the dynamical evolution of dust grains , boulders and planetesimals in turbulent disks , with and without dead zones .",
    "more recently , we have studied the influence of magnetic fields on gap formation and gas accretion onto a forming giant planet using global simulations that also included ohmic resistivity @xcite . in this paper , we include both ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion in global disk simulations , and follow the dynamical evolution of the resulting disk models as a precursor to examining how ambipolar diffusion affects gas accretion onto a giant planet . of particular interest",
    "is the nature of the accretion flow in the disk , the nature of any magnetocentrifugal wind that is launched , and how these vary as a function of small changes in model parameters .",
    "these are the first quasi - global simulations to be conducted of ppds that are threaded by vertical magnetic fields and which include this combination of non ideal mhd effects , and as such are most comparable with the shearing box simulations presented by @xcite , hereafter . a fundamental question raised by the shearing box simulations is whether or not a physical wind solution with the correct field geometry emerges spontaneously in global disk simulations in a way that is not generally observed in shearing boxes because of their radial symmetry .",
    "probably the most important result contained in this paper is that physical wind solutions do indeed arise spontaneously in our global simulations , demonstrating the robustness of many of the features obtained in the shearing box simulations of .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : meth ] we describe the numerical method , the disk model , as well as the ionization chemistry .",
    "our results are presented in section  [ sec : res ] , where we mainly focus on the emerging wind solutions and the dynamical stability and evolution of forming current layers . in section  [ sec : corona ] , we will moreover report an instability that is driven by the sharp transition into the fuv dominated layer , and in section  [ sec:3d ] we assess whether secondary instabilities can drive non - axisymmetric evolution .",
    "we summarize our results in section  [ sec : summary ] and discuss implications for planet formation theory in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we present magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of protoplanetary accretion disks employing 2d axisymmetric and 3d uniformly - spaced spherical - polar meshes . in the following ,",
    "the coordinates @xmath11 denote spherical radius , co - latitude and azimuth , respectively .",
    "we moreover ignore explicit factors of the magnetic permeability @xmath12 in our notation .",
    "simulations were run using the single - fluid nirvana - iiicode , which implements a second - order - accurate godunov scheme @xcite .",
    "the code is formulated on orthogonal curvilinear meshes @xcite and employs the constrained transport method @xcite to maintain the divergence - free constraint of the magnetic field . as an alteration to the publicly available distribution of the code",
    ", we here adopt the upwind reconstruction technique of @xcite to obtain the edge - centered electric field components needed for the magnetic field update ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "this modification became necessary to take advantage of the more accurate hlld approximate riemann solver of @xcite , which offers advanced numerical accuracy for flows in the subsonic regime .",
    "our numerical model is based on solving the standard resistive mhd equations including ohmic resistivity as well as an electromotive force resulting from the mutual collision of ions and neutrals .",
    "given the typical number densities within ppds , the applicability of the strong - coupling approximation is warranted by detailed chemical modeling @xcite .",
    "accordingly the gas dynamics can be modeled by a single - fluid representing the motion of the neutral species , and the additional term can simply be evolved in a time - explicit fashion @xcite .",

    "the gravitational potential @xmath22 is a simple point - mass potential of a solar - mass star .",
    "we moreover obtain the gas pressure as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is appropriate for a diatomic molecular gas . the source term @xmath25 , mimicking radiative heating and cooling ,",
    "is included to relax the specific thermal energy density @xmath26 to its initial radial temperature profile .",
    "the relaxation is done on a fraction of the local dynamical time scale , which is short enough to avoid strong deviations from the equilibrium model but long enough to suppress vertical corrugation of the disk due to the goldreich - schubert - fricke instability ( see * ? ? ? * for a detailed study of this phenomenon ) .",
    "we remark that , while this instability is physical in nature , its appearance may be exaggerated in a strictly isothermal simulation , and more realistic modeling including radiative transfer should be employed to study its relevance .    because we use a time - explicit method , large peak values in the dissipation",
    "coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28 impose severe constraints on the numerically permissible integration time step .",
    "we address this by using a state - of - the - art second order super - time - stepping scheme recently proposed by @xcite . in comparison with conventional first - order methods , this runge - kutta - legendre scheme is free of adjustable parameters and has been proven superior in terms of both accuracy and robustness . to maintain the second - order accuracy of our time integration , we use strang - splitting for the diffusive terms .    in our previous local simulations ( cf .",

    "* ) , we have found that applying a constant cap on @xmath27 can _ qualitatively _ change the way in which the top and bottom disk layers are coupled to each other . for a typical wind configuration ,",
    "the horizontal field components generally change sign at the midplane .",
    "we imagine that in this situation a clipped @xmath27 would affect the amount of field diffusing into the midplane region and conversely the strength of the current sheets above and below the magnetically decoupled layer .",
    "we therefore choose not to apply a cap on @xmath27 .",
    "however , we limit @xmath28 such that @xmath29 ( also see ) , where @xmath30 is the plasma parameter , and @xmath31 is the equivalent of a magnetic reynolds number for ad .",
    "this we find greatly reduces the numerical cost without noticeably altering the obtained solution .",
    "the ohmic and ambipolar diffusivities are evaluated dynamically for each grid - cell and are based on a precomputed look - up table , that has been derived self - consistently from a detailed chemical model accounting for grain - charging and gas - phase chemistry .",
    "the ionization rates that enter this equilibrium chemistry are governed by ionizing radiation entering the disk .",
    "the column densities that govern the attenuation of the external ionizing radiation are also computed on - the - fly , that is , they reflect the instantaneous state of the disc . in principle , this allows for a self - limiting of the emerging wind via shielding of ionizing radiation @xcite .",
    "in addition to some minor modifications to the grain charging prescription ( as detailed below ) , we have improved the realism of our ionization model compared to our previous work .",
    "the main alterations concern the inclusion of two additional radiation sources , an un - scattered direct x - ray component , and hard uv photons .",
    "these have in common a shallow penetration depth but comparatively high flux levels , thus mainly affecting the ionization level of the disk s surface layers .",
    "adopting a very simple prescription based on the recent study by @xcite , we have added the effect of an fuv ionization layer based on an assumed ionization fraction of @xmath32 ( representing full ionization of the gas - phase carbon and sulfur atoms susceptible to losing electrons when struck by fuv photons ) , and a collision rate coefficient of @xmath33 .",
    "we further assume that fuv photons penetrate to a gas column density of @xmath34 . due to their lower amplitude",

    "note that this deviates from the local simulations of , where the vertical gas column was used for attenuation of the incident flux .",

    "the implications of this figure for our simulations are discussed in sect  [ sec : prelim ] .",
    "the region with @xmath52 , where the plasma parameter becomes constant with height is caused by applying a lower limit on the gas density to avoid excessive alfvn speeds in the disk halo .",
    "following , we chose this limit at @xmath53 ( in our global model , this value is with respect to the initial midplane value at any given cylindrical radius ) .",
    "we remark that the equilibrium density profile is artificially steep in our isothermal disk model with temperature constant on cylinders . in this respect ,",
    "the density floor acts to mimic a disk with realistic radiation thermodynamics , where the irradiation heating of the upper disk layers naturally creates an increased pressure scale height and hence a much shallower density profile .",
    "because @xmath54 ( and hence @xmath55 ) depends on the magnetization of the plasma , the actual density profile in the disk halo has an influence on how well the gas is coupled to the magnetic field lines , which in turn affects the efficiency of the magneto - centrifugal wind launching mechanism .",
    "this caveat should be kept in mind when interpreting the mass loading of the wind , which we expect to be a function of the thermodynamics in real protoplanetary disks .",

    "for the two non - axisymmetric simulations , the azimuthal extent is restricted to @xmath83 $ ] , with @xmath84 ( a quarter wedge ) , or @xmath85 to limit the computational expense .",
    "we furthermore note that in the ideal - mhd case , where turbulence develops , the azimuthal domain size has been found to have an effect on the final saturated state@xcite , at least for the case of zero net flux .",
    "because our ionization model depends on real physical values of the gas column density , we have to chose a meaningful normalization factor @xmath86 , which we fix according to a surface density of @xmath87 at the location @xmath88 , compatible with the typical minimum - mass solar nebula ( mmns * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in physical units ,",
    "the disk temperature is @xmath89 at a radius of @xmath90 , and @xmath91 at @xmath0 , resembling typical expected conditions within the protosolar disk .",
    "while our values for @xmath13 , @xmath56 and @xmath92 are similar to the mmsn values at @xmath0 , our adoption of different values for the radial power - law indices means that these values are different at @xmath5 compared to those adopted by .",

    "this type is a combination of a zero - gradient condition in the case of @xmath101 ( where @xmath102 denotes the outward - pointing normal vector ) , and reflective bcs in the opposite case , thus preventing inflow of material from outside the domain . at the upper and lower boundaries ( that is , in the @xmath103 direction )",
    ", we furthermore balance the ghost zone values such that a hydrostatic equilibrium is obtained .",
    "this helps to control artificial jumps of the fluid variables adjacent to the domain boundary as they are frequently encountered with finite - volume schemes .",
    "in contrast to our earlier global simulations of layered accretion disks subject to ohmic resistivity and containing an embedded gas - giant planet @xcite , we here make a different choice for the vertical magnetic - field boundary condition . whereas we previously applied magnetic bcs of the _ perfect conductor _ type ( that is , forcing the normal field component to zero and allowing non - zero parallel field )",
    ", we here use _ pseudo vacuum _ conditions , conversely enforcing the perturbed parallel field to vanish at the surface and only allowing a perpendicular perturbed field .",
    "note that we exclude the initial net - vertical field from the procedure such that only deviations from the background field are subject to the normal - field condition .",
    "the vertical flux threading the disk is thus preserved .",
    "since the disk s upper layers are magnetically dominated , and the lorentz force acts to align the flow lines with the magnetic field , letting the field lines cross the domain boundary is of course a prerequisite for launching an outflow .",
    "while we realize that forcing the radial and azimuthal components of the perturbed field to vanish at the boundary may unduly restrict the magnetic topology of the emerging wind solution , we postpone the study of less - restrictive but more cumbersome boundaries to future work .    unlike in a radially - periodic local shearing - box simulation , our global model",
    "is critically affected by the inner radial boundary condition . in a real protoplanetary disk",
    ", we can expect that alkali metals will be thermally ionized in this region , leading to the development of the mri on timescales short compared with the orbital timescale at the inner domain boundary of our model .",
    "this poses the question how to best interface the mri - turbulent inner disk with the magnetically decoupled midplane of the outer disk that we model .",
    "it is likely that mri - generated fields can efficiently leak into the outer disk via magnetic diffusion . in a first attempt to account for the mri - active inner disk",
    ", we gradually taper the diffusivity coefficients to zero within the inner @xmath104 of our disk model .",
    "studying the inner edge of the dead zone will however require dedicated simulations including this transition region .",

    "the configurations observed at late times are moreover found to remain quasi - stationary , at least during the evolution time of @xmath105 that we have investigated .",
    "perhaps the most noteworthy result from run oa - b5 is the spontaneous emergence of the expected `` hourglass '' geometry for the magnetic field , allowing magnetic tension forces to accelerate the wind .",
    "for the adopted vertical field polarity , the field must bend radially outward near the upper and lower disk surfaces , and the azimuthal field should point in the positive direction in the lower hemisphere and reverse direction above the midplane , as observed in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : vis2d_oa - b5 ] .",

    "the exact reason for this abrupt transition is unclear , since most characteristic quantities , such as the elsasser numbers @xmath146 , and @xmath55 , only depend weakly and continuously on radius",
    ". the most likely explanation may be the radial variation of the azimuthal field ( inside the `` undead '' belts ) , which drops in strength around this radial location .",
    "this is accompanied by a weakening and widening of the current layer , and a significant reduction in the inflow velocity of the radial accretion flow associated with the current layer , and a corresponding reduction in the shear relative to the background fluid .",

    "this is unsurprising , since the reduced cross - section for recombination on grains affects the ionization fraction significantly only at large gas columns ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : elsa ] ) , below the base of the wind .",
    "the grains are less important for the ionization state in the fuv layer , where the electrons are so abundant that many remain free once the grains charge to the coulomb limit @xcite .",
    "in contrast to our fiducial model , the transition between the base of the wind and the ohmic - dominated disk interior is very chaotic in model oa - b5-d4 , whereas it is much more stable in model oa - b5 .",
    "it appears that the larger values of @xmath146 and @xmath149 in this model at heights @xmath150 allow the channel modes to grow further into the nonlinear regime , such that parasitic modes are able to develop and cause the field belts to break up into regions with locally coherent field .",
    "the field amplification during this phase means ambipolar diffusion strengthens , as in run oa - b5 . eventually the local evolution is driven by a combination of field winding and diffusion .",

    "we have tested the robustness of the wind solution by running multiple simulations with modified initial conditions . because of the outward pressure force from the initial @xmath93 , and the vertical differential rotation , we generally obtain magnetic fields that point outwards in the radial direction in both hemispheres , as required for a physical wind solution that extracts angular momentum from the disk .",

    "these are found to have field polarities that may be aligned or anti - aligned with the background field associated with the wind , affecting the number of current layers that arise in the disk because of local field reversals .",

    "the associated wind stress is sufficient to drive an accretion flow that matches typical rates measured to be reaching the surfaces of young stars .    unlike earlier studies of magnetocentrifugal wind launching from deeper towards the midplane @xcite ,",
    "there is no requirement for a strong magnetic field to be present in the disk when the wind is launched from high altitudes , since the requirements for field rigidity are met for globally weak fields in these low density regions .",
    "the appearance of long - lived horizontal field belts is not observed in the shearing box simulations of , but this is because of modest differences in the disk models and assumed ionization physics ( their model has a somewhat larger surface density at @xmath5 , and we include a direct component to the disk illumination by stellar x - ray and fuv photons ) .",
    "the models agree qualitatively on the appearance of strong current layers , but the stability of these could not be examined by as their models in which the field geometry gave rise to these current layers used a quasi-1d approximation .",
    "this latter point illustrates the primary difference between the global and local shearing box simulations .",
    "the global simulations appear to produce and sustain the correct physical wind geometry spontaneously , whereas the symmetries associated with the shearing box normally lead to a radial magnetic field that points inwards in one hemisphere and outwards in the other , such that the correct geometry needs to be enforced .",
    "the potential role of the rather arbitrary initial conditions , and the vertical boundaries in setting the magnetic field topology in global models should be investigated .",
    "our choice to impose a vertical field is motivated by the typical `` hourglass '' morphology ( e.g. figures  2 and 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) emerging also in zoom - in simulations of ppd formation @xcite , and observed in molecular cores @xcite ; even though the topologies of ppds magnetic fields have not yet been unambiguously determined @xcite .",
    "the results presented in this paper , combined with those by , indicate that the traditional picture of a ppd hosting a dead zone in the shielded disk interior , with turbulent surface layers driven by the mri , no longer holds . when ambipolar diffusion is treated , the flow becomes laminar , and accretion is driven by the magnetic",
    "stresses produced in launching a wind from the disk surface . adding the hall effect appears to further modify the flow by allowing a significant maxwell stress to develop near the disk midplane through the combined action of field winding and hall drift , but does not lead to turbulence .",
    "we are then left with a picture of ppds in which the innermost regions sustain vigorous mri - induced turbulence because of collisional ionization of alkali metals , the intermediate regions between @xmath164 are laminar with angular momentum transport occurring through a disk wind and perhaps through maxwell stresses near the midplane ( an effect that only arises if @xmath165 and when including the hall term ) , and an outer region where the hall effect and ohmic resistivity are sub - dominant and weak turbulence arises @xcite .",
    "the picture painted above has important implications for dust evolution and planet formation . in principle ,",
    "dust coagulation and settling in the laminar region should occur rapidly , and in the absence of a source of stirring the loss of small grains should affect the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "this was examined by , who showed that this rapid evolution of the sed is not in agreement with observations , and for many years this important result has provided indirect evidence for the existence of turbulent stirring in the planet forming regions of protoplanetary disks . in the absence of a magnetic origin for local turbulence",
    "this suggests that either another source of turbulence exists , such as the vertical shear instability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or that small grains are continuously delivered to the laminar region from the outer and/or inner turbulent regions .",
    "the results in this paper are consistent with the remanent magnetic field measurements in chondrules by @xcite in that the minimum midplane field strength for a wind driven disk at the presumed chondrule forming location ( the midplane at @xmath166  to  @xmath167 ) we find is smaller than the upper bound on the ambient field strength in the chondrule cooling region found in that work .",
    "this allows the chondrules studied by @xcite to have formed in the midplane of a wind driven laminar disk , while also allowing for the chondrule formation process to locally concentrate the magnetic field .",
    "the influence of the traditional dead - zone picture for protoplanetary disks during various stages in planet formation has been examined in some detail . for example",
    ", @xcite showed that the stirring of planetesimals by the propagation of waves from the active region into the dead zone can stir up small planetesimals ( @xmath168 ) and cause them to undergo collisional destruction , or prevent their runaway growth . in recent work ( nelson et al .",
    "2014 , in prep . )",
    ", it has furthermore been shown that low mass planets orbiting in disk models with traditional dead zones are likely to undergo very rapid inward migration because the weak stresses there are unable to prevent saturation of the corotation torque . in principle",
    ", the new emerging picture of ppds  that is , assuming that maxwell stresses operate near the midplane because of the hall effect  can ameliorate these problems by removing the turbulent stirring , and by providing a significant stress that can prevent corotation torque saturation .",
    "full simulations are clearly required to examine whether or not the latter effect can be realized during full nonlinear evolution . finally , @xcite examined gap formation and gas accretion onto a giant planet within a disk with a traditional dead zone , and observed that the gas in the gap region became enlivened because of enhanced penetration of x - rays and cosmic rays .",
    "this created a turbulent and chaotic gas flow into the planet hill sphere , and the enhanced magnetic coupling also led to the launching of a magnetocentrifugally accelerated jet from the circumplanetary disk .",
    "it remains unclear whether or not these effects will arise when ambipolar diffusion is included , given the low density of the gap region .",
    "we thank martin pessah , anna tenerani and marco velli for useful advice on plasma instabilities , and the referee for a helpful report .",
