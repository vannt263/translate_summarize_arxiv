    "the heavy - light mesons play an important role in hadron physics . during the past several years , many heavy - light mesons were observed in experiments . in the particle data group ( pdg ) table @xcite ,",
    "there are four @xmath25-wave charm states @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and two @xmath25-wave bottom states @xmath30 , @xmath31 . for the @xmath25-wave bottom - strange states , @xmath2 and @xmath32",
    "are observed by the cdf collaboration in 2008 @xcite .",
    "later the d0 collaboration also reported @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "meanwhile d0 collaboration indicated that @xmath2 was not observed with the available data set .    in the heavy quark effective theory(hqet ) @xcite , for the heavy - light meson system",

    "@xmath31 also belong to @xmath53 @xmath43 doublet ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the observations of these @xmath25-wave mesons inspire our interest in their nature .",
    "there are many theoretical approaches are used to study their properties @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the productions of @xmath25-wave charm states , bottom states and bottom - strange states in exclusive semileptonic and nonleptonic @xmath55 decays .    since the discovery of @xmath56 @xcite , the heavy - light orbitally excited states stimulated continued interesting attentions .",
    "there are some special characters of these excited states , for example , the mass of @xmath56 is much smaller than the prediction of the relativistic quark model @xcite which has been very successful , and it has a narrow decay width . though it is believed to be the orbitally excited state of @xmath57 by most of the physicists now , there have been some arguments about its nature .",
    "it can be a conventional @xmath58 state @xcite , four - quark state @xcite , or molecular state since it is just above the threshold of @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xcite , @xmath61 .",
    "in the family of excited heavy - light states in the conventional quark model , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the orbitally excited states of @xmath62 and they are the @xmath63 system .",
    "we know little about them since only two candidates of them are observed in experiments .",
    "the cdf collaboration reported their observations , @xmath2 with mass @xmath64 mev and @xmath3 with mass @xmath65 mev in 2008 @xcite .",
    "later the d0 collaboration confirmed the existence of @xmath66 with mass @xmath67 mev and indicated that @xmath46 was not observed with available data @xcite .",
    "different from the lack of data in experiments , there are a lot of theoretical efforts to investigate the properties of the @xmath24 system . for example , the mass spectroscopy had been estimated by the model of hqet @xcite , relativistic constituent quark models @xcite and lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "the strong decays of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are also studied by many authors , these studies helped us not only to find another two states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , but also to estimate the full decay widths of these @xmath24 states .",
    "there are large discrepancies between the existing results of the different models , which are shown in the section of numerical results .",
    "more careful study is needed , especially in the relativistic models , because the relativistic corrections are large for excited states . in this letter",
    ", we will study the strong decays of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 by the improved bethe - salpeter(b - s ) approach which is a relativistic method based on a relativistic four - dimensional wave equation @xcite . in this model , the @xmath24",
    "are bound states composed of quark @xmath68 and anti - quark @xmath69 , with an angular momentum @xmath45 , so they are orbitally excited states and also called @xmath25 wave states . the quantum numbers @xmath70 of these @xmath25 wave states are @xmath71 ( @xmath0 ) , @xmath72 ( @xmath1 ) , @xmath72 ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath73 ( @xmath3 ) , the allowed strong decay modes are @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , while other strong decays of @xmath25 wave in the final state are ruled out by the kinematic possible mass region . for the same reason",
    ", we have checked that in the final states of the allowed strong decays the pseudoscalar @xmath78 state must be the light meson ( @xmath79 ) , and the other one is a heavy meson ( @xmath80 ) . using the reduction formula , pcac relation and low energy theorem",
    ", we got the strong decay amplitude @xcite , which is a function of the transition matrix element between two heavy mesons .",
    "we will adopt this method to calculate the transition matrix element by the improved b - s method in this letter .",
    "similar to the @xmath58 system , the @xmath81 ( or @xmath82 ) system is the bound state composed of a heavy quark and a light quark . since the heavy quark @xmath69 is much heavier than the light quark @xmath68 , the heavy - light mesons can be characterized by the spin of heavy quark @xmath83 , the total angular momentum of light quark @xmath84 , and the total angular momentum @xmath85 . for @xmath38 , the @xmath86 @xmath36 doublet ,",
    "there are two states with @xmath87 ; for @xmath45 , there are two degenerate doublets : @xmath88 @xmath40 doublet and @xmath89 @xmath43 doublet , with the corresponding quantum numbers @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",

    "obviously , there are two @xmath72 states : @xmath1 and @xmath46 , we use the notations @xmath92 and @xmath93 to describe them respectively .",
    "recently , we have resolved the instantaneous bethe - salpeter equation , which is also called salpeter equation , and obtained numerical relativistic wave functions for different @xmath94 states @xcite .",
    "we also give an improved formula of the transition matrix element which is based on the mandelstam formulism and the relativistic salpeter wave functions .",
    "the corresponding transition matrix element is valid for any recoil momentum whenever it is large or small , and we have proven that this transition matrix element is gauge invariant when it is necessary @xcite . so in this letter , we will use the improved b - s method to calculate the strong decays of the orbitally excited heavy - light states @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . according to the estimated masses",
    "theoretically , @xmath0 and @xmath1 have small masses , we calculate the isospin symmetry violating decay processes @xmath6 and @xmath95 through @xmath8 mixing and get small widths . considering the uncertainties of the masses , for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we also calculate the strong decay channels : @xmath96 and @xmath10 . for @xmath2 and @xmath3 ,",

    "in order to obtain the masses and wave functions of initial and final states , which are used to calculate the transition matrix elements and decay widths , we solve the instantaneous b - s equation @xcite , and the parameters are chosen as : @xmath334 gev@xmath333 , @xmath335 gev , @xmath336 gev , @xmath337 gev , @xmath338 gev , @xmath339 gev , @xmath340 gev and @xmath140 for the b - s kernel as same as refs .",
    "the numerical values of these parameters are obtained by fitting data , for examples : @xmath341 gev , @xmath342 gev , @xmath343 gev , @xmath344 gev , @xmath345 gev , @xmath346 gev @xcite .",
    "with this set of parameters , and varying all the input parameters simultaneously within @xmath347 of the central values , we obtain the light doublet masses : @xmath348 the other input parameters in this letter are the masses of light mesons : @xmath349 gev , @xmath350 gev , @xmath351 gev , and the decay constants @xmath352 mev , @xmath353 mev @xcite .    with these parameters ,",
    "we solve the instantaneous salpeter equations for different states , and obtain the masses and relativistic wave functions .",
    "we calculate the transition matrix elements by the wave functions numerically , and get the strong coupling constants : @xmath354    considering the uncertainties of the masses , for mesons @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the upper limits of the masses are @xmath355 gev and @xmath356 gev , which are above the threshold of @xmath357 , @xmath358 , so with these upper limit values of masses , we also calculated the ozi allowed channels : @xmath359 the corresponding decay widths are shown in table  i.    .the strong decay widths of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in units of mev . here",
    "we only calculated the cases that the upper limit values of masses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are chosen , and we take @xmath360 . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table .",
    "i , ii , iii and iv , we show numerical results of strong decay widths , which are predicted by us and other authors . for @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "our results are consistent with the ones presented by references @xcite and @xcite , close to the results of reference @xcite , but much larger than the ones of @xcite , and much smaller than the predictions of @xcite .",
    "though the predicted masses of the @xmath25-wave @xmath50 states are similar for different models , the predicted decay widths are much different .",
    "the situation is similar in other channels .",
    "for example , our prediction of @xmath97 is close to the result of reference @xcite , and we get the narrowest decay width .    in our calculation , we choose a small value of mixing parameter , @xmath332 gev@xmath333 , which suppresses the corresponding decay widths much heavily , the decay widths are very small . considering the uncertainties of the masses , the decay widths of the ozi allowed decay channels : @xmath9 , @xmath361 are larger than the results of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "this is because that the @xmath40 doublet states ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) decay through @xmath40 wave , they usually have broader decay widths , while the @xmath43 doublet states ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) decay through @xmath362 wave , they usually have narrower widths , though the decay channels are ozi rule allowed ones .",
    "the large discrepancies between the results of different models may be caused by the small phase space of transition channels , and the results are very sensitive to the masses of corresponding mesons .",
    "we take into account the errors by varying all the input parameters simultaneously within @xmath347 of the central values .",
    "one can see that in table .",
    "ii , we get relatively large errors even we change the parameters in such small regions . in table .",
    "iii and iv , the phase spaces of the decays of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are too narrow , the decay widths depend heavily upon the masses of initial mesons .",
    "if we change the masses of initial mesons , there will be large errors , even one order larger than the original value .",
    "so we change all the input parameters except the masses of initial mesons which are fixed to the experimental data to calculate the errors for @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    in conclusion , through the improved b - s method",
    ", we predict the masses of the orbitally excited states @xmath0 and @xmath1 , calculate the strong coupling constants @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath363 , @xmath364 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and obtain the strong decay widths of @xmath6 , @xmath9 , @xmath7 , @xmath10 , @xmath97 , @xmath12 and @xmath365 , which are useful to find the unobserved states and to estimate the full decay widths of these orbitally excited states .",
