    "the study of the evolution of self - gravitating systems ( even in the spherically symmetric case ) requires the use of numerical procedures and/or the introduction of simplifying assumptions .",
    "the former usually lead to model dependent conclusions and the later are frequently too restrictive and/or deprived of physical justification .",
    "an alternative path to this question consists in perturbing the system , compeling it to withdraw from equilibrium state . evaluating it after its departure from equilibrium",
    ", it is possible to study the tendency of the evolution of the object .",
    "this is usually done following a first order perturbative method which neglects cuadratic and higher terms in the perturbed quantities .",
    "if the relevant processes occuring in the self - gravitating object take place on time scales which are of the order of , or smaller than , hydrostatic time scale , then the quasistatic approximation fails ( e.g. during the quick collapse phase preceding neutron star formation ) . in this case",
    "it is necessary to evaluate the system immediately after its departure from equilibrium , where _ immediately _ means on a time scale of the order of relaxation times .",
    "this approach has proven to be useful in the dissipationless case @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it has been recently found @xcite that for non - viscous dissipative case this approach can not always be applied . in particular , the goodness of the first order perturbation method can be examined by means of the value of the local parameter @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the thermal conductivity , @xmath2 is the temperature , @xmath3 is the relaxation time for thermal signals and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the energy density and the radial pressure respectively . if @xmath6 then it has been shown that @xcite the effective inertial mass density of a fluid element vanishes and becomes negative if @xmath7 .",
    "the point for which the system reaches condition @xmath6 is called the _",
    "critical point_. this strange behaviour of matter , at , and beyond the critical point might suggest that first order perturbation method fails under such conditions . in some cases , systems with a value of @xmath8 close to , or beyond ,",
    "the critical point are forbidden by causality conditions , but this is not always true .",
    "the existence of this critical point seems to take a special relevance for the last ones .",
    "efectively , if causality conditions do not forbid the critical point , then there can exist systems that can not be studied using a first order perturbation method .",
    "furthermore , causality conditions @xcite have been found by means of a perturbative method up to first order in the perturbed quantities .",
    "thus , for such systems , causality conditions must be taken with care .",
    "the aim of this paper is to elucidate the existence of a similar critical point in dissipative viscous systems . to do this",
    "we shall assume that , initially , the system is either static or slowly evolving along a sequence of states in which it is not only in hydrostatic equilibrium , but also thermally adjusted .",
    "then , we shall perturb the dissipative flows and radial velocity ( as seen by a minkowskian observer ) . as it has been mentioned above",
    ", the system must be evaluated on a time scale of the order of relaxation times after the perturbation takes place .",
    "thus , the properties of the system are still the same , and only time derivatives of perturbed quantities have changed appreciably , but not the quantities themselves .    in order to find the critical point we shall use the transport equations for the dissipative flows and the radial momentum conservation equation .",
    "the eckart - landau transport equations @xcite imply a vanishing relaxation time for dissipative flows .",
    "the adoption of these equations is not advisable here for two reasons : first , they predict an infinite speed for thermal and viscous signals propagation and unstable equilibrium states @xcite .",
    "second , we are evaluating the system immediately after perturbation ( in the sense described above ) .",
    "thus , to be consisten with this choice we must use transport equations with non vanishing relaxation times . in this work ,",
    "transport equations are introduced using the mller - israel - stewart second order phenomenological theory for dissipative fluids @xcite .",
    "after the condition for the critical point is found we contrast stability and causality conditions with this one .",
    "we shall see that , in some cases , the critical point may be reached without violating causality conditions and , as it has been mentioned above , causality conditions must be used with caution .",
    "finally , we show that neutrino trapping during gravitational collapse @xcite can lead to values of @xmath8 beyond the critical point .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "the field equations , the conventions , and other useful formulae are introduced . in section 3",
    "we briefly present transport equations . in section 4",
    "the full system of equations is evaluated at the time when the object starts to depart from equilibrium finding the expression for the critical point .",
    "finally , a discussion of the reliability of stability and causality conditions is given in the last section .",
    "we adopt metrics of signature -2 and geometrised units @xmath9 throughout the text ( except in the example preesented in last section ) .",
    "the quantities subscripted with @xmath10 denote that they are evaluated at the surface of the sphere .",

    "we assume that , before perturbation , the system is slowly evolving along a sequence of states in which it is close to hydrostatic equilibrium and thermally adjusted - the so called _ complete equilibrium _ .",

    "this condition will be accomplished for small values of luminosity @xmath139 , and consequently for small values of @xmath140 thus , before perturbation , we can assume @xmath141 in the whole system .",

    "we shall evaluate the system immediately after perturbation ( in the sense described in the introduction ) .",
    "physically , this implies that the perturbed quantities ( @xmath149 @xmath150 @xmath56 and @xmath53 ) are still much less than unity .",
    "nevertheless , the system is departing form hydrostatic equilibrium and thermal adjustment .",
    "thus , the @xmath19-derivatives of the perturbed quantities are small but different from zero ( _ i.e. _ @xmath151 ) .    thus , our initially slowly evolving system is characterized by :    1 .   before perturbation @xmath152 2 .",
    "after perturbation @xmath153    in both cases we have @xmath154 @xmath155 the initially static case can also be considered .",
    "this system is characterized by :    1 .   before perturbation @xmath156 2 .",
    "after perturbation @xmath157    and @xmath158 let us now start by evaluating ( [ 21 ] ) .",
    "in the static case we obtain before perturbation @xmath159 and immediately after perturbation , neglecting terms of order @xmath160 and higher , @xmath161 for bulk viscous pressure equation , we obtain in the initially static case after perturbation @xmath162 expressions ( [ 47 ] ) and ( [ 48 ] ) are also obtained for the initially slowly evolving case applying ( [ 41 ] ) and ( [ 42 ] ) .",
    "the evaluation of the equation for the shear viscous pressure ( [ 23 ] ) yields , after perturbation , for both possible initial configurations @xmath163 thus , the three transport equations ( [ 21]-[23 ] ) , evaluated after perturbation , lead to expressions which are the same for the two initial configurations .    finally , let us evaluate conservation equation @xmath82 ( [ 16 ] ) after perturbation . in the initially static case , we have before perturbation condition ( [ 44bis ] ) .",

    "this one vanishes for @xmath180 , implying the vanishing of @xmath172 , even though the time derivative of the radial velocity is different from zero . as it has been mentioned in the introduction",

    "_ this one coincides with the given in @xcite if @xmath102 and @xmath103 are zero .    note that the effective inertial mass decreases as @xmath8 grows .",
    "as @xmath181 approaches to unity the system seems to be more unstable , and for @xmath182 a vanishingly small radial force leads to non zero values of @xmath183 this fact contradicts the assumption that the hydrostatic equilibrium corresponds to a vanishing total radial force , and consequently the reliability of a perturbative approach is in question under such condition .",
    "this approach also predicts an anomalous behaviour beyond the critical point . if @xmath184 then an outward force ( @xmath185 ) implies an inward acceleration ( @xmath186 ) .",
    "thus , we may conclude that we can neglect cuadratic and higher terms in the perturbed variables only if @xmath8 is not close to , or beyond , the critical point .",
    "causality and stability conditions @xcite have been found using a perturbative method up to first order .",
    "therefore , it seems interesting to answer to the following question .",
    "are systems with @xmath187 , or @xmath188 always forbidden by causality conditions ? if the answer is no , then the reliability of causality conditions is uncertain for such systems . in the next section",
    "we shall try to answer this question .",
    "in order to contrast the @xmath189 and @xmath7 conditions with stability and causality conditions , it is convenient to write ( [ 61 ] ) , using the notation adopted in @xcite . thus , @xmath190    according to linear perturbation theory @xcite , causality and stability requires @xmath191 @xmath192 and @xmath193 where @xmath194 the adiabatic contribution to the speed of sound is denoted by @xmath195 , @xmath196 is the particle number density , and @xmath197 , @xmath198 , and @xmath199 denote specific heat at constant volume , isothermal compressibility , and thermal expansion coefficient respectively .",
    "as usually , they are defined by @xmath200 @xmath201 and @xmath202    as we already mentioned , if the two viscosity coefficients vanishes , we recover the result found in @xcite . in this case it can be shown that the critical point is very close to the point where ( [ 63]-[65 ] ) break down @xcite for small values of @xmath203 .",
    "let us now consider the case where there is only bulk viscosity ( @xmath204 ) .",
    "in this case @xmath205 @xcite , and the critical point is overtaken if @xmath206 is satisfied , whereas causality requires @xmath207 therefore , it appears that the critical point is forbidden by causality and stability requirements .",
    "in the pure shear viscosity case ( @xmath208 ) , the critical point is overtaken if @xmath209 whereas the most restrictive causality condition , is given ( in this case ) by ( [ 63 ] ) @xmath210 again , the critical point is beyond the point where causality is violated .",
    "let us now consider the general case ( @xmath211 ) .",
    "we may write ( [ 63 ] ) as @xmath212 we are going to find conditions for which the point where causality is violated is beyond the critical point . assuming that our system is at , or beyond , the critical point ( @xmath213 )",
    ", then we should demand by virtue of ( [ 62 ] ) and ( [ 74 ] ) @xmath214 or , after some elementary algebra @xmath215 \\left ( \\frac 2{1+c_s^2}\\right ) ,   \\label{76}\\ ] ] and combining it with ( [ 65 ] ) @xmath216 \\left ( \\frac 2{1+c_s^2}\\right ) , \\label{77}\\ ] ] implying @xmath217 \\left ( \\frac 2{1+c_s^2}\\right ) > 0 ,   \\label{78}\\ ] ] which is equivalent to @xmath218 .",
    "\\label{79}\\ ] ] thus , if @xmath219 , it is , in principle , possible to attain the critical point without violating causality conditions ( [ 63 ] ) and ( [ 65 ] ) .",
    "note that condition ( [ 64 ] ) has not been used in this calculus , so it should be demanded in addition to condition @xmath219 .",
    "therefore , from ( [ 64 ] ) , ( [ 66 ] ) , and ( [ 79 ] ) , the critical point can be overtaken without violating causality conditions if the following conditions are satisfied @xmath220 note that conditions ( [ 79b ] ) and ( [ 79c ] ) do not imply necessarily @xmath221 , but if causality conditions and @xmath7 are accomplished , then conditions ( [ 79b ] ) and ( [ 79c ] ) must be fulfilled .",
    "an example of this situation is an ultrarelativistic monoatomic ideal gas ( @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 ) . for this fluid @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 @xmath230 and @xmath231",
    "then ( [ 79b ] ) and ( [ 79c ] ) are accomplished , but @xmath232 .    on the other hand if @xmath233 , then the critical point is less restrictive than ( [ 65 ] ) , and causality and stability conditions can be used freely .",
    "thus , we face the following alternatives :    1 .   in the case of pure bulk or shear viscosity ( without heat conduction ) , the critical point is well beyond the point where causality breaks down .",
    "therefore , the system should not reach the critical point in those cases , and linear approximation can be applied to find stability and causality conditions .",
    "2 .   in the non - viscous case",
    ", the critical point is very close to the point where causality is violated for small values of the sound speed .",
    "since the linear approximation is not reliable close to the critical point , then it might be possible for a given system to attain the critical point .",
    "3 .   in the general case",
    "it may happen than causality breaks down beyond the critical point .",
    "thus , it appear that there exist situations where a given physical system may attain the critical point and even go beyond it .",
    "it is worth noticing that condition @xmath7 can be accomplished in non very exotic systems .",
    "one of them is an interacting mixture of matter and neutrinos , which is a well - known scenario during the formation of a neutron star in a supernova explosion . in this case",
    "the heat conductivity coefficient is given by @xcite @xmath234 where @xmath3 is the mean collision time , @xmath235 , @xmath236 is the number in neutrino flavors and @xmath10 is the radiation constant .",
    "assuming that two viscosity coefficients vanishes , and @xmath237 then @xmath238 using usual units , the critical point is overtaken if @xmath239{\\frac{6\\rho c^3}{7n_\\nu a}}\\sim 4.29\\times 10 ^ 8\\rho ^{1/4 } , \\label{79f}\\ ] ] where we have adopted @xmath240 , @xmath241 , @xmath2 is in kelvin and @xmath4 is given in g @xmath242 the values of temperature , for which @xmath6 , are presented in figure 1 as a function of energy density .",
    "these ones are similar to the expected temperature that can be reached during hot collapse in a supernova explosion ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath243 18.6 ) .",
    "we would like to conclude with the following comment : for degenerate matter , when thermal conductivity is dominated by electrons , thermal relaxation time may be of the order of milliseconds ( or even larger ) , due to larger mean free path of electrons @xcite , but this is of the same order of magnitude as the time scale of the quick phase preceding neutron star formation .",
    "therefore for this last scenario ( at least ) , the basic assumption of our approach is justified .",
