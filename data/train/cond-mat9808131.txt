    "critical properties of many magnetic materials can be described by a simple ising model , h = k_<i , j > s_i s_j , [ ham ] where @xmath5 represents the spin of site @xmath6 , and the sum extends over nearest neigbours only .",
    "the factor @xmath7 is included in the coupling constant @xmath8 .",
    "the ising model has been solved exactly in one and two dimensions . however , for higher dimensions , there exist extensive perturbative analyses based on renormalization group methods and numerical investigations with monte carlo methods .",
    "it was traditionally believed that universal scaling behaviour exists only in or near thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "recently , it has been argued theoretically @xcite that some dynamic systems already exhibit universal scaling behaviour in the macroscopic short - time region of their dynamic evolution .",
    "the main point is that universality and scaling emerge after a microscopic time scale @xmath9 , which is sufficiently large in the microscopic sense but still short in the macroscopic sense .",
    "this statement has been proven valid in a series of numerical simulations of various statistical systems .",
    "more interestingly , as well as the new critical exponent @xmath0 , describing the critical initial increase of the magnetization , and the dynamic critical exponent @xmath1 , short - time critical dynamics provides a measure of the static critical exponents and of the critical temperature .",
    "this dynamic approach is free of critical slowing down since the spatial correlation length is still small within the short - time regime , even at or near the critical point .    up to now",
    ", systematic numerical simulations of the short - time critical dynamics have been carried out mainly in two - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "for the three - dimensional ising model , the power - law decay of the magnetization starting from an ordered state has been simulated @xcite , the new exponent @xmath0 and the dynamic exponent @xmath1 have also been obtained @xcite . however , a complete understanding of the short - time dynamic behaviour of the three - dimensional ising model is still necessary , since it is a very important model .",
    "especially , a systematic test of the short - time dynamic approach to the determination of all the critical exponents and the critical temperature in a three - dimensional system is important .    in this paper",
    "we report a comprehensive investigation of the short - time critical dynamics of the three - dimensional ising model .",
    "a power - law behaviour of the autocorrelation , the second moment and the binder cumulant is observed , in addition to that of the magnetization .",
    "the results support fully the short - time dynamic scaling . for the first time we extract the critical temperature and the static exponents @xmath2 and @xmath3 from the short - time scaling behaviour .",
    "our results for the static exponents and critical temperature agree well with those obtained in the extensive studies at thermodynamic equilibrium .    in the next section , a scaling analysis of the short - time critical dynamics is given .",

    "the last section contains the summary and discussion .",
    "using renormalization group methods , janssen , schaub and schmittmann @xcite have shown that far from equilibrium , in a macroscopic short - time regime of the dynamical evolution , there already emerges universal scaling behaviour in the @xmath10 vector model .",
