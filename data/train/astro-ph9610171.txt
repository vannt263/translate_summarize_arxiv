    "the turnover magnitude of the luminosity function of globular clusters in external galaxies has been used as a standard candle for distance measurements ( cf @xcite ) .",
    "the method is usually applied to elliptical galaxies with the calibration to the globular cluster system ( gcs ) in the local group .",
    "although it seems to be quite universal , the center of the luminosity function can be expected to differ from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "in fact , there is no consistent theoretical model that predicts the same mean mass or luminosity for the _ initial _ distribution of globular clusters ( but see @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "recent work by @xcite and @xcite ( 1996a , b ) , which built on less detailed analysis of @xcite and @xcite , demonstrated that the gcs in our galaxy suffers a substantial depletion over the hubble time due to a variety of dynamical processes , but primarily the tidal bulge and disk shocks and the enhanced evaporation of stars through the tidal density cutoff .",
    "these effects vary with distance to the galactic center and are most pronounced in the inner part . in this _",
    "letter _ we look for an observational evidence for the imprints of the dynamical effects and address the question of universality of the globular cluster luminosity function ( gclf ) .",
    "if the dynamical effects are important , the inner population should show a distribution different from that of the outer population that presumably has the initial form ( modulo internal two - body relaxation process ) . for our galaxy",
    "three - dimensional information is available , but for others only projected radii are known .",
    "therefore , the simplest approach is to divide the observed sample into two halves , inner and outer , according to the distance from the center of the galaxy .",
    "the gclf is conventionally fitted to a gaussian function in magnitude , @xmath2 .",
    "it provides a useful measure of the overall shape and the parameters ( @xmath3 ) of the gcs .",
    "we assume also that the two halves of the sample can be fit by the same function , but with different parameters .",
    "this allows us an easy way to compare the two populations . as an independent check that does not use the assumption of normal distribution",
    ", we compare the median points ( @xmath4 ) of the two populations .",
    "we use the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) as a prime tool to evaluate the parameters of the distribution and their uncertainties ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reviewed this method in detail and formulated the necessary corrections for the magnitude - limited data .",
    "we use their equations ( 10a10c ) to estimate the mean and dispersion of the sample as well as the normalization coefficient , all of which are allowed to vary .",
    "@xcite investigated a number of functional forms to be applied in the ml analysis of the gclf and found the student s @xmath5-distribution to be optimal . since the deviation in the inferred parameters as compared to the gaussian is small , we chose the latter as it is simpler and more commonly used . in most studies",
    "up to now the turnover point and the dispersion of the gclf were determined by fitting a gaussian to the histogram of the magnitude distribution .",
    "this method implies binning of the data and leads to a significant loss of information that becomes especially important in case of a small sample ( as in the milky way and m31 ) .",
    "we use it as a secondary estimator , mainly for consistency with the previous results .",
    "monte - carlo simulations were performed to establish the statistical significance of the differences of the inner and outer populations .",
    "the original sample was divided into two parts randomly , and for each such realization the differences of the means , @xmath6 , and of the medians , @xmath7 , were recorded .",
    "10,000 of the random realizations constitute a very nearly gaussian sample from which the probability of drawing a given @xmath6 or @xmath7 is calculated .",
    "the sample of the galactic globular clusters is best studied and essentially complete .",
    "we take the recent compilation by @xcite of 140 clusters with measured magnitudes and distances from the galactic center .",
    "sorted by the distance sample is divided into two equal parts at the boundary radius of @xmath8 kpc .",
    "note that @xcite used a similar division to separate the old and young halo clusters .",
    "the estimated parameters of the milky way gclf are given in table [ tab : mw ] .",
    "the mean of the whole distribution is at @xmath9 , in accord with secker s ( 1992 ) estimate of @xmath10 ( fitting the histogram , however , gives @xmath11 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the means of the two populations differ by almost 0.7 mag , and the medians by 0.33 mag , with the inner part being systematically brighter .",
    "the outer clusters also have much larger dispersion .",
    "the result is statistically significant as given by the monte - carlo probability of less than 0.5% ( table [ tab : mw ] ) that the observed @xmath6 occurs by chance .",
    "as expected , the dispersion of @xmath6 from the monte - carlo realizations is nearly the same as the mle of the standard error of @xmath6 .",
    "the difference in medians is smaller but nonetheless noticeable . we have checked that restriction of the sample to the halo clusters ( with [ fe / h ] @xmath12 ; @xcite ) changes all parameters by much less than their standard errors .",
    "the difference of the inner and outer populations is illustrated on figure [ fig : mw ] that shows histograms for the two subsamples and our fit obtained with the ml estimated parameters .",
    "fitting a gaussian directly to the histograms depends on the size of the bins .",
    "we found a slight variation within the errors of the two means obtained this way for a range of bin sizes , @xmath13 , from 0.3 to 0.5 mag .",
    "table [ tab : mw ] shows the results for @xmath14 mag which are consistent with the ml estimates .",
    "the dispersion of the outer sample is less well constrained ; note also the large standard error of its ml estimate .",
    "the difference of the means is reduced to 0.5 mag , but still is a two  sigma result .",
    "@xcite have recently undertaken a similar study and found no difference in the centers of the inner and outer populations of the halo clusters , though the dispersions were significantly different ( and close to our estimates ) . to facilitate a comparison with their results",
    ", we tried to match the sample they used as close as possible ; it was drawn from the database maintained by w. harris .",
    "the second half of table [ tab : mw ] shows that @xmath6 is still significant at 1.5sigma level when calculated using ml , but disappears when inferred from the histogram fitting . for the latter we used the same bin size ( 0.4 mag ) as @xcite .",
    "we doubt the trustiness of the latter estimate based on binning of already very small sample ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the lesser statistical significance of the ml estimator of @xmath6 in this case arises probably from the smaller size of the sample .",
    "the andromeda has more globular clusters than milky way , and the dust obscuration is less of a problem .",
    "we use the most recent compilation of the gcs in m31 by j .-",
    "perelmuter  with 1 cluster rejected on basis of its radial velocity ( the kinematic data were kindly provided by j. huchra ) .",
    "the sample becomes incomplete at @xmath16 , well beyond the peak of the distribution .",
    "we considered , therefore , two cuts of the original data at @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : m31 ] shows the histograms for the more conservative second cut .",
    "the centers of the two populations are clearly different with @xmath19 .",
    "the difference in dispersions is smaller than in milky way and is within the errors .",
    "the ml estimates agree very well with the histogram fitting results ( see table [ tab : m31 ] ) for both cuts of the sample .",
    "the inner population is consistently brighter than the outer with huge statistical significance ( 7-sigma for @xmath6 and 6-sigma for @xmath7 ) .",
    "thus there is little doubt that dynamical evolution left a strong imprint in the inner parts of the galaxy .",
    "relative closeness of m31 makes the completeness limit much better off than in m87 , so the result is essentially unaffected by the observational selection .",
    "the giant cd galaxy at the center of the virgo cluster possesses the largest sample of globular clusters observed around galaxies , although the completeness is a severe problem .",
    "the most recent data available to us is from @xcite .",
    "all sources have @xmath20 , and the completeness limit is about @xmath21 . along with the real clusters there could be a contamination from the foreground stars or background sources .",
    "we restricted the sample to a range of radii ( @xmath22 ) where the signal - to - noise ratio is greater than unity .",
    "figure [ fig : m87 ] shows the histograms for the sample cut at @xmath23 .",
    "the inner and outer populations have similar distributions but there is an apparent excess of the outer clusters at the faint end .",
    "also , the inner clusters prevail for @xmath24 ( but not in the very bright end ) .",
    "the mle of the difference of the means is @xmath25 ( table [ tab : m87 ] ) and is formally very significant .",
    "these standard errors should be taken with caution , however , as the systematic errors due to incompleteness of the data are likely to be larger .",
    "for example , the difference of the medians is only 0.16 mag .",
    "similar results are obtained when the sample is cut at @xmath26 , i.e. very close to the peak of the gclf . in both cases statistical corrections",
    "applied to ml estimates of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are important .",
    "therefore the results are somewhat sensitive to the completeness limits .",
    "a deeper sample is required for robust comparison of the inner and outer parts of the gcs .",
    "fitting the histograms becomes unstable because of the incompleteness .",
    "thus , even for the whole sample @xcite found that a broad range of @xmath27 and @xmath28 gives similar `` goodness '' ( @xmath29 ) of the fit .",
    "our fits give fainter central magnitudes and broader dispersions , but the scatter is very large .",
    "also , different parameters were obtained for different bin sizes .",
    "for this reason we consider the fits as unreliable .",
    "we investigated the differences of the inner and outer populations of globular clusters in milky way , m31 , and m87 .",
    "there is a considerable difference in the turnover magnitudes , @xmath30 , for the two close and more complete samples .",
    "monte - carlo simulations confirmed statistical significance of the result .",
    "an independent check is provided by using the medians instead of the means which is unaffected by the wings of the distribution .    in all three galaxies ,",
    "the inner cluster population has brighter mean magnitude and smaller dispersion .",
    "presumably , the differences arise due to dynamical processes operating most efficiently in the inner part of the galaxies .",
    "the sign of the observed effects is as expected for a depletion in the inner parts of the galaxies of low luminosity , low density clusters .",
    "we will investigate the dynamical interpretation of the results in a complementary study ( @xcite ) .",
