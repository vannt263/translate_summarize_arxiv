    "microscopic traps provide a powerful tool for the control and manipulation of bose - einstein condensates over micrometer distances .",
    "microstructured surfaces , known as atom chips , are particularly interesting for this purpose since they can be tailored to provide a variety of trapping geometries @xcite and promise well - controlled quantum state manipulations of neutral atoms in integrated and scalable microtrap arrays .",
    "ultimately there is the possibility of controlling the quantum coherences within arrays of individual atoms for use in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "this technology is attractive because it appears robust and scalable and because trapped neutral atoms can have long coherence times .",

    "thermal fluctuations give rise to johnson noise currents in the material @xcite .",
    "such currents are normally observed as a noise voltage across a resistor , but they also cause the electromagnetic field near a conducting solid to fluctuate with a broad noise spectrum . for atoms trapped close to the surface of a conductor",
    "these fluctuating fields can be strong enough to drive rf magnetic dipole transitions that flip the atomic spin .",
    "if the atom is in a magnetic trap where only low - field - seeking zeeman sublevels are confined , the spin flips lead to atom loss .",
    "this is known experimentally @xcite as well as theoretically @xcite .",
    "the loss rate increases strongly as the atoms approach the metallic surface of an atom chip . for a given desired lifetime , this restricts how close the trapped atoms can be brought to the surface , which in turn determines the period of the smallest trapping structures that can be imposed on the atom by the chip .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ bas_eq_q ] we introduce the basic equations and discuss the quantization of an electromagnetic field in the presence of a dispersing and absorbing dielectric body",
    ". then , in section [ gamma_sec ] , we derive a general expression for the spontaneous and thermal spin - flip rates of an atom due to the coupling of its magnetic moment to the magnetic field . this derivation is based on the zeeman hamiltonian of the system and the corresponding heisenberg equations of motion .",
    "we show that the spin - flip rate is determined by the dyadic green tensor of the classical , phenomenological maxwell equations . in section [ g_sec ]",
    "we present the scattering green tensor for a @xmath0-layer cylindrical body surrounded by an unbounded homogeneous medium , with details being given in appendix [ r_appendix ] .",
