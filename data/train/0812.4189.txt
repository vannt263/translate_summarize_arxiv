    "4u 1907 + 09 is a high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) system discovered by the uhuru survey ( giacconi et al . 1971 ) .",
    "the system consists of an x - ray pulsar accreting mass from a blue supergiant companion star .",
    "an orbital period of 8.38 days was found from ariel v observations ( marshall & ricketts 1980 ) .",

    "( 1998 ) found revised orbital parameters of the system .",
    "the evidence of two phase - locked flares at the folded orbital profile was reported ( marshall & ricketts , 1980 ; int zand et al .",
    "the presence of the two flares per orbit leaded to the suggestion of an equatorial disk like envelope around a be type stellar companion ( cook & page 1987 ) .",
    "although the variation in h@xmath5 emission in the optical observations strengthened the suggestion of a be star ( iye 1986 ) , cox et al .",

    "( 2005 ) identified the companion as an o8 - 09 ia supergiant with a distance of @xmath45 kpc .",
    "4u 1907 + 09 had been steadily spinning down for more than 15 years with an average rate of @xmath6 hz s@xmath1 ( cook & page 1987 ; int zand et al .",

    "1998 ) observations exhibit absorption features at @xmath419kev and @xmath439kev referring to the fundamental and the second harmonic of a cyclotron absorption feature corresponding to a surface magnetic field strength @xmath11 g.    in this paper , we present timing and spectral analysis of rxte monitoring observations of 4u 1907 + 09 between mjd 54280 and mjd 54690 .",
    "first , we provide a brief description of observation and analysis procedure in section 2 .",
    "the pulse timing analysis , indicating a new spin - down episode , is reported in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we present the results of x - ray spectral analysis .",
    "the analysis of rxte monitoring observations of 4u 1907 + 09 is presented in this paper .",
    "the observations between june 2007 and august 2008 are analysed , each having an average exposure time @xmath42 ksec ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the data products of proportional counter array ( pca ) onboard rxte have been reduced for the analysis .",
    "rxte - pca is a pointed instrument ( jahoda et al .",
    "1996 ) ; it consists of five co - aligned identical proportional counter units ( pcus ) sensitive in the energy range 2 - 60 kev .",
    "the effective area of each detector is approximately @xmath41300@xmath12 and the energy resolution is @xmath13 at 6 kev .",
    "a field of view ( fov ) of 1@xmath14 at full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) is small enough that , with the large geometric area , pca provides a highly sensitive time resolution .",
    "operations are carried on with various pcus turned off during observations in order to extend the life time of the instrument .",
    "the number of running pcus during the observations of 4u 1907 + 09 varies between one and three .",
    "pcu0 and pcu1 have increased background levels due to the loss of their propane layers . as it is not recommended to use data of these pcus for spectral analysis ,",
    "data of pcu2 were used during spectral analysis .",
    "no pcu selection is done for the timing analysis , since propane losses do not affect high resolution timing .",
    "the standard rxte analysis software heasoft 6.4 is used for data reduction .",
    "the standard2f mode data with 128 energy channels are examined for the spectral analysis .",
    "since the timing resolution of standard2f is low , the goodxenon mode data are used for the timing analysis using 1s long binning .",
    "the filtering applied to the data is comprised of excluding the times when , elevation angle is less than 10@xmath14 and offset from the source is greater than 0.02 . electron contamination of pcu2 is also confirmed to be less than 0.1 .",
    "the latest pca background estimator models supplied by the rxte guest observer facility ( gof ) , epoch 5c are used to generate the background light curves and spectra .",
    "the model estimation is based on the rate of very large solar events , spacecraft activation and cosmic x - ray emission . since 4u 1907 + 09",
    "is near the galactic plane and the supernova remnant w49b , additional background estimation is done for x - ray spectral analysis ( see spectral analysis section ) .",
    "for timing analysis , the background subtracted light curves were corrected to the barycenter of the solar system and to the binary orbital motion of 4u 1907 + 09 . for the correction of binary orbital motion",
    ", we used the orbital parameters deduced by int zand et al .",
    "1998 . we folded the @xmath42 ksec long light curve segments outside intensity dips on statistically independent trial periods ( leahy et al . 1983 ) .",
    "a template pulse profile was obtained from the first three observations with a total exposure of @xmath46 ksec by folding the data on the period giving the maximum @xmath15 .",
    "these three observations were made within the first week after the observations started .",
    "template pulse profile was analytically represented by its fourier harmonics ( deeter & boynton 1985 ) and cross - correlated with the harmonic representation of average pulse profiles from each @xmath42 ksec long observation .",
    "the pulse phases calculated from this analysis are presented in figure 2 .    to estimate pulse frequency derivatives ,",
    "the pulse phases were fitted to the polynomial @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the pulse phase offset deduced from the pulse timing analysis , @xmath18 is the mid - time of the observation , @xmath19 is the phase offset at t@xmath20 , @xmath21 is the deviation from the mean pulse frequency ( or additive correction to the pulse frequency ) , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the first and second pulse frequency derivatives of the source .",
    "the pulse phases and the residuals of the fit after the removal of the quadratic ( without the cubic term in equation 1 ) and cubic polynomial ( equation 1 ) are also presented in figure 2 .",
    "timing solution of the source is presented in table 1 .",
    ".timing solution of 4u 1907 + 09 [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the pulse frequency derivative from the sequence of 25 pulse phases from the observations between june 2007 and august 2008 was measured as @xmath24 hz s@xmath1 .",
    "this measurement shows that the source started to spin - down with a spin - down rate close to long term spin - down rate of the source ( baykal et al .",
    "2001 ) .    to demonstrate the torque reversal and show the recent spin - down trend of the source , we estimated the pulse frequency histories by taking the derivatives of each pairs of pulse phases from the pulse phases of this work .",
    "we presented pulse frequency history of the source in figure 3 , and listed all pulse period measurements in tables 2 .",
    "the energy range of the spectral analysis was restricted to 3 - 25 kev range since pca count statistics is poor beyond 25 kev .",
    "along with the basic estimation of pca background models , additional background model was needed because 4u 1907 + 09 is near the galactic plane and the supernova remnant w49b . during the dip states of 4u 1907 + 09 ,",
    "no pulsed emission was observed and the count rate was consistent with the diffuse emission from the galactic ridge ( int zand et al .",
    "about 20% of the processed rxte observations were detected to be in dip state , so an overall dip state spectrum was constructed for comparison .",
    "it was found that the spectral parameters are consistent with the models of diffuse emission ( valinia & marshall 1998 ) .",
    "model estimated background was directly subtracted from each individual observation and the overall dip state spectrum was used as background in xspec .",
    "systematic error of @xmath25 is applied during analysis to account for the uncertainties in the response matrix produced with pcarsp .",
    "3 - 25 kev spectra of each individual non - dip observation were first modeled with power law with a high energy cutoff and photoelectric absorption .",
    "deviation of residuals around 20 kev confirmed the presence of cyclotron absorption feature reported by mihara ( 1995 ) , makishima et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and cusumano et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . among the several models tested to fit the fundamental cyclotron line at @xmath419 kev",
    ", best results were obtained by cyclotron absorption line model `` cyclabs '' ( makishima et al .",
    "we first tried to fix the line energy to the reported value 18.9 kev , but better statistics is achieved when it is set free .",
    "the line energies was found to vary between @xmath415.0 kev and @xmath419.4 kev including 1@xmath26 errors , which are consistent with the previous studies .    the supernova remnant w49b has a strong emission feature at @xmath46.4 kev ( miceli et al .",
    "2006 ) , but after a proper background subtraction , we did not find a significant iron line complex feature from 4u 1907 + 09 .",
    "although average spectrum ( see figure 4 ) has deviating residuals around 7 kev which may correspond to iron line , adding a gaussian compenent to the spectral model did not improve the fit .    in order to investigate orbital phase dependence of orbital variations of spectral parameters and x - ray flux , we present orbital phase resolved spectroscopy of the source in figure 565 .",
    "sample spectral parameters corresponding to different orbital phases are listed in table 3 .",
    "after more than 15 years long spin - down episode with an almost constant spin - down rate of @xmath27 hz s@xmath1 ( baykal et al.2001 ) , rxte observations between march 2001 and march 2002 showed a @xmath28 factor of decrease in spin down rate compared to long - term spin down rate of the source . from the observations of integral between march 2003 and september 2005 , fritz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that source was spinning - up with a rate of @xmath7 hz s@xmath1 .",
    "we found , in this work , that the source began to spin - down again with a spin - down rate of @xmath24 hz s@xmath1 which is pretty close to the previous long term spin - down rate of the source .",
    "where i is the moment of inertia of the neutron star , @xmath30 is the spin frequency derivative , @xmath31 is the dimensionless torque , @xmath32 is mass accretion rate and @xmath33 is specific angular momentum of the accreting matter . here , @xmath34 is the fastness parameter defined as the ratio of neutron star s spin frequency to the keplerian frequency at the magnetospheric radius , which is almost equal to the accretion disk s inner radius .",
    "dimensionless torque , @xmath31 in equation 2 , is the ratio of the total ( magnetic and material torque ) to the material torque .",
    "it is , for a slowly rotating neutron star ( @xmath35 ) , expected to be positive and of the order of unity leading to spin up of the star , whereas it is expected to be negative for a fast rotating neutron star ( @xmath36 ) leading to spin down of the star ( ghosh&lamb 1979 ; wang 1995 ; li&wang 1996 , 1999 ) . since the dimensionless torque depends on the fastness parameter ( and thus the magnetospheric radius ) , it decreases and may even be negative with an increase in magnetic field or decrease in mass accretion rate .",
    "decrease in mass accretion rate leads to a decrease in x - ray flux and due to the accretion geometry changes , x - ray spectral variations may also be evident .    for 4u 1907 + 09 , observed torque reversal can not simply be explained by ghosh&lamb ( 1979 ) model since spin - up episode observed by integral and spin - down episodes with different spin - down rates have not shown significant x - ray flux and x - ray spectral variations ( baykal et al .",
    "2001 ; fritz et al . 2006 ; baykal et al .",
    "2006 ) . using this model ,",
    "it is also difficult to explain similar spin rate magnitudes observed in spin - down and spin - up episodes of 4u 1907 + 09 .",
    "absolute value of the spin rate has always been found to be @xmath37 hz s@xmath1 .    in case of accretion via stellar wind , simulations showed that transitions from spin - down to spin - up is possible even when there is not significant mass accretion rate change ( anzer et al .",
    "1987;taam&fryxell 1988a , 1988b , 1989 ; blondin et al .",
    "1990 , murray et al .",
    "however , torque reversal timescale of 4u 1907 + 09 is of the order of years which is much greater than the typical timescale of torque reversals in the simulations , found to be only of the order of hours .",
    "moreover , 4u 1907 + 09 has shown transient qpos ( quasi - periodic oscillations ) which is a sign of the presence of an accretion disk ( int zand et al . 1998a ; mukerjee et al . 2001 ; baykal et al . 2006 ) .",
    "it may also be possible that negative torques ( corresponding to spin - down episodes ) may come from a retrograde keplerian accretion disk ( nelson et al .",
    "spin - down torques may also be the result of an advection dominated sub - keplerian disk for which the fastness parameter should be higher than that of the rest of the keplerian disk causing a net spin - down ( yi et al .",
    "1997 ) or the warping of the disk so that the inner disk is tilted by more than 90 degrees ( van kerkwijk et al .",
    "torque and x - ray luminosity correlation is expected from these models which is not found for 4u 1907 + 09 .    a recent model of perna et al .",
    "( 2006 ) explains torque changes in accreting neutron stars without a need for retrograde disks . in this model ,",
    "the scenario in which the neutron star s magnetic field is tilted with respect to the axis of rotation of the neutron star is considered .",
    "for an accretion disk located in the neutron star s equatorial plane , the magnetic field strength depends on the azimuthal angle and thus the location of magnetospheric radius is variable .",
    "this can lead to regions in the disk where the propeller effect is locally at work , while accretion from other regions is possible .",
    "perna et al . ( 2006 ) shows that this accretion geometry may cause cyclic torque reversal episodes without a need for significant mass accretion rate variations .",
    "4u 1907 + 09 has an eccentric orbit and shows occasional x - ray flux dips ( int zand et al .",
    "these are indications of the transient accretion disk formation around the neutron star . on the other hand , model of perna et al .",
    "( 2006 ) is proposed for persistent prograde accretion disks like ghosh&lamb ( 1979 ) model . to understand torque reversal of 4u 1907 + 09 , transient nature of the accretion",
    "should also be taken into account .    from figure 4 ,",
    "orbital dependence of @xmath38 is evident , on the other hand there is no significant variation of power law index .",
    "@xmath38 increases just after the periastron due to the accretion flow at the periastron passage and it remains at high values until the apastron .",
    "roberts et al .",
    "( 2001 ) also found similar @xmath38 dependence on orbital phase and interpreted this @xmath38 excess as the neutron star passing through an equatorially enhanced matter envelope in an inclined orbit .",
