    "<S> aiming at the study of critical phenomena in the presence of boundaries with a non - trivial shape we discuss how lattices with an adaptive lattice spacing can be implemented . since the parameters of the hamiltonian transform non - trivially under changes of the length - scale , adapting the lattice spacing is much more difficult than in the case of the numerical solution of partial differential equations , where this method is common practice .    here </S>",
    "<S> we shall focus on the universality class of the three - dimensional ising model . </S>",
    "<S> our starting point is the improved blume - capel model on the simple cubic lattice . in our approach , </S>",
    "<S> the system is composed of sectors with lattice spacing @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , ... . </S>",
    "<S> we work out how parts of the lattice with lattice spacing @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , can be coupled in a consistent way . here , we restrict ourself to the case , where the boundary between the sectors is perpendicular to one of the lattice - axis . based on the theory of defect planes one expects that it is sufficient to tune the coupling between these two regions . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we perform a finite size scaling study . </S>",
    "<S> however first numerical results show that slowly decaying corrections remain . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that these corrections can be removed by adjusting the strength of the couplings within the boundary layers .    as benchmark </S>",
    "<S> , we simulate films with strongly symmetry breaking boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the magnetization profile and the thermodynamic casimir force . for our largest thickness @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , we find that results obtained for the homogeneous system are nicely reproduced . </S>"
