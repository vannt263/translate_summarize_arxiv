    "with the availability of new cross section data on @xmath4 annihilation into hadrons from the _ babar _ collaboration @xcite , the bottom quark mass was determined recently with unprecedented precision using inverse moment qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "the result in the @xmath5 scheme at a reference scale of @xmath1 is @xmath6 however , as was subsequently pointed out @xcite , this result relies on the assumption that pqcd is already valid at the end point of the _ babar _ data , i.e. @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the squared energy .",
    "this assumption might be questionable , as the prediction of pqcd for the @xmath9-ratio does not agree with the experimentally measured value at this point .",
    "this qcd sum rule result was also shown to depend significantly on this assumption .",
    "hence , further reductions in the error of the bottom - quark mass using qcd sum rules will depend on the ability to control this systematic uncertainty .",
    "one way of achieving this would be for a new experiment to extend the _ babar _",
    "measurement into a region where pqcd is unquestionably valid . in this paper",
    "we follow another approach based entirely on theory .",
    "we use a finite energy qcd sum rule with integration kernels involving both inverse and positive powers of the energy , as employed recently to determine the charm - quark mass @xcite .",
    "we also exploit the freedom offered by cauchy s theorem to reduce the dependence of the quark mass on the above systematic uncertainty .",
    "this is achieved by using integration kernels that reduce the contributions in the region @xmath10 to @xmath11 , where there is no data and the onset of pqcd at @xmath12 has to be assumed . as a benefit ,",
    "this procedure reduces also the continuum contribution relative to the well known @xmath13 narrow resonances .",
    "we consider the vector current correlator @xmath14 where @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the bottom - quark field .",

    "however , we find that if all known five - loop order terms are taken into account , the mass of the bottom - quark only changes by roughly @xmath40 , which is about a tenth of the accuracy of this determination .",
    "+ the taylor series expansion of @xmath22 about @xmath41 is usually cast in the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",

    "the coefficients up to @xmath49 of @xmath44 are known @xcite-@xcite .",
    "there is also a sub - leading contribution of order @xmath50 @xcite affecting the coefficient @xmath51 in eq . , as well as qed corrections .",
    "the former contributes around @xmath52 , and the latter roughly @xmath53 to the result for @xmath54 .",
    "finally , there is a non - perturbative contribution to @xmath22 from the gluon condensate , but it has been found to be completely negligible @xcite .",

    "finally , we use the effective electromagnetic couplings from @xcite .",
    "the _ babar _",
    "collaboration @xcite has performed direct measurements of @xmath72 in the _ continuum threshold _ region between @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "there is also data on the full ratio r in the bottom - quark region by the cleo collaboration @xcite dating back to 1985 .",
    "subsequently , a later cleo measurement in 1998 @xcite , at a single energy , @xmath75 , gives a total r - ratio roughly 30% lower than the 1985 data in this region .",
    "since this discrepancy remains unresolved we shall use here only the _ babar _ data . as was pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "these _ babar _ data can not be used directly in sum - rules , such as e.g. eq . , for the following reasons .",
    "first , the initial - state radiation and the radiative tail of the @xmath76 resonance must be removed .",
    "second , the vacuum polarization contribution must be taken into account .",

    "are systematic uncertainties stemming from the fact that the pqcd prediction for @xmath21 does not agree with the experimentally determined values at the end point of the data ( @xmath79 ) , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] .",
    "two possibilities for this discrepancy were considered in @xcite .",
    "* option a * : the _ babar _ data are correct , but pqcd only starts at higher energies , say at @xmath106 .",
    "use then a linear interpolation between @xmath107 and @xmath108 , rather than the prediction from ` rhad ` . * option b * : the pqcd prediction from ` rhad ` is correct , but the _ babar _ data are incorrect , perhaps affected by an unreported systematic error . in this case",
    "multiply all the data by a factor of 1.21 to make the data consistent with pqcd .",
    "in addition to these two options , we wish to consider a third possibility .",
    "* option c * : the _ babar _ data are correct , and pqcd starts at @xmath79 . however , the pqcd prediction of ` rhad ` is incorrect .",
    "the motivation for this option is that the exact analytical form of @xmath109 is only known up to one - loop level . at order @xmath48",
    "already the full analytic result has to be reconstructed using pad approximants to patch together information about @xmath22 obtained at @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "both the pad method , and the reliance on pqcd results obtained at threshold ( @xmath112 ) could introduce unaccounted systematic errors . as a measure of the dependence of the method on the prediction of @xmath113 up to @xmath81 ( chosen to be large enough so that the high energy expansion becomes a rigorous prediction ) , we use @xmath113 calculated using the high energy expansion .",
    "the prediction of @xmath109 at @xmath114 using the high energy expansion is also closer to experiment than the prediction obtained using ` rhad ` .",
    "to minimize the dependence of results for the bottom - quark mass on * option a * and * option c * , the contribution from the region @xmath115 to @xmath11 should be quenched .",
    "this can be achieved by borrowing from the method of @xcite , where a legendre polynomial was used to minimize the contribution of the then poorly known _",
    "continuum threshold _ region .",
    "we choose here a legendre - type laurent polynomial , i.e. we consider linear combinations of powers of @xmath8 chosen from the set @xmath116 .",
    "inverse powers higher than @xmath92 lead to a deterioration of the convergence of pqcd , introducing large uncertainties from changes in the renormalization scale @xmath27 and the strong coupling @xmath100 ( see also - bar mass becomes an inappropriate mass scheme when using such low moments , and an alternative mass scheme should be used . see for example @xcite . ] ) .",
    "we only use positive powers up to @xmath117 , as higher powers emphasize unknown @xmath118 terms in the high energy expansion . the optimal order of the legendre - type laurent polynomial",
    "was found to be @xmath119 or @xmath120 .",
    "first , let us consider the order @xmath119 case and let @xmath121 subject to the global constraint @xmath122 where @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 are all different .",
    "the above constraint determines the constants @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the constant @xmath128 is an arbitrary overall normalization which cancels out in the sum rule eq .. the reason for the presence of the integrand @xmath129 above is that the behavior of @xmath21 in the region to be quenched resembles a monotonically decreasing logarithmic function .",
    "hence , an inverse power of @xmath8 optimizes the quenching . as an example , taking @xmath130 ( and @xmath131 ) we find @xmath132 with @xmath8 in units of @xmath133 .",
    "there are ten different kernels @xmath134 , and the spread of values obtained for @xmath135 using this set of different kernels will be used as a consistency check on the method . outside the interval",
    "@xmath136 $ ] , @xmath137 will blow - up , which leads to a suppression of the _ continuum threshold _",
    "region relative to the well measured @xmath13-resonances .",
    "this will minimize the dependence of the results on * option b*. hence , this kernel minimizes all three sources of systematic uncertainty .",
    "the fourth - order laurent polynomial @xmath138 is also defined by the constraint eq . , but with @xmath139 .",
    "there are also five different kernels @xmath138 . in general , the higher the order @xmath140 of @xmath141 , the better the control over the systematic errors . however , the price to pay is a reduction in the rate of convergence of pqcd , though this convergence can be improved by increasing @xmath81 . in the appendix",
    "we give explicit expressions for the various kernels used in table i.",
    "we considered a total of 15 different kernels @xmath19 used in eq .",
    ", 10 from the class of kernels @xmath137 and 5 from the class @xmath138 .",
    "all these are similarly constructed ( i.e they obey eq . ) , and hence have a similar ability to reduce the dependence of the bottom - quark mass on * options a , b , c*. they do , however , place very different emphasis on theory .",
    "in particular , if say @xmath137 only included inverse powers of @xmath8 , then almost the entire right hand side of eq . would emanate from the residue , and hence from the low energy expansion of pqcd .",
    "if however @xmath137 were composed of only positive powers of @xmath8 , then only the high energy expansion of pqcd would enter the right hand side of eq ..",
    "different kernels can therefore lead to significantly different dependencies on the renormalization scale @xmath27 .",
    "our philosophy is to choose those kernels producing the lowest total uncertainty .",
    "the results from these are displayed in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "we also plot in fig.2 the range of values for @xmath142 obtained using all of the 10 kernels in the class @xmath137 , as a function of @xmath81 .",
    "remarkably , between @xmath143 , all of the masses obtained using all 10 kernels from the class @xmath144 fall in the range @xmath145 .",
    "our method gives a consistent result even in the region @xmath146 where the high - energy expansion used in the contour integral in eq .",
    "is not guaranteed to converge .",
    "using , rather , the 5 kernels in the class @xmath138 , and varying @xmath81 in the range @xmath147 , all of the masses thus obtained lie in the interval @xmath148 .",
    "these results show a great insensitivity of our method on the parameter @xmath81 , and also on which powers of @xmath8 are used to construct @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "this in turn demonstrates the consistency between the high and low energy expansions of pqcd . + for our final result we choose the optimal kernel @xmath95 to obtain @xmath149 @xmath150 this result is fully consistent with the latest lattice value @xmath151 @xcite .",
    "it is also consistent with a previous qcd sum rule precision determination @xcite-@xcite giving @xmath152 .",
    "apart from our novel qcd sum rule approach , the inputs in the latter are almost identical to ours , with the exception of their use of kernels of the form @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and the use of a value of the strong coupling with a larger uncertainty .",
    "their final result was obtained using @xmath155 , which can be seen from table [ tab : results ] as being far more sensitive to possible systematic uncertainties arising from * options a , b , c*. they also determined @xmath135 using @xmath156 , for which they obtained @xmath157 . this value is closer to our result , which may not be surprising given that it is less sensitive to * options a , b , c * than @xmath155 , although not as insensitive as using our kernels .",
    "+ in conclusion , we have discussed here a finite energy qcd sum rule method with integration kernels involving inverse and positive powers of the squared energy .",
    "the result for the bottom - quark mass has a lower total uncertainty , and is far less sensitive than the popular inverse moment method to the three systematic uncertainties identified earlier , i.e. * options a , b , c*. it should be appreciated from table i that the results eqs.- are independent of the pqcd prediction from ` rhad ` in the region between @xmath10 and @xmath158 .",
    "up to an overall constant , the integration kernels @xmath159 can be obtained from eq.(11 ) . for completeness",
