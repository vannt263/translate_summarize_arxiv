    "type ia supernovae ( sne ) are energetic events resulting from the thermonuclear explosions of carbon - oxygen chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs ( wds ) , in either single or double degenerate progenitor systems @xcite .",

    "although peaks in the polarization spectra may be associated with the blue fe lines and the s ii absorption features ( @xmath42 ) , the most significantly polarized features are the si ii and ca ii ir3 lines . at the first two epochs , the apparent rise in polarization at longer wavelengths coincides with the increasing uncertainty on the polarization commensurate with the decreasing signal - to - noise .",
    "the apparent polarization at @xmath43 is due to the significant telluric absorption around that wavelength and is not intrinsic to the sn . on the stokes @xmath44 plane ( see figure [ fig : res : squ ] ) , the data at all epochs are characterized by a central concentration of points , with significant departures at wavelengths associated with si ii and ca ii features .",
    "stokes @xmath19 was measured at @xmath45 to be @xmath46 , consistent with there being no circular polarization over the entire wavelength range ; as was the case with the previous reported broad - band polarimetric measurement of the type i sn 1972e @xcite and spectropolarimetry of type ia sn 1983j @xcite .",

    "we estimated the degree of the isp directly from the observations , under the assumption that regions of the sn spectra are intrinsically unpolarized due to line blanketing of fe lines .",
    "we identify two regions in the spectrum of sn  2012fr that are likely to be intrinsically depolarized due to multiple overlapping fe lines at the first three epochs : regions a ( @xmath49 ) and b ( @xmath50 ) , as shown in fig .",

    "it is apparent that lines in these regions have ceased to be blended and we see strong individual line profiles , so it was not included in the determination of the isp .",

    "these correspond to @xmath55 and @xmath56 , roughly aligned with the position angle of sn  2012fr with respect to the nucleus of ngc  1365 .    under the assumption that the wavelength region @xmath57 is representative of the continuum , we the weighted average continuum polarization ( after correction for the isp ) to be : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 at -11 , -5 , + 2 and + 24d respectively , consistent with null polarization .",
    "the low level of continuum polarization is consistent with a spherical photosphere ( with axial ratio @xmath62 ; ) .",
    "after correction for the isp , the only lines remaining with significant polarization are the si ii @xmath3 and ca ii ir3 lines .    at -11d , the polarization signal associated with si ii",
    "is dominated by the hv component at @xmath63 , but as the optical depth of this component decreases we no longer observe it to be polarized by -5d ; whilst the polarization signal of the lv component increases . on the stokes @xmath44 plane ( see figure [ fig : res : squ ] ) ,",
    "the polarization signals of the hv component ( observed at -11d ) and the lv component ( at -5d ) are found to be separated by @xmath64 ( which is evidence that the hv and lv components are physically separated , both in radial velocity and on the sky ) .",
    "although the degree of polarization of the lv component increases from @xmath65 ( at -5d ) to @xmath66 ( at + 2d ) , the polarization angle remains the same , implying that the lv si ii line forming region is a single continuous region covering the photosphere . at + 24d",
    ", we measure a reduced level of polarization of @xmath67 associated with the now weaker si ii absorption , accompanied by a rotation of the polarization angle through @xmath68 .    at the first epoch ,",

    "[ fig : res : ca2 ] it is clear that the stokes parameters associated with the hv component at earlier epochs are inverted with respect to the stokes parameters of the lv components observed late ( i.e. the signs of stokes @xmath17 and @xmath18 parameters for the hv component are opposite to those of the lv component ) ; this is also visible as a rotation of the polarization angle of the ca ii features on fig .",
    "[ fig : res : squ ] .",
    "this implies that the hv and lv components arise from line forming regions that are not only kinematically distinct , but also orthogonal to each other on the plane of the sky . at + 2 and + 24d ,",
    "the polarization angles of the strong ca ii absorption ( arising from the lv component ) are aligned with the highly polarized si ii feature observed at + 2d , suggesting a common line forming region ; however , the velocities of the lv ca ii components are lower and decline faster than for si ii @xmath3 . at + 24d",
    ", the polarization signal at the wavelength of the hv component is dominated by the polarization of the underlying lv component .",
    "we have presented early spectropolarimetric observations of the type ia sn  2012fr ; finding the degree of polarization to be generally low , except for significant line polarization associated with si ii and ca ii . at early times",
    "we see evidence for kinematically distinct hv components , which weaken significantly by + 2d .",
    "simultaneously , the strength of the lv components increases and their respective polarizations also increase , but at different polarization angles than the hv components .",
    "the low decline rate of the lv si ii velocity and the degree of polarization measured for the line at -5d adheres closely to the relationship established by @xcite ( see their figure 1 ) between these two parameters ; and closely matches the values measured for the 1991t - like sn 1997br @xcite .",
    "the degree of si ii polarization and the measured @xmath5 also follows the correlation found by @xcite . in comparison with the @xcite sample ,",
    "sn  2012fr is the only sn with @xmath72 that also exhibits low @xmath4 and belongs to the lvg group .",
    "based on the previous correlation established between si ii polarization and the characteristics of the late - time nebular spectrum @xcite , we predict that the profiles of lines of fe - group elements in the nebular spectrum of sn  2012fr will exhibit a blue shift .",
    "the presence of short lived hv ca ii ir3 components in the spectra of type ia sne is not unusual .",
    "@xcite modeled this feature , in sn  2003du , as arising from a low mass ( @xmath73 ) shell of primordial material from the circumstellar medium .",
    "both hv si ii and ca ii were observed in the spectra of sn  2005hj @xcite .",
    "the presence of these two features in a similar velocity space demands the presence of a large mass of sn processed material at high velocities , leading @xcite to suggest an explosive origin for the shell through pulsating delayed detonations ( pdds ; ) or mergers .",
    "the 3d signatures of these mechanisms , however , will be very different .",
    "approximate spherical symmetry is expected to be maintained in the pdd model ( although this must be verified with multidimensional simulations ) , but large scale asymmetries are expected in mergers . the overall low level of continuum polarization observed for sn  2012fr , however , is inconsistent with the asymmetric nickel distributions predicted by @xcite for violent mergers .",
    "the apparent orthogonality of the line forming regions for the hv and lv ca ii components observed for sn  2012fr , on the plane of the sky , is evidence for a simple axial symmetry .",
    "we also note that the slow rise time of the light curve of sn  2012fr and the low decline rate of the si ii velocity are consistent with the predictions of the pdd model .",
    "the spectroscopic and photometric similarities between the low @xmath74 , low @xmath5 sne , such as 1990n , 2000cx and 2005hj , with sn 2012fr , suggest that these events may be similar events observed at similar orientations ( possibly consistent with the pdd model ) .",
