    "despite theoretical expectations that the warm - hot ( @xmath3k ) component of the @xmath4 intergalactic medium contains @xmath5% of the baryons in the local universe @xcite , this material has thus far frustrated attempts at unambiguous detection and characterization .",
    "this is primarily due to its high temperatures ( @xmath6 k ) and low densities ( @xmath7 @xmath8 ) , rendering it all but undetectable through well - studied uv / optical absorption lines like lyman-@xmath9 , mgii , and oftentimes even ovi . instead",
    ", the primary signature of this warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) is expected to be highly - ionized metal x - ray lines ( both in absorption against bright background quasars and diffuse emission ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most notably ovii , oviii , and neix .",
    "given the weakness of the signal , detections of the whim have thus far been highly uncertain and/or ambiguous .",
    "a single @xmath10 oviii line toward pks 2155 - 304 ( possibly associated with a small galaxy group ) has been repeatedly confirmed @xcite , but without other detected lines at the same redshift this result remains uncertain .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter n05 ) reported `` blind '' detections of two whim lines in an extremely high signal - to - noise spectrum of the blazar mrk 421 in outburst , with one possible system at @xmath1 and another detected in multiple ionic species at @xmath0 .",
    "however , this result proved controversial given their non - detection with the xmm - newton reflection grating spectrometer ; statistical re - analyses of the absorption systems significance have also called their veracity into question @xcite . although the reported xmm upper limits are formally consistent with the best - fit chandra measurements , and certain instrumental characteristics of the xmm rgs can seriously hinder weak absorption line studies @xcite , this controversy nonetheless highlights the extreme difficulty of such blind whim searches .",
    "other studies have found stronger detections of possible whim lines , but the interpretation remains ambiguous .",
    "@xcite performed detailed ionization and curve - of - growth analyses of the strong @xmath11 x - ray absorption in the mrk 421 spectrum ; while these x - ray lines are inconsistent with _ known _ galactic gaseous components , an origin in the large - scale whim surrounding the galaxy and local group could not be conclusively inferred .",
    "emission signals detected indirectly via the x - ray background autocorrelation function @xcite and directly in overdense regions @xcite have also been found , but the former method relies heavily on proper point - source subtraction and the latter may be probing extended , bound intracluster gas rather than the `` representative '' diffuse whim .",
    "perhaps the most convincing evidence thus far has been the detection of x - ray absorption lines associated with large - scale , nonvirialized galaxy structures like the sculptor wall @xcite and the pisces - cetus supercluster @xcite .",
    "such filamentary structures are expected to be associated with large reservoirs of diffuse whim gas @xcite , and thus x - ray absorption searches focusing on such systems have a higher probability of success than their blind counterparts .",
    "however , this method also has its drawbacks : notably , gas associated with these moderately high - density regions may still not be representative of typical whim properties , and individual galaxies with small ( @xmath12kpc ) impact parameters can contaminate the whim absorption ( j.  mulchaey et al . , in preparation ) , thereby complicating the interpretation of a detection .",
    "nonetheless , the spatial coincidence of even weak x - ray absorption lines with other structures ( whether galaxies , cluster outskirts , or large - scale nonvirialized filaments ) is exciting , since little is known about the warm - hot gas in these environments . here",
    "we revisit the -detected absorption line systems reported by n05 , searching for galaxy structures in public data that have been released since the detections . in ",
    "[ sec_data ] we describe the data and selection procedure , in  [ sec_filaments ] we discuss the galaxies and structures found near the absorbers , interpretations of the results can be found in ",
    "[ sec_discussion ] , and we briefly summarize the conclusions in ",
    "[ sec_summary ] .",
    "cosmological parameters @xmath13 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are assumed throughout .",
    "markarian ( mrk ) 421 is an x - ray bright @xmath17 blazar located at @xmath18 . by combining two deep  low - energy transmission grating ( letg ) spectra of this object taken during extreme x - ray outbursts ,",
    "n05 reported the detection of two significant absorption line systems : one at @xmath19 ( detected in two absorption lines with @xmath20 significance ) and another at @xmath21 ( detected in four lines , three of which are stronger than @xmath22 ) .",
    "hereafter we refer to these absorbers as `` a1 '' and `` a2 '' respectively .",
    "the quoted redshift errors are primarily due to wavelength - dependent uncertainties in the -letg dispersion relation . taking all detected lines together , n05 report a `` conservative '' significance ( i.e.  taking into account possible spurious line detections over a wide wavelength range in their multi - component fits ) of @xmath23 for a1 and @xmath24 for a2 .",
    "since the publication of these putative whim detections , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has publicly released a comprehensive catalog of galaxy redshifts spanning the northern galactic cap ( including the mrk 421 region ) .",
    "this survey is at least 90% complete to @xmath25 @xcite , corresponding to about @xmath26 at @xmath17 ( where @xmath27 is the characteristic luminosity in the schechter function ; * ? ? ?",
    "here the incompleteness is primarily due to the 55  minimum fiber spacing in the spectroscopic survey ; in regions where the survey tiles overlap the completeness is expected to be higher , so 90% should be considered a conservative lower limit . in the sdss photometric catalog only one @xmath28",
    "galaxy lies within 55  of mrk 421 , a known companion to the quasar host at @xmath17 .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that any projected companions near mrk 421 are missed due to the minimum fiber spacing .    in order to provide samples of galaxies and galaxy structures both near and unrelated to the absorbers , we retrieved data on _ all _ galaxies ( unconstrained by sky position ) from the sdss data release 7 @xcite `` bestdr7 '' database within @xmath29kms@xmath14 around the x - ray detections : @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "these intervals are sufficiently broad to encompass all of the detected lines best - fit wavelengths in each absorption system , thus conservatively allowing for uncertainties in the absorbers redshifts ( as well as possible systematic offsets between the galaxies and filament gas ) while effectively excluding foreground and background interlopers . aside from the redshift constraints",
    ", we further required objects to be flagged as galaxies by the sdss pipeline ( specclass @xmath32 ) and have high redshift confidence ( zconf @xmath33 ) .",
    "the line - of - sight galaxy redshift distribution in a narrow cylinder ( with a radius of 5mpc ) centered on mrk 421 is shown in figure  [ fig_zhist ] ; the mean absorber redshifts are marked with arrows . in both cases ,",
    "the absorbers coincide with significant spikes in the galaxy distribution : a rather broad one spanning approximately @xmath34 and a narrow one at @xmath0 ( superposed on a larger overdensity ranging from at least @xmath35 ) .",
    "interestingly , the space between the two absorbers is largely devoid of galaxies .",
    "while the absorbers evidently lie within 5 projected mpc of galaxy structures in redshift space , the actual nature of these overdensities is not obvious from the histogram .",
    "figures  [ fig_fil011 ] and [ fig_fil027 ] therefore show the galaxy distributions within two narrow redshift slices ( depth @xmath36 ) in boxes 20mpc on a side .",
    "objects blueshifted relative to the absorbers are plotted as solid circles , and redshifted galaxies are shown as crosses .",
    "large - scale galaxy structures are again apparent in both slices : near a1 there appears to be a broad ( albeit somewhat diffuse ) filament or sheet of galaxies to the north and east of the absorber , while a2 lies on the edge of a strong , well - defined galaxy filament . in both cases , the absorbers appear to lie in `` boundary '' regions , near relatively large voids or underdense regions .",
    "to better quantify the structures near the absorbers , we reject by eye galaxies that do not appear to be `` members '' of the structure nearest each absorber ( shown as grey points ; this method is discussed further in  [ sec_caveats ] ) , and perform simple linear fits to the positions of the remaining galaxies .",
    "these fits are plotted as dashed lines in figures  [ fig_fil011 ] and [ fig_fil027 ] , and the number of galaxies as a function of perpendicular distance from these best - fit lines are shown in the inset plots .",
    "the filament near a2 exhibits a strong , nearly - gaussian shape around this line with fwhm@xmath37mpc ( though non - gaussian wings extending to @xmath38mpc may also be present ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath1 structure is not as well - defined , with galaxies more widely distributed over a span of @xmath39mpc in the perpendicular direction .",
    "there is a denser , well - defined clump or filament of galaxies to the southeast ( grey points in figure  [ fig_fil011 ] ) that may be part of a nearly north - south filament , but at a perpendicular distance of @xmath40mpc ( if extrapolated to the north ; grey line in the figure ) its association with the absorber is even less likely .",
    "taking the dashed best - fit lines as the nearest filaments `` centers , '' a1 and a2 lie at perpendicular distances of 4.7 and 2.7mpc from the centers of their respective galaxy structures .",
    "although large - scale galaxy filaments are expected to trace substantial reservoirs of whim gas , such x - ray absorbers are also likely to be present in individual galaxy halos and low - mass groups ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a1 is relatively isolated : one galaxy lies a projected 588kpc to the southwest , but this is well outside the typical extent of warm - hot galaxy halos ( up to 100kpc ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , two moderately bright ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) spiral galaxies lie somewhat closer to a2 : 364 and 397 projected kpc to the east and southeast , respectively .",
    "while it is still unlikely that gas associated with these individual galaxies halos extends to this distance , due to the proximity of these galaxies to each other ( 343kpc projected separation and exactly the same redshift ) it is possible that they reside in a bound system comparable to the local group . such a system may contain diffuse bound warm - hot gas ( analogous to intracluster media ) extending to several hundred kpc , which could be responsible for the observed x - ray absorption .",
    "however , the redshifts of the galaxies ( @xmath43 ) are at the upper edge of our selection window and @xmath44kms@xmath14 higher than the nominal absorber velocity ; the median redshift of the galaxies in the larger filament is thus a marginally better match to that of the absorber .",
    "due to their rather subjective definitions , the nature of these large - scale structures ( e.g. filaments , sheets , and/or clumps ) , and which galaxies should be included as members of the structures , are difficult to quantify ( for one novel method , see * ? ? ?",
    "because they span @xmath45mpc or more , simply counting galaxies in a cylinder of this size around an absorber provides no information on the spatial configuration of the nearby large - scale structure , or whether a well - defined filament ( if one is within the field ) actually intercepts the absorber s position . similarly",
    ", traditional measures of local galaxy density ( @xmath46th - nearest neighbor , for example ) are in a sense `` too local '' to provide information on whim - scale structures .",
    "we therefore employ a semiqualitative technique of picking out the nearest linear filamentary structures by eye , excluding galaxies which lie significantly outside those structures , and defining the filament s `` center '' through a linear fit to the sky positions of the galaxies in that redshift slice .",
    "this combines the particular strengths of human pattern recognition ( successfully employed by other studies , e.g.  galaxy zoo ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while still allowing quantitative measures of the filaments physical properties ( dimensions , redshift distribution , number of constituent galaxies , and distance from the absorber to the center ) . in principle these observations",
    "can then be compared directly to simulations as long as comparable analysis techniques are used for the mock galaxy catalogs .",
    "as noted previously , x - ray absorption systems like those reported by n05 can result from a variety of physical scenarios , including whim filaments , individual galaxy halos or outflows , and intragroup gas .",
    "taken in its entirety , the evidence that the a2 absorption system is associated with a large - scale galaxy filament is compelling .",
    "the galaxies in the vicinity of a2 fall almost exclusively within a clear filamentary structure with length at least 20mpc and fwhm of 3.2mpc ( figure  [ fig_fil027 ] ) .",
    "the 95 galaxies in this structure have a median redshift of @xmath47 , exactly coincident with the absorber , and are more or less isotropically distributed around this redshift ( with 52 galaxies at @xmath48 and 43 at @xmath49 ) .",
    "this structure also defines a strong , narrow redshift spike ( figure  [ fig_zhist ] ) , indicating that it is compact in both width and the @xmath50 direction .",
    "although some of the absorption could in principle arise in the intragroup medium of a galaxy pair @xmath51 projected kpc away , its redshift ( @xmath52 ) is not as good a match to the absorption system , so its physical distance could be as much as several mpc .    on the other hand , the lower - redshift absorber a1 is not as clearly associated with a large - scale structure .",
    "while a possible filamentary structure or sheet appears in figure  [ fig_fil011 ] , its projected distance is larger ( 4.7mpc ) and surface density lower than the filament near a2 ; according to figure  [ fig_zhist ] fewer galaxies fall near the absorber in redshift space as well . nor are the galaxy redshifts in this structure in as good agreement with the absorber redshift as a2 and its filament : 14 galaxies lie above @xmath53 and 48 lie below , with a median @xmath54 ( though this is still formally within the absorber s redshift uncertainty ) .",
    "no individual galaxy or group lies within 0.5mpc of the absorber .",
    "given the relative weakness of the a1 detection ( seen in two @xmath55 x - ray absorption lines , as opposed to the four significant lines tracing a2 ) , it is possible that this detection is spurious ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which case the lack of a nearby galaxy or large - scale structure would not be surprising .",
    "however , if the a1 absorber is real , it may represent either a true `` void '' absorption system or probe gas associated with the rather distant , diffuse sheet of galaxies to the north .    given the ubiquity of filamentary and planar structures on @xmath45mpc scales @xcite , the significance of these absorber - large scale structure associations depend strongly on how common such structures are around any given point  for example , if a diffuse sheet of galaxies like that toward a1 is typical in most @xmath56mpc fields , the presence of such a sheet near a1 becomes less physically meaningful .",
    "conversely , if such sheets are rare , a1 and the sheet are almost certainly associated .",
    "to test this empirically , we drew 140 random samples of galaxies from a larger portion of the sdss ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ; @xmath59 ) in boxes with dimensions identical to figures  [ fig_fil011 ] and [ fig_fil027 ] , smoothed the galaxy distributions with a @xmath60mpc gaussian filter to better bring out extended structure , and searched by eye for similar filamentary structures near the box centers .",
    "seven such `` random '' samples are shown in figure  [ fig_random ] alongside smoothed versions of figures  [ fig_fil011 ] and [ fig_fil027 ] ( labeled as `` a1 '' and `` a2 '' ) for comparison .",
    "again the caveat about the difficulty of quantifying such structures applies ; however , as many as @xmath61% of the random samples exhibit relatively diffuse galaxy distributions like that near a1 .",
    "by contrast , strong filaments like the one coincident with a2 are rare : only in @xmath2% of these 140 random samples do structures comparable to the filament in figure  [ fig_fil027 ] ( @xmath62 , length @xmath45mpc , width @xmath63mpc ) fall within a few mpc of the box center .",
    "this test further reinforces the conclusion that a2 is real and associated with a nearby galaxy filament ; on the other hand , the presence of a relatively common galaxy sheet near a1 may be a coincidence .",
    "using the sdss spectroscopic survey , we have investigated the presence and nature of large - scale galaxy structures in the vicinity of two possible whim absorbers reported by @xcite in the  spectrum of mrk 421 .",
    "our conclusions are as follows :    1 .   the x - ray absorber at @xmath0 coincides with a strong filamentary structure of galaxies .",
    "given that such structures are expected to be tracers warm - hot intergalactic gas , this absorption system may therefore trace the igm associated with this filament .",
    "2 .   a weaker filament or sheet of galaxies",
    "may be associated with the weaker @xmath1 absorption system . however , given the lower significance of this x - ray detection , the larger distance to the galaxy structure ( 4.7mpc ) , and the greater likelihood ( @xmath64% ) of a chance superposition , this absorber - filament alignment may be spurious .",
    "3 .   both of these absorbers lie more than 350kpc from the nearest sdss - detected galaxy ; thus , if the x - ray detections are real , they likely trace gas associated with large - scale structures rather than individual galaxies .",
