    "networks are discrete structures that can be used to describe , model and understand a variety of real systems , including complex interacting systems @xcite or the microscopic nature of space - time @xcite .",
    "recently , in network science the characterization of the complexity of networks with geometrical and topological methods is gaining large momentum with several works related to the definition of curvature of the networks @xcite , persistent homology @xcite , complex networks embedded in finite dimensions @xcite , and the study of the hyperbolicity of complex networks @xcite .    in this context , it is becoming clear that in order to characterize the geometry of networks it is important to describe the underlying structure of simplicial complexes . a simplicial complex",
    "is constructed by gluing together simplices such as points , lines , triangles etc .",
    ", along their faces .",
    "therefore different works characterize ensembles of random simplicial complexes @xcite and their geometrical and topological properties . recently a model for emergent complex network geometry has been proposed based on growing simplicial complexes @xcite .    in quantum gravity",
    "a central problem is to find the appropriate model describing the geometry of space - time at the quantum level .",
    "different approaches have been proposed in which geometry emerges from some pregeometric phase @xcite that include spin networks and loop quantum gravity @xcite , spin foams @xcite , causal dynamical triangulations @xcite , causal sets @xcite , energetic causal sets @xcite , network cosmology @xcite , and quantum graphity @xcite .",
    "network - like structures play a fundamental role in all these approaches .",
    "this suggests that the emergence of geometric structure from the quantum description of networks is a more general mathematical problem that can be not only relevant for understanding the structure of space - time , but which might also help to understand general complex network structures .",
    "already in the early days of the field of network science the relation between complex network topologies and quantum statistics was shown in the framework of the bianconi - barabasi model @xcite that is a growing network model with preferential attachment and fitness of the nodes which display a bose - einstein condensation .",
    "this model can also be extended to weighted networks @xcite described by the bose - einstein statistics and undergoing also the condensation of the weight of the links .",
    "the relation between growing cayley trees with fitness of the nodes and fermi - dirac statistics has been found in @xcite and the underlying symmetries between the models in @xcite and @xcite have been discussed in @xcite . in the context of equilibrium network models",
    "it has been shown that quantum statistics emerges to describe simple or weighted networks @xcite .    here",
    "we characterize the non - equilibrium evolution of networks constructed from growing simplicial complexes of dimension two , i.e. formed by triangles , and such that to each link we associate an energy @xmath0 .",
    "we show that geometrical complex networks emerge from this dynamical evolution which display at the same time small - world network properties @xcite , exponential or scale - free degree distribution @xcite , high clustering coefficient and high modularity @xcite .",
    "these networks can be either planar or non - planar with an euler characteristic that is either @xmath1 ( planar ) or @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the network size , indicating a finite average curvature in the network .",
    "as we will show in two limiting cases of this network dynamics , these networks describe the evolution of quantum network states .",
    "these network states are constructed along similar lines used in the quantum gravity literature @xcite by associating an hilbert space to each node of the network and two hilbert spaces to each possible link of the network .",
    "these network states evolve through a non equilibrium , markovian dynamics .",
    "the network states can be mapped to geometric networks and have an evolution described by an appropriate path integral .",
    "the network dynamics describes the paths of single histories of networks on which the path integral is calculated .",
    "we distinguish between fermi - dirac networks and bose - einstein networks .",
    "for both of them the number of triangles incident to a given link is @xmath4 .",
    "however , for fermi - dirac networks @xmath5 can only take the values @xmath6 , whereas for bose - einstein networks @xmath5 can take any integer value @xmath7 these networks evolve in such a way that at the global scale the average of @xmath5 over the links with energy @xmath0 follows the fermi - dirac statistics for the fermi - dirac network and the bose - einstein statistics for the bose - einstein network .",
    "these network structures depend on an external parameter that we call the inverse temperature @xmath8 . as a function of @xmath8",
    "they undergo major structural phase transitions in which the network structure changes drastically . in the case of the fermi - dirac network , for @xmath9",
    "the network is not any more small world , but acquires a finite hausdorff dimensionality . in the case of the bose - einstein network , for @xmath9",
    "a link acquires a finite fraction of triangles , and the nodes at the end of the link acquire a finite fraction of all the links .",
    "this geometrical phenomenon is the bose - einstein condensation for these networks .",
    "we observe here that the quantum network states studied in this paper are by no means the only way to associate a quantum state to a network .",
    "in particular in the quantum computation community , alternative approaches @xcite have been widely explored , characterizing quantum transport , quantum random networks , and quantum networks in which the links correspond to entangled states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the geometric network model with energy of the links depending on the parameter @xmath10 fixing the maximum number of triangles incident to a link .",
    "moreover we define the entropy rate of the model and we describe the observed phase transition . in sec .",

    "v we study the fermi - dirac network ( given by the geometric network model with @xmath11 ) .",
    "we show that this network characterizes the fermi - dirac quantum state , and we show that it is globally described by the fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "finally we compare the analytical results to simulations and we describe the phase transition occurring at low temperatures . in sec .",
    "vi we study the bose - einstein network ( given by the geometric network model with @xmath12 ) showing that it fully characterizes the bose - einstein quantum state , follows the bose - einstein statistics and undergoes the bose - einstein condensation at low temperatures . in sec .",
    "vii we consider the thermodynamics of the networks and we consider the case in which we project the quantum network state on an unlabeled final network state . in sec .",
    "viii we generalize the geometric model introducing a new parameter @xmath13 and a new process of addition of triangles that allows for the generation of network geometries that are not planar .",
    "we characterize the geometry of these networks and we describe the phase transitions observed at low temperature . in sec .",
    "ix we generalize the evolution of the quantum network states corresponding to the generalized geometric network model . in sec .",
    "x we describe the dual of the networks generated by the proposed model and we comment on the relation between the fermi - dirac network and spin networks . in sec .",

    "real networks display at the same time several structural properties ( including finite clustering coefficient , significant modularity , finite spectral dimension , heterogeneous degree distribution ) that have been shown to be captured by a very simple model of emergent geometry recently introduced by the authors @xcite .",

    "are treated equally , having the same probability to attract new triangles . nevertheless , in complex systems",
    ", attaching a new triangle to a given link might not have the same probability of attaching it to another link .    already in the context of complex networks growing by preferential attachment @xcite ,",
    "the heterogeneity of the nodes in attracting new links has been recognized to be essential to characterize the evolution of networks , as for example the world - wide - web or the internet @xcite .",
    "usually , this heterogeneous `` quality '' of the nodes is modeled by associating each node to an _ energy _ drawn from a given distribution .",
    "interestingly , complex networks with energy of the nodes have been shown @xcite to be characterized by quantum bose - einstein and fermi - dirac statistics , and might display a bose - einstein condensation in which one node grabs a finite fraction of the links .",
    "this phase transition is relevant for a number of complex networks including economical , technological and social networks in which nodes connected to a finite fraction of the nodes might emerge .    in the quantum gravity literature",
    ", the relation between networks and quantum states has been recently explored @xcite to construct models of emergent space - time geometry . in these works",
    ", each network is associated to a quantum network state and the network structure is dictated by an equilibrium hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "here we consider networks constructed by a non - equilibrium dynamics describing the underlying structure of simplicial complexes constructed by the addition of connected complexes of dimension @xmath14 , i.e. triangles .",
    "these networks display non trivial geometrical properties , characterizing in some limit planar random manifolds , as will be discussed later in the paper .",
    "for this reason we call them geometric networks . as in the geometric network model",
    "@xcite we assume that each link can belong at most to a number @xmath10 of triangles",
    ". moreover we associate energies both to nodes and links describing the different ability of nodes and links to attract new triangles .    in studying this model",
    "our goal is two - fold .",
    "on one side we aim at characterizing a wider class of emergent geometries , and their possible structural phase transitions in order to unveil the basic geometric properties of complex networks . on the other side we aim at furthering our understanding on the relation between the network evolution and quantum mechanics by exploring the connection between network evolution , quantum statistics , and evolution of quantum network states constructed using methods similar to the one introduced in @xcite .",
    "the energies of the nodes and of the links are defined as follows .",

    "in particular , if the energy of the nodes takes integer values , the spin of the links takes half - integer values and eqs .",
    "@xmath30 can be interpreted as the clebsch - gordon relations between the half - integer spins of the links of each triangle .",
    "this property motivates dubbing this variable a spin .",

    "planar complex networks have already been studied in the literature in several contexts @xcite , including the study of glass and foams , and planar complex networks .    the model most closely related to our model is the scale - free random network constructed by adding randomly triangles to links @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our model does not reduce to this model for any value of the parameters .",
    "in fact also the bose - einstein network for @xmath49 is not equivalent to this model .",
    "the difference is that in the bose - einstein network at @xmath49 , each link is not chosen randomly , but proportionally to the number of triangles already incident to it ( i.e. @xmath327 ) , according to a kind of `` preferential attachment '' to the link .",
    "other planar scale - free network models are the pseudo - fractal scale - free network @xcite and the apollonian networks @xcite .",
    "these network models are deterministic and yield scale - free networks with given power - law exponent , while the bose - einstein networks are stochastic planar scale - free networks whose power - law exponent depends on the distribution @xmath18 and on the value of the inverse temperature @xmath8 .",
    "other models for complex networks embedded into surfaces have been recently proposed @xcite extending approaches used already in the study of glasses and foams @xcite . in @xcite",
    "maximal embedded graphs have been characterized using a monte carlo algorithm determined by an hamiltonian which is a function of the degree of the nodes .",
    "this dynamics can explore networks embedded in surfaces of different genus , and displays a dynamical slowing down as a function of the inverse temperature of the monte carlo algorithm .",
    "therefore in these simulations the ground state , ordered network is not observed , similarly to what has been observed in models of glass and foam dynamics @xcite .",
    "this approach is very different from the one proposed in the present article , although the focus is always the characterization of the network geometry .",
    "for example the phase transitions present in the quantum complex network geometries are very different from the one observed in @xcite .",
    "in fact in the complex quantum network geometries the observed phase transitions are non - equilibrium phase transitions , they are determined by the quenched disorder in the network .",
    "instead , in @xcite the network has an equilibrium hamiltonian dynamics , the ground state is well defined but there is a dynamical slow down .",
    "moreover , in complex quantum network geometries the observed phase transitions can change the metric properties of the networks , which can go from a small - world network to a network with large diameter without changing its euler characteristic , as in the case of the phase transition observed for fermi - dirac networks . instead in @xcite , changes from small world networks to networks with large diameter occur as a function of the euler characteristic of the network .",
    "in this work we have proposed to study a geometrical network evolution based on growing simplicial complexes of dimension @xmath51 , i.e. simplicial complexes formed by triangles .",
    "the network evolution describes the evolution of a quantum network state defined by a path integral .",
    "the quantum network states are characterized by a set of quantum occupation numbers that can be mapped to the existence of nodes , links and triangles incident to the links of the geometric network . in particular",
    "we distinguish between fermi - dirac network states in which the incident triangles quantum occupation number can take only values @xmath362 , and the bose - einstein quantum network state where it can take any possible integer value @xmath363 the fermi - dirac network describes the evolution of the quantum fermi - dirac network state and the bose - einstein network describes the evolution of the quantum bose - einstein network state .",
    "the average of the number of triangles exceeding one and incident to links of energy @xmath0 follows the fermi - dirac and the bose - einstein statistics in the fermi - dirac and in the bose - einstein networks respectively .",
    "the fermi - dirac and the bose - einstein networks are complex networks , including the small - world property , high clustering coefficient , exponential and scale - free degree distributions , and high modularity .",
    "the proposed network models have an emergent random geometry , since their euler characteristic can go from @xmath1 ( planar networks ) to @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the number of nodes in the network , and can have a non - trivial distribution of the curvature @xmath106 .",
    "moreover these networks can have a phase transition as a function of the external parameter @xmath8 called the inverse temperature .",
    "for @xmath9 the fermi - dirac network is not any more small - world and the diameter @xmath96 grows as a power - law of the number of nodes @xmath3 . for @xmath9",
    "the bose - einstein network undergoes a bose - einstein condensation , and one link acquires a finite fraction of triangles , therefore the two nodes at the two ends of the link have a finite fraction of all the links .      in the future , we plan to explore further the geometrical network model by characterizing the networks with general values of the parameter @xmath10 , defining the corresponding quantum state evolution and characterizing further their topological and geometrical properties .",
    "moreover , we plan to study how quantum dynamical processes @xcite can be affected by the structure of these networks .",
    "finally we plan to consider equilibrium network models describing the underlying structure of simplicial complexes and to explore the possibility to observe further structural phase transitions in geometrical complex networks .",
