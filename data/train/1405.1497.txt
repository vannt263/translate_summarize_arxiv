    "in the voter model  @xcite , individuals are located on the vertex set of a graph and are characterized by one of two competing opinions .",
    "individuals update their opinion independently at rate one by mimicking a random neighbor where the neighborhood is defined in an obvious manner from the edge set of the graph .",
    "this is the simplest model of opinion dynamics based on the framework of interacting particle systems .",
    "the model includes social influence , the tendency of individuals to become more similar when they interact .",
    "more recently , and particularly since the work of political scientist axelrod  @xcite , a number of variants of the voter model that also account for homophily , the tendency of individuals to interact more frequently with individuals who are more similar , have been introduced .",
    "these spatial processes are continuous - time markov chains whose state at time @xmath1 is a function that maps the vertex set @xmath2 of a graph into a set of opinions : @xmath3 the common modeling approach is to equip  @xmath4 with a metric , which allows to define an opinion distance between neighbors , and to include homophily by assuming that neighbors interact at a rate which is a nonincreasing function of their opinion distance .",
    "this rate is often chosen to be the step function equal to zero if the opinion distance between the two neighbors is larger than a so - called confidence threshold and equal to one otherwise .    * model description *  in the original version of the deffuant model @xcite , the opinion space is the unit interval equipped with the euclidean distance .",
    "neighbors interact at rate one if and only if the distance between their opinion does not exceed a certain confidence threshold , which results in a compromise strategy where both opinions get closer to each other by a fixed factor .",
    "the main conjecture about this opinion model is that , at least when the initial opinions are independent and uniformly distributed over the unit interval , the system reaches a consensus when the confidence threshold is larger than one half whereas disagreements persist in the long run when the confidence threshold is smaller than one half .",
    "this conjecture has been completely proved for the one - dimensional system in  @xcite using different techniques and we also refer to  @xcite for additional results on the system in higher dimensions and/or starting from more general distributions .",
    "in contrast , in the vectorial version of the deffuant model also introduced in  @xcite , the opinion space is the hypercube equipped with the hamming distance : @xmath5 as for the general class of opinion models described above , the system depends on a confidence threshold that we call  @xmath6 from now on . to describe the dynamics",
    ", we also introduce @xmath7 for each pair of neighbors @xmath8 and @xmath9 and each configuration @xmath10 .",
    "the vectorial deffuant model can then be formally defined as the continuous - time markov chain with generator @xmath11 \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 means that both vertices are nearest neighbors and where  @xmath13 is the configuration obtained from configuration  @xmath10 by setting the opinion at  @xmath8 equal to  @xmath14 and leaving all the other opinions unchanged . in words ,",
    "each individual looks at a random neighbor at rate one and updates her opinion by moving one unit towards the opinion of this neighbor along a random direction in the hypercube unless either the opinion distance between the two neighbors exceeds the confidence threshold or both neighbors already agree .",
    "these evolution rules , which are somewhat complicated thinking of each opinion as an element of the hypercube , have a very natural interpretation if one thinks of each opinion as a set of binary opinions  in favor or against  about @xmath0 different issues .",
    "using this point of view gives the following : each individual looks at a random neighbor at rate one and imitates the opinion of this neighbor on an issue selected uniformly at random among the issues they disagree on ( if any ) , which models social influence , unless the number of issues they disagree on exceeds the confidence threshold , which models homophily .",
    "* main results *  the results in  @xcite are based on numerical simulations of the system on a complete graph where all the individuals are neighbors of each other , thus leaving out any spatial structure .",
    "in contrast , the main objective of this paper is to understand not only the role of the parameters but also the role of explicit space in the long - term behavior of the system . in particular , we specialize from now on in the one - dimensional system where each individual has exactly two nearest neighbors and set @xmath15 . in this case",
    ", the process can exhibit two types of behavior : reach a consensus or get trapped in an absorbing state where the different opinions coexist . to define mathematically this dichotomy",
    ", we say that    * the system * clusters * whenever @xmath16 for all @xmath17 , * the system * coexists * due to fixation whenever @xmath18 for some configuration @xmath19 such that @xmath20 .",
    "first , we note that , when @xmath21 , the process reduces to a superposition of @xmath0 voter models : the configuration of opinions for each given issue evolves according to a voter model which is slowed down by a factor equal to the number of issues on which neighbors disagree . in particular , it directly follows from  @xcite that the system clusters . in the nontrivial case @xmath22 ,",
    "the system has been studied numerically by the authors of  @xcite who considered a percolation model starting from the uniform product measure and predicted a phase transition for the continuous - time model between the regimes of clustering and coexistence at an approximate critical value @xmath23 . to begin with , we follow  @xcite and study the one - dimensional system starting from the uniform product measure in which the opinions at different vertices are independent and equally likely , i.e. , @xmath24 the first key ingredient to prove both clustering and coexistence is to think of each opinion profile as a collection of  @xmath0  levels each having two possible states and put a particle between two neighbors at the levels they disagree on .",
    "this induces a coupling between the dynamics of opinions and a system of annihilating random walks similar to the one introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of a confidence threshold in the opinion model translates into the following in the system of random walks : particles jump at a positive rate except the ones that are part of a pile whose size exceeds the confidence threshold which do not move because they are carried by an edge connecting two individuals who disagree too much to interact .",
    "we call a particle either active or frozen depending on whether it jumps at a positive rate or can not jump at all .",
    "when only individuals who disagree on all issues can not interact , only piles of exactly @xmath0 particles are frozen and the machinery in  @xcite , which partly relies on a delicate symmetry argument due to adelman  @xcite , easily extends to prove that each frozen particle will , after an almost surely finite time , either become active or annihilate with an active particle . from this",
    ", it can be deduced that both frozen and active particles ultimately go extinct , which is equivalent to clustering therefore we have the following result .    ",
    "[ th : flux ] assume   and @xmath25 .",
    "then , the system clusters .    to study the coexistence regime",
    ", we again use the coupling with annihilating random walks as well as a characterization of fixation based on certain spatial properties of so - called active paths that keep track of the offspring of the binary opinions initially present in the system .",
    "this characterization leads to a sufficient condition for survival of the frozen particles on a large interval , and therefore coexistence due to fixation , based on the initial number of active and frozen particles in this interval . using estimates on the random number of active particles that annihilate with frozen particles to turn a pile of frozen particles into a smaller pile of active particles , a random weight is then attributed to each pile of particles at time zero .",
    "this , together with large deviation estimates for the cumulative weight in large intervals , implies that the system coexists whenever the expected value of the weight of a typical pile is positive .",
    "relying finally on some symmetry property of the binomial random variable allows to make explicit the set of parameters for which the expected value of the weight is positive , from which we deduce the following theorem .    ",
    "[ th : uniform - fix ] assume   and @xmath26 .",
    "then , the system coexists .",
    "note that the combination of both theorems implies the existence of at least one phase transition between consensus and coexistence at some critical confidence threshold @xmath27 which gives a rigorous proof of part of the conjecture in  @xcite .",
    "to gain some insight on the reason why the critical threshold might indeed be @xmath28 , we finally look at the system starting from a non - uniform product measure where two opposite designated opinion profiles start at high density whereas the other opinion profiles start at low density .",
    "more precisely , we assume that @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a small parameter and where @xmath31 for the process starting from such an initial distribution , the methodology developed to proved theorem  [ th : uniform - fix ] can again be applied which , together with large deviation estimates for non - independent random variables , gives the following result .    ",
    "[ th : biased - fix ] assume   and @xmath32 . then , the system coexists for all @xmath33 small .    even though the theorem only gives a sufficient condition for coexistence due to fixation",
    ", the proof somewhat suggests that this condition is also necessary .",
    "our intuition relies on the fact that the largest blockades contain  @xmath0 frozen particles while the collision of @xmath34 active particles with such a blockade can create a total of @xmath6 active particles .",
    "in particular , when @xmath35 , it is possible that the number of active particles created is at least equal to the number of active particles destroyed , which leads ultimately to a global extinction of all the particles and therefore clustering .",
    "we refer the reader to figure  [ fig : diagram ] for a summary of our results .",
    "the rest of this paper is devoted to proofs starting in the next section with the coupling with annihilating random walks which is then used to show our three theorems in the subsequent three sections .",
    "in this section , we follow the approach of @xcite to define a coupling between the process and a collection of systems of symmetric annihilating random walks .",
    "the basic idea is to visualize each opinion profile , i.e. , each vertex of the hypercube , using  @xmath0  levels each having two possible states and put particles between two neighbors at the levels they disagree on . for an illustration",
    ", we refer the reader to figure  [ fig : layers ] where black and white dots represent the two possible opinions on each issue and where the crosses indicate the position of the particles . to make this construction rigorous",
    ", we first identify the process with the spin system @xmath36 this again defines a markov process . to describe this system of particles",
    ", it is also convenient to identify the edges connecting neighbors with their midpoint @xmath37 and to define translations on this set of edges by setting @xmath38 the process that keeps track of the disagreements is then defined as another spin system @xmath39 and we put a particle on edge @xmath40 at level @xmath41 if and only if @xmath42 to visualize the corresponding configuration of interfaces .",
    "the reason for introducing this system of particles is that    * the limiting behavior of the process   can be easily translated into simple properties for the system of particles  : clustering is equivalent to extinction of the particles whereas coexistence is equivalent to survival of the particles and * the particles of   consist of a collection of systems of simple symmetric annihilating random walks somewhat easier to analyze than the vectorial deffuant model itself .",
    "the number of particles per edge , defined as @xmath43 is a key quantity to fully describe the dynamics of the system of particles since it is equal to the opinion distance between the two individuals connected by the edge .",
    "indeed , @xmath44 using that the number of particles on the edge is equal to the opinion distance , we deduce that an interaction along edge @xmath45 results in the following alternative :    1 .",
    "there are more than @xmath6 particles on the edge in which case nothing happens because the opinion distance between the neighbors exceeds the confidence threshold .",
    "2 .   there are at most @xmath6 particles on the edge in which case one of the issues for which the two neighbors disagree is chosen uniformly at random and the opinion of either vertex  @xmath8 or vertex  @xmath46 at this level is switched . note that the issues the two neighbors disagree on correspond to the levels which are occupied by a particle so , after the interaction , the particle at the chosen level disappears while the state of one of the two edges @xmath47 at the same level switches from either empty to occupied or from occupied to empty .    combining 1 and 2",
    ", we deduce that the system of particles   evolves at each level according to a system of simple symmetric annihilating random walks as illustrated in figure  [ fig : layers ] .",
    "in addition , since the issues on which neighbors disagree are chosen for update uniformly at random , at each edge occupied by @xmath48  particles , these particles jump individually at rate @xmath49 making the  @xmath0 systems of symmetric annihilating random walks non - independent .",
    "motivated by the transition rates in , we call an edge either a * live edge * or a * blockade * depending on whether they have at most or more than @xmath6 particles , respectively . accordingly , we call the particles at this edge either * active * or * frozen * particles , respectively , and notice that active particles jump at a positive rate whereas frozen particles can not jump at all .    both the vectorial deffuant model and its coupled systems of annihilating random walks starting from any initial configuration can be constructed from the same percolation structure using a standard argument due to harris @xcite .",
    "this percolation structure consists of a random graph involving independent poisson processes marking the times at which potential jumps or interactions occur and additional collections of independent bernoulli random variables and uniform random variables to determine the outcome of each jump or interaction . to make this construction rigorous , for each pair of individual - issue or vertex - level @xmath50 ,    *",
    "we let @xmath51 be a rate one poisson process , * we denote by @xmath52 its @xmath53th arrival time : @xmath54 , * we let @xmath55 be a collection of independent bernoulli variables with @xmath56 * and we let @xmath57 be a collection of independent @xmath58 .    then , at each time @xmath59 , we draw an arrow @xmath60 and call this arrow an * active * arrow if and only if @xmath61 the vectorial deffuant model and the systems of annihilating random walks can then be constructed from the resulting percolation structure by assuming that arrows which are not active have no effect on any of the two processes whereas if the @xmath41-arrow is active then    * at time @xmath1 , the individual at vertex  @xmath9 looks at the individual at vertex  @xmath8 and imitates her opinion for the @xmath41th issue , therefore we set @xmath62 , * the particle at @xmath63 at level  @xmath41 jumps to @xmath64 .    to establish our coexistence results , it is also useful to identify the vertices where the opinions of the profile of some given vertex at some given time originate from .",
    "this can be done looking at * active paths * : we say that there is an active @xmath41-path from @xmath65 to @xmath66 whenever there are sequences of times and vertices @xmath67 such that the following two conditions hold :    1 .   for @xmath68 , there is an active @xmath41-arrow @xmath69 at time @xmath70 .",
    "2 .   for @xmath71",
    ", there is no active @xmath41-arrow that points at @xmath72 .",
    "we say that there is a generalized active path from @xmath65 to @xmath66 whenever    1 .   for @xmath68 , there is an active arrow @xmath69 at time @xmath70 .",
    "later , we will use the notations @xmath73 and @xmath74 to indicate the existence of an active @xmath41-path and a generalized active path .",
    "we also point out that for every space - time point @xmath66 there is a unique space - time point @xmath75 such that both points are connected by an active @xmath41-path which , using a simple induction , implies that the corresponding individuals at the corresponding times agree on the @xmath41th issue , i.e. , @xmath76 is the ancestor of @xmath66 for the @xmath41th issue .",
    "in this section , we prove that , when  @xmath25 , the opinion model clusters . to begin with , we note that , in this parameter region , the vectorial deffuant model is closely related to the two - state axelrod model  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the one - dimensional construction in the previous section can be applied to the latter , which again results in a system of non - independent annihilating random walks .",
    "the only difference between the two models is that , in the system of random walks coupled with the axelrod model , at each edge occupied by  @xmath48  particles , these particles jump at rate @xmath77 in particular , when @xmath25 , it follows from and that , for both models , an edge is a blockade if and only if it has exactly @xmath0 particles : @xmath78 now , clustering of the two - state axelrod model has been proved in @xcite and , while it heavily relies on the fact that an edge is a blockade if and only if it has @xmath0 particles , the proof is not sensitive to the exact rate at which active particles jump .",
    "in particular , theorem  [ th : flux ] directly follows from the arguments introduced in  @xcite for the axelrod model .",
    "in addition to the coupling with annihilating random walks , there are two key ingredients : each blockade breaks eventually with probability one and , as a consequence , the system of active and frozen particles goes extinct .",
    "below , we only give the idea of the proof and refer to sections 3 and 4 in  @xcite for more details .",
    "+ * blockade destruction *  the first step is to prove destruction of the blockades : assuming that a designated edge @xmath79 is a blockade at some time @xmath1 , we have @xmath80 the proof of   relies on two ingredients : parity preserving of the number of particles at each level and a symmetry argument introduced by adelman @xcite to show site recurrence of systems of annihilating random walks .",
    "to briefly explain parity preserving , assume that    * edge @xmath81 with @xmath82 also is a blockade at time @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath83 , and * between the two blockades @xmath79 and @xmath81 , the number of particles at some level  @xmath41 and the number of particles at some other level  @xmath48 do not have the same parity , i.e. , @xmath84    now , let @xmath85 be the first time one of these two blockades breaks .",
    "since particles at the same level annihilate by pairs , the parity of the number of particles between the two blockades is preserved at each level and up to time @xmath85 .",
    "this , together with , implies that , up to time @xmath85 , there is at least one active particle between the two blockades so either this particle or another active particle outside the interval breaks one of the blockades after a finite time : @xmath86 the property in can be deduced from its analog   for two blockades also using some symmetry arguments through the following construction .",
    "first , we introduce @xmath87 next , we partition the half - line into intervals with the same length as @xmath88 by setting @xmath89 and let @xmath90 be the smallest @xmath53 such that    * the configurations of particles in @xmath88 and @xmath91 at time @xmath1 can be obtained from one another by translation or reflection and * none of the edges in @xmath91 has been updated by time @xmath1",
    ".    then , letting @xmath81 be the rightmost edge in @xmath92 ,    1 .",
    "the probability that   holds , in which case holds as well , is @xmath93 , 2 .",
    "the probability that the configurations of particles in @xmath88 and @xmath92 at time @xmath1 can be obtained from one another by reflection is @xmath93 , and 3 .   by symmetry , the conditional probability given and reflection that the blockade  @xmath79 breaks before the blockade  @xmath81 is equal to  1/2 .    from ( a)(c )",

    "all three events in ( a)(c ) occur , from which it follows that time @xmath97 is almost surely finite . +",
    "* extinction of the particles *  to complete the proof of the theorem , it suffices to show extinction of the system of random walks , since this property is equivalent to clustering of the original opinion model .",
    "the proof deals with active particles and frozen particles separately .",
    "first , we assume by contradiction that the expected number of active particles at edge @xmath40 , which does not depend on the choice of @xmath40 due to translation invariance , does not converge : @xmath98 since the expected number of active particles per edge can only decrease due to annihilating events or active particles becoming frozen , the fact that the expected number of active particles per edge goes infinitely often from the @xmath99 to the @xmath100 in implies that @xmath101 which is not possible . in particular , is not true . now",
    ", we assume by contradiction that the expected number of active particles per edge converges to a positive limit : @xmath102 since one - dimensional symmetric random walks are recurrent , each active particle either gets annihilated or becomes frozen eventually with probability one therefore implies that , at all times , the expected number of annihilating events per edge per unit of time or the expected number of freezing events per edge per unit of time is larger than some positive constant , which again leads to the impossible statement  .",
    "it follows that   is not true . to deal with the frozen particles , we first observe that , since the expected number of particles per edge can only decrease , it has a limit as time goes to infinity",
    "this , together with the fact that the expected number of active particles per edge has a limit , implies that the expected number of frozen particles per edge has a limit as well , and we assume by contradiction that this limit is positive : @xmath103 since each blockade breaks eventually with probability one according to   and since each blockade destruction results in the annihilation of two particles , implies that the expected number of annihilating events per edge per unit of time is larger than a positive constant , thus leading to the left - hand side of  , again a contradiction .",
    "therefore , the frozen particles go extinct .",
    "this section is devoted to the study of the coexistence regime for the system starting from the uniform product measure  .",
    "the first ingredient is the next lemma , which gives a sufficient condition for fixation and is similar to lemma  2 in  @xcite where it is applied to cyclic particle systems .    ",
    "[ lem : fixation ] for all @xmath104 , let @xmath105 then , the system fixates whenever @xmath106    this follows exactly the proof of lemma  4 in reference  @xcite .",
    "+   + to motivate the structure of the proof , we first use lemma  [ lem : fixation ] to explain in detail the connection between the initial configuration of the system , i.e. , the initial number of active particles and the initial number of frozen particles , and the key event @xmath107 that appears in  . following the same approach as  @xcite , we let @xmath85 be the first time an active @xmath41-path that originates from the interval @xmath108 hits the origin , and observe that @xmath109 from which it follows that @xmath110 can be written as @xmath111 letting @xmath112 be the initial position of this active path and @xmath113 and defining @xmath114 , we have the following two properties :    * all the blockades initially in  @xmath115 must have been destroyed , i.e. , turned into piles of @xmath6  active particles due to annihilating events , by time @xmath85 .",

    "more precisely , we look at the probability that the first jump of an active particle onto the blockade results in an annihilating event , which can be computed explicitly using the following symmetry argument : since both the initial distribution and the dynamics of the model are invariant by permutation of the levels , and since the configuration of particles outside  @xmath40 is independent of the distribution of particles at  @xmath40 by the time of the first jump of an active particle onto  @xmath40 , this first jump occurs with equal probability at each level . in particular , the first jump of an active particle onto the blockade  @xmath40 results in either    *",
