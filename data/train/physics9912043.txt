    "the human genome project aims to provide the complete sequence of the 3 billion base - pairs of the human genome .",
    "while the dominant method for analyzing dna fragments remains gel electrophoresis , new technologies that have the potential to increase the rate and decrease the cost of dna sequencing and analysis , such as mass spectrometry and hybridization arrays , are critical to the project s success @xcite .    here",
    "we describe a novel method of dna transport and separation based on a brownian ratchet . as described originally by smoluchowski and",
    "noted by feynman , a brownian particle can undergo net transport on a potential energy surface that is externally driven to fluctuate between several distinct states @xcite .",
    "brownian ratchets have attracted theoretical attention @xcite due to their description of molecular motors @xcite and to their similarity with phenomena termed stochastic resonance and resonance activation @xcite .",
    "brownian ratchets have been demonstrated to transport @xmath4m- to mm - sized particles using dielectrophoresis @xcite , optical tweezers @xcite , and electrocapillary forces @xcite to generate ratchets .",
    "other devices based on entropic ratchets @xcite or physical barriers @xcite have been proposed as well .",
    "more recently , a geometrical sieve device has been used to separate phospholipids@xcite .    despite these successes , the brownian ratchet mechanism has not before proved capable of transporting dna fragments in the size ranges applicable to dna sequencing ( @xmath5 1000 nt ) because the interactions used to establish the ratchet potential were too weak .",
    "in contrast to previous devices using polarization interactions to generate ratchets @xcite , we have fabricated a device that uses charge - charge interactions to generate the ratchet potential .",
    "as seen below , the charge - charge interactions have sufficient strength to establish ratchets that can trap small dna fragments .",
    "the ratchet - like wells that trap dna are generated by charging a series of patterned electrodes .",
    "when the electrodes are discharged , the traps vanish and the molecules undergo brownian motion . next the potential is re - applied , and the particles again collect in the traps .",
    "a spatial asymmetry in the shape of each ratchet - shaped well rectifies the brownian motion and produces net transport as the on - off cycle is repeated .",
    "each molecule s transport rate depends on its diffusion constant , allowing the possibility of size - based separations .",
    "we have implemented the device by microfabrication on a silicon chip .",
    "this report describes the brownian ratchet theory , provides a derivation of the transport rate , and presents experimental results for a single sized dna oligomer .",
    "greater details regarding the fabrication methods and a more extensive presentation of the experimental results for a variety devices and oligomer sizes are available elsewhere @xcite .",
    "a silicon wafer with six micromachined devices is shown in fig .  [",
    "f : device ] , with a schematic design below .",
    "the electric potential that creates the ratcheting traps is generated by two arrays of interdigitated electrodes that are perpendicular to the transport axis .",
    "the two sets of arrays each extend from bond pads on opposite sides of the device .",
    "the spacing between electrodes extending from the same bond pad is @xmath6 .",
    "the asymmetric pattern creates two different spacings , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , between electrodes extending from opposite bond pads .",
    "the smaller spacing @xmath7 defines the feature size of the device .    as shown in",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ f : device ] , a simplified one - dimensional description of the potential approximates the electrodes as infinitely thin wires . to simplify the theoretical model , we have neglected the finite width of the electrode , the dependence of the electric potential on the distance normal to the surface , and the corresponding detailed calculation of the potential along the transport axis .",
    "when a voltage difference @xmath9 is applied across the two electrode arrays during the on - state , with duration @xmath10 , sawtooth - shaped ratcheting traps are created for charged particles .",
    "the electrodes are discharged to @xmath11 during the off - state , with duration @xmath12 , and particles undergo isotropic brownian diffusion .",
    "when the potential is re - applied , the particles are again trapped in potential wells .",
    "the times @xmath10 and @xmath12 are within the low - frequency , quasi - static approximation ; nonadiabatic effects and current reversals , reported elsewhere @xcite , are not applicable in this regime . due to the asymmetry of the sawtooth shape and the choice of @xmath12 , a particle starting from well 0 has a measurable probability to be trapped in well  1 and virtually zero probability to be trapped in well  @xmath13 .",
    "transport can be generated by repetitive cycling between the on - state and the off - state .",
    "the transport properties of a particle are determined by its diffusion constant @xmath14 and its charge @xmath15 , along with the thermal energy @xmath16 and the device parameters defined previously .",
    "each cycle begins by applying the potential @xmath9 for a time @xmath17 that is sufficient to localize particles at the bottoms of the trapping wells .",
    "a particle at the barrier - top drifts down the side of the sawtooth of length @xmath8 to find the bottom of the well , which defines the time required for complete trapping , @xmath18 according to overdamped brownian motion . at the end of the trapping ,",
    "the particle distribution at the bottom of a well is assumed to be much narrower than the feature size @xmath7 .    in the next phase of the cycle ,",
    "the potential is turned off for time @xmath12 .",
    "when the potential is re - applied , particles that have diffused further than the barrier to the left ( roughly distance @xmath6 away ) will hop to the previous well , and particles that have diffused further than the barrier to the right ( roughly distance @xmath7 away ) will be transported to the next well . since @xmath19",

    "an expression for @xmath21 valid in the limit of large @xmath12 is @xmath33 .    after each cycle , the particle distribution shifts to the right the distance @xmath34 .",
    "after @xmath35 cycles , the envelope of the distribution of particles in each well evolves as a gaussian with center @xmath36 and square width @xmath37 :    @xmath38    @xmath39    here we have assumed that all the particles are in well 0 at the start of the first cycle .    both @xmath21 and the steady - state flux of particles through the device , @xmath40 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f : flux ] .",
    "the transport fraction @xmath21 ( black line ) increases with @xmath12 and approaches a maximum value of 1/2 when back - diffusion is neglected . the flux in units of the characteristic time @xmath41 is @xmath42 and is shown for @xmath43 .",
    "the flux is non - monotonic and exhibits a maximum when @xmath44 .",
    "other voltage modulations more complicated than the on - off pattern described here are also possible and can change the direction of particle flow according to particle size @xcite .",
    "other similar types of non - monotonic behavior have been termed stochastic resonance and resonance activation@xcite although they may also be described by dispersion and linear response@xcite .",
    "devices were fabricated from pt , a non - reactive , corrosion - resistant metal chosen to avoid electrolysis of water , using relatively standard micromachining technologies @xcite .",
    "the fabrication began with thermally oxidized 100  mm diameter silicon wafers .",

    "a microscope slide cover glass ( macalaster bicknell , new haven , ct ) cut to size was used to confine the solution to a uniform thickness of approximately 10  @xmath4 m .",
    "a sealing compound was used to obtain a liquid tight seal along the edges , leaving the ends open .",
    "square wave modulation ( synthesized function generator ds345 , stanford research systems , sunnyvale , ca ) with an amplitude of 1.6  v and offset of 0.8  v ( one set of electrodes at 0  v and the second set at 1.6  v ) was applied to the electrodes to generate the flashing ratchet potential .",
    "frequencies ranging from 0.7  hz to 8  hz were used , with a ratio @xmath45 .",
    "video images of the analyte fluorescence were used to record the dna transport .",

    "we visually ascertained that the trapping time @xmath10 was sufficient to permit complete focusing of the dna on the positive electrodes , even for the fastest switching rate of 8  hz ( @xmath50 0.03  sec ) .",
    "in fig .  [ f : frames ] we show three images from a typical experiment using a device with 2  @xmath4 m electrodes and a 0.7  hz switching frequency to transport a rhodamine - labeled dna 50mer .",
