    "graphene is a 2d sheet of carbon atoms which finds diverse applications in nanotechnology and other fields due to its unusual electrical , mechanical and optical properties @xcite . as a potential element of nano- and microelectromechanical devices ,",
    "graphene can be separated by distances of the order of tens or hundreds of nanometers from the other elements .",
    "these are the distances at which the van der waals and casimir forces caused by the zero - point and thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field become dominant @xcite .",
    "that is why the fluctuation induced _ dispersion _ forces from graphene have attracted considerable attention in the last few years .",
    "many papers have been devoted to the calculation of van der waals and casimir forces between two graphene sheets @xcite , a graphene sheet and a material plate made of metallic , semiconductor or dielectric materials @xcite , a graphene sheet and an atom , a molecule , or other polarizable particle @xcite .",
    "the calculations of the free energies and forces were performed using the lifshitz theory @xcite or its equivalent combined with the reflection coefficients on graphene expressed via some version of the density - density correlation function @xcite or the polarization tensor for graphene defined in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional space - time @xcite .",
    "it was found @xcite that the thermal casimir force in graphene systems is qualitatively different from the case of plates made of conventional materials where the classical regime holds at separations exceeding the so - called _ thermal length _ equal to a few micrometers at room temperature @xcite .",
    "however for the configuration of two parallel graphene sheets , the classical behavior of the casimir interaction , characteristic for the case of large separations ( high temperatures ) , holds at separations exceeding a few hundred nanometers @xcite , i.e. , for an order of magnitude shorter separations than for conventional materials .",
    "measurements of the casimir force between two freestanding graphene sheets present additional difficulties , as compared to the case of metallic or semiconductor surfaces ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a review of experiments on measuring the casimir force ) . because of this , in the pioneering experiment @xcite the gradient of the casimir force was measured between an au - coated sphere and a graphene sheet deposited on a sio@xmath0 film covering a si plate .",
    "measurements have been performed by means of a dynamic atomic force microscope ( afm ) operated in the frequency - shift technique , i.e. , using a method well tested in previous experiments with metallic test bodies @xcite and demonstrated its high efficiency . however , the comparison of experiment with theory in ref .",
    "@xcite used an approximate additive method where the gradients of the casimir force between a si - sio@xmath0 system and an au - coated sphere , and between a graphene sheet described by the dirac model and the same sphere , were computed independently and then added .",
    "such an approximation was applied in the absence of exact reflection coefficients for graphene deposited on a substrate at nonzero temperature ( the available reflection coefficients @xcite were expressed in terms of the density - density correlation function or , equivalently , the conductivity of graphene whose explicit dependence on the temperature remained unknown ) . as a result , the theoretical force gradient computed using an assumption of additivity overestimated the measured force gradient .",
    "this was explained @xcite by the fact that an additive method does not take into account the screening of the sio@xmath0 surface by the graphene layer .",
    "thus , up to now a complete quantitative theory explaining the measurement data of ref .",
    "@xcite has been missing leading to some uncertainty in the demonstrated influence of graphene on the casimir force .    in this paper",
    ", we express the reflection coefficients for a graphene sheet deposited on a multilayered substrate made of conventional materials via the components of the polarization tensor defined at any nonzero temperature and the dielectric permittivities of substrates .",
    "the obtained reflection coefficients coincide with those found recently by another method @xcite .",
    "then , we substitute the obtained reflection coefficients in the lifshitz theory and calculate the gradient of the casimir force in the experimental configuration of ref .",
    "@xcite with no additional assumptions or fitting parameters .",
    "we demonstrate that the experimental data are in a very good agreement with theory within the limits of experimental errors .",
    "thus , the developed theory confirms the demonstration of the casimir force from graphene in ref .",
    "@xcite and can be used for interpretation of future experiments on measuring the casimir interaction from graphene deposited on multilayered material substrates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we express the reflection coefficients from graphene deposited on a thick material plate ( semispace ) in terms of the components of the polarization tensor .",
    "section  iii contains the generalization of these reflection coefficients for graphene deposited on a multilayered substrate and the comparison between the developed theory and the experimental data of ref .",

    "iv the reader will find our conclusions and discussion .",
    "first , we consider a thin film spaced above a thick plate ( semispace ) parallel to it in vacuum separated by a gap of thickness @xmath1 . let the film be characterized by the amplitude reflection coefficient @xmath2 and the transmission coefficient @xmath3 , and the plate be characterized by the amplitude reflection coefficient @xmath4 ( we are interested in the reflection coefficients calculated along the imaginary frequency axis @xmath5 ) .",
    "note that the amplitude coefficients correspond to ratios of the reflected ( transmitted ) complex - valued amplitudes of the electric field to that of the incident field .",
    "they are different from the power coefficients which are the fractions of the incident power that is reflected or refracted at the interface .",
    "then , taking into account multiple reflections on the plane of the film and on the upper boundary plane of the plate , one obtains the reflection coefficient @xmath6 on the system consisting of the film , the gap and the plate ( see , for instance , ref .",

    "<S> the developed theory is applied to calculate the gradient of the casimir force between an au - coated sphere and a graphene sheet deposited on a sio@xmath0 film covering a si plate , which is the configuration of a recent experiment performed by means of a dynamic atomic force microscope . </S>",
