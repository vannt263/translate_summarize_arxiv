    "despite the substantial effort toward quantizing gravity in 4 dimensions , this issue is still open .",
    "one of the best candidates till now is the superstring theory formulated in 10 dimensions .",
    "a way from superstring theory to 4-dimensional quantum gravity or standard model of particle physics ( minimal supersymmetric extension thereof ) is , at best , highly non - unique .",
    "many techniques of compactifications and flux stabilization along with specific model - building branes configurations and dualities , were worked out toward this end within the years .",
    "possibly some important data of a fundamental character are still missing .",
    "the point of view advocated in this paper is that indeed we have not respected till now 4-dimensional phenomena of different smoothings of euclidean @xmath0 which presumably are very important for the program of qg .",
    "there are strong evidences that exotic 4-smoothness on compact manifolds should be taken into account by any qg theory @xcite . here",
    "we refer to open 4-manifolds and try to consider exotic @xmath0 s as serving a link between higher dimensional superstring theory and 4-dimensional , , physical theories and 4-dimensional qg .",
    "string theory would describe directly 4-dimensional structures at the fundamental level .",
    "this paper serves as a step toward seeing exotic smooth @xmath0 as fundamental objects underlying higher dimensional ( super)string theory .",
    "further results regarding compactification and realistic 4-dimensional models of various brane configurations in string theory and their relation to exotic 4-smoothings , will be presented separately .",
    "the problem with successful inclusion of the effects of 4-open - exotics into any physical theory , is the notorious lack of an explicit coordinate - like description of these smooth manifolds . in the series of our recent papers we addressed this issue and worked out some relative techniques allowing for analytical treatment of small exotic @xmath0 s @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that description of d - branes in some exact string backgrounds are related with 4-smoothness of @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the deep quantum regime of the d - branes is also 4-exotic sensitive .",
    "however the connection of abstract , generalized quantum d - branes to the actual superstring theory d - branes ( in the manifold limit ) is not directly given .",
    "the witten limit of superstring theory where d - branes yield their noncommutative world - volumes is only the midway and in fact motivates the full @xmath1 algebra approach @xcite .",
    "this last serves as a possible partial solution to the problem of describing quantum d - branes in superstring theory .",
    "the connection with exotic @xmath0 at this , quantum level is unexpected and shows that 4-dimensionality may get into the game in string theory through back - door of nonperturbative quantum regime . in the last section of the paper we use the @xmath9algebra approach to quantum d - branes to construct a manifold model of a quantum d - brane as wild embedding .",
    "then we show that the @xmath9algebra of the wild embedding is isomorphic to the @xmath9algebra of the quantum d - brane .",
    "furthermore we construct a quantum version of an action using cyclic cohomology and get the right limit to the classical d - brane described by the born - infeld action .    the basic technical ingredient of the analysis of small exotic @xmath0 s enabling uncovering many applications also in string theory is the relation between exotic ( small ) @xmath0 s and non - cobordant codimension-1 foliations of the @xmath4 as well gropes and wild embeddings as shown in @xcite .",
    "the foliation are classified by godbillon - vey class as element of the cohomology group @xmath10 . by using the @xmath11-gerbes it was possible to interpret the integral elements @xmath12 as characteristic classes of a @xmath11-gerbe over @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the main line of the topological argumentation can be briefly described as follows :    1 .   in bizacas",
    "exotic @xmath0 one starts with the neighborhood @xmath13 of the akbulut cork @xmath14 in the k3 surface @xmath15 .",
    "the exotic @xmath0 is the interior of @xmath13 .",
    "this neighborhood @xmath13 decomposes into @xmath14 and a casson handle representing the non - trivial involution of the cork .",
    "3 .   from the casson",
    "handle we construct a grope containing alexanders horned sphere .",
    "akbuluts construction gives a non - trivial involution , i.e. the double of that construction is the identity map .",
    "5 .   from the grope",
    "we get a polygon in the hyperbolic space @xmath16 .",
    "this polygon defines a codimension-1 foliation of the 3-sphere inside of the exotic @xmath0 with an wildly embedded 2-sphere , alexanders horned sphere .",
    "finally we get a relation between codimension-1 foliations of the 3-sphere and exotic @xmath0 .",
    "this relation is very strict , i.e. if we change the casson handle then we must change the polygon .",
    "but that changes the foliation and vice verse .",
    "finally we obtained the result : + _ the exotic @xmath0 ( of bizaca ) is determined by the codimension-1 foliations with non - vanishing godbillon - vey class in @xmath17 of a 3-sphere seen as submanifold @xmath2 . _",
    "in this section we take the point of view that exotic smoothness of some small exotic @xmath0 s when localized on @xmath2 , correspond to some stringy geometry given by so - called @xmath3-fields on @xmath4 .",
    "the localization is understood as the representation of the exotics by 3-rd integral or real cohomologies of @xmath4 .",
    "this correspondence takes place in fact for a classical limit of the geometry of string backgrounds , i.e. curved riemannian manifold with b - field .",
    "one can say that localized exotic smooth @xmath0 on @xmath4 is described by stringy geometry of @xmath3-fields on this @xmath4 . the correspondence can be extended over string regime of finite volume of @xmath5 wzw model .",
    "we want to focus on changing the smoothness of @xmath0 and considering the changes as localized on @xmath4 .",
    "as follows from @xcite this gives rise to stringy effects , since the changes can be described by computations in some 2d cft , namely wzw models on @xmath5 at finite level .",
    "first we are going to discuss bosonic @xmath5 wzw model and dynamics of branes in it .",
    "we deal here with @xmath4 hence the nonzero metric of string background . in general",
    ", non - vanishing curvature @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a non - constant metric , of the background manifold @xmath20 on which bosonic string theory is formulated , enforces that @xmath21 -field on @xmath15 can not vanish .",
    "this is since the string field equations gives rise to ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the nsns 3-form , @xmath24 is the b - field , and dilaton is fixed to be constant .",
    "also in the case of superstring theory this equation still holds true provided all rr background fields vanish @xcite .",
    "d - branes in group manifold @xmath5 ( at the semi - classical limit ) are determined as wrapping the conjugacy classes of @xmath5 , which are 2-spheres @xmath25 plus 2 points - poles , seen as degenerated 2-spheres . due to the quantization conditions",
    "there are @xmath26 d - branes on the level @xmath6 @xmath5 wzw model @xcite . to grasp the dynamics of the branes",
    "one should deal with the gauge theory on the stack of @xmath27 d - branes on @xmath4 which is quite similar to the flat space case where noncommutative gauge theory emerges @xcite .    for @xmath27 branes of type @xmath28 on top of each other , where @xmath28 is the representation of @xmath29 i.e. @xmath30",
    ", the dynamics of the branes is described by the noncommutative action :    @xmath31    here the curvature form @xmath32+f_{\\mu\\nu\\rho}a^{\\rho}$ ] and the noncommutative chern - simons action reads @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "the fields @xmath34 are defined on fuzzy 2-sphere @xmath35 and should be considered as @xmath36 matrix - valued , i.e. @xmath37 where @xmath38 are fuzzy spherical harmonics and @xmath39 are chan - paton matrix - valued coefficients .",
    "@xmath40 are generators of the rotations on fuzzy 2-spheres and they act only on fuzzy spherical harmonics @xcite . the noncommutative action @xmath41 was derived from connes spectral triples of the noncommutative geometry and was aimed to describe maxwell theory on fuzzy spheres @xcite .",
    "one can solve the equations of motion derived from the stationery points of ( [ eq : noncommaction ] ) and the solutions describing the dynamics of the branes , i.e. the condensation processes on the brane configuration @xmath42 which results in another configuration @xmath43 .",

    "given another solution corresponding to the @xmath49 one can show that this corresponds to the brane wrapping the @xmath50 sphere and is obtained as the condensed state of @xmath27 point - like branes at the identity of @xmath5 @xcite :    @xmath51    turning to the finite @xmath6 stringy regime of the @xmath5 wzw model one can make use of the techniques of the boundary cft when applied to the analysis of kondo effect @xcite .",
    "it follows that there exists a continuous shift at the level of partition function , between @xmath52 and the interfered sum of characters @xmath53 where @xmath54 ( in the vanishing value of the coupling constant ) and @xmath55 are verlinde fusion rule coefficients . in the case of @xmath27 point - like branes",

    ", one can address the question of brane charges in a direct way .",
    "this is based on the decay rule ( [ eq : stringn - to - n1 ] ) in the supersymmetric wzw @xmath5 model . in this case",
    "we have a shift of the level namely @xmath61 which measures the units of the nsns flux through @xmath62 .",
    "one can see the supersymmetric model as strings moving on @xmath5 with @xmath63 units of nsns flux . from the cft point of view there",
    "exist currents @xmath64 which satisfy @xmath63 level of the kac - moody algebra and free fermionic fields @xmath65 in the adjoint representation of @xmath66 .",
    "however it is possible to redefine the bosonic currents as    @xmath67 which fulfill the current algebra commutation relation at the level @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath68 are the structure constants of @xmath66 .",
    "the fields @xmath65 commute with such currents , thus we have the splitting of the supersymmetric wzw @xmath5 model at level @xmath63 as wzw @xmath5 model at level @xmath6 times the theory of free fermionic fields .",
    "thus there are @xmath26 stable branes wrapping the conjugacy classes numbered by @xmath69 .",
    "the decaying process ( [ eq : stringn - to - n1 ] ) says that placing @xmath27 point - like branes ( each charged by the unit @xmath70 ) at the pole @xmath71 they can decay to the spherical brane @xmath72 wrapping the conjugacy class .",
    "taking more point - like branes to the stack at @xmath71 gives the more distant @xmath25 branes until reaching the opposite pole @xmath73 where we have single point - like brane with the opposite charge @xmath74 .",
    "having identify @xmath26 units of the charge with @xmath74 we arrive at the conclusion that the group of charges is @xmath75 .",
    "more generally the charges of branes on the background @xmath76 with non - vanishing @xmath77 are described by the twisted @xmath78 group @xmath79 ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the case of @xmath5",
    "we get the group of rr charges as above for @xmath80 @xmath81    based on @xcite , the following important observation is in order : _ certain small exotic @xmath0 s generate the group of rr charges of d - branes in the curved background of @xmath2 .",
    "_ this observation is based on the integral classes @xmath82 from which one can construct the exotic @xmath83 as corresponding to the codimension-1 foliation of @xmath4 ( determined by the class @xmath21 ) .",
    "in @xcite we showed that twisted k - theory of @xmath4 by the class @xmath82 can be seen as the effect of the exotic smoothness @xmath83 on the ambient 4-space , when @xmath4 is understood as the part of the boundary of the akbulut cork of @xmath83 .",
    "thus we arrive at the correspondence :    the classification of rr charges of the branes on group manifold background @xmath5 at the level @xmath6 , hence the dynamics of d - branes in @xmath4 in stringy regime , is correlated with exotic smoothness on @xmath0 containing this @xmath84 as the part of the boundary of the akbulut cork .",
    "we can give yet another interpretation of the 4-exoticness which appears on flat @xmath0 in this context .",
    "exotic smoothness of @xmath0 , @xmath83 , determines the collection of stable d - branes on @xmath5 at the level @xmath6 of the wzw model , where @xmath85\\in h^{3}(s^{3},\\mathbb{z})$ ] .",
    "thus , the stringy , finite @xmath6 , level of wzw model characterizes exotic 4-smoothness .",
    "recall that in the case of @xmath86 ( e.g. @xmath3 constant in a flat space , i.e. in @xmath45 limit ) the smooth structure on @xmath0 is the standard one @xcite .",
    "thus the exotic smoothness on @xmath0 translates the 4-curvature to the non - zero h - field on @xmath4 of finite volume in string units .",
    "this is similar to the effect of string field equations relating @xmath87 and @xmath21 as in ( [ eq :",
    "r - h ] ) , though it holds now between different spaces ( @xmath0 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "the group manifold @xmath62 is the only manifold which became relevant so far for the description of small exotic @xmath0 . from the other side it is the only one which appears directly as part of a string background ( namely one generated by ns5-branes ) .",
    "the reason is given by the connection of 4-exotics and string theory as it can be naturally formulated in the geometry of the stack of ns5-branes .",
    "let us briefly describe this string background @xcite .",
    "we consider a configuration of @xmath6 coincident supersymmetric ns5-branes in type ii theory .",
    "the full fivebrane background is ( in string frame )    @xmath88    e^{2\\phi}=g_{s}^{2}f(r)\\\\[4pt ]    f(r)=1+\\frac{k\\alpha'}{r^{2 } } \\\\[4pt ]    h_{ijk}=k\\alpha'\\epsilon_{ijk } \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where @xmath89 are the @xmath90 longitudinal coordinates along ns5-branes referred to by indices @xmath91 , @xmath92 , etc .",

    "this @xmath4 corresponds to the angular coordinates of the transversal @xmath0 .",
    "we see that infinite geometrical , , throat ",
    "@xmath109 , emerges .",
    "the metric of the background ( in the string frame ) thus reads    @xmath110 this background is obtained in the near horizon , @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) , geometry of the stack of @xmath113 ns5-branes in type ii string theory and is in fact a scft on the throat .",
    "the ns5-branes are placed at @xmath111 and string theory is strongly coupled there , @xmath114 . in the opposite limit",
    "@xmath115 , or @xmath116 , gives asymptotically flat 10-space and string theory is weakly coupled in that limit .",
    "this is essentially the chs ( callan , harvey , strominger @xcite ) exact string theory background where @xmath5 wzw model appears at suitable level @xmath6 .",
    "given the chs limiting geometry of @xmath27 ns5-branes we have the 4-dimensional tube @xmath117 .",
    "the volume of @xmath4 in string units is finite and correlated with the number of ns5-branes by @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "we take an exotic @xmath83 for @xmath119=k\\in h^{3}(s^{3},\\mathbb{z})$ ] .",
    "this can be achieved more directly by considering the akbulut cork @xmath120 with the boundary , @xmath121 , the homology 3-sphere . as was shown in @xcite @xmath122",
    "contains @xmath4 such that the codimension-1 foliations of it generates the foliations of @xmath122 .",
    "the foliations in turn are generated by casson handles attached to @xmath14 . thus the attached akbulut cork and casson handle(s ) determine the small exotic smoothness of @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the cobordism classes of codimension-1 foliations of @xmath4 are classified by the godbillon - vey invariants which are elements of @xmath10 . in our case",
    "we deal with integral 3-rd cohomologies @xmath119\\in h^{3}(s^{3},\\mathbb{z})$ ] .",
    "thus , a way of embedding the akbulut cork , for some class of exotic @xmath0 s , in the ambient @xmath0 is determined by the integral classes @xmath123 . taking the above @xmath4 from the boundary of the akbulut cork , as @xmath84 in the string background of @xmath27 ns5-branes we arrive at the following result :    [ th : ns5branes ]    in the geometry of the stack of ns5-branes in type ii superstring theories , adding or subtracting a ns5-brane is correlated with the change of smoothing on transversal @xmath0 .",
    "now the tube @xmath109 of the limiting geometry can be embedded in the ambient standard @xmath0 . taking this @xmath108 as lying in the boundary of the akbulut cork for some exotic smooth @xmath83 ,",
    "the embedding of the tube in this exotic 4-space is determined by the embedding of the akbulut cork . but this embedding is determined by casson handles attached to the cork and corresponds to the integral class @xmath119=k\\in h^{3}(s^{3},\\mathbb{z})$ ] .",
    "thus the background @xmath124 is geometrically realized as @xmath125 .",
    "we propose here a general heuristic rule :    r1 . _ d - branes probing exotic 4-dimensional euclidean space , @xmath83 , times 6-dim .",
    "minkowski spacetime , @xmath126 , are described equivalently by the d - branes of type ii string theory probing the transversal 4-space , @xmath0 , to @xmath6 ns5-branes in the background of these 5-branes . here",
    "h^{3}(s^{3},\\mathbb{z})$ ] .",
    "since @xmath126 appears in both sides of the correspondence we say that _ d - branes explore exotic euclidean @xmath83__. _ _    rule r1 is based on the assumption that various nonstandard smoothings of @xmath0 can be grasped by the effects of @xmath12 .",
    "this follows from the correlation of the classes and 4-exotics as proved in @xcite . following this rule",
    "we can consider many examples of d - branes in the above background ( see e.g. @xcite ) , as referring to 4-exoticness .",
    "furthermore type ii string theory on @xmath124 is given by the scft on the infinite , , throat  of the background , i.e. @xmath117 .",
    "then this theory was proposed to be approachable via holography by using duality .",
    "the holographically dual theory appears to be so called 6-dimensional _ little string theory ( lst ) _",
    "this is a very interesting situation for us since lst was analyzed as having possible experimental signatures at the tev scales after the compactification on torus @xcite . by",

    "we do not deal here with the details and refer the interesting reader to a separate paper devoted to ( flux ) compactification in string theory and exotic 4-smoothness .",
    "but we will present some general remarks here .",
    "lst s are non - local theories without gravity and can be described in the limit @xmath127 in the theory on @xmath6 ns5-branes . in that limit the bulk degrees of freedom decouple , hence gravity does .",
    "this 6-dim .",
    "lst without gravity is holographically dual to the type ii string theory formulated on the background @xmath124 @xcite . from the rule",
    "r1 it follows that lst is referred to exotic @xmath83 and calculations in lst should lead to invariants of the 4-exotics .",
    "the perturbative calculations , however , are hardly performed in lst since the string coupling @xmath128 diverges in the dual string background along the tube , and lst is sensitive on that .",
    "one usually regulates the geometry via chopping the tube .",
    "but the decomposition of the scft @xmath29 on @xmath129 can be performed . here",
    "@xmath130 is a minimal @xmath131 model at the level @xmath6 and @xmath132 is the cartan subalgebra of @xmath5 with the parameter @xmath133 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath6 is crucial at this reformulation since this refers to 4-exotics by theorem [ th : ns5branes ] and the rule r1 .",
    "thus we have the scft @xmath134 instead of the tube @xmath135 .",
    "the chopping of the strong coupling region is now performed by taking the scft @xmath136 instead of @xmath137 which means replacing the background @xmath124 by @xmath138 .",
    "this means , on the level of @xmath6 ns5-branes , the separation of these 5-branes along the transverse circle of radius @xmath139 .",
    "now the double - scale limit of lst is the one when taking both @xmath128 and @xmath139 to zero while @xmath140 remains constant .    following @xcite we can take systems of d4 , d6-branes between separated ns5-branes .",
    "the various expressions like correlation functions can be now calculated perturbatively in the holographically dual 6-dimensional lst theory . besides",
    ", suitable compactifications may refer to the spectra with the tev scale of the standard model of particles .",
    "the dependence on @xmath6 of some of these expressions can be seen as the signature of the existence of exotic structure in the 4-space transversal to the branes .",
    "_ exoticness of the 4-space transversal to the worldvolume of ns5-branes , is reflected in specific perturbative spectra of d - branes when calculated in dual 6-dimensional lst . when compactifying this lst on 2 directions longitudinal to the 5-brane one gets spectra which could be sensitive on transversal exoticness of @xmath0 .",
    "from the point of view of physics , the calculations refer to the tev scale @xcite .",
    "_    the important observation can be made : _ some lst calculations refer not only to holographically dual string theory but also to exotic smoothness on @xmath0_. _ this is the indication that one can try , at least in some cases , to replace higher dimensional string theory effects by 4-dimensional phenomena .",
    "_    this is in fact the reformulation of the rule r1 .",
    "the ns5-branes backgrounds show that string theory computations , , feel  the 4-exoticness .",
    "in this section we want to show that d - branes of string theory , as in the previous sections , are related with exotic smooth @xmath0 s also beyond the semi - classical limit , i.e. in the quantum regime of the theory where one should deal rather with _",

    "the gauge theory on such systems is @xmath572 gauge theory .",
    "no gauge field @xmath14 are present but bosons of the theory consist of 10 scalar fields @xmath175 , @xmath573 and tachyon @xmath180 which are from the adjoint representation of @xmath572 .",

    "_    the above observation opens the possibility to interpret d - branes as spectral triples also in more general non - commutative situations .",
    "the appearance of the atiyah - singer theorem in the context of charges of dp - branes can be understood also quite generally via relation of the charges with k - theory classes and the duality of k - theory with k - homology @xcite .",

    "is isomorphic to k - theory classes :      this is basically since the kernel and cokernel of the continuous family of the fredholm operators on @xmath76 acting on @xmath167 , are vector bundles over @xmath76 .",

    "for a point @xmath620 we have @xmath621 and the index defined via k - theory of the family of fredholm operators ( [ eq : k - theory - fredholm ] ) becomes exactly the index of the fredholm operator ( [ eq : index1 ] ) .",
