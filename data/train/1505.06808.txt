    "these shocks appear much weaker in three - dimensional ( 3d ) calculations , leading to more persistent cpd structures @xcite .",
    "grid - based simulations show that the inflow of gas onto the protoplanet mostly happens in the vertical direction , allowing material to cross the shock front near the hill radius @xcite .",

    "most models show that cpd radii truncate to about 1/3 @xcite or even 1/2 @xcite of the planet s hill radius .",
    "this implies that a jupiter mass planet on a 100  au orbit could bear a cpd with a diameter of 4.57  au .",

    "interestingly , there are no near - ir counterparts for either candidate , supporting the idea that these are in fact accreting gas giants with seds driven by circumplanetary accretion @xcite .",

    "the width of these spectral features may inform on the size of their respective cpds , and ultimately on the mass of the accreting planet via their hill radii .",
    "[ fig : spec ] also shows that the cpd line wings for sph1 and sph2 end in an abrupt shoulder .",

    "all compressive work is radiated away immediately , the adiabatic disk can not cool , reaching temperatues of @xmath12000  k around the cpd .",
    "this causes the hot gas to rapidly fill back the gap preventing a cpd to fully develop ( see second moment map in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] ) , which hinders clear identification of spectral features in an adiabatic flow .",
    "indeed , adiabatic and isothermal disks represent two extrema of the phenomenon that we are modelling .",
    "a second signpost of planet formation arises when the doppler shifted line emission of the circumstellar disk s keplerian pattern sweeps across the cpd location .",
    "the butterfly pattern becomes strongly bent and twisted , while the point - symmetric location at the opposite side of the disk remains undisturbed .",

    "optically thicker than , the  maps still reveal the kinematic bend , even for a 1  @xmath0 planet whose gap is shallower and its  appear optically thick around the cpd .",
    "for sph3 the cpd vicinity is much hotter than in the isothermal cases , producing enhanced  emission ( see bottom inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : radtransfer ] ) .    as noted in section  3 ,",
    "our choice of temperature profile in sph1 and sph2 is inconsistent with the scaling used for the rt calculations .",
    "self - consistency should result in a cpd approximately twice as thick as in the sph , reducing the midplane densities and emitted fluxes by a similar factor .",
    "it is possible that the signatures highlighted in figures  2 and 3 would thus be at lower contrast to the background , but still present at detectable levels as the velocities are largely unaffected .",
    "co freeze out at the cpd s location would be prevented by adding a background temperature to account for accretion radiation feedback @xcite and incident radiation from their environment ( see * ? ? ?",
    "including self - consistent thermal physics in future simulations will settle this discrepancy .      to assess the observability of these kinematic cpd signposts , we performed a second calculation tailored for the protoplanet candidate in hd  100546 , based on the sph2 run .",
