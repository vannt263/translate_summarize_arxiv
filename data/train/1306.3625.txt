    ", then the state of the system is described by the sequence @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of particles in state @xmath6 . from now on we will only consider indistinguishable particles ( bosons ) . if state @xmath6 has energy @xmath7 , then the total energy of the system is @xmath8 .",
    "( here ` energy ' means the energy associated with a given state ; that is , if the state is an eigenfunction of a schrdinger operator , then the energy is the corresponding eigenvalue . )",
    "if the system is in thermal equilibrium , then the boltzmann hypothesis implies that the chance of observing the system in state @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the temperature and @xmath12 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "this is the so - called ` canonical ensemble ' for a system of @xmath0 non - interacting bosons with energy levels @xmath13 .",
    "typically , the @xmath7 s are arranged in increasing order , so that @xmath14 is the energy of the ground state .",
    "building on the work of bose @xcite , einstein @xcite realized that for a system of indistinguishable particles modeled as above , there is a transition temperature below which a macroscopic fraction of the particles settle down in the ground state .",
    "this phenomenon is known as bose - einstein condensation .",
    "the first realization of a bose - einstein condensate was obtained in 1995 @xcite , resulting in an explosion of activity in this field . for modern treatments of the subject and surveys of the physics literature , see e.g.  @xcite . for rigorous mathematical results and further references ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "besides the canonical model described above , there are two other standard approaches to modeling bose - einstein condensation .",
    "the _ grand canonical ensemble _ assumes that the system is allowed to exchange particles with a neighboring particle reservoir .",
    "in other words , the total number of particles is allowed to vary . in the grand canonical ensemble ,",
    "the possible states of the system are all sequences @xmath15 of non - negative integers ( instead of sequences summing to a fixed @xmath0 ) , and the probability that the system is in state @xmath9 is proportional to @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a quantity called the ` chemical potential ' .",
    "note that @xmath17 must be strictly less than @xmath14 for this to be a proper probability measure .",
    "given a temperature @xmath11 and an expected particle number @xmath0 , the chemical potential @xmath17 is determined using the condition that the expected number of particles equals @xmath0 at temperature @xmath11 .    the _ microcanonical ensemble _",
    ", on the other hand , assumes that both the total number of particles as well as the total energy are given ( or given approximately ) , and the state of the system is drawn uniformly at random from all possible states satisfying these two constraints .",
    "it is a general characteristic of physical systems that the three ensembles have similar behavior ( `` equivalence of ensembles '' ) .",
    "however , the physics community realized  surprisingly recently , about twenty years ago  that bose gases exhibit a striking departure from this general rule , in the regime where the condensate appears : the fluctuations of the size of the condensate fraction are of macroscopic size in the grand canonical ensemble , whereas they are microscopic in the other two ensembles .",
    "the problem of condensate fluctuations in the context of modern experiments was brought to the attention of the theoretical physics community by the paper of grossmann and holthaus @xcite .",
    "then , the idea of h.  d.  politzer of treating the condensate as a reservoir of particles for the excited subsystem was used to define the concept of the `` fourth statistical ensemble '' in @xcite .",
    "the formalism defined there soon become a major tool for the determination of fluctuations in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles for a large class of potentials @xcite . for detailed surveys of the above line of work and further references ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite . in the next section",
    ", we present a theorem that gives a mathematically rigorous solution to the problem of understanding the fluctuations of the condensate fraction in the canonical ensemble for trapped non - interacting bose gases .",
    "the main differences between the large body of literature cited above and our work are that ( a ) we have theorems with rigorous proofs , and ( b ) our theorems work for more general potentials than the ones considered in prior work .",
    "an extension of our work to the microcanonical ensemble is the topic of a future paper , soon to be finished .    on the rigorous side",
    ", there is a body of work relating fine properties of bose - einstein condensation with those of random partitions , possibly beginning with a paper of vershik @xcite .",
    "this approach is particularly suitable for studying bose - einstein condensation under mean - field interactions .",
    "some of the notable papers in this direction are @xcite . among other things ,",
    "there are some rigorous results about fluctuations of the condensate in these papers .",
    "this is a more challenging and ambitious direction than what we consider in this paper since it involves interactions .",
    "however the non - interacting system is still important for certain conceptual purposes .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for details .",
    "an accessible introduction to the ideal bose gas and its condensation is in krauth ( * ? ? ?",
