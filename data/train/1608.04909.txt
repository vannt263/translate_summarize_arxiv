    "generation , manipulation and measurement of photonic quantum states are prerequisites for many applications of quantum information processing .",
    "a high visibility hong - ou - mandel  ( hom ) interference  @xcite of photons generated by independent photon sources is an important issue for fulfilling such requirements  @xcite . so far ,",
    "many of such experiments have been performed with photons generated from spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) pumped by ultrafast pulsed lasers  @xcite . in such experiments , the timing synchronization of the photons from the separated sources is achieved by the spectral filtering of the photons such that their coherence time is longer than that of the pump light and the adjustment of the optical path lengths for a high visibility interference . on the other hand , if timing resolutions of the photon detectors is sufficiently shorter than the coherence time of the photons , the temporal indistinguishability of the photons can be guaranteed by the coincidence detection with such a high timing resolution  @xcite . in this case , even when the photons are generated by a cw pump laser , post analysis of the timings of the photon detections allows us to select photons having a sufficient temporal overlap .",
    "one of the advantages of this method is that there is no need to perform the active synchronizations of the photon sources",
    ". such an experiment has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , they performed the experiment of the hom interference between two photons independently prepared by spdc with a cw pump light , and observed a visibility of 0.77 .",
    "however , in order to perform various kinds of applications , such as quantum repeaters  @xcite , quantum relays  @xcite , measurement - device - independent quantum key distribution  ( qkd )  @xcite , and distributed quantum computation  @xcite , a higher visibility will be desirable . in this paper",
    ", we report on a demonstration of such a high - visibility hom interference between two photons in the cw - pumped regime with high - resolution photon detectors . in the experiment",
    ", we introduced an extended method to observe an intrinsic value of the interference visibility .",
    "we observed a visibility of 0.87 @xmath0 0.04 , which clearly exceeds the previous result  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we derived a simple relationship between the visibility of the hom interference and the second order intensity correlation function of the input light and background photons , and confirmed that the experimental results are in a good agreement with the relationship .",
    "we first review the standard method of time - resolved coincidence detection for the hom interference experiments .",
    "then we discuss an extended method that reduces an effect of stray photons or accidental coincidences by shortening a coincidence time window even below the coherence time of signal photons .",
    "let us explain the standard method to observe the hom interference of two independent light pulses . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2pi ] , the light pulses in modes 1 and 2 are mixed by a half beamsplitter  ( hbs ) followed by photon detectors d3 and d4 .",
    "we assume that a relative delay  ( timing difference ) @xmath1 between two incoming light pulses is precisely determined in advance .",
    "the delay line is introduced in mode 2 for the adjustment of @xmath1 .    as is well known , by counting the two - fold coincidence events between d3 and d4 with detection time windows much larger than the pulse duration for various values of @xmath1 , the hom dip will be observed , while the single counts of d3 and d4 take constant values  @xcite",
    ". the visibility of the hom interference is represented by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the two - fold coincidence probabilities with @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , where @xmath7 is chosen to be much larger than the pulse duration of input light .",
    "the two - fold coincidence probability @xmath8 can be understood as follows : as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : window ] , we assume that a common fixed time window of width @xmath9 is adopted for d3 and d4 , regardless of the amount of delay @xmath1 .",
    "let us divide the window in two and denote the two halves by @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "[ fig : window ]  ( a ) and ( b ) show the sketches of the light pulses with @xmath5 and that with @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the light from mode 1 is always detected at the center of @xmath10 , while the one from mode 2 is detected in @xmath10 for @xmath5 and in @xmath11 for @xmath6 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath12 a detection event at d3 in period @xmath10 , which may be caused by the input pulse , stray background photons , or dark counting , and define @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 similarly .",
    "then , the coincidence probability @xmath8 determined in this conventional setup corresponds to the rate of occurrence of event ( @xmath12 or @xmath14 ) and ( @xmath13 or @xmath15 ) .",
    "an underlying assumption in this method is that the contribution of backgrounds should be the same for figs .",
    "[ fig : window ]  ( a ) and [ fig : window ]  ( b ) , which is satisfied if the statistical properties of stray photons are time - invariant .",
    "if background photons are not negligible , shortening the widths of time windows @xmath10 and @xmath11 is favorable . in this case",
    ", each width of the time window may be close to or even much shorter than the signal pulse width  @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : window ]  ( c ) and ( d ) . in this paper , we adopt this regime for suppressing stray photons .",
    "the coincidence probability @xmath8 is calculated from the rate of occurrence of event ( @xmath12 or @xmath14 ) and ( @xmath13 or @xmath15 ) , just as in the conventional setup .",
    "the contribution of stray photons should be the same for figs .",

    "our experimental setup is shown in fig .  [ fig : homsetup ]  ( a ) .",
    "an initial beam from an external cavity diode laser  ( ecdl ) working at 1560  nm with a linewidth of 1.8  khz is frequency doubled by using a periodically - poled lithium niobate waveguide  ( ppln / w )  @xcite .",
    "the frequency of the ecdl is stabilized by the saturated absorption spectroscopy of rubidium atoms .",
    "the obtained cw light at 780  nm is set to be vertically  ( v ) polarized and is coupled to a 40-mm - long and type-0 quasi - phase - matched ppln / w .",
    "it generates non - degenerate photon pairs at 1541  nm and 1580  nm by spdc .",
    "the v - polarized photons at 1541  nm and 1580  nm are separated into different spatial modes by a dichroic mirror  ( dm ) .",
    "the photons at 1541  nm are flipped to horizontal  ( h ) polarization by a half - wave plate  ( hwp ) , and they are coupled to a polarization maintaining fiber  ( pmf ) followed by a fiber - based bragg grating  ( fbg ) .",
    "the photons at 1580 nm are also coupled to a pmf followed by a fbg .",
    "we first characterized our photon pair source by measuring the single counts and the coincidence counts just after the fbgs in fig .",

    "the observed coincidence count rate is @xmath19  counts/(s@xmath20 nm ) and single count rates are @xmath21  counts/(s@xmath20 nm ) for 1541  nm and @xmath22  counts/(s@xmath20 nm ) for 1580  nm .",

    "we estimated @xmath29 just after the ppln / w to be about @xmath30 pairs/(s@xmath20mw@xmath20 nm ) . when we performed the hom experiment described in detail later , we connected the output of the fbgs to the fiber - based optical circuit and set the bandwidths of @xmath16 to be 30  pm and @xmath17 to be 10  pm , respectively .",
    "in addition , we set the detection window to be 80  ps and the pump power to be 2.5  mw .",
    "in this setup , the observed coincidence count rate between detectors d1 and d3 was @xmath31 counts / s .",
    "next , we measured the timing jitter of the overall timing measurement system with superconducting nanowire single - photon detectors  ( snspds )  @xcite . for the measurement of the timing jitter",
    ", we used bandwidths  ( 3  nm ) for @xmath16 and @xmath17 which correspond to the temporal width of 1.2  ps , and measured the arrival time of the picosecond photons by directly connecting the output of the fbgs to the detectors . in this setup , since the temporal width of the photons is sufficiently shorter than the timing jitter of the system , the distribution of arrival time difference of the photons reflects the timing jitter of the system .",

    "after going back to the fhbs , the two photons are split into two paths and they are detected by d3 and d4 .",
    "we note that each of the two photons receives polarization fluctuation in the smf . in the optical circuit ,",
    "such fluctuations are much slower than the round - trip time of the photon propagation in each path and thus the birefringence effect in the smf is automatically compensated after passing through each path by using the fm  @xcite .",
    "we collect the four - fold coincidence events by using a time - digital converter  ( tdc ) .",

    "we consider the reason for the degradation of the observed visibility of the hom interference . in our experiment , since the effect of the timing jitters of the detectors is estimated to be small due to the large coherence time , we only consider the effect of stray photons including multiple pair emission . below",
    "we derive a simple relationship among the visibility and the intensity autocorrelation functions of the signal light pulses and stray photons . for simplicity , we assume that the signal photons and stray photons observed in a time window @xmath10 or @xmath11 are in a single mode .",

    "we characterize the property of stray photons alone by the average photon number @xmath56 and the normalized intensity correlation function @xmath57 .",

    "( [ homvis ] ) is represented by @xmath84 so far , we have assumed that each detector receives only a single mode per window for simplicity .",
    "rather surprisingly , the relation ( [ homvis2 ] ) still holds when detectors also receives stray photons in other modes , as long as the statistical independence among different modes is fulfilled ( see supplemental material ) . from the experimental results of @xmath85 and @xmath86 , we obtain @xmath87 , which is in good agreement with the observed visibility of 0.87 @xmath0 0.04 within a margin of error .",
    "these results indicate that the degradation of the visibility is mainly caused by stray photons .",
    "since the main cause of the stray photons is the accidental emission of photon pairs from spdc , a higher visibility will be obtained by using a lower pump power and shorter timing selection for the photon detection .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed an experiment of the hom interference between two photons produced by the two independent spdc processes with cw pump light . the observed",
    "visibility is 0.87 @xmath0 0.04 , which is much higher than 0.77 observed in ref .",
    "we also presented a simple relation between the visibility and the second order intensity correlation function , and showed that it holds with a good approximation in this experiment .",
    "the relation is convenient for the estimation of the possible visibility from the second order intensity correlation functions of the various input light sources",
