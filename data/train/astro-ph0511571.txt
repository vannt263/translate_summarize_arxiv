    "deep multiwavelength surveys are progressively sheding light on the history of galaxy evolution since very high redshifts . from new surveys in the ultraviolet regime ( e.g. martin et al . 2005 ) to the latest ir , sub - millimetre and radio campaigns ( e.g. werner et al . 2004 ; dunlop 2005 ; condon et al .",
    "2003 ) , the advent of numerous datasets is enhancing our understanding of when galaxies were formed and how they evolved through cosmic time .",
    "uv / optical observations can unveil the sources of stellar emission but are limited to detect unobscured systems , missing an important fraction of the galaxies with on - going star formation .",
    "ir and longer - wavelength surveys provide an unbiased way of studying star - forming systems , but are insensitive to galaxies with little or no dust content . near - ir",
    "observations , on the contrary , appear as one of the most suitable methods for making a complete census of galaxy populations , as they are sensitive to the stellar emission from both young and old galaxies , and are also relatively unaffected by the presence of dust .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath15 band is the most efficient tracer of the stellar mass content of the universe .",
    "recent studies of near - ir - selected galaxies allowed for a rapid progress in setting different constraints on the history of galaxy formation ( cimatti et al .",
    "2002 ; daddi et al .",
    "2003 ; caputi et al .",
    "2004 ; caputi et al . 2005a ; among others ) and , in particular , on the evolution of the stellar mass content of the universe with redshift ( dickinson et al . 2003",
    "; fontana et al . 2004 ; glazebrook et al . 2004 ; caputi et al . 2005a ; drory et al . 2005 ) .",
    "it is now recognised that , although more than a half of the stellar mass has been formed at redshifts @xmath16 $ \\sim$}}~}1.5 $ ] , near - ir - selected galaxies are already present before at least redshifts @xmath17 and contain a significant fraction of the stellar mass observed at redshift @xmath5 .",
    "however , one of the main problems of existing near - ir surveys is that , when sufficiently deep , they are usually restricted to small areas of the sky , making the results prone to large error bars due to cosmic variance . also , the lack of statistics prevents refined studies of galaxy evolution , where trends for different near - ir sub - populations can be individually investigated .",
    "the goods project ( giavalisco et al .  2004 ) is a public program of multiwavelength observations which is now close to completion .",
    "the data sets are kindly released to the astronomical community in a fully reduced mode . as part of the goods project , @xmath18 of the cdfs",

    "in addition , the goods project includes deep near - ir imaging taken with the infrared spectrometer and array camera ( isaac ) on the ` antu ' very large telescope ( antu - vlt ) . a first release of the european southern observatory ( eso ) imaging survey ( goods / eis v0.5 release ) provided data in the @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 bands for @xmath25 of the goods / cdfs field . in this sub - region , roche , dunlop & almaini  ( 2003 ) selected a deep sample of extremely red galaxies ( ergs ) with @xmath26 ( vega ) , whose redshift distribution and luminosity evolution were studied by caputi et al .",
    "a detailed comparison of the properties of ergs with other @xmath2-selected galaxies was presented by caputi et al .",

    ", however , new datasets have been made public within the goods project , increasing the coverage in wavelength and area of the goods / cdfs .",

    "the infrared array camera ( irac ) on board the spitzer space telescope imaged this field at @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the availability of these data allows one to map the rest - frame @xmath2-band light up to redshifts @xmath17 .    in this work , we take advantage of the further wavelength and area coverage of the goods / cdfs , in conjunction with the information provided by the latest released spectroscopic and combo17 data , to set tighter constraints on the properties and evolution of @xmath2-selected galaxies . the layout of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , in section [ sec_sample ] , we present the sample selection and give details on the multiwavelength photometry . in section [ sec_redsh ] , we explain the technique we applied to construct an optimised redshift catalogue for our galaxy sample and show the resulting redshift distribution . in section [ sec_lf ]",
    ", we present the rest - frame @xmath2-band luminosity function ( lf ) for our sample of @xmath2-selected galaxies . in section [ sec_mass ] , we discuss several aspects of the evolution of different mass systems . in section [ sec_nearir ] , we explore additional hints from the study of the purely near - ir colours of our galaxies . finally , in section [ sec_conc ] we present some concluding remarks .",
    "we adopt throughout a cosmology with @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf over stellar masses @xmath34 is assumed , unless where otherwise stated .",
    "we used the public deep isaac @xmath2-band images in the goods / eis v1.0 release to select a catalogue of @xmath0 ( vega ) sources in 131 arcmin@xmath35 of the goods / cdfs .",
    "this new release is composed of 21 maps which cover more than twice the area of the goods / eis v0.5 release .",
    "in addition , further improvements have been applied to the v1.0 imaging , such as a revised data reduction technique and a uniform photometric calibration of the maps across the entire field .",
    "we performed the source extraction using the public code sextractor ( bertin & arnouts , 1996 ) on the @xmath2-band images .",
    "we cut the resulting catalogue at a magnitude @xmath36 , a limit half a magnitude brighter than the cut we used to select our @xmath2 sample in caputi et al .",
    "( 2005a ) .",
    "several reasons justify our new magnitude limit .",
    "first , a few of the additional maps in the v1.0 release have lower exposure times than the average exposure times of the maps composing the v0.5 release .",
    "second , this new limit constitutes an adequate balance between having access to galaxies up to very high redshifts and requiring for our catalogue to have a high level of completeness .",
    "the completeness levels of our v1.0 sample are very similar to those estimated for the v0.5 sample by caputi et al .",
    "( 2005a ) : 100% , 90% and 86% for @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "finally , our new sample has been selected having in mind the possibility of a complete quantitative study of galaxy morphology , only possible for high signal - to - noise objects .",
    "the results of the latter will be presented in a companion paper ( mclure et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "our total v1.0 @xmath0 sample consists of 3184 sources .",
    "we measured multiwavelength photometry for our @xmath2-selected galaxies in order to model their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , as we shall explain in section [ sec_redsh ] .",
    "we ran sextractor in ` double - image mode ' to perform aperture photometry on the goods / eis v1.0 @xmath22-band images , centred at the position of the @xmath2-band extracted sources .",
    "we measured magnitudes in an aperture size of 2.83-arcsec diameter for all the objects , to coincide with one of the aperture sizes used to construct the public goods / cdfs acs catalogues .",
    "the latter have been constructed running sextractor on the @xmath21-band images , and making ` double - image mode ' runs to perform photometry in the @xmath3 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 bands .",
    "we looked for counterparts of our @xmath0 ( vega ) sources in the acs catalogues and adopted the corresponding 2.83-arcsec diameter aperture magnitudes in each of the four acs passbands .",
    "a 2.83-arcsec diameter aperture is sufficient to collect all the flux of the vast majority ( @xmath4090% ) of our galaxies in the different optical / near - ir passbands . even in the @xmath2 band ,",

    "deep spitzer / irac imaging for the goods / cdfs is now also publicly available , covering the wavelength range @xmath44 to @xmath45 . at the time of writing ,",
    "only the first epoch of irac goods / cdfs data had been released .",
    "this first epoch includes @xmath44 and @xmath46 images for @xmath47 of the area of the goods / cdfs and @xmath4 and @xmath45 images for another @xmath47 of this area , in such a way that only @xmath48 of the field have data in the four irac passbands .",
    "we ran sextractor on the @xmath44 and @xmath4 images and looked for counterparts of the @xmath2-band sources in a matching radius of 1.2 arcsec .",
    "we restricted the photometry to only the first two irac channels , as the templates we used for the galaxy sed fitting lose accuracy or do not cover wavelengths beyond @xmath49 .",
    "we measured magnitudes in 2.83-arcsec diameter apertures .",
    "however , the point - spread function ( psf ) of the irac images is much larger than the characteristic psf of the isaac and acs images : the mean full - width half maximum ( fwhm ) of the irac @xmath44 psf is 1.66 arcsec ( fazio et al .",
    "2004 ) , in comparison with 0.4 arcsec and 0.1 arcsec for the @xmath2 and @xmath21 bands in the isaac and acs instruments , respectively .",
    "thus , a 2.83-arcsec diameter aperture is insufficient to encompass the magnitudes measured in the irac bands with the magnitudes obtained in equivalent apertures on the acs and isaac images .",
    "we computed aperture corrections for the magnitudes measured on the irac images studying the curve of growth of isolated stars in the field .",
    "we determined aperture corrections of 0.50 and 0.55 magnitudes for the 2.83-arcsec - diameter aperture magnitudes in the @xmath44 and the @xmath4 bands , respectively .    to clean our catalogues for stars and active galaxies , we applied criteria somewhat more strict than those implemented by caputi et al .",
    "( 2005a ) .",
    "we cleaned our catalogues for stars using the sextractor stellarity parameter ` class_star ' , as measured on the acs @xmath21 images .",
    "to separate active galaxies , we looked for counterparts of our @xmath0 sources in the public x - ray catalogues available for the cdfs ( szokoly et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "222/3184 sources of our initial catalogue had class_star@xmath430.8 .",
    "figure  [ colstar ] shows the location of these 222 sources in a colour - color diagram , in comparison to the remaining sources in the catalogue .",
    "we see that the majority of the objects with class_star@xmath430.8 occupy a clearly separated region in this plot , typically displaying colours @xmath50 $ \\sim$}}~}1.1 $ ] ( vega )",
    ". however , we find 6 outliers in the colour - colour diagram , which we studied on a case - by - case basis .",
    "4 out of these 6 outliers are x - ray classified as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) or quasi - stellar objects ( qso ) .",
    "the remaining 2 are not detected in the x - rays , but their seds can not be satisfactorily fitted by hyperz ( bolzonella , miralles & pell , 2000 ) with any of the templates in the gissel98 library ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) , so they are likely to be also stars or agn / qso . as a consequence , we excluded the 222 sources with class_star@xmath430.8 from our sample .    on the other hand , we found that 142/3184 of our @xmath2 sources were detected in the x - rays .",
    "however , in principle , the fact that a galaxy is classified as active in the x - rays does not necessarily imply that its optical - to - near - ir sed is dominated by an active nucleus . to determine which x - ray - detected @xmath2 sources had to be excluded from our catalogue , we modelled their seds using the templates in the gissel98 library of hyperz .",
    "the gissel98 library contains a wide range of synthetic seds based on stellar spectra but no power - law sed template .",
    "we determined that the seds of 57/142 x - ray - detected @xmath2 sources could not be satisfactorily fitted by any template in the gissel98 library , so we excluded these 57 objects from our catalogue , as it is likely that their optical / near - ir light is at least partially contaminated by an active nucleus component .",
    "5 additional x - ray - detected @xmath0 sources did not have either a satisfactory fit of their seds , but they already had been excluded on the basis of the stellarity parameter criterion . in summary , our final @xmath0 source catalogue consisted of 2905 galaxies .",
    "other no - x - ray - detected active galaxies could still be present in our final galaxy catalog .",
    "another characteristic allowing to identify active galaxies is the power - law shape of their seds from the uv / optical through the ir regimes .",
    "thus , to investigate the presence of additional contaminating sources within our sample , we cross - correlated our galaxies with the catalogue of @xmath51-selected ir power - law sources in the cdfs constructed by alonso - herrero et al .",
    "( 2005 ) . within our sample",

    "we remark , however , that we do not directly see these intermediate and low luminosity objects at high redshifts , given the limits of our survey .",
    "we only extrapolate this behaviour from the lf obtained through the ml analysis , which assumes the validity of a schechter function for the description of the lf at all redshifts .",
    "thus , two alternative conclusions can be extracted from this result : 1 ) a significant fraction of low and intermediate luminosity objects are created between @xmath98 and @xmath5 , or 2 ) at least as many low luminosity objects are present at high as at low redshifts , and our assumptions for the computation of the lf with the ml analysis are not valid to describe the faint - end of the lf at high redshifts .",
    "the direct access to low luminosity objects at high redshifts through deeper surveys is necessary to conclusively prove the behaviour of the faint - end of the lf .    in hierarchical models ,",
    "the creation of new objects is the consequence of the production of galaxy mergers and subsequent triggering of star formation .",
    "very recently , conselice ( 2005 ) found that the fraction of mergers in faint and low mass galaxies peaked at lower redshifts than for higher luminosity and more massive galaxies .",
    "this result appears to be consistent with the presence of luminous galaxies at high redshifts @xmath103 , as they would be produced from mergers at these or even higher redshifts .",
    "the decline in the number of intermediate luminosity objects at high redshifts that we extrapolate from the ml analysis would also be consistent with the fact that a significant fraction of them form through mergers at later times .",
    "however , the differential redshift peak observed for mergers of different mass and luminosity still can not decide on the formation epoch of all the lowest luminosity objects , and the two hypotheses discussed above could still be possible . at redshifts",

    "the significant decrease of the bright end ( @xmath104 ) of the lf from redshifts @xmath97 to @xmath5 is probably indicating that the most massive galaxies present at @xmath105 must have finished the construction of the bulk of their stars by this redshift , and mainly fade out all the way through redshift @xmath5 ( cf .",

    "we observe that the @xmath175)$ ] colours increase up to redshift @xmath182 , and the colour - redshift relation becomes tighter with increasing stellar mass .",
    "in contrast , the colour dispersion becomes quite large above that redshift , where the observed near - ir bands start to map the rest - frame optical bands .",
    "this colour dispersion is in part due to larger photometry uncertainties , but it is probably also an indication of a wide variety of star - formation histories and dust extinction in these galaxies .",
    "figure  [ ksm45model ] shows an amplified version of the high - mass panel in figure  [ ksm45comp ] .",
    "we added for comparison the modelled evolution of the observed @xmath175)$ ] colours for galaxies formed in a single burst at redshifts @xmath125 and @xmath124 , both with no dust and passive evolution thereafter . some interesting conclusions can be extracted from the analysis of this figure .",
    "firstly , it is quite evident that the observed near - ir colours of many massive galaxies at high redshifts ( @xmath89 $ \\sim$}}~}1.5 $ ] ) can not be explained without considerable amounts of dust ( cf . also caputi et al .",
    "2004 ) . independently of the formation redshift ,",
    "the colours of a passively - evolving single burst are not sufficient to reproduce the red observer - frame near - ir colours of massive galaxies .",
    "we conclude , then , that purely passive galaxies should be a minority at high redshifts .",
    "secondly , the colours observed at lower redshifts ( @xmath16 $ \\sim$}}~}1.5 $ ] ) indicate that the near - ir light of @xmath8 galaxies must be dominated by evolved stellar populations . a similar conclusion has been obtained from the analysis of the @xmath121 colours of these systems .",
    "we note that the tight colour - redshift relation observed for high - mass galaxies at @xmath16 $ \\sim$}}~}1.5 - 2.0 $ ] does not imply a common formation redshift or star - formation history .",
    "for instance , as we mentioned in section  [ sec_masscol ] , some of these galaxies are bright mid - ir sources , while others are not , suggesting a wide variety of on - going star - formation rates ( caputi et al .",
    "2005b , c ) . however , and in contrast to what is progressively observed in less massive systems , all the plausible new star - formation in very massive galaxies at low redshifts could have a minor impact on their overall properties and , in particular , on their sed colours .",

    "the solid and dotted - dashed lines show the modelled evolution of the @xmath183)$ ] colours for galaxies formed in an instantaneous burst at redshift @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively , both with no dust and passive evolution thereafter . ]",
    "with the goods project close to completion , in this work we have been able to set tighter constraints on the evolution of near - ir - selected galaxies in the goods / cdfs field .",
    "we took advantage of the latest available very deep and homogeneous multiwavelength photometry , in conjunction with the information provided by complementary spectroscopic programs and the combo17 campaign , to construct an optimised redshift catalogue for the @xmath0 galaxies in the goods - south field .",
    "based on this catalogue , we performed a detailed analysis of galaxy luminosity and mass evolution up to very high redshifts @xmath184 .",
    "the incorporation of the spitzer / irac data at @xmath185 and @xmath186 allowed us to compute rest - frame @xmath2-band luminosities and stellar masses with considerably smaller extrapolations than those applied in caputi et al .",
    "( 2005a ) . in spite of this important difference",
    ", we note that most of the main conclusions obtained by caputi et al .",
    "( 2005a ) have been confirmed by this work .",
    "the addition of irac data did not produce any overall change in the derived galaxy luminosities and stellar masses .",
    "other authors also have concluded that the use of irac data produced a minor impact on the derived galaxy stellar masses , when other shorter optical / near - ir multiwavelength data are also available ( e.g. shapley et al . 2005 ) .    from the modelling of the evolution of the @xmath2-band luminosities",
    ", we determined that the characteristic magnitude @xmath93 of the rest - frame @xmath2-band lf significantly brightens from redshifts @xmath5 to @xmath98 .",
    "this is simultaneously produced with a decrease in the total density of objects , so we conclude that the @xmath2-band lf has both a substantial luminosity and density evolution with redshift .",
    "the characteristics of this evolution reveal some important aspects of the sequence of galaxy formation .",
    "for instance , that most of the brightest galaxies are assembled at high redshifts ( @xmath89 $ \\sim$}}~}1 $ ] ) , while the creation of a substantial number of intermediate - to - low luminosity objects might continue down to low redshifts ( although the latter will need to be confirmed by future deeper surveys , which have direct access to low - luminosity objects at high redshifts ) .    we have also studied the very high stellar - mass end ( @xmath132 ) of galaxy evolution .",
    "we found that most of these very massive systems in our sample have been formed in the @xmath187-period of time between redshifts @xmath141 and @xmath148 , although a significant fraction ( up to @xmath13% ) appear to have been in place before redshift @xmath122 .",
    "very recently , from the cross - correlation of our @xmath0 galaxy sample with the spitzer/@xmath51 galaxies in the same field , caputi et al .",
    "( 2005b ) found that the most - intense star - forming galaxies at redshifts @xmath188 are mainly massive ( @xmath189 ) galaxies .",
    "this is also the main epoch of flourish of submillimetre galaxies ( chapman et al .",
    "2005 ) , which presumably are progenitors of the most massive local galaxies ( e.g. stevens et al .",
    "thus , this period appears to be critical to understand the formation and evolution of the bulk of the most massive systems present in the local universe .",
    "theoretical models of galaxy formation in their current status are not completely able to account for all of these results .",
    "several different clues have been proposed in recent works to try to improve the agreement of the models with the data at high redshifts , including e.g. the effects of qso and supernova feedback ( granato et al .",
    "2004 ; cirasuolo et al .",
    "2005 ) , the adoption of an alternative imf ( baugh et al .",
    "2005 ) or the use of hydrodynamical models ( nagamine et al .",
    "however , the discrepancies are not produced by the specific recipes used by theoretical models to account for star formation , but seem to lie at the more fundamental level of hierarchical model predictions .",
    "hierarchical models do not seem to be able to reproduce the whole of observational properties from the local universe to high redshifts .",
    "a likely alternative to this problem is the invalidity of a universal imf when deriving stellar masses from the observed luminosities .",
    "a definitive comprehension of the main epoch of very massive galaxy formation , as well as the determination of the initial distribution of stars in these systems , still constitutes a major challenge from both the observational and theoretical points of view .",
