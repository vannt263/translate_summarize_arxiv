    "on the other hand , all the physical properties of our regular solution , such as @xmath90 and @xmath16 $ ] are bounded , so this may mean that we do not require quantum gravity to obtain non - singular solutions in gravity theory .    in the range @xmath88 , the strong energy condition @xmath94 or @xmath124 for a null or timelike vector @xmath125",

    "the hawking - penrose theorems  @xcite state that if both the weak and strong energy conditions for matter are satisfied and there exists an apparent event horizon , then the static spherically symmetric solution in gr must be singular .",
    "in particular , the focussing of null and time - like geodesics produces an event horizon at @xmath3 and an essential singularity at @xmath77 . since our non - singular static spherically symmetric metric violates the weak energy condition for @xmath127 , we do not contradict the hawking - penrose theorems . because of the absence of an event horizon _ our exterior solution does not possess a trapped surface _ and the geodesics of the spacetime metric are complete  @xcite .",
    "the violation of the weak energy condition signals that the _ classical _ non - singular solution fails for @xmath128 . as @xmath5 quantum physics must intervene to preserve the non - singular solution and prevent the existence of an event horizon and an essential singularity at @xmath77 .    if we add ordinary matter density @xmath129 to the right - hand side of our field equations : @xmath130 then we observe that the non - singular metric solutions @xmath48 and @xmath47 and the potential @xmath131 $ ] only depend on m through the schwarzschild radius @xmath8 . therefore , as mass @xmath132",
    "is added : @xmath133 the size of the repulsive potential barrier and the negative contribution of @xmath90 increase and continue to maintain a stable non - singular metric .",
    "thus , the scalar field acts as an _ effective , quantum exotic matter - energy _ that prevents the existence of an essential singularity in the metric at @xmath77 and the formation of a black hole event horizon .",
    "we have proposed an exterior non - singular static spherically symmetric solution for einstein - scalar field gravity .",
    "the scalar field allows for negative density @xmath90 and the potential @xmath16 $ ] is repulsive as a function of @xmath74 and @xmath134 .",
    "when the nuclear fuel burns out in cores of stars , then in standard gr the star can collapse to zero radius and form an event horizon with an essential singularity at @xmath77 .",
    "the fermi pressure at the core of a collapsed star caused by the degenerate electron and neutron gas and pauli s exclusion principle stabilizes white dwarfs and neutron stars , respectively . for the stable white dwarfs and neutron stars the chandrasekhar mass limits are : @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "when the mass of the star satisfies @xmath137 , then according to the singular solutions of gr the star collapses to a black hole .",
    "however , for our non - singular solution , even when the star has a mass @xmath137 , the effective quantum field density @xmath138 as @xmath5 and the repulsive potential @xmath16 $ ] prevents the star from forming a singularity at @xmath77 and a black hole event horizon . at the core of the collapsed star the density of negative field energy @xmath90 can be sufficiently large to prevent the star from collapsing to a black hole as the mass @xmath134 is increased .",
    "thus , if an effective matter - energy @xmath90 dominates as @xmath5 , then we can expect that at the core of a compact star the energy density @xmath90 can produce enough `` antigravity '' to form a stable `` dark grey '' or `` black '' star , even as we continue to increase the ordinary matter @xmath134 for the star .",
    "an important issue justifying further investigation is whether a non - singular collapsed dark grey star is stable .",
    "the non - singular solution must also be extended to the case of a rotating grey or black star .",
    "we can speculate that the scalar @xmath15 field energy permeates all of spacetime as a form of `` quintessence '' .",
    "this would mean that the vacuum field equations in gr : @xmath139 are never fulfilled and that if our potential @xmath16 $ ] is valid for a collapsed star , then black holes as described by the schwarzschild solution do not exist in nature .",
    "our classical solution to einstein - scalar - tensor gravity is non - singular throughout spacetime with bounded curvature invariant @xmath140 , @xmath90 , @xmath141 , and @xmath16 $ ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that @xmath90 becomes negative as @xmath5 could signal the need for quantum gravity at short distances to yield a solution that is regular everywhere in spacetime .    because our static spherically symmetric solution does not possess a black hole event horizon ,",
    "the compact star will only radiate `` normal '' radiation .",
    "this radiation may be so small that the star appears to an outside observer to be `` black '' . since hawking radiation",
    "is intimately associated with a black hole event horizon in the schwarzschild solution of gr and such an event horizon is absent in our exterior regular solution , then our dark grey star does not have an information loss problem .",
