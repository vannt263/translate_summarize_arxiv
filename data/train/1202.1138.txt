    "a detailed comparison between different mass estimators is given in k09 . in the present analysis ,",
    "the near - infrared data ( 3.6@xmath45 m ) of spitzer / irac are available for most of the sample galaxies ( 96 percent ) , so that sed fitting is reasonably reliable for the photometry at rest-@xmath27 ( @xmath46 m ) out to redshift @xmath223 .",
    "we assume that the size of the stellar system in galaxies is represented by the size measured on @xmath4-band images , which are the rest - frame optical to near - infrared wavelengths at @xmath29 .",

    "considering possible effects on the size and mass estimates , we discard x - ray sources in what follows .",
    "as the definition of galaxy size , most previous studies have used the scale length ( @xmath49 ) , obtained by fitting the srsic profile ( srsic 1968 ) to galaxy images .",
    "the accuracy of the scale length strongly depends on image quality and depth of observations . for bright galaxies ,",
    "reliable galaxy sizes can be measured from ground - based data ( trujillo et al .",
    "2006 ; franx et al .",
    "2008 ; williams et al .",
    "2010 ) . on the other hand , it is crucial to take an accurate measure of the profile for small objects near the resolution limit .",
    "in fact , konishi et al . (",
    "2011 ) applied two dimensional fitting for the present sample to obtain srsic indexes with a single component for a morphological study of mods galaxies .",
    "however , they found that reliable fitting was successful only for comparatively massive galaxies ( @xmath26 m@xmath7 ) at @xmath11 and very bright galaxies ( @xmath50 ) at higher redshift .",
    "the resolution of fwhm @xmath51 arcsec like the present sample would not allow reliable fitting with srsic profile to fainter galaxies .",
    "srsic parameters are sometimes degenerated between @xmath52 and @xmath49 , which depends on the surface - brightness limit of the images ( e.g. , mancini et al . 2010 ; stott et al . 2011 ) , so that the reliable fitting would be difficult for faint galaxies . moreover high - redshift galaxies exhibit a wide range of disturbed morphologies ( e.g. , kajisawa & yamada 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , the fitting for less massive galaxies at high redshift could also be strongly influenced by their more amorphous features in the shape .",
    "in addition , we must take into account that we are observing a mix of galaxy morphologies .",
    "as such , we define the half - light radius ( @xmath53 ) as the radius of a circular aperture , which encircles half the @xmath4-band light emitted from galaxies . as we here focus not just on massive ( or bright ) galaxies , but also on less massive galaxies up to @xmath10 , we prefer @xmath54 to @xmath49 for the study of the structural parameters .",
    "if a galaxy profile extends to infinity , @xmath49 encloses half the flux in the srsic profile .",
    "however , as galaxies are supposed to have an edge at several times the scale length , @xmath49 does not always mean half - light radius .",
    "therefore , in general , @xmath53 is smaller than @xmath49 . in the same way",
    ", we define 90 percent - light radius @xmath55 .",
    "the 90-percent radius will give us more information at outer region of galaxies , where the size would be more influenced by merging effect .",

    "few spectroscopic data were available for stars fainter than @xmath57 in the present region , we examined the reliability of @xmath54 using artificial stars .",
    "the artefacts were convolved with a moffat point spread function ( @xmath58 and fwhm=0.5 arcsec in the deep field and 0.6 arcsec in the wide field ) , and then buried in images as noisy as those of the deep and wide fields .",

    "we define galaxies smaller than @xmath59 in the wide field @xmath60 in the deep field as unresolved galaxies .",
    "we first study the reliability of the galaxy size .",
    "seeing and background noise strongly affect the observed @xmath54 and @xmath55 , especially for faint or small galaxies . to examine the effect on the size estimate , we generated mock galaxies with a 1/4-law or exponential profile extending to 3 times scale length .",
    "the images are then convolved with a moffat point spread function ( @xmath58 and fwhm=0.5 arcsec in the deep field and 0.6 arcsec in the wide field ) , and buried in the simulated noise image .",

    "[ fig - mockr90r50 ] .",
    "seeing and noise seriously change the observed radii specifically for galaxies with a 1/4-law profile . the observed @xmath53 is significantly smaller than the intrinsic values in general .",
    "the effect is stronger for fainter 1/4-law galaxies , whereas the effect is much smaller for exponential galaxies .",
    "the apparent smaller size than the intrinsic size would be due to the fact that the faint and large envelope of 1/4-law galaxies is hidden in background noise .",
    "we should be aware of this effect if the observation is not deep enough for early - type galaxies ( see also hopkins et al . 2009b ; mancini et al .",
    "the effect will be discussed in more detail in the following section . it is noted that williams et al .",
    "( 2010 ) claimed no systematic effects on @xmath49 for @xmath61 , using the shallower mods images .",
    "the radii , @xmath53 and @xmath56 , for small galaxies are affected by smearing due to seeing effect and the effect depends on galaxy morphology and size .",
    "therefore , we obtained eq . 1 to correct the size effect by fitting the deviation of the size as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - mockr90r50 ] ( dash line ) . however , it is hard to examine the shapes of the present small or high-@xmath28 galaxies , so that we do not correct the effect which depends on morphology .",

    "observed magnitudes are fainter by @xmath64 mag for 1/4-law galaxies , while the effect is much smaller for exponential galaxies .",
    "these results suggest that shallower observations tend to more underestimate size and flux ( therefore , stellar mass ) .",
    "we discuss later the influence on the results due to the systematic errors .              using photometric ( or spectroscopic , if available ) redshift data , @xmath53 and @xmath56 in arcsec are converted to the physical size in kpc ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) .",
    "the photo-@xmath28 accuracy of the present sample is reasonably good , @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) ( k11 ) , so that we expect no serious influence on our result due to the photo-@xmath28 error .",

    "( 2003 ) , although our definition of half - light radius is different from that of shen et al .",
    "it should be noted that it would be difficult to discuss the consistency for massive early - type galaxies because of the small number of such galaxies in our sample .    since our image quality is not high enough for classifying the galaxies into morphological classes at high redshifts , we divided the samples into quiescent and star - forming galaxy groups using a two - color diagnostic plot of rest - frame @xmath67 and @xmath68 colors ( williams et al . 2009 ) .",

    "<S> we present scaling relations between stellar - mass ( @xmath0 ) and the size of galaxies at @xmath1 for half- ( @xmath2 ) and 90 percent - light ( @xmath3 ) radii , using a deep @xmath4-band selected catalogue taken with the subaru telescope and moircs in the goods - north region . </S>",
    "<S> the logarithmic slope @xmath5 is independent of redshift in a wide mass range of @xmath6 m@xmath7 , irrespective of galaxy populations ( star - forming , quiescent ) . the offset change is @xmath8 percent . </S>",
    "<S> provided that optical light in the rest frame traces the stellar mass of galaxies , the universal relation demonstrates that the stellar mass was built up in galaxies over their cosmic histories in a similar manner on average irrelevant to galaxy mass . </S>",
    "<S> the small offset in each stellar mass bin from the universal relation shows weak size evolution at a given mass . there is a moderate increase of 3050 percent for @xmath2 and @xmath3 for less massive galaxies ( @xmath9 m@xmath7 ) from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , </S>",
    "<S> while the sizes remains unchanged or slightly decrease towards @xmath12 . for massive galaxies ( @xmath13 m@xmath7 ) , the evolution is @xmath14 % increase in @xmath3 from @xmath10 to @xmath12 , though that in @xmath2 is weaker . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of compactness factor , @xmath15 , which becomes smaller at lower redshift , is suggestive of minor merging effect in the outer envelope of massive galaxies .    </S>",
