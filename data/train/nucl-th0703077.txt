    "for instance , using the calorimetry of the hot quasi - projectile nuclei formed in the damped nucleus - nucleus collisions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite for a review of related methods ) , thermodynamical observables of the fragmenting system such as temperature and chemical potential were extracted and a set of correlated signals of the isospin - asymmetric liquid - gas phase transition was observed . on the other hand , various properties of the observed fragments can be interpreted as signals of criticality @xcite , thus indicating an underlying second order phase transition .",
    "the phase diagram at sub - saturation densities appears to be rather complex and detailed investigations are needed for clarification .",
    "the recent experimental studies of the nucleus - nucleus collisions at ultrarelativistic energies provide vast amount of experimental observations which can be interpreted as signals of production and decomposition of the new state of matter with deconfined quarks , called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "such matter exhibits many unique properties such as nearly perfect fluid behavior @xcite and strong medium modification of high - energy particles with a typical mach cone behavior @xcite .",
    "one of the phenomena not yet understood there is the so - called `` hbt puzzle '' @xcite , an unexpected behavior of the source radii extracted from particle - particle correlations , which appear to be almost isotropic , in contrast with intense elliptic flow observed in such collisions .",
    "it was suggested that spatial inhomogeneity ( typically in the form of qgp droplets ) can play a crucial role in its explanation @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of formation of such inhomogeneity is one of the interesting open questions .    in the present work ,",
    "the mechanism of a phase transition is investigated as a phenomenon reflecting the properties of the underlying interaction .",
    "a modified van der waals equation of state is used for the nuclear medium at sub - saturation densities and the role of isospin asymmetry will be investigated within the limitation following from the evolution of an isolated system .",
    "an analogous treatment is used for schematic description of the system undergoing deconfinement - confinement phase transition .    .",
    "the lines represent isotherms with temperatures increasing with the step 2.5 mev , starting at zero . ,",
    "the liquid - gas phase transition in the nuclear matter is supposed to occur after nuclear matter expands and medium becomes unstable toward density fluctuations .",
    "the process as initially suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite was supposed to be analogous to liquid - gas phase transitions in real gases , which is typically described by the van der waals equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "however , unlike the van der waals gas , nuclear matter is a two - component system and it thus possesses an additional degree of freedom related to proton and neutron concentrations .",
    "additional energy term representing the symmetry energy has to be taken into account . under assumption that the symmetry energy decreases with density , it can be favorable for the expanding system to store the excess of neutrons ( protons ) into a dilute phase and thus isospin - asymmetric liquid - gas phase transition can occur @xcite .",
    "however , the expanding nuclear system is isolated and no heat can be transferred into or out of the system and a typical picture of phase transition under conditions of phase equilibrium , as represented by the well - known maxwell construction , is not relevant due to necessity to transfer latent heat into or out of the system .    in order to study the mechanism of isospin asymmetric liquid - gas phase transition in the isolated nuclear system",

    "since the system is thermally isolated , the expansion of the system is an adiabatic process .",
    "the entropy does not change during system evolution and assuming that the heat capacity @xmath7 is constant , the following expression for temperature as a function of density    @xmath8    can be derived , where @xmath9 is the temperature projected to saturation density @xmath10 .",

    "the resulting phase diagram constructed using the pressure and temperature at the spinodal contour is shown in fig .",
    "the critical temperature appears to only slightly exceed 8 mev .",
    "such observation is in agreement with experimental results @xcite .",

    "the system expanded according to    @xmath15    which is closely related to @xmath13 . at each step of the procedure",
    "the temperature was incremented by a small value , corresponding increase of the internal ( excitation ) energy was proportional to @xmath13 and the density was modified according to the calculated volume expansion coefficient .",
    "finally , new value of the pressure was calculated from the equation of state using new values of density and temperature . the resulting evolution of the system is shown in fig . [ fg2]a as a nearly horizontal line starting from the ground state .",
    "the pressure of the system appears to grow very slowly while the system expands .",

    "such a short plateau was observed in the experiment @xcite , where it correlated with the onset of thermal equilibrium with the nucleonic gas , as represented by agreement of the extracted double isotope - ratio temperature with the kinematic temperature of protons .",

    "it can be seen that for the asymmetric system with @xmath44 0.3 there occurs a well pronounced isospin asymmetric liquid - gas phase transition with a sizable part of the system being converted into very isospin asymmetric vapor while the rest of the system becomes still more and more symmetric liquid .",

    "the system must pass the multifragmentation barrier and thus these systems will be unstable toward sudden decomposition into multiple fragments . such a scenario can provide explanation for the somewhat confusing situation where signatures of both first and second order phase transitions can be extracted from observed data ( even from the same set of data ) . the first - order behavior can be attributed to the distillation of isospin - asymmetric gas while the second - order signatures can be attributed to subsequent fragmentation ( percolation ) of the remaining symmetric liquid .",
    "it is also interesting that the conclusions observed here are in good agreement with the assumptions used by the statistical model of multifragmentation ( smm ) @xcite where the fragment partition is considered at equilibrium with nucleonic gas .",
    "such a scenario is supported also by experimental data @xcite .",
    "other interesting point is that the @xmath16 density dependence of the symmetry energy used in the present work appears as satisfactorily describing the properties of asymmetric nuclear matter at sub - saturation densities .",

    "one can use known equations of state of initial and final states of the quark - gluonic plasma and the hadronic gas and try to interpolate the equation of state in the spinodal region , as is done in ref .",

    "an enthalpy conservation rule was introduced resulting in significant limitations for the isospin - asymmetric liquid - gas phase transition , which is a sizable effect for very isospin - asymmetric systems but becomes negligible for symmetric systems .",
