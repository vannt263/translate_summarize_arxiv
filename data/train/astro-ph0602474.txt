    "in the last years a great deal of interest arose for understanding the formation of the first structures in the universe at the end of the so  called dark age epoch .",
    "this interest is motivated not only by the possibilities of direct measurements of the physical conditions prevailing in these ( proto)structures and the constraining of cosmological parameters at very high redshifts , but also by the measurement of the primordial abundances of key elements ( e.g. , d and li ) in pregalactic epochs as a direct signature of the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) . from the observational side , the re  emission or absorption of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) photons in resonant lines from h@xmath3 , lih , and hd , among other primordial molecules ,",
    "have been suggested as a viable way to detect cosmic protostructures ( dubrovich 1977,1983 ; maoli , melchiorri & tosti 1994 ; maoli et al.1996 ) .",
    "resonant absorption by neutral h at its 21 cm transition has also been proposed to trace protostructures at early cosmic times ( hogan & rees 1979 ; for more recent studies see barkana & loeb 2005 and more references therein ) .",
    "the first attempt to detect lih emission and doppler  induced anisotropies in the cmbr from the protostructures at redshift @xmath4 was made with the 30 meter iram radio  telescope ( de bernardis et al .",
    "1993 ) . only upper limits for the abundance of lih were obtained .",
    "it was believed that the relative abundance of lih , [ lih / h ] , at @xmath5 could be rather adequate ( up to @xmath6 ) to produce detectable spectral features due to the optical depth in the lines of the lih rotational structure .",
    "however , more detailed calculations of the primordial lih relative abundance have shown that , at the discussed epochs ( @xmath5 ) , it should have been actually very small , [ lih / h ] @xmath7 ( stancil , lepp & dalgarno 1996 ; bougleux & galli 1997 ) .",
    "therefore the optical depth in the rotational lines of lih in the primordial gas is too small to produce observational features ( galli & palla 1998 ; puy & signore 2001 ; maoli et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the other primordial molecule , potentially interesting to detect features of precollapse structures from the dark epoch , is deuterated hydrogen , hd . the dipole moment of the hd molecule is actually much smaller than the one of lih : @xmath8 debyes ( abgrall et al . 1982 ) and @xmath9 debyes .",
    "however , for [ lih / h]@xmath10 and [ hd / h]=@xmath11 , one obtains in a first approximation @xmath12 [ hd]d@xmath13 [ lih ] d@xmath14 , concluding that hd is a species more suitable for detecting the primordial structure signatures than lih .",
    "besides , the hd molecule is also able to amplify its emission due to ro ",
    "vibrational luminescence effects ( see e.g. , dubrovich 1997 ) . at the moment , the most remote of the detected absorbers in rotational lines of hd molecule is at redshift @xmath15 in the spectrum of the quasar @xmath16 ( varshalovich et al .",
    "nevertheless , the emission of this molecule should be observable even from the pregalactic epoch .    in the intermediate epochs at @xmath17 , where nonlinear collapse takes place for the mass scales of interest",
    ", the hd molecule can reemit the kinetic energy of gas out of equilibrium . the emission from primordial molecular clouds in the pure rotational structure of hd molecule owing to cooling processes",
    "has been calculated first time by shchekinov ( 1986 ) and more accurate by kamaya & silk ( 2003 ) .",
    "recently , lipovka , nez  lpez & avila  reese ( 2005 ) have revisited the cooling function of this molecule by taking into account its ro  vibrational structure . at temperatures above @xmath18k and at high densities ,",
    "the cooling function is 12 orders of magnitude higher than reported before e.g. , ( flower et al . 2000 ) .",
    "if photo  ionization or shocks heat the dense collapsing clouds to temperatures above @xmath19k , these new calculations show that the gas will be able to cool efficiently again with further hd resonant line emission , and the intensity of the collapse energy reemission by the hd molecule calculated by kamaya & silk ( 2003 ) will increase probably due to the ro - vibrational structure of this molecule .",
    "recently , it was also suggested that the h@xmath20 and hd fractions can be substantially large in relic hii regions ( johnson & bromm 2006 ; yoshida 2006 ) , as well as in large mass haloes in which the gas is collisionally ionized ( oh & haiman 2003 ) .    at the linear stage of evolution of the first structures of interest ( @xmath21 ) , the elastic resonant scattering of the cmbr by primordial molecules in the evolving protostructures can damp cmbr primary anisotropies or , if the protostructures have peculiar velocities , secondary anisotropies in emission ( spectral  spatial fluctuations ) can be produced ( dubrovich 1977,1993,1997 ) . in these cases ,",
    "internal energy sources are not required to produce the observational spectral and spatial features",
    ". therefore , _ primordial resonant lines are ideal to study the evolution of cosmic structures during their linear phase or the first phases of their collapse , before star formation triggers_. the main goal of the present work is to study the possible observational signatures from these phases previous to the collapse of luminous objects in the universe .",
    "the hd molecule have at least two advantages for this task : 1 ) it is formed rather fast in the homogeneous primordial gas at @xmath22 , through channels similar to those of molecular hydrogen , and it may reach relatively high abundances at those epochs . indeed , at @xmath4 , the relative abundance of hd is already @xmath23 of the presend ",
    "2 ) the redshifted wavelength range of the rotational structure transitions of the hd molecule is very comfortable for detection .",
    "the first , second , and third rotational transitions at the wavelength of 112.1 @xmath24 , 56.2 @xmath24 , and 37.7@xmath24 can be detected at 0.83.5 mm if the lines are produced at redshifts around 2030 , typical of the epochs when the first stars probably started to form according to numerical and semi  analytical results ( for a review see bromm & larson 2004 ) .",
    "several facilities planned or under construction will cover the submillimetric and millimetric wavelength ranges with high sensitivity , for example the large millimetric telescope ( lmt , or gtm for its acronym in spanish ) in mexico , whose radiometers cover the range from 0.8 to 3 mm .",
    "galli & palla ( 2002 ) presented results from detailed calculations of chemical kinetics in thermally evolving primordial clouds , though they did not follow the hydrodynamical evolution .",
    "the relative abundance of the hd molecule that these authors found is very high in the cooled gas clouds and , as it will be shown later here , must be observable , so , more accurate calculations of the protocloud and cloud formation process and emission by the hd molecule are required .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold : to recall the importance of the hd molecule for investigating the very high  redshift universe , and to calculate the parameters of hd lines of interest .",
    "the latter is a crucial step for planning future observational strategies .",
    "we will estimate the optical depth for protoclouds in the rotational lines of the primordial hd molecule based on the @xmath1 cold dark matter ( @xmath1cdm ) scenario of cosmic structure formation . for alternative scenarios ( e.g. , khlopov & rubin 2004 )",
    ", the predictions will probably be different .    with the aim to obtain useful estimates , here",
    "we calculate detailed chemical kinematics evolution for hd molecule in the expanding homogeneous medium (  2 ) .",
    "then we calculate the properties of high ",
    "density @xmath1cdm mass perturbations ( protohaloes ) at their maximum expansion (  3.1 ) , and estimate the optical depths in the three lowest rotational line transitions of the hd molecule fraction in these protohaloes (  3.2 ) .",
    "we bear in mind that these opacities will slightly decrease in the first phases of collapse when the line  widths increase and become potentially observable as secondary spatial  frequency anisotropies in the cmbr .",
    "we estimate the amplitudes and angular sizes of these anisotropies assuming the linear model for the peculiar velocities of the mass perturbations , and explore the possibility to detect them by the lmt / gtm submillimeter telescope under construction in mexico (  3.3 )",
    ". finally , we present a discussion of the implications of our results (  4 ) .",
    "following , we calculate the evolution of the hd abundance in the homogeneous pregalactic medium . this is a good approximation to the hd abundance in mass perturbations at their linear evolution phases as yet .",
    "we use the concordance cosmological model ( @xmath1cdm ) with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 kms@xmath29mpc@xmath29(e.g . , spergel et al . 2003 ) .",
    "standard bbn yields for the light elements are assumed .    in the early epochs , before the first cosmic objects are formed , the thermodynamics of the primordial gas is out of equilibrium .",
    "therefore , in order to describe the molecular dynamics , we need to solve the kinetic equation system , which can be written as follows : @xmath30where @xmath31 is the cosmic time , @xmath32 is the density of the species @xmath33 , @xmath34 are the rates of the collisional processes @xmath35 , as functions of the kinetic temperature @xmath36 , @xmath37 are the rates of the radiative processes ( formation and destruction of the molecule by the cmbr photons characterized by the radiative temperature @xmath38 ) .    in eq .",
    "( [ kinetic ] ) the positive and negative terms correspond to the formation and destruction processes of the species @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "to solve the equations system ( [ kinetic ] ) , it is convenient to introduce new variables : @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the present - day baryon number density , @xmath42 .",
    "it is also convenient to substitute the cosmic time variable with the redshift , by using the appropriate relation for the flat cosmology with cosmological constant adopted here : @xmath43with these new variables , eqs .",
    "( [ kinetic ] ) take the form : @xmath44 .",
    "\\label{17}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as was mentioned above , the reaction rates @xmath45 and @xmath46 are functions of the radiative temperature @xmath38 and the kinetic temperature @xmath36 , which depend on many parameters . the radiative temperature can be taken as in the case of the adiabatic expansion , @xmath47 , but in order to find the kinetic temperature we have to solve the differential equation for @xmath36 : @xmath48 where the first term in the right  hand part describes the change on the temperature due to the universe expansion , the second one corresponds to the thermodynamics of the primordial molecules , and the third one is thomson scattering .",
    "the second term can be written as follows : @xmath49where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the heating and cooling functions , @xmath52 is the energy gain ( loss ) due to the chemical reactions , characterized by their enthalpy @xmath53 , @xmath54the summation is carried out over all chemical reactions .",
    "the factor @xmath55 in the last term of eq .",
    "( secondterm ) corresponds to the change in the primordial gas density due to the chemical reactions , which do not conserve the number of initial species ( for example @xmath56 , or @xmath57 ) .",
    "the calculations of the molecular abundances were carried out for a wide range of redshifts for the following species involved in hd molecule formation : h , h@xmath58 , h@xmath59 , h@xmath3 , h@xmath60 , e@xmath60 , h@xmath61 , he , he@xmath58 , heh@xmath58 , d , hd , h@xmath3d@xmath58 , d@xmath58 , d@xmath60 , and hd@xmath62 .",
    "other species are negligible in the formation processes of the hd molecule due to their small abundances .",
    "the following reactions are of particular importance in the formation / destruction processes of the hd molecule in the primordial gas : @xmath63 more detailed consideration can be found in the many papers ( see for example galli & palla 1998,2002 ) .",
    "the results of our molecular abundance calculations are shown in fig . 1 .",
    "one can see that the relative abundance ratio [ hd]/[h@xmath3 ] at low redshifts is slightly larger than @xmath65 , whereas at high redshifts this value tends to the assumed primordial ratio [ d]/[h]=3  10@xmath66 .",
    "this fact is explained as the deuteration process , d@xmath67h@xmath68 h@xmath67hd and d @xmath69 h@xmath70 hd @xmath69 h , that leads to relatively high abundance of the molecule , up to [ hd]/[h@xmath3]@xmath71 at @xmath72 in collapsed clouds ( see e.g. , galli & palla 2002 ) .",
    "we are now interested in obtaining estimates related to the observability of the line features of the primordial hd molecule in protostructures in their linear or quasi  linear evolution regime , i.e. before gravitational collapse , and first star formation .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , previous works have shown that the largest resonant line opacities in homogeneous mass perturbations are produced when they are at their maximum expansion or turn  around epoch .",
    "based on these conclusions , here we will calculate the hd resonant line opacities at the turnaround epoch of cdm high  peak mass perturbations . after the first bursts of star formation ( population iii stars ) in the high  peak ( @xmath73 ) collapsed perturbations , re  ionization ,",
    "feedback and metal enrichment processes change drastically the properties of the medium in the lower density mass perturbations .",
    "this is why we will focus on the protostructures emerging from high 36@xmath74 peaks .",
    "the interaction of cmbr photons with the primordial molecules inside these protostructures will produce signatures related to the pristine conditions of gas before the first star formation in the universe .",

    "now let us estimate the integration time required for the detection of the secondary anisotropies with millimeter and submillimeter facilities under construction as for example : the 50 m lmt / gtm telescope in sierra negra , mexico ; the `` combined array for research in millimeter  wave astronomy '' ( carma ) in usa ; the `` atacama large millimeter array '' ( alma ) in chile .",

    "let us discuss another important parameter of the potentially observed protoclouds in molecular resonant line emission : their apparent angular size or diameter .",

    "( [ angsize ] ) to calculate the angular size @xmath235 of @xmath236 and @xmath215 protoclouds reaching their maximum expansion in the redshift range of @xmath237 ( corresponding roughly to mass ranges of @xmath238 and @xmath239 for the @xmath213 and @xmath75 cases , respectively ) .",
    "we calculate also the corresponding redshifted frequencies , @xmath240 , for the same three lowest rotational transitions of hd molecule considered in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "our results are shown in fig . 5 , along with the expected coverage in this @xmath241 plane for the lmt / gtm and carma facilities ( boxes ) .",
    "the alma facility covers the whole plotted plane .",
    "we also include in this plot the curves corresponding to the cold clouds within collapsed @xmath236 and @xmath75 haloes for only the first rotational transition line ( thin lines with square dots ) .",
    "these clouds could be resolved by alma and only partially by carma .",
    "it should be noted that high  peak halos are strongly clustered ( gao et al .",
    "2005 ; reed et al .",
    ". it may thus be more plausible to find a cluster of such objects in a patch of the sky even if individual objects are very small .",
    "moreover , the clustering increases the amplitude of the spectra  spatial fluctuations in the cmbr temperature .",
    "figure 5 is rather general and can be applied to any other resonant lines of similar frequencies in which the gas in protohaloes or haloes could be detected .",
    "the hope to detect signals from the end of the so  called dark age has prompted a flurry of theoretical and instrumental activity .",
    "the observation of high  redshift protostructures before they collapse and star formation triggers will certainly help us to constrain structure formation scenarios .",
    "one possibility of such observations is based on the spectral  spatial fluctuations in the cmbr temperature produced by elastic resonant scattering of cmbr photons on molecules located in protostructures moving with peculiar velocity .",
    "this kind of secondary anisotropies search for lih molecule has been fruitless ( de bernardis et al . 1993 ) . as bougleux & galli ( 1997 ) showed , the abundances of lih molecule and their optical depths in the rotational lines are too small to produce detectable cmbr temperature fluctuations .    in this paper",
    "we have investigated the spectral  spatial fluctuations in the the cmbr temperature due to elastic resonant scattering by hd molecules . for this molecule ,",
    "the main contribution to the optical depth comes from the ground rotational transition ( @xmath189)=(10 ) , because of small populations with high rotational levels of the hd molecule at early epochs . in the case of the lih molecule ,",
    "most of the contribution to the optical depth comes from rotational transitions between high @xmath163 levels .",
    "the wavelenght at rest of the hd ( @xmath189)=(10 ) transition is 112.1 @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath212 it should be observed at the wavelengths @xmath242 mm . for higher rotational transitions ,",
    "the wavelengths are smaller .",
    "we have carried out calculations in order to estimate the hd optical depths and the corresponding amplitudes of the spectral  spatial fluctuations in the cmbr temperature produced by moving protostructures .",
    "first we calculated detailed chemical kinematic evolution for hd molecule in the expanding and adiabatically cooling homogeneous medium , assuming standard bbn yields .",
    "we further calculated the optical depths in hd pure rotational lines for mass perturbations ( protostructures ) at their maximum expansion under the assumption that the hd relative fractions , @xmath179 , within these protostructures are similar to the fractions calculated for the homogeneous medium at a given @xmath121 .",
    "the spherical top  hat approach and the concordance @xmath1cdm cosmology were used to calculate the corresponding turn  around redshifts , sizes , and peculiar velocities for different masses and peaks .",
    "once the optical depths for the first three ground rotational transitions were calculated , the corresponding fluctuations @xmath243 were estimated .",
    "we also estimated @xmath244 and @xmath243 for cold gas clouds inside collapsed cdm haloes , but under several assumptions and using results on the hd relative fraction from a crude calculation by galli & palla ( 2002 ) .",
    "the main results from our study are the following :    @xmath245 the relative fraction of hd molecule , @xmath246 , increases in the homogeneous expanding medium by a factor of @xmath247 since @xmath248 to low redshifts ( fig .",
    "1 ) . at redshifts",
    "@xmath249 , @xmath250 .",
    "these fractions are expected to strongly increase during the cooling and collapse of the gas within cdm haloes .",
    "@xmath245 the optical depth of the hd first pure rotational line in high  peak protostructures at their maximum expansion increases with time . for the second and third lines ,",
    "the corresponding @xmath180 s attain a maximum at high redshifts and then strongly decrease for lower redshifts .",
    "the ranges of @xmath180 values of the ( 10 ) transition lines in 3 and @xmath75 protostructures at their maximum expansion in the @xmath237 redshift interval are approximately @xmath251 and @xmath252 , respectively ( figs . 2 and 3 ) . for the crude model of cold gas clouds inside collapsed 3 and @xmath75 cdm haloes , the ranges of @xmath180 in the same redshift interval are @xmath253 and @xmath254 , respectively ( fig .",
    "the optical depths of hd rotational lines in protostructures are much higher than those of the lih molecule .",
    "@xmath245 the ranges of redshifted frequencies and typical angular sizes in the sky of spectral  spatial fluctuations due to hd molecule rotational lines in high  peak protostructures and gas clouds in collapsed haloes fall partially within the observational windows of submillimeter telescope facilities under construction , as gtm / lmt , carma and alma ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "the range of redshifts under consideration was @xmath237 ; after this epoch the first baryonic structures are probably already in site with strong emitting stellar sources .",
    "the observational search of the spectral  spatial fluctuations studied here will be important for testing models of cosmic structure formation as well as the primordial abundance of deuterium predicted in standard and non - standard bbn theories .",
    "@xmath245 for the @xmath1cdm scenario , the amplitudes of the spectral  spatial fluctuations produced by hd molecule at @xmath237 in protostructures , even as rare as @xmath255 density  peaks , are too faint for reaching the flux sensitivity of submillimeter / millimeter facilities under construction . for the case of cold gas clouds within collapsed @xmath1cdm haloes emerging from @xmath256 density  peaks , the estimated amplitudes , in particular for the lowest rotational transition line , are much larger and could be detected , but their estimated angular sizes in the sky are too small for telescopes such as gtm / lmt , but possibly clusters of such objects could be resolved ( high  peak halos are strongly clustered ) .",
    "the spectral  spatial fluctuations predicted for very rare high  redshift cold clouds in the @xmath1cdm scenario will fall within the observational capabilities of other facilities as carma and alma . for non - standard bbn theories , the [ d / h ]",
    "abundance can be much larger than the used here .",
    "for example , in inhomegeneous bbn models , [ d / h ] is estimated to be ten times larger than in the standard bbn ( e.g. , lara 2005 ) .",
    "therefore the hd line optical depths presented here could be a factor of ten higher , making already detectable the corresponding spectral ",
    "spatial fluctuations produced at the maximum expansion of protohaloes .    a more detailed study of spectral  spatial fluctuations due to hd molecules in collapsing gas clouds as well as the inclusion of alternative bbn models is necessary in order to get more precise results and predictions than the ones presented here . in this paper",
    "we have carried out preliminary calculations that show the viability of using hd molecule lines to search for signatures of early structure formation in the universe and/or to constrain cosmological theories .",
