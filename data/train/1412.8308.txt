    "presently , the investigation of magnetized quark matter is attracting the attention of the physics community due to its relevance for different regions of the qcd phase diagram : from the heavy ion collisions at very high energies , to the understanding of the early stages of the universe and for studies involving compact objects like magnetars . in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath0 ,",
    "the competition between two different mechanisms determine the behavior of quark matter : on one hand , the increase of low energy contributions leads to an enhancement of the quark condensate ; on the other hand , the suppression of the quark condensate due to the partial restoration of chiral symmetry .    at zero baryonic chemical potential , almost all low - energy effective models , including the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl)-type models , find an enhancement of the condensate due to the magnetic field , the so - called magnetic catalysis ( mc ) , and no reduction of the pseudocritical chiral transition temperature with the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , the suppression of the quark condensate , also known as inverse magnetic catalysis ( imc ) , was obtained in lattice qcd ( lqcd ) calculations with physical quark masses @xcite . due to the imc effect the pseudocritical chiral transition temperature decreases and the polyakov loop increases with increasing @xmath0 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is argued that the imc may be a consequence of how the gluonic sector reacts to the presence of a magnetic field , and , it is shown that the magnetic field drives up the expectation value of the polyakov field .",
    "the distribution of gluon fields changes as a consequence of the distortion of the quark loops in the magnetic field background .",
    "therefore , the backreactions of the quarks on the gauge fields should be incorporated in effective models in order to describe the imc .",
    "it is also known that in the region of low momenta , relevant for chiral symmetry breaking , there is a strong screening effect of the gluon interactions which suppresses the condensate @xcite . in this region ,",
    "the gluons acquire a mass @xmath1 of the order of @xmath2 , due to the coupling of the gluon field to a quark - antiquark interacting state . in the presence of a strong enough magnetic field ,",
    "this mass @xmath1 for gluons becomes larger .",
    "this , along with the property that the strong coupling @xmath3 decreases with increasing @xmath0 ( @xmath4^{-1}$ ] with @xmath5 @xcite ) , leads to an effective weakening of the interaction between the quarks in the presence of an external magnetic field , and damps the chiral condensate .",
    "this suggests that the effective interaction between the quarks should include the reaction of the gluon distribution to the magnetic field background . having this in mind ,",
    "the present work shows two different approaches of taking into account the influence of the presence of an external magnetic field in the gluonic sector .",
    "we perform our calculations in the framework of the polyakov  nambu  jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model .",
    "the lagrangian in the presence of an external magnetic field is given by @xmath6 q ~+~       g_s \\sum_{a=0}^8 \\left [ ( { \\bar q } \\lambda _ a q)^2 + ( { \\bar q } i\\gamma_5 \\lambda_a q)^2 \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\      -k\\left\\{{\\rm det } \\left [ { \\bar q}(1+\\gamma_5 ) q \\right ] +       { \\rm det}\\left [ { \\bar q}(1-\\gamma_5)q\\right]\\right\\ } +       \\mathcal{u}\\left(\\phi,\\bar\\phi;t\\right ) - \\frac{1}{4}f_{\\mu \\nu}f^{\\mu \\nu } ,      \\label{pnjl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the quarks couple to a ( spatially constant ) temporal background gauge field , represented in terms of the polyakov loop . besides the chiral point - like coupling @xmath7 , that denotes the coupling of the scalar - type four - quark interaction in the njl sector , in the pnjl model the gluon dynamics is reduced to the chiral - point coupling between quarks together with a simple static background field representing the polyakov loop .",
    "the polyakov potential @xmath8 is introduced and depends on the critical temperature @xmath9 , that for pure gauge is 270 mev .",
    "in addition to the pnjl model , we also consider the effective vertex depending on the polyakov loop @xcite ( epnjl model ) , @xmath10 $ ] , that generates an entanglement interaction between the polyakov loop and the chiral condensate .    in _ case",
    "i _ we adopt a running coupling of the chiral invariant quartic quark interaction in the pnjl model with the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the damping of the strength of the effective interaction is build phenomenologically : since there is no available lqcd data for @xmath11 , we fit @xmath12 in order to reproduce the chiral pseudocritical temperature @xmath13 obtained in lqcd calculations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 coupling , that reproduces @xmath13 , is calculated in the njl model and is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_tc ] ( solid black line ) .",
    "now , using this @xmath12 coupling in the pnjl model , both the deconfinement transition and chiral transition pseudocritical temperatures are decreasing functions with @xmath14 , up to @xmath15 gev@xmath16 . due to the existing coupling between the polyakov loop field and quarks , the @xmath12 does not only affect the chiral transition but also the deconfinement transition .",
    "the scalar coupling @xmath7 versus the magnetic field ; right panel @xmath17 the chiral and deconfinement temperatures as a function of @xmath14 , being the full ( dashed ) lines for _ case i _",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    in _ case ii _ we introduce an @xmath18dependence on the pure - gauge critical temperature @xmath9 , reproducing the lqcd data for the deconfinement transition @xcite , in order to mimic the reaction of the gluon sector to the presence of an external magnetic field",
    ".    we will use the epnjl model because within the pnjl it is not possible to implement the above scheme , since the chiral transition temperatures increase strongly with the external magnetic field . in order to bring these temperatures down",
    ", it would be necessary to use very small values of @xmath9 , for which the deconfinement phase transition becomes of first order .    nevertheless , within epnjl the chiral condensates and the polyakov loop",
    "are entangled .",
    "thus , the chiral transition temperatures are pulled down to temperatures close to the deconfinement transition temperature .",
    "this model , however , at moderate magnetic fields , still predicts a first order transition for both transitions , when a small @xmath9 is needed . as a consequence",
    ", a too small value of @xmath9 leads to a first order phase transition within both pnjl and epnjl models , and , therefore , the range of @xmath9 values we are interested in is limited to the values that maintain the crossover transition . a larger range of validity is obtained if the quark backreactions are not taken into account at @xmath19 , i.e. when @xmath20 mev as obtained in pure gauge .",
    "this gives @xmath21 mev , 40 mev higher than the prediction of lattice qcd data in @xcite .",
    "this parametrization reproduces the referred lattice qcd data for @xmath22 , shifted by 40 mev , for magnetic fields up to @xmath23 . above 0.61 gev@xmath16",
    ", a first order phase transition occurs .",
    "we will use the last scenario in _ case ii _ to illustrate our results because larger magnetic fields are achieved .",
    "moreover , in the epnjl the coupling @xmath7 depends on the polyakov loop , thus , in the crossover region , where the polyakov loop increases with temperature , the coupling @xmath7 becomes weaker .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_tc ] ( left panel ) , where the coupling @xmath24 $ ] is plotted for several temperatures ( dashed curves ) @xcite . within the pnjl model with constant coupling @xmath7",
    ", no imc effect was obtained even with @xmath25 , because @xmath25 does not affect the coupling @xmath7 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_tc ] ( right panel ) , the results for the pseudocritical temperatures for both cases are compared .",
    "in _ case ii _ , the pseudocritical temperatures have a much flatter behavior at small values of @xmath14 than in _ case i _ , reflecting the softer decrease of the coupling @xmath7 at small magnetic field values as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit_tc ] ( left panel ) . also , within the epnjl with @xmath25 , the difference between the pseudocritical temperatures @xmath26 and @xmath27 is much smaller , due to the strong coupling between the polyakov loop and the quark condensates . for @xmath28",
    "these temperatures are almost coincident , but a finite strong magnetic field destroys this coincidence . the pnjl model with @xmath12",
    "does not have this feature and different temperatures for @xmath26 and @xmath27 are predicted .",
    "according to @xcite , we define the change of the light quark condensate due to the magnetic field as @xmath29 with @xmath30 + 1 , $ ] where the factor @xmath31 in the denominator contains the pion mass in the vacuum ( @xmath32 mev ) and ( the chiral limit of the ) pion decay constant ( @xmath33 mev ) in njl model .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : condensate ] the light chiral condensate @xmath34 is plotted as a function of the magnetic field , for @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) gev@xmath16 in _ case i ( case ii ) _ , at temperatures close to the respective @xmath37 .",
    "the main conclusions are : * i ) * for both cases the qualitative behavior shown in fig . 2 of ref . @xcite and in fig",
    ". 6 of ref .",
    "@xcite is reproduced , that is , the non - monotonic behavior of the condensates as a function of the magnetic field , having the @xmath38 curves the highest @xmath34 ; * ii ) * for temperatures close @xmath39 the strong interplay between the partial restoration of chiral symmetry and the condensate enhancement due to the magnetic field gives rise to curves that increase , for small values of @xmath14 , and as soon as the partial restoration of chiral symmetry becomes dominant the curve starts to decrease .",
    "finally , the effect of the magnetic field on the polyakov loop is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : polyakov ] , where the polyakov loop value , @xmath40 , is plotted as a function of the temperature , for several magnetic field strengths .",
    "as can be seen , for both cases , the polyakov loop increases sharply with the magnetic field around the transition temperature , and the transition temperature decreases with the magnetic field with @xmath0 , in close agreement with the lqcd results @xcite . indeed , the suppression of the condensates achieved by the magnetic field dependence of the coupling parameter results in an increase of the polyakov loop , with this effect being stronger precisely for temperatures close to the transition temperature .",
