    "kinetically - constrained models are widely used in the study of jamming- and glass - transitions in amorphous materials  @xcite .",
    "these lattice - gas ( or spin-@xmath2 ising ) models are characterized by having some local restricting set of rules for particle movement ( or spin flip ) . in spin - facilitated models ,",
    "the two possible states at each site represent active versus inactive regions , with the fraction of active sites increasing with increasing temperature .",
    "the density of these active sites corresponds to the density of vacancies in lattice - gas models . in the fredrickson - andresen  @xcite and kob - andersen  @xcite models for example",
    ", the number of neighboring vacant ( active ) sites sets whether a site is _ blocked _ or not , and _ jamming _ of the system is often studied in terms of the fraction of _ frozen _ particles that will permanently remain blocked under the model s dynamics . in the thermodynamic limit these models jam only in the pathological limit of zero temperature or alternatively vanishing vacancy density  @xcite , thus only spatial confinement may induce jamming at a nontrivial density in them  @xcite .    ) is unblocked if its ( ( w _ or",
    "_ e ) _ and _ ( s _ or _",
    "n ) ) sets are completely empty .",
    "( b ) in our 3d model the ( @xmath3 ) site is unblocked if the sets ( ( w _ or _",
    "e ) _ and _ ( s _ or _",
    "n ) _ and _ ( b _ or _",
    "t ) ) are completely empty . ]    in a new class of kinetically - constrained models , referred to as _ jamming - percolation models _",
    "@xcite , the kinetic rules depend not only on the number of neighboring active ( or vacant ) sites but also on their relative orientations .",
    "these models are constructed such that already at some nontrivial density of inactive ( or occupied ) sites @xmath4 , there are percolating clusters of permanently - frozen particles , and the system becomes jammed in the sense that in the thermodynamic limit there is a finite fraction of permanently frozen particles that will never move ( or flip ) .",
    "we focus on a three - dimensional ( 3d ) extension  @xcite of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) spiral model  @xcite .",
    "the spiral model is defined on a square lattice by having a set of kinetic constraints so that if ( _ n _ or _ s _ ) and ( _ w _ or _ e _ ) sets are completely empty the central site is unblocked , see fig .  [ fig : spiral_rules ] . the 3d model is defined on a cubic lattice so that if ( _ n _ or _ s _ ) and ( _ w _ or _ e _ ) and ( _ t _ or _ b _ ) sets are completely empty the central site is unblocked  @xcite .    in the spin versions of the models , unblocked spins may stochastically flip between their active and inactive states at some temperature - dependent rates . in the lattice - gas versions , an unblocked particle may hop to a neighboring vacant site only if that particle is unblocked by the model rules also after moving to that target site .",
    "these kinetic rules are constructed so that the dynamics will obey time - reversal symmetry , and as a consequence a particle can change with time from being blocked to being unblocked , however it can not change with time between being frozen and unfrozen . thus the initial condition sets which particles are frozen and which are unfrozen , or _",
    "mobile_. the behavior in the spin - facilitated and in the lattice - gas versions of these models is almost identical , and we will focus on the lattice - gas models , for which particles move on the lattice . here",
    "we can study whether the mobile particles exhibit long - time diffusive behavior or whether they are _ caged _ by the frozen particles .",
    "the 2d and the 3d models undergo a mixed - order phase transition at some ( different ) jamming density @xmath0 , at which the fraction of frozen particles jumps discontinuously from zero to some finite value  @xcite , as in a first - order transition , while the minimal number of moves required to unblock a site diverges  @xcite , reflecting diverging length and time scales  @xcite as in a second - order transition .",
    "interestingly , in these lattice - gas models the motion of the unfrozen particles exhibits a qualitative difference between two and three dimensions ; since the kinetic rules in jamming - percolation models map to a _ directed - percolation _ problem , the percolating clusters of _ frozen sites _ have a string - like , or quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) structure . in two dimensions ,",
    "once frozen particles appear , their 1d strings _ cage _ the unfrozen particles into compact regions and thus the self diffusion vanishes at @xmath0 and jamming and caging are tantamount , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster_map_2d ] . the frozen clusters are 1d also in three dimensions , however here the unfrozen regions may be topologically connected and can allow unfrozen particles to use the third dimension in order to diffuse with time , and indeed dynamical simulations demonstrated long - time diffusive behavior also in some range of @xmath5  @xcite .     for a square lattice of linear size @xmath6 .",
    "frozen particles are marked in dark red , and unfrozen sites in bright green . at the critical jamming density @xmath7 ,",
    "frozen particles appear and immediately span the system and cage the unfrozen particles . ]    in this paper we show that in 3d jamming percolation the self - diffusion coefficient vanishes at some second , higher critical density @xmath8 , and that this second phase transition is a continuous percolation transition .",
    "we first identify not only the frozen particles but also the frozen vacant sites , namely sites that are empty and no particle will ever be able to enter them .",
    "together , the frozen particles and the frozen vacant sites constitute the entirety of frozen sites in the system .",
    "secondly , we infer on the existence of long - time diffusive motion of the unfrozen particles based on whether the unfrozen sites percolate across the system .",
    "we find that in two dimensions caging coincides with the jamming transition , while in three dimensions caging occurs only at a second critical density @xmath9 .",
    "namely , _ there is a range of densities @xmath10 in which the system is jammed yet uncaged_.",
    "we begin with a _ culling _ procedure to identify the frozen particles . in this process a random initial configuration on the lattice is considered , we then test according to the kinetic constraints of the model s dynamics whether each particle is blocked or not , and subsequently remove the unblocked particles .",
    "the resulting configuration is then analyzed again in the same manner to identify the blocked particles , and the process continues iteratively until no more particles may be removed .",
    "we identify the remaining particles as the frozen particles that will never be able to move . for spin - facilitated models ,",
    "such culling generates one specific possible trajectory of the dynamics and thus exactly identifies the permanently - frozen inactive spins . for lattice - gas models on the other hand ,",
    "culling formally gives only a lower bound on the frozen particles , and in principle particles that were culled may in fact be frozen , see fig .",
    "[ fig : culling_wrong ] .",
    "however , in the thermodynamic limit we expect such effects to be negligible . moreover , we speculate that the culling algorithm might misidentify frozen particles as unfrozen only if they are caged . this misidentification occurs when a particle is mobile but localized , in the manner that no matter where it goes it still blocks one other particle , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : culling_wrong ] .",
    "if the mobile particle is not caged , then it can move far from its initial position , and thus it no longer blocks the other particle .",
    "since we are interested in the motion of particles in the uncaged case , this discrepancy should not affect our results .",
    "culling is very useful as it allows one to infer on the very long - time behavior of a slowly - relaxing system without running a dynamical simulation , and by only analyzing the structure of its initial configuration  @xcite .",
    "similarly , _ we would like to predict the long - time diffusive behavior of mobile , or unfrozen particles in our system based solely on the structure of the initial configuration_. this would be very valuable since measuring the self - diffusion of particles is time consuming and indecisive .",
    "the first step toward this goal is identifying the vacant frozen sites , namely sites that will never be occupied by a particle .",
    "these are vacant sites that will never be able to change their occupation and become occupied because of the presence of frozen particles in their proximity .",
    "therefore , we consider the frozen particles as identified by the culling algorithm and check for all the initially - vacant sites whether the frozen particles block them or not , see fig .",
    "[ fig : culling_explain ] .",
    "the resulting unfrozen vacant sites together with the initial locations of the unfrozen particles constitute the unfrozen sites in the system , in which the mobile particles can move .        , which is between the jamming density @xmath11 and the caging density @xmath12 , and b ) @xmath13 , which is above @xmath9 , for a cubic lattice of linear size @xmath6 .",
