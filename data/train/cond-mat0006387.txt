    "the shape of the surface of a liquid or soap film constrained at its boundaries is a classic subject of mathematical physics  @xcite .",
    "these studies demonstrate the power of producing very smooth surfaces of controlled curvature by choosing the shape of the boundary . the chief emphasis of these prior studies is to determine the global shape of the surface bounded by a given smooth surface . here",
    "we emphasize the complementary question of the local surface shape in response to a singular boundary shape : namely , a line with a sharp bend enclosing a droplet spanning a plane sector of angle @xmath0 .",
    "the role of singularities in governing the shape and the motion of fluids has aroused great current interest .",
    "such singularities occur when a fluid droplet breaks apart  @xcite , when it merges another droplet  @xcite , when it moves across a surface  @xcite , or when it moves through another fluid  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , a qualitative change in the surface shape occurs as the opening angle of the boundary @xmath0 increases past a right angle , as we show below .",
    "the curvatures for acute angles remain finite for the region near the vertex .",
    "but for obtuse angles , the curvatures diverge as the vertex is approached , with a power law that varies continuously with the angle .",
    "similar characteristic angles ( not necessarily equal to 90 degrees ) are encountered in the problem of capillary rise in a vertical wedge - shaped container . here",
    "the meniscus height is bounded if the opening angle of the wedge is larger than some critical value and diverges as @xmath1 if the opening angle is less than that critical value  @xcite .",
    "the contrasting behavior of acute and obtuse angles has also been noted for other phenomena involving laplacian fields . in hydrodynamic flow ,",
    "the velocity field near a wedge changes qualitatively as the angle increases through a right angle  @xcite . in diffusion ( and analogous random - walk polymers ) emanating into a wedge - shaped region there is a similar qualitative change of behavior  @xcite .",
    "our motivation for focusing on droplets over an angular sector arises from observations of irregular droplets seen in everyday life .",
    "these often have sector - shaped regions arising from the vagaries of deposition and substrate shape .",
    "we have noticed that evaporation in these regions leads to distinctive drying patterns of solids dissolved in the liquid . to understand the nature of these drying patterns requires knowledge of the surface shape .",
    "for the circular drops the problem of the surface shape assumes very simple solution ( spherical cap ) , allowing one to proceed with the issue of evaporation profiles up to the level of successful comparison of the theoretical results with the experimental data .",
    "these so - called `` coffee - drop deposits '' have aroused recent interest  @xcite .",
    "specifically , we consider a droplet on the horizontal surface bounded by an angle @xmath0 in the plane of the substrate ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we assume that the droplet is sufficiently small so that the surface tension is dominant , and the gravitational effects can be safely neglected ( significance of gravity increases with the size of the drop ) . at the same time , we do _ not _ assume that the contact angle between the `` liquid  gas '' surface and the plane is constant along the boundary line on the substrate . to achieve an angular boundary ,",
    "the substrate must have scratches , grooves or other inhomogeneities ( sufficiently small comparing to the dimensions of the droplet ) , which _ pin _ the contact line .",
    "a strongly pinned contact line can sustain a wide range of contact angles ; the angle is not fixed by the interfacial tensions as it is on a uniform surface ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .    ) .",

    "we calculate the curvatures of the obtained surface shape and describe some possible implications . in particular we discuss how the refraction of the light in the drop shows contrasting properties in acute versus obtuse angular regions .",
    "[ [ boundary - problem . ] ] boundary problem .",
    "our purpose is to calculate the shape of the surface of the drop @xmath4 .",
    "use of the cylindrical coordinates looks most natural in this problem so that the angle occupied by the liquid on the substrate is @xmath5 and @xmath6 and hence the boundary conditions are @xmath7 we start from the laplace equation for the surface tension : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mean curvature of the surface @xmath10 and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the two principal curvatures . here",
    "@xmath13 is the surface tension and @xmath14 is the pressure difference between liquid and gas ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "since we neglect the effects of gravity , the pressure within the droplet is constant , and so is @xmath14 .",
    "thus @xmath16 is just a constant parameter of the dimensions of inverse length . since this is the only dimensional scale in the problem , introduction of the dimensionless variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 ) makes the mathematical formulation parameterless : @xmath20",
    "thereby we agree to measure all quantities of the dimension of length in units of @xmath3 .",
    "having found @xmath21 , one can restore the desired surface shape in ordinary units by simple substitution @xmath22 .    given a surface @xmath4 , its mean",

    "the proper choice of this parameter is @xmath41 in ordinary units or @xmath42 in dimensionless ones , which arises from the expression for the total energy @xmath43 .",
    "the euler - lagrange equation for the functional @xmath44 reads exactly as eq .",
    "( [ exact ] ) .",
    "thus , the boundary problem for @xmath4 consists of the equation  ( [ exact ] ) and boundary conditions  ( [ boundary ] ) .",
    "note that we do not specify the boundary conditions at the opposite side of the drop ( the furthest from the vertex ) , and this will lead to a set of undetermined coefficients in the solution to our problem . however , our purpose is to infer the _",
    "universal _ features of the solution near the vertex , determined solely by the opening angle of the sector of interest and independent of the shape of the boundary outside of that sector .",
    "as we show below , knowledge of this subset of boundary conditions imposes sufficiently strict limitations on possible solutions , so that many important properties of the surface shape can be determined on the basis of only these local conditions .",
    "had we specified all the boundary conditions , we would have obtained the exact parameter - free solution , dependent on the global shape of the boundary .",

    "there is no generic method for solving second - order non - linear differential equations of the kind of eq .",

    "boundary conditions can be verified by direct substitution @xmath61 .",
    "the general solution to the homogeneous problem  ( [ zgh ] ) must satisfy the symmetry of the problem ( i.e.  must be even in @xmath62 ) and can be found by standard methods of mathematical physics : @xmath63 = \\re\\left(\\sum\\limits_{n=0}^\\infty c_n \\xi^{(2n+1)\\pi/\\alpha}\\right)\\ ] ] the constants @xmath64 can not be determined without imposing further conditions on the solution ( for instance , obviously @xmath64 may depend on @xmath0 ) .",

    "similar behavior should hold for the light reflected off the surface of the droplet because curvature is equally important for both such phenomena .",
    "another possible system to test the predictions of our study is a pressurized soap film .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig9 ] , a soap film on a wedge - shaped frame with an applied constant pressure difference across it will have constant mean curvature .",
    "thus , it is described by our formalism .",
    "the only difference between such a film and a liquid drop is that the film has two surfaces , and therefore the applied @xmath14 must be two times as much as @xmath14 in equation  ( [ laplace ] ) .",
    "once such a surface is produced , it can be made as big as necessary for experimental convenience , since gravitational effects are virtually absent for this realization .",
    "as these examples illustrate , the change in behavior on going from acute to obtuse planar angular regions can show up in concrete ways .",
    "we suspect that further differences will emerge as capillary flow and evaporation properties of these sector - shaped liquid interfaces are explored .",
    "the authors are grateful to leo kadanoff for an insightful discussion , to joseph keller for a useful mathematical clarification , to sidney redner for pointing out the analogous phenomena in hydrodynamics and diffusion , and to itai cohen for his help with photographing the drops .",
    "this work was supported in part by the mrsec program of the national science foundation under award number dmr-9808595 .",
    "here we present some details on how we obtain expressions  ( [ solution0 ] ) and ( [ solution1])-([solution4 ] ) .",
    "one starts from the substitution of @xmath166 ( the first term of the expansion  ( [ series ] ) ) into eq .",
    "( [ exact ] ) and obtains the following equation for @xmath167 : @xmath168+r^{2\\nu-2}q[\\phi_\\nu]\\right)+r^2\\left(1+r^{2\\nu-2}r[\\phi_\\nu]\\right)^{3/2}=0 \\label{zeroth}\\ ] ] where @xmath169=\\phi_\\nu^{\\prime\\prime}+\\nu^2\\phi_\\nu\\ ] ] @xmath170=\\nu^2\\phi_\\nu^2\\phi_\\nu^{\\prime\\prime}+\\left(\\nu-\\nu^2\\right ) \\phi_\\nu\\left(\\phi'_\\nu \\right)^2+\\nu^3\\phi_\\nu^3\\ ] ] @xmath171=\\left(\\phi'_\\nu\\right)^2+\\nu^2\\phi_\\nu^2\\ ] ] considering all possible values of @xmath98 , leaving only main terms in @xmath2 ( the smallest powers of @xmath2 ) and solving for @xmath172 in each case , one arrives at the following set of solutions ( only even terms are shown due to the symmetry of the problem ) : @xmath173 ( @xmath77 is independent of @xmath2 and @xmath62 everywhere but arbitrary otherwise . ) obviously , the first two options can not satisfy boundary conditions @xmath174 for angles @xmath175 , and thus the `` not horizontal '' solutions with @xmath176 are naturally eliminated . in cases 3 and 4",
    "boundary conditions yield @xmath108 and @xmath177 respectively .",
    "thus , the main order result in the limit @xmath178 is nothing but eq .",
    "( [ solution0 ] ) : @xmath179    then we proceed in exactly the same fashion to determine @xmath99 and to find @xmath180 by employing just calculated main order result .",
    "substitution of the first two terms of the expansion  ( [ series ] ) into equation  ( [ exact ] ) yields the following equation for @xmath180 : @xmath168+r^{\\mu-\\nu}u[\\phi_\\mu]+r^{2\\nu-2}q[\\phi_\\nu]+r^{\\nu+\\mu-2}v[\\phi_\\nu,\\phi_\\mu]+o(r^{2\\mu-2})\\right)\\,+\\ ] ] @xmath181+r^{\\nu+\\mu-2}w[\\phi_\\nu,\\phi_\\mu ] + o(r^{2\\mu-2})\\right)^{3/2}=0 \\label{first}\\ ] ] where @xmath172 is already known , @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath3 are the same as in the equation for @xmath172 , @xmath184= \\phi_\\mu^{\\prime\\prime}+\\mu^2\\phi_\\mu\\ ] ] and expressions for @xmath185 and @xmath186 are irrelevant to any final results . similar to the previous case analysis ,",
    "including thorough consideration of all possible cases for values of @xmath99 , neglect of the terms of the order higher than the first correction in @xmath2 and application of symmetry arguments and boundary conditions to the solutions , leads to the first - order result  ( [ solution1])-([solution4 ] ) ."
