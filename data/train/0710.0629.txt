    "low mass x - ray binaries often display twin kilo - hertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in their x - ray emissions ( van der klis 2006 ; zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) . a wide variety of different models have been proposed to explain the origin and correlations of the different qpos .",
    "these include the beat frequency model ( miller , lamb , & psaltis 1998 ; lamb & miller 2001 ; lamb & miller 2003 ) , the relativistic precession model ( stella & vietri 1999 ) , the alfvn wave model ( zhang 2004 ) , and warped disk models ( shirakawa & lai 2002 ; kato 2004 ) .",
    "a puzzling aspect of the some of the twin qpo sources considered in this work is that the difference between the upper @xmath2 and lower @xmath6 qpo frequencies is roughly either the spin frequency of the star @xmath5 ( @xmath7 cases where @xmath8 hz ) or one - half this frequency , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 cases where @xmath11 hz ) , for the cases where @xmath5 is known , even though @xmath2 and @xmath6 vary significantly ( see , e.g. , zhang et al . 2006 ) .",

    "section 2.1 discusses the corotation instability ,  2.2 the exccentric ( @xmath0 ) mode of the disk driven by the star s rotating magnetic field , and  2.3 the coupled exccentric plus axisymmetric mode ( @xmath14 ) also due to the star s rotating magnetic field .",
    "section 4 gives the conclusions .",
    "we assume a pseudo - newtonian gravitational potential @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the star s mass and @xmath17 . in the absence of the star the angular velocity of disk matter is @xmath18\\}^{1/2}$ ] for @xmath19 . near the star the disk s angular rotation rate in the equatorial plane",

    "figure 1 shows the equilibrium quantities for an illustrative case .",
    "clearly , @xmath27 has a maximum value outside of the star at a distance denoted @xmath28 .",

    "one component of a general perturbation is described by the radial displacement of the disk matter , @xmath94 ( e.g. , zhang & lovelace 2005 ) the equation for @xmath95 is simply @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 is the radial force due to the star s magnetic field .",
    "the radial oscillation frequency ( squared ) on the right - hand side of the equation consists @xmath99 as given earlier plus a thermal contribution @xmath100 where @xmath48 is the radial wavenumber of the perturbation in the wkb approximation .",
    "we consider the case where the star has a small size or point - like dipole located close to the star s surface near the rotation axis with its magnetic moment parallel to the star s surface .",
    "ruderman ( 2006 ) gives physical arguments for this type of configuration of spun - up neutron stars . at a given radial distance in the equatorial plane ,",
    "the total magnetic field @xmath101 consists of the vacuum component @xmath102 , with @xmath103 the star s angular rotation rate , and the induced component , @xmath104 .",
    "the component @xmath105 acts to drive a current flow in the disk @xmath106 which in turn gives rise to the induced magnetic field of the disk @xmath104 .",
    "the radial force includes a coherent component @xmath107 which can be written as @xmath108 where @xmath109 with the average is over @xmath110 . considering only the coherent component , equation ( 4 )",
    "is then a driven oscillator . with @xmath111 and @xmath112 ,",
    "it becomes @xmath113 with @xmath114/c_s^2 $ ] .",
    "depending mainly on the value of @xmath103 , there may be lindblad resonances with inner and outer lindblad radii @xmath115 where @xmath116 .",
    "the region between the two radii is permitted in the sense that @xmath117 while the regions @xmath118 and @xmath119 are forbidden .",
    "the existence of the lindblad resonances means that a weak magnetic disturbance can give rise to a strong disk response in the vicinity of @xmath120 proportional to @xmath121 ( goldreich & tremaine 1979 ) .",
    "because of the rapid decrease of the magnetic field the response at the inner lindblad resonance is expected to be stronger than that at the outer resonance . however , the solution of equation ( 5 ) is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we find that there are lindblad resonances only for for @xmath122  hz for the same conditions as figure 2 . for higher @xmath5 , all values of @xmath62",
    "are forbidden . for @xmath123  hz , @xmath124 , which is within the region of the mentioned corotation instability , and @xmath125 which is outside the region of corotation instability .",
    "the disk velocity @xmath126 is supersonic relative to the velocity of the perturbation @xmath127 for @xmath62 larger than @xmath128 .",
    "consequently the perturbation is a leading spiral wave with @xmath129 . at the outer lindblad radius",
    "the disk velocity is also supersonic relative to @xmath127 , and excitation of the disk at this radius gives a trailing spiral , @xmath130 for @xmath131 .",
    "the interaction between the corotation perturbation and the magnetic perturbation of the disk is in general nonlinear .",

    "consider now higher rotation frequencies @xmath5 .",
    "note that the radial force perturbation includes a contribution of the form @xmath138 which again has a coherent term proportional to @xmath105 .",
    "we consider only the coherent term which can be written as @xmath139 , where @xmath140 real . in this case",
