    "the nearest - neighbor spin-1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice is an archetypal model of frustrated quantum magnetism .",
    "while the isotropic model in zero field is rather well - understood and is known to order into a coplanar `` 120@xmath2 '' state@xcite , away from this limit the situation is less clear .",
    "two deformations of the hamiltonian are of particular physical and experimental importance : the application of an external magnetic field and the introduction of spatial anisotropy into the exchange interactions .    the spatial anisotropy is introduced by decomposing the lattice into chains with bonds of strength @xmath0 , arranged into a parallel array , with inter - chain interactions of strength @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] ) . here , we define @xmath3 as the degree of anisotropy , and @xmath4 measures the applied magnetic field .",
    "there have been many extensive studies that consider these effects separately .",
    "however , a two - dimensional ( 2d ) phase diagram , taking both effects together , remains to be understood .",
    "this problem is of considerable experimental interest .",
    "the application of a magnetic field is one of the few general means to tune quantum magnets _ in situ _ , and provides very important information on the quantum dynamics , as well as clues to the underlying spin hamiltonian , which is often not well - known .",
    "two materials whose behavior in magnetic fields has been extensively studied are cs@xmath5cucl@xmath6 and cs@xmath5cubr@xmath6 , which are known to be approximately described by the spatially anisotropic version of the model , with larger anisotropy in the chloride ( @xmath7 ) than the bromide ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "both materials exhibit a rich structure of multiple phases in applied magnetic fields , for which a theoretical view of the phase diagram would be quite helpful .",
    "the solution of the ground state of a fully two dimensional frustrated quantum spin model in a two - parameter phase space is quite ambitious . here",
    ", we consider a somewhat simpler task , by concentrating on the problem defined by the model confined to a cylinder with a circumference of three lattice spacings ( i.e. making @xmath9 periodic with period 3 ) , which we refer to as a _ triangular spin tube _ , or tst ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lattice2 ] ) . by a combination of analytical approaches and extensive numerical simulations using the density matrix renormalization group @xcite ( dmrg )",
    ", we reveal a rich and complex phase diagram for the tst , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] .",
    "we argue in the discussion ( sec.[sec : discussion ] ) that much of this diagram translates to the fully 2d model .",
    "whenever possible , we use a nomenclature for the ground state phases which translates directly to two dimensions , though there are , of course , differences due to the absence of spontaneously broken continuous symmetry in one dimension .",
    "different parts of this phase diagram will be discussed in detail in the bulk of the paper , but we will highlight a few aspects here , where strong quantum features occur .",
    "first , the isotropic line , @xmath10 , as a function of magnetic field has been considered many times in the two - dimensional limit .",
    "there , semi - classical methods@xcite predict the stabilization of both coplanar spin configurations by quantum fluctuations , and , most interestingly , a magnetization plateau , at which the magnetization of the system is fixed ( at @xmath11 ) at 1/3 of the saturation magnetization over a range of magnetic fields . we will refer to this state as the  1/3 plateau \" throughout this text . on the plateau , the spins order into a collinear configuration .",
    "stabilization of such a plateau is very much a quantum effect and is one of the more striking quantum features of the tst .",
    "the presence of the plateau has been confirmed for both the one - dimensional @xcite and the two - dimensional spin-1/2 heisenberg models by exact diagonalization @xcite , coupled - cluster @xcite and variational @xcite methods .",
    "our dmrg study of the tst is also consistent with the semi - classical picture along the @xmath10 line .",
    "we directly confirm the two `` coplanar '' phases , and accurately locate the boundaries of the 1/3 plateau .",
    "another regime of strong quantum fluctuations occurs when @xmath12 is close to 1 , where the system is composed of weakly coupled ( strictly ) one dimensional ( 1d ) chains .",
    "there , an approach based on scaling and bosonization methods is possible , following refs .  .",
    "those techniques ( explained in this context in sec .  [ sec : weak - coupled ] ) predict a _ spin density wave _ ( sdw ) state over a wide range of applied fields . in this sdw state ,",
    "the dominant spin correlations are those of the ising component parallel to the field , in sharp contrast to the classical behavior .",
    "our dmrg simulations show that the sdw state dominates a remarkably broad region of the phase diagram , extending far beyond the decoupled line , @xmath13 .    in two dimensions , the quasi-1d approach of refs .",
    "shows the existence of a ( very narrow ) 1/3 plateau arising out of the sdw phase , leading to the speculation that the plateau persists for all @xmath12 in two dimensions . in the tst",
    ", we find that the plateau is also very robust , and persists almost , but not quite , to the 1d limit .",
    "the suppression relative to two dimensions can be understood as a result of enhanced fluctuations due to the one - dimensionality of the tst . to check this ,",
    "we have also carried out some dmrg studies of wider cylinders consisting of 6 and 9 sites in the periodic direction .",
    "our results appear consistent with the existence of a plateau for all @xmath12 in two dimensions .",
    "the last quantum regime we discuss here is clearly specific to the periodic boundary conditions imposed around the tst .",
    "this occurs at zero field , where for all values of @xmath12 , we observe a spontaneously dimerized ground state .",
    "the dimerization is most clearly observed in the entanglement entropy , which shows a pronounced oscillatory behavior along the chain .",
    "we argue that this can be understood as an effect of one - dimensional quantum fluctuations upon an underlying short - range spiral magnetically ordered state , somewhat similar to the formation of a haldane gap in integer spin chains with collinear classical states .",
    "the elementary excitations of the dimerized state are solitons , and we show how the behavior at small magnetization can be understood in terms of a dilute system of such solitons .    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dmrg ] we introduce the model and then describe key technical aspects of our dmrg simulations , including the procedure to determine the phase boundaries using the second derivative of the ground state energy and entanglement entropy , and careful finite size scaling . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iso ] , we review and compare the semi - classical predictions to the dmrg results in the isotropic limit .",
    "next , we discuss the high field region in sec .",
    "[ sec : high field ] . in the vicinity of the saturation field",
    ", the problem can be modeled as a dilute system of spin - flip bosons .",
    "we compare an analysis of this limit , built upon an analytic solution of the bethe - salpeter equation , to the dmrg , and find a transition between coplanar and cone phases , and a commensurate - incommensurate transition . in sec .",
    "[ sec : weak - coupled ] , we study the regime of weakly coupled chains , and in particular discuss the spin density wave ( sdw ) state and show that the 1/3 plateau terminates in a kosterlitz - thouless transition around @xmath14 for the tst .",
    "we consider the low field region in sec .",
    "[ sec : lowfield ] , showing the persistent dimerization , the evidence for solitons at small magnetization , and the commensurate to incommensurate transition near @xmath10 .",
    "dmrg numerical results will be presented throughout these sections , presenting the important features used to identify each phase .",
    "physical quantities , like entanglement entropy , vector chirality and the spin density profile will be shown for some representative large system size . finally , we conclude in sec .  [",
    "sec : discussion ] with a summary and discuss some generalizations of our results to larger spin and two - dimensional systems .",
    "the explicit hamiltonian studied in this paper is written as @xmath15 \\nonumber\\\\ & & - h \\sum_{x , y } \\mathbf{s}_{x , y}^z,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the direction along the chains , and @xmath9 is perpendicular to it , and @xmath4 is the magnetic field .",
    "importantly , we choose coordinates , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : lattice]b , where the triangular lattice is `` sheared '' to embed it in a square one .",
    "this is convenient for the application of periodic boundary conditions in the tst .",
    "many previous works on the anisotropic triangular lattice in two dimensions , including those by some of the authors@xcite , use instead `` cartesian '' coordinates , as shown in in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice]a . both for convenience in certain calculations ( especially in the quasi - one - dimensional limit ) , and to clarify the connection to this prior work , we give the relation between",
    "the sheared and cartesian coordinates here . in cartesian coordinates , we take the distance between sites along the chains and the ( normal ) distance between chains to unity . defining the cartesian",
    "coordinates as @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , then @xmath19 from this , we may also obtain the relationship between wavevectors in the two coordinate frames .",
    "we require @xmath20 , which implies @xmath21      throughout this paper , we rely extensively on dmrg simulations .",
    "for the present study , we kept up to @xmath22 states in the dmrg block , performing more than 24 sweeps to obtain fully converged results . in doing so",
    ", we find that our truncation error is of the order @xmath23 .",
    "we also take advantage of the cylindrical boundary condition to study large systems and to reduce finite - size effects for a more reliable extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit . in particular ,",
    "in the regions above the 1/3 plateau , we find that observables have much better convergence , with a truncation error of the order @xmath24 . even in the regions below the 1/3 plateau not close to the dimerized phase",
    ", we find reasonable convergence , with a slightly larger truncation error on the order of @xmath23 .",
    "however , when we approach the dimerized phase near zero magnetization , finite - size effects dominate : system sizes up to @xmath25 do not provide a reliable extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit .    the phase boundaries in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] were determined from the simulations .",
    "we describe the methodology for doing so here , leaving the characterization of the phases which occur for subsequent sections . for the case of continuous transitions , it is common to calculate the second derivative of the ground state energy , @xmath26 .",
    "the calculation follows standard procedure of using three data points at @xmath27 , @xmath12 , and @xmath28 , according to the formula @xmath29/dr^2 $ ] .",
    "the derivative diverges when the infinite - size system undergoes a transition . for finite systems",
    ", however , one will observe a finite peak that increases with system size .",
    "we then determine the phase boundaries numerically by looking at the peak position as a function of tuning parameter r. for example , as shown in fig.4 ( a ) , sharp peaks are located at r=0.6 .",
    "we observe that the peak value increases significantly with sample size , for all system sizes studied .",
    "we have not attempted to carry out detailed finite size scaling analyses of the peaks , as our focus here is on the phases , not the critical behavior at the transitions between them .",
    "this transition corresponds to the upper dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] , where there is a transition between an incommensurate planar and a cone phase .",
    "we use similar procedures to determine phase boundaries at other magnetizations , e.g. @xmath30 in figs .",
    "[ fig : de2](b , c ) correspond to the middle and lower dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] , respectively .",
    "in addition to these divergent peaks , there are some other features ( which are _ not _ phase transitions ) due to finite size effects .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : de2](a ) for @xmath31 , a broad peak near @xmath32 actually decreases ( and eventually goes to zero ) in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "therefore , we can confidently say that the cone phase dominates in the region @xmath33 , and that there is no transition at @xmath32 . similarly , for figs .",
    "[ fig : de2](b , c ) , the fluctuations in the plots near @xmath34 , respectively , are finite size effects and vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "finally , we use the structure factor @xmath35 to determine the boundaries between the commensurate and incommensurate phases .",
    "for example , for small @xmath12 , the transverse and longitudinal components of the structure factor peak at commensurate momenta @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "this defines the ",
    "c planar \" regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] .",
    "the isotropic model , @xmath38 , has been extensively studied in two dimensions , and it is believed that a semi - classical description , with weak quantum fluctuations included via spin wave theory , is qualitatively correct in this case@xcite .",
    "we find that the semi - classical analysis largely carries over to the tst , with small modifications to allow for one - dimensional fluctuations .",
    "therefore we review the established semi - classical results first .    in the classical limit , where spins are described as o(3 ) vectors , the isotropic problem is known to display an  accidental \" degeneracy in a non - zero applied magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that this model can be rewritten as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the sum of the spins on a triangle , and the sum is over all triangles on the lattice .",
    "the ground state configuration is given by the constraint @xmath41 at zero magnetization , this constraint is solved by placing all spins in a plane , with the three spins in each triangle at @xmath42 angles to one another in a three sublattice structure .",
    "a specific ground state is specified by three angles , e.g. two determining the plane of the spins and one determining the angle within the plane .",
    "all such states are related by o(3 ) spin symmetry ; so this is a symmetry - demanded degeneracy .",
    "a previous dmrg study@xcite on the 2d model also confirms the three sublattice structure .    in a non - zero field ,",
    "the ground states retain a three - sublattice structure , with three arbitrary angles remaining to determine the specific ground state .",
    "however , the presence of the field reduces the o(3 ) symmetry to o(2 ) ( or u(1 ) ) , and only one of these angular degrees of freedom is symmetry demanded .",
    "the remaining two angular degrees of freedom constitute an _ accidental _ degeneracy .",
    "two simple states within the degenerate manifold are the coplanar and umbrella ones , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comm - planar ] .    as first shown by chubukov and golosov  @xcite , this accidental degeneracy is lifted by quantum fluctuations .",
    "they showed by a @xmath43 spin wave expansion that the degeneracy is lifted in favor of the coplanar states .",
    "additionally , they demonstrated the existence of the 1/3 plateau , in which the spins adopt a 3 sublattice `` up up down '' structure .",
    "away from the plateau , the coplanar state retains a 3 sublattice structure with ordering wavevector @xmath44 , or @xmath45  @xcite . below the plateau ,",
    "the 3 spins form a `` y '' with one spin antiparallel to the field and two spins with equal positive projection to the field but at opposite angles from each other .",
    "this can be viewed as a deformation of the @xmath42 state with spins in a plane containing the magnetic field . here",
    "the spin configurations can be parametrized by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is an arbitrary angle specifying the plane of the spins , while @xmath48 are constants dependent upon the field magnitude . since @xmath49",
    ", we see from eq .   that when @xmath50 is a multiple of 3 , one of the spin is aligned with the magnetic field . above the plateau one finds instead a `` v '' configuration , with two spins identical and the third chosen to give zero moment normal to @xmath51 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath52 note that the cosine in the first line of eq .   never vanishes on lattice sites , so that spins are never parallel to the field in the v state .",
    "we will see that the semi - classical results summarized in the previous subsection for the two - dimensional case remain qualitatively correct , at least at short distances , in the tst . however , we must still account for the effects of quantum fluctuations on long length scales , since the one dimensional system _ can not _ break the u(1 ) spin - rotational symmetry about the field axis . since the u(1 ) symmetry is unbroken in the plateau state , there are no essential effects of one - dimensional fluctuations there .",
    "however , they have qualitative effects in the y and v phases , since @xmath53 there , in contrast to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : comm - planar1],[eq : comm - planar2 ] ) . note that the modulation of @xmath54 is perfectly consistent with one - dimensionality , and is expected to persist directly without qualitative modifications .    to incorporate one - dimensional fluctuations , we regard the semiclassical results in eqs .",

    "note that these formulae are _ not _ invariant under translations , reflecting the three - sublattice structure of the coplanar phases .",
    "this can also be seen from the oscillations in the @xmath59 expectation values .",

    "we turn to the situation in the one - dimensional tst .",
    "we argue that in this case the spiral order is converted by 1d quantum fluctuations into a fully gapped state with spontaneous _ staggered dimerization_. the argument is quite general and is expected to hold for any 1d system with local non - collinear order and a half - integer spin per unit cell . furthermore , specifically for the tst , we show that the tendency to short - range spiral order is _ more _ robust than in 2d , and unlike in 2d , it prevails over collinear order even in the limit of arbitrarily small @xmath533 .",
    "thus staggered dimerization is predicted at zero field for all @xmath656 for the tst .",
    "see appendix  [ sec : zero - field - analysis ] for an alternative calculation that leads to the same conclusion as the one presented below .    given the presence of dimerization in zero field , we can discuss the behavior in low fields , or more properly for small magnetization , in terms of the elementary excitations of the symmetry broken dimerized state , which are domain wall solitons .",
    "we obtain in this way different gapless phases at low field , including the sdw state discussed previously from the quasi-1d point of view .      in the following ,",

    "since this state is rooted in the one - dimensional limit , we consider just the limit of weakly coupled chains , for @xmath792 , and in particular @xmath806 .",
    "we find that the sdw is completely absent in this case .",
    "to see this , we consider a magnetic field above the lower critical field @xmath808 needed to overcome the non - zero haldane gap ( @xmath809 for @xmath286 ) .",
    "this turns the gapped ( and , essentially , decoupled ",

    "it turns out that these critical chains are characterized by a luttinger parameter @xmath810 for all values of the magnetic field above the gap - closing @xmath808.@xcite this immediately implies that the scaling dimension of the longitudinal spin density operator @xmath811 in is @xmath812 as well , which makes inter - chain sdw coupling in ( which has twice this scaling dimension ) strictly irrelevant .",
    "as a consequence the sdw phase does not occur in the quasi-1d limit . since this was its most stable regime in the @xmath793 case , it may well be that the sdw phase is totally absent for @xmath806 !",
    "it would be interesting to check this in future simulations .    what replaces the sdw ?",
    "the large value of @xmath813 implies an increased tendency to spin ordering transverse to the field direction , and indeed the twist term ( 4th term in ) is instead always relevant , leading to stabilization of the cone state .",
    "this result is supported by analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite studies of the spin 1 zigzag ladder .",
    "for example , ref .   finds a finite vector chirality ( that is , a cone state ) for all values of the magnetization in the case of @xmath814 spin-1 chain , along the @xmath815 line .",
    "note that above , we found that the cone state was also stabilized for small @xmath533 in the vicinity of saturation .",
    "it is likely then that the cone phase evolves smoothly between the 1d limit @xmath816 and the approach to saturation at finite @xmath533 .",
    "moreover , the presence of the cone state at small @xmath1 implies the absence of any magnetization plateau in that regime .",
    "the predictions appear quite similat to those of the semiclassical analysis of ref . , which suggests that the full phase diagram for @xmath806 might be well described semiclassically .",
    "it is clear that in particular the 1/3 plateau must terminate at some finite ( and perhaps not particularly small ) value of the @xmath533 ratio in this case .",
    "another experimentally - relevant modification of the spin-@xmath152 hamiltonian is three dimensional coupling .",
    "we consider the simplest case of unfrustrated antiferromagnetic inter - plane exchange interaction @xmath817 between identical triangular layers . provided the three dimensional coupling",
    "is unfrustrated , we expect that the particular form is not too important .",
    "such an interaction is expected to make the spin system more classical and thus to promote the classical cone state over the coplanar one .",
    "considering again the regime near saturation , one may readily solve the bs equation , appropriately modified to the three - dimensional situation .",
    "we indeed find that high - field co - planar configuration changes to the cone one for sufficiently large @xmath818 ratio .",

    "this is discussed in detail in sec.v of ref .. thus three - dimensional coupling , if unfrustrated , tends to remove all quantum features of the phase diagram .",
    "a variety of dm interactions can be present in anistotropic triangular lattice systems , depending upon the crystal symmetry and microscopic details .",
    "this can lead to diverse effects which are difficult to discuss without being more specific .",
    "for the materials cs@xmath5cucl@xmath6 and cs@xmath5cubr@xmath6 , the symmetry allowed dm interactions were obtained and discussed in detail in ref .. here we describe only the effects of the dominant dm term in those materials , which can be written as @xmath826 in the notation of this paper , with the dm - vector @xmath827 oriented along the crystallographic @xmath83 axis , normal to the triangular planes .",
    "though small , a non - zero @xmath828 has significant effects in both zero field and when a magnetic field is applied normal to the triangular plane , i.e. parallel to the dm - vector . in these situations , unlike the @xmath1 interchain coupling , it is not frustrated either by the dominant chain interactions @xmath0 or by the applied magnetic field .",
    "it tends to favor the cone state ( or a spiral in zero field ) , and can obliterate the more quantum coplanar and sdw phases completely if sufficiently strong in this field orientation . indeed , with this field orientation , an arbitrarily weak dm coupling inevitably forces the state in immediate proximity to the saturated state to be a cone phase , for all values of @xmath533 .",
    "this occurs because the dm coupling splits the degeneracy of the two minimum energy spin wave modes , already at the single spin wave level , making a two - component condensate impossible when the spin flip magnons are sufficiently dilute .",
    "we note , however , that when the magnetic field is applied normal to the @xmath83 axis , i.e. in the triangular plane , it itself frustrates the dm interaction .",
    "in this situation , the dm interaction is largely ineffective and has only minimal perturbative effects on the spin correlations .",
    "these field orientations are therefore optimal for observing quantum effects .",
    "our study indicates that a number of `` quantum '' ordered states may be found in @xmath793 anisotropic triangular lattice systems .",
    "these states are not so exotic as quantum spin liquids , and are well characterized by their symmetries and associated order parameters .",
    "they are instead quantum in the weaker sense that they can not be obtained in the classical limit .",
    "most notably , we obtained a sdw state whose order involves ( quasi-)periodic modulation of the _ length _ of the spin expectation value , along the field direction .",
    "we suggest this state occupies a wide swath of the field - anisotropy phase diagram , provided perturbations to our model are not too strong .",
    "the particular material cs@xmath5cubr@xmath6 appears a good candidate for the observation of the sdw state , since three - dimensional coupling is known to be relatively weak there , and experiments have already identified the 1/3 magnetization plateau .",
    "direct observation of the sdw would consist of observing the incommensurate ordering wavevector evolving monotonically with field , for fields above and below the plateau , and correlating this wavevector with the average magnetization .",
    "we expect it to approximately follow the 1d relation , @xmath829 , away from the plateau .",
    "given its 1d origin , one might well also expect that the inelastic spectra retain 1d features , such as spinon continua , in the sdw state and even in the plateau state above the gap .",
    "of course , at low energy , in the vicinity of the sdw wavevector , we expect the collective phason mode to dominate .",
    "there must therefore be significant rearrangement of the spectra on passing from low to high energy .",
    "a more detailed understanding of the spectral evolution with energy , field , and anisotropy may make an interesting subject for future study .    in cs@xmath5cubr@xmath6 ,",
    "many additional features suggestive of phase transitions were identified above the 1/3 plateau in the magnetization process with an in - plane field.@xcite   our study indicates that few such transitions should be expected in the pure @xmath830 model .",
    "likely additional dm interactions ( beyond the one given in eq .  ) and perhaps further - neighbor couplings are at play .",
    "study of their effects is a possible avenue for more research .",

    "no solitons are present , which implies the winding number @xmath860 precisely , and the ground state energy and field configuration are independent of @xmath489 .",
    "thus , there is no visible critical behavior in the ground state ( hence in equal time correlations ) in the commensurate phase . on the incommensurate side , however , the minimum energy configuration of @xmath861 depends upon @xmath489 .",

    "first , these properties have been implicitly obtained in the case of a three leg spin tube , slightly different from the one studied here , in ref .  .",
    "there , the authors explicitly evaluate the berry phase contribution to the action for instantons on the lattice .",
    "microscopically , the instantons are associated with columns of spatial _ links _ along the @xmath16-direction of the cylinder ( see below how this arises in another formulation ) .",
    "they showed that , due to the berry phase , a single pair of instantons ( an odd number of instantons can not occur ) is accompanied by a weight , @xmath1085 where @xmath16 and @xmath1086 are the locations of the instantons . for half - integer spins",
    ", this gives an oscillating factor equal to + 1 or -1 if the separation between instantons is even or odd , respectively . from this",
    "we can extract the transformation properties .",
    "if we translate _ one _ of the instantons , @xmath1087 , we see that the weight in eq .   changes sign .",
    "this requires @xmath1088 , in agreement with eq .  .",
    "under inversion , @xmath682 , about a lattice site , the instantons , which live on the links , change from the even to odd sublattice of bonds and vice - versa . inverting a single instanton , therefore , changes the parity of @xmath16 , and hence also the sign of the weight in eq .  .",
    "thus , again , @xmath680 is odd under inversion , in agreement with eq .  .",
    "since the instantons do not move under time - reversal or translation along @xmath9 , the invariance of @xmath680 under these operations is obvious .",
    "thus , for the case @xmath773 , for the model studied in ref .  , the symmetry of the instanton operator is determined as shown in the text .",
    "we turn now to an alternative derivation of the transformation laws , which gives the general result , and clarifies its generality . here",
    "we follow the general strategy of ref .  ,",
    "in which the @xmath677 vortices are explicitly separated from the smooth configurations of the so(3 ) order parameter using a slave particle construction .",

    "this representation faithfully reproduces the orthonormality constraints on the @xmath1092 , but is two to one : the physical order parameter @xmath1093 is unchanged by the transformation @xmath1094 .",

    "the topological defects of the spiral magnet become identified with the visons of the @xmath677 gauge theory .",
    "the discussion in the previous paragraph applies to @xmath677 vortices in two - dimensional space , which are particles in the 2 + 1-dimensional theory .",
    "we need to go from this to the description of instantons in the 1 + 1-dimensional theory obtained by applying periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "a 1 + 1-dimensional instanton can be viewed as an event in which a pair of @xmath677 vortices is nucleated : one of them winds around the cylinder and finally arrives back at the other @xmath677 vortex and annihilates it .",
    "we can , by the previous argument , consider the particles nucleated and annihilated to be visons in the gauge theory .",
    "such a process was considered in ref .",
    "( in the supplementary material ) , where it was shown that the operator representing this process in the ising gauge theory has the transformation properties in eqs .  ,",
    ", i.e. this operator can be viewed as a staggered dimerization operator for odd @xmath669 . there , a rectangular lattice gauge theory was studied , but the basic physics is quite general .",
    "let us consider the translation .",
    "we ask about the amplitude to first wind one vison around the cylinder at position @xmath16 , and then wind another at position @xmath1097 .",
    "the overall phase of the amplitude for both processes taken together gives the transformation property of the instanton operator under translation .",
    "the visons reside at the plaquette centers of the original lattice , and the winding trajectories form closed circles at fixed @xmath16 , circumnavigating the cylinder .",
    "together , these two events form two such circles that enclose one column of sites in the lattice .",
    "the fundamental property of a vison is that it has a mutual statistical interaction with `` electric '' gauge charges , with the wavefunction acquiring a phase of @xmath716 whenever one encircles the other . for a @xmath793 system ,",
    "a unit gauge charge is present at every lattice site  this represents the physical spin at each site .",
    "the net effect of the two events together is that one vison is wound around each site of the lattice between the two circles , leading to an overall amplitude of @xmath1098 for the two processes together . here",
    ", @xmath669 is the number of sites contained between the two circles .",
    "this gives the result in eq .  .",
    "note that we may also roughly understand this phase factor by considering the smooth rotations of microscopic spins between the two contours , all of which rotate by @xmath337 , and , due to their @xmath154 spinor transformation properties , each acquire a minus sign .",
    "a similar argument shows that spatial inversion gives the same phase factor .",
    "explicit calculations for these factors in the ising gauge theory can be found in ref .  .",
