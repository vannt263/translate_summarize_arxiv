    "pioneering studies of the impact of environment on galaxy properties have found higher density environments in the local universe to be dominated by elliptical and s0 galaxies @xcite .",
    "because of the strong correlation of hubble type with star formation rate ( sfr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a correlation between sfr and local galaxy density is expected and has been seen in more recent studies of the local universe @xcite .",
    "@xcite examined the sdss sample of @xcite and found a strong dependence of sfr on local galaxy density and stellar mass at @xmath5 . at a fixed stellar mass",
    ", they found the specific sfrs ( ssfrs ) , and therefore sfrs , of galaxies to be lower in higher density environments .    at @xmath6 , the morphology - density relation ( mdr )",
    "follows a similar trend to that found in the local universe for mass - limited samples @xcite .",
    "in contrast , recent analyses of the field at @xmath6 suggest that the sfr - density trend was the _ reverse _ at earlier times , where galaxies at higher densities display _ higher _ sfrs than galaxies at lower densities @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we explore the sfrs of galaxies in a redshift slice that includes the @xmath0 galaxy cluster rx  j0152.7 - 1357  ( hereafter rx  j0152 - 13 ) .",
    "our wide - field spectroscopic survey extends to a projected distance of @xmath2  mpc from the cluster center , resulting in a large number of galaxies that span a much broader range of environments at this epoch than is found in other work .",
    "our aim is to determine the form of the ssfr / sfr - density relation at @xmath8 and compare to the results discussed above at these redshifts and at @xmath5 .",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath9  km  s@xmath10  mpc@xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "stellar masses and sfrs are based on a chabrier imf @xcite .",
    "galaxies with @xmath1  mag from archival subaru suprime - cam wide - field imaging of rx  j0152 - 13  in @xmath13 were targeted over a @xmath14 fov with a low - dispersion prism ( ldp ) in the inamori magellan areal camera and spectrograph ( imacs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on magellan - baade .",
    "redshifts were determined by fitting the ldp spectra and suprime - cam broadband photometry with a grid of ( * ? ? ? * bc03 ) model templates as described in @xcite .",
    "the redshift extraction utilized a strong set of priors on the model galaxy templates , therefore we refrained from using any rest - frame quantities from the fitting in order to avoid any biases .",
    "we found a total of 1234  galaxies in the cluster redshift interval of @xmath15 .",
    "the survey has a high level of completeness ( median of @xmath16 for the sample discussed in this work ) and is remarkably uniform for different galaxy types ( e.g. red / blue , faint / bright ) while varying spatially from @xmath17 in the cluster core to @xmath18 at projected clustercentric radii of @xmath19  mpc . where required , galaxies were given weights based on a completeness map that is a function of @xmath20-band magnitude , @xmath21-@xmath20  color , and sky position . when compared to redshifts derived from higher resolution spectra ,",
    "the ldp redshifts display a @xmath22 biweight scatter of only @xmath23 in @xmath24 for galaxies in the redshift interval above .",
    "the scatter is the same for fainter galaxies ( @xmath25  mag ) , while red and blue galaxies have a scatter of @xmath26 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "thus , the ldp redshift uncertainties lack any significant dependence on the magnitudes and colors probed here , demonstrating their superiority over photometric redshifts that are typically challenged by these systematics .",
    "we used spitzer mips imaging at 24  to calculate sfrs .",
    "the mips imaging covers @xmath27 galaxies in a range of environments .",
    "we used the technique employed in @xcite to derive sfrs . at the mips @xmath28 detection limit of @xmath29  @xmath30jy , we measure a sfr of @xmath31  @xmath4  yr@xmath10  for galaxies at @xmath8 .",
    "while sfrs derived from the mips data represent the obscured component of star - formation ( sf ) , several authors have found this component to dominate the total sfr , especially for galaxies in the mass range discussed in this paper @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , more recent findings suggest sfrs inferred from the mid - ir may reflect sf activity over longer timescales ( 1@xmath322  gyr , * ? ? ?",
    "* kelson & holden 2009 in prep ) .",
    "finally , agn do not appear to contribute significantly to the overall mid - ir luminosity density at these redshifts @xcite or to the mid - ir luminosity of individual galaxies @xcite .",
    "stellar masses were computed by fitting our prism spectra and @xmath13 photometry with a suite of bc03 @xmath33-models at the derived prism redshift . at the redshift of rx  j0152 - 13  ( @xmath0 ) ,",
    "our sample reaches a limiting mass of @xmath3  @xmath4  ( @xmath3410.3 ) on the red - sequence . above this mass limit ,",
    "our sample consists of 330  galaxies with mips imaging .",
    "we compute the local projected galaxy density for each galaxy by measuring the distance to the 7th nearest neighbor with @xmath3  @xmath4  and relative rest - frame velocity @xmath35  km  s@xmath10  ( i.e. 2% of @xmath24 ) .",
    "we performed a stacking analysis of our mips imaging to determine the median sfrs for sub - samples divided by stellar mass and environment .",
    "most galaxies in higher density environments were not individually detected .",
    "therefore , a stacking analysis for galaxies in all environments allowed us to determine the median sfrs uniformly .",
    "all galaxies were included in the stacks , regardless of being detected at 24  .",
    "we used a bootstrap approach to determine the median sfr and its uncertainty for a stack of images . as a check on this technique , we compared the median flux computed from a stack of detected sources to the median value of the individual fluxes , and found them to agree to within @xmath36 .",
    "we used the median of the stack , as opposed to the mean , because it was less susceptible to being influenced by bright contaminating sources .",
    "figure  [ mipsstack_ps ] shows the median image for different mass - density bins .",
    "we find a detection for the median stacked galaxy in each bin .",
    "galaxies were stacked in 2 bins of mass above our mass limit , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and 4 bins of local density that were divided at @xmath39 , 10 , and 32  mpc@xmath40 , with the density range of the extreme bins unbounded .",
    "we used wide density bins given the large scatter between dark matter halo mass and local projected galaxy density ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * fig .",
    "figure  [ stack_mips_density ] shows the median ssfr vs. local density for galaxies in two mass bins .",
    "the median mass of galaxies in each mass - density bin was used to compute sfr / m ( i.e. ssfr ) .",
    "the error bars for the ssfrs reflect the uncertainty on the sfrs from the bootstrap analysis and the uncertainty in the median mass of each bin .",
    "there is a clear correlation between ssfr and density , with galaxies at higher densities having lower ssfrs .",
    "this is true for galaxies in both mass bins .",
    "furthermore , at fixed density the lower mass galaxies have higher ssfrs .",
    "note that because the ssfr - density trends are shown for a given mass bin , it implies that the sfr also declines across the entire density range .",
    "it also implies that the overall decline in ssfr with density is not due to any change in the mass function between the low - density field and the high - density cluster environment since the ssfr declines with density at a fixed mass .",
    "figure  [ stack_mips ] emphasizes this point .",
    "the figure shows the median ssfr vs. stellar mass for galaxies in three density bins .",
    "the density bins have been recast from figure  [ stack_mips_density ] to roughly reflect the division between the cluster , groups , and field . at a fixed mass ,",
    "galaxies in the highest density bin have ssfrs that are @xmath41 times lower than galaxies in the low - density bin .",
    "note that the median @xmath8 field data from @xcite agree with the median ssfrs of galaxies in our lowest density bin , indicating that this bin is representative of the general field .",
    "also note that the @xcite points roughly lie between the ssfrs of the two lowest density bins in figure  [ stack_mips_density ] , implying that we in fact sample a range of field environments .",
    "figure  [ stack_mips ] also shows the median ssfr trends for galaxies in the lowest ( @xmath42 ) and highest ( @xmath43 ) density environments at @xmath5 from @xcite .",
    "these @xmath5 total sfrs were derived from extinction corrected h@xmath44 luminosities . in our @xmath8 sample the mips derived sfrs",
    "dominate the total , allowing us to compare our ssfrs to those from @xcite .",
    "although our density estimators were not computed in a similar manner , by comparing galaxies at the lowest and highest densities in both samples we can compare and contrast galaxies at the two extremes at both epochs .    above the mass completeness limit , galaxies at all densities in our @xmath8 sample are forming stars at a higher rate relative to galaxies with the same stellar mass at @xmath5 .",
    "one should note however , that the bulk of sf has already taken place for most of these galaxies , even by @xmath8 , since most lie below the dashed line in figure  [ stack_mips ] that indicates the ssfr at which stellar mass doubles by at @xmath45 if the sfr remains constant .    at @xmath5",
    ", @xcite found a factor of @xmath46 spread in sfrs at @xmath47 between their lowest and highest density bins , with galaxies at high densities having lower sfrs . at @xmath8",
    ", we found a similar result .",
    "for galaxies with mass @xmath48 , the spread in sfrs at @xmath5 is smaller than the factor of @xmath46 we find .",
    "this is likely because @xcite assigned a limiting ssfr of @xmath49  yr@xmath10  to galaxies with non - detectable sf .",
    "the median sfrs have not been corrected for contamination from galaxies in lower density bins , but we note that such a correction would lead to an even stronger decline in ssfr with increasing density .",
    "recent work at @xmath6 indicates that for galaxies in the mass range studied here , several relations follow trends similar to those found at @xmath5 . for example , @xcite and @xcite found a strong mdr for mass - limited samples in both the field and clusters at @xmath6 .",
    "thus , it should not be surprising that we see a similar trend for the ssfr / sfr - density relation at @xmath8 as we see at @xmath5 ( although with a different normalization ) .",
    "interestingly , some recent studies of galaxies at low - redshift find evidence for enhanced levels of dust - obscured sf at densities slightly above typical field densities , although they also generally find an overall trend of decreasing sf activity at higher densities @xcite .",
    "our result of a declining sfr in higher density environments appears universal at @xmath8 and not confined to a cluster environment , much like the mdr and sfr - density relations in the local universe .",
    "as seen in figure  [ stack_mips_density ] , cluster galaxies dominate the highest density bin , but much of the decrease in ssfr occurs in lower density field bins .",
    "in addition , after removing galaxies within @xmath50 times the virial radius of the cluster , we continue to find the ssfr to decrease with density , including in the remaining high density regions represented by several groups at projected distances of @xmath51  mpc from the cluster .",
    "this decrease in ssfr occurs over a similar range of densities in which @xcite found an increase in the red galaxy fraction , possibly linking the end of sf and buildup of red - sequence galaxies in environments that reach into the dense regions of the field .",
    "in contrast to our work , @xcite and @xcite found very different results for the sfr - density relation . at @xmath52",
    ", @xcite found a factor of @xmath41 spread in sfrs .",
    "however , they found galaxies at higher densities to have _ higher _ mean sfrs up to a critical density , above which the sfr declined .",
    "much of the reversed sfr - density trend in @xcite is driven by a peak in the sfr in a narrow projected density range of @xmath53  dex ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "likewise , @xcite also found the sfrs of galaxies to increase in higher density environments at @xmath55 , although their observed spread in sfrs was less than a factor of @xmath56 . while neither of these two surveys contain a cluster , both sample group environments similar to the groups around rx  j0152 - 13  that have velocity dispersions ( @xmath57  km  s@xmath10 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that are typical of groups found in the field @xcite",
    ". however , the reversal in the sfr - density relation found by @xcite and @xcite does not extend into the highest densities found in their group environments .",
    "sample selection plays an important role in interpreting the different results . while we use a mass - limited sample , @xcite and @xcite use luminosity - limited samples that are biased to include low - mass blue star - forming galaxies and exclude the corresponding non - star - forming red galaxies .",
    "when restricted to a mass - limited sample that was similar to the one in this work , @xcite found the ssfr continued to increase from low - density to high - density but with marginal significance ( see fig .",
    "20 in that work ) .",
    "@xcite found the mean sfr to increase with density by @xmath58 while for the same sample the mean ssfr _ decreases _ by @xmath58 over the same density range , which implies an increase in the mean mass with density by a factor of @xmath59 .",
    "the inferred range of mean mass ( @xmath60 ) from @xcite is below our mass threshold .",
    "however , the small rise in sfrs with density seen by @xcite can be explained by the presence of relatively more high mass galaxies , which have higher sfrs @xcite , at higher densities in their sample .",
    "interestingly , we note that when selecting a luminosity - limited sample that was similar to either of these works , we found the sfr to continue to decrease at higher densities , but at a much shallower pace for lower mass galaxies .",
    "this did not depend strongly on the sub - sample of galaxies that were used to compute local densities ( i.e. luminosity vs. mass - limited ) .",
    "we note that contaminants from low - density environments , which we found to have higher levels of sf , likely contribute to the shallower trend .",
    "recent observations of a `` star - forming sequence '' in the field at @xmath5 @xcite and up to redshifts of @xmath6 @xcite suggest that galaxies populate a narrow distribution of ssfrs at a fixed stellar mass .",
    "below this sequence is a more extended distribution of galaxies with very low ssfrs that are effectively non - star - forming . here",
    ", we investigate whether the ssfr - density trend represents ( 1 ) a changing mix of galaxies that lie on or off of the star - forming sequence or ( 2 ) a change in the sfrs of star - forming galaxies in different environments . without additional constraints , our mips stacking analysis alone can not distinguish between these two scenarios .",
    "using our previous results on the correlation between the red galaxy fraction and density @xcite , we can speculate on which of these scenarios is more likely .",
    "in @xcite we found the fraction of blue galaxies increased by a factor of @xmath61 from @xmath62 in the highest density regions to @xmath63 at the lowest densities .",
    "if the typical sfr of galaxies on the star - forming sequence remains constant and the ratio of blue - to - red galaxies reflects the ratio of galaxies that are forming stars or not then one expects the average sfr ( and ssfr within a single mass bin ) in the high density regions to be diminished by a factor of @xmath61 compared to the field , roughly what we see in the mips stacking analysis presented here .",
    "the notion that galaxies are either star - forming or not is given additional credence by @xcite and @xcite who found that the dominant mode of sf at these epochs was in moderate starbursts when accounting for the duty cycle of such events .    in summary , we find that at @xmath8 , the ssfrs and sfrs of galaxies with @xmath3  @xmath4  decrease in higher density environments , and this is true over the entire range of environments studied .",
    "this result follows the trend observed at @xmath5 in which @xcite also found galaxies at higher densities to have lower ssfrs , but with ssfrs that were @xmath61 times higher at @xmath8 .",
    "our result differs from that of @xcite and @xcite who found a reversal in the sfr - density trend at @xmath6 over some portion of their density range , mostly driven by sf in lower mass galaxies present in their luminosity - limited samples . in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we plan to utilize rest - frame uv data with sed fitting to determine total sfrs of individual galaxies at @xmath8 .",
    "the distribution of sfrs in different environments will allow us to probe the processes that were responsible for shutting down sf at a time when the universe was half its current age .",
