    "many techniques and algorithms have been proposed for digital image segmentation .",
    "unfortunately , traditional segmentation techniques using low - level , such as thresholding , histograms or other conventional operations are rigid methods .",
    "automation of these classical approximations is difficult due to the complexity in shape and variability within each individual object in the image .",
    "mean shift ( msh ) is a robust technique which has been applied in many computer vision tasks .",
    "msh as an iterative algorithm has been used in many works by using the entropy as a stopping criterion @xcite .",
    "+ entropy is an essential function in information theory and has special uses for images data , e.g. , restoring images , detecting contours , segmenting images and many other applications @xcite .",
    "however , in the field of images , the range of properties of this function could be increased if the images would be defined in @xmath0 rings .",
    "+ in this paper , we compare the stability of iterative msh algorithm using a new stopping criterion based on ring theory with respect to the stopping criterion used in @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : theoretical aspects related with the entropy and the defined images in @xmath0 ring are exposed in section [ theorical aspect : entropy ] . here",
    ", a special attention is dedicated to the benefits of image entropy in the @xmath0 ring .",
    "section [ experiments and results ] shows the experimental results , comparisons and discussion . and",
    "finally the most important conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "entropy is a measure of unpredictability or information content . in the space of the digital images",
    "the entropy is defined as @xcite .",
    "the entropy of the image @xmath1 is defined by @xmath2 where b is the total quantity of bits of the digitized image @xmath1 and @xmath3 is the probability of occurrence of a gray - level value . by agreement @xmath4 .    in recent works @xcite",
    "the entropy is an important point to define a stopping criterion for a segmentation algorithm based on an iterative computation of the mean shift filtering . in @xcite",
    "the stopping criterion is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the function of entropy and the algorithm is stopped when @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively the threshold to stop the iterations and the number of iterations .",
    "[ weakly equivalent ] two images @xmath1 and @xmath10 are weakly equivalents if @xmath11 we denote the weak equivalent between @xmath1 and @xmath10 using @xmath12 .",
    "trivial implication is : @xmath13 note that using the definition [ weakly equivalent ] the stopping criterion defined in ( [ old criterion ] ) is a measure to know when two images are close to be weakly equivalents .",
    "+ figure [ different images comparation ] shows two different images of @xmath14 .",
    "a reasonable stopping criterion should present a big difference between figure [ one_a ] and figure [ two_b ] .",
    "however , by using the expression ( [ old criterion ] ) , we obtain that @xmath15 .",
    "the defined stopping criterion in ( [ old criterion ] ) never consider the spacial information between the images @xmath1 and @xmath10 .",
    "for this reason , it is possible to have two very different images and to obtain a small value by using ( [ old criterion ] ) .",
    "+ this is a strong reason to consider that the defined stopping criterion in ( [ old criterion ] ) is not appropriate and provide instability in the iterative mean shift algorithm . for this reason ,",
    "it is necessary to consider other stopping criterion that provides a better performance . + it is natural to think that two images are close if their subtraction is close to zero .",
    "the problem of this idea is that , in general , when the subtraction gives negative values many authors consider to truncate to zero these elements .",
    "this consideration , in general , it not describe the difference between two images , and in some cases , it is possible to lose important information .",
    "+ for this reason , it is necessary to define a structure such that the operations between two images are intern .",
    "the @xmath0 ring is the partition of the set of integers @xmath16 in which the elements are related by the congruence module @xmath17 .",
    "mathematically speaking , we say that @xmath18 is in the class of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) if @xmath18 is related by @xmath21 with @xmath19 , where @xmath22 consequently @xmath23 .",
    "+ if we translate the structure of the @xmath0 ring to the set of images of size @xmath24 where the pixel values are less that @xmath25 and we denote this set as @xmath26 , we obtain the next result .",
    "[ theorem ring matrix ] the set @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively the pixel - by - pixel sum and multiplication in @xmath0 , has a ring structure .",
    "as the pixels of the image are in @xmath0 , they satisfies the ring axioms .",
    "the operation between two images was defined pixel by pixel , then is trivial that @xmath26 under the operations @xmath30 of the @xmath0 ring inherits the ring structure .    in this moment",
    ", we have an important structure where we can operate with the images . in the ring @xmath27 the sum",
    ", subtraction or multiplication of two images always is an image .",
    "we say that two images @xmath31 are strongly equivalents if @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a scalar image .",
    "we denote the strong equivalence between @xmath1 and @xmath10 as @xmath34 .",
    "note that if @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the additive inverse of @xmath33 .",
    "this is calculated using the inverse of each pixels of @xmath33 in @xmath0 .",
    "if two images @xmath1 and @xmath10 are strongly equivalents then they are weakly equivalents .    if @xmath1 and @xmath10 are strongly equivalents then @xmath38 where @xmath33 is a scalar image .",
    "then @xmath39 but @xmath33 is a scalar image and for this reason the sum @xmath40 only change in @xmath10 the intensity of each pixel but do nt change the number of different intensities or the frequency of each intensity in the image .",
    "then , @xmath41 .",
    "finally we obtain that @xmath42 and they are weakly equivalents .    note that the shown images in figure [ different images comparation ] are weakly equivalents , but they are not strongly equivalents .",
    "this is an example that in general @xmath43 .",
    "[ definition new stop ] let @xmath1 and @xmath10 two images , then the natural entropy distance is defined by @xmath44    remember that @xmath45 is the additive inverse of @xmath10 and this is calculated using the inverse of each pixel of @xmath10 in @xmath0 .",
    "if it are considered the images of figure [ different images comparation ] , the results show that @xmath46 .",
    "this is more reasonable result .",
    "+ the next theorem is an important characterization of the strong equivalent among images .",
    "two images @xmath1 and @xmath10 are strongly equivalent if and only if @xmath47 .",
    "if @xmath1 and @xmath10 are strongly equivalents @xmath38 where @xmath33 is the scalar image . then we have @xmath48 @xmath49 because @xmath33 is a scalar image .",
    "it is demonstrated that @xmath50 .",
    "+ on the other hand if @xmath51 , where @xmath33 is a scalar image .",
    "adding @xmath10 in the last equation we obtain that @xmath38 , therefore @xmath52 .",
    "taking in consideration the good properties that , in general , the natural entropy distance has ( see definition [ definition new stop ] ) , one sees logical to take the condition ( [ definition equation new ] ) as the new stopping criterion of the iterative mean shift algorithm .",
    "explicitly , the new stopping criterion is @xmath53 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively the threshold to stop the iterations and the number of iterations .",
    "image segmentation , that is , classification of the image gray - level values into homogeneous areas is recognized to be one of the most important step in any image analysis system .",
    "homogeneity , in general , is defined as similarity among the pixel values , where a piecewise constant model is enforced over the image @xcite .",
    "+ the principal goal of this section is to evaluate the new stop criterion in the iterative mean shift algorithm and to prove that , in general , with this new stopping criterion the algorithm have better stability . for this aim",
    ", we used three different images for the experiments .",
    "the first image (  bird \" ) have low frequency , the second (  baboon \" ) have high frequency and in the image  montage \" has mixture low and high frequencies .",
    "+ all segmentation experiments were carried out by using a uniform kernel . in order to be effective the comparison between the old stopping criterion and the new stopping criterion , we use the same value of @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the iterative mean shift algorithm ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath55 is related to the spatial resolution of the analysis , while the value @xmath54 defines the range resolution . in the case of the new stopping criterion",
    ", we use the stopping threshold @xmath57 and when the old stopping criterion was used , we selected @xmath58 .",
    "+ figure [ test images ] shows the segmentation of the three images .",
    "observe that , in all cases , the iterative mean shift algorithm had better result when was used the new stopping criterion .",
    "+ when one compares figures [ bird_new ] and [ bird_old ] , in the part corresponding to the face or breast of the bird a more homogeneous area , with the new stopping criterion ( see arrows in figure [ bird_old ] ) , it was obtained .",
    "observe that , with the old stopping criterion the segmentation gives regions where different gray levels are originated .",
    "however , these regions really should have only one gray level .",
    "for example , figure [ baboon_new ] and [ baboon_old ] show that the segmentation is more homogeneous when the new stopping criterion was used ( see the arrows ) . in the case of the  montage \"",
    "image one can see that , in figure [ montage_old ] exists many regions that contains different gray levels when these regions really should have one gray level ( see for example the face of lenna , the circles and the breast of the bird ) .",
    "these good results are obtained because the defined new stopping criterion through the natural distance between images in expression ( [ definition stop criterion new ] ) offers greater stability to the mean shift iterative algorithm .",
    "+   +    figure [ profile test ] shows the profile of the obtained segmented images by using the two stopping criterion .",
    "the plates that appear in figure [ profile new ] and [ profile old ] are indicative of equal intensity levels . in both graphics the abrupt falls of an intensity to other represent the different regions in the segmented image .",
    "note that , in figure [ profile new ] exists , in the same region of the segmentation , least variation of the pixel intensities with regard to figure [ profile old ] .",
    "this illustrates that , in this case the segmentation was better when the new stopping criterion was used .",
    "figure [ iterations ] shows the performance of the two stopping criterion in the experimental images . in the",
    " @xmath59 \" axis appears the iterations of the mean shift algorithm and in the ",
    "@xmath60 \" axis is shown the obtained values by the stopping criterion in each iteration of the algorithm .",
    "+ the graphics of iterations of the new stopping criterion ( figure [ iterations_new_bird ] , [ iterations_new_baboon ] , [ iterations_new_montage ] ) show a smooth behavior ; that is , the stopping criterion has a stable performance through the iterative mean shift algorithm .",
    "the new stopping criterion not only has good theoretical properties , but also , in the practice , has very good behavior .",
    "+ on the other hand , if we analyze the old stopping criterion in the experimental images ( figure [ iterations_old_bird ] , [ iterations_old_baboon ] , [ iterations_old_montage ] ) , we can see that the performance in the mean shift algorithm is unstable . in general",
    ", we have this type of situation when the stopping criterion defined in ( [ old criterion ] ) is used",
    ". this can originate bad segmented images .",
    "in this work , a new stopping criterion , for the iterative mean shift algorithm , based on the ring theory was proposed .",
    "the new stopping criterion establishes a new measure for the comparison of two images based on the use of the entropy concept .",
    "we introduced a new way to operate with images based on the use of the ring structure .",
    "the rings in the images space were defined using the concept of @xmath0 rings . through the obtained theoretical and practical results , it was possible to prove that the new stopping criterion had very good performance in the iterative mean shift algorithm , and in general , it was more stable that the old criterion @xcite .",
