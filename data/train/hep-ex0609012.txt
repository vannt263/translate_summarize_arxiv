    "the fermilab tevatron is a @xmath2 collider , operating at a centre - of - mass energy @xmath3 . during run  ii ( in run  i ,",
    "the tevatron operated at @xmath4 ) , the two large , general purpose experiments cdf and d have collected an integrated luminosity of approximately @xmath5 per experiment , at the time of writing . the results presented here have been obtained with integrated luminosities of up to @xmath6 .    in the following , results on inclusive @xmath0 and @xmath1 boson production cross sections , the @xmath0 boson charge asymmetry and the @xmath1 boson rapidity distribution will be given .",
    "the experimental results will be compared with predictions from the standard model , in particular quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , at next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) and at next - to - next - to - leading - order ( nnlo ) .",
    "in @xmath2 collisions at the tevatron energy , @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons are predominantly produced through the annihilation of a valence quark from the proton and a valence anti - quark from the anti - proton .",
    "the probability for such a @xmath7 annihilation to happen ( _ i.e. _ , the cross section ) is perturbatively calculable from the standard model .",
    "corrections due to gluon exchange in the @xmath7 pair or gluon emission from the ( anti- ) quark are known from qcd . the probability to find a quark of a certain momentum inside the proton",
    "is known from experimentally determined parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) .",
    "a measurement of inclusive or differential @xmath0 and @xmath1 boson production cross sections therefore provides tests of both qcd and pdf s .",
    "in addition , many other physics processes of interest , such as top - quark decays , involve electroweak bosons .",
    "a precise experimental understanding of these bosons is thus a benchmark for other analyses . also , since theoretical predictions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 boson production are quite accurate",
    ", a measurement of the production rate can serve as a tool to determine the integrated luminosity",
    ". this will be especially useful at the large hadron collider .",
    "the electroweak bosons are detected in their leptonic decay modes . in case of the @xmath0 boson ,",
    "the experimental signature is events with a single high @xmath8 lepton ( electron or muon ) and a large missing transverse energy ( ) due to the undetected neutrino . with cuts on @xmath8 and typically set at 20 to 25@xmath9",
    ", about 1  million candidates are selected per inverse femtobarn of integrated luminosity .",
    "background in this sample is small , and is composed of so - called qcd background and electroweak boson background .",
    "qcd background in the muon channel is dominated by semi - leptonic decays of charm and bottom hadrons , and amounts to approximately 1% of the @xmath0 boson candidate sample . in the electron channel , jets with an electron signature form the qcd background ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the electroweak boson backgrounds are due to leptonic decays of @xmath1 bosons where one of the leptons is not identified ( @xmath11 in the muon channel , @xmath12 in the electron channel ) , and @xmath13 decays ( @xmath14 in both channels ) .",
    "@xmath1 boson decays are selected as events with two high @xmath8 leptons ( @xmath15 ) . for each inverse femtobarn of integrated luminosity , this gives a sample of about @xmath16 candidates .",
    "backgrounds are very small .",
    "qcd background is @xmath12 in the muon channel and @xmath10 in the electron channel .",
    "the only other significant source of background is from @xmath17 decays ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 or @xmath1 boson production cross section ( times the branching fraction ) can be determined as follows : @xmath19 where the number of candidates is given by @xmath20 .",
    "the backgrounds ( given by @xmath21 ) , as described in the previous section , are estimated from the data itself ( for the qcd backgrounds ) or from monte carlo simulations of standard model predictions ( for the electroweak boson backgrounds ) .",
    "the efficiency @xmath22 to correctly identify and select a @xmath0 or @xmath1 boson is typically determined from the data , with an uncertainty of @xmath23 .",
    "the experimental acceptance @xmath24 is calculated from monte carlo simulations of @xmath0 or @xmath1 boson production .",
    "the uncertainty on the acceptance is @xmath25 , and is dominated by uncertainties in the pdf s .",
    "finally , the integrated luminosity ( @xmath26 ) is measured by independent luminosity systems .",
    "current results on @xmath0 and @xmath1 boson cross section measurements at the tevatron are shown in figure  [ fig : wzcs_vs_sqrts ] .",
    "the largest systematic uncertainty on these measurements ( @xmath27 ) is due to the measurement of the integrated luminosity ( @xmath28 for the run  ii points ) .",
    "the solid line in these figures represents an nnlo qcd prediction@xcite .",
    "there is good agreement between the experimental points and the prediction .",
    "note that cross sections in the @xmath29 decay channel have also been measured .",
    "these are important benchmarks for higgs and new physics searches .",
    "typically , pdf s are parameterized as a function of @xmath30 , the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the quark , and @xmath31 , the momentum transfer between the quark and anti - quark . at leading order ,",
    "the rapidity of a @xmath0 boson ( @xmath32 ) is related to @xmath30 via @xmath33 .",
    "a measurement of the @xmath0 boson production cross section at large @xmath32 is therefore sensitive to pdf s at small and large @xmath30 . in its turn",
    ", the pseudorapidity @xmath34 of the lepton from a @xmath0 boson decay is correlated with the rapidity of the @xmath0 boson .",
    "this implies that leptons at large @xmath34 ( _ i.e. _ , in the forward detectors ) come from @xmath0 bosons with a large rapidity on average , whereas leptons at small @xmath34 ( in the central detectors ) are due to @xmath0 bosons with small rapidity .",
    "the cdf collaboration has exploited this in a measurement of the @xmath0 boson production cross section using electrons in the forward calorimeters ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "after a full correction for the limited acceptance of the forward calorimeters , the resulting cross section times branching fraction is : @xmath36 this number is in good agreement with the cross section from electrons in the central detector ( @xmath37 ) and with the predicted cross section .",
    "note that this measurement is also shown in figure  [ fig : wzcs_vs_sqrts ] ( `` cdf ( e pl ) '' ) .",
    "a first - order test of pdf s is obtained by taking the ratio of the visible cross section ( defined as @xmath38 ) in the central and forward detectors .",
    "the cross section uncertainty due to the pdf s cancels in this ratio , and the uncertainty due to the integrated luminosity is reduced .",
    "this cross section ratio is equivalent to the ratio of @xmath0 boson acceptances for forward and central electrons .",
    "the cdf result is : @xmath39 the uncertainties on the expected ratios are dominated by the pdf uncertainty .",
    "it can be seen that the measured ratio ( eq .  [ eq : cs_ratio_measured ] ) is in excellent agreement with the predictions using the cteq pdf s ( eq .  [ eq : acc_ratio_cteq ] ) and in good agreement with the mrst prediction ( eq .  [ eq : acc_ratio_mrst ] ) .",
    "it is clear that just this @xmath40 measurement is already sensitive to the pdf s .",
    "on average , the u - quark in the proton carries a larger fraction of the proton s momentum than the d - quark .",
    "this implies that at production , a @xmath41 boson is typically boosted in the @xmath42 direction .",
    "this leads to a charge asymmetry , as a function of @xmath32 .",
    "a measurement of this asymmetry is directly sensitive to the pdf s .",
    "the momentum of the neutrino in a @xmath0 boson decay is not fully reconstructible , which implies that @xmath32 is not fully reconstructible .",
    "however , some of the original asymmetry is preserved in the pseudorapidity distribution of the decay - lepton .",
    "both the d ( muon channel ) and cdf ( electron channel ) collaborations have measured the lepton charge asymmetry , defined as : @xmath43 these measurements probe a region in @xmath44 that is not probed by , e.g. , hera experiments .",
    "the main experimental challenge is to keep the lepton - charge misidentification rate low ( @xmath45 for d s muon channel ; @xmath10 for cdf s electron channel ) , and to understand possible charge - dependencies of selection efficiencies .",
    "the result of d s measurement , based on @xmath46 , is given in figure  [ fig : wasym_d0_muon ] . even though the uncertainties on the experimental points are dominated by the finite data - sample - size",
    ", some sensitivity to pdf s is already obtained ( assuming the @xmath0 boson decays according to the standard model ) .",
    "thus , with more data , this measurement will constrain the pdf s .",
    "a description of the cdf measurement ( @xmath47 ) can be found in ref .",
    "cdf split up the final data sample in two bins ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) to get additional pdf sensitivity .",
    "the rapidity of a @xmath1 boson ( @xmath50 ) produced in a @xmath2 collision is also sensitive to the u- and d - quark momentum fractions in the proton .",
    "as opposed to the @xmath0 boson rapidity , the rapidity of the @xmath1 boson is fully reconstructible .",
    "however , u- and d - quark contributions can not be separated .",
    "the result of a measurement by the d collaboration of @xmath50 in the electron channel ( @xmath51 ) is given in figure  [ fig : zrapidity_d0 ] .",
    "a good agreement with an nnlo prediction@xcite is observed , but the data sample is still too small to be sensitive to pdf s .",
    "precision measurements of inclusive and differential @xmath0 and @xmath1 boson production cross sections at the tevatron have been performed .",
    "the results agree well with standard model predictions .",
    "measurements of lepton charge asymmetries as a function of lepton rapidity are already sensitive to pdf s . in the near future , an order of magnitude more data will be analyzed .",
    "this will provide a better determination of pdf s , which in its turn is important for reducing systematic uncertainties on , for example , the @xmath0 boson mass measurement ."
