    "in condensed matter physics , one of the major challenges is to understand the strong correlation effect in interacting electron systems . the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe )",
    "systems@xcite are primary examples , where new quantum phases emerge with fractional quasiparticle excitations@xcite resulting from such effect .",
    "theoretical understanding@xcite of the odd denominator fqhe states in the lowest landau level @xmath4 has been fully developed soon after the experimental discovery@xcite .",
    "the even denominator@xcite quantum hall states in second landau level @xmath5 appear to demonstrate complex nature beyond the understanding of a unified theory , which are under intensive studies@xcite .",
    "theoretical approaches@xcite have predicted a variety of possible candidate states for even - denominator quantum hall systems , some of which are exotic in nature with quasiparticles obeying non - abelian statistics .",
    "however , very often such theories can not provide solutions to microscopic theoretical models describing realistic electron systems . in this aspect",
    ", computational studies have played an important role to determine the quantum state for such systems .",
    "pioneer works have been done using exact diagonalization ( ed ) method to establish the nearly perfect overlap of the laughlin wave function with the exact ground state wavefunction of small electron systems and provide microscopic understanding of the nature of the fqhe @xcite . in recent years , ed has been widely used to study fqhe for pure systems@xcite as well as disordered systems@xcite to probe the nature of various quantum phases and transitions .",
    "it has been recently established that ed can also be used to identify the topological nature of a quantum phase based on entanglement entropy and the entanglement spectrum of the quantum systems@xcite . however , since the hilbert space increases exponentially with the system size , ed is limited to systems with a small electron number ( typically restricted to electron number @xmath6 depending on the landau level filling number ) .",
    "this limitation becomes a severe problem when the finite - size effect is strong , which is usually the case for quantum states in the higher landau levels or with even denominator filling fractions .",
    "the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) developed by white is a powerful method for studying interacting systems with accuracy controlled by the number of states kept in dmrg blocks@xcite .",
    "it has been widely applied to quasi - one - dimensional systems , providing essentially exact results for spin or electron systems .",
    "however , its application to two - dimensional systems remains to be quite challenging .",
    "it is generally believed that the number of states desired to be kept in each block should grow exponentially with the increase of the system width to catch up the entanglement entropy between two coupled blocks@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , fqhe systems can be modeled as one dimensional system with long - range coulomb interaction , which may become accessible using current computational power .",
    "shibata and yoshioka made the first attempt to develop dmrg algorithm to study quantum hall systems in torus geometry@xcite about ten years ago .",
    "various fillings have been studied@xcite by keeping hundreds of states obtaining useful information of larger systems at integer fillings or for compressible states .",
    "recently , a great progress has been made by feiguin @xmath7@xcite developing new dmrg algorithm keeping up to 5,000 states in their work .",
    "the hard problems of the incompressible fqhe at @xmath0 and @xmath1 have been extensively studied , providing convincing high accuracy ground state and excited state results for larger system sizes up to 20 and 26 electrons at @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "moreover , dmrg has also been applied to study bosonic quantum hall effect@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study fqhe systems based on our newly developed dmrg code , which substantially improves the accuracy of the results through keeping more states and managing dmrg process with higher efficiency .",
    "the benchmark results and error analysis are presented for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . for the same system",
    "sizes studied before , we reduce the error substantially especially for @xmath1 systems , while we access systems with more electrons with high accuracy .",
    "we also obtain accurate entanglement spectra for @xmath2 systems , which identify the topological order at larger system sizes .",
    "the entanglement gap for @xmath2 fqhe first revealed by li and haldane@xcite based on ed calculation , remains finite in the thermodynamic limit established through finite - size scaling analysis .",
    "in this paper , we study the fqhe in the spherical geometry@xcite , where electrons are confined on the surface of a sphere with radius @xmath8 . the total magnetic flux through the spherical surface @xmath9 are quantized to be an integer @xmath10 multiple of the flux quanta .",
    "assuming that electrons are polarized by the magnetic field and neglecting the landau level mixing , the hamiltonian in the spherical geometry can be written as @xmath11 where the @xmath12 is the z - component of the angular momentum and @xmath13 , with @xmath14 being the total angular momentum and @xmath15 is the landau level index .",
    "@xmath16 is the coulomb interaction between electrons in units of @xmath17 , with @xmath18 being the magnetic length . in the next sections",
    ", we also use the renormalized magnetic length @xmath19 to rescale the energy unit if it is mentioned explicitly@xcite .",
    "@xmath20 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator at the orbital @xmath21 .",
    "the problem can be naturally studied using the dmrg method in momentum space@xcite as nonzero matrix elements in the eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) only exist between orbitals satisfying the angular momentum conservation relation @xmath22 .    in our dmrg process , we arrange the @xmath23 orbitals into a one - dimensional chain , corresponding to states with z - component of the angular momentum @xmath21 taking different values @xmath24 from left to right . in the initial process , we start from a small system with two blocks ( each block has only one orbital ) and two single orbitals in the middle forming a configuration @xmath25 .",
    "we write the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) terms using the product of block operators and single site operators@xcite and diagonalize the hamiltonian to obtain the ground state .",
    "the reduced density matrix is formed and diagonalized by following the standard dmrg@xcite procedure . a new block @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is formed by including the single site into the current block .",
    "this procedure is repeated until the 1d chain grows into the desired system size with 2l+1 orbitals . from this point ,",
    "the finite - size sweeping algorithm is employed until we obtain the converged results .",
    "is shown at ( a ) @xmath0 and @xmath28 , with 1,600 ( @xmath29 ) , 3,200 ( @xmath30 ) , and 5,000 ( @xmath31 ) states kept , respectively .",
    "the triangle data(obtained by keeping 5,000 states ) illustrate a situation where drmg runs into a local minimum during initial 12 sweeps , see text for details .",
    "the reference ground state energy is -0.4210509 , obtained by dmrg with at most 24,000 states kept .",
    "( b ) @xmath2 and @xmath32 with 1,600(@xmath29 ) , 3,200(@xmath30 ) , and 5,000(@xmath31 ) states kept , respectively .",
    "the data showed by @xmath33 are obtained by keeping 8,000 , 10,000 and 14,000 states for each 4 sweeps starting from the first sweep , and 16,000 states for the rest of sweeps .",
    "the reference ground state energy is -0.3876150 , obtained by dmrg with at most 30,000 states kept .",
    ", width=264 ]    using our momentum space dmrg , the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is diagonalized in the sector with fixed electron number @xmath34 and the total angular momentum z - component @xmath35 . in the initial process of the calculation",
    ", only a small fraction of the momentum sectors in each block contributes significantly to the ground state wavefunction .",
    "states in other sectors , which have zero eigenvalues in reduced density matrix , are being discarded .",
    "however , these discarded states may become also important to the ground state wavefunction in the later stage when system grows to the full length@xcite . to overcome this problem",
    ", we need to keep additional sectors from very beginning . for this purpose",
    ", we set a minimum number of sectors @xmath36 , which in practice is about @xmath37 times larger than the number of sectors after convergence . in each of selected sectors",
    ", we keep at least two states with largest eigenvalues in the sector .",
    "the remaining states are selected following the standard dmrg procedure to minimize the truncation error . in the sweep process , @xmath36 is gradually decreased as a function of sweep number .    in fig .",
    "[ benchmark](a ) , we show the error of the obtained ground state energy per electron at @xmath0 for different number of states kept in each block with respect to the fully converged reference energy obtained by keeping much more states .",
    "a reasonable accuracy around @xmath38 is reached with the electron number @xmath28 ( bigger than the largest ed size by six electrons ) by keeping only @xmath39 states , while we achieve the accuracy of @xmath40 by keeping @xmath41 states .",
    "however , the convergence becomes more difficult for @xmath2 system , as we show in fig .",
    "[ benchmark](b ) . for @xmath32 ( bigger than the largest ed size by four electrons ) , with @xmath42 states kept ,",
    "the accuracy we can achieve is about @xmath43 , comparable with the results obtained by feiguin et al@xcite . further increasing the number of states kept to @xmath44 , we are able to reduce the error by a factor of five .",
    "controlling @xmath36 also allows us to overcome the local minimum trapping , which could trap the dmrg obtained state in an excited state . as we show in fig .",
    "[ benchmark](a ) by triangles , the energy is pinned to a local minimum from the fifth sweep to twelfth sweeps , and the error is much larger than the data showed by @xmath31 starting from a different initial state . to overcome the problem , we simply increase @xmath36 at the twelfth sweep to allow a larger number of sectors to get into the hilbert space .",
    "these additional sectors bring in significant quantum fluctuations and eventually get the state out of the local minimum .",
    "to demonstrate the accuracy of our dmrg calculations , we have obtained the ground state energy for system up to 24 electrons at @xmath0 by keeping up to @xmath45 states , which leads to a truncation error smaller than @xmath46 in the final sweep .",

    "we rescale the energy by the renormalized magnetic length@xcite and extrapolate the numerical data linearly , leading to @xmath53 demonstrating consistency between two extrapolating methods . while our results are essentially in agreement with previous results recently obtained by feiguin et al@xcite using dmrg method , our accuracy is improved by keeping much more states , which opens opportunity for studying larger systems .",
    "now we turn to the study of the fqhe at @xmath2 .",

    "the maximum dimension of the space we diagonalize is around @xmath54 .",

    "this is different from the finite - size wavefunction overlaps between the wavefunction of a realistic interacting system and model wave - functions ( laughlin or moore - read wavefunctions ) as such overlaps have to go to zero with the increase of the system size related to the presence of the generic entanglement spectrum in the system .",
