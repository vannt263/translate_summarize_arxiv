    "five years ago , our knowledge about galaxy evolution still had a glaring gap between redshifts 1.5 and 3 , termed the redshift desert .",
    "the desert is even more desolate for galaxy chemical evolution studies , where high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) spectra are needed for reliable measurements .",
    "however , great progress has been made in the last few years in studying galaxies at z@xmath13 2 and we are beginning to harvest the  desert \" . to date , metallicities are available for a few tens of individual galaxies at @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "these galaxies are selected using broad - band colors either in the uv ( lyman break technique ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or using @xmath5 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16-band colors ( bzk selection ; * ? ? ?",
    "the lyman break and @xmath17 selection techniques favor the galaxies that are luminous in the uv or blue and could therefore be biased against low luminosity ( low - metallicity ) galaxies , and dusty ( potentially metal - rich ) galaxies .    to date",
    ", metallicity measurements for high - redshift ( @xmath18 ) galaxies have been made via indirect methods from the ratios of strong nebular lines . in local galaxies ,",
    "the preferred method for determining metallicity is via the  direct \" @xmath4 method which relies on the electron temperature sensitivity of the [ oiii]@xmath14363 line . at high redshift ,",
    "metallicity measurement via the direct method has not been possible because the [ oiii]@xmath14363 line used to derive the electron temperature is very weak .",
    "the highest redshift that the [ oiii]@xmath14363 line has been reported is at @xmath19 by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "strong lensing by galaxy clusters offers an alternative tool to explore the metallicity of galaxies at high - redshift .",
    "one advantage of lensing selected galaxies is that they are immune to color and luminosity biases .",
    "previously , only five lensed galaxies had been observed with sufficient spectral coverage and s / n to yield metallicities @xcite .",
    "compared with lyman break selected galaxies in the same redshift and luminosity range , the five lensed objects span a substantially broader metallicity range ( 12+log(o / h)@xmath137.19.1 ) , indicating that current metallicity history studies at @xmath20 ( 12+log(o / h)@xmath138.48.8 ) may not be sampling the full metallicity range at this redshift .",
    "it is worth noting that the metallicity range quoted for the lensed galaxies is extremely uncertain , depending on various assumptions about reddening and metallicity calibrators .",
    "another great advantage of gravitational lensing is its natural magnification of the source .",
    "the flux of the lensed background galaxy is commonly boosted by a factor of 1 - 3 mag or more around the critical lines of the cluster center .",
    "optical spectroscopic surveys of high - z galaxies near cluster critical lines have already yielded a large catalog of lensed galaxies beyond z @xmath131 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , spectra from these surveys can not be directly utilized in metallicity studies because the commonly used metallicity diagnostic emission lines have shifted into the near infrared ( near - ir ) at @xmath21 .    with the revolutionary multi - object cryogenic near - ir spectrographs that have been recently installed on 8 - 10 m class telescopes , high efficiency near - ir spectroscopy is now available .",
    "we carried out the first near - ir spectroscopic survey of lensed galaxies behind lensing clusters , aimed at measuring the metallicity of galaxies at @xmath14 .",
    "this letter reports the rest - frame optical spectrum of a strongly lensed star - forming galaxy at @xmath22 behind the abell cluster 1689 from our ongoing survey .",
    "the galaxy cluster abell 1689 was chosen as our first target because it has the largest einstein radius of @xmath23 @xcite , and nearly @xmath13 100 spectroscopically confirmed lensed images @xcite .",
    "the galaxy in question is designated as i d 22.3 in the catalog of @xcite , we refer to it as lens22.3 hereafter . throughout",
    "we use the standard lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath24cdm ) cosmology with @xmath25 km s@xmath26 mpc@xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the data were obtained on 2008 march 26th , using the multi - object infrared camera and spectrograph ( moircs ) at _ subaru _",
    "@xcite , in the spectroscopic mode @xcite .",
    "we used the low - resolution grism zj 500 with a nominal resolution of 500 and a wavelength coverage of 0.91.78 @xmath29 m . we designed two masks targeting the spectroscopically confirmed lensed images in the field of abell 1689 .",
    "we obtained useable data for one mask . during the observation for this mask , the seeing varied between 0.@xmath303 and 0.@xmath306 , and the airmass ranged between 1.1 and 1.7 .",
    "lens22.3 was placed at one of the center slits of the mask , with a slit width of @xmath31 and a slit length of @xmath32 .",
    "the telescope was nodded along the slit in a abab mode with a dithering length of 2.@xmath305 .",
    "the exposure time for each individual frame was 400 - 600 seconds , resulting in a total integration time of 6800 seconds .",
    "we reduced the data using the standard iraf and idl routines .",
    "sky oh lines were removed by subtracting the closest dithering pair a and b. a scaling factor between each pair was determined to optimize the sky subtraction .",
    "the sky subtracted a - b pair was flat - fielded , cleaned for comic rays , and then traced and rectified using a dome flat spectrum .",
    "the final two - dimensional spectrum was created by co - adding the reduced individual pairs .",
    "wavelength calibration was carried out using the strong oh lines between 0.9 and 1.8 @xmath29 m .",
    "a f5v standard star was observed at approximately the same airmass as the target .",
    "the telluric absorption was obtained by dividing the star spectrum with a fitted blackbody curve .",
    "the resulting stellar spectrum was then divided into the object spectrum to correct for telluric absorption .",

    "the instrument response is essentially constant for the wavelength range from [ oiii]@xmath14363 to [ oiii]@xmath15007 .",
    "the h@xmath12   line lies in the region where the response has dropped by @xmath42 .",

    "metallicities were calculated using the following two methods .",
    "_ 1 . strong line diagnostics . _ in the absence of direct measurements from electron temperature , the ratio of strong nebular lines is used to determine the oxygen abundance .",
    "the well - known discrepancies between the different line ratio indicators can be removed by converting to the same base calibration following the methods of @xcite .",
    "we use the indicator @xmath44=([oii]@xmath13727 + [ oiii]@xmath454959 , 5007)/h@xmath37 to calculate metallicity . in our case",
    ", the upper and lower branch degeneracy of @xmath44 can be broken by the upper limit of [ nii]/h@xmath12@xmath460.005 .",
    "in addition , the detection of the weak [ oiii]@xmath14363 line almost certainly means the adoption of the lower branch . for the actual calculation",
    ", we use the lower branch calibration of @xcite ( m91 method ) in the analytical form given by @xcite .",
    "the resulting metallicity is  8.0 in the m91 method .",
    "converted to the @xcite method ( kd02 ) , we have  8.1 assuming zero extinction , or 8.3 assuming a high extinction value of e(b - v)=0.4 @xcite",
    ". the high extinction value agrees with the direct estimate from the h@xmath12/h@xmath37  in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "however , because the h@xmath12   line lies near the edge where the response has dropped by @xmath42 , the ratio of h@xmath12/h@xmath37  can be largely uncertain because it depends sensitively on the precision of correction for the detector response . therefore instead of using only the high extinction from h@xmath12/h@xmath37 , we use two extreme values of extinction to quantify the range of uncertainty caused by extinction .",
    "note that the logarithm in the definition of 12+log(o / h )  means that 10% of change in the line ratio causes only @xmath13 0.04 dex change in metallicity .",
    "the uncertainty for our derived metallicity is therefore @xmath33 0.1 dex prior to extinction correction .",
    "_ 2 . direct metallicity from electron temperature @xmath4 . _",
    "the auroral line [ oiii]@xmath14363 is often very weak , even in low metallicity environments .",
    "it is usually not observed in high metallicity galaxies without very sensitive , high s / n spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the 3 @xmath41 detection of [ oiii]@xmath14363 in lens22.3 strongly suggests a low metallicity environment .",
    "the ratio of [ oiii]@xmath15007 , 4959 and [ oiii]@xmath14363 allows a direct measurement of the oxygen abundance via electron temperature @xmath4 .",
    "we use the nebular package in iraf to derive the electron temperature @xmath47=2.3557 @xmath8 10@xmath48 k , assuming an electron density n@xmath49 of 100 @xmath50 ( @xmath47 is relatively insensitive to @xmath51 , e.g. , for @xmath51=1000 @xmath50 , @xmath47=2.3508 @xmath8 10@xmath48 k ) . following the procedure of @xcite , we obtain 7.5 @xmath7 0.1 assuming zero extinction ; or 7.3 @xmath7 0.1 assuming a high extinction value of e(b - v)=0.4 .    the 0.6 dex discrepancy between the kd02 and @xmath4 method",
    "is not surprising since the metallicity measured from the direct @xmath47 method is systematically lower than other methods ; such offsets can be as large as 0.7 dex @xcite .",
    "regardless of the offset between the two methods , both metallicity estimates indicate that lens22.3 is low in oxygen abundance .",
    "the evidence that lens22.3 is a star - forming galaxy instead of a narrow line agn comes from its position on the traditional baldwin",
