    "final state interaction ( fsi ) effects in b decay was expected to play only the role of a small correction to the standard description in short distance amplitude . in factorization approach",
    ", the amplitude of a b decay mode which is describe the short distance contributions , consists of 1 ) the usual factorization amplitude of color - allowed and color - suppression , 2 ) the annihilation topology ( w - exchanged or w - annihilation )  @xcite .",
    "in pure annihilation b decay mode , the theoretical amplitude is often too small in comparison to expected date . in this decay mode",
    "fsi effects may play an important role .",
    "where after a weak decay , the intermediate state particles re - scatter into the final particles through a nonperturbative strong interaction .",
    "the nonperturbative nature of fsi effects makes it difficult to study in systematic way so some different mechanisms of the rescattering effects have been considered  @xcite . to analyze a b - meson decay through fsi , it is important to understand the structure of the intermediate multiparticle states .",
    "one can treats fsi as the soft rescattering processes of intermediate two - body hadronic states e.g. @xmath9 and omit the other intermediate multi - body states , where after weak decay of b - meson to two light mesons , they rescatterd to two new mesons through nonperturbative strong interaction . the hadronic loop level ( hll ) is used in the strong interaction process where it is obtained from the effective chiral lagrangian  @xcite . +",
    "our result for qcdf approach was @xmath7 where the leading order results for coefficients @xmath10 was used and the correction terms was omitted .",
    "experimental result is less than @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "since , the results from qcdf approach is very small , the fsi effect can may give a sizeable correction where the intermediate states are @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons .",
    "we calculated the @xmath12 decay according to the hll method . in this case , the branching ratio is @xmath13 .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the qcdf approach and calculated the amplitudes of the main decay and the intermediate states through qcdf approach . then , in section 3 we present the fsi effects and calculated the amplitude of @xmath14 decay from three possible intermediate states . in section 4",
    "we give the numerical results , and in the last section we have a summery .",
    "to calculate the amplitudes of the pure annihilation b decay modes we use the qcd factorization method where we just consider the annihilation topology .",
    "we consider b - quark decay and use the convention that @xmath15 meson contain an anti - quark ( quark ) from the weak vertex with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the final mesons  @xcite .",

    "while the endpoint divergence is regulated in perturbative qcd approach by introducing the parton s transverse momentum , it is parametrized in qcd factorization by modifing @xmath36 whith @xmath37  @xcite , so we replace eq .",
    " by : @xmath38 different @xmath39 are allowed for four cases : pp , pv , vp and vv where p(v ) is a final meson by pseudoscalar ( vector ) polarization . for vv case ,",
    "in  @xcite , by evaluating the convolution integrals with asymptotic distribution amplitudes @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , we find the simple expressions @xmath43 now we can calculate the weak amplitude of the @xmath12 decay and the intermediate state . according to the annihilation diagrams of the @xmath44 decay which is given in fig.2 the pure annihilation amplitude is given by @xmath45     decay ]",
    "to consider the fsi effects in @xmath12 decay , we must extract the accessible intermediate states and calculate the weak amplitude of them . according to the fig.3 , by considering the @xmath46 part of the @xmath47 mesons while tow intermediate mesons and final state mesons , exchange the same quark ( u - quark ) , @xmath48 and @xmath48 meson can be produced for the intermediate state via exchange @xmath49 meson .",
    "likewise when two intermediate mesons exchange d - quark ( s - quark ) and two final state mesons exchange u - quark , @xmath2 ( @xmath50 @xmath51 ) mesons can be produced for the intermediate state via exchange @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) mesons . and",
    "by considering the @xmath54 part of the @xmath47 mesons while the two intermediate mesons exchange d - quark ( u - quark or s - quark ) and two final state mesons exchange d - quark , @xmath1 ( @xmath2 or @xmath55 ) mesons can be produced for the intermediate state via exchange @xmath49 ( @xmath52 or @xmath53 ) meson .    .",
    "]    now that the intermediate states obtained , we can calculate the weak amplitude of these intermediate states which produced in @xmath56 decay modes where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the intermediate state mesons . in tow case , @xmath48 @xmath48 and @xmath2 , we calculate the amplitude is similar to the @xmath59 decay mode since these decay modes are pure annihilation .",
    "so according to sec.2 , we have @xmath60 but in the other cases , the color - allowed and color - suppression topology are allowed and we must consider the usual factorization approach  @xcite to calculate the amplitude .",
    "so we have @xmath61 where the coefficients @xmath62 correspond to the penguin topology and is defined as : @xmath63 in the qcd factorization amplitude , all terms are not expected to be equally large . the color - allowed and color - suppression topology ( @xmath64 terms ) which invole form factors are dominate and the annihilation topology ( @xmath20 terms ) can be neglected  @xcite .",
    "+ likewise we have : @xmath65   a_4 v_{tb } v^*_{td } \\nonumber \\\\ & & -f_{b_s } f_{k^*}^2 v_{tb } v^*_{td } ( 2b_2)\\bigg\\rbrace,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath66 @xmath67    v_{ub } v^*_{ud } a_1 \\rbrace \\nonumber \\\\ & & + i g_f f_{b_s } f_{k^*}^2 \\lbrace   v_{ub } v^*_{ud } b_1 + v_{tb } v^*_{td } ( b_4-b_{4,ew})\\rbrace.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "at the quark level , final state re - scattering can occur through quark exchange and quark annihilation .",
    "the quark level diagram for @xmath68 decay is shown in fig.3 .",
    "this decay has only quark annihilation mode , since the final mesons ( @xmath69 ) have the same flavour quark - antiquark . in practice , it is extremely difficult to calculate the fsi effects , but at the hadronic level formulated as re - scattering processes with s - channel resonances and one particle exchange in the t - channel .",
    "s - channel resonant fsi effects in @xmath68 decay is expected to be vanished because of the lack of the existence of resonances . therefore , one can model fsi effects as re - scattering processes of two body intermediate state with one particle exchange in the t - channel and compute the absorptive part via the optical theorem  @xcite .",
    "so , according to the hadronic loop level ( hll ) diagram , shown in fig.4 , the absorbtive part of the amplitude calculated with the following formula @xmath70 where the @xmath71 is the amplitude of the decay of the b meson to the intermediate state and @xmath72 involves the hadronic vertices factor , which are defined as @xmath73 the magnitude of the effective couplings can be extracted from experimental  @xcite . as an example , the effective coupling @xmath74 is relevant to the @xmath75 process shown in fig.5 .",
    "+    so , for diagram ( a ) in fig.4 the absorptive part of the amplitude of the @xmath76 proses where @xmath77 meson is exchanged particle at t - channel is given by @xmath78 where the @xmath79 is the angle between @xmath80 and @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the four momentum of the exchanged k meson and @xmath83 @xmath84 is a form factor or a cut - off which is introduced to that hadronic vertices takes care of the off - shell effect of the exchanged particle .",
    "here we have followed  @xcite while in  @xcite different form is used .",
    "so we have @xmath85 the parameter @xmath86 is the off - shellnes compensating in function @xmath84 which is not an universal parameter , but is should be near the mass of the mesons involved in the effective coupling .",
    "+ likewise , for the diagram ( b ) in fig.4 , the absorptive part for the @xmath87 proses where @xmath88 meson is exchanged particle at t - channel is given by @xmath89 where @xmath90+p_3 ^ 0\\big[p_4 ^ 0(p_1.p_2)\\nonumber \\\\ & & -(p_2 ^ 0-|\\overrightarrow{p_2}|)(p_1.p_4)\\big]+ ( p_1 ^ 0-|\\overrightarrow{p_1}| ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times\\big[(p_2 ^ 0-|\\overrightarrow{p_2}|)(p_3.p_4)-p_4 ^ 0(p_2.p_3)\\big].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as the bridge between the dispersive part of the fsi amplitude and the absorptive part , the dispersion relation is @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the square of the momentum carried by the exchanged particle and @xmath93 is the threshold of intermediate states , in this case @xmath94 .",
    "+ finally the amplitude of the @xmath95 decay via hll diagram is @xmath96 likewise , we can calculate the fsi effects comes from other intermediate states ( @xmath97 and ( @xmath98 ) by replacing @xmath99 with these new intermediate states in above formula .",
