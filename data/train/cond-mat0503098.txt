    "in low - dimensional quantum spin systems quantum fluctuations often lead to disordered ground states that exhibit no magnetic ordering and a gapped , non - degenerate singlet ground state .",
    "such states , also called spin liquids , are realized in one dimension in dimerised or frustrated spin chains , even - leg spin ladders as well as in the two dimensional shastry - sutherland ( shs ) model.@xcite srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 is a quasi - two - dimensional spin system with a unique spin - rotation invariant exchange topology that leads to a singlet dimer ground state .",
    "@xcite since this compound represents the only known realization of the shs model , it recently became a focal point of theoretical as well as experimental investigations in the field of frustrated spin systems .",
    "consequently , many fascinating physical properties of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 have been discovered .",
    "increasing external magnetic field leads to a formation of magnetization plateaus @xcite which are a consequence of repulsive interaction between almost localized triplets .",
    "weak anisotropic spin interactions can have disproportionately strong effect in a frustrated system .",
    "it has recently been shown , that the inclusion of the nearest neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest neighbor ( nnn ) dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) interactions is required to explain some qualitative features of the specific heat near the transition from the spin dimer to the spin - triplet state , as well as to explain the low frequency lines observed in electron spin resonance experiments in srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite    the existence of the spin gap , almost localized spin - triplet excited states , as well as the proximity of a spin - liquid ground state of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 to the ordered antiferromagnetic state , lead to rather unusual low - temperature properties emerging in inelastic neutron scattering ( ins),@xcite raman scattering ( rs ) @xcite as well as in electron spin resonance ( esr ) experiments .",
    "@xcite in particular , ins normalized peak intensities of single- , double- and possibly triple - modes show a rapid decrease with temperature around 13  k , well below the value of the spin gap energy @xmath3",
    "k. in addition , authors of ref .",
    "@xcite show , that properly normalized complement of static uniform spin susceptibility , obtained with almost identical model parameters as in the present work,@xcite nearly perfectly fits their experimental data . similar behavior is found in rs data where a dramatic decrease of raman modes , representing transitions between the ground state and excited singlets , with increasing temperature at @xmath4 is observed .",
    "moreover , at @xmath5 all rs modes become strongly overdamped.@xcite    numerical simulations of dynamical spin structure factor based on exact diagonalization on small clusters at zero temperature show good agreement with ins data.@xcite recently developed zero - temperature method based on perturbative continuous unitary transformations @xcite gives very reliable results for the dynamical spin structure factor of the shs model since the method does not suffer from finite - size effects .",
    "the method is , however , limited to calculations at zero temperature and , at least at the present stage , it does not allow for the inclusion of dm terms .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate finite temperature properties of the dynamical spin structure factor of the shs model using the finite temperature lanczos method ( ftlm),@xcite and to compare results with ins data.@xcite in our search for deeper physical understanding of spectral properties of the shs model at finite temperatures we compare those with thermodynamic quantities , such as : the specific heat , entropy , and uniform static magnetic susceptibility , which we further compare with analytical results of the isolated dimer ( dim ) model .",
    "we finally present results of the @xmath2-dependent static magnetic susceptibility as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "to describe the low - temperature properties of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 we consider the following heisenberg hamiltonian defined on a 2d shastry - sutherland lattice : @xcite @xmath7 here , @xmath8 and @xmath9 indicate that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are nn and nnn , respectively .",
    "a recently published high - resolution ins measurments on srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 @xcite motivated us to choose @xmath12  k ( in units of @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 .",
    "a slightly different choice of parameters ( @xmath15  k , @xmath14 ) has been used previously in describing specific heat measurements @xcite and esr experiments on srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0.@xcite we should note , however , that this fine - tunning of parameters leads to effects , visible only on small energy scales , thus leaving previous calculations @xcite practically unaffected .",
    "in addition to the shastry - sutherland hamiltonian , @xmath16 includes dm interactions to nnn with the corresponding dm vector @xmath17 .",
    "the arrows indicate that bonds have a particular orientation as described in ref .",
    "its value , @xmath18 , successfully explains the splitting between the two single - triplet excitations observed with esr @xcite and ins measurements.@xcite    as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , a finite nn dm term should also be taken into account to explain specific heat data and esr experiments .",
    "we have chosen to omit this term since it does not significantly affect results of the dynamical spin structure factor at a non - zero value of the wavevector .",
    "we have chosen the quantization axis @xmath19 to be parallel to the @xmath20-axis and @xmath21 to the @xmath22-axis pointing along the centers of neighboring parallel dimers .",
    "we use the ftlm based on the lanczos procedure of exact diagonalization , combined with random sampling over initial wave functions . for a detailed explaination of the method and a definition of method parameters",
    "all the results are computed on a tilted square lattice of @xmath23 sites with @xmath24 first and @xmath25 second lanczos steps , respectively .",
    "the full trace summation over @xmath26 states is replaced by a much smaller set of @xmath27 random states giving the sampling ratio @xmath28 .",
    "comparing ftlm with the conventional quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods we emphasize the following advantages : ( a ) the absence of the minus - sign problem that usually hinders qmc calculations of frustrated spin systems , ( b ) the method connects the high- and low - temperature regimes in a continuous fashion , and ( c ) dynamic properties can be calculated straightforwardly in the real time in contrast to employing the analytical continuation from the imaginary time , necessary when using qmc calculations . among the shortcomings of ftlm is its limitation to small lattices that leads to the appearance of finite - size effects as the temperature is lowered below a certain @xmath29 . due to the existence of the gap in the excitation spectrum and the almost localized nature of the lowest triplet excitation",
    ", we estimate @xmath30  k at least for calculation of thermodynamic properties.@xcite finite - size effects also affect dynamical properties as , e.g. , the dynamical spin structure factor , which is ( even at finite temperatures ) represented as a set of delta functions . in particular , finite - size effects affect the frequency resolution at low temperatures , while at higher temperatures as more states contribute to the spectra , its shape becomes less size dependent .",
    "we should stress that ftlm was in the past successfully used in obtaining thermodynamic as well as dynamic properties of different correlated models as are : the @xmath31-@xmath32 model,@xcite the hubbard model,@xcite as well as the shs model.@xcite",
