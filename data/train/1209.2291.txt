    "\" active galactic nuclei ( e.g. osterbrock 1988 , netzer 2008 ) . according to the current paradigm ,",
    "lines originate in the so  called broad line region ( blr ) , where dense ( @xmath9 @xmath10 ) clouds of gas , possibly part of a disk wind ( e.g. , emmering et al .",
    "1992 , elvis 2000 , trump et al .",
    "2011 ) , moving with keplerian velocity around the black hole ( bh ) , are photo",
    " ionized by the optical  uv emission of the central regions of the accretion disk . from the typical spectrum one can infer some of the basics properties of the clouds ( temperature , density , composition ; e.g. , kaspi & netzer 1999 , korista & goad 2000 ) and , using the so  called  reverberation mapping \" technique ( e.g. , peterson & wandel 2000 ) , also their distance from the bh ( e.g. kaspi et al . 2000 , 2007 , bentz et al .",
    "2009 ) which can be used , in combination with the observed line width , to infer the mass of the bh ( e.g. mclure and dunlop 2001 ) . despite the decades of intense studies , some of the basic facts concerning the blr are still under debate .",
    "in particular it is unclear whether the blr is spherical or , instead , it is characterized by a  flattened \" geometry ( e.g. shields 1978 ) , as expected in the case of a disk wind and as proposed for narrow  line seyfert 1 galaxies , to reconcile the usually small inferred black hole masses with those of the broad line sy1 ( decarli et al .",
    "concerning the specific case of radio  loud agn , several studies concluded that a flat geometry is favorite .",
    "for instance , early in the eighties wills & browne ( 1986 ) found a correlation between the width of the @xmath11 line and the core  to  extended radio flux at 5 ghz suggesting a blr concentrated in the plane normal to the jet axis .",
    "similar results have been more recently obtained by jarvis & mclure ( 2006 ) .",
    "decarli , dotti & treves ( 2011 ) find the evidence that line width in blazars ( in which , plausibly , the accretion disk is observed nearly on  axis ) is smaller than in not aligned quasars , again suggesting that the blr is flat , with an average thickness  radius ratio , @xmath12 .",
    "the bright @xmath1ray ( @xmath13 mev ) emission from blazars , in particular the powerful flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) , is widely interpreted as produced through to the inverse compton scattering of soft photons by the relativistic electrons in the jet whose synchrotron continuum accounts for the low frequency ( ir  optical ) bump in the sed .",
    "the nature of the soft target photons is however still matter of debate : besides the synchrotron photons themselves ( maraschi et al . 1992 ) and the (  external \" ) optical  uv photons from the broad line clouds ( sikora et al . 1994 ) , possible other external sources include the uv  optical emission of the accretion disk ( dermer & schlickeiser 1993 ) and the ir thermal emission from the dusty torus ( baejowski et al . 2000 ) .",
    "all these components are present at some level at all distances from the central black hole , but the relative importance changes with distance ( e.g. , dermer et al .",
    "2009 , sikora et al .",
    "2009 , ghisellini & tavecchio 2009 ) .",
    "in particular , photons from the blr should be dominant at distances of @xmath14@xmath15 schwarzschild radii ( @xmath16 cm for typical bh masses around @xmath17 m@xmath18 ) commonly inferred from the variability timescale of these sources ( e.g. tavecchio et al .",

    "( 2008 ) , marscher et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2010 ) , abdo et al .",
    "if the jet main emission region is located within the blr , the emission line photons , besides acting as seeds for the ic process , are also a source of _ opacity _ for the outgoing @xmath1ray emission at energies above 1 gev through the reaction : @xmath19 ( e.g. donea & protheroe 2003 , liu & bai 2006 , tavecchio & mazin 2009 , hereafter tm09 , poutanen & stern 2010 , hereafter ps10 ) . assuming typical fsrq parameters , the estimated optical depth @xmath20 above few tens of gev would exceeds @xmath21 , making the detection of very high energy photons ( vhe ; @xmath22 gev ) rather problematic in these sources .",
    "the great majority of fsrqs , indeed , display rather steep gev spectra , and opacity effects seem to explain quite well the  universal \" break observed at few gev in the lat spectra of fsrqs ( ps10 , stern & poutanen 2011 ) .",

    "2008 , wagner et al .",
    "2010 , aleksic et al .",
    "2011a ) implies a minimal degree of absorption , leading to propose that , at least during these events , the emission occurs _ beyond _ the blr ( aleksic et al . 2011a , b , tanaka et al .",

    "previous works generally assumed a spherical geometry for the blr .",
    "this paper aims at extending the study of the absorption of @xmath1 rays in the blr , already started in tm09 , exploring in particular the consequences of a  flat \" geometry for the blr . in this case one might expect a substantial reduction of the opacity to he and vhe photons",
    "this guess is based on the fact that the most effective collisions are those head  on , disfavored in a flat geometry . to this aim",
    "we calculate the expected blr spectrum using the photoionizing code cloudy ( ferland et al .",
    "1998 ) with the assumption already used in tavecchio & ghisellini ( 2008 ) and tm09 , extending the calculation of @xmath20 to a flat geometry (  2 ) .",
    "then we discuss the results , showing the optical depth for different combinations of the parameters specifying the system (  3 ) .",

    "0.5 cm      we refer to tavecchio & ghisellini ( 2008 ) and tm09 for a deeper discussion of the model and of the assumptions used in the calculations .",
    "the assumed geometry is sketched in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] . although there are indications pointing to a complex , stratified structure ( e.g. , denney et al .",
    "2009 ) , for simplicity we model the blr as a thin spherical shell with inner radius @xmath23 filled with clouds characterized by density @xmath24 @xmath10 and column @xmath25 @xmath26 . to mimic ",

    "[ sketch ] ) .    -0.3",
    "cm    based on the typical line / continuum luminosity ratio we always assume that blr clouds intercept a fraction @xmath27 of the illuminating continuum ( we consider only the emisphere toward the observer , since the other one is occulted by the disk ) . in the case of a",
    " flat geometry \" this requirement implies a _ lower _ limit to the blr angle , @xmath28 .",
    "the existence of this limit can be simply understood considering that , in order to keep @xmath29 constant for decreasing @xmath3 , the clouds are forced to occupy a decreasing volume , until they will completely fill all the available space . in that case",
    "the solid angle of the geometrical structure containing the clouds satisfies @xmath30 , that is : @xmath31 which , for @xmath32 , gives @xmath33 . for simplicity , in this calculation ( and in the entire paper )",
    "an _ isotropic _ photo  ionizing radiation field is assumed . for a geometrically thin accretion disk ,",
    "for which the flux depends on the cosine of the angle from the jet axis ( e.g. , frank , king & raine 2002 ) , one would obtain a larger value of @xmath28 , due to the depression of the disk flux at large angles .",
    "given this limit , in the following example we assume @xmath34 .",
    "the central illuminating continuum is modelled as a combination of an uv bump and a flat x  ray power law ( see korista & goad 2001 and tavecchio & ghisellini 2008 ) and total luminosity @xmath35 .",
    "we assume a disk temperature @xmath36 k.    the main features of the spectrum produced by blr clouds depend on the value of the ionization parameter , @xmath37 .",
    "we define @xmath38 , using the bolometric luminosity of the ionizing continuum .",
    "[ lines ] shows three examples of spectra in the optical  uv region [ represented as @xmath39 , the relevant quantity for absorption , where @xmath40 is the specific photon energy density ] for three different values of @xmath41 and @xmath15 .",
    "while some of the features change with @xmath37 , the most prominent lines , such as the hydrogen ( @xmath42 hz ) and the helium ii ( @xmath43 hz ) ly@xmath3 lines , are rather stable ( see also ps10 ) .    to reduce the number of free parameters , for a given disk luminosity @xmath35 we have fixed the blr radius according to the relation @xmath44 ( e.g. , ghisellini & tavecchio 2009 ) which is a good approximation of the results of the reverberation mapping technique .",
    "therefore , since @xmath45 , @xmath46 increases with the disk luminosity while the ionization parameter @xmath47 is constant ( corresponding to the spectrum shown in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ lines ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the  shape \" of the optical depth as a function of the photon energy is fixed , and only its normalization changes with the disk luminosity .",
    "ray photons are produced in a region ( assumed stationary ) located at an eighth @xmath4 over the central bh and propagate within the radiation field of the blr .",
    "the optical depth for the @xmath19 process , @xmath48 , is calculated as ( e.g. , liu & bai 2006 ) : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the energy of the @xmath1rays , @xmath51 is the distance of the photons from the bh , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the collision angle , @xmath54 is the angle  dependent number density of the blr photons at each location of the photon path , @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the pair production cross section ( e.g. , heitler 1960 ) and @xmath57 is the solid angle covered by each portion of the blr at a given position @xmath51 . for simplicity of calculation , the upper limit of the integral over @xmath51 has been set to @xmath58 .",
    "-0.8 cm -0.5 cm    thanks to the existence of a sharp kinematic threshold for the process and of a well defined maximum of the cross section , for a given frequency of the target photons it is possible to associate the energy of the @xmath1 rays most effectively interacting and absorbed ( and _ viceversa _ ) . from the threshold definition",
    "we have : @xmath59 considering head  on ( @xmath60 ) collisions one obtains the threshold @xmath61 hz .",
    "the top @xmath51axis of fig .",
    "[ lines ] reports the energy @xmath50 calculated with this relation . given this strict link between @xmath62 and @xmath50 , the optical depth @xmath2 reflects the spectrum of the soft photon field @xmath40 ( smeared by the cross section ) . in particular ( as pointed out by ps10 ) , the h and heii ly@xmath3 line will imprint particular features in the spectrum at typical rest frame energies of @xmath63 gev and 6 gev .    due to the kinematics of the process , the most effective collisions are those head  on .",
    "therefore a  closed \" ( i.e. , @xmath64 ) blr will be more opaque than an  open \" one for which head  on collisions are suppressed . moreover ,",
    "since the threshold for absorption is angle dependent , also the characteristic relation between the @xmath1ray energy and the corresponding frequency of the target will change ( note the angular term in eq .",
    "[ thre ] ) .",
    "this effect implies a change of the threshold energy when changing @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "in our scheme , the optical depth @xmath2 depends on the disk luminosity @xmath35 and on two geometrical parameters : the blr angle @xmath3 and the eighth of the injection region , @xmath4 .    concerning the luminosity , in the following examples we focus on two values , @xmath65 erg s@xmath8 and @xmath66 erg s@xmath8 .",
    "these particular values bracket the distribution of disk luminosities of @xmath1ray emitting fsrq ( e.g. , ghisellini et al .",
    "moreover , they characterize some  prototypical \" fsrqs : the higher luminosity is appropriate for the accretion disk in 3c454.3 ( e.g. , bonnoli et al .",
    "2011 ) , while the lower value is close to the luminosity of the disk in 3c279 ( pian et al .",

    "[ rblr ] , are @xmath67 cm and @xmath68 cm .    having fixed the luminosities , the model is now only specified by the geometrical parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "[ tau ] ( upper panels ) shows the optical depth as a function of energy , @xmath2 , calculated with our model for different values of the blr angle @xmath3 and initial distance @xmath69 and for the two different values of @xmath35 .",

    "[ taudist ] show @xmath20 as a function of @xmath69 and @xmath3 for different values of the photon energy .",
    "all the curves in fig .",
    "[ tau ] have the same structure , strictly linked to the features of blr spectrum . in all cases the optical depth monotonically increases with energy and two well defined  jumps \" are visible , where the optical depth suddenly increases .",
    "these two steps mark the threshold energy for collisions with target photons belonging to the heii and h ly@xmath3 lines ( see the discussion in ps10 ) . for a closed geometry ( solid lines )",
    "the critical energies reflect the threshold energies for the most effective head  on ( @xmath70 ) collisions , @xmath71 gev and @xmath72 gev using eq .",
    "[ thre ] ( more discussion in  3.1 ) .",
    "-0.7 cm -0.5 cm    as already noted , the value of the energy threshold is angle dependent",
    ". therefore the position of the jumps in @xmath2 depend on the blr geometry and position of the emission region .",
    "in particular , for opened geometries , the corresponding curves preserve their shape but they are approximately shifted toward higher energies and the overall level decreases .",
    "both effects are easy to understand : the general decrease of @xmath20 is in fact expected because of the reduced efficiency ( the typical interaction angle progressively decreases ) , while the shift in energy is due to the @xmath73 dependence in the threshold ( eq . [ thre ] ) : target photons of a given energy interact with @xmath1 rays with increased energy .",
    "this effects are clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ tau ] where , together with the case of the  closed \" geometry , we also report the results for @xmath74 and 30@xmath75 .    the same kinematic and angular effects also regulate the behavior of the curves in fig",
    ". [ taualpha ] and [ taudist ] .",
    "in particular , the behavior of the curves in fig . [ taudist ] , showing the dependence of the opacity on the injection heigth , deserve some comments . in the case of the  closed \" geometry ( @xmath76 , solid curves )",
    ", the optical depth gradually decreases for increasing values of @xmath4 as long as @xmath77 since @xmath1ray photons travel for progressively smaller distances within the blr .",
    "when the injection heigth coincides with the blr radius , the optical depth shows a rapid decrease , caused by the abrupt transition from a situation in which @xmath20 is dominated by head  on ( @xmath78 ) collision to that in which only unfavorable collision angles ( @xmath79 ) are allowed .",
    "the same behaviour is followed by the curves corresponding to different @xmath3 ( dotted lines : 60@xmath75 ; dashed : 30@xmath75 ) although the decrease of @xmath20 at @xmath80 is smoother due to the intrinsic absence of the critical head  on collisions .",
    "all the features discussed above for the optical depth @xmath2 are reflected by the out  going _ absorbed _ @xmath1ray spectrum of fsrq .",
    "in particular , as pointed out in ps10 , for power law intrinsic spectra @xmath81 , the  jumps \" in the optical depth imprint in the absorbed spectrum ( lower panels in fig .",
    "[ tau ] ) , spectral _ breaks _ where the observed spectrum displays a sudden change of slope , i.e. @xmath82 above the break energy @xmath83 corresponding to the energy threshold for a given emission line .",
    "the breaks are clearly visible in the cases in which the optical depth approaches unity , @xmath84 . for a closed geometry ,",
    "these breaks are located always at the same energy and ps10 argued that this effect associated to the heii line could account for the  universal \" energy break observed at few gev in the lat spectra of fsrqs .",
    "the variations of the energy of the jumps in @xmath20 caused by changes in @xmath3 and @xmath4 translate in the change of the break energies in the observed spectrum . furthermore , since the change of the slope at the break is proportional to the optical depth around @xmath85 , @xmath86 ( ps10 ) , not only the energy of the break , but also @xmath87 will depend on @xmath88 and @xmath4 .",
    "both effects are clearly visible in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ deltagamma][break ] separately show the dependence of @xmath87 and @xmath85 on the geometrical parameters .",
    "we limit the results to the case of the heii break whose energy is the most accessible with _ fermi_/lat data .",
    "as expected , @xmath87 , directly proportional to the optical depth , decreases with decreasing @xmath3 and increasing @xmath4 . on the other hand , the dependence of @xmath85 on @xmath4 , due to the angular dependence of the threshold energy in eq .",
    "[ thre ] , is more complex . for @xmath76 the opacity",
    "is mostly determined by head  on collision as long as @xmath89 and thus heii line photons will produce the break at @xmath90 . for emission sites beyond the blr , instead",
    ", soft photons are coming at angles @xmath91 and thus , according to the angular dependence in eq .",
    "[ thre ] , the break will move to higher energies .    for opened geometries , instead ( with no head  on collisions ) ,",
    "the increase of @xmath4 determines a decrease of the typical collision angle between @xmath1 rays and blr photons which , due to the angular dependence of the threshold energy , translates in the monotonic increase of @xmath85 with @xmath4 .",
    "both dependences reflect that of @xmath20 in figs .",
    "[ taualpha ] and [ taudist ] .",
    "evidence for variations of the optical depth @xmath92 ( and correspondingly of @xmath87 ) has been found by stern & poutanen ( 2011 ) analyzing the _ fermi_/lat spectra of the bright fsrq 3c454.3 at different epochs .",
    "they interpret these variations as due to different location of the emitting region in a _ stratified _",
    "blr , in which ( high  ionization ) heii lines are produced at radii smaller than low ",
    "ionization lines .",
    "emission episodes occurring well within the blr , close to the  heii blr \" would result in strong absorption and large @xmath87 .",
    "if @xmath1rays are instead produced at larger radii , the absorption through heii photons is suppressed and , correspondingly , the break around the heii threshold energy is less pronounced .    the flat blr scenario allows a different , although related , interpretation .",
    "also in this case , in fact , the opacity depends on the distance of the emission region from the central black hole .",
    "this leads to envisage scenarios in which , analogously to the model of stern & poutanen ( 2011 ) , the location of the emission region in the jet changes with time , causing the opacity to @xmath1rays to change . in this case , however , the variations are fundamentally linked to the angular dependence of kinematics and energy threshold of the absorption process .",
    "if the blr is  closed \" the break energy do not change as long as the emission occurs within the blr but @xmath87 decreases for increasing @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ deltagammaro ] ) .",
    "instead , for  opened \" geometries , both @xmath87 and @xmath85 depend on @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ deltagammaro ] and [ break ] ) . in this case , see fig .",
    "[ dgvseb ] , a well defined connection between @xmath87 and @xmath93 is expected .    the dependence of @xmath87 and @xmath85 with geometry , summarized in figs .",
    "[ deltagammaro][break ] , allows us to envisage several interesting cases .",
    "for instance , a break at @xmath94 surely points to an open geometry .",
    "if , in addition , @xmath85 and @xmath87 do not change from state to state , we can conclude that the emitting source is approximately located at a fixed distance from the black hole ( as expected in the case of a standing shock ) .",
    "alternatively , a correlated variation of @xmath85 and @xmath87 would allows us , in principle , to determine @xmath3 .",
    "these examples show that the flattened blr scenario is clearly testable and predictive , allowing , for instance , to determine @xmath3 if correlated variations of @xmath87 and @xmath85 are observed .      as discussed in the introduction , one issue that motivated our study",
    "was to explore the possibility to avoid important absorption at high energy ( @xmath95 gev ) .",
    "indeed , as already extensively discussed in literature ( e.g. liu & bai 2006 , sitarek & bednarek 2008 , tm09 , ps10 ) , under standard assumptions the blr is expected to be strongly opaque above few tens of gev .",
    "this fact forces to conclude that the vhe emission detected from fsrqs is produced outside the blr ( e.g. , tanaka et al . 2011 , aleksic et al . 2011a ,",
    "b , tavecchio et al . 2011 , dermer et al .",
    "2012 ) , even if the short variability timescale points to rather compact regions ( for a non  standard view considering photon  axion conversions , see tavecchio et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "-0.8 cm    -0.6 cm    fig .",
    "[ tau ] shows that for @xmath76 (  closed \" blr ) the optical depth exceeds 10 above 30 gev for both low and high luminosity if the emission region is located well inside the blr . for high luminosities",
    "the same is true even considering the case of open blr with @xmath3 as small as 30@xmath75 ( left panel ) . at low luminosities , because of the @xmath96 dependence , the optical depth is generally smaller than in the high luminosity case but it is still much larger than 1 for a standard blr and a jet emission region located inside the blr . only for flat geometries and large distances @xmath97 ) , @xmath20 decreases below a few .",

    "-0.4 cm    -0.4 cm    concluding , we showed that for all the possible geometries and luminosities it is very hard to avoid very large absorption even in the case of flattened geometries .",
    "thus fsrq are expected to be strongly opaque at high energy photons , @xmath95 gev if the emission occurs well within the blr .",
    "therefore , as in tavecchio et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , for the case of the vhe flare of pks 1222 + 200 ( and also for 3c279 , aleksic et al .",
    "2011b ) , one is forced to assume that the emitting region is located at large distances ( @xmath100 ) even in the case of extreme flat geometries .",
    "we have studied the absorption of @xmath1 rays through the interaction with the uv ",
    "optical photons emitted by the blr in fsrq assuming a  flattened \" geometry .",
    "we showed that the geometry has an important impact in the resulting opacity to @xmath1 rays , that can be traced back to the angular dependence of the kinematics and the pair production energy threshold .",
    "in particular we have discussed the implication of the blr geometry for the  gev break \" imprinted in the @xmath1ray spectra at energies corresponding to the most prominent emission lines . while in the case of a completely spherical blr the energy of these spectral features is fixed",
    ", corresponding to the threshold energy associated to lines photons interacting head  on with @xmath1 rays , an opened geometry implies a dependence of @xmath85 on the location of the jet emission site .",
    "together with the parallel dependence of @xmath87 , the change of spectral index at the break , this dependence could in principle be used to reconstruct the blr geometry and the location of the emission region .",
    "of course several aspects of our treatment are highly idealized . the possible stratification of the blr , with different emission lines produced at different distances from the photo  ionizing source has been neglected ( e.g. , krolik 1999 , stern & poutanen 2011 ) .",
    "we also do not consider the possibility that electrons associated to a tenuous warm gas filling the inner agn regions can partly scatter and isotropize the blr and accretion disc photons , making the angular dependence at the base of the effects less sharp .",
    "finally , we do not include in the calculation the ir radiation field emitted by the hot ( @xmath101 k ) dusty torus , which is expected to be an important source of opacity above few hundreds of gev ( e.g. , donea & protheroe 2003 ) .",
    "finally , we mention that another issue worth to be explored is the impact of the blr geometry on the high  energy emission produced through the inverse compton scattering of the blr photons , envisaged in the external compton models ( e.g. , tavecchio & ghisellini 2008 ) .",
    "we can expect that an opened geometry could lead to changes in , e.g. , typical frequencies and luminosities of this component , thought to dominate the @xmath1ray emission of fsrqs . these changes , in turn , would translate in different inferred parameters for the emissione zone .    besides these issues , that can be explored in a future work , the clear  cut results that we derived make the scheme attractively predictive and testable , and",
