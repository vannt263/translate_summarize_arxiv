    "currently there is great interest in the very high - energy gamma - ray signal from the center of the galaxy , where recently the cangaroo @xcite , veritas @xcite and h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite collaborations have reported results .",
    "the three experiments find different spectra , something that may depend on different angular acceptances , energy calibrations , etc .",
    "the h.e.s.s .",
    "result superficially looks more detailed and accurate and is therefore the one we will focus on here , although of course the three groups will have to find a conclusive reason for the reported discrepancies . there have already been speculations of a tev - scale dark matter ( dm ) particle giving , through annihilations , a steady source of these photons @xcite . of course , there are other possibilities for emission of these gamma rays related to the physics around the galactic massive black hole @xcite .",
    "the prototype dm particle is the neutralino , the lightest supersymmetric particle .",
    "the phenomenology of this candidate has been worked out in detail over the last two decades ( for a summary , see @xcite ) . however",
    ", these models give a rather soft gamma - ray spectrum , so one has to push masses up to the tens of tev range to match the results of h.e.s.s . , which will be our main concern in this letter .",
    "we focus instead on an interesting alternative which has received much attention in recent years ; that of universal extra dimensions ( ued ) @xcite . in these models ,",
    "all standard model fields propagate in the higher dimensional bulk . for the effective four - dimensional theory ,",
    "this means that all particles are accompanied by a tower of increasingly more massive kaluza - klein ( kk ) states .",
    "momentum conservation in the extra dimensions , which corresponds to kk mode number conservation , is broken by an orbifold compactification which projects out unwanted degrees of freedom at the zero mode level .",
    "if the boundary terms introduced at the orbifold fixed points are identical , then a remnant of kk mode number conservation is left in the form of kk parity , and the lightest kk particle ( lkp ) is stable @xcite .",
    "this is analogous to conserved r - parity in supersymmetric models which ensures the stability of the lightest supersymmetric particle .",
    "if the lkp is also neutral and non - baryonic , it is a potential dark matter candidate .",
    "we consider the simplest , five - dimensional model with one compactified ued on an @xmath1 orbifold of radius @xmath2 . at tree level ,",
    "the @xmath3th kk mode mass is then given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the zero mode mass .",
    "however , the identification of the lkp is nontrivial because radiative corrections to the mass spectrum of the first kk level are typically larger than the corresponding electroweak mass shifts given by @xmath5 .",
    "a one - loop calculation @xcite shows that the lkp is well approximated by the first kk mode of the hypercharge gauge boson @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath6 relic density was determined in @xcite .",
    "depending on the exact form of the mass spectrum and the resulting coannihilation channels , the limit from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite of @xmath7 corresponds to @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 is the ratio of dm to critical density and @xmath10 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath11 .",
    "collider measurements of electroweak observables give a current constraint of @xmath12 @xcite , whereas lhc should probe compactification radii up to 1.5 tev @xcite .",
    "the prospects of kk dm detection have been studied in some detail @xcite .",
    "secondary gamma rays from cascading quark decays due to @xmath13 annihilation in the gc produce relatively soft spectra @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the supersymmetric case , charged lepton production is not helicity suppressed , which , e.g. , results in a striking peak signal in the positron spectrum @xcite for masses @xmath14 0.5 tev . this has led us to also study the decays of @xmath0 leptons and the spectrum of _ primary _ continuum gamma rays from the production and subsequent radiative photon emission of high - energy charged leptons .",
    "we first consider primary gamma rays . at tree level , with all other first level kk modes degenerate in mass , @xmath6 pairs annihilate into quark pairs ( 35% ) , charged lepton pairs ( 59% ) , neutrinos ( 4% ) , charged ( 1% ) and neutral ( 0.5% ) gauge bosons , and higgs bosons ( 0.5% ) .",
    "these branching ratios agree with those obtained by servant and tait @xcite ( however , they do not take into account electroweak symmetry breaking ) . in this letter",
    "we only consider photons radiated from charged leptons @xmath15 .",
    "we do not concern ourselves with the radiative processes which electrons and positrons encounter during their propagation through the galaxy , as these give mostly low - energy photons .",
    "the exception may be inverse compton scattering on infrared photons and starlight , but generally this is expected to be only a small correction @xcite .",
    "[ ] [ ] [ 1 ] [ ] [ ] [ 1 ] [ r][r][1 ] [ ] [ ] [ 1 ] [ ] [ ] [ 1 ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    the tree level feynman diagrams which contribute to the process @xmath16 are shown in fig .",
    "the computation of the cross section is straightforward and we find that the differential photon multiplicity is well approximated by @xmath17},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 . from the electromagnetic coupling and the phase space difference between two- and three - body final states , one would expect an answer of the order of @xmath19 times a large logarithm , which is related to a collinear divergence .",
    "our calculation shows that there is indeed such a leading logarithmic term , giving large contributions for high photon energies @xmath20 .",
    "restricting ourselves to these energies ( at lower energy , quark fragmentation dominates anyway ) , the radiative correction , although large , is not more than some five percent of the lowest order cross section .",
    "therefore , there is no need in this first treatment of the problem to sum leading logarithms , but this could eventually be done @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize that our result ( [ sigma ] ) is almost entirely due to the very large mass of the @xmath6 and practically independent of the initial state spin .",
    "expressed in the scaling variable @xmath21 , it is furthermore quite insensitive to the @xmath6 mass and the mass splitting at the first kk level .",
    "this result therefore applies not only to kk dm , but to any weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) candidate with nonsuppressed couplings to charged leptons .",
    "let us now consider secondary gamma rays .",
    "as already mentioned , cascading decays of @xmath22 final states have been studied previously @xcite . here",
    ", we also include the semihadronic decays of @xmath0 leptons , which are important in kk dm models since they have a fairly hard spectrum and a branching ratio of around 20% .",
    "we will use the recent results of fornengo , pieri , and scopel @xcite , who have used the pythia monte carlo code @xcite to parametrize @xmath23 for quarks and @xmath0 leptons with a center of mass energy of 1 tev .",
    "we neglect the few percent going into @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and higgs final states .    [ ] [ ] [ 1.0]@xmath26 [ ] [ ] [ 0.95]@xmath27 [ ] [ ] [ 0.8 ] [ ] [ ] [ 0.8 ] [ ] [ ] [ 0.8 ] [ ] [ ] [ 0.8 ]   annihilation ( solid line ) , multiplied by @xmath28 .",
    "also shown is what quark fragmentation alone would give ( dashed line ) , and adding to that the contribution from @xmath0 leptons ( dotted line ) .",
    "here we have assumed a @xmath6 mass of 0.8 tev and a 5% mass splitting at the first kk level , but the result is quite insensitive to these parameters.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the total number of photons per @xmath13 annihilation is given by @xmath29 , where the sum is over all processes that contribute to primary or secondary gamma rays , and @xmath30 are the corresponding branching ratios . the result is shown in fig .  [ spectrum ] .",
    "previous analyses of the photon flux correspond to the much softer and sharply falling spectrum from quark fragmentation alone . also shown",
    "is the more important contribution from @xmath0 decays , and of course the radiative direct process which is the main topic of this letter .",
    "the details of the galactic halo profile are to a large extent unknown . high resolution n - body simulations favor cuspy halos , with radial density distributions ranging from @xmath31 @xcite to @xmath32 @xcite in the inner regions .",
    "it has further been suggested that adiabatic accretion of dm onto the massive black hole in the center of the milky way may produce a dense spike of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "this has , however , been contested @xcite . on the other hand , adiabatic contraction from the dense stellar cluster , which is measured to exist near",
    "the gc , is likely to compress the halo dm substantially @xcite .",
    "this means that there is support for a rather dense halo profile very near the center - something that may be tested with the new 30-m - class telescopes @xcite .",
    "bearing these uncertainties in mind , we will use the moderately cuspy ( @xmath31 ) profile by navarro , frenk and white ( nfw ) @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , the differential gamma - ray flux from wimp annihilation in the gc can be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the total @xmath6 annihilation rate , and @xmath36 is a dimensionless line - of - sight integral averaged over @xmath37 , the angular acceptance of the detector . for a nfw profile ,",
    "one expects @xmath38 for @xmath39 @xcite , which is appropriate for the h.e.s.s . telescope . here , we allow for an explicit boost factor @xmath40 that parametrizes deviations from a pure nfw profile ( @xmath41 ) and may be as high as 1000 when taking into account the expected effects of adiabatic compression @xcite . for kk dm , @xmath42 @xcite .",

    "the solid line corresponds to a hypothetical 10 tev wimp with similar couplings , a total annihilation rate given by the wmap relic density bound , and a boost factor around 1000.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in fig .",
    "[ hess ] , we plot the total differential gamma - ray flux for a @xmath6 mass of 0.8 tev together with the recent h.e.s.s . observations with its surprising , relatively hard spectrum @xcite .",
    "as can be seen , an excellent fit to the data is obtained for energies up to @xmath49 , requiring only a moderate value for the boost factor @xmath40 of roughly 100 .",
    "a more detailed analysis would of course take the energy resolution of the detector into account , giving a less rapid cutoff at the @xmath6 mass .    in order to explain the whole observed spectrum with kk dm , one would thus need a mass of .",
    "such a high mass , however , is outside the range selected by the relic density constraint and thus disfavored .",
    "it has to be kept in mind , though , that models with extra dimensions may have quite a different behavior near freeze - out than ordinary models , which could alter the conclusions about the preferred mass range .",
    "abnormally large running of the @xmath50 coupling might also allow for larger masses @xcite .",
    "as remarked before , we expect a similar spectrum for any wimp dark matter candidate with nonsuppressed couplings to charged leptons",
    ". such a model would give a nice fit to the full h.e.s.s .",
    "data , if the canonical wimp relation given by the wmap relic density bound , @xmath51 @xcite , allows for particle masses above 7 tev . for the kk dm scenario considered here",
    ", this would require the @xmath6 s gauge coupling to be increased by a factor of roughly three .",
    "as an illustration , we have included such a hypothetical particle of mass 10 tev in fig .",
    "[ hess ] with a boost factor of roughly 1000 .",
    "models which only get a contribution from quark fragmentation , on the other hand , need a much larger boost factor to fit the observed range . for supersymmetry @xcite ,",
    "for example , one is furthermore pushed to a neutralino mass larger than about 12 tev , which starts to involve severe fine - tuning of parameters .",
    "it has to be remembered , though , that the radiative effects investigated in this letter have not yet been systematically studied for supersymmetric models @xcite .",
    "of course , the models presented in fig .  [ hess ] must not violate the constraints given by the existing egret @xcite measurements in the energy range 30 mev - 10 gev .",
    "we find , however , that these upper bounds are easily satisfied .",
    "there are some further tests which should be performed in the future to check the kk hypothesis of the tev gamma - ray signal . of course",
    ", a signal from annihilating dm is not expected to show any detectable time dependence . since the mass of the dm particle is an abolute cutoff for the energy of any secondary particle , a steplike drop",
    "should definitely be searched for .",
    "if one gets instruments with better energy resolution , the line from @xmath52 annihilation @xcite may form the final proof of the particle dm hypothesis @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to follow the wealth of new results expected from h.e.s.s . , as well as magic @xcite , cangaroo @xcite and veritas @xcite .",
    "the glast satellite @xcite should also give important data in the range where the various final states cooperate to give a signal .",
    "the fate of the produced electrons and positrons should also be investigated , something that will need educated guesses for the magnetic field and exact dm density distribution near the gc .",
    "in fact , a slightly boosted nfw profile seems to predict a radio signal which is quite close to that observed @xcite .",
    "we find further that the direct annihilation into neutrinos will , in the kk model and with the same halo parameters explaining the gamma - ray signal , give an event rate corresponding to a few events per km@xmath53 per year @xcite , something that could eventually be detected in a neutrino telescope with good view of the gc .",
    "in this letter we have presented the somewhat surprising result that gamma rays radiated from charged leptons in @xmath13 annihilations ( e.g. , near the gc , but also in other overdense regions of the halo , and maybe even in the diffuse extragalactic gamma - ray spectrum @xcite ) could be the most promising way to detect the effects of kk dm and to possibly differentiate it from other candidates .",
    "we have seen that the signature is a surprisingly hard spectrum , at high energies several orders of magnitude larger than the previously studied case of quark fragmentation alone , which extends all the way to the mass of the dm particle and then drops rapidly . even if the present gamma - ray signal detected by h.e.s.s .",
    "will turn out to have another cause , the sharp drop at @xmath54 is a nice signature for that and other experiments to look for .",
