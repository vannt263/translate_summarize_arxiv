    "strange stars are astronomical compact objects which are entirely made of deconfined quarks ( for a review , see glendenning 1996 ; weber 1999 ) .",
    "the possible existence of strange stars is a direct consequence of the conjecture that strange quark matter ( sqm ) may be the absolute ground state of the strong interaction , i.e. , absolutely stable with respect to @xmath1fe ( bodmer 1971 ; witten 1984 ) .",
    "sqm with a density of @xmath2 g  @xmath3 might exist up to the surface of a strange star .",
    "recently , the thermal emission from bare sqm surfaces of strange stars was considered ( usov 1998 , 2001a ) .",
    "it was shown that the surface emissivity of sqm in both equilibrium photons and @xmath0 pairs created by the coulomb barrier at the sqm surface is @xmath4% of the black body surface emissivity at the surface temperature @xmath5  k. below this temperature , @xmath6  k , the sqm surface emissivity decreases rapidly with decrease of @xmath7 .    at the moment of formation of a strange star",
    "the surface temperature may be as high as @xmath8  k ( e.g. , haensel , paczyski , & amsterdamski 1991 ) . since sqm at the surface of a bare strange star",
    "is bound via strong interaction rather than gravity , such a star can radiate at the luminosity greatly exceeding the eddington limit , up to @xmath9  ergs  s@xmath10 at @xmath11  k. ( alcock , farhi , & olinto 1986 ; chmaj , haensel , & slomiski 1991 ; usov 1998 , 2001a ) .",
    "a young strange star cools rapidly , and within about a month after its formation the surface temperature is less than @xmath12  k ( e.g. , pizzochero 1991 ) . in this case , the thermal luminosity from the stellar surface in both equilibrium photons and @xmath0 pairs is negligibly small , @xmath13  ergs  s@xmath10 .",
    "a bare strange star with such a low surface temperature may be a strong source of radiation only if its surface is reheated .",
    "recently , response of a bare strange star to accretion of a massive comet - like object with the mass @xmath14  g onto the stellar surface was considered ( usov 2001b ) .",
    "it was shown that the light curves of the two giant bursts observed from the soft @xmath15-ray repeaters sgr 0526 - 66 and sgr 1900 + 14 may be easily explained in this model .    in this paper",
    "we report on our numerical simulations of the response of a bare strange star to energy input onto its surface .",
    "we consider a wide range of the rate of the energy input .",
    "both normal and colour superconducting sqm are discussed .",
    "the model to be studied is the following .",
    "the energy input onto the surface of a bare strange star starts at the moment @xmath16 , and it is spherical and steady at @xmath17 .",
    "since in our simulations the surface temperature is not higher than @xmath18  k , @xmath0 pairs created by the coulomb barrier are the main component of the thermal emission from the stellar surface ( usov 2001a ) .",
    "we assume that the process of the energy input has no effect on the outflow of both created pairs and photons which form due to annihilation of some of these pairs ( cf .",
    "usov 2001b ) .",
    "the equation of heat transfer that describes the temperature distribution at the surface layers of a strange star is    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the specific heat for sqm per unit volume , @xmath21 is the thermal conductivity , and @xmath22 is the neutrino emissivity .    the heat flux due to thermal conductivity is    @xmath23    at the stellar surface , @xmath24 , the heat flux directed into the strange star is equal to ( usov 2001b )    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the rate of the energy input onto the stellar surface , @xmath27  cm is the radius of the star , @xmath28 is the energy flux in @xmath0 pairs emitted from the sqm surface , @xmath29 is the mean energy of created pairs ,    @xmath30    is the flux of pairs from the unit sqm surface ,    @xmath31    @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the surface temperature in units of @xmath34  k.    eqs . @xmath35 give a boundary condition on @xmath36 at the stellar surface .",
    "we assume that at the initial moment , @xmath16 , the temperature in the surface layers is constant , @xmath37  k.    it has been suggested ( bailin & love 1979 , 1984 ) that the quarks may eventually form cooper pairs .",
    "recently , superconductivity of sqm was considered in detail ( for a review , see rajagopal , & wilczek 2000 ; alford , bowers , & rajagopal 2001 ) , and it was shown that sqm is plausibly a colour superconductor if its temperature not too high .",
    "below , we consider both normal and superconducting sqm .      for non - superconducting sqm , the contribution of the quarks to both the specific heat and the thermal conductivity prevails over the contributions of the electrons , photons and gluons .",
    "in this case we have ( iwamoto 1982 ; heiselberg & pethick 1993 ; benvenuto & althaus 1996 )    @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40    where @xmath41  @xmath3 is normal nuclear matter density , @xmath42 is the baryon number density of sqm , @xmath43 is the qcd fine structure constant , @xmath44 is the quark - gluon coupling constant , @xmath45 is the number of electrons per baryon , and @xmath46 is the temperature in units of @xmath34  k.      sqm may be a colour superconductor if its temperature is below some critical value . in the classic model of bardeen ,",
    "cooper , and schrieffer the critical temperature is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the energy gap at zero temperature and @xmath49 is the boltzmann constant ( e.g. , carter & reddy 2000 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath50 is very uncertain and lies in the range from @xmath51  mev ( bailin & love 1984 ) to @xmath52  mev ( alford , rajagopal , & wilczek 1998 ; alford , berges , & rajagopal 1999 ; pisarski & rischke 2000 ) .",
    "we use the following interpolation formula for the temperature dependence of the energy gap(e.g . , carter & reddy 2000 ) :    @xmath53^{1/2}.\\ ] ]",
    "superconductivity modifies the properties of sqm significantly .",
    "the specific heat of superconducting sqm increases discontinuously as the temperature falls below the critical temperature , and then decreases exponentially at lower temperatures . for the quark specific heat at @xmath54",
    "we adopt the theoretical results of m \" uhlschlegel ( 1959 ) for superconducting nucleons , i.e. , ( horvath , benvenuto , & vucetich 1991 ; blaschke , kl \" ahn , & voskresensky 2000 )    @xmath55    @xmath56\\,,\\ ] ]    here and below tilde signifies that this value relates to superconducting sqm .",
    "even at @xmath57 the suppression of the specific heat of sqm is never complete because the electrons remain unpaired .",
    "the specific heat of superconducting sqm which is used in our simulations is @xmath58 , where    @xmath59    is the specific heat of the electron subsystem of sqm ( blaschke , grigorian , & voskresensky 2001 ) .    at @xmath60 both the thermal conductivity of sqm and its neutrino emissivity",
    "are suppressed by a factor of @xmath61 ) . in our simulations",
    ", we adopt    @xmath62+k_e\\,,\\ ] ]    @xmath63\\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath64 and @xmath22 are given by equations ( 7 ) and ( 8) , respectively , and    @xmath65    is the thermal conductivity of the electrons ( e.g. , blaschke et  al .",
    "the set of equations @xmath66 was solved numerically for both normal @xmath67 and superconducting @xmath68 states of sqm .",
    "we assumed the typical values of @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "figure  1 shows a typical temporal behaviour of the strange star luminosity , @xmath72 , in @xmath0 pairs . from this figure",
    ", we can see that @xmath73 increases eventually to its maximum value @xmath74 .",
    "the rate of this increase may be characterized by the rise time @xmath75 that is determined as a time interval from the initial moment , @xmath16 , to the moment when @xmath73 is equal to @xmath76 .",
    "the results of our simulations are presented in tables  1 and  2 .",
    "there is a critical value , @xmath77 , of the input luminosity at which the dependence of @xmath74 on @xmath26 changes qualitatively ( see table  1 ) .",
    "@xmath77 is @xmath78  ergs  s@xmath10 for normal sqm and @xmath79  ergs  s@xmath10 for superconducting sqm with @xmath80  mev . at @xmath81",
    ", @xmath74 is about @xmath26 while when @xmath26 is a few times below than @xmath77 the thermal emission of @xmath0 pairs from the stellar surface is negligible .    in our simulations ,",
    "the rise time @xmath75 varies in a very wide range from @xmath82  s at @xmath83  ergs  s@xmath10 and @xmath84  mev to @xmath85  s at @xmath86  ergs  s@xmath10 and @xmath87  mev ( see table  2 ) .    at @xmath87",
    "mev the thermal emission of @xmath0 pairs does not depend on @xmath48 because in this case both the specific heat of the quarks and their thermal conductivity are strongly suppressed , and the heat transport is mostly determined by the electron subsystem of sqm .",
    "the rise time of the luminosity in neutrinos is many orders of magnitude larger that @xmath75 , especially when @xmath75 is small . in our model",
    "the neutrino luminosity may increase up to @xmath88 when @xmath89 goes to infinity .",
    "this is because all energy which is delivered onto the stellar surface is radiated either from the surface by @xmath0 pairs or from the stellar interior by neutrinos .",
    "since bare strange stars can radiate at the luminosities greatly exceeding the eddington limit ( alcock et al .",
    "1986 ; chmaj et al .",
    "1991 ; usov 1998 , 2001a ) , these stars are reasonable candidates for soft @xmath15-ray repeaters ( sgrs ) that are the sources of brief ( @xmath90  s ) bursts with super - eddington luminosities , up to @xmath91 . the bursting activity of a sgr may be explained by fast heating of the bare , rather cold ( @xmath92  k ) surface of a strange star up to the temperature of @xmath93  k and its subsequent thermal emission ( usov 2001a ) .",
    "the heating mechanism may be either fast decay of superstrong ( @xmath94  g ) magnetic fields ( usov 1984 ; duncan & thompson 1992 ; paczy ' nski 1992 ; thompson & duncan 1995 ; cheng & dai 1998 ; heyl & kulkarni 1998 ) or impacts of comet - like objects onto the stellar surface ( harwitt & salpeter 1973 ; newman & cox 1980 ; zhang , xu , & qiao 2000 ; usov 2001b ) .",
    "the magnetar model of sgrs which is based on the first mechanism is most popular now . in this model ,",
    "the magnetic energy of a strongly magnetized strange star ( magnetar ) may be released from time to time due to mhd instabilities . a violent release of energy inside a magnetar excites surface oscillations ( e.g. , thompson & duncan 1995 ) .",
    "in turn , this shaking may generate strong electric fields in the magnetar magnetosphere which accelerate particles to high energies .",
    "these high energy particles bombard the surface of the strange star and heat it . at the input luminosities of @xmath95  ergs  s@xmath10 , which are typical for sgrs ,",
    "the efficiency of reradiation of the partical energy by the stellar surface to @xmath0 pairs is very high , @xmath96 , especially for superconducting sqm ( see table  1 ) . since for sgrs",
    "the burst luminosities are at least a few orders of magnitude higher than @xmath97 , the outflowing @xmath0 pairs mostly annihilate in the vicinity of the strange star ( e.g. , beloborodov 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , at @xmath98  ergs  s@xmath10 far from the star the luminosity in x - ray and @xmath15-ray photons practically coincides with @xmath99 , @xmath100 .    two giant bursts were observed on 5 march 1979 and 27 august 1998 from sgr  @xmath101 and sgr  @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "the peak luminosities of these bursts were @xmath103  ergs  s@xmath10 ( fenimore , klebesadel , & laros 1996 ; hurley et al .",
    "1999 ) . in this case , from table  2 the rise time expected in our model is @xmath104  s that is consistent with available data on the two giant bursts ( mazets et al . 1999 ) .",
    "this is valid irrespective of that sqm is a colour superconductor or not . for typical bursts of sgrs",
    "the luminosities are @xmath105  ergs  s@xmath10 ( e.g. , kouveliotou 1995 ) , and the observed rise times ( @xmath106  s ) may be explained in our model only if sqm is a superconductor with the energy gap @xmath107  mev ( see table  2 ) .",
