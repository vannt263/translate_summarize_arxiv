    "the quest for understanding the fate of antimatter in the universe  and to fully understand cp violation  has triggered a hunt to measure the electric dipole moment  ( edm ) .",
    "so far , all measurements have shown the upper limit of the neutron edm is on the order of @xmath2  e@xmath1 cm .",
    "however , no direct edm measurement of charged light ions including protons , have yet been performed .",

    "[ bmt ] , @xmath10 is the spin vector in the particle s frame , while @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the magnetic field perpendicular and parallel to the particle s velocity , respectively .",
    "since the edm is expected to be significantly smaller than the magnetic dipole moment  ( mdm ) , the spin motion is dominated by the mdm .",
    "the concept of measuring the edm in a storage ring with the mdm part of the spin motion frozen along the velocity of the particle was developed and investigated by the bnl sredm collaboration@xcite .",
    "the proposed storage ring for a deuteron edm search uses static hybrid electro and magnetic deflectors to freeze the mdm part of the spin motion .",
    "the possible sources of systematic errors for such a high precision edm storage ring was evaluated and the residual non - zero average vertical electric field was identified as the only source of first order systematic errors .",
    "other error sources , such as fringe fields as well as the electric and magnetic fields in the rf cavity , introduce higher order systematic errors to the edm measurement .",
    "the spin precession due to the average non - zero vertical electric field @xmath13 is given by@xcite @xmath14    for a partially spin frozen based edm search in a storage ring , such as the proposed direct measurement of the deuteron edm at the cooler synchrotron  ( cosy )  @xcite , the additional vertical polarization buildup from the radial magnetic fields is the dominant source of systematic error .",
    "hence , the closed orbit has to be corrected and controlled to a high precision  @xcite .",
    "this is currently the limiting factor for achieving the proposed measurement sensitivity .",
    "hence , the mdm spin transparent quadrupole proposed below may also be beneficial by mitigating the systematic error from the radial magnetic fields due to the off - center trajectory in the magnetic quadrupole fields .",
    "similar to the condition for freezing spin in a dipole , in order to make the mdm part of the spin motion to be transparent in a quadrupole , both electric and magnetic quadrupole fields are needed . for a linear electric quadrupole , the electric field can be described as @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the radius of the quadrupole , @xmath17 and @xmath18 being the normal and skew component , respectively . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the horizontal and vertical distances from the center of the quadrupole .",

    "as discussed in the original bnl deuteron edm storage ring proposal , where the lattice consists of spin frozen electric and magnetic deflectors , the residual average non - zero vertical electric field @xmath32 is the primary source of first order contribution to the systematic error . in the bnl proposal",

    "@xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the radial magnetic field and vertical electric field a particle sees in a mdmst quadrupole , and the resulting spin precession @xmath41 .",

    "[ eb_omegaev ] @xmath42 for deuterons at momentum of @xmath33  @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath43 , this additional spin precession due to non - zero vertical electric field is about @xmath44 , about an order of magnitude smaller than the case with pure magnetic quadrupoles .",

    "this is a proposed design for an edm search using a pure electric proton storage ring .",
    "the other lattice is based upon the firest lattice but uses deuterons with mdmst quadrupoles and full spin frozen eb deflectors .",

    "[ verticalspinbuildup_cox ] shows a second study where the vertical spin component is plotted as a function of turn number for a particle launched on the closed orbit for both the deuteron and proton lattices . in this case , the quadrupoles in the lattices were misaligned to give a nonzero horizontal closed orbit but with a zero vertical closed orbit .",
    "it is evident that , in the absence of vertical motion the nonzero horizontal orbit has no impact on the vertical spin motion .    a vertical closed orbit distortion , on the other hand , can result in non - zero vertical spin buildup from the particle s magnetic dipole moment .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ eb_verticalspinbuildup_coy ] which shows the vertical spin component buildup of a particle with zero edm in the deuteron storage ring with the quadrupoles vertically misaligned . here ,",
    "the magnetic dipole moment coupled with the vertical closed orbit leads to a buildup of the vertical spin component .",
    "the larger the vertical closed orbit , the faster the vertical spin component buildup gets .",
    "similarly , the vertical spin component in the proton edm storage ring with pure electric elements where the quadrupoles are misaligned also exhibits a linear buildup due to the magnetic dipole moment part of the spin motion , as shown in fig .",
    "[ pedm_verticalspinbuildup_coy ] .",
    "this effect can be explained by the fact that the particle is going off - center of the quadrupole and its velocity is no longer perfectly perpendicular to the field it encounters . assuming that the spin is perfectly frozen at each deflector , the one turn spin transfer map for a storage ring with thin lens quadrupoles is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the spin transfer matrix of the @xmath57 quadrupole and the amount of spin precession @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 with @xmath60 being the length of the quadrupole and @xmath61 is the electric field that the particle encounters at the @xmath57 quadrupole . for the case of a pure electric storage ring , with a non - zero vertical closed orbit , this then becomes @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the total velocity , @xmath64 is the velocity component along the vertical direction and @xmath65 .",
    "the total spin precession @xmath66 after one orbital revolution is given by @xmath67 and is not equal to zero even though @xmath68 for a stable particle on a non - zero closed orbit .",
