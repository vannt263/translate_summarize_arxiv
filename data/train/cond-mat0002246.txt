    "measurements of c - axis tunnelling across adjacent superconducti-+ng bi - layers in highly anisotropic cuprate superconductors , such as 2212-bscco , provide important information about the tunnelling of superconducting pairs and thermally excited quasi - particles . in a field , the decrease in critical current can be related to the misalignment of flux pancakes across adjacent superconducting bi - layers . in this paper , we consider both the quasiparticle conductance and the field dependence of the critical current .",
    "measurements have been made on small mesa structures , typically , shown schematically in the inset of figure 1 , @xmath0 and @xmath110 nm in height corresponding to a linear array of intrinsic josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "measurements have been made on a number of mesas on slightly underdoped @xmath2 , near optimally doped @xmath3 and slightly overdoped @xmath4 2212-bscco crystals , as described along with experimental details in @xcite    in zero - field we observe the familiar multi - branched iv - characteristics first reported and explained by kleiner _",
    "_ et al__@xcite and confirmed by many other groups .",
    "@xcite have already published measurements at relatively large fields@xcite , which we extend to smaller fields .    in our structures ,",
    "the first critical current is smaller than all subsequent transitions , indicating a slight degradation of the uppermost intrinsic junction either below the metal - hts interface or at the milled surface between the current and voltage contacts ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . when considering the temperature and field dependence of @xmath5 we therefore take the largest critical current in the multibranched characteristics as representative of the bulk properties .    measurements inevitably involve a significant amount of self - heating , @xmath6 per intrinsic junction , heating the mesa above the measured base temperature . to circumvent this problem",
    ", we determine the mesa temperature directly , by monitoring the temperature dependent contact resistance between two separate contacts on the top of each mesa @xcite , which varies approximately as 1/t .",
    "the iv - measurements can then be corrected for the measured temperature rise , which can be as large as a few tens of degrees at the lowest temperatures for large amplitude voltage measurements .",
    "figure 1 shows a typical set of corrected iv - characteristics , obtained quasistatically , for the 1st and 11th phase - slip branches of a mesa on sample # 2 .",
    "once corrected for heating@xcite , the suitably scaled 11th branch can be superimposed on the 1st branch .",
    "such characteristics are dominated by quasi - particle tunnelling , since the mccumber parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the temperature - corrected characteristics are considerably more linear than any previously reported .",
    "additional short - pulse measurements confirm heating to be the major source of non - linearity and back - bending @xcite .",
    "using the voltage at which the dynamic conductance becomes infinite@xcite is therefore unlikely to provide a meaningful measurement of the energy gap .",
    "epsf -10 mm    for a d - wave superconductor with incoherent quasi - particle tunnelling , the tunnel current at low temperatures is expected to vary as @xmath8 . in contrast , the conductance is almost linear over an extended energy range , with @xmath9 as indicated in figure 1 .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the temperature dependence of the derived ohmic conductivity in the low - bias limit for our three samples .",
    "also included are normal state values , extended somewhat below @xmath10 by the application of a large field ( 6.6 t ) parallel to the c - direction .",
    "epsf -10 mm    interestingly , there is no significant change in the conductance nor its temperature dependence at @xmath10 . on decreasing temperature , the low - bias conductance falls continuously from its high temperature normal state value to a doping - dependent limiting value at low temperatures ( see inset ) .",
    "similar results have also been reported by latyshev _ _ et al__@xcite for measurements on ion - beam milled , 2212-bscco , c - axis microbridges fabricated from single - crystal whiskers .",
    "they interpret their measurements in terms of additional impurity - induced states close to the nodes of the d - wave superconductor gap . for coherent interlayer tunnelling , such states would contribute a low bias , ohmic , tunnel current @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the impurity scattering limited energy scale , in contrast to the @xmath8 dependence in the clean limit@xcite . for coherent tunnelling ,",
    "the conductivity would be reduced by an additional factor @xmath13@xcite .",
    "we therefore expect a crossover from an impurity - limited v - dependence to intrinsic @xmath8 tunnelling , when @xmath14 or when @xmath15 .",
    "the only significant difference between our results and those of latyshev _ et al _ are the somewhat smaller values of @xmath16 derived for samples of similar expected doping .",
    "for magnetic fields along the c - direction , the field penetrates as a series of flux pancakes with induced currents largely confined to the cuo planes . in a defect free crystal at low temperatures , the flux pancakes would align to form a uniform lattice of flux lines along the c - direction .",
    "however , thermal fluctuations and crystal defects disturb the alignment of the pancakes , destroying the phase coherence across the planes , hence reducing the critical current by an amount @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the local phase difference across adjacent superconducting planes and @xmath19 represents the thermally averaged spatial average .",
    "typical measurements of the field dependence of the critical current are shown in figures 3 and 4 for modest fields up to 0.1 t and for larger fields up to 7 t .",
    "measurements were taken on cooling and subsequent warming in the applied field , to ensure a nearly uniform distribution of flux .",
    "epsf -10 mm    epsf -10 mm    in zero field , the critical current decreases with increasing temperature , though with a different temperature dependence from bcs .",
    "the linear temperature dependence at low temperatures is inconsistent with the higher power - dependence of the c - axis penetration depth and theoretical models .",
    "this may , in part , be associated with self - heating , which was not monitored in these earlier measurements .",
    "figures 3 and 4 suggest changes in both field and temperature dependences of the critical current as we pass from the solid to liquid vortex states , particularly at the higher fields . the position of the melting line @xmath20 , inferred from @xmath21sr and ac susceptibility measurements ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) on similar crystals , is indicated by the large open circles .",
    "the correlation of flux pancakes across adjacent superconducting planes therefore depends on the nature of the magnetic state .    at low temperatures @xmath22 we also observe an instability in the iv characteristics , illustrated in figure 5 .",
    "provided measurements are confined to the first one or two phase - slip transitions , the critical current remains high , increasing monotonically on decreasing temperature with no significant change in form of the iv - characteristics . however , once a critical voltage has been exceeded , there is an immediate irreversible transition to an entirely new dynamic state , indicated by the lower set of characteristics in figure 5 , with critical currents given by the open circles in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "the original characteristics can only be recovered by annealing the mesa above @xmath23 .",
    "almost identical behaviour has been observed for mesas on all three samples .",
    "this change in phase - slip dynamics is not understood , but almost certainly accounts for the decrease in critical currents at low temperatures reported previously@xcite .",
    "a similar bimodal behaviour has been reported by suzuki _ _",
    "et al__@xcite .",
    "epsf -10 mm    small transverse misalignment of the pancakes vortices d ( @xmath24 ) results in a reversed josephson coupling energy over an area @xmath25 per flux line , where @xmath26 is the anisotropy factor and s the bilayer spacing . for small fields ,",
    "this will lead to a fractional decrease in critical current @xmath27 , consistent with the low - field @xmath28 dependence shown in figure 6 , where @xmath29 725 gauss and 190 gauss for the glassy lattice state at 10k and liquid state at 75k .",
    "this corresponds to displacements d @xmath1 165 nm and @xmath1 330 nm , @xmath30 assuming an anisotropy factor of @xmath1300 .",
    "epsf -10 mm    at higher fields , a simple model of flux pancakes of effective area @xmath31 , randomly distributed such that @xmath32 , would give give a fractional reduction in josephson current @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the josephson coupling energy per unit area .",
    "this result was derived more rigorously by koshelev for pancakes in the liquid state @xcite .",
    "a similar result is also expected for flux lines thermally diffusing in the solid @xcite with @xmath35 , with @xmath36 for random disorder and @xmath37 for increased in - plane correlation . in the solid state at low temperatures",
    "the field dependence approaches @xmath38 at large fields and 1/b in the liquid state at high temperatures , as illustrated by the solid lines in fig 5 .",
