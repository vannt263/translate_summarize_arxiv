    "<S> quantum algorithms could be much faster than classical ones in solving the factoring problem . </S>",
    "<S> adiabatic quantum computation for this is an alternative approach other than shor s algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> here we report an improved adiabatic factoring algorithm and its experimental realization to factor the number @xmath0 on a liquid crystal nmr quantum processor with dipole - dipole couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we believe this to be the largest number factored in quantum - computation realizations , which shows the practical importance of adiabatic quantum algorithms .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1    multiplying two integers is often easy while its inverse operation - decomposing an integer into a product of two unknown factors - is hard . in fact , no effective methods in classical computers is available now to factor a large number which is a product of two prime integers@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> based on this lack of factoring ability , cryptographic techniques such as rsa have ensured the safety of secure communications@xcite . however , shor proposed his famous factoring algorithm@xcite in 1994 which could factor a larger number in polynomial time with the size of the number on a quantum computer . </S>",
    "<S> early experimental progresses have been done to demonstrate the core process of shor s algorithm on liquid - state nmr@xcite and photonic systems@xcite for the simplest case - the factoring of number 15 .    while traditional quantum algorithms including shor s algorithm </S>",
    "<S> are represented in circuit model , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , computation performed by a sequence of discrete operations , a new kind of quantum computation based on the adiabatic theory was proposed by farhi _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where the system was driven by a continuously - varying hamiltonian . unlike circuit - based quantum algorithms , adiabatic quantum computation ( aqc ) is designed for a large class of optimization problems - problems to find the best one among all possible assignments . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , aqc shows a better robustness against error caused by dephasing , environmental noise and imperfection of unitary operations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus it has grown up rapidly as an attractive field of quantum computation researches .    </S>",
    "<S> several computational hard problems have been formulated as optimization problems and solved in the architecture of aqc , for example the 3-sat problem , deutsch s problem and quantum database search@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently peng _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite have adopted a simple scheme to solve the factoring problem in aqc and implemented it on a liquid - state nmr system to factor the number 21 . however </S>",
    "<S> , this scheme could be very hard for large applications due to the exponentially - growing spectrum width of the problem hamiltonian . at the same time , another adiabatic factoring scheme provided by schaller and sch@xmath1tzhold @xcite could suppress the spectrum width and shows to be much faster than classical factoring algorithms or even an exponential speed - up .    </S>",
    "<S> however , schaller and sch@xmath1tzhold s original factoring scheme is too hard to be implemented for any nontrival factoring cases on current quantum processors . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we improve the original scheme to use less resources by simplifing the equations mathematically . and </S>",
    "<S> a factoring case of @xmath0 is choosed as an example to be resolved in this scheme and finally experimentally implemented on a liquid - crystal nmr system with dipolar couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we believe this to be the largest number factored on quantum computation realizations .    as mentioned before </S>",
    "<S> , aqc was originally proposed to solve the optimization problem . </S>",
    "<S> because the solution space of an optimization problem grows exponentially with the size of problem , to find the best one is very hard for the classical computers when the problem s size is large . in the framework of aqc </S>",
    "<S> , a quantum system is prepared in the ground state of initial hamiltonian @xmath2 , while the possible solutions of the problem is encoded to the eignestates state of problem hamiltonian @xmath3 and the best solution to its ground state . for the computation , </S>",
    "<S> the time - dependent hamiltonian varies from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , and if this process performs slowly enough , the quantum adiabatic theorem will ensure the system stays in its instantaneous ground state . </S>",
    "<S> so in the end , the system will be in the ground state of @xmath3 which denotes the best solution of the problem </S>",
    "<S> . simply the time - dependent hamiltonian is realized by an interpolation scheme @xmath4h_{0}+s(t)h_{p}\\ , , \\label{e.hsys}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath5 varies from 0 to 1 to parametrize the interpolation . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of the optimization problem could be determined by an measurement of the system after the computation .    here </S>",
    "<S> , the factoring problem is expressed as a formula @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the known product while @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the prime factors to be found . </S>",
    "<S> the key part of adiabatic factoring algorithm is to convert the factoring problem to an optimization problem , and solve it under the aqc architecture . </S>",
    "<S> the most straightforward scheme is to represent the formula as an equation @xmath10 and form a cost function @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a non - negative integer and @xmath13 is the minimal value of the function . </S>",
    "<S> the problem hamiltonian @xmath3 could be constructed with the same form of @xmath14 _ i.e. _ @xmath15 ^ 2 $ ] , where both @xmath16 and @xmath17 are number operators formed by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the bit width of the number and @xmath20 is the @xmath21 operator representing the @xmath22th bit . </S>",
    "<S> thus the ground state of @xmath3 has the zero energy which denotes the case that @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> after the adiabatic evolution and measurement , we could get the result @xmath8 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> peng _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite have implemented this scheme experimentally to factor 21 . however in this scheme , the spectrum of problem hamiltonian scales with the number @xmath7 , thus it is very hard to implement in experiment when @xmath7 is large .    to avoid this drawback , </S>",
    "<S> schaller and sch@xmath1tzhold@xcite adopted another scheme by burges@xcite to map the factoring problem to an optimization problem . </S>",
    "<S> their adiabatic factoring algorithm starts with a binary - multiplication table which is shown in tab.[bmt ] . in the table , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the first two rows represent the bits of the multipliers and the following four rows are the intermediate results of the multiplication and @xmath26 are the carries from @xmath22th bit to the @xmath27th bit . </S>",
    "<S> the last row is the binary representation of number @xmath7 to be factorized . in order to get a nontrivial case , we set @xmath7 to be odd , thus the last bit ( _ i.e. _ the least significant bit ) of multipliers is binary value @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the bit width of @xmath7 should equal the summation of the two multipliers width . for a given product n , </S>",
    "<S> the combinations of these two multipliers bit width are bounded linearly with @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> so we could just focus on a specific combination where the bit widths of the numbers equals with each other and set the first bit ( _ i.e. _ most significant bit ) to be @xmath28 .    </S>",
    "<S> then , the factoring equations could be got from each column in tab.[bmt ] , where all the variables @xmath29 in the equations are binary . to construct the problem hamiltonian , first we construct bit - wise hamiltonian for each equation by directly mapping the binary variables to operators on qubits , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ @xmath30 , where each symbol with hat is the corresponding operator @xmath31 of the qubit for each variable . </S>",
    "<S> then the problem hamiltonian @xmath32 is a summation of all the bit - wise hamiltonians . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , the ground state of @xmath3 encodes the two factors that satisfy all the bit - wise equations and is the answer to our factoring problem . </S>",
    "<S> thus the spectrum of @xmath3 will not scale with @xmath7 but @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c    &  &  &  & @xmath28 & @xmath34 & @xmath35 & 1 +  &  &  &  & @xmath28 & @xmath36 & @xmath37 & 1 +  &  &  &  & @xmath28 & @xmath34 & @xmath35 & 1 +  &  &  & @xmath37 & @xmath38 & @xmath39 & @xmath37 &   +  &  & @xmath36 & @xmath40 & @xmath41 & @xmath36 &  &   +  & @xmath28 & @xmath34 & @xmath35 & 1 &  &  &   + @xmath42 & @xmath43 & @xmath44 & @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 &  &   + @xmath48 & @xmath49 & @xmath50 & @xmath51 &   &  &  &   + @xmath28 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & @xmath52 & @xmath28 & @xmath28 & @xmath28 & @xmath28 +    however , for the example of our interest , the schaller and sch@xmath1tzhold s scheme@xcite need at least @xmath53 qubits to factor the number 143 , which exceeds the limitation of current quantum computation technology . </S>",
    "<S> so in our experiment , we introduce a mathematical simplification to reduce the number of equations in the above scheme due to the requirement that all the variables should be @xmath52 or @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the first equation @xmath54 , for example , @xmath47 must be @xmath52 otherwise the equation could not be satisfied , and so @xmath55 . after applying the same rule to all the equations , we can get a new group of equations , which are : @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously this reduction rule costs a polynomial time with the number of equations .    to construct the problem hamiltonian from this simplified equations , the bit - wise hamiltonians are constructed by @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . but </S>",
    "<S> this construction method causes @xmath62 to have a four - body interactions , which is hard to be implemented experimentally . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> schaller and sch@xmath1tzhold@xcite introduced another construction form that for the equation like @xmath63 , the problem hamiltonian could be constructed by @xmath64 ^ 2-\\frac{1}{8}$ ] , which could reduce one order of the many - body interactions in experiment . </S>",
    "<S> thus we replace the third bit - wise hamiltonian as @xmath65 ^ 2 - \\frac{1}{8}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> so the problem hamiltonian is , @xmath66 where the operators @xmath67 and @xmath68 are mapped into the qubits space as @xmath69 and @xmath70    for the adiabatic evolution , without the loss of generality , we choose the initial hamiltonian @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a parameter to scale the spectrum of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> and the ground state of the operator is @xmath73- a superposition of all the possible states . </S>",
    "<S> so for the computation , we prepare the system on the state @xmath74 with the hamiltonian being @xmath2 , and slowly vary the hamiltonian from @xmath2 to @xmath3 according to eq.([e.hsys ] ) , the quantum adiabatic theorem ensures that the system will be at the ground state of @xmath3 , which represents the answer to the problem of interests .    </S>",
    "<S> we numerically simulate the process of factoring 143 as shown in fig.[sim ] . </S>",
    "<S> specially , the ground state of the problem hamiltonian in eq.([hp ] ) is degenerated . </S>",
    "<S> this is because two multipliers @xmath8 and @xmath9 have the same bit width , thus an exchange of @xmath8 and @xmath9 also denotes the right answer . from the simulation , we could see that the prime factors of 143 is 11 and 13 .     </S>",

    "<S> the four qubits are represented by the four @xmath76h nuclear spins in 1-bromo-2-chlorobenzene ( c@xmath79h@xmath80clbr ) which is dissolved in the liquid crystal solvent zli-1132 at temperature 300 k. the structure of the molecule is shown in fig.[sample_spectrum]a and the four qubits are marked by the ovals . by fitting the thermal equilibrium spectrum in fig.[sample_spectrum]b , the natural hamltonian of the four - qubit system in the rotating frame is @xmath81 where the chemical shifts @xmath82hz , @xmath83hz , @xmath84hz , @xmath85hz , the dipolar couplings strengthes @xmath86hz , @xmath87hz , @xmath88hz , @xmath89hz , @xmath90hz , @xmath91hz and the j - couplings @xmath92hz , @xmath93hz , @xmath94hz , @xmath95hz , @xmath96hz , @xmath97hz . </S>",
    "<S> the labeling transition scheme for the energy levels is shown in fig.[sample_spectrum]c .    </S>",
    "<S> the whole experimental procedure can be described as three steps : preparation of the ground state of @xmath2 , adiabatic passage by the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath98 , and measurement of the final state . </S>",
    "<S> starting from thermal equilibrium , we firstly created the pseudo - pure state(pps ) @xmath99 , where @xmath100 describes the thermal polarization of the system and @xmath101 is an unit matrix . </S>",

    "<S> a ) c ) spectra corresponding to the pps @xmath102 and @xmath108 by applying a small angle flip ( 3@xmath109 ) pulse . </S>",

    "<S> 33 and no . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . ]    in the experiment , the adiabatic evolution was approximated by @xmath110 discrete steps@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we utilized the linear interpolation @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the total evolution time . </S>",
    "<S> thus the time evolution for each adiabatic step is @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the duration of each step , and @xmath115 is the intermediate hamiltonian of the _ _ m__th step . </S>",
    "<S> and the total evolution applied on the initial state is @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> the adiabatic condition is satisfied when @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> here we chose the parameters @xmath118 and @xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> numerical simlation shows that the probabilities of the system on the ground states of @xmath3 is @xmath120 , which means that we could achieve the right answer to the factoring problem of 143 almost definitely . </S>",
    "<S> we packed together the unitary operators every five adiabatic steps in one shaped pulse calculated by the grape method@xcite , with the length of each pulse @xmath121 and the fidelity with the theoretical operator over @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> so the total evolution time is about @xmath123 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we measured all the diagonal elements of the final density matrix @xmath124 using the hamiltonian s diagonalization method@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> 32 reading - out grape pulses for population measurement were used after the adiabatic evolution , with each pulse s length @xmath125 . </S>",
    "<S> combined with the normalization condition @xmath126 , we reconstructed all the diagonal elements of the final state @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> step @xmath127 of fig.[sim]b shows the experimental result of all the diagonal elements excluding the decoherence through compensating the attenuation factor @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the total evolution time @xmath130 and @xmath131 is the decoherence time @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment ( step @xmath127 ) agrees well with the theoretical expectations ( step @xmath133 ) , showing that the factors of 143 is @xmath134 and @xmath135 .    on the other hand , to illustrate the result more directly from the nmr experiment , a comprehensible spectrum was also given by applying a small angle flip ( 3@xmath109 ) after two @xmath136 operators on the second and third qubit and one gradient pulse , @xmath137 for the liquid crystal sample , since the hamiltonian includes non - diagonal elements , the eigenstates are not zeeman product states but their linear combinations , except @xmath138 and @xmath139 . </S>",
    "<S> if there just exist two populations @xmath140 and @xmath141 , the spectrum would be comprehensible as containing only two main peaks after a small angle pulse excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the motivation of adding the @xmath136 pulses after the adiabatic evolution is conversing @xmath142 and @xmath143 to @xmath140 and @xmath141 , while the gradient pulse was used to make the output @xmath144 concentrated on the diagonal elements of the density matrix . </S>",
    "<S> thus the small angle flip observation would be easily compared with @xmath145 and @xmath146 ( fig.[lc4r ] ) , indicating that the factors of 143 is @xmath134 and @xmath135 .    to be concluded , we improved the adiabatic factoring scheme and implemented it to factor 143 in our nmr platform . </S>",
    "<S> the sample we used for experiment is oriented in the liquid crystal thus it has dipole - dipole coupling interactions which are utilized for the computation . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental result matches well with theoretical expectations . to our knowledge , this is the first experimental realization of quantum algorithms to factor a number larger than 100 . </S>"
