    "the theory of regular chains , since its introduction by j.f .",
    "ritt  @xcite , has been applied successfully in many areas including parametric algebraic systems  @xcite , differential systems  @xcite , difference systems  @xcite , intersection multiplicity  @xcite , unmixed decompositions  @xcite and primary decomposition  @xcite of polynomial ideals , cylindrical algebraic decomposition  @xcite , parametric  @xcite and non - parametric  @xcite semi - algebraic systems . today",
    ", regular chains are at the core of algorithms for triangular decomposition of polynomial systems , which are available in several software packages  @xcite .",
    "moreover , these algorithms provide back - engines for computer algebra system front - end solvers , such as maple s solve command .",
    "one of the algorithmic strengths of the theory of regular chains is its _ regularity test _ procedure . given a polynomial @xmath2 and a regular chain @xmath0 , both in a multivariate polynomial ring @xmath3 $ ] over a field , this procedure computes regular chains @xmath4 such that @xmath4 is a decomposition of @xmath0 in some technical sense   is equal to the intersection of the radicals of the saturated ideals of @xmath4 . ] and for each @xmath5 the polynomial @xmath2 is either null or regular modulo the saturated ideal of @xmath6 . thanks to the d5 principle  @xcite , this regularity test avoids factorization into irreducible polynomials and involves only polynomial gcd and resultant computations .",
    "one of the technical difficulties of this theory , however , is the fact that regular chains do not fit well in the `` usual algebraic - geometric dictionary '' ( chapter 4 , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the `` good '' zero set encoded by a regular chain @xmath0 is a constructible set @xmath7 , called the _ quasi - component _ of @xmath0 , which does not correspond exactly to the `` good '' ideal encoded by @xmath0 , namely , the _ saturated ideal _ of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the affine variety defined by equals @xmath8 , that is , the zariski closure of @xmath7 .",
    "for this reason , a decomposition algorithm , such as the one of m.  kalkbrener  @xcite ( which , for an input polynomial ideal @xmath9 computes regular chains @xmath4 such that @xmath10 equals the intersection of the radicals of the saturated ideals of @xmath4 ) can not be seen as a decomposition algorithm for the variety @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , the output of kalkbrener s algorithm yields @xmath12 while a decomposition of the form @xmath13 would be more explicit .",
    "kalkbrener s decompositions , and in fact all decompositions of differential ideals  @xcite raise another notorious issue : the _ ritt problem _ , stated as follows . given two regular chains ( algebraic or differential ) @xmath0 and @xmath14 ,",
    "check whether the inclusion of saturated ideals @xmath15 holds or not . in the algebraic case",
    ", this inclusion can be tested by computing a set of generators of @xmath16 , using grbner bases . in practice , this solution is too expensive for the purpose of removing redundant components in kalkbrener s decompositions and only some criteria are applied  @xcite . in the differential case , there has not even an algorithmic solution .    in the algebraic case",
    ", both issues would be resolved if one would have a practically efficient procedure with the following specification : for the regular chain @xmath0 compute regular chains @xmath4 such that we have @xmath17 .",
    "if in addition , such procedure does not require a system of generators of @xmath16 , this might suggest a solution in the differential version of the ritt problem .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a solution to this algorithmic quest , in the algebraic case .",
    "to be precise , our procedure computes the _ non - trivial limit points _ of the quasi - component @xmath7 , that is , the set @xmath18 .",
    "this turns out to be @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the hypersurface defined by the product of the initials of @xmath0 .",
    "we focus on the case where the saturated ideal of @xmath0 has dimension one . in section",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we sketch a solution in higher dimension .",
    "when the regular chain @xmath0 consists of a single polynomial @xmath21 , primitive w.r.t .",
    "its main variable , one can easily check that @xmath22 holds .",
    "unfortunately , there is no generalization of this result when @xmath0 consists of several polynomials , unless @xmath0 enjoys remarkable properties , such as being a _ primitive regular chain _  @xcite . to overcome this difficulty , it becomes necessary to view @xmath0 as a `` parametric representation '' of the quasi - component @xmath7 . in this setting ,",
    "the points of @xmath23 can be computed as limits ( in the usual sense of the euclidean topology   in zariski topology and the euclidean topology holds when is . ] ) of sequences of points along `` branches '' ( in the sense of the theory of algebraic curves ) of @xmath7 .",
    "it turns out that these limits can be obtained as constant terms of convergent puiseux series defining the `` branches '' of @xmath7 in the neighborhood of the points of interest .",
    "here comes the main technical difficulty of this approach .",
    "when computing a particular point of @xmath23 , one needs to follow one branch per defining equation of @xmath0 . following a branch",
    "means computing a truncated puiseux expansion about a point .",
    "since the equation of @xmath0 defining a given variable , say @xmath24 , depends on the equations of @xmath0 defining the variables @xmath25 , the truncated puiseux expansion for @xmath24 is defined by an equation whose coefficients involve the truncated puiseux expansions for @xmath25 .    from sections  [ sec :",
    "theory ] to  [ sec : principle ] , we show that this principle indeed computes the desired limit points .",
    "in particular , we introduce the notion of a _ system of puiseux parametrizations of a regular chain _ , see section  [ sec : theory ] . this allows to state in theorem  [ thrm : puiseuxparamrc ] a concise formula for @xmath23 in terms of this latter notion .",
    "then , we estimate to which accuracy one needs to effectively compute such a system of puiseux parametrizations in order to deduce @xmath23 , see theorem  [ theorem : bound - general ] in section  [ sec : bounds ] .    in section  [ section ] , we report on a preliminary implementation of the algorithms presented in this paper .",
    "we evaluate our code by applying it to the question of removing redundant components in kalkbrener s decompositions and observe the benefits of this strategy .    in order to facilitate the presentation of those technical materials",
    ", we dedicate section  [ sec : limitpoints ] to the case of regular chains in @xmath26 variables . section  [ sec : preliminaries ] briefly reviews notions from the theories of regular chains and algebraic curves .",
    "we conclude this introduction with a detailed example .",
    "consider the regular chain @xmath27 $ ] with @xmath28 .",
    "then , we have @xmath29 . to determine , we need to compute puiseux series expansions of @xmath30 about @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",

    "the two puiseux expansions of @xmath30 about @xmath31 are : @xmath33,\\ ] ] + @xmath34.\\end{array}\\ ] ] the second expansion does not result in a new limit point .",
    "after , substituting the first expansion into @xmath35 , we have : @xmath36 now , we compute puiseux series expansions of @xmath37 which are @xmath38,\\ ] ] + @xmath39.\\end{array}\\ ] ] so the regular chains @xmath40 and @xmath41 give the limit points of @xmath7 about @xmath31 .",
    "next , we consider @xmath32 .",
    "we compute puiseux series expansions of @xmath30 about the point @xmath32 .",
    "we have : @xmath42,\\ ] ] + @xmath43.\\end{array}\\ ] ] after substitution into @xmath35 , we obtain : @xmath44 so those puiseux expansions of @xmath45 and @xmath46 about @xmath47 which result in a limit point are as follows :    * for @xmath45 : @xmath48 $ ] * for @xmath46 : @xmath49 $ ]    thus , the limit points of @xmath0 about the point @xmath32 can be represented by the regular chains @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "one can check that a triangular decomposition of the system @xmath52 is @xmath53 and , thus , does not yield @xmath54 , but in fact a superset of it .",

    "after substitution into the polynomial @xmath754 , we apply puiseux theorem and compute the limit points of @xmath757 extending @xmath2 , in the manner of the algorithms of section  [ sec : principle ] .",
    "there are new challenges , however , w.r.t .",
    "to the one - dimensional case .",
    "first , parametrizations may involve now more than one parameter .",
    "when this happens , one should use jung - abhyankar theorem  @xcite instead of the puiseux theorem .",
