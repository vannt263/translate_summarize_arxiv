    "following a suggestion by geroch ( colloquium , princeton univ . , dec .",
    "1971 ) , bekenstein ( 1972 ) described an engine that makes use of the extreme gravitational potential of a black hole ( bh ) to convert mass to energy with nearly perfect efficiency .",
    "the engine works by slowly lowering a mass @xmath0 into the bh potential using a strong wire .",
    "as the mass is lowered , the energy @xmath1 as measured at infinity decreases relative to the initial energy @xmath2 .",
    "the change in energy is equal to the mechanical work done by the wire back at the engine . for a non - rotating",
    "bh , if the mass is lowered from an initially large radius down to a final radius @xmath3 , and if the mass is then allowed to fall freely into the bh , the efficiency of the engine is @xmath4/mc^2 = \\left [ 1- ( 1 - 1/r)^{1/2 } \\right].\\ ] ] here @xmath5 is the radius in schwarzschild units , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the bh mass . as @xmath8 all the rest mass energy of @xmath0 is converted into work , and @xmath9 .",
    "the geroch - bekenstein engine is not believed to occur naturally in astrophysical systems .",
    "astrophysical bhs do convert mass to energy , but they do it via accretion flows ( see kato , fukue & mineshige 1998 for a review ) , which generally have modest efficiencies .",
    "we describe in  2 a kind of accretion flow that was originally discussed by bisnovatyi - kogan & ruzmaikin ( 1974 , 1976 , hereafter bkr74 , bkr76 ) and that has been seen in recent computer mhd simulations .",
    "we argue in  3 that this flow has a high efficiency , and we conclude in  4 with a brief discussion .",
    "figure 1a shows the basic idea .",
    "we assume that a significant amount of poloidal magnetic flux has collected in the vicinity of the bh as a result of the cumulative action of the accretion flow , and that the magnetic field is dynamically dominant .",
    "the field is prevented from escaping by the continued inward pressure of accretion . at the same time",
    ", the field lines do not fall into the bh because the bh only `` wants '' the plasma but `` does not want '' the field ( punsly 2001 , ch . 8) .",
    "the accumulated poloidal field disrupts the accretion flow at a magnetospheric radius @xmath10 , which lies well outside the event horizon of the bh . for @xmath11 , the flow is essentially axisymmetric , as in any standard accretion flow .",
    "however , for @xmath12 , the flow breaks up into blobs or streams , and the gas has to fight its way towards the bh by a process of magnetic interchanges and reconnection .",
    "the velocity of the gas in this region is much less than the free - fall velocity @xmath13 .",
    "we call such a disrupted accretion flow a `` magnetically arrested disk '' or mad for short .",
    "( 60mm,60mm)f1a.eps ( 60mm,60mm)f1b.eps    a similar idea was discussed by bkr74 , who highlighted the importance of a large - scale dipole magnetic field in a non - rotating accretion flow ( compare their fig . 1 to our fig",
    "later , the same authors constucted a quantitative version of the model ( bkr76 ) using a prescription for the resistivity of a turbulent plasma analogous to the @xmath14-viscosity of turbulent hydrodynamics .",
    "these old ideas have been confirmed in recent 3d mhd simulations of radiatively inefficient accretion flows around bhs carried out by us ( igumenshchev & narayan 2002 ; igumenshchev , narayan & abramowicz 2003 ; see especially model b in the latter paper ) . in the simulations ,",
    "frozen - in magnetic flux is dragged to the center by the accreting gas , causing a substantial increase in the magnetic pressure .",
    "this leads to a severe disruption of the originally axisymmetric flow , and a substantial reduction in the gas velocity .",
    "can we be sure that the magnetic field will become strong enough to disrupt the accretion flow ?",
    "the answer is yes , at least under the idealized conditions we have considered where the accreting gas brings in magnetic field of a fixed polarity .",
    "initially the field near the bh is not strong enough , so the gas accretes without hindrance .",
    "however , continued accretion keeps bringing in more field and the magnetic pressure near the bh builds up with time .",
    "whatever pressure is needed to disrupt the disk will ultimately be achieved , given enough time ; after that , a mad flow is inevitable .",
    "the computer simulations mentioned above were done for a radiatively inefficient accretion flow .",
    "radiatively efficient disks are sometimes cool enough to be mostly neutral , in which case the magnetic field would slip through the gas via ambipolar diffusion , preventing the accumulation of field at the center .",
    "in addition , there could be substantial field slippage even in a fully ionized disk , if the anomalous magnetic diffusivity is large ( lovelace , romanova & newman 1994 ; lubow , papaloizou & pringle 1994ab ) .",
    "however , if magnetic winds play an important role in the angular momentum loss , then it is plausible that significant field will be dragged to the center . in",
    "what follows , we make the optimistic assumption that field - dragging is efficient and that a configuration as in fig .",
    "1a does develop .",
    "magnetically disrupted disks are known in another context , namely accretion onto magnetized neutron stars and white dwarfs .",
    "a strong field anchored in the star disrupts the accretion flow at a magnetospheric radius @xmath15 , as shown in fig .",
    "the topology of the field is , however , very different , since in this case the gas inside @xmath16 is able to flow in freely along field lines down to the magnetic poles of the star . in the configuration shown in fig .",
    "1a , on the other hand , there is no field line connecting gas at radius @xmath17 to the bh horizon .",
    "the only way for gas to move inward is by diffusing ( via magnetic interchanges ) through the strong magnetic field .",
    "this results in a low velocity and a high energy efficiency (  3 ) .",
    "let us estimate the magnetospheric radius @xmath17 in a mad flow . by assumption",
    ", the gas inside @xmath17 moves with a radial component of the velocity @xmath18 , with @xmath19 fairly small .",
    "in the numerical simulations of igumenshchev et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , @xmath19 was found to be @xmath20 .",
    "this value is possibly an overestimate since the diffusion was dominated by numerical resistivity .",
    "elsner & lamb ( 1984 ) , kaisig , tajima , & lovelace ( 1992 ) and ikhsanov ( 2001 , and references therein ) discuss the physics of diffusion via magnetic reconnection and interchanges , and show that the diffusion velocity is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a dimensionless constant , @xmath23 is the linear size of reconnection sites , and @xmath24 is the alfven speed . setting @xmath25 , this gives @xmath26 .",
    "in the following , we scale all results to @xmath27 .    the surface density @xmath28 of the gas inside @xmath17 is given by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the mass accretion rate . since the magnetic field supports the gas against gravity , we require @xmath31 ( assuming @xmath32 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath33 g , where @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , with @xmath36 .",
    "assuming @xmath19 is independent of @xmath37 , we may integrate @xmath38 over radius to estimate the magnetic flux @xmath39 enclosed within @xmath17 .",
    "inverting this relation , we find @xmath40 the above estimate should be valid for both spherical and rotating flows , except that @xmath19 is perhaps somewhat smaller for rotating flows",
    ".    how much magnetic flux do we expect to collect at the center ?",
    "for a mad configuration to form it is necessary that the inflowing gas should have the same sign of @xmath38 ( where @xmath41 is taken to be parallel to the rotation axis of the flow ) for an extended period of time ( bkr74 ) .",
    "in the local ism near the sun , the magnetic field strength is a few @xmath42 g and the coherence scale of the field is a few hundred pc or greater .",
    "the magnetic flux in a coherent magnetic patch is thus @xmath43 .",
    "the flux in a spatially coherent patch in the nucleus of a galaxy is uncertain , but is probably at least comparable ( e.g. , lang , morris & echevarria 1999 ) . if a flux of this magnitude is dragged by accretion to the vicinity of a supermassive bh , equation ( 2 ) shows that the accretion disk will be disrupted at quite a large radius . even if only a tiny fraction of the flux is dragged in",
    ", a mad configuration should still develop . with continued accretion ,",
    "the magnitude of the flux will random - walk , as the field in successive coherence volumes will be uncorrelated , but the overall picture should not change . in a differentially - rotating accretion disk , additional magnetic field will be generated via the magneto - rotational instability .",
    "this may lead to stochastic mad - like behavior ( e.g. , livio , pringle & king 2003 ) , with the field reversing on short time scales .    for an accretion disk in a binary system ,",
    "the relevant quantities are the strength of the field in the outer layers of the donor star and the coherence time of the field in the star , i.e. , how long the star retains a given sign of @xmath38 .",
    "this topic is beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "we define the efficiency @xmath44 to be the ratio of the energy that flows out to infinity to the rest energy of the accreting gas ( eq.[1 ] ) .",
    "unlike a standard thin accretion disk , where the energetically efficient zone lies outside the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) and the gas free - falls inside the isco , the gas in a mad system has no free - fall region .",
    "the arresting action of the magnetic field ensures that the gas moves slowly all the way down to the bh horizon . in the igumenshchev et al .",
    "( 2003 ) simulation , not only is the radial velocity small ( @xmath45 ) , the tangential velocity is also very small since the gas loses its angular momentum efficiently through drag on the poloidal magnetic field .",
    "thus , the gas has very little kinetic energy , and essentially all its rest mass energy appears in other forms , e.g. , heat or radiation or a mechanical / magnetic outflow .",
    "this leads to a high efficiency , just as in the geroch - bekenstein engine .",
    "the only question is what fraction of the released energy actually escapes to infinity .",
    "inside @xmath17 , where the gas breaks up into magnetically confined blobs ( or streams as in the igumenshchev et al .",
    "2003 mhd simulations ) , the energy released will go partly into heating the blobs and partly into heating the surrounding medium , which we call a `` corona . ''",
    "let us assume that the blobs are optically thick and that nearly all of their heat energy is emitted as radiation . to avoid complications ,",
    "assume that the radiation comes out isotropically in the rest frame relative to the bh ( we ignore doppler beaming since the velocity is small ) .",
    "in addition , some of the energy that is deposited in the corona may also be radiated locally and isotropically .",
    "we refer to all of this emission as `` disk radiation . ''",
    "let us say that a fraction @xmath46 of the energy released at each radius is emitted as disk radiation .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that @xmath47 is independent of @xmath37 .    for a schwarzschild bh , a fraction @xmath48 of isotropically emitted radiation at radius @xmath37 escapes to infinity if @xmath49 ( radii inside the circular photon orbit ) and a fraction @xmath50 escapes if @xmath51 , where @xmath52^{1/2}$ ] . integrating over the differential energy release @xmath53 ( eq.[1 ] ) as a function of radius , we find that a fraction @xmath54 of the rest mass energy of the accreting gas escapes to infinity as radiation , and a fraction @xmath55 of the rest mass energy falls into the bh . the precise value @xmath56 depends on the particular assumptions we have made , but the general result , that nearly half the radiated energy escapes to infinity , is probably quite general .",
    "note that , as in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , all our calculations are done in terms of the energy as measured at infinity .",
    "therefore , gravitational redshift effects are automatically included in the estimates .",
    "the remainder of the energy @xmath57 goes into the corona and comes out partly as a thermal wind and partly as poynting flux . because both of these fluxes flow along the magnetic field lines , all of this energy escapes to infinity .",
    "some of the energy may actually come out as radiation , e.g. , beamed from the outflowing wind or created farther out where the wind meets an external medium .",
    "let a fraction @xmath58 of the rest mass energy of the accreting gas come out in this form of `` jet radiation , '' all of which escapes to infinity .",
    "finally , a fraction @xmath59 remains as mechanical or magnetic energy and flows out into the external medium .",
    "energy is , of course , conserved in this entire process .",
    "if we start with a parcel of gas of mass @xmath0 around a bh of mass @xmath7 and if the gas accretes via a mad flow as described above , then , after the gas has fallen into the bh , the mass of the hole will increase to @xmath60 , and an energy @xmath61 will return to infinity , of which @xmath62 will be in the form of radiation and the rest in a non - radiative form .",
    "we now define two efficiencies : @xmath63 , the ratio of radiative energy reaching infinity to the rest mass energy of the inflowing gas , and @xmath64 , the ratio of the total energy reaching infinity ( radiative , mechanical , magnetic ) to the rest mass energy . from the previous discussion , we obtain @xmath65    bkr76 estimated @xmath66 in their newtonian model of turbulent magnetized accretion , arbitrarily assuming that the effective cut - off radius of the accretion flow is @xmath67 . their estimate is remarkablely close to the more quantitative result we obtain here , which includes relativity and takes the cut - off radius to be @xmath68 .",
    "the analogy between the geroch - bekenstein engine and the mad model is quite close . in the former , a strong wire arrests the falling mass @xmath0 and lowers it slowly into the bh , while at the same time transporting energy out to infinity .",
    "the mad model does the same thing , except that the poloidal magnetic field plays the role of the wire .",
    "the model is thus a practical realization of the geroch - bekenstein engine .",
    "a problem with bekenstein s ( 1972 ) original proposal is that no physical wire is strong enough to survive the intense tidal force of a bh ( gibbons 1972 ) .",
    "however , a poloidal magnetic field with a topology similar to that in the mad model can circumvent gibbons argument ( znajek 1976 ) .",
    "soltan ( 1982 ) has shown that , by comparing the integrated luminosity of qsos with the bh mass density in the local universe , one can estimate the average efficiency of accretion in qsos .",
    "elvis , risaliti & zamorani ( 2002 ) and yu & tremaine ( 2002 ) have used this method to argue for highly efficient accretion , with @xmath69 ( see also merritt & ferrarese 2001 ) . in view of the conservative assumptions made by yu & tremaine ( 2002 ) , and especially the results shown in their fig .",
    "4 , it would appear that the efficiency may be closer to 1 than 0.1 .",
    "the relevant efficiency when considering the soltan argument is not @xmath44 as defined in the present paper , but the ratio @xmath70 of the radiative energy reaching infinity to the mass energy added to the bh . for the mad model described here , @xmath71 the model appears to have a large enough radiative efficiency to satisfy the qso observations .",
    "we have dealt exclusively with the extraction of rest mass energy from the accreting gas ; to emphasize this point , we have focused on a non - rotating bh in our discussion . with a rotating bh , one can in addition extract energy from the bh ( e.g. , blandford & znajek 1977 ; li 2000 ; punsly 2001 ; and references therein ) .",
    "the presence of this additional source of energy is a complicating factor when comparing our model to others in the literature . in the following ,",
    "we focus only on those published models in which the bh spin parameter @xmath72 remains the same before and after the accretion , so that we can be certain that none of the released energy comes from the bh spin .",
    "a standard thin accretion disk around a schwarzschild bh ( @xmath73 ) has @xmath74 , while thorne s ( 1974 ) limiting kerr bh with @xmath75 has @xmath76 .",
    "li & paczyski ( 2000 ) have described a model in which a bh alternates between episodes of accretion spin - up and spin - down , giving a net efficiency of @xmath77 .",
    "gammie ( 1999 ) has discussed a model in which magnetic fields exert a torque on an accretion disk at the isco , and shows that @xmath63 is nearly 0.2 for a schwarzschild bh under ideal conditions and about @xmath78 for an equilibrium kerr bh with @xmath79 .",
    "agol & krolik ( 2000 ) include the effects of returning radiation and show that the maximum efficiency for a bh in spin - equilibrium is 0.36 .",
    "the mad model compares favorably with all these models ( see eqs . [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the large efficiency of the mad model is obtained with a generic magnetic field configuration and for a non - rotating bh .",
    "the mad model is based on a key assumption , namely that radiatively efficient disks drag in external magnetic field to the center .",
    "we await further theoretical and numerical work on this conjecture .",
    "the model also assumes that the gas inside the magnetospheric radius moves slowly relative to free - fall .",
    "although supported by recent 3d mhd simulations ( igumenshchev et al . 2003 ) and other discussions in the literature ( e.g. , ikhsanov 2001 ) , this assumption needs to be tested further .",
