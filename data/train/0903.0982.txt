    "one of the ongoing research lines in heavy ion physics is the thermal and chemical evolution of the expanding hadronic gas . roughly speaking",
    ", the accepted picture is that the evolution of the cooling system reaches chemical freeze - out before the thermal one , so that when hadrons fully decouple the chemical potentials associated to particle number conservation are not zero .",
    "the chemical composition of the gas can be determined experimentally by looking at the relative abundances of the different hadron species and their spectra @xcite .",
    "the presence of such a chemically not - equilibrated phase is more likely to exist for higher collision energies such as those in rhic or lhc than for sps or ags experiments @xcite . for the pion component ,",
    "different estimates based on local thermal equilibrium and particle spectra analyses predict @xmath3 50 - 100 mev at a thermal freeze - out temperature @xmath4 100 - 120 mev , with chemical freeze - out taking place at about @xmath5 180 mev @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the plasma is almost electrically neutral , so that it is a good approximation to keep vanishing charge or isospin chemical pion chemical potentials .    for low and moderate temperatures ,",
    "the dominant component is the pionic one . in that phase ,",
    "the mean free path of pions is small compared to the system size , so that local thermal equilibrium prevails @xcite . on the other hand , the chemical relaxation rate through inelastic @xmath6 processes is very small @xcite due to a strong phase space suppression .",
    "therefore , in the range of temperatures @xmath7 , with @xmath8 the chiral restoration critical temperature , the system is in thermal equilibrium and dominated by elastic collisions so that @xmath2 . in that temperature range",
    ", it is valid to use the theoretical framework of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) and it is also reasonable to adopt a dilute gas description , since the mean particle density is small . in addition , neglecting dissipative effects such as viscosities , entropy is conserved in the evolution .",
    "the system described above , i.e. , a pion gas with @xmath2 is the one we will consider here . clearly , it is an oversimplified version of the real hadron gas , but we will take it as a physically relevant working example for our present analysis .",
    "so far , pion number chemical potential effects in such a system have been incorporated basically in two ways .",
    "one of them is the limit of free particles ( where one has actually exact particle conservation ) used for the evaluation of the partition function , including resonances explicitly @xcite .",
    "this allows , via entropy conservation requirements , to describe rather accurately the isentropic dependence @xmath9 in the range of temperatures of phenomenological relevance indicated above .",
    "the other one is to use kinetic theory arguments to include the @xmath2 dependence directly in the distribution function .",
    "the latter has been followed for instance in the calculation of the thermal width @xcite , in the evaluation of transport coefficients @xcite or in the virial approach for low densities @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that there are phenomenological analyses , like that in @xcite for the dilepton rate , where the same prescription is followed , i.e. , replacing the distribution function , but for propagators at the diagrammatic level , inspired on the nonequilibrium formulation of thermal field theory @xcite",
    ".    we will be interested in a diagrammatic formulation of this system , i.e , we will derive the feynman rules to be used when approximate particle number conservation is valid .",
    "the feynman rules of thermal field theory with _ exact _ conserved charges can be obtained straightforwardly @xcite but this is a completely different situation , since particle number is not exactly conserved in an interacting bosonic field theory ( is only conserved in the free case ) and therefore there is not a local number operator to be added to the lagrangian in the usual way .",
    "this will also be related to the impossibility to define a proper matsubara imaginary - time formalism .",
    "the motivation for our field - theory description is twofold : first , it will provide a formal proof of the consistency and validity of the different prescriptions used in the literature and mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "second , it will allow to deal in a natural way with pion interactions when @xmath2 , which is particularly interesting in order to describe corrections to dynamical quantities such as the thermal pion self - energy , but also to evaluate the effect of interactions in thermodynamical observables .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the first part we will describe our formalism , based on holomorphic path integrals , which naturally leads to the relevant feynman rules . although the results in that part are actually valid for any real scalar field theory provided one neglects the contributions of number - changing scattering processes or , in other words , if the gas is dilute enough , we will be primarily interested in the pion gas , where chemical nonequilibrium is actually reached during the expansion .",
    "we explain more clearly this physical motivation in section [ sec : motivation ] , where we discuss the relevant distribution function to describe the system .",
    "the feynman rules we derive ( section [ sec : formal ] ) had not been considered before in the interacting case and , as we will see , they are really meaningful only in the real - time formalism of thermal field theory .",
    "the second part ( section [ sec : apppion ] ) deals with the application of our formalism to the pion gas .",
    "we will analyze corrections both in thermodynamical ( free energy , entropy , particle number and quark condensate ) and dynamical ( thermal mass and width ) observables , the former being understood as a generalization of the usual thermodynamical variables during the chemical nonequilibrium phase .",
    "we also compare to previous works in the literature and we discuss several phenomenological consequences regarding chiral symmetry restoration , bose - einstein condensation of neutral and charged pions , as well as thermal and chemical freeze - out .",
    "appendices [ app : holo ] and [ app : therprop ] contain detailed results used in the main text about holomorphic path integrals and thermal propagators respectively .",
    "in particular , in appendix [ app : therprop ] we discuss some relevant differences between the case of particle number chemical potential considered here and the more usual one associated to the electric charge exact conservation , concerning especially the way in which kms boundary conditions are broken .",
    "as stated in the introduction , we are interested in describing the physical system constituted by a pion gas in expansion , during the time when the number of pions is approximately conserved .",
    "this is the case of the pionic component of the hadronic gas produced after a relativistic heavy - ion collision .",
    "the pionic component is the dominant one in the hadron gas around thermal freeze out @xcite , although considering additional degrees of freedom in the gas ( kaons , etas , nucleons and resonances ) and the interactions among them is relevant at temperatures close to the chiral phase transition .",
    "we will not consider those extra components here , although their inclusion in the chiral framework , together with the corresponding additional chemical potentials ( strangeness and baryon number ) is a feasible extension of this work .",
    "unlike other treatments @xcite , where it was shown that it is a reasonable approximation to introduce in the partition function all the states ( asymptotic states as well as resonances ) up to a given energy as _ free _ degrees of freedom , in our approach the resonances present in the pion gas , the @xmath10 and the @xmath11 , are generated dynamically by means of unitarization methods so the actual degrees of freedom in the lagrangian are only pions .",
    "it is however important to mention that , even when introduced as explicit degrees of freedom , the processes @xmath12 and @xmath13 do not restore chemical equilibrium in the pionic component , because @xmath14 , the truly relevant particle - changing process being @xmath6 . when pions and resonances are in chemical equilibrium with respect to each other we talk about a _ relative _ chemical equilibrium , since it is possible to choose their chemical potentials to maintain it , whereas _",
    "absolute _ chemical equilibrium is only possible for @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the pionic fireball can be divided into three stages as it cools down according to the corresponding temperature ranges @xcite : ( i ) @xmath16 , the pion gas is produced after hadronization from a quark - gluon plasma phase and it is in full statistical equilibrium ( thermal and chemical ) .",
    "( ii ) @xmath17 , the mean - free path of elastic collisions , @xmath18 is smaller than the typical size of the fireball , @xmath19 @xcite , so that thermal equilibrium is maintained , whereas the mean - free path of inelastic collisions @xmath20 is larger than @xmath21 so the total number of pions @xmath22 remains approximately constant the relaxation time of elastic @xmath23 collision is @xmath24 , whereas the relaxation time of the process @xmath6 is @xmath25 @xcite , the typical mean velocities at those temperatures being @xmath26 .",
    "see also our comments in section [ sec : pimasswidth ] . ] and a finite chemical potential associated to @xmath27 builds up , so that the system is out of chemical equilibrium .",
    "( iii ) @xmath28 , @xmath18 is larger than @xmath21 so the pions stop interacting and their momentum distributions become frozen , so that thermal equilibrium is lost .",
    "we shall analyze the phase ii of the evolution , where the total number of pions is approximately conserved ( and the gas remains dilute enough ) so that the introduction of a finite pion chemical potential @xmath1 associated to @xmath27 is necessary .",
    "the existence of such a chemically not equilibrated phase during the fireball space - time evolution is supported by several phenomenological results .",
    "for instance when analyzing experimental data from the na44 collaboration , it was shown in @xcite that in order to fit properly the pion spectrum at low transverse momentum in pbpb reactions , one needs to introduce a finite chemical potential of order @xmath29 at thermal freeze - out .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached in @xcite for rhic auau collisions .",
    "in addition , the analysis of total particle yields and yield ratios for sps and rhic energies are fitted with values of fugacities compatible with the pionic component being significatively out of chemical equilibrium @xcite .    neglecting electromagnetic interactions ,",
    "the pions are described by neutral scalar fields . for a neutral boson field theory ,",
    "particle number is conserved only in the free case .",
    "our aim here is to provide a field - theory description of the non - equilibrium state corresponding to phase ii . in this respect ,",
    "it is important to remark that there are fundamental differences between total particle number and charges which are exactly conserved by the dynamics , such as the net electric charge or baryon number in qcd . in a pion gas ,",
    "the total number of pions is expressed in terms of individual number operators as @xmath30 whereas electric charge , or the third isospin component ( they are equivalent in the pion @xmath31 case ) is measured by @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the main difference is of course that charge is exactly conserved in the second case , which implies several important consequences : first , from the field - theoretical point of view , in the charge case there is a local charge operator @xmath33 written in terms of the field and its derivatives , which allows for a straightforward derivation of the corresponding feynman rules , adding the usual @xmath34 term to the lagrangian @xcite .",
    "however , that is not the case for particle number , which instead has a natural formulation in terms of canonical creation and annihilation operators .",
    "that is the main reason why we will develop our holomorphic representation of the path integral in section [ sec : formal ] .",
    "second , in the @xmath1 case we are really facing a nonequilibrium description , which is only consistent if @xmath1 and @xmath35 are not independent parameters , the function @xmath36 parameterizing the deviations from chemical equilibrium and vanishing at @xmath37 .",
    "this signals the end of phase ii , or its beginning if we think in terms of proper time , as inverse of temperature evolution in a hydrodynamical description ( remember that in phase ii local thermal equilibrium is assumed ) .",
    "the form of @xmath36 has to be fixed by additional physical assumptions .",
    "we will rely here ( see section [ sec : thermo ] ) on the isentropic condition stating that the ratio of entropy density to pion density @xmath38 remains constant along the chemical evolution , which has phenomenological support @xcite . finally , we remark that these differences between the charge @xmath39 case and the pion number @xmath2 one translate into a different way in which the kms boundary conditions characteristic of equilibrium are broken .",
    "we discuss this issue in detail in appendix [ app : therprop ] . throughout this work we will take @xmath40 , which corresponds to an electrically neutral pion gas , which seems to be well supported by the phenomenological values of the fugacities @xcite .    since the system in phase ii is in thermal equilibrium and there is an approximate conserved operator @xmath41 with chemical potential @xmath1 associated , the appropriate non - equilibrium partition function is @xmath42 where quantities with a tilde will refer always to the nonequilibrium @xmath43 case throughout this paper . by including source terms",
    "we can then derive thermal correlation functions . note that @xmath44 is independent of the position in space ( we consider an homogeneous system ) , but it actually depends on ( proper ) time @xmath45 during the gas expansion through temperature @xmath46 and the chemical potential @xmath47 , along the lines discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "the validity of the out - of-(chemical ) equilibrium distribution function in ( [ partitionf ] ) will be subject to times @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the duration of phase ii .",
    "it is in this nonequilibrium effectively time - dependent situation that our results for the partition function and thermodynamical observables ( see section [ sec : evalz ] ) have to be understood .    for @xmath48 inelastic processes",
    "are scarce at temperatures @xmath17 , therefore if at some time @xmath50 the system is in a state with well defined number of particles equal to @xmath51 , @xmath52 , then at another time @xmath53 with @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and thus in heisenberg s picture @xmath56 and from heisenberg s equation @xmath57 $ ] we infer : @xmath58\\ , \\mathrm{d}t\\quad\\rightarrow\\quad[\\hat{n}(t),\\hat{h}]\\simeq 0\\ , \\quad\\mathrm{for}\\",
    "t_1\\leq t\\leq t_\\mathrm{ii}\\ .\\ ] ] in the following section , the condition @xmath59\\simeq 0 $ ] ( valid for times in phase ii ) will be used to derive a field - theory description of the system based on the holomorphic path - integral representation of the partition function provided by ( [ partitionf ] ) .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , the operator @xmath41 has a non - local representation in terms of the field operator @xcite , so that the appropriate representation for this operator is instead in terms of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the holomorphic path - integral representation uses these convenient operators , and its main ideas can be found in @xcite",
    ". we will give the essential steps of the derivation for our system in this section , more technical aspects being relegated to appendix [ app : holo ] . as we saw in the previous section , the generating functional of thermal correlation functions will be constructed from the non-(chemical)equilibrium partition function ( [ partitionf ] ) . in order to simplify further the discussion , we will consider first a quantum - mechanical gas of bose particles and next we will extend it straightforwardly to the qft case . throughout this section and for simplicity",
    "we use the notation @xmath60 for the chemical potential associated to particle number ( @xmath1 in the pion gas case , which we will analyze extensively in section [ sec : apppion ] ) .",
    "let us consider then a single - frequency quantum oscillator ( free hamiltonian ) coupled to an external force @xmath61 .",
    "the hamiltonian and number operators are then :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are respectively the position and conjugate momentum operators ( whose role will be played by the field and its conjugate momentum ) and the creation and annihilation operators are defined in the usual way :    @xmath65    satisfying canonical commutation relations @xmath66=\\hat{1}$ ] .    in the holomorphic representation @xcite",
    "traces of operators are evaluated in the space of complex analytic functions of one complex variable @xmath67 and creation and annihilation operators act on this space as :    @xmath68    we have included in appendix [ app : holo ] some of the technical details to perform the relevant calculations in this formalism",
    ". in particular , the partition function for any hamiltonian @xmath69 reads , from ( [ tracehol ] ) :    @xmath70    now , if the number operator is approximately conserved , then @xmath71\\simeq 0 $ ] and equation ( [ approx1 ] ) can be recast , by inserting the identity once , as :    @xmath72    this is the key step of the derivation , since it contains our main approximation , which is equivalent to consider only up to two - particle states in the trace ( [ partitionf ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is physically appropriate to describe a dilute regime where elastic collisions dominate and particle number is approximately conserved .",
    "now , the first matrix element in ( [ approx2 ] ) can be calculated directly , using ( [ evol ] ) with @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 :    @xmath76    so that , using ( [ delta ] ) we arrive to :    @xmath77    from this representation of the partition function we define the corresponding generating functional ( in the qm case ) :    @xmath78\\equiv\\int\\frac{\\mathrm{d}z\\ \\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}}{2\\pi i } \\",

    "we will now proceed to the evaluation of @xmath79 $ ] when the hamiltonian is the free one plus the source term , i.e , @xmath81 in ( [ hamil ] ) . then , as usual , by functional derivation we will get the generating functional for the interacting case .",
    "we first separate the normal - ordered part as customarily , i.e , @xmath82 where the first term is the vacuum energy .",
    "therefore , we have :    @xmath83=e^{-\\beta\\omega/2}\\int\\frac{\\mathrm{d}z\\ \\mathrm{d}\\bar{z}}{2\\pi i } \\ \\mathrm{e}^{-\\bar{z}z } \\mathcal{u}_0(ze^{\\beta\\mu},\\bar{z};-i\\beta)\\ ] ]    the function @xmath84 is defined in ( [ unitop ] ) and for the present case , its expression is given in ( [ evol])-([sigma ] ) .",
    "for its evaluation , we have considered , as detailed in appendix [ app : holo ] , the complex time contour showed in fig.[fig : realcontour ] joining the points @xmath85 and @xmath86 with @xmath87 $ ] , which contains the usual real - time and imaginary - time paths of thermal field theory and satisfies the usual requirements for the path integral to be well defined .",
    "i.e. , @xmath88 is monotonically decreasing along the contour @xcite .",
    "the imaginary - time contour runs in a straight line from @xmath89 down to @xmath90 and is denoted as @xmath91 , while the @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the paths used in the real - time formulation ( see below ) .",

    "can follow the same steps as in @xcite for the evaluation of the remaining integral in ( [ genfunfree ] ) .",
    "namely , one goes back to the discretized version of the path - integral ( see appendix [ app : holo ] ) , uses again ( [ multipleint ] ) with the modified @xmath101 matrix and finally takes again the continuum limit .",

    "note that we must restrict to @xmath107 in order that the previous expressions for the partition function are well defined ( see also comments in appendix [ app : therprop ] )",

    "the result ( [ pathmec ] ) for the quantum - mechanical case for @xmath94 is one of our main results .",
    "its importance relies on the fact that we can now easily construct the generating functional in the interacting case , say @xmath110 with @xmath111 the potential , in the usual way , i.e. , by expanding formally in series of @xmath111 and writing every term in the expansion in terms of functional derivatives of @xmath112 $ ] with respect to @xmath80 .",

    "it is valid for any scalar theory , provided one works in the regime where elastic collisions dominate and particle number is approximately conserved .",
    "the propagator @xmath116 appearing in ( [ pathfinal ] ) is the generalization of ( [ proplibreqm ] ) to the qft case when @xmath117 , the particle energy , and therefore we will restrict in the following to @xmath118 .",
    "recall that the qft generalization of @xmath119 in ( [ betatildedef ] ) is @xmath120 in ( [ betatilde ] ) .",
    "the explicit expression of the propagator coincides , as it should , with the free two - point function ( [ freeprop])-([g < ] ) derived in appendix [ app : therprop ] directly within the canonical formalism at @xmath94 for @xmath121 . in this sense",
    ", one could somehow expect that the generalization to @xmath94 of the generating functional is the one given in ( [ pathfinal ] ) , although there was no rigorous proof available in the literature .",
    "we insist that the usual field - theory derivation for the case of an exactly conserved charge is not applicable here .",
    "next , we will discuss the feynman rules needed for diagrammatic calculations .",
    "the @xmath94 case for approximate particle conservation is essentially a nonequilibrium situation , as commented several times before and thus it presents many subtleties to be borne in mind .",
    "one of them is the impossibility of defining properly a matsubara or imaginary - time formalism , which is related to the way in which the kms conditions are broken .",
    "we will separate this discussion from the real - time case , where a suitable formulation is possible , at least to the order we are considering here .",
    "the imaginary time formalism ( itf ) corresponds to the choice @xmath122 for the contour in fig.[fig : realcontour ] so that one is left only with purely imaginary times @xmath123 with @xmath124 $ ] . at @xmath125 ,",
    "this formalism is usually best suited to deal with thermodynamic quantities such as the free energy , while retarded green functions can be derived from it by analytic continuation in the external frequencies @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath94 propagator shows a distinctive feature that complicates diagrammatic calculations , generating in some cases ill - defined results .",
    "the origin of the problem is the way in which the standard equilibrium kms periodicity conditions are broken .",
    "as explained in appendix [ app : therprop ] , to which we refer for notation , in our case ( particle number conservation valid both for neutral and charged bosons ) we have , in the mixed representation of the propagator , @xmath126 instead of the familiar kms condition @xmath127 .",
    "this momentum - dependent periodic condition makes it impossible to define properly a matsubara representation in fourier space , which can only be done for @xmath128 $ ] , e.g. eq.([matsu ] ) , instead of the required @xmath129 $ ] interval where time differences appearing in propagators are evaluated ( note that @xmath130 ) . as explained in appendix b , this departure of the standard equilibrium kms condition in the particle number case is crucially different from that of a chemical potential associated to a exact charge conservation , like the electric charge for charged particles . in the charge case ,",
    "the departure of kms is given by the constant @xmath131-dependent multiplicative factor in ( [ kmscharg ] ) and , as explained in the appendix , there is no obstruction to define the matsubara representation for @xmath132 $ ] in that case , e.g. eq.([chargedmats ] ) , which amounts just to a shift in the matsubara frequencies .    turning again to the case analyzed in this paper ,",
    "the kms - breaking mentioned in the above paragraph may be a problem for instance in diagrams contributing to the partition function ( closed diagrams ) whenever there is momentum exchange ( time propagation ) inside the diagram , i.e , more than one interaction vertex , since in that case the imaginary - time variables running in the internal propagators lie in the interval @xmath129 $ ] while those propagators are only @xmath133-periodic .",
    "when there is just one interaction vertex , time integration factorizes trivially and the answer is proportional to powers of the tadpole - like contribution @xmath134 given in appendix [ app : therprop ] .",
    "that will be the case for all the contributions to leading order @xmath135 in the calculation of the chpt partition function .",
    "the diagrams that contribute are given in fig.[fig : diagsgl ] ( see section [ sec : evalz ] ) .",
    "however , consider for instance the diagram labeled 8b in fig.[fig : diagsgl ] , contributing to the chpt free energy density to @xmath136 .",
    "taking for simplicity constant vertices , as in the case of @xmath137 , this diagram in the itf would be proportional to :    @xmath138    with @xmath139 given in eqs.([tadpole])-([g1tilde ] ) .",
    "now , as commented above , we can not just replace the fourier representation for @xmath140 in ( [ matsu ] ) since it is only defined for the @xmath141 $ ] interval .",
    "this obstruction produces additional unnatural terms .",
    "the appearance of those terms can be seen by using the mixed representation for @xmath142 in terms of @xmath143 and @xmath144 given in ( [ g>])-([g < ] ) and performing explicitly the @xmath145 integrals in ( [ itz8b ] ) .",
    "we get :    @xmath146 ^ 2\\left[e^{2\\beta\\mu}-1\\right ] \\left[\\tilde{n}_p(e_p)\\right]^2\\left[e^{-2\\beta\\mu}-1\\right]\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath147 .",
    "the first term above gives the standard result for @xmath125 with the replacement of the distribution function @xmath148 , as one would expect from kinetic theory arguments , while this property does not hold for the additional terms .",
    "the remaining contributions vanish for @xmath125 but they do not do so in the @xmath149 limit where they diverge .",
    "this contradicts the natural physical expectation that in the @xmath149 limit and for @xmath150 , the free energy should reduce to the vacuum contribution .    a related conflict arises when trying to calculate correlation functions in the itf .",
    "the loss of kms @xmath99-periodicity implies that the dependence on external times is not only through time - differences .",
    "in particular , this means that correlators depend on @xmath85 .",
    "consider for instance the tadpole - like contribution ( we omit the spatial dependence for simplicity ) :    @xmath151    where @xmath152 . now",
    ", if we make @xmath153 , the change of variable @xmath154 in the third integral does not cancel the second one due to the loss of @xmath99-periodicity of @xmath155 .",
    "therefore , the result does not depend only on @xmath156 but on @xmath157 , i.e. , depends on @xmath158 and @xmath159 independently and , as a consequence , the dependence on @xmath85 does not vanish .    as we will see in sections [ sec : evalz ] and",
    "[ sec : pimasswidth ] , terms of the type showed above appear in the self - energy to leading order and in the partition function at order @xmath136 . in the latter case",
    ", our approximation reaches its validity limit , since particle - changing processes start playing an important role . however , precisely for that reason , at the temperatures where the @xmath136 needs to be included we may consider in practice @xmath160 for these contributions . recall that in fact , the conflictive terms in ( [ iprob ] ) are @xmath161 so that we will be introducing only small corrections by neglecting them .",
    "the presence of those unnatural terms in the itf may be also understood if we note that we are facing a nonequilibrium situation , where the itf is not appropriate and which must be formulated using a contour including real times @xcite .",
    "we will indeed see next that one can define a suitable real - time formalism ( rtf ) so that these problems are not present , at least to the order we consider here , and one can calculate properly not only thermal correlators but also vacuum diagrams contributing to the free energy .",
    "we consider now the full contour in fig.[fig : realcontour ] and , following the standard notation , we denote by @xmath162 with @xmath163 .",
    "we then have for the @xmath164 parts of the contour ( we omit the spatial dependence for simplicity ) :    @xmath165    where @xmath166 and @xmath167 given in ( [ g>])-([g < ] ) and so on for the remaining components .    in order to formulate properly the rtf at @xmath94 we take first , as customary , @xmath168 .",
    "this is necessary if we want to calculate green functions with arbitrary real time arguments . in principle",
    ", this choice implies also that , imposing vanishing asymptotic conditions for the @xmath80 currents and for the spectral function , which hold also in our case , the generating functional for @xmath169 can be factorized as @xcite :    @xmath170=\\mathcal{n}\\ \\tilde{z}_{\\beta , c_{12}}^{\\mathcal{v}= 0}[j]\\ \\tilde{z}_{\\beta , c_{34}}^{\\mathcal{v}= 0}[j]\\ , \\ ] ]    so that one could calculate real - time correlation functions without worrying about the imaginary - leg contributions .",
    "however , as it was pointed out in @xcite , there are imaginary - time contributions that still survive in particular diagrams , for instance self - energy insertions , which indeed we will calculate here .",
    "nevertheless , there is a standard rule for collecting all the relevant contributions but using only the propagators in @xmath164 , the so called @xmath171-prescription @xcite .",
    "this prescription amounts to use in fourier space @xmath172 instead of the seemingly equivalent @xmath173 when multiplied by the on - shell @xmath174-function , as in ( [ tildegp0 ] ) .",
    "for instance , with this prescription one obtains that a simple constant tadpole - like insertion in the self energy such as the diagram showed in fig.[fig : selfenergy]a with a constant vertex , amounts to a redefinition of the mass , as expected .",
    "it also guarantees that there are no ill - defined contributions , such as products of @xmath174 distributions at the same point which in principle could appear when multiplying the rtf propagators .",
    "what we will show here is that for @xmath94 there is also a natural prescription which works , now in terms of @xmath175 , leading to the same properties at the order considered here .",
    "however , it must be pointed out that to higher orders , there may be additional ill - defined terms arising from a nonequilibrium distribution @xcite .",
    "our rtf avoids the main obstruction that we faced in the itf , since the length @xmath99 of the imaginary leg disappears from the integration limits in momentum space , whose fourier representation is well defined now .",
    "moreover , we also choose @xmath176 .",
    "therefore , for green functions with real - time arguments for which we neglect ( with the above prescription ) the @xmath177 parts , we end up with a keldysh - like contour characteristic of nonequilibrium thermal field theory @xcite . with this procedure we will see that an additional property holds : most results can be written as functionals of @xmath178 , which encodes all the @xmath179 dependence .",
    "this is also a expected property from kinetic theory arguments , at least for the leading order corrections in @xmath180 ( dilute gas regime ) .",
    "this allows then to calculate properly any real - time correlation function directly , i.e. , without appealing to the analytic continuation from the itf , which is cumbersome for @xmath94 .",
    "in addition , as we will see below , one can also obtain information about the free energy density without using the itf .",
    "let us then write the propagators ( [ rtpropprev ] ) in momentum space for our choice of contour ( note that the @xmath181 component corresponds to the free propagator @xmath116 in ( [ tildegp0 ] ) ) :    @xmath182\\nonumber\\\\ \\tilde d_{21}(p_0,p)&= & 2\\pi\\delta(p_0 ^ 2-e_p^2)\\left[\\theta(p_0)+n(\\vert p_0 \\vert-\\mu)\\right ] \\label{rtpropmom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the above propagators , we have chosen , as discussed above , the @xmath171 prescription ensuring that the distribution function does not depend explicitly on @xmath183 , as in the @xmath125 case .",
    "we will see below that this yields the same expected properties as for @xmath125 .",
    "it can also be readily checked that our @xmath94 rtf propagators above coincide with those given in @xcite , obtained assuming a direct replacement of the distribution function by the @xmath184 nonequilibrium one .",
    "in fact , the free propagators ( [ rtpropmom ] ) can be readily recast into the general nonequilibrium keldysh form , given for instance in @xcite by taking for the nonequilibrium distribution function our @xmath185 given in ( [ ntildedef])-([betatilde ] ) and @xmath186 components are reversed with respect to ours . ] , which satisfies the property ( [ disfunprop ] ) , as required for general nonequilibrium derivations @xcite .    to provide a particularly relevant example of our previous statements ,",
    "let us consider the tadpole - like correction to the self - energy given by the diagram in fig.[fig : selfenergy]a with a constant vertex ( the generalization to derivative vertices appearing in chpt calculations will be straightforward ) .",
    "the external leg is fixed to be of  type 1 \" , since we are calculating the two - point function with real arguments , i.e , the first - order correction to @xmath187 .",
    "then , if we consider only the @xmath164 contributions , this diagram gives in position space :    @xmath188    note that correlators depend only on space and time differences in the rtf , so that the problems discussed in the previous section , related to the itf version of the tadpole in eq.([ittadpole ] ) are not present now .",
    "now , we take into account that @xmath189 in ( [ tadpole])-([g1tilde ] ) .",
    "then , the fourier transform of @xmath190 is :    @xmath191\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we replace in the above equation the propagators in ( [ rtpropmom ] ) and use @xmath192 where as customary we keep the regulator in the definition of @xmath193 .",
    "thus , we can write :    @xmath194 ^ 2 - 2\\pi i n(\\vert p_0 \\vert-\\mu)\\delta'(p_0 ^ 2-e_p^2)\\right\\ } = -\\tilde g(0)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial m^2 } \\tilde d_{11}(p_0,p )         \\label{tadpolert }          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that it is in the last step in the previous equation where it is crucial to use the @xmath195 prescription chosen above since @xmath196 is independent of @xmath197 .",
    "therefore , the result ( [ tadpolert ] ) implies that the only modification in the @xmath181 propagator is @xmath198 , which is the expected result of mass renormalization which in addition is obtained from the @xmath125 case by replacing @xmath148 in the ( finite ) thermal correction to the tadpole diagram given by the function @xmath199 in ( [ g1tilde ] ) .",
    "note that to this order and with this prescription we have been able to get rid of the ill - defined @xmath200 terms .",
    "however , this prescription might not be enough when higher orders are included , since it has been shown in @xcite for a @xmath201 theory that additional nonequilibrium ill - defined terms arise , which should be properly regulated with a nonzero particle width . at the order corresponding to our previous result ( [ tadpolert ] ) we coincide with @xcite .",
    "we will comment more about this issue in section [ sec : pimasswidth ] .",
    "two more important remarks are in order .",
    "the first one is that the spectral properties of the interacting theory are really defined from retarded green functions , not from time - ordered ones . from the itf , retarded correlators are defined directly by analytic continuation .",
    "however , we have seen that this is not a well defined procedure for @xmath94 .",
    "the solution of the problem of finding retarded green functions from the rtf time - ordered product was given in @xcite .",
    "in that work , a set of rules ( so - called circling rules ) were provided in order to define a function that has the required causal retarded properties , namely that satisfies that one of the outgoing lines of the corresponding diagram has the largest time component .",
    "it was then shown in several examples that this function coincides with the analytic continuation of the itf correlator .",
    "now , it can be checked that the same properties of the free propagators used in @xcite for the derivation of the circling rules hold for our @xmath202 propagators and therefore the same rules lead to the rtf retarded function at @xmath94 .",
    "the application of those rules is trivial for the tadpole case discussed above , since there is only one vertex .",
    "however , they will be of use for the case of higher order contributions to the self energy which we will consider below , like the thermal width arising from diagram [ fig : selfenergy]b .",
    "the second remark has to do with the calculation of thermodynamic quantities within the rtf , i.e. , the partition function or the free energy density . in principle , due to the factorization of the imaginary - leg commented above , the contribution to vacuum graphs when summing over fields of type 1 and 2 vanishes identically . however , it was shown in @xcite that fixing one of the vertices of a vacuum diagram to be  external \" of type 1 and summing over the remaining internal vertices with an overall @xmath99 factor reproduces the free - energy result and for @xmath125 coincides with the itf .",
    "the functional arguments used in those papers are also applicable to our @xmath94 case and in fact , the direct use of that prescription leads to the expected answers .",
    "let us show this for the case of the @xmath136 diagram 8b in fig.[fig : diagsgl ] , analyzed in section [ sec : itfor ] in the itf . applying the previous prescription and with constant vertices , we get that this diagram is now proportional to :    @xmath203    with @xmath190 in ( [ deff ] ) .",
    "we then see that we arrive to the itf result ( [ iprob ] ) but without the additional terms discussed in that section , since the proportionality factors between this diagram and ( [ rtz8b ] ) or ( [ itz8b ] ) come only from combinatorics and are therefore identical .",
    "we will use this real - time prescription to define properly our free energy .",

    "the crucial point is that none of the @xmath135 vacuum closed diagrams in fig.[fig : diagsgl ] can be obtained from the lowest order inelastic diagrams in fig.[fig:2pito4pi]a,[fig:2pito4pi]b .",
    "this distinctive feature can be interpreted as a way to identify the validity range of our approximation .",

    "this approximation simplifies considerably the renormalization of this graph , since now we can follow the same steps as in @xcite .",

    "the finite part of the @xmath284 integrals can be evaluated numerically .",
    "a crucial point is that this approximation is consistent , as far as renormalization is concerned , with our previous evaluation of the @xmath285 diagrams since the divergent parts of the terms proportional to @xmath286 and @xmath287 arising from the @xmath284 integrals cancel exactly with those coming from the other four diagrams , while the terms proportional to @xmath249 add together to renormalize the physical pion mass according to the definition    @xmath288    in addition , as it happens for @xmath15 , this ensures that neither the tree level constants from @xmath289 nor the @xmath290 independent renormalization constants needed to render @xmath284 finite appear in the final expression for the free energy once it is expressed in terms of @xmath251 .",
    "we remark that with our representation , not only the renormalization procedure is consistent , but the final answer for the full @xmath136 contribution amounts to replace @xmath291 in all the spatial momentum integrals , without dealing with unnatural terms , like those discussed in section [ sec : formal ] .",

    "we plot our results in fig.[fig : resultsther ] .",
    "the first feature we observe is that the @xmath135 and the ideal gas curves are very close to one another for all the range of temperatures and chemical potentials showed .",
    "sizable differences due to the interactions only show up numerically when including the @xmath136 .",
    "this is a also a feature of the @xmath15 calculation @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the chiral limit ( @xmath294 ) and for @xmath15 , the @xmath135 in ( [ z6 ] ) vanishes identically , while the @xmath136 survives , producing conformally anomalous contributions to the pressure @xcite . in fig.[fig : resultsther ] we also compare our results with the virial gas approach @xcite , where the pressure can be written at low pion density in terms of the pion scattering phase shifts . in the curves showed in fig.[fig : resultsther ] , the phase shifts have been calculated perturbatively to @xmath295 in chpt and using the same set of low - energy constants that for our perturbative results with the approach of the present paper .",
    "we see that our @xmath136 results with @xmath2 lie reasonably close to the virial result , at least for not very high @xmath1 .",
    "this is a good consistency check of our present approach .",
    "another general feature that we observe in the curves is that the effect of the pion chemical potential is always to increase thermal effects .",
    "effectively , it acts as similarly as a reduction of the effective pion mass ( this is more accurate for @xmath296 where the typical momenta in the distribution functions are @xmath297 ) and therefore for fixed @xmath35 , the results for increasing @xmath1 go qualitatively in the same direction as for increasing @xmath35 with @xmath15 .",
    "for instance , we see that the pressure increases for increasing @xmath1 and approaches faster with @xmath35 the asymptotic limit @xmath298 @xcite expected in the chiral limit ( @xmath299 ) .",
    "the effect of interactions is also to increase the pressure , producing additive contributions in the chpt expansion .",
    "the curves for the quark condensate show that the chiral restoration temperature goes down for @xmath2 .",
    "this is also a consequence of the above discussed qualitative behavior , since the system for @xmath2 is closer to chiral restoration .",
    "with the numerical values we get , we see that if chemical freeze - out takes place for temperatures below the chiral phase transition , then we do not expect to see any change in the value of @xmath8 . on the contrary",
    "if @xmath300 ( which is less likely with the available experimental information ) we would expect a reduction in @xmath8 compared with the estimates taking @xmath15 .",
    "it becomes clear from our discussion in section [ sec : motivation ] that incorporating additional physical requirements allowing to describe @xmath36 is crucial in our approach , in order to be consistent with the chemical nonequilibrium evolution . in this sense ,",
    "a very interesting observable is the ratio of entropy density to pion density , also plotted in fig.[fig : resultsther ] .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that on general grounds one expects this ratio to remain almost constant during the expansion .",
    "this is the isentropic expansion approximation , which is exact in the high @xmath35 limit @xmath299 for the ideal gas .",
    "we remark that we are restricting here to the gas of pions .",
    "if heavier degrees of freedom are included , such as the @xmath301 , one has to account for the total number of pions @xmath302 which includes those  stored \" in the @xmath301 if the channel @xmath303 is considered as the only source of pion number changing , and similarly with other resonances ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "the idea is then that by fixing @xmath38 to a given value at the chemical freeze out temperature @xmath304 where @xmath15 , going down in the temperature scale one can keep @xmath38 fixed by increasing @xmath1 , as it can be seen in fig.[fig : resultsther ] .",
    "this provides the isentropic dependence @xmath9 , which is given in @xcite in the ideal gas approximation .",

    "the most significant effect we observe is the reduction of @xmath304 when @xmath136 or virial interactions are included .",
    "this is a very natural effect since , as we have discussed in previous sections , that order in the interaction is the one where particle - changing processes begin to be relevant and drive the system back to chemical equilibration .",
    "the virial curve lies reasonably close to our perturbative @xmath136 since the two approaches differ significantly only for rather high values of @xmath1 and @xmath35 , which are not reached along the curve @xmath36 .",
    "in fact , in the isentropic evolution our @xmath136 approach is better justified since @xmath307 .",
    "we also remark that the same effect of faster equilibration is seen when comparing the curves of the ideal pion gas with that of the ideal pion+resonances gas , as done in @xcite .",
    "one can check that the curves in that paper for @xmath38 as a function of @xmath35 for different @xmath1 are systematically lower when including resonances , as in our case in fig.[fig : resultsther ] when including the @xmath136 or in the virial case and therefore the free pion and resonance gas equilibrates faster , which is the feature that we are able to reproduce here including higher order pion interactions .",

    "it is important to remark that when nonequilibrium distributions are considered , as it is our case here , it has been pointed out that additional @xmath200-like or pinching - pole ill - defined contributions arise @xcite , which should be regularized keeping a nonzero particle width .",

    "one can then follow similar steps as in the standard derivation of the thermal corrections to the pion self - energy to this order @xcite , the wave function renormalization being directly related to the thermal @xmath256 through the usual definition in terms of the residue of the axial - axial current correlator .",

    "a very interesting point is that it admits a natural extension @xcite by considering ( in the dilute gas regime ) not only the perturbative tree - level @xmath320 amplitude , but also higher orders , including unitarized amplitudes . in the latter case",

    "this set is adequate to compare with the perturbative chpt expressions , although it does not give the best results for the mass and width of the resonances generated with the iam .",

    "our results show that the leading order , the chpt @xmath320 given by the tadpole diagram in fig.[fig : selfenergy]a , produces a thermal mass slightly increasing with temperature and chemical potential .",
    "however , including the @xmath295 or unitarized corrections to the amplitude , the mass tends to decrease significantly with @xmath35 and @xmath1 .",
    "our results at @xmath15 agree with @xcite .",
    "the difference between the @xmath295 and the unitarized curve is not very relevant here .",
    "our @xmath320 curve agrees reasonably with a linear - sigma model calculation @xcite which agrees with chpt to this order at @xmath15 and where the chemical potential is introduced in analogy with the charged scalar field case .",
    "these results suggest an interesting scenario : the pion system could undergo bose - einstein ( be ) condensation driven by the dropping of the thermal mass by interactions .",
    "recall that we are dealing with be condensation of both neutral and charged pions , since we are considering an electrically neutral system with finite pion density .",
    "the physical situation is then different from the charged pion or kaon condensation taking place in nuclear matter @xcite or isospin chemical potential @xcite scenarios , although the dropping of the effective mass takes place also in the former .",
    "be condensation for pion number and its possible phenomenological consequences in heavy ion collisions has been extensively studied in the literature @xcite . among the observable consequences",
    "are the anomalous enhancement of the low-@xmath338 pion spectrum and of number fluctuations in high multiplicity events .    in our grand - canonical interacting framework",
    "we can describe the corrections to be condensation due to pion interactions . in the standard free case , the be limit",
    "is reached when @xmath339 from below ( by definition the system is below the condensed phase ) .",
    "those values for the pion chemical potential seem too high compared with those measured in heavy ion collisions at thermal freeze out @xmath4 100 mev @xcite . in other words , the required pion densities for be condensation might not be reached .",
    "however , if the effective particle mass @xmath340 drops by interactions among the medium constituents , the value @xmath341 would be reduced .",

    "those curves correspond to the @xmath295 amplitudes , both for the thermal mass and for @xmath333 and @xmath343 ( in the virial approach ) . in fig.[fig : be ] ( right ) we show also the density - temperature curves corresponding to @xmath344 for different orders in the interaction .",

    "we also show the curve corresponding to the be limit by lowering of the mass , as we have just explained , for the same virial approach , which produces a considerable lowering of the required densities . in any case , the corrections due to interactions are small near thermal freeze - out .",
    "we also remark that some of our previous results , including those regarding be condensation by mass reduction , rely on the validity of the dilute gas regime , for instance when using ( [ luschermass ] ) , but corrections might be important for temperatures close to the chiral transition or chemical potentials close to @xmath251 .        finally , we turn to the calculation of the leading order imaginary part of the pion self - energy , given in chpt by the diagram in fig.[fig : selfenergy]b .",
    "this is the leading order contribution to the thermal collisional width @xmath345 with @xmath346 and @xmath347 the retarded self - energy , which defines the dispersion relation @xmath348 .    as we have commented in section [ sec : rtfor ] , we will evaluate the retarded correlator in the real - time formalism , following the circling rules in @xcite , which also apply to the @xmath2 case . applying those rules to diagram [ fig : selfenergy]b we have :    @xmath349=-\\frac{i}{2}\\left[\\sigma_{21}(p_0,{\\vert \\vec{p } \\vert})-\\sigma_{12}(p_0,{\\vert \\vec{p } \\vert})\\right]\\ ] ]    where @xmath350 are obtained by using for the three internal lines in the diagram the @xmath351 rtf propagators . with the usual rt self - energy definition @xcite and our convention for the @xmath352 , @xmath186 propagators given in section [ sec : rtfor ]",

    "the natural expectation from replacing just the distribution function @xmath363 for @xmath2 would be then @xmath364 in that factor , as well as the modifications of the internal distribution functions @xmath365 where @xmath366 is short for @xmath367 .",
    "this is indeed the result found in @xcite derived from kinetic theory . in our case , it is not obvious that the answer is the same , since the function @xmath255 above is not equal to one for the eight possible combinations of signs of the three internal @xmath368 .",
    "we denote them by @xmath369 , with @xmath370 .",
    "now , we take into account that the @xmath174 functions in each of the internal lines put them on - shell , i.e. , @xmath371 and global energy - momentum conservation in the diagram imposed by the @xmath174-functions in ( [ therwidthpre ] ) .",
    "thus , the combination @xmath372 giving @xmath373 is excluded by energy conservation @xmath374 . on the other hand , from three - momentum conservation and the on - shell conditions we have that for any combination it should hold @xmath375 where we denote @xmath376 and @xmath377 and , in addition @xmath378 with @xmath379 and where @xmath380 , @xmath381 are short for @xmath382 and @xmath383 respectively . therefore , the case @xmath384 ( @xmath385 ) is also excluded , since for that combination @xmath386",

    "it is not difficult to repeat the above analysis , now with the external energy @xmath397 . in that case",
    ", every combination of relative signs between the @xmath366 is obtained from the previous case by flipping the three @xmath398 , the @xmath399 functions being independent of the sign of @xmath400 .",
    "thus , applying the same arguments , the only surviving combinations are now @xmath391 , @xmath388 and @xmath384 , the three of them giving @xmath385",
    ". therefore , what we have proven in terms of the @xmath401 and @xmath402 components of the self - energy for this diagram is :    @xmath403    which is the usual equilibrium relation with @xmath404 .",
    "this relation will be of use in the discussion at the end of this section about possible higher order corrections related to pinching poles .    in conclusion ,",
    "the result ( [ therwidthpre ] ) we find with our diagrammatic method is the same as in kinetic theory @xcite , which , after relabeling @xmath405 in @xmath394 and @xmath406 in @xmath395 and performing the three integrals in @xmath368 using the on - shell @xmath174-functions , can be written as :    @xmath407\\left[1+n(e_3-\\mu_\\pi)\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\&\\times&\\vert t_{\\pi\\pi}(s , t)\\vert^2 ( 2\\pi)^4\\delta(e_p+e_1-e_2-e_3)\\delta^{(3)}(\\vec{p}+\\vec{k}_1-\\vec{k}_2-\\vec{k}_3 ) \\label{therwidthfull}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath408 is the isospin averaged elastic pion scattering amplitude with @xmath409 , @xmath410 .",
    "taking now the dilute gas regime in the previous expression , which amounts to neglect all the bose - einstein functions @xmath411 except @xmath412 , gives rise to the extension of luscher s formula in terms of the forward scattering amplitude , as in ( [ luschermass ] ) but now for the imaginary part of the self - energy through the pion thermal width ( which vanishes at @xmath234 ) :    @xmath413    where we have relabeled @xmath414 and @xmath415 is the total @xmath23 cross section    @xmath416    where the last line is the optical theorem , following from exact unitarity ( [ unit ] ) .",
    "we remark that our final results both for the real and imaginary parts of the self - energy to this order correspond to the replacement @xmath417 evaluated at positive energies .",
    "this is not only natural from the kinetic theory viewpoint but it is also formally obtained by performing such replacement in the analytically continued @xmath15 itf self - energies .",
    "the thermal width is of phenomenological relevance , since it enters directly in the calculation of transport coefficients in the meson gas @xcite .",
    "it is then important to estimate pion chemical potential effects in the width during the phase of chemical nonequilibrium where particle number is approximately conserved and transport phenomena can be described relying on the dominance of elastic collisions , which is also consistent with the dilute gas regime . on the other hand , in this regime the mean collision time defined for ultrarelativistic particles as @xmath418 @xcite with the averaged width :    @xmath419    provides direct information about thermal relaxation .",
    "we represent @xmath420 in the dilute approach in fig.[fig : tau ] , using the scattering amplitude in ( [ gammadg ] ) to different orders , including the unitarized case .",
    "we use the same set of @xmath336 constants as in the rest of the paper .",
    "we see in the figure that the effects of reproducing correctly the energy behavior of the scattering amplitude is important for evaluating the collision time .",
    "in particular , the unitarized curve shows important differences with the perturbative ones in the temperature range showed .",
    "this was also noticed in @xcite at @xmath15 and the importance of including unitarized corrections to the width for transport coefficients in the meson gas has been highlighted in @xcite for instance regarding violations of ads / cft bounds for the shear viscosity over entropy ratio or correlations between the bulk viscosity and the conformal anomaly .",
    "another clear effect that we observe is the reduction of the mean time with the pion chemical potential , also observed in @xcite with @xmath320 amplitudes .",
    "physically , in the temperature regime where @xmath420 is much smaller than the typical plasma lifetime ( @xmath421 10 fm / c ) which at the same time is small compared to the inelastic collision time driving the system to chemical equilibrium , the system remains in thermal but not chemical equilibrium . from the estimates of the inelastic collision rates given for instance in @xcite and the results in fig.[fig : tau ]",
    ", this would happen at @xmath15 typically in the range 120 mev@xmath422 180 mev .",
    "however , precisely in that regime , and as we have explained in this paper , @xmath2 , its typical values being given by the isentropic curve in fig.[fig : mut ] , which means that the range of thermal equilibrium enlarges from below , from the commented reduction of @xmath420 with @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , estimating the thermal freeze out temperature @xmath423 as that where this approximation ceases to be valid , i.e. , where @xmath424 10 fm / c ( this type of dynamical condition has been used also in @xcite to determine the freeze - out conditions ) gives a shift in the thermal freeze - out temperature @xmath425 mev with respect to the @xmath15 case , following approximately the isentropic values in fig.[fig : mut ] . in particular , using the unitarized results in fig.[fig : tau ] we obtain in this way @xmath426 95 mev , close to experimental values .",
    "finally , let us comment on the pathological nonequilibrium terms found in @xcite in a @xmath427 context .",
    "those terms are of the type of @xmath200 functions at the same point , or pinching singularities and therefore have to be regularized by keeping a nonzero particle width in the propagators , i.e. , @xmath428 in our case .",
    "the first nonvanishing term of this kind in the @xmath427 theory is the three - loop diagram given in figure 2b of @xcite .",
    "note that formally this is an @xmath429 correction , while the diagrams we have considered here in fig.[fig : selfenergy ] , for which there are no such pathologies , would be @xmath430 and @xmath431 respectively in that counting .",
    "nevertheless , the argument in @xcite is that those contributions are proportional to the inverse width @xmath432 with @xmath433 and therefore could become of the same order as the leading ones .",
    "the form of such leading pinching - pole term @xcite in our case is :    @xmath434\\sigma_{12}^{6b}-\\sigma_{21}^{6b}\\tilde n_p(p_0)\\right\\ } \\label{patho1st}\\ ] ]    where the self - energy components of diagram 6b that we have analyzed above enter directly to this order and @xmath435 denote the retarded / advanced propagators .",
    "let us isolate the leading @xmath436 behaviour of the previous expression .",
    "the product @xmath437 is the characteristic pinching - pole contribution appearing typically in diagrammatic calculations of transport coefficients @xcite and in the @xmath436 behaves as :    @xmath438    which puts on - shell ( @xmath439 ) the integrand of ( [ patho1st ] ) .",
    "now , we recall the relation ( [ perio6b ] ) we have derived for diagram 6b , together with the properties of the  modified \" distribution function , in particular @xmath440 .",
    "altogether , this means that the leading order pathological contribution ( [ patho1st ] ) vanishes in our case in the @xmath436 limit .",
    "there may be higher order corrections of this kind , but in accordance with the power counting in @xcite , those would be subleading with respect to the contributions in fig.[fig : selfenergy ] that we have analyzed in this section .",
    "the previous analysis showing the absence of pathological terms is only valid to lowest order in those terms .",
    "further conclusions can only be reached with a complete chpt analysis of higher order pinching - pole contributions , extending that in @xcite , which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth pointing out that the low-@xmath35 chpt counting does not involve any coupling constant , which implies important differences with respect to the @xmath427 one in the perturbative behaviour of pinching diagrams at low @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the analysis of @xcite shows that the nonequilibrium pathological terms are always proportional to @xmath441 , the deviation from the bose - einstein distribution function .",
    "thus , in our case , we can use an argument similar to the one we invoked in section [ sec : evalz ] when dealing with the @xmath136 terms in the partition function .",
    "namely , that in the chpt counting those diagrams are expected to be important for temperatures for which @xmath442 , giving a further suppression .",
    "we finally remark that in the @xmath2 scenario , the presence of nonvanishing pinching - pole terms have also their origin in the presence of particle - changing processes ( see also our discussion in section [ sec : evalz ] ) .",
    "in fact , self - energy combinations of the form ( [ patho1st ] ) enter directly in the boltzmann equation describing the rate of particle number change @xcite .",
    "the fact that the leading correction of that type ( [ patho1st ] ) vanishes in our case seems to be related to the fact that the leading self - energy corrections arising from the diagrams in fig.[fig : selfenergy ] can always be expressed in terms only of the elastic @xmath23 scattering amplitude , as we have discussed extensively throughout this section .",
    "in this work we have developed a path - integral diagrammatic formalism in order to deal with chemical nonequilibrium effects in interacting scalar field theories , in the regime where particle number is approximately conserved . within the theoretical framework of holomorphic path integrals and thermal field theory , we have derived the relevant feynman rules for nonzero particle number chemical potential @xmath60",
    ", whose validity is restricted to the temperature regimes where one can neglect particle - changing processes .",
    "this derivation in the interacting case is original of this paper , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "we have addressed some subtleties related to the choice of contour in complex times , leading to the extension of real and imaginary time formalisms at @xmath443 .",
    "we have shown that the consistent formulation is the real - time one , in agreement with other nonequilibrium formulations .",
    "the imaginary - time formalism can lead to spurious contributions , related to the loss of periodicity or global kms conditions .",
    "these problems are not present in the real - time formalism , once a proper energy representation for the propagators is chosen , in accordance with the standard @xmath125 choice .",
    "in addition , following previous studies in the literature at @xmath125 , we have been able to construct the combinations of real - time diagrams leading to retarded correlators and to closed diagrams contributing to the free energy .",
    "we have applied this formalism to the case of a pion gas , relevant for relativistic heavy ion collisions between thermal and chemical freeze - out with nonzero pion number chemical potential @xmath36 .",
    "our description is consistent if the @xmath35-dependence of @xmath1 encodes the time evolution of the plasma between those phases .",
    "the relevant diagrammatic scheme for temperatures below chiral restoration is chiral perturbation theory . in this framework , we have calculated the leading corrections to the ideal gas coming from chiral interactions . to leading order @xmath135 the corrections to the pressure",
    "can be expressed in terms of tadpole diagrams and are numerically rather small up to @xmath8 .",
    "to next to leading order @xmath136 , closed diagrams contributing to the free energy can be obtained from particle - changing processes , which signals the onset of the number conservation approximation break - up .",
    "nevertheless , since @xmath1 is small for temperatures where those chpt corrections become important , they can be reliably calculated and produce sizable deviations from the free gas .",
    "the results to that order agree reasonably well with a virial expansion analysis . our results for thermodynamical observables show that both chiral interactions and @xmath1 tend to increase the pressure . the chiral restoration critical temperature decreases with increasing @xmath1 , which would be of relevance only if chiral restoration takes place for lower temperatures than chemical freeze - out .",
    "we have also calculated the isentropic @xmath36 curve for different orders in the interactions .",
    "the corrections to the ideal gas show a significant reduction of the chemical freeze - out temperature , which is the expected effect of interactions , since they increase the probability of producing inelastic processes .",
    "the same effect had been observed previously in a free gas of pions and resonances .",
    "our approach allows to derive thermal corrections to the pion self - energy at @xmath2 , from the leading - order chpt diagrams , both for the real and imaginary parts of the retarded correlator .",
    "the imaginary part comes from a two - loop diagram , for which the use of rtf rules for the construction of the retarded function is crucial . after a detailed evaluation ,",
    "our diagrammatic result is shown to coincide with the expected expressions from kinetic theory arguments .",
    "we have also discussed the role of higher - order pinching pole contributions to self - energies , providing different arguments which support that those corrections are subleading in our approach .",
    "the real part of the self - energy gives the thermal mass , which together with the condensate and the pion decay constant to the same order , satisfy the @xmath2 extension of the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation .",
    "in addition , both the real and imaginary parts satisfy a luscher - like relation in terms of the forward pion scattering amplitude .",
    "this relation allows to calculate in the dilute regime the self - energy corrections for higher orders in the chpt amplitudes , including unitarized expressions which have the physically expected energy behavior and reproduce the lightest resonance states . the results for the thermal mass show a clear decreasing both with @xmath35 and @xmath1 for @xmath295 and unitarized amplitudes .",
    "this suggests the interesting possibility of reaching bose - einstein condensation when the effective thermal mass approaches the chemical potential .",
    "this mechanism would require lower pion densities to reach be condensation .",
    "we have discussed this possibility , which is a purely interacting effect , within the isentropic values and comparing the pion densities with those in the standard approach of considering the ideal gas be limit @xmath444 with @xmath251 the vacuum mass .",

    "the mean time decreases with @xmath35 and @xmath1 for all orders in the interaction , which implies a sizable reduction , compared to the @xmath15 case , of the thermal freeze - out temperature , estimated as that where @xmath420 equals the typical plasma lifetime .",
    "summarizing , the diagrammatic field - theory scheme developed in the present work provides , in our opinion , useful results regarding the chemically non equilibrated phase of the meson gas resulting from a relativistic heavy ion collision . in future works we plan to generalize the analysis presented here to include also the strange sector ( kaons and eta ) as well as to extend previous studies of transport coefficients by including pion chemical potentials along the lines presented here .",

    "we review here some of the key aspects of the holomorphic path integral representation which are used in the main text . we will follow the discussion in @xcite , to which we refer for more details .",
    "we consider the space @xmath445 of complex analytic functions of one complex variable and define the following scalar product : @xmath446 where the bar denotes complex conjugation ( @xmath67 and @xmath447 are treated as independent variables ) , and the notation for the measure means @xmath448 with @xmath449 .",
    "we also define the states @xmath450 in the dual space @xmath451 such that @xmath452 , with @xmath453 .",
    "then , the set @xmath454 , with @xmath455 constitutes an orthonormal basis for @xmath445 with the inner product ( [ scalarprod ] ) .",
    "this implies in particular :    @xmath456    we can also calculate the scalar product : @xmath457 where we will denote the dual of @xmath458 by @xmath459 .",
    "now , from the definition ( [ scalarprod ] ) , the identity operator can be written as : @xmath460 since the functions ( [ basis ] ) constitute an orthonormal basis , we can calculate the trace of an operator as follows : @xmath461 the prescription ( [ aaplusholo ] ) defines a representation of the creation and annihilation operators on @xmath445 .",
    "therefore ,    @xmath462    for the purpose of obtaining a path integral , we need to know how to calculate the matrix elements ( kernels ) of the kind @xmath463 , where @xmath464 is an operator expressed in terms of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "if the operator is expressed in normal - order form ( which we denote by the subscript @xmath465 ) i.e , arranging creation operators to the left and annihilation to the right , the kernels can be written in a particularly useful way , from ( [ actcrean ] ) , as :    @xmath466    in particular , we will need the kernel corresponding to  time - evolution \" :    @xmath467    with @xmath468 the normal - ordered hamiltonian of the system .    for that purpose ,",
    "as customarily , we divide the interval @xmath469 into @xmath343 subintervals of infinitesimal length @xmath470 and we will take the @xmath471 limit in the end .",
    "having in mind the application to thermal field theory , we will take complex times @xmath472 where @xmath100 is the contour starting at @xmath85 and ending at @xmath74 showed in fig.[fig : realcontour ] .",

    "in this appendix we review some important aspects regarding the canonical description of the free theory and the different representations for free propagators in thermal field theory at nonzero chemical potential , paying special attention to the differences between the case of particle number chemical potential and that of exactly conserved charges such as the electric charge for complex scalar fields .",
    "let us consider first the case of a free neutral scalar field @xmath481 . in that case , one can evaluate the partition function and the propagator ( two - point function ) directly in the complete set @xmath482 , corresponding to eigenstates of the hamiltonian operator with @xmath483 particles in the state 1 , @xmath484 particles in the state 2 , and so on : @xmath485 with @xmath486 . for non - interacting bosons of mass @xmath253 , @xmath487 , and the ( infinite ) term @xmath488 is the vacuum energy . as customary ,",
    "we consider first the system in a finite volume @xmath489 , which we will later take to infinity , so that spatial momenta are discretized as @xmath490 with integers @xmath491 and energy levels are labeled by @xmath492 .",
    "the free partition function reads then : @xmath493 where the condition @xmath494 must be satisfied for all @xmath495 .",
    "thus , in the @xmath496 limit :                                                            note that we have used @xmath519 and we have chosen the  @xmath171-prescription \" which , as explained in the main text , guarantees the decoupling of the imaginary - leg contribution to real - time green functions .",
    "the free propagators in ( [ g>])-([g < ] ) can be extended to imaginary times @xmath123 corresponding time differences along the imaginary - time leg @xmath91 in fig.[fig : realcontour ] .",
    "thus , we define @xmath520 for @xmath521 and @xmath522 for @xmath523 .",
    "now , if we try to construct a matsubara frequency representation in this case , we have , from the mixed representation ( [ g > ] ) and using ( [ ntildedef])-([betatilde ] ) :      where the @xmath164 contours are showed in fig.[fig : matsubaracont ] , the black dots on the imaginary axis being the  modified \" matsubara frequencies @xmath525 .",
    "a very important point here is that the last step in the above equation is only valid for @xmath526 $ ] , otherwise the integrals along the circular arcs with @xmath527 do not vanish .",
    "thus , the matsubara fourier representation is only valid in that interval , which is smaller than @xmath528 $ ] .    carrying out the same procedure with @xmath529 using ( [ g < ] ) leads to the same  modified \" matsubara representation for @xmath530 $ ] .",
    "in fact , we see that the kms - like condition ( [ periodc ] ) translates into the imaginary - time propagator as :          at this point , it is instructive to compare the above free propagators for chemical nonequilibrium with those obtained when an exact conserved charge is present .",
    "as we are going to see , there are crucial differences between the two cases . for definiteness",
    ", we consider the electric charge for the case of a complex scalar field and denote the corresponding chemical potential by @xmath131 . in that case , the counterparts of ( [ g>])-([g <",
    "] ) for the free propagator @xmath532 are @xcite :      note that , unlike our previous case in ( [ g>])-([g < ] ) , the chemical potential enters now with _ opposite _",
    "sign for the positive and negative frequencies , which comes from the opposite charge of particles and antiparticles , necessary to maintain the chemical equilibrium imposed by charge conservation . due to this sign difference ,",
    "the above propagator satisfies now the following condition :      i.e , in this case the kms symmetry realizes simply as a modification of the @xmath40 kms boundary condition by a constant @xmath131-dependent factor , which is a result completely different from the previous case , c.f .",
    ", eq.([periodc ] ) , where the loss of kms involves the @xmath381-dependent @xmath120 , which _ can not _ be rewritten as a multiplicative factor :      another way to arrive to the same conclusion is to derive directly the periodicity relation from the thermal averages . in the charged scalar case ,",
    "it is crucial to use that the field is a charge eigenstate , i.e. @xmath536=-\\hat\\phi$ ] , @xmath537=\\hat\\phi^\\dagger$ ] @xcite .",
    "this , together with charge conservation @xmath538=0 $ ] leads to :                where @xmath544 correspond to the contours in fig.[fig : matsubaracont ] but with the vertical line displaced to @xmath545 ( @xmath546 ) and the dots in that line being now the standard matsubara frequencies @xmath547 .",
    "therefore , in this case the ordinary it formalism is recovered for @xmath132 $ ] simply by changing in the feynman rules @xmath548 .",
    "most of the results showed in the main text can be written in terms of the above thermal propagators evaluated at the origin in position space and functions related to them . from ( [ gmixdef])-([g < ] )",
