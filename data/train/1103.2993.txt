    "tau leptons are heavy enough that their decay products can contain an on - shell spin-2 tensor meson , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 will denote the lowest lying pseudoscalar , vector , axial and tensor mesons , respectively . ]",
    "( @xmath9 , see @xcite ) in the final state .",
    "therefore , the @xmath10 decays can provide a unique environment to study the weak - tensor - pseudoscalar vertex in the moderate energy regime .",
    "measurements of these hadronic matrix elements will be complementary to the ones involved in the crossed related @xmath11 weak transitions which are accessible only in the decays of heavy @xmath12 and @xmath13 mesons .",
    "the hadronic matrix elements @xmath14 , which are important in the calculation of semileptonic @xmath15 and non - leptonic @xmath16 or @xmath17 decays , have been calculated in the framework of several effective models of qcd @xcite .",
    "manifestly , semileptonic decays provide a cleaner environment to study the weak @xmath18 vertex owing to an exact factorization of the decay amplitude , while the non - leptonic amplitudes receive contributions from different terms of the effective weak hamiltonian and a factorization approximation is usually assumed in some calculations ( for an extensive literature on the subject see @xcite ) . from the experimental side , a few measurements or upper limits about some of these @xmath13 meson decay channels have been reported so far by @xmath13-factory experiments ( results are listed in @xcite ) and a proper account of the measured rates is still the subject of current investigations .",
    "conversely , tensor mesons produced in @xmath2 lepton decays have been scarcely investigated at the theoretical level and , from the experimental point of view , only the upper limit @xmath19 has been reported in @xcite .",
    "as it was discussed in @xcite , if it was observed , this decay mode would require the existence of exotic tensor charged weak currents .",
    "as is well known , measurements of @xmath20 decays involving two or more pseudoscalar mesons have shown the presence of several intermediate resonant states which populate the different hadronic invariant - mass spectra @xcite .",
    "indeed , these hadronic spectra have been useful to determine the properties of @xmath21 and @xmath22 resonances in a clean environment ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "recently , both babar and belle collaborations have reported refined measurements of @xmath2 decays into three pseudoscalar mesons which include either pions and/or kaons @xcite . since tensor mesons undergo sizable decay rates to two pseudoscalar mesons in a @xmath23-wave orbital configuration @xcite",
    ", one may expect that @xmath8 mesons give a contribution to three - pseudoscalar @xmath2 lepton decays via the @xmath24 decay chain ; eventually , we would be able to extract the @xmath10 rates from the relevant hadronic spectra as it was done recently to extract the branching fractions for the @xmath25 @xcite decay modes from data on the three - pseudoscalar channels of tau decays .    in this paper",
    "we study the @xmath26 channels that are kinematically allowed in @xmath2 lepton decays .",
    "most of the popular effective models of qcd at low energies do not make predictions for the weak @xmath18 vertex in the energy region relevant for @xmath2 decays .",
    "here we use a meson dominance model where the weak and strong coupling constants are determined from other independent decay processes ( see for example @xcite for an application to @xmath27 decays ) .",
    "we find that the branching fractions for the @xmath28 channels under study are of the order of @xmath29 and therefore , intermediate tensor resonances give a small contribution to the rates of three - pseudoscalar final states .",
    "eventually , the large data sample of @xmath30 pairs accumulated by @xmath13-factory experiments would allow to extract the rates of tensor mesons produced in @xmath2 lepton decays .",

    "@xcite , which considers that the dominant contribution arises from the @xmath102 coupling ) .",
    "we assume isospin symmetry to relate the strong coupling constants for different charge states in a given channel , and su(3 ) flavor symmetry to relate the couplings of vertices that can not be measured directly to the ones that are extracted from measured rates . using these approximations and the measured rates @xcite of relevant decays , we obtain the following central values : @xmath103 gev@xmath104 , @xmath105 gev@xmath106 @xmath107 gev@xmath104 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 @xmath112gev@xmath113 gev@xmath114 gev@xmath115 , @xmath116 gev@xmath115 , and @xmath117 gev@xmath104 . in order to get some of the couplings involving the strange axial mesons @xcite we have assumed a value of @xmath118 @xcite for the mixing angle of the @xmath119 and @xmath96 strange mesons .",
    "we also note that the value of the @xmath120 coupling given above agrees with the prediction obtained in the appendix of the first paper in ref .",
    "we note that the uncertainties associated to these couplings are estimated directly from their measured masses and rates or , when data was not available , they were attributed a conservative @xmath121 uncertainty if su(3 ) symmetry was assumed in their derivation .",
    "finally , the values of other relevant inputs to determine the branching ratios of tau decays have been taken from ref .",
    "in addition we have set the weak coupling of hadron @xmath122 from @xmath123 decays : @xmath124 mev , @xmath125 mev , @xmath126 mev , and @xmath127 mev .",
    "on the other hand , we use @xmath128 mev in our calculations and we have taken @xmath129 mev from ref . @xcite .",
    "the branching ratios predicted in this work for the @xmath130 decays are shown in table 1 .",
    "the main uncertainty in the rates of cabibbo - suppressed channels comes from the large error bar in the @xmath131 coupling constant , while the one in the @xmath132 channel is dominated by the large uncertainty ( @xmath133 ) that we have attributed to the value of @xmath74 .",
    "since our model uses breit - wigner forms with a constant decay width and given that the contributions of higher mass virtual states have been neglected in our calculation of the form factors , further uncertainties are expected to contribute to the results shown in table 1 .",
    "in addition , in our model we have not considered the contribution of the continuum which can be associated to a contact ( non - bw ) term in the weak @xmath134 vertex .",
    "we have not estimated these uncertainties in table 1 ; eventually , the continuum contributions may be large , but they are rather difficult to evaluate in the meson dominance model like ours in the absence of constraints about such contact terms .    .branching ratios for the @xmath135 decays of the @xmath2 lepton . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the branching fractions turn out to be of order @xmath136 , with the largest rate corresponding to the @xmath4 decay mode .",
    "therefore , we can expect that the contribution of tensor meson intermediate states to the three - pseudoscalar decays of tau leptons is small .",
    "concerning the results shown in table 1 , we observe that the cabibbo - favored decay involving the @xmath85 meson is larger that the one involving the @xmath137 meson because , owing to @xmath81-parity , the former receives contributions from the dominant axial current while the second is mediated by the vector current only .",
    "similarly , the cabibbo - suppressed channels are of similar size as the cabibbo - allowed @xmath132 decays because the former receive contributions of the vector and axial currents .",
    "in addition to the above dynamical considerations , we should point out that these @xmath134 channels are suppressed mainly due to the reduced phase space available in @xmath2 lepton decays .",
    "we have studied and computed the branching ratios of the @xmath138 decays ; we have not considered final states involving kaons or @xmath33 mesons because either they are suppressed or forbidden by kinematics .",
    "we have used a meson dominance model where the form factors are dominated by the lowest lying resonances that couple to the @xmath134 system . to our knowledge , this is the first study reporting results on these peculiar @xmath2 lepton decays . beyond probing the tensor - pseudoscalar weak vertex , the processes under consideration can contribute as intermediate states in @xmath2 lepton decays involving three - pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "owing to @xmath81-parity of strong interactions , the rates of the cabibbo allowed and suppressed decay channels exhibit an interesting pattern .",
    "the cabibbo - supressed @xmath58 channels turn our to be of the same order as the cabibbo - favored @xmath132 decays , mainly because the latter receives contributions only from the vector current .",
    "the calculated branching fractions spread from @xmath139 to @xmath140 , with the largest branching fraction ( @xmath141 ) corresponding to the @xmath4 final state .",
    "eventually , these decays will be measured from the invariant mass distributions of the decay products of the intermediate @xmath8 tensor mesons in three - body decays of @xmath2 leptons , given the large data sample of @xmath2 lepton pairs recorded by the babar and belle experiments @xcite .",
