    "ytio@xmath3 is a unique 3@xmath4 ferromagnet @xcite - the most of oxides are antiferromagnetic . in combination with a rather simple perovskite structure and ti@xmath1 ions expected to have one electron in the incomplete 3@xmath4 shell , ytio@xmath0",
    "is regarded to be very good examplary system for studying basic interactions in 3@xmath4 oxides . despite this simplicity",
    "its properties are not understood yet .",
    "in fact , there is going on at present a hot debate on description of its magnetic and electronic properties @xcite .",
    "a time when such system was treated as a s=1/2 system i.e. with the spin - only magnetism and the fully quenched orbital magnetism is already gone .",
    "also the simplest versions of the band picture turned out to be completely useless giving already at the start disagreement with experiment predicting a metallic ground state whereas ytio@xmath0 is in the reality a good insulator .",
    "ytio@xmath0 , when stoichiometric , is very good insulator .",
    "its resistivity at room temperature amounts to 5@xmath510@xmath6 @xmath7 cm @xcite .",
    "the resistivity rapidly grows up with decreasing temperature .",
    "it is ferromagnetic below t@xmath8 of 30 - 35 k @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic magnetisation , if recalculated per the formula unit , points to a moment of 0.84 @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the paramagnetic susceptibility has been found to follow the curie - weiss law with @xmath10 = 39 k , if substracted a diamagnetic and temperature independent orbital contributions of a total size of 0.351@xmath510@xmath11 emu / mol .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present results of single - ion based calculations of properties of ytio@xmath0 .",
    "our single - ion results seem to be quite remarkable .",
    "we took into account low - symmetry off - octahedral crystal - field ( cef ) interactions and the intra - atomic spin - orbit ( s - o ) coupling , that turn out to be of the comparable strength .",
    "we consider exactly stechiometric ytio@xmath0 . from this and the insulating ground state",
    "we infer that all ti ions are in the trivalent state according to the charge distribution y@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath12 .",
    "the relevant charge transfer occurs during the formation of the compound . in the perovskite - based structure of ytio@xmath0",
    "the ti@xmath1 ion is surrounded by six oxygen ions forming distorted octahedron .",
    "there are still some ti ions at the surface , for instance , with a reduced symmetry , but they are generally neglected , because we are interested in intrinsic properties of ytio@xmath0 .",
    "the local octahedra in ytio@xmath0 are tilted and rotated , what causes the need for consideration a larger elementary cell , with four ti ions instead of one as in the simple perovskite structure .",
    "thanks it other three ti ions get a crystallographic freedom . as a result of rotations , tilts and other atom displacements",
    "there are four short ti - o bonds and two long ti - o bonds .",
    "the orthorhombic lattice in the pbnm structure results from that of an ideal cubic perovskite by setting @xmath13 = @xmath14 @xmath15 , @xmath16 = @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath17 = 2a@xmath8 , where @xmath15 denotes the lattice parameter of the simple cubic perovskite .",
    "@xmath15 is of order of 400 pm .    in the @xmath18 structure",
    "used by some authors the doubling occurs along the @xmath19 direction .",
    "the @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath19 axis in the @xmath18 structure becomes the @xmath21 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 axis in the @xmath22 structure , respectively .",
    "independently of the used @xmath22 or @xmath18 space group the derivation of the local surroundings must be , of course , the same .",
    "here we use the @xmath22 space group .",
    "then the easy magnetic axis is the @xmath20 axis , @xcite .",
    "the lattice parameters at t = 293 k , according to ref .",
    "2 , cited by @xcite , are : @xmath13 = 531.6 pm , @xmath16=567.9 pm and @xmath17 = 761.1 pm .",
    "these parameters have been confirmed by detailed structural measurements of loa _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "cwik _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have derived the respective bonds : 207.7 pm ( ti - o(b ) ) , 201.6 pm ( ti - o(a ) ) and the apical bond 202.3 pm ( ti - o(c ) ) .",
    "@xcite have measured influence of the external pressure on these bonds . from these crystallographic studies we get an input to our theoretical considerations that the lattice surroundings of the ti ion in ytio@xmath0 is predominantly octahedral with a slight orthorhombic distortion .",
    "the electronic structure of the ti@xmath1 ion with one d - electron under the action of the crystal - field interactions h@xmath23 and in the presence of the intra - atomic spin - orbit coupling h@xmath24 we calculated with the use of the single - ion - like hamiltonian often used in description of 3@xmath4 impurity states in the electron paramagnetic resonance @xcite , which we accept also for a solid , where 3@xmath4 atom is the full part of the crystallographic structure :    @xmath25g@xmath26    the calculated electronic structure is presented in fig .",
    "the crystal field has been divided into the cubic part , usually dominant in case of compounds containing 3@xmath4 ions , and the off - octahedral distortion written by the second - order leading term b@xmath27o@xmath27 .",
    "the last term , zeeman term , allows calculations of the influence of the external magnetic field .",
    "@xmath28 amounts to 2.0023 .",
    "the zeeman term is necessary for calculations , for instance , of the paramagnetic susceptibility - in fact the paramagnetic susceptibility is customarily calculated [ 25 ] as the magnetization in an external field of , say , 0.1 t applied along different crystallographic directions .    the detailed form of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) is written down in the ls space that is the 10 dimensional spin - orbital space @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath30 and @xmath31 quantum numbers for one 3d electron are equal to @xmath30=2 and @xmath31=1/2 ( here , for 3@xmath32 configuration , lower @xmath33 and @xmath34 could be also used ) .",
    "the hamiltonian ( 1 ) is customarilly treated by perturbation methods owing to the weakness of the s - o coupling for the 3@xmath4 ions in comparison to the strength of the crystal - field interactions .",
    "we have accepted the weakness of the s - o coupling , what is reflected by the sequence of terms in the hamiltonian ( 1 ) , but we have performed direct calculations treating all shown terms in the hamiltonian ( 1 ) on the same footing . the separate figures , if presented , are shown for the illustration reasons .",
    "diagonalization have been performed for physically relevant values of @xmath35 of + 220 k (= 150 @xmath36 ) found for the ti@xmath1 ion @xcite .",
    "the cubic cef parameter b@xmath37 is taken as + 240 k ( results are not sensitive to its exact value provided b@xmath38 @xmath39 + 50 k ) .",
    "the positive sign of b@xmath37 comes from _ ab initio _ point charge calculations of octupolar interactions of the ti@xmath1 ion with the octahedral oxygen ( negative charges ) surroundings",
    ". such value of b@xmath37 yields the @xmath40-@xmath41 splitting of 2.5 ev .",
    "a splitting of 2.15 - 2.5 ev has been observed for ti@xmath1 ions in al@xmath42o@xmath0 , where the similar oxygen octahedron exists . in lacoo@xmath0 we derived value of b@xmath38 of 280 - 320 k @xcite .    in fig .",
    "2 we show detailed calculations of the influence of the spin - orbit coupling on the three lowest states @xmath43 ( = @xmath44 ) of the 3@xmath32 configuration for the elongated ( c / a@xmath391 ) and stretched ( c / a@xmath451 ) tetragonal off - octahedral distortion , realized for b@xmath27 @xmath39 0 and b@xmath27 @xmath45 0 , respectively .",
    "analyzing the effect of the sign of the tetragonal distortion lead us to a conclusion that the magnetic moment lies along the tetragonal axis for the @xmath46-axis stretching . for the elongation case the moment lies perpendicularly to the tetragonal axis .",
    "taking into account that in ytio@xmath0 the ordered moment lies along the @xmath20 direction ( in the @xmath22 structure ) and our long - lasting studies of cef effects @xcite we came to values for b@xmath27 = -50 k and b@xmath47 = -10 k which reproduce the magnetic moment value , its direction and ( some ) thermodynamics .",
    "the calculated ground - state eigenfunction ( the @xmath46 component of @xmath30 and @xmath31 are shown )    @xmath48 = 0.690@xmath49 - 0.678@xmath50 + - 0.253@xmath51 - 0.020@xmath52 ( 2 )    where the sign @xmath53 refers to two conjugate kramers states .",
    "this state has @xmath54 = @xmath550.44 and @xmath56 = @xmath53 0.10 .",
    "the resultant moment @xmath57 = @xmath530.78 @xmath9 cancels each other in the paramagnetic state as is denoted in fig .",
    "making use of the @xmath58 function extended for the spin component , as @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 ( also functions @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) one can write the ground state @xmath66 function approximately as :    @xmath48 = 0.967@xmath58 + 0.0085@xmath67 + - 0.186@xmath68 - 0.172@xmath69    in the magnetic state",
    "the ground state @xmath48 kramers doublet function becomes polarized as a molecular field is self - consistently settled down and the function    @xmath70 = 0.695@xmath71 - 0.686@xmath72 +",
    "- 0.215@xmath73 - 0.016@xmath74    is obtained as the ground state .",
    "the higher conjugate state is calculated to be described by    @xmath75 = 0.665@xmath76 - 0.682@xmath77 - + + 0.303@xmath78 + 0.026@xmath79    below t@xmath8 there opens , as is seen in fig .",
    "3a , a spin - like gap that amounts at t = 0 k to 59.7 k (= 41.4 @xmath36 = 5.15 mev ) .",
    "the spin - like gap is associated with the splitting of the kramers doublet ground state in the ferromagnetic state .",
    "the magnetic ground state @xmath70 has @xmath54 = -0.45 and @xmath56 = + 0.06 and the resultant moment amounts to 0.84 @xmath9 .",
    "the appearance of the magnetic state is calculated self - consistently .",
    "it appears in the instability temperature ( t@xmath8 ) in the temperature dependence of the cef paramagnetic susceptibility when    @xmath80 = @xmath81 ( 6 )    as is illustrated in fig . 4 for different crystallographic directions .",
    "with decreasing temperature this equality is reached the first for the @xmath20 direction pointing the preferred magnetic arrangement axis .",
    "the magnetic state is calculated self - consistently by adding to the hamiltonian eq . ( 1 ) the inter - site magnetic ( spin - dependent ) interactions instead of the last zeeman term @xcite    @xmath82 = @xmath83 ( 7 )    where @xmath84 is the molecular - field coefficient .",
    "having eigenvalues in a function of temperature we calculate the free energy @xmath85 . from @xmath85 using well - known statistical formulae we calculate all thermodynamics like temperature dependence of the magnetic moment , of the additional @xmath86 heat capacity , of paramagnetic susceptibility , of the 3@xmath4-shell quadrupolar moment and many others .",
    "the present calculations are similar to those performed for febr@xmath42 @xcite and coo @xcite .",
    "we have calculated consistently a value of the magnetic moment of 0.84 @xmath9 and its direction ( along the @xmath20 axis in the pbnm structure ) in ytio@xmath0 as well as temperature dependence of the paramagnetic susceptibility in very good agreement with experimental observations .",
    "this remarkable reproduction of so many physical properties has been obtained within the localized - electron approach taking into account lattice off - octahedral distortions and the intra - atomic spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "although the spin - orbit coupling is weak , it amounts to only 1.2 % of the octahedral cef splitting , it has enormous influence on the low - energy electronic structure and low - temperature magnetic and electronic properties .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling binds the orbital moment to the spin moment being the reason for the spin - lattice and spin - phonon coupling .",
    "the suggested energy positions of the excited cef states have to be verified by experiment .",
    "the good reproduction of the paramagnetic susceptibility indicates on the proper overall splitting of the @xmath43 states - one should note that our splitting is about 5 times smaller than that obtained in refs @xcite .",
    "we are aware that our calculations have to be extended to take into account many other effects - first of them seems to be geometrical effects associated with the non - collinearity of the local symmetry axes , but these studies prove that magnetic properties of ytio@xmath0 are predominantly determined by the atomic - scale lattice distortions , crystal - field and the spin - orbit coupling of the ti@xmath1 ions , whereas charge fluctuations are negligible .",
    "an interplay of the spin - orbit coupling , lattice distortions and magnetic order is very subtle involving rather small energies , smaller than 5 mev making theoretical studies quite difficult .",
    "we point out that all discussed by us parameters are physical measurable parameters .",
    "the b@xmath87 and b@xmath88 parameters are related to the observed orthorhombic local surroundings . a negative value of the b@xmath87 parameter results from the stretching of the apical bonds with respect to the average bond length within the @xmath89 plane .",
    "the b@xmath88 parameter is related to the difference in the @xmath89 plane .",
    "a success of our ionic approach , called due to extension to the magnetic state a quantum atomistic solid - state theory ( quasst ) @xcite , if applied to ytio@xmath0 , is related to our long - lasting systematic studies , despite of discrimination and inquisition , of the spin - orbit coupling and crystal - field interactions in 3@xmath4 compounds and in study of the region , where the spin - orbit coupling and off - octahedral lattice distortions are of the comparable strength .",
    "* acknowledgements*. we are very grateful to all our opponents .",
    "although we do not think that the discrimination and inquisition should take place in physics at the xxi century their critics largely stimulated these , very natural for us studies .",
    "this discrimination is the best proof that the knowledge about the cef and the role of the spin - orbit coupling in 3@xmath4 magnetism is rather poor .",
    "we are thankful to a numerous members of the international committee of the strongly - correlated electron systems conference in vienna 2005 for the friendly support .",
    "we are convinced that physics can develop only in the friendly atmosphere and in the open exchange of information .",
