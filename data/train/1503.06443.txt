    ", filaments are artificially or spontaneously assembled to achieve a specific function in the material , such as directed conductivity , plasmonic resonances , or just the mechanical strength in a fiber composite , with important technological applications @xcite .",
    "finally , a conceptually related issue emerges in the denaturation of dna  @xcite , for which the available theoretical framework @xcite can not provide predictions about the topology of the disassembly process .",
    "the typical size of all these aggregates , and its time - evolution , are a non - trivial function of the rate at which bonds along the filament spontaneously dissociate due to the thermal motion of the assembled molecules .",
    "the dissociation rate and the distribution of fragments are important parameters which enter the master kinetic equation description of self - assembling filament size and populations .",
    "a filament growth can be summarized by the reversible reaction : @xmath0 , where the monomer subunit @xmath1 is added to an existing filament of @xmath2-units long . for the forward reaction",
    ", it is commonly accepted that association proceeds by the addition of a single subunit  as opposed to the joining of larger segments  because of the greater abundance of monomers with respect to active fragments .",
    "in contrast , despite the importance of thermal breakup in many fields of colloid science and technology  @xcite , its basic understanding is far from satisfactory .",
    "several studies aimed to explain thermally - activated filament breakup in physical terms , came to the conclusion that fibrils of any respective size can aggregate , while the filament breakup can occur with equal probability anywhere along its length .",
    "in particular , lee  @xcite has demonstrated that the thermal breakup occurs randomly along the chain , leading to daughter fragments of any size . in yet another classical model based on equilibrium detailed - balance between the various aggregation and breakup events , by hill  @xcite , the highest breakup probability is for two fragments of equal size , i.e. the breakup rate is maximum in the middle .",
    "theoretical models in the past have focused on the simplified case of chains of harmonically bonded particles ( subunits ) , so that the binding force is linear in the inter - protein displacement  @xcite . in this approximation",
    "the normal modes of vibration of the chain are de - coupled , which makes the problem amenable to simpler analysis . even in this case",
    ", previous theoretical models reached contradictory conclusions , with either flat breakup distribution or a pronounced maximum in the middle .",
    "however , the physical bonds linking protein filament subunits ( such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic attraction ) are strongly anharmonic",
    ". then the problem becomes one of coupled nonlinear oscillators as in the famous fermi - pasta - ulam problem  @xcite , for which the typical vibration modes are no longer delocalized periodic waves but solitons  @xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with the finding  @xcite that in a strained lennard - jones chain , the strain is not uniformly distributed , but localized around the bond which is going to break first .",
    "the standard tools of chemical dynamics and stochastic rate theory  @xcite , all based on the harmonic approximation and on normal modes , are therefore inapplicable  @xcite .    here we develop a systematic microscopic understanding of this process based on brownian dynamics simulation and theoretical arguments , focusing on the nonequilibrium breakup phenomena .",
    "hence we study the intrinsic breakup rates independent of any recombination phenomena which may occur at later stages leading eventually to an equilibrium size .",
    "first of all , we discover that the topology of filament breakup critically depends on the bending stiffness of the chain .",
    "secondly , a clear connection is found between the anharmonicity of subunit interaction and the fragment distribution resulting from thermal breakup .",
    "the anharmonic lennard - jones or morse - like binding potential in stiff or semiflexible filaments inevitably leads to a very strong preference for the breakup to occur at chain ends , but recover the uniform , flat fragment distribution in the limit of harmonic ( or any other symmetric ) potential .",
    "importantly , it is not the bare anharmonicity which controls this effect , but , more precisely , the _ asymmetry _ of the bonding potential about the minimum ( larger force for bond compression than for extension ) , which is inherent to the most common anharmonic potentials .",
    "as we will show below , it is precisely the asymmetry in the potential which `` breaks the symmetry '' between dissociation rates at the middle of the filament and at the ends .",
    "those rates are equal only for symmetric potentials like harmonic , and they always differ for asymmetric potentials .    in contrast , when the intermolecular interaction is purely of the central - force type , i.e. a fully flexible chain with no bending resistance , a bell - like distribution peaked in the middle is obtained in accord with the prediction of the hill model . these findings can be understood with an argument based on counting the degrees of freedom per particle for the different potentials .",
    "these results provide a fundamental link between the features of intermolecular interaction and the filament breakup rate and topology , and can be used in the future to predict , control and manipulate the filament length distribution in a variety of self - assembly processes in biological and nanomaterials applications .",
    "to model a non - covalently bonded filament we use a coarse - grained model of linear chains of brownian particles ( fig.[fig1]a ) bonded by the truncated - shifted lennard - jones ( lj ) potential , @xmath3 - { u_c},~~{\\rm { for } } ~r < { r_c}}\\\\ { 0 , \\qquad { \\rm { for } } ~r \\ge { r_c } } \\end{array } } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the distance between two neighbor proteins @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the linear size of the monomer unit , and @xmath8 $ ] .",

    "the lj potential is inherently anharmonic , except in the close proximity of its minimum",
    ". an alternative could be the morse potential , and we have checked that the results do not change qualitatively with its use .",
    "figure [ fig1]b explains what we mean by truncation : the attractive region stretches up to a distance @xmath12 ( indicated by arrows in the plot and measured in terms of lj length scale @xmath7 ) , while the depth of the potential well is kept independently fixed ( measured by @xmath10 , in units of @xmath13 ) .",
    "the shorter the attraction range , the closer is the potential to its harmonic approximation .",
    "for all the data we use @xmath14 , which well approximates the strength of the most common physical interactions such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic attraction .",
    "we also include in our analysis the local bending energy , in the form @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the angle between the directions of bonds from the particle @xmath5 to the preceding ( @xmath17 ) and the subsequent ( @xmath6 ) subunits .",
    "figure  [ fig1]d illustrates the way this effect is implemented by imposing pairs of equal and opposite forces on the joining bonds , providing a net torque on the junction .",
    "it is the same algorithm that is used in , e.g. lammps ` angle - harmonic ' system @xcite . the bending modulus @xmath18 , in units of @xmath19 ,",
    "is directly related to the persistence length of the filament via the standard expression @xmath20 .     in the chain , for several values of attractive range , measured by @xmath12 and indicated by arrows in the plot .",

    "the dynamics of the chain of subunits is governed by the overdamped langevin equation , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the vector containing the positions of all molecules , @xmath24 is the friction coefficient , the total potential force acting on a given particle , @xmath25 , has contribution from both the lj and the bending couples , and the gaussian stochastic force defined such that @xmath26 and @xmath27 , according to the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . for numerical integration eq .",

    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , @xmath42 independent runs are performed and the normalised breakup probability is calculated as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the total number of recorded breakup events for the bond @xmath45 . for most data",

    "the resulting snapshots , for each value of @xmath18 indicated on the image , show the effect of differing persistence length . ]",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the main result of our brownian dynamics simulation : on increasing the bending stiffness of the filament , the highly inhomogeneous normalized probability @xmath48 changes from a bell - shaped distribution peaked in the middle ( reminding of the hill model ) , to a completely opposite shape , with a strong preference for single subunits to dissociate from the ends .     and lj parameters @xmath14 , @xmath50 . the effect of changing bending stiffness ( increasing persistence length ) is evident : for the chain with essentially no bending penalty ( lowest @xmath18 ) the distribution of fragment sizes is bell - shaped with a maximum in the middle of the middle of the filament .",
    "stiff chains , with a strong bond - bending penalty , instead , feature a nearly homogeneous , flat distribution of fragment sizes  with an increasingly large increase of breakup rate at the ends .",
    "there is a broad range of semiflexible filaments that behave in exactly the same way : as `` stiff '' chains . ]",
    "the conclusion arising from this data is clear : there is a broad range of what one could collectively interpret as ` stiff ' filaments , for which the nature of bond - breaking statistics is exactly the same .",
    "these are with the bending stiffness of @xmath52 , and their behaviour does not differ from the last dataset in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( labelled ` stiff ' ) , corresponding to the strictly 1-dimensional filament where only the motions along the chain were permitted . for these stiff or semiflexible filaments",
    "there is a very strong preference to dissociate a single subunit from the chain ends , which does diminish for less symmetric potentials , as demonstrated by fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] below .",
    "however , as the chain becomes increasingly flexible , the ratio of breaking rates at the ends and in the middle gradually reverses , and for a very flexible chain ( @xmath53 in the plot ) the breakup probability resembles the prediction from the hill model .",
    "one can qualitatively understand this effect : for a stiff filament ( as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1]a and [ figk ] ) , in order to develop a thermal fluctuation large enough to stretch a bond beyond @xmath12 , a whole sequence of bonded particles has to move in a correlated fashion ; this leads to an effectively harmonic potential acting on the middle particles , and diminishes their breaking rate very significantly . on the other hand ,",
    "as the particles in a flexible chain are free to move perpendicular to the bond axis , this coherent motion is not required and the bond breaking statistics is dominated by the single - bond equilibrium .",
    "most protein filaments are quite stiff .",
    "the f - actin has the quoted persistence length @xmath54 m @xcite , and the insulin amyloid filaments : @xmath55 m @xcite .",
    "interestingly , if one measures @xmath56 in the units of constituent protein size ( as the parameter @xmath7 in our case ) , these very different filaments all have @xmath56 between 3000 and 6000 units .",
    "we therefore choose the bending stiffness modulus @xmath57 in all subsequent analysis , which is within the class of ` stiff ' filaments according to the data in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .     long , bonded by potentials with @xmath58 and @xmath57 .",
    "the harmonic potential with the same depth has a uniform ( homogeneous ) probability of breakup , while at increasing @xmath12 ( and the degree of potential asymmetry about the minimum ) the ends of the chain are increasingly more prone to single - particle depolymerization .",
    "the ratio of the probability of breaking at the end ( dissociation ) to the fragmentation in the middle @xmath59 for @xmath50 . ]",
    "this distribution of breaking points along the chain is equivalent to the distribution of fragment sizes resulting upon breakup .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows how this distribution depends on the nature of physical bond between subunits . as we have seen in the illustration , fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , changing the cutoff distance @xmath12 while keeping the depth of the attractive potential well constant ( @xmath10 ) effectively alters the degree of potential asymmetry : the larger the @xmath12 , the more asymmetric the potential is .",
    "we have also independently tested the breaking statistics in an explicitly harmonic potential of the same depth and curvature at the minimum . in the limit of harmonic chain , we recover a completely uniform ( flat ) distribution of fragments , with a very high accuracy .",
    "this is in agreement with the theory of lee  @xcite , who assumed harmonic bonds .",
    "on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] clearly demonstrates that , with increasing asymmetry , the breakup probability @xmath48 displays an increasingly strong preference for depolymerization from the ends . for the highly asymmetric ( and also highly anharmonic ) potential with @xmath50 ,",
    "the breakup probability of the outer bonds is over @xmath60 times larger than the one of the innermost bonds .    , and",

    "we therefore chose to scale all datasets by their maximum value of @xmath64 , such that the different curves are comparable .",
    "it is clear that with the filament increasing past @xmath65 there is no further change in the characteristic ratio @xmath63  simply the region of ` chain middle ' becomes extended .",
    "perhaps one may regard this as an effective confirmation of the lee model @xcite , since for very long and very stiff filaments a very large middle section has an effectively harmonic bonding , and therefore uniform breakup rate .",
    "it appears , the range of enhanced probability near the ends is relatively constant , @xmath66 .",
    "shorter filaments have the middle region elevated simply because the two end - effects start overlapping .    the finding",
    "that , for stiff filaments with asymmetric interaction potentials , the dissociation rate at the end can be substantially larger than the rate of fragmentation in the middle , may be important in the self - assembly kinetics of actin filaments @xcite . there , and in many other cases , the tendency to depolymerize at the end is amplified by the presence of multiple bonds in the interior of the filament , due to the double - stranded helical structure in the case of actin .",
    "in addition , we studied the probability of the first breakup ( irrespective of its position along the filament ) , upon varying @xmath12 and the filament length @xmath2 , for the case of a stiff filament ( limit of large @xmath18 ) which also approximates the case of a 1d aggregate . from the results plotted in log - linear fashion in fig.[fig6 ]",
    "it is clear that the probability for the chain to fracture depends exponentially on time , @xmath67 , with a characteristic breakup time @xmath68 increasing upon increasing the attraction range @xmath12 ( and the asymmetry of bonding potential with that ) .",
    "the average first - breakup time , irrespective of the location on the chain , is defined by @xmath69 , upon normalizing @xmath70 .",

    "the probability as a function of time that all bonds remain within the cutoff at a time @xmath75 , that is , the probability that the chain does not break within a time @xmath75 , is given by @xmath76 .",
    "we shall recall that , in supervector notation , the condition @xmath77 means that _ all _ bond vectors ( relative particle coordinates ) in the chain are within an extension smaller than the cutoff @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath78 represents the multi - dimensional potential energy landscape given by the superposition of the lennard - jones potentials acting on pairs of molecules .",
    "the first passage / breakup time probability density is defined as the change of @xmath79 between the time @xmath75 and @xmath80 , and is thus given by @xmath81 . combining these equations , with some manipulations ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it is possible to show that the first - passage time probability density is exactly equal to @xmath82 .",
    "the mean first - breakup time is then defined as the first moment of the first - breakup time probability density , @xmath83dt } $ ] , which is the same quantity as measured from the exponential fits in simulations . the exponential dependence on time can be understood from the analysis of the many - particle fokker - planck equation , eqs .",

    "furthermore , the rate @xmath90 grows roughly linearly with the chain length @xmath2 , which is demonstrated in fig .",

    "we find a useful representation in a map that covers all of the @xmath18-@xmath12 parameter space to study how the location of first - breakup events along the filament changes upon varying both the stiffness @xmath18 and the cutoff or asymmetry @xmath12 .",

    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] we have shown that depending on the relative extent of bond - bending and central forces in the intermolecular interaction , the fragment size distribution can change from a u - shaped distribution in the limit of large bond - bending rigidity , to a bell - shaped distribution with opposite curvature in the limit of a purely central - force lennard - jones potential .",
    "intermediate bending stiffness values yield distributions with shape in between the two limiting cases .",

    "a full consideration of the normal modes of the linear chain with free ends , beyond the einstein model , leads to an additional nontrivial size - dependence @xmath125 , for vibrations of harmonic spheres in 1d , and to @xmath126 for vibrations in a flexible 3d chain  @xcite . in simple terms , upon increasing the chain length ,",
    "more low - energy modes can be accommodated in the spectrum , which causes the partition function to decrease .",

    "for central forces , @xmath131 , whereas with semiflexible or stiff chains one has @xmath132 .",
    "the leading contribution is then @xmath133 , with a pronounced bell - shape peaked in the middle for the exclusively central - force flexible chain , and @xmath134 , leading to a much flatter distribution for a chain with bond - bending penalty .",
    "the fact that the slightly u - shaped distribution observed in simulations for stiff filaments is not recovered by this model should be attributed to the various approximations ( kirkwood - riseman for chain diffusion , detailed balance , etc . )",
    "involved in the model , and also to the harmonic approximation of independent linear oscillators underlying the factorization of partition functions .",
    "this argument , however , explains , qualitatively , that a flatter distribution of fragments is to be expected in the presence of bond - bending , due to the additional rotational degrees of freedom about the stiff intermolecular bond symmetry axis , which is absent with purely central - force interactions",
    ".      we can briefly comment on the qualitative predictions of this model for the distribution of breakup fragments in realistic amyloid fibrils .",
    "realistic intermolecular forces which bind proteins in amyloid fibrils crucially depend on both electrostatics and temperature .",
    "we shall start considering the role of electrostatics first .",
    "electrostatic repulsion between two bound proteins in a filament is ubiquitous except for solutions at very high ionic strength .",
    "electrostatic repulsion acts to `` lift up '' the bonding minimum , and it may also contribute an additional small energy barrier to the total interaction @xmath135 , with a maximum @xmath136 co - existing or competing with the new lifted attractive minimum .",
    "we denote the new attractive minimum as @xmath137 . due to the fact that the electrostatic energy decreases with @xmath4 , and the maximum is typically at @xmath138 , the lifting up of the bonding minimum by the electrostatic repulsion is not entirely compensated by the energy barrier ( the new maximum in @xmath135 ) .",
    "hence the total energy to be overcome for the particle to escape from the bonding minimum is @xmath139 .",
    "this consideration points towards a role of electrostatics which promotes breakup , or at least , restructuring into a different morphology where the electrostatic energy density is reduced .",
    "this outcome of our analysis is compatible with recent experimental observations where an increased electrostatic repulsions ( e.g. at lower ionic strengths ) is responsible for fission or scission phenomena of larger compact aggregates into smaller and more anisotropic aggregates  @xcite .",
    "our simulations show a crossover from a u - shaped fragment distribution into a bell - shaped distribution upon going from high values of bond - bending stiffness @xmath18 to lower values . in our simulations , @xmath18 is fixed and set independently of @xmath140 , the latter being kept constant throughout at varying @xmath18 . in reality , however , @xmath18 and @xmath140 may not be decoupled for a realistic model of amyloid fibrils .",
    "the reason is that the inter - protein bending stiffness @xmath18 originates , microscopically , from the strength of @xmath141-sheets which bind two adjacent proteins in the fibril .",
    "the mechanism is known : due to the planar , sheet - like , nature of two hydrogen - bonded @xmath141-sheets , there is an intrinsic bending resistance against sliding or rolling of the two proteins past each other . the same mechanism provides bending rigidity when two surfaces bonded by many anchored central - force springs are displaced tangentially apart . upon increasing @xmath140 ,",
    "the hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds which keep the two @xmath141-sheets together start to dissociate , leading to lower bending stiffness and lower values of @xmath18 .    hence , based on our simulation results , we can predict that the fragment distribution function of realistic amyloid fibrils should evolve from a u - shaped distribution at low temperature @xmath140 , where the @xmath141-sheets of two adjacent proteins are tightly bound , into a bell - shaped distribution at higher @xmath140 where the @xmath141-sheet bonding becomes looser , which makes the bending stiffness @xmath18 decrease .",
    "this prediction seems to be confirmed by preliminary experiments  @xcite , and future work using ab - initio simulations should focus on identifying the relationship between @xmath18 and @xmath140 , which controls the evolution of the fragment distribution with @xmath140 . in future research",
    "it will be important to combine all these effects into a general coarse - grained approach along the lines of  @xcite , to achieve a bottom - up description of realistic filaments and their size evolution .",
    "when the bending rigidity of the chain is high , the probability of spontaneous bond breaking is flat when the bond potential is harmonic  @xcite  yet it adopts a very distinct and very strongly biased u - shape when the /asymmetry of the potential increases ( fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "how can we quantitatively explain why the asymmetry of interaction potential between any two bonded subunits leads to higher breakup rates at the chain ends , and much smaller breakup rates in the middle ? for a high bending modulus one can treat the bond at the filament end as a classical diatomic molecule , and a subunit in the middle of the chain as the inner particle in a linear triatomic molecule . in the latter case",
    ", the combined potential @xmath142 felt by the particle in the middle is sketched in fig.[fig1]c .",
    "one would be tempted to explain the difference between the higher dissociation rate at the filament end and the lower one in the middle by referring to the overall lower energy ( deeper potential well ) felt by the particle in the middle sitting in the minimum of the combined potential @xmath21 . applying a kramers - type escape - rate argument",
    "would then lead to an arrhenius dependence of the particle on the depth of the energy well and an overall large difference between the two rates .",
    "however , such an approach can not explain the observation that the rate is the same in the middle and at the end for the case of harmonic potential ; in that case the same argument about @xmath142 applies hence one would expect a lower rate in the middle , which is not observed , in agreement with previous calculations  @xcite .",
    "what is different in the case of the harmonic potential , is the fact that the asymmetry of the bonding potential is removed for the particle at the end of the chain ( while the subunits in the middle effectively experience the harmonic potential in both cases ) .",
    "it is in fact this asymmetry which facilitates dissociation at the termini of the chain , where less resistance is encountered by the particle escaping outwardly from the bound state . in order to verify that this is indeed the right physics",
    ", we also run a test simulation with a quartic potential @xmath143 , which is anharmonic yet fully symmetric about the minimum , just like the harmonic potential .",
    "also in this case we found a completely flat distribution of fragments , as for the harmonic potential , which supports the proposed claim .",
    "it is therefore the asymmetry , in the case of anharmonic potentials , which plays the major role in facilitating the preferential bond breakup at the chain ends .",
    "the explanation can be found in the different values of the mean thermal fluctuation from the equilibrium position ( energy minimum ) for the particle sitting in the asymmetric lj potential at the chain end , and the particle moving in the more symmetric combined potential @xmath21 in the middle of the chain .",
    "an analysis of the mean thermal fluctuation done long ago by j. frenkel  @xcite , shows that the mean thermal fluctuation of the particle feeling the anharmonic / asymmetric potential at the end is typically larger because of the shallower slope of the potential in the outward direction . for the particle in the middle ,",
    "the situation is different because the combined potential @xmath21 does not become shallower as the particle in the middle moves away from one of the two neighbours , due to the presence of the interaction with the other neighbour .",
    "by means of brownian dynamics simulations , we have shown that thermal breakup rates and breakup topology of model protein filaments ( and other linear nanoparticle aggregates ) are strongly affected by the presence of bond - bending stiffness in the interaction between subunits , and by the degree of asymmetry of the anharmonic binding potential . with stiff chains bonded by inter - particle forces with anharmonicity and asymmetry of the potential typical for intermolecular interaction potentials ( van der waals , hydrophobic attraction etc ) ,",
    "we find a strongly preferential breakup at the chain ends , and an overall u - shaped fragment distribution .",
    "in contrast , with purely central - force interactions between subunits , that is , fully flexible chains  the fragment size distribution is bell - shaped , with a pronounced peak in the middle ( symmetric breakup ) , and the lowest breakup rate is found at the ends of the chain .    while the preferential breakup at the end of stiff chains ( filament depolymerization ) can be explained in terms of the larger thermal fluctuations at the chain - end associated with potential anharmonicity / asymmetry in a perfectly stiff quasi-1d chain model , the dramatic change of breakup topology upon varying the strength of bond - bending interaction",
    "is more subtle .",
    "in this case we found a tentative explanation upon considering the degrees of freedom associated with the vibrational partition function of the fragments .",
    "in general , breakup into two equal fragments is favoured with purely central - force bonds because the product of the partition functions of two fragments is maximised ( which is intuitive if one considers that the classical partition function for rigid body motions increases strongly with the fragment size ) .",
    "the vibrational partition function , instead , decreases with fragment size because more low - energy modes can be accommodated in longer fragments .",
    "this effect becomes stronger in the case of bond - bending , where the total number of vibrational degrees of freedom is larger due to the rotation axis of the stiff bond . as a result of this compensation between the size dependencies of the vibrational and rigid - body partition functions ,",
    "the size - dependence of fragmentation rate with bond - bending is much weaker compared to the central - force case .",
    "hence , we found some general laws which govern the fragmentation behavior of model linear aggregates , as a function of the relative importance of central - force and bond - bending interactions between subunits .",
    "these findings are important towards achieving a bottom - up control over the length and time - evolution of filament populations , both in biological problems ( acting , amyloid fibrils etc . ) and in nanoparticle self - assembly for photonic applications .",
