    "most t  tauri stars are observed to be in multiple systems ( mathieu  1994 ) .",
    "there is also indirect evidence that the sizes of circumstellar disks contained within binary systems are correlated with the binary separation ( osterloh  & beckwith  1995 , jensen , mathieu  & fuller  1996 ) .",
    "this suggests that binary companions are responsible for limiting the sizes of the discs through tidal truncation ( papaloizou  & pringle  1977 , paczyski  1977 ) .",
    "there are indications that , in binaries , the plane of at least one of the circumstellar discs and that of the orbit may not necessarily be aligned . the most striking evidence for such noncoplanarity is given by hst and adaptive optics images of hk  tau ( stapelfeldt et al",
    ". 1998 , koresko  1998 ) .",
    "also , observations of molecular outflows in star forming regions commonly show several jets of different orientations emanating from an unresolved region the extent of which can be as small as @xmath0  au ( davis , mundt  & eislffel  1994 ) .",
    "these jets are usually believed to originate from a binary in which circumstellar disks are misaligned , and in some of these systems a binary has indeed been resolved . in such cases ,",
    "we expect tidal interaction to induce the precession of the disk ( possibly both disks ) which is not in the orbital plane , and thus of any jet it drives .",
    "furthermore , a number of jets seem to be precessing ( see below ) .",
    "the above discussion leads us to interpret this precessional motion as being driven by tidal interactions between the disk from which the jet originates and a companion on an inclined orbit .    in this _",
    "letter _ we consider several observed systems in the light of this model . in ",
    "[ sec : theory ] we review the theory of precessing warped disks . in   [ sec : obs ] we apply it to observed systems .",
    "we first consider cases where a precessing jet has been observed and calculate the parameters of the binaries in which tidal interactions would produce the observationally inferred precession frequencies .",
    "we next study cases where misaligned jets have been observed and , assuming or using the fact that the source of these outflows is a binary , we calculate the precession frequency that would be induced by tidal interactions in the binary and the lengthscale over which the jets should wiggle or bend as a result of this precessional motion . in   [ sec : disc ] we give a summary and discussion of our results .",
    "we consider a binary system in which the primary and the secondary have a mass @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "we suppose that the primary is surrounded by a disk of radius @xmath3 with negligible mass so that precession of the orbital plane can be neglected . the binary orbit is assumed circular with radius @xmath4 and is in a plane with inclination angle @xmath5 to the plane of this disk . in general",
    ", @xmath5 will be evolving with time .",
    "however , this evolution , _ which is not necessarily toward coplanarity _ , occurs on a long timescale ( equal or larger than the disk viscous timescale ) if the warp is not too severe ( papaloizou  & terquem  1995 ) , so that we will consider here @xmath5 as a constant .",
    "this means that although the outer parts of the disk may be driven out of the initial disk plane on a relatively short timescale , the inner parts will retain their orientation with respect to the orbital plane for a timescale comparable to the disk viscous timescale .",
    "since jets are expected to originate from the disk inner parts , their orientation relative to the orbital plane will be determined by that of the disk inner regions .",
    "the secular perturbation caused by the companion leads to the precession of the disk about the orbital axis , as in a gyroscope . _",
    "the disk is expected to precess as a rigid body _ if it can communicate with itself through some physical process on a timescale less than the precession period . in non  self gravitating protostellar disks , communication is governed by bending waves ( papaloizou  & lin 1995 , larwood et al . 1996 , terquem 1998 ) .",
    "the condition for rigid body precession is then satisfied if @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the ( uniform ) precession frequency in the disk and @xmath8 is the angular velocity at the disk outer edge ( papaloizou  & terquem 1995 ) . an expression for @xmath7 has been derived by papaloizou  & terquem ( 1995 ) .",
    "here we just give an approximate expression , that we derive by assuming that the disk surface density is uniform and that the rotation is keplerian :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the assumptions under which this expression is valid ( see terquem 1998 for a summary ) are usually satisfied in the case of the relatively wide binaries we will be discussing here and for the values of @xmath11 we will be considering . although we have assumed a circular orbit , an eccentric binary orbit can be considered by replacing @xmath4 by the semi - major axis and multiplying the precession frequency by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the eccentricity .",
    "on this basis we consider that the discussion presented below should remain valid for @xmath14",
    "observations of molecular outflows in star forming regions show in some cases `` wiggling '' knots ( or a helical pattern in projection onto the plane of the sky ) , which can be interpreted as being the result of the precession of the outflowing jet . in this section",
    "we will assume that such precession is caused by tidal interaction between the disk from which the outflow originates and a companion star in a noncoplanar orbit . in cases where the outflow has lasted many precession periods",
    "the implication is that the `` wiggling '' should be periodic .",
    "if we indeed assume that this is the case , the observations give the projected wavelength @xmath15 when the angle @xmath16 between the outflow and the line of sight can be estimated , the actual wavelength @xmath17 can be derived .",
    "the precession period is then given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the outflow velocity , and @xmath20 furthermore , if the outflow is precessing because the disk plane and that of the orbit are misaligned , the angle @xmath5 between these two planes is equal to the angle between the central flow axis and the line of maximum deviation of the flow from this axis .",
    "this angle can also be observed . in all the cases studied in this section ,",
    "@xmath5 is small enough ( @xmath21 ) so that we will consider @xmath22 .    in this section",
    "we will adopt @xmath23  @xmath24 . since we do not know whether the jet which is observed to precess originates from the primary or the secondary",
    ", we will consider mass ratios @xmath25 between 0.5 and 2 .",
    "the lowest ( largest ) values would correspond to the case where the jet originates from the primary ( secondary ) .",
    "these values are typical for pre ",
    "main sequence binaries .",
    "finally , the disk from which the outflow originates is expected to have its size truncated by tidal interaction with the companion star in such a way that @xmath11 lies between 2 and 4 . since larwood et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have shown that tidal truncation is only marginally affected by lack of coplanarity , in this section we will consider @xmath26 . assuming a fixed ratio @xmath27 equation  ( [ prec ] )",
    "can then be used to calculate the disk radius :    @xmath28    since @xmath1 appears with the power @xmath29 , an uncertainty of a factor 2 over @xmath1 is equivalent to an uncertainty of only a factor 1.26 over @xmath3 .",
    "the main uncertainty over @xmath3 comes through the ratio @xmath30 .",

    "such a separation may be possible to resolve with the vla or adaptive optics in the near - infrared .      in the systems presented in this section , misaligned `` binary '' jets have been observed .",
    "since it is very unlikely that one single source can drive two jets with very different orientations , it is assumed that each of the outflows originates from its own component of a binary system . in some cases a binary",
    "has actually been resolved , in other cases observations only allow us to put an upper limit on the separation of the hypothetical binary . since the outflows are not parallel , it is probable that the disks which surround these sources are themselves misaligned",
