    "following the celebrated discovery of neutrino oscillations  @xcite subsequent accelerator and reactor studies have brought neutrino physics to the mature phase of precision studies . sensitive laboratory oscillation studies not only play a key role in confirming the neutrino oscillation hypothesis , but also rule out exotic solutions , establishing the robustness of the simplest three neutrino paradigm .    given its importance , more than",
    "ever it has become relevant to critically assess with improved sensitivity the robustness of the determination of the three - neutrino oscillation parameters within recent and current studies  @xcite as well as future experiments  @xcite .",
    "this includes the scrutiny of the uncertainties associated with neutrino fluxes , propagation and interactions .",
    "these may arise , for example , from helioseismology  @xcite , solar chemical composition and solar fusion reactions  @xcite , density fluctuations deep within the sun  @xcite as well as magnetic fields in the radiative  @xcite and convective zones  @xcite .",
    "these issues have been widely explored , so here we focus on the impact of non - unitarity of the lepton mixing matrix upon neutrino propagation and the resulting expected sensitivities on the three  neutrino cp phase determination  @xcite .",
    "non - unitarity of the lepton mixing matrix constitutes a characteristic feature of schemes where neutrino masses arise from the exchange of fermionic messengers @xcite such as the type - i seesaw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "indeed there is a large class of low - scale variants of the seesaw mechanism , such as inverse and linear seesaw  @xcite , where these right - handed neutrino messengers are not - so - heavy , as their masses could lie within reach of the lhc experiments . in this case one",
    "expects sizeable departures from unitarity in the lepton mixing matrix characterizing the light neutrino sector  @xcite .",
    "this brings in cp violation associated to the messenger sector into the physics describing the propagation of the light neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "the presence of unitarity violation makes it difficult to extract reliable information on leptonic and , indeed , first quantitative studies indicate the existence of a potentially serious ambiguity in probing cp violation in neutrino oscillations in such case  @xcite . as a result , dedicated leptonic cp violation studies taking into account the non - unitarity of the lepton mixing matrix",
    "will be necessary .",
    "such studies can shed light on the seesaw scale , and thereby provide valuable insight on the scale of new physics responsible for neutrino mass generation .",
    "in this paper we focus on the possible ambiguities in the cp phase determination for the upcoming dune experiment , including matter effects in a consistent way .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in order to set up the framework in section  [ sec : prel - updat - bounds ]",
    "we compile and update the bounds on the relevant parameters .",
    "these follow , for instance , from weak universality tests and short  distance neutrino oscillation searches . in section  [ sec : non - unit - oscill ] we discuss the neutrino effective matter potential in the presence of non - unitarity and present the corresponding results for the oscillation probabilities in matter . in section  [ sec : nudune ] we study the sensitivity of the dune experiment to non - unitary neutrino mixing .",
    "first we discuss the determination of the standard three - neutrino cp phase @xmath1 and the possible confusion with the seesaw phase .",
    "finally we analyze the potential capability of dune in further constraining the non - unitarity of the light neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "further discussion and conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "within a large variety of seesaw schemes the lepton mixing matrix describing the propagation of the light neutrinos is effectively non - unitary , hence these neutrino states are not exactly orthonormal  @xcite .",
    "the description of this situation can be readily obtained by truncating the symmetrical parametrization of the full rectangular lepton mixing matrix characterizing general seesaw schemes , first given in  @xcite .",
    "the resulting form can be written as  @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the conventional unitary mixing matrix describing neutrino propagation in the standard case , and the pre - factor parametrizes the deviations from unitarity .",
    "this convenient description is general and holds for any number of extra neutrino states  @xcite .",
    "it involves three real parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( all close to one ) plus three small complex parameters @xmath6 containing extra cp violation .",
    "the resulting form provides the most general framework to describe neutrino oscillations relaxing the unitarity approximation .    in order to set the stage for our analysis",
    "we first give a brief review on the constraints on non - unitarity parameters . in what follows we update the discussion given in  @xcite , e.g. by including recent results for observables coming from pion decay studies  @xcite .",
    "we also discuss the interplay as well as the complementarity of various `` prior '' restrictions with what can be learned by direct neutrino studies .",
    "the bottom - line of our discussion will be that few of these constraints are of general validity , most are model - dependent .",
    "here we show how , from general considerations , the constraints from weak no - universality translate into restrictions on non - diagonal @xmath7 parameters . in order to see this",
    "consider the parametrization of the non - unitary lepton mixing matrix in eq .",
    "[ eq : nu ] .",
    "the diagonal entries of the pre - factor matrix are given as a product of cosines  @xcite : @xmath8 while the non - diagonal parameters are expressed as  @xcite : @xmath9 with the phase factors @xmath10 and @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "since the `` heavy '' iso - singlet admixture is assumed to be small , both on theoretical grounds as well as from experimental evidence  @xcite , we now treat unitarity violation as a perturbation , making use of an small - angle expansion in @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , so that @xmath14 on the other hand one can show that @xmath15 so that @xmath16 now from the triangle inequality relation one can write @xmath17 which implies the relation @xmath18 and similar relations will hold for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , namely , @xmath21 these relations imply additional restrictions on non - diagonal entries coming from constraints on the diagonal ones . in the next section",
    "we will see that bounds on diagonal entries are relatively strong reinforcing the bounds on non - diagonal ones .",
    "this also implies that and rates in the charged sector are constrained mainly by universality restrictions , not by the smallness of neutrino masses themselves .",
    "this important observation has previously been made in a number of papers and reviews  @xcite . in the next subsection",
    "we compile bounds from universality as well as from the relevant neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the non - unitarity of the light neutrino mixing matrix can be constrained by several observables related to weak universality .",
    "* as has been widely discussed in the literature  @xcite , the comparison of measurements of muon and beta decay rates can constrain the non - unitarity of the neutrino mixing matrix . for example , the fermi constant value for muon and beta decay will be proportional to different non - unitary parameter combinations : @xmath22 and @xmath23 this will imply that the ckm elements @xmath24 and @xmath25 , proportional to the fermi constant @xmath26 , should be corrected by the corresponding factor and expressed as  @xcite : @xmath27 the experimental value of this expression is given by  @xcite : @xmath28 * the mass of the @xmath29 boson , @xmath30 , is related with the values of the weak mixing angle , @xmath31 , and the fermi constant . including radiative corrections , in the on - shell renormalization scheme ,",
    "this relation can be written as  @xcite : @xmath32 with @xmath33 where @xmath34 includes the radiative corrections relating @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath30 and @xmath38 . in the non - unitary case ,",
    "the fermi constant should take into account the corresponding corrections and the prescription for @xmath39 will be : + @xmath40 * the couplings between leptons and gauge bosons are dictated by gauge symmetry . for the standard case of lepton unitarity",
    "these are flavor independent .",
    "this feature is no longer true in the presence of non - unitarity . as a result ,",
    "the ratio between two different semileptonic decay rates would constrain non - unitarity parameters .",
    "for example , for the case of pion decay we have  @xcite : @xmath41 here we include the updated measurement from ref .",
    "@xcite and theoretical prediction in refs .",
    "@xcite : @xmath42 notice that this constraint is more restrictive than the previously reported value , @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "one also has the corresponding bound from kaon - decay @xcite @xmath44 however , this limit does not play a significant role , since the pion decay measurements are more restrictive . * likewise , for the case of @xmath45 universality there are restrictions that follow from the ratio of the decay of the meson ( @xmath46 or @xmath47 ) to a muon plus a muon neutrino , or from the tau decay to a meson and a tau neutrino  @xcite : + @xmath48 + where @xmath49 stands for either @xmath46 or @xmath47 mesons .",
    "several ratios can be considered and included in the analysis . in particular",
    "we have considered the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . + * on the other hand , for the @xmath50 - @xmath51 sector , we have considered only pure leptonic decays as well as direct leptonic decays of @xmath29 boson , which lead to @xmath52 the value of @xmath53 ratio for each process was presented in  @xcite .",
    "* non - unitarity can affect the neutral current couplings . as noted in  @xcite ,",
    "these are no longer `` trivial '' as in the standard model since the couplings of light neutrinos to the z - boson can be non - diagonal in the mass basis .",
    "moreover the diagonal coupling strengths are smaller than in the standard model thereby decreasing the invisible z width , well measured at lep and reported to be slightly smaller than three ( @xmath54 )  @xcite",
    ". however , neutral currents have a more complex structure that will depend both on the values of the @xmath35 parameters as well as on the values of the three by three matrix @xmath55 . given this complexity and the quadratic dependence on the @xmath35 , it is safe not to include this observable into the analysis .",
    "concerning searches for lepton flavor and cp violating processes we notice that these do not give us any independent robust constraint on unitarity violation .",
    "indeed , such processes may proceed in the absence of neutrino mass and are only restricted by weak universality tests  @xcite .",

    "for example , the conversion probability from muon to electron neutrinos can be written as  @xcite , @xmath89 after neglecting cubic products of the small parameters @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 . here",
    ", @xmath93 stands for the standard conversion probability in the unitary case , while the interference probability term @xmath94 depends on the non - unitarity parameters , including an additional @xmath95 phase . finally , the last term in this expression is a constant factor , independent of the distance travelled by the neutrino and its energy .",
    "therefore , any neutrino appearance experiment in the @xmath96 channel would be sensitive to this zero distance ( 0d ) contribution : @xmath97 there is a similar expression for the conversion probability in the @xmath98 channel . in this case",
    ", the oscillation probability formula is slightly more complicated , but at leading order in the non - unitary parameters , one can approximate the zero - distance appearance probability by the expression @xmath99    we have used these expressions to obtain direct constraints on the two parameters @xmath71 and @xmath81 using the negative searches from the nomad and chorus experiments . in the case of nomad  @xcite , the detector was located at 835 m from the neutrino target and reported limits on the search for @xmath100 oscillations in a predominantly @xmath101 neutrino beam produced by the sps at cern . on the other hand ,",
    "the chorus experiment  @xcite used the same beam at cern to search for @xmath102 oscillations .",
    "the relevant limits obtained from these experiments are the following : @xmath103 @xmath104    these are the only fully model - independent constraints .",
    "therefore , if we consider only bounds obtained from neutrino data one should take this information only , see lower part of table [ tab : bounds ] . concerning the parameter @xmath19 , to our knowledge , there are no direct constraints .",
    "the non - unitarity bounds derived by using all the relevant information discussed in this section , from universality to neutrino oscillation constraints are summarized in table [ tab : bounds ] .",
    "clearly , from the upper part of table  [ tab : bounds ] one can see that universality tests provide strong constraints on the diagonal parameters , @xmath105 , that are very close to unity , independently of the number of degrees of freedom considered .",
    "in addition , one can also use the relations in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cscond21 ] ) and  ( [ eq : cscond ] ) in order to obtain stronger constraints on the non - diagonal @xmath35 parameters . indeed , by combining universality bounds with these relations one finds that the constraints on the non - diagonal parameters are of order @xmath106 .",
    "however we note that these limits are all derived from charged current induced processes under the restrictive assumption that there is no new physics other than that of non - unitary mixing . as an example , the presence of neutrino - scalar yukawa interactions ( present in type ii seesaw schemes ) , or new right - handed interactions ( expected within a left - right symmetric seesaw ) would invalidate these bounds .",
    "hence these limits are somewhat fragile and may be invalidated by relatively mild and motivated departures from the underlying theory .",
    "in contrast , the constraints from neutrino experiments ( such as nomad and chorus ) provide a direct restriction on the non - diagonal @xmath35 parameters .",
    "these bounds are significantly less stringent , of the order of @xmath107 , and correspond to the lower entries in table  [ tab : bounds ] .    in short , at this stage",
    "one may adopt two approaches :    * to use the more restrictive bounds coming from charged current weak processes ( upper part of table [ tab : bounds ] ) * to use only bounds following strictly from the neutrino sector ( lower part of table [ tab : bounds ] ) .    while the limits on the @xmath35 parameters obtained from universality constraints are stronger , they are not robust enough for our purposes , so it would be reasonable to focus mainly on direct constraints coming from neutrino oscillation experiments , such as chorus and nomad .",
    "although this would justify a conservative approach of using only the lower table in order to evaluate the potential of the dune experiment in probing leptonic cp violation in the presence of seesaw - induced neutrino mass  @xcite , in our simulations for the dune experiment we include both conservative as well as model - dependent bounds , for comparison .",
    "the bottom line is that future oscillation experiments , like the upcoming dune experiment , have the potential of providing independent and robust probes of neutrino properties beyond standard oscillations , properties which can not be probed otherwise in a model - independent way .",
    "in @xcite we have given the analytic expressions for the neutrino oscillation probabilities in vacuum .",
    "this approach is valid to study oscillation experiments where matter effects are not very relevant .",
    "however , in order to obtain direct sensitivities on the non - unitarity of the lepton mixing matrix from upcoming long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments such as dune or no@xmath108a , one must have a consistent way to describe matter effects appropriate to this situation . in order to quantify the impact of non - unitary mixing in such experiments , where matter effects are expected to play an important role",
    ", one should take into account how the effective matter potential for neutrinos gets modified in the presence of non - unitary three - neutrino mixing .",
    "we discuss this issue in the next subsection .",
    "the standard derivation of the effective potential that neutrinos feel when traversing a material medium assumes unitary mixing between the light neutrino species  . in order to derive the neutrino potential in matter for a model with neutral heavy leptons ,",
    "we note that the complete expression for the neutrino in a flavor state will be given by @xmath109 with the @xmath35 subscript indicating flavor and @xmath110 mass eigenstates .",
    "charged current matter effects in neutrino propagation are illustrated in the feynman - like diagram in fig .",
    "( [ fig : feyn_cc ] ) and will be proportional to @xmath111 therefore , the charged current potential will be given by @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the number density of electrons in the medium and @xmath37 is the fermi constant .",
    "however , the heavy states will not take part in a long baseline neutrino oscillation set up . as a result",
    "the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nu_field_rel ] ) must be performed only up to the third mass eigenstate .",
