    "lattice simulations have provided clear evidence that , for @xmath9 , the temperature - driven `` transition '' between the first 2 regimes is actually a crossover  @xcite .",
    "then , the commonly expected @xmath10 phase diagram , depicted fig .  1 ( left ) , contains a critical point caused by the @xmath11 crossover turning into a first - order transition .",
    "this critical point is the object of both experimental search and theoretical lattice investigation .",
    "if located at small enough chemical potential , it could be discovered in high - energy , not - so - heavy ion collisions at rhic or lhc .",

    "@xcite , which consists of reweighting results obtained from @xmath11 simulations to @xmath14 , is known to fail and give wrong results without warning ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) when the overlap between the @xmath11 monte carlo ensemble and the target @xmath14 ensemble becomes insufficient .",
    "therefore , the abrupt change observed in @xcite as a function of @xmath1 ( see fig .  1 there ) might be caused by an abrupt breakdown of the numerical approach .",
    "in addition the needed reweighting factors to the @xmath14 target ensemble are not always positive , because of the notorious `` sign problem '' affecting the @xmath14 determinant .",
    "this makes the statistical errors more difficult to control .",
    "finally , the lattices used in @xcite have @xmath15 time - slices , corresponding to a very coarse lattice spacing @xmath16 fm .",
    "as acknowledged in @xcite already , the results may change considerably after extrapolation to the continuum limit @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the landmark result of @xcite should not be considered the final word on the qcd critical point .",
    "a more cautious crosscheck like the one we present here is warranted .    on the theoretical side , the expectation of a critical point as in fig .  1 ( left )",
    "can be traced back to two assumptions : @xmath18 qcd with @xmath19 massless flavours , at @xmath9 , has a second - order temperature - driven phase transition in the @xmath20 universality class  @xcite .",
    "this implies , for this theory , the existence of a tricritical point at @xmath21 , and for the @xmath22 theory that of another tricritical point at @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 these two tricritical points are analytically connected by a line in the @xmath25 space . however , assumption @xmath18 depends on the strength of the axial @xmath26 symmetry breaking at @xmath27 . and assumption @xmath24 has no other basis than simplicity .",
    "this motivates us to take a careful look at the phase diagram of @xmath22 qcd , generalized to arbitrary quark masses @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "to protect ourselves against the pitfalls of reweighting to @xmath14 , we consider the effect of an _ imaginary _ chemical potential @xmath36  @xcite",
    ". then the fermion determinant is positive and no overlap problem occurs because we do not reweight .",
    "the drawback is that , in order to analytically continue an observable , its @xmath1-dependence is fitted to low - order taylor series about @xmath11 , thus introducing a truncation error . as a safeguard",
    ", we also calculate the coefficients without truncations @xcite .",
    "note that these derivatives can be expressed , and measured , as non - local observables in the @xmath11 ensemble .",
    "this is the strategy pursued successfully in @xcite for the pressure .",
    "our approach is computationally more economical , and we extend it to the critical line .    the first step is to determine , at @xmath11 , the line in the @xmath37 plane for which the temperature - driven phase transition is second order . for lighter quarks , the transition becomes first order as in the chiral limit ; for heavier quarks , lattice simulations show a crossover .",
    "theoretical expectations are displayed in fig .  2 ( left ) .",
    "our determination of the critical line on an @xmath15 ( @xmath16 fm ) lattice is shown fig .  2 ( right ) , and matches expectations , including the possible scaling behaviour in the vicinity of a tricritical point at ( @xmath38 mev ) .",
    "also , the physical point ( with real - world @xmath39 and @xmath40 meson masses ) lies , as expected , in the crossover region .",
    "we now choose a point on the critical line just determined , and monitor the effect of a small @xmath1 .",
    "this exercise has been performed , with similar results , at the two points marked by arrows in fig .  2 ( right ) , with higher accuracy for the @xmath41 case . if conventional wisdom is right , then the surface spanned by the critical line as @xmath1 is turned on will bend towards the crossover region , so as to produce a critical point at some small @xmath1 value for physical quark masses .",
    "this is depicted fig .  3 ( left ) .",
    "on the contrary , an opposite curvature will indicate the absence of a critical point at small @xmath1 , where our truncated taylor expansion is a good approximation .",
    "this is illustrated fig .",
    "3 ( right ) .",
    "the issue is thus to determine whether the @xmath11 second order transition becomes first order or crossover for a small @xmath1 .",
    "we have now confirmed our first study  @xcite by a second one using higher statistics and an improved numerical method  @xcite .",
    "we measure the change in the binder cumulant @xmath42 , with @xmath43 . at the second order transition",
    ", @xmath44 takes the value 1.604 dictated by the @xmath45 ising universality class .",
    "reweighting with a small imaginary @xmath1 induces small changes in @xmath44 , which can be measured accurately because statistical errors largely cancel between the reweighted and original ensembles .",

    "the first step , at @xmath11 , already reveals an important shift of the critical line towards the origin : for the @xmath53 theory , the pion mass , measured at @xmath54 with the critical quark mass , decreases from @xmath55 to @xmath56  @xcite . as shown fig .  3",
    ", this considerably increases the distance of the critical surface to the physical point , pushing the critical point to larger @xmath1 ( left ) , or requiring larger higher - order terms of the right sign to bend the critical surface `` back '' ( right ) .",
