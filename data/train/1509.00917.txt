    "advances in nonlinear functional analysis and the rich theory of linear distributed parameter systems have led to a growing of body of work on nonlinear infinite - dimensional models .",
    "for instance , in a 2nd - order evolution framework ( especially , wave , elastodynamics , or thin plates with no rotational inertia terms ) for an appropriate elliptic operator @xmath6 a linear equation with viscous damping for an unknown @xmath7 may be expressed as @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "we will focus on the evolution on a bounded domain and under suitable homogeneous boundary conditions .",
    "a nonlinear refinement on the dissipative term may take the form of a feedback law @xmath10 .",
    "stability properties of such models have been extensively analyzed . in an infinite - dimensional sitting",
    "such a nonlinear feedback may change the topology of the problem and uniform stability becomes reliant on the regularity of solutions ( for example , see @xcite ) .    a more general scenario would account for coefficients that depend on the solution itself :",
    "@xmath11 assuming the well - posedness of an associated initial - boundary value problem can be resolved , if the term @xmath12 is not guaranteed to be strictly positive on a _ fixed _ appropriately configured set , then analysis of stability becomes much more involved since the region where the dissipation is active now evolves with the solution and may not always comply with the requirements of the geometric optics .",
    "the case when this coefficient vanishes at zero displacement , namely , @xmath13 , will be referred to as _ degenerate _ damping .",
    "such a degeneracy naturally arises when investigating energy decay of higher - order norms .",
    "for example , the natural energy space for a semilinear wave problem @xmath14 is @xmath15 and @xmath16 . with more regular initial data one can consider behavior of higher - order energy norms , namely for @xmath17 .",
    "one approach would be to differentiate the pde in time which via the substitution @xmath18 leads to a degenerately damped problem @xmath19 a particular example can be observed in the relation between maxwell s system and the ( vectorial ) wave equation . for a given medium",
    "denote the electric permittivity by @xmath20 , magnetic permeability by @xmath21 and conductivity by @xmath22 .",
    "then maxwell s system reads @xmath23 with @xmath24 . on a bounded domain ,",
    "subject to the _ electric wall _",
    "boundary conditions , and for scalar - valued @xmath21 , @xmath20 , @xmath22 with positive lower - bounds , the term @xmath25 exponentially stabilizes this system @xcite . in a more accurate nonlinear conduction model the coefficient @xmath22 may depend on the intensity of the electric field @xmath26 . if we consider , for example , @xmath27 for @xmath28 , then differentiating the first equation in time and combining with the equation for @xmath29 gives @xmath30 for example , taking , @xmath31 gives @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the normalized vector @xmath26 .",
    "the term @xmath34 has features of the viscous dissipation in this second - order equation , but nonlinear conductivity augments it with a degenerate coefficient @xmath35 .",
    "the study of stability for the above models is much more delicate than in the situations where the damping , even nonlinear , depends on the time - derivative only .",
    "weighted energy methods  from basic energy laws to carleman estimates ( e.g. @xcite)have been successfully used to derive stabilization and observability inequalities for distributed parameter systems . however",
    ", these methods typically rely on the properties of the coefficients to ensure that suitable geometric optics conditions are satisfied and the control effect suitably  propagated \" @xcite across the physical domain .",
    "one can sometimes dispense with geometric optics requirements for smooth enough initial data @xcite , yet even then the support of the control / damping term must contain a subset that is time - invariant ( and with any time - dependent coefficients being non - vanishing , e.g. , as in @xcite ) . in turn , the analysis of control - effect propagation when the coefficients themselves depend on the solution and possibly go to zero wherever and whenever the solution does would require new techniques .",
    "the following semilinear model , if recast in a higher - dimensional setting becomes highly non - trivial even when just regarding local wellposedness . in a one - dimensional framework",
    "the nonlinearity is more tractable , but the rigorous stability analysis has long been open .",
    "we focus on an elastic string with a _ degenerate damping _ , namely a dissipative term whose coefficient depends on and may vanish with the amplitudes : @xmath36 fixed at the end - points @xmath37 and with a prescribed initial configuration at @xmath38 : @xmath39 the initial data @xmath40 live in the natural function spaces revisited below .",
    "function @xmath41 is assumed to be continuous non - negative , hence the term @xmath42 a priori should provide some form of energy dissipation in the model .",
    "the scenario of interest is when @xmath43 as @xmath44 , essentially causing the dissipative effect to deteriorate at small amplitudes .",
    "we will focus on the polynomial case @xmath45 satisfying the locally lipschitz estimate @xmath46      existence and uniqueness of weak _ finite - energy _ solutions to was proven in @xcite by means of galerkin approximations .",
    "the advantage of a 1d framework is that the displacement function is absolutely continuous , hence topologically @xmath42 is still in @xmath47 , as in the case of the corresponding linear model .",
    "however , in higher - dimensional analogues this embedding property is lost and proving existence becomes a markedly more complex task .",
    "first , fractional damping exponents were considered in order to ensure that the damping term is bounded with respect to the finite energy topology @xcite .",
    "arbitrary damping exponents were subsequently examined in @xcite . due to",
    "the loss of regularity solutions had to be characterized via a variational _ inequality _ and established by a rather technical application of kakutani s fixed point theorem .",
    "on the other hand , stability analysis even in one dimension poses a challenge that has been open for a number of years . despite the gain in regularity , attributed to sobolev embeddings ,",
    "the key difficulty now is that energy estimates require some sort of information on the region where the damping is supported . in both the magnitude and the support of the damping coefficient",
    "evolve with the geometry of the state , rendering all standard techniques inapplicable .",
    "it is plausible to assume that some sort of a logarithmic uniform decay rate can be verified , possibly by combining ode techniques ( e.g. @xcite ) with pointwise carleman - type estimates .",
    "another , though a rather weak , tentative indication of this outcome would be the uniform stability of the corresponding finite - dimensional analogue ( see the appendix ) .",
    "yet the situation in infinite dimensions turns out rather different .",
    "the goal of this article is to examine analytically and numerically stability properties of the dynamical system associated to :    * establish global persistence of regularity in solutions with smooth initial data .",
    "besides theoretical interest such a result is useful to justify the convergence estimates for numerical approximations . *",
    "prove that a polynomial degeneracy in the damping of the form yields a system that is * not uniformly stable*. * present a numerical scheme that indicates the loss in decay rates .",
    "such observations had been performed first and , in fact , served as a motivation for the theoretical results presented here .",
    "the notation employed throughout the paper is summarized in section [ sec : notation ] .",
    "the two main results on well - posedness and stability are stated in section [ sec : main ] .",
    "several auxiliary technical definitions used in the proofs can be found in section [ sec : aux ] .",
    "local and global wellposedness are verified respectively in sections [ sec : local ] and [ sec : global ] .",
    "they draw upon two regularity lemmas proved earlier in section [ sec : regularity ] .",
    "the proof of the lack of uniform stability is the subject of section [ sec : nonuniform ] .",
    "numerical results are the subject of section [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "the appendix contains results pertaining to the ode analog of the considered problem , namely , a damped harmonic oscillator with the damping coefficient dependent on the displacement .",
    "this section serves as a quick reference for the basic notation used thorough the paper with some of the symbols revisited and discussed in more detail later in the text .",
