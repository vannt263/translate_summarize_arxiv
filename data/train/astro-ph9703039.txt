    "clusters of galaxies are the largest relaxed systems in the universe and as such provide a strong test of theories of the origin of and evolution of structure .",
    "a critical measurement ( @xcite ) is the relationship of the mass of a system to its temperature .",
    "this can be best probed by comparing the evolution of the x - ray luminosity ( which is related to the baryonic mass ) to the x - ray temperature , which is roughly proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "calculations of the evolution of these quantities ( c.f .",
    ",  @xcite , @xcite ) indicate that , in a closed universe , where gravity dominates the evolution of the gas and the dark matter , the relationship between luminosity and temperature should evolve strongly at all redshifts , with significant changes occurring at @xmath3",
    ". however the nature and amplitude of the evolution is dependent on the details of the cosmological model ( @xcite ) .",
    "for example , evolution is less in the cdm+ @xmath4=1 model than in a pure cdm universe and is also less in a low density universe , or one in which the entropy of the gas is relatively large at high redshift ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this evolution is not necessarily monotonic .",
    "cen & ostriker ( 1994 ) show that in a cdm+@xmath4=1 model there is an almost constant mean cluster temperature from @xmath5 to the present while in a cdm model there is a sharp decrease in the temperature from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .    at low redshift",
    "the l - t relation is well measured ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "while the correlation is good , there is a fair degree of scatter ( @xcite ) , with cooling flow clusters being rather more luminous for a given temperature . the theoretical prediction for the relationship between luminosity and temperature in a cdm universe dominated by gravity (",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) is somewhat flatter than observed .",
    "there are various possible explanations for this such as systematic variations in the baryonic fraction with cluster mass ( @xcite ) or pre - heating ( @xcite ) .    at low redshifts the relationship between the cluster velocity dispersion ( @xmath8)and the gas temperature",
    "( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) is very tight , consistent with both tracing the same potential .",
    "this strong agreement is not generally predicted to continue at higher redshift .",
    "asca data allow , for the first time , a measurement of the l - t and the @xmath8-t relationships at @xmath9 from a large sample of clusters . thereby placing strong constraints on theories of cluster evolution . in this paper",
    "we use a sample of 38 clusters of galaxies from @xmath10 obtained from the asca archives .",
    "this sample , while not homogeneously chosen , is large enough to constrain this relationship at @xmath11    the only previous attempt to measure the l - t relationship at @xmath9 ( @xcite ) was consistent with no evolution , but with rather large errors .",
    "however , this study relied on summing a large number of low signal to noise data sets from the flux limited einstein medium survey and was therefore fundamentally different in character .",
    "the asca data have well determined temperatures for each cluster but are drawn from a heterogeneous sample .",
    "we have extracted the spectra from 38 clusters of galaxies at @xmath0 from the asca archive ( table 1 ) .",
    "the sample simply consists of all clusters available before nov .",
    "1996 for which the data are publicly available , the temperature uncertainty is @xmath12 , and there is no strong substructure visible in the asca image . in our analysis",
    "we allowed the cluster abundance and galactic absorption to be free parameters . for clusters at @xmath5",
    "this effectively requires cluster flux @xmath13 @xmath14 ergs @xmath15 .",
    "examination of the data ( figure 1 ) shows a relatively strong selection bias against clusters of @xmath16erg s@xmath17 at @xmath18 .",
    "this comes from the desire of many of the proposers to obtain higher quality spectra , requiring bright sources and/or longer exposures than normal with asca , combined with the relatively small number of known clusters in this luminosity / redshift range .    at @xmath19 clusters of @xmath16",
    "are below the threshold of the rosat all sky survey and mainly come from the emss data base ( @xcite ) and serendipitous rosat sources . at flux levels",
    "@xmath20erg s@xmath17@xmath15 the asca data analysis is relatively straightforward ( see  @xcite for a discussion of the higher signal to noise objects in this sample ) .",
    "we have used the latest calibrations including the gain change in the sis detectors .    quoted errors are 90% confidence for one parameter ( @xmath21 + 2.71 ) .",
    "we use @xmath22 and @xmath23 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 in this paper .",
    "our derived temperatures agree very well with those obtained by  @xcite , for common objects and the previously published results of  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we have integrated the spectra over 3 - 6 arcmin in radius , depending on cluster redshift , in an attempt to get the average spectrum in a fashion similar to those obtained by non - imaging proportional counters for lower redshift objects . thus our values are directly comparable to those of the non - imaging experiments .",
    "the effects of cooling flows ( @xcite ) , mergers ( @xcite ) or non - isothermal profiles ( @xcite ) can change the mean temperature by up to @xmath2420% .",
    "for example , in a1835 which has a very large cooling flow , the mean kt=8.15 kev ( table 1 and  @xcite ) changes to 9.5 kev with the inclusion of a cooling flow in the spectral fit .",
    "the uncertainties in the temperature for these high @xmath25 systems are similar to or less than the errors obtained from exosat ( @xcite ) , heao-1 ( @xcite ) or the einstein mpc ( @xcite ) proportional counters , and thus form a good comparison sample .",
    "we have added a few low @xmath25 clusters to the david et al ( 1993 ) compilation ( a3158 and a3581 ) and obtained accurate asca temperatures from our own analysis and the literature for those low @xmath25 clusters with large temperature uncertainties in the david et al ( 1993 ) compilation ( a399 , a401 , a3112 and a3391 ) to obtain an essentially flux limited low @xmath25 sample resulting in a total sample of 102 clusters from @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "comparison of this sample ( @xmath0 ) with the enhanced david et al ( 1993 ) sample of low redshift clusters ( @xmath28 ) shows no evidence for a change in the l - t relationship ( figure 1 ) over the whole luminosity range covered ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "however the asca data show a strong bias at the low luminosity end of the distribution due to the absence of objects in the database .",
    "we believe this selection effect accounts for the apparent flattening of the l - t relationship for the high @xmath25 clusters at low luminosities ( figure 1 ) .",
    "thus we restrict our analysis to @xmath30 for which there are no strong selection effects and for which there is maximum overlap of the low and high @xmath25 data sets and a reasonable set of objects ( 39 ) . applying the two dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov test",
    "we find that at @xmath30 the low and high @xmath25 data show no evidence of being significantly different ( probability of being different @xmath31% for all high / low redshift divisions ) .",
    "the inclusion of the lowest luminosity points , combined with a smaller data set led tsuru et al ( 1994 ) to infer a change in the l - t relation which is not seen in the present data .    the high @xmath25 , large accretion rate , cooling flow clusters in figure 1 ( e.g. rxj1347 , a1835 , emss1455 occupy a ridge line to the right in the l - t plot .",
    "this property was noted in the low @xmath25 sample by fabian et al ( 1994 ) .",
    "we estimate the allowed change in either the normalization or slope of this relation by examining the variation in the mean temperature in redshift shells . in figure 2",
    "the mean cluster temperatures determined by maximum likelihood are plotted as a function of redshift bin .",
    "much of the plotted allowed range in the mean temperature is not due to uncertainties in the data but to real width in the l - t relation , as seen in the low @xmath25 sample ( figure 1 and  @xcite ) .",
    "solid vertical error bars represent the 90% confidence limits on @xmath32 , dotted error bars indicate the intrinsic dispersion of the @xmath33-@xmath34 distribution estimated by likelihood analysis .",
    "using @xmath35 gives a small but significant change in the normalization , such that higher redshift clusters are less luminous for a given temperature .",
    "the limits on temperature evolution are estimated from figure 2 as : @xmath36 for @xmath37 at fixed luminosity .",
    "we also compare the relationship of velocity dispersion to temperature and luminosity , using the large sample of fadda et al ( 1996 ) for the low @xmath25 sample and the carlberg et al ( 1996 ) and fabbricant et al ( 1991 ) data for the high @xmath25 sample .",
    "we find that the high @xmath25 clusters in the temperature range 4 - 9 kev show virtually identical @xmath8-t and @xmath8-l relationships to those of the low @xmath25 sample ( figure 3 ) . ac118 and a1689 are clearly discrepant , indicating non - virial velocity dispersion .",
    "the lack of evolution in the l - t relation at @xmath3 combined with the recent upper limits on the evolution of the luminosity function over the same redshift range places strong constraints on all models of cluster evolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "as pointed out in detail by navarro , frenk and white ( 1995 ) a model in which the intial specific entropy is large results in little , if any , evolution in the l - t plane and better matches the overall slope of the observed l - t relation .",
    "metzler and evrard ( 1994 ) describe a model in which entropy due to the creation of the metals is explicitly included , increasing the overall entropy of a kt@xmath38 6 kev cluster by a factor of 2 and producing a value of the entropy that agrees well with that of several nearby clusters .",
    "this result is sensitive to the thermalization of the supernova shock energy .",
    "however , as david et al ( 1996 ) point out , the central entropy does vary from cluster to cluster , in agreement with the scatter in the l - t plot .",
    "bower ( 1997 ) has parameterized the evolution of cluster central gas entropy as a power of the expansion factor : @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is specific heat capacity of the gas at constant volume ) . in this case",
    "@xmath41 corresponds to constant entropy .",
    "data on the evolution of the cluster xlf and l - t relationships can then be used to constrain two parameters ; @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the power spectrum index of matter density fluctuations ( @xcite ) .",
    "our results imply that over the redshift range @xmath44 , @xmath45 . if the evolution of the icm followed that of the dark matter ( e.g.  @xcite ) then our limits on @xmath42 would imply @xmath46 always , thereby firmly ruling out self - similar evolution of clusters .",
    "if there is little or no evolution in the xlf ( e.g.  @xcite ) then our result implies that @xmath47 .",
    "recent measurements of the low luminosity cluster population at high redshift ( @xcite ) are also consistent with zero evolution in the xlf .    bryan ( 1996 )",
    "presents a scaling relation between l@xmath48 and t with a @xmath49 dependence for @xmath50 .",
    "the dashed curve in figure 2 represents this scaling , normalised to the luminosity band used here .",
    "clearly the bryan model can not be rejected , although it does not appear to describe the data particularly well .",
    "the same statement can be made about the results of kitayama and suto ( 1996 ) who have improved on press - schechter theory by including the epoch of cluster formation , and predict a similar ( negative ) temperature evolution .",
    "the lack of evolution in the @xmath8-t relation also indicates that the gas and the galaxies are sampling the same potential ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) and that both change in the same way with redshift , a result not generally expected in many models .",
    "presumably a similar lack of evolution would be seen in low density universe models in which cluster evolution occurs early and structure stops forming at @xmath51 . however , detailed calculations for such models are not yet available .",
    "we find no evolution in the cluster l - t relation as a function of redshift .",
    "these results are consistent with models in which the cluster core acquired a high initial entropy ( @xcite ) as required by the recent determination of the origin of the cluster metals ( @xcite ) and the lack of evolution in the cluster metallicity ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is likely that this result is also consistent with low density cosmologies in which clusters stop evolving at relatively high redshifts , or other variants of the standard models .",
    "we hope that this large data set will enourage detailed theoretical modeling .",
    "we thank y. tanaka for early encouragement of this project .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center .",
