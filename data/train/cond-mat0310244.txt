    "recent discovery of superconductivity in the cobaltate na@xmath2coo@xmath3h@xmath4o , @xmath5 with a critical temperature of @xmath6 @xcite has attracted enormous attention to this material , stimulating a large number of experimental @xcite and theoretical investigations @xcite .",
    "na@xmath2coo@xmath3h@xmath4o is of space group p6@xmath7/mmc , representing a hexagonal layered structure which consists of two - dimensional ( 2d ) coo@xmath4 conduction planes , separated by h@xmath4o and na@xmath8 ions .",
    "the material is derived from its parent compound naco@xmath4o@xmath9 , equivalent to @xmath10=0.5 , by simultaneous intercalation of h@xmath4o and deintercalation of na@xmath8 ions .",
    "this process nearly doubles the c - axis lattice - constant , strongly enhancing the 2d character of the compound .",
    "the co ions form a _ triangular _ lattice and are coordinated by edge - sharing oxygen - octahedra which display a shift of the oxygen atoms along the @xmath11-direction . in this environment",
    "the low - lying @xmath12-manifold splits into a non - degenerate @xmath13 level and an @xmath14-doublet , leaving co@xmath15 in a low - spin , @xmath16=1/2 state , with a single electron in the @xmath13 level while co@xmath17 has a filled @xmath13 orbital @xcite . in turn",
    ", @xmath10 can be viewed as _ electron doping _",
    "away from half - filling of a non - degenerate one - band model on a triangular lattice , with na@xmath2coo@xmath3h@xmath4o , @xmath5 refering to an electron density of @xmath18 per site .    at present , the electronic structure of the cobaltates is an open issue . yet , there is a tempting similarity to the high - temperature superconducting cuprates , where however @xmath19-holes are arranged on a 2d _ square_-lattice .",
    "early on , the role of electron correlations in the cobaltates has been of interest .",
    "lda results in an @xmath13 bandwidth of @xmath201 - 1.4ev , while the @xmath19-shell coulomb - correlation strength @xmath0 is of order 5 - 8ev typically @xcite .",
    "motivated by this , resonating - valence - bond ( rvb)@xcite scenarios have been pursued by several researchers @xcite . in addition , weak - coupling calculations , using renormalization - group ( rg ) methods have also been performed @xcite . in this paper",
    "we apply an alternative method , suitable for intermediate correlation strength , namely the fluctuation - exchange - approximation ( flex ) @xcite and investigate the spin- and charge - dynamics in the triangular hubbard - model . in passing ,",
    "we note that such analysis may also shed light onto the organic superconductors @xmath21-(et)@xmath4x @xcite .",
    "these have been suggested to realize the hubbard - model on an _ anisotropic _ triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ method ] we discuss the model and briefly review the flex method . in section [ results ] results for the renormalized dispersions , fermi surfaces , the static spin structure factor , and the frequency dependence of the selfenergy are discussed for several dopings .",
    "our subsequent analysis is focussed on the normal state properties of the one - band hubbard - model on the triangular lattice    @xmath22    due to the lack of electron - hole symmetry , a choice has to be made to fix the sign of the the hopping matrix elements @xmath23 and the coulomb repulsion @xmath0 .",
    "here we fix these parameters to model the electronic structure of na@xmath2coo@xmath3h@xmath4o which we assume to be similar to the one of the parent compound .",
    "lda calculations on naco@xmath4o@xmath9 @xcite place the fermi energy in a cef - split @xmath12 manifold of co @xmath19-bands with the states near the fermi energy @xmath24 to be of @xmath25 symmetry . due to a weak unit - cell doubling a bilayer-type splitting exists which we will neglected henceforth .",

    "coulomb - correlations however , suppress double occupancy of the @xmath25-@xmath12 level by holes . therefore , for the remainder of this paper we switch to the hole - language , implying @xmath28 and @xmath29 . the corresponding tight - binding band and bare dos , as well as the fermi surface ( fs ) and chemical potential for @xmath30 are shown in fig",

    "second , the lda fs for the parent compound naco@xmath4o@xmath9 , i.e. at @xmath32=0.5 , is notably hexagonal , while the tight - binding fs using n.n .- hopping only is practically circular at this doping .",
    "these facts signal a sizeable next - nearest - neighbor(n.n.n . ) hopping @xmath33 in the cobaltates .",

    "the fs at finite and negative @xmath39 is hexagonally shaped for @xmath76 down to the sc s doping level .",
    "this is consistent with the lda results of ref .",

    "the half width of the commensurate spin fluctuation peak for @xmath77 and @xmath37 is scetched by the circle on the right hand side of the inner fs in fig .",
    "this circle is also a measure for the degree of nesting of the quasi - parallel regions of the fermi surface . at @xmath77 ,",
    "close to the sc s doping level , the commensurate peak is @xmath8960% larger for @xmath39 than for @xmath37 . at @xmath84 however , where the nesting properties of the @xmath73 and @xmath74 models are rather reversed , the spin response is less supressed for @xmath37 .    in fig .",

    "in contrast to the situation at @xmath77 we have found the incommensurate spin fluctuation peaks at @xmath84 to be enhanced only weakly with @xmath0 increasing up to @xmath70 .",

    "the lattice momenta are chosen as close as possible to the fs .",
    "we find the selfenergy to be nearly isotropic along the fs with only a rather weak maximum occuring in the direction of the commensurate spin fluctuations . near the fermi energy and for _ all _ dopings shown , the selfenergy is clearly proportional to @xmath95 at low - energies which is indicative of normal fermi - liquid behavior .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to flex analysis of the hubbard - model on the _ square lattice _",
    ", close to half filling .",
    "there one typically finds marginal fermi - liquid behavior with im@xmath96 over a wide range of frequencies @xcite .",
    "therefore , along this line one is tempted to conclude , that the normal state of the cobaltates is more of conventional metallic nature than in the cuprates .",
    "this is even more so , if one realizes from fig .",
    "[ ims_w ] that the quasi - particle scattering rate displays its smallest curvature at the sc s doping level , which implies the quasi - particles to be rather well defined there . at larger values of @xmath64 ,",
    "proximity of the fs to the van hove singularities enhance both , the absolute value of im@xmath92 as well as the curvature .",
    "this effect is more pronounced for @xmath37 .",
    "in summary we have investigated the one - band hubbard - model on a triangular lattice with nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor hopping using the normal state version of the flex approximation .",
    "adapting this model to the cobaltates we have shown that a sizeable next - nearest - neighbor hopping is necessary to describe their electronic structure . over a substantial range of dopings",
    "which we have investigated we find a significant fermi surface mass - enhancement of order unity .",
