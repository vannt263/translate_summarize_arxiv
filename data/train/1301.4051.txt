    "the idea of extension of noncommutativity to the coordinates was first suggested by heisenberg as a possible solution for removing the infinite quantities of field theories before the renormalization procedure was developed and had gained acceptance .",
    "they seem to have first appeared in a letter from heisenberg to peierls in 1930  @xcite .",
    "the first paper on the subject was published in 1947 by hartland snyder who sought to use it to regularize quantum field theories  @xcite .",
    "the success of renormalization theory however drained interest from the subject for some time .",
    "+ the renewed interest by particle physics community started to grow after the paper by seiberg and witten @xcite .",
    "arguments combining quantum uncertainties with classical gravity also provide an alternative motivation for their study @xcite , and these theories can provide a self - consistent deformation of ordinary quantum field theories at small distances , yielding non - locality @xcite , or create a framework for finite truncation of quantum field theories while preserving symmetries @xcite . also , the emergence of noncommutative field theories in string theory @xcite has provided a considerable impetus to their investigation",
    ".    the noncommutativity of the coordinates can be described by the following commutation relation @xmath6=i\\theta_{\\mu\\nu}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is an anti - symmetric tensor .",
    "the simplest case corresponds to @xmath7 being constant .",
    "the field theories on such spacetimes are described by elements of unital algebra ( associative , but not commutative ) generated by @xmath8 s .",
    "there is a sense in which the algebra over the noncommutative space @xmath9 and the algebra over commutative space @xmath10 ( @xmath11 being the dimension of the space ) have the same topology .",
    "this algebra can be considered as a deformation of the algebra over @xmath10 such that the elements of the algebra have the same addition law , but a different ( noncommutative ) multiplication law which reduces to the commutative point - wise multiplication in the limit @xmath12 .",
    "this noncommutative multiplication law is often denoted by @xmath13 or _ the star product _ to distinguish it from the ordinary pointwise multiplication of functions .",
    "let us give an example of such star product .",
    "if we denote by @xmath14 the pointwise multiplication map @xmath15 then the star product is generally given by @xmath16 for instance , @xmath17 corresponding to the moyal product is given by @xmath18 one can easily check that the following is satisfied : @xmath19_\\star = x_\\mu\\star x_\\nu - x_\\nu\\star x_\\mu = i\\theta_{\\mu\\nu}.\\ ] ]      noncommutativity of the spacetime coordinates apparently conflicts with poincar invariance , as one can see in ( [ basic_comm ] ) .",

    "this modification in coproduct changes the standard hopf algebra structure associated with the poincar group ( the poincar - hopf algebra ) to the twisted poincar - hopf algebra .",

    "there are kinds of noncommutative spaces other than the moyal space .",
    "in particular , we study the thermodynamics in the so - called doubly / deformed special relativistic ( dsr ) theories which are related to a noncommutative space known as @xmath1-minkowski space @xcite .",
    "dsr ( doubly / deformed special relativity ) aims to search for an alternate relativistic theory which keeps a length / energy scale ( the planck scale ) and a velocity scale ( the speed of light scale ) invariant .",
    "attempts to combine gravity with quantum mechanics in search of the theory for quantum gravity always seem to give rise to the planck length @xmath29 that provides the scale at which the quantum effects of gravity will show up @xcite .",
    "the existence of such a length scale is in conflict with the equivalence principle because observers in different inertial frames will not agree on @xmath30 due to the lorentz - fitzgerald contraction . to understand in a better way consider the following : if the planck scale is to play the role of the threshold for the discrete spacetime , it may come in the quantities involving the metric ( for example the action ) . for equivalence principle to hold ,",
    "i.e. , for physics to be independent of the inertial frames the action and hence the planck scale has to remain invariant under the relativistic transformation .",
    "it has been shown that it is possible to still have equivalence principle by deforming special relativity ( sr ) .",
    "these classes of theories fall under the name doubly / deformed special relativity ( dsr ) @xcite . in dsr , apart from the constancy of speed - of - light scale , the planck length @xmath30 or equivalently planck energy @xmath1 is also constant under coordinate transformation from one inertial frame to another .",
    "it was first proposed by g. amelino - camelia @xcite . to proceed",
    "one can take lessons from the transition from galilean to lorentz transformations .",
    "the galilean transformation is linear in velocity and hence it does not keep any velocity scale invariant . to have an invariant velocity scale we needed to accept the lorentz transformation which is nonlinear in velocity .",
    "thus if one wants to have planck length / energy scale invariant the relativistic transformation has to be nonlinear in position / momentum space .",
    "one also keep in mind the possibility of the symmetry group being different from the usual lorentz group .",
    "this symmetry group must act nonlinearly in the position / momentum space representation to keep planck length / energy invariant . in the special relativistic limit , planck length / energy @xmath31",
    "the symmetry group has to go to the lorentz group .",
    "j. magueijo and l. smolin have argued that the symmetry group for the dsr transformations remains to be the lorentz group @xcite .",

    "they have also suggested the following nonlinear representation of the lorentz transformation on momentum space @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "the above transformation corresponds to the boost along @xmath34-axis . note that they also satisfy the group multiplication law of the usual lorentz group , i.e. , @xmath35 the transformation keeps the following mass invariant @xmath36 we call it the _ invariant mass_. note that",

    "<S> we then shift to the so - called dsr theories which are related to a different kind of noncommutative ( @xmath1-minkowski ) space . </S>",
    "<S> dsr ( doubly / deformed special relativity ) aims to search for an alternate relativistic theory which keeps a length / energy scale ( the planck scale ) and a velocity scale ( the speed of light scale ) invariant . </S>",
    "<S> we study thermodynamics of an ideal gas in such a scenario . _    in first chapter we introduce the subjects of the noncommutative quantum theories and the dsr </S>",
    "<S> . chapter [ instanton ] starts with describing the gbos . </S>",
    "<S> they correspond to reducible representations of the harmonic oscillator algebra . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate their relevance in the construction of topologically non - trivial solutions in noncommutative gauge theories , focusing our attention to flux tubes , vortices , and instantons . </S>",
    "<S> our method provides a simple new relation between the topological charge and the number of times the basic irreducible representation occurs in the reducible representation underlying the gbo . when used in conjunction with the noncommutative adhm construction , we find that these new instantons are in general not unitarily equivalent to the ones currently known in literature </S>",
    "<S> .    chapter [ qo ] studies the time dependent transitions of quantum forced harmonic oscillator ( qfho ) in noncommutative @xmath2 perturbatively to linear order in the noncommutativity @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the poisson distribution gets modified , and that the vacuum state evolves into a `` squeezed '' state rather than a coherent state . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolutions of uncertainties in position and momentum in vacuum are also studied and imply interesting consequences for modelling nonlinear phenomena in quantum optics .    </S>",
    "<S> in chapter [ dsr ] we study thermodynamics of an ideal gas in doubly special relativity . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a series solution for the partition function and derive thermodynamic quantities . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that dsr thermodynamics is non - perturbative in the sr and massless limits . </S>",
    "<S> a stiffer equation of state is found . </S>",
