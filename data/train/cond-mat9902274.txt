    "due to its various applications in non - linear optics and electro - optics , the ferroelectric material linbo@xmath0 is being extensively studied over decades .",
    "its ferroelectric transition temperature of 1480 k is among the highest known to date .",
    "the mechanism of the structural phase transition from paraelectric to ferroelectric phase is still an open question .",
    "temperature dependence measurements of raman scattering @xcite and far infrared reflectivity in linbo@xmath0 @xcite suggest the displacive type phase transition . in contradiction with this picture ,",
    "the absence of the @xmath3 mode softening reported in certain papers @xcite is an indication towards an order - disorder type phase transition .",
    "the study of the electronic structure and lattice dynamics from first principles was so far hindered by the relative complexity of the structure . in the ferroelectric phase",
    ", linbo@xmath0 has 10 atoms in the unit cell ; the space group is @xmath5 .",
    "the atomic arrangement is given by oxygen octahedra stapled along the polar trigonal axis .",
    "each nb atoms is displaced from the center of the oxygen octahedron along the polar axis ; the next octahedron ( along the polar axis ) is empty , and the following one contains a li atom , displaced from the oxygen face along the trigonal axis . in the paraelectric phase ,",
    "the space group of linbo@xmath0 is @xmath7 . in this case , the nb atoms are centered inside the oxygen octahedra , and the li atoms lie inside the common face of two adjacent oxygen octahedra @xcite . the primitive cell and its internal parameters are shown in fig .  [ fig : struct ] .",
    "inbar and cohen @xcite calculated from first principles the total energy profile associated with the ferroelectric instability .",
    "they have shown that a broadly spread assumption about the instability being primarily related to the li displacement out of oxygen layers was not justified .",
    "in addition to the li displacement , the shift ( with respect to nb ) and distortion of the oxygen octahedra play quite a crucial role and lower the total energy much more efficiently .",
    "these results have been essentially reproduced by yu and park @xcite . in these previous studies ,",
    "the ferroelectric distortion has been simulated by an uniform scaling of the crystal structure along the linear path between experimentally determined paraelectric and ferroelectric structures . in the present work ,",
    "we fully optimize the structure of paraelectric and ferroelectric phases from first principles , adjusting the values of all internal parameters constrained only by the crystal symmetry .",
    "in the course of that , the energetics of individual atomic displacements can be analyzed and applied for the zone - center lattice dynamics simulation within the frozen - phonon scheme . with such simulation so far missing ,",
    "the attribution of different experimentally measured zone - center phonon modes ( with respect to atomic displacement patterns ) was problematic .",
    "the extraction of normal vibration coordinates in linbo@xmath0 , done in the present work , may be useful for the development of reliable lattice dynamics models in this system , including , e.g. , the effects of doping .",
    "the calculations were performed using the full potential linear augmented plane wave method ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) with the addition of local orbital basis functions @xcite as implemented in wien97 flapw code @xcite .",
    "the exchange - correlation was treated within the local density approximation ( lda ) , using the parametrization by perdew and wang @xcite .",
    "the core states were treated fully relativistically , and the semicore and valence states were computed in a scalar relativistic approximation .",
    "the structure optimization in the para- and ferroelectric phase and the frozen phonon calculations were performed using a @xmath8 special @xmath9-points mesh which generated 20 @xmath9 points in the irreducible brillouin zone .",
    "we tested the convergence in the @xmath9-space integration using a @xmath10 @xmath9-mesh ( 28 irreducible k - points ) and found the difference in the total energy trends , as compared with the results on a sparser @xmath9-mesh , negligible for the analysis of lattice dynamics and structure optimization .",
    "the muffin tin radii chosen were 1.9 a.u .",
    "for nb and 1.6 a.u . for li and o , close to the values used by inbar and cohen @xcite in their flapw calculation .",
    "the convergency of the results with respect to the number of augmented plane waves used was also controlled ; we used , on the average , 980 basis functions for each @xmath9-point .",

    "@xcite ) , that corresponds to a volume underestimated by @xmath22 and a @xmath1 ratio deviating by @xmath232% from experiment , i.e. quite good agreement by the standards of first - principles calculations based on the density functional theory . in the subsequent optimization of atomic positions",
    ", we kept the lattice parameters fixed .",
    "the fully optimized paraelectric structure was found energetically instable with respect to the symmetry - lowering atom displacements .",
    "the paraelectric phase has one internal coordinate whereas the ferroelectric phase has four .",
    "these four parameters are actually related to the four symmetry coordinates which can be introduced to describe the @xmath3-to phonons .",
    "therefore , in the course of accumulating total energy data for our frozen phonon calculations ( see next section ) , we were able simultaneously to optimize the ferroelectric ground - state structure to quite good accuracy",
    ". moreover , the calculated forces have been used in the process of structure optimization . the experimental and calculated atomic positions ( in the hexagonal coordinates , following @xcite ) for both paraelectric and ferroelectric phases are given in table  [ tab : struc ] .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment in all internal parameters is quite good , indicating a presumably nonproblematic applicability of lda for the study of lattice dynamics in linbo@xmath0 .",
    "the energy difference we found between paraelectric and ferroelectric phases is essentially the same as determined by inbar and cohen @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-to frequencies in the ferroelectric structure are split by symmetry into four @xmath3 , five @xmath4 and nine @xmath24 modes .",
    "the frequencies of @xmath3 modes have been determined in a number of raman spectroscopy measurements , with a satisfactory agreement of results @xcite .",
    "the displacement patterns corresponding to different modes have not yet been unambiguously attributed , to our best knowledge . some information to that point has been attained , however , based on a study of the isotope effect in ref .",
    "@xcite , that is addressed below .",
    "the @xmath4 modes are both raman and infrared silent .",
    "our calculation data are therefore predictive with respect to these vibrations .",
    "the nine @xmath24 modes are the source of the largest controversy in the experimental study of vibrations in linbo@xmath0 .",
    "they are attributed differently in a number of publications .",
    "the discussion on this controversy can be found , e.g. , in ref .",
    "the first - principles description of @xmath24 modes remains beyond the scope of the present study .",
    ".calculated and measured frequencies ( @xmath25 ) of four @xmath3-to modes in linbo@xmath0 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : evec_a2 ]    for the @xmath4 modes , no experimental information is available by means of raman nor infrared spectroscopy , so our results are actually a theory prediction .",
    "we used 127 different geometries to obtain an accurate second - order total energy fit in the 5-dimensional space of symmetry coordinates",
    ". calculated frequencies and eigenvectors are shown in table  [ tab : evec_a2 ] .",
    "note that in contrast to @xmath3 modes , both nb and both li atoms are now moving in antiphase . apart from the softest mode which includes essentially the nb vs. li antiphase @xmath26-movement , and the hardest one , which is again a distortion of oxygen octahedra ( but now including the @xmath26-stretching as well ) , three intermediate modes are have contributions from @xmath26- as well as @xmath27-displacements of all three atomic constituents .    summarizing , we performed from first principles in a lda - based calculation the optimization of the ground structure of ferroelectric linbo@xmath0 and calculated the frequencies and eigenvectors of @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xmath2-to modes .",
    "large anharmonic contributions were found for two of four @xmath3 modes .",
    "these results may present a basis for a subsequent treatment of lattice dynamics models in related systems and/or of anharmonic effects .",
    "the study of @xmath24 modes is now in progress .",
