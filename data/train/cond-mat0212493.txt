    "the renormalization group ( rg ) approach , in its most enlightening formulation due to wilson @xcite , is the theory designed to handle fields ( quantum or classical ) fluctuating over range of momentum ( energy ) scales . in the momentum - space formulation ,",
    "this range of scales where fluctuations matter is bounded by some initial ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff @xmath0 ( not necessarily finite ) provided by the problem under consideration , and @xmath0 is the scale where the rg procedure of the successive mode integration starts . for the most problems where rg was successfully applied ( e.g.",
    ", phase transition , field theories ) the low - energy sector of interest resides near one point of the momentum space which can always be mapped to the origin of that space .    in practical loopwise calculations , the original wk infinitesimal scheme seems however to appear too involved beyond one - loop level , and , e.g. , for the wilson s original problem of phase transition in higher orders various field - theoretic rg approaches were applied @xcite . in field theory the cutoff @xmath0 is essentially considered as a `` troublesome '' parameter to get rid of , either by eventually taking the limit @xmath1 , or , e.g , by using another regularization scheme , like the dimensional one where the cutoff is set to infinity from the start .",
    "contrary to the wk scheme , which specifically stipulates that at each rg step the momenta to be integrated out lie within infinitesimally narrow shell in the momentum space , in the field - theoretic rg only overall momentum conservation is taken care of , while separate momenta may lie outside of the ( hyper)sphere of radius @xmath2 ( centered at the origin ) .",
    "this situation is well known , and contributions from the states lying outside of the action s phase space at the distance of several radii @xmath2 or , in other terms , violating phase space constraints by @xmath3 do not affect the leading terms of the rg flow .",
    "however , in condensed matter problems the wilsonian _ effective action s scale _",
    "@xmath0 must be taken seriously . _",
    "a priori _ it can not be set to infinity or even to the largest scale provided by the underlying microscopics , i.e. , inverse lattice , interatomic , etc , spacing . even for a problem",
    "with the low - energy sector localized near the origin of the momentum space , aforementioned violations of the phase space constraints result in double counting of the degrees of freedom lying outside of the wilsonian phase space ( i.e. , the degrees of freedom which are already `` integrated out '' in some way before we reached the wilsonian scale from the microscopic scale ) .",
    "this can affect the next - to - leading terms , as well as finite renormalizations of the action s parameters .",
    "for the important problem of fermions having a fermi surface  that is a low - energy sector residing near a manifold in the momentum space  accounting for the modes within the phase space _ only _ during the rg procedure becomes a rather non - trivial task , as was explained by shankar @xcite .",
    "moreover , the error of violating the phase space constraints can be of order @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is some characteristic size of the fermi surface , even if the low - energy modes we are integrating out reside within a narrow shell @xmath6 .",
    "note that the answers for many of the most interesting problems of the condensed - matter fermions lie in calculating the abovementioned `` next - to - leading terms '' , where the differences between various rg approaches matter .",
    "for instance , the problem of the fermi - liquid vs non - fermi - liquid regimes of the normal state of the cuprates , from an rg point of view is the difference in the behavior of the irrelevant ( self - energy ) terms in both regimes .",
    "so the choice of the optimal rg scheme and the control over the subleading terms are the issues far from being academical .",
    "the main claim we want to make from the considerations of this paper is that for a condensed - matter problem cast in terms of the wilsonian effective action with a physically meaningful uv cutoff @xmath0 , the wk rg provides the only scheme definitely reliable in all orders of the loopwise expansions , where all modes from the phase space are integrated once and only once .",
    "( strictly speaking , there are no new results in the rg equations we derive below , since for the @xmath7-ology model they have been known for a long time , either from field - theoretical rg scheme @xcite or more recent wk rg formulations @xcite ) .",
    "we address the issues of how to practically employ the wk rg in higher orders , to which technically simpler scheme the wk rg can be reduced and to what extend , by studying the @xmath7-ology model of 1d fermions .",
    "the model we consider is the simplest case of the condensed - matter fermions where the fermi surface manifold is just a set of two points . by going deeper into a recent suggestion to this problem @xcite",
    ", we apply a wk rg transformation assuring that at each step of the procedure all momenta lie within the infinitesimal shell of integration and satisfy the conservation laws , so there are no contributions from the extra states nor double counting .",
    "we show how the higher order renormalizations of the effective action s parameters appear from the summation of the cascades of contractions generated at each step of the wk procedure .",
    "we do nt go beyond the two - loop level , which is apparently the optimal one for feasible calculations . at this level , we show that the summations over the cascades in the wk scheme is equivalent ( in the fixed - point limit of the decreasing cutoff @xmath8 ) to applying the cutoff regularization for the field - theoretic rg _ with the extra states excluded from the phase space_. this result , to the best of our knowledge , was not explicitly shown before .",
    "considerable simplifications for our analysis came from introducing the chiral matrix formalism .",
    "this is a nave ( for the simple 1d case ) first attempt to build into the technique the disentanglement of geometry ( characterized by the `` large '' rigid scale @xmath5 ) and the low - energy sector _ per se _ ( characterized by the decreasing scale @xmath2 ) , and to map the latter to the same origin .",
    "this mapping makes the exclusion of the extra states particularly simple .",

    "the physical case of the spin-@xmath27 electrons is recovered by setting @xmath28 .",
    "we decompose the interaction by factorizing its symmetric and antisymmetric frequency - momentum- and spin- dependent parts as @xmath29 where the functions",
    "@xmath30 are symmetric / antisymmetric under exchange of the left or right pairs of their variables .",
    "two operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which are respectively symmetric and antisymmetric in the spin space , are defined as follows :    [ base ] @xmath33    the one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) four - point vertex @xmath34 , defined in the standard way , comprises two components ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) and can be written in the same manner as ( [ pots ] ) . along with such representation showing explicitly its antisymmetry , there is another one which separates the vertex into charge and spin components via @xmath37 the latter representation is often more convenient since charge and spin components decouple in many practical calculations .",
    "@xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) in eq.([vrep ] ) are hermitian traceless generators of the @xmath9 group , coinciding with the pauli matrices for @xmath28 , and normalized such that @xmath40 they also satisfy the following fierz identity : @xmath41 the components of the vertex in different representations are related as    [ abdef ] @xmath42      the construction of the low - energy effective fermionic action as a simplified form of the generic @xmath11-action ( [ s0],[sint ] ) reduces in 1d essentially to the three key steps : extraction of a finite set of ( marginal ) couplings ; decomposition of the physical electron @xmath43-field into two chiral fields `` near '' left and right fermi points ; linearization of the one - particle spectrum @xmath44 around these points .",
    "there exists an extensive literature on the derivation of the 1d effective action models ( tomonaga - luttinger , @xmath7-ology ) , and on many subtleties it involves ( see , e.g. , ref . [ ] and more references therein ) . so below we simply present notations , approximations and highlight the main points .",
    "the chiral matrix representation we derive here is in fact only a way to re - write the well - known @xmath7-ology model .",
    "( for details see the next subsection . )",

    "the @xmath9 and exchange symmetry constraints leave us with four independent marginal couplings :    [ 4coupl ] @xmath49    note that the umklapp coupling @xmath50 is operative only in the half - filled case when @xmath51 ( we set the lattice constant @xmath52 ) . for the formalism we develop below this case",
    "is considered as the most general one , while the non - commensurate filling can be recovered by setting @xmath53 .",
    "let us now introduce four @xmath59 matrices @xmath60 such that @xmath61 is the unit matrix , and @xmath60 for @xmath62 correspond to the pauli matrices .",
    "such distinct notation helps to avoid confusion , since @xmath60 operates in the chiral , and not in the spin space .",
    "we attribute an extra chiral index to the grassmannian field as @xmath63 , @xmath64 . then",
    "four terms in the last two lines of eq.([lint ] ) can be written as : @xmath65~ \\bar\\psi_{\\alpha}^{\\alpha'}(1)\\bar\\psi_{\\beta}^{\\beta'}(2 ) \\psi_{\\gamma}^{\\gamma'}(3)\\psi_{\\varepsilon}^{\\varepsilon'}(4)\\ ] ] while the first two lines in that equation give @xmath66~ \\bar\\psi_{\\alpha}^{\\alpha'}(1)\\bar\\psi_{\\beta}^{\\beta'}(2 ) \\psi_{\\gamma}^{\\gamma'}(3)\\psi_{\\varepsilon}^{\\varepsilon'}(4)\\ ] ] where @xmath67 thus @xmath68 the one - particle green s function is spin - independent in the model we consider , but it depends on the chiral index : @xmath69 the linearized bare green s function is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 now we can define the 1pi four - point vertex @xmath34 in this formalism",
    ". we will be interested in a particular limiting form of this vertex when its dependence on the external momenta lying at the fermi points ( parametrized by the chiral indices ) is retained only , while ( @xmath72 ) are discarded . in the lowest order @xmath73",

    "as follows from the group - theory arguments , this structure of the vertex is preserved by interaction @xmath74 : the latter results in only the renormalization of couplings , but no new couplings are generated .",

    "note the explicit antisymmetry of the vertex @xmath77 under exchange of the left or right pairs of variables in the representation ( [ gamg ] ) .",
    "we can recover couplings from the vertex by appropriate convolutions , i.e. ,    [ cps ] @xmath78    and other two couplings are obtained from eq.([cps]b ) by obvious substitutions , namely , @xmath79 ; @xmath80 .      here",
    "we want to make a contact between the chiral matrix formalism and more commonly used @xmath7-ology language ( see , e.g. , ref . [ ] ) .",
    "no surprise that this subsection s formal manipulations with the fully ( anti)symmetrized `` chiral '' action amount essentially to reducing it to the non - symmetrized form .",
    "the latter is usually used as a departure point of various @xmath7-ology models .",
    "let us show first how the charge- and spin - operator interaction action , involving forward and backscattering couplings called @xmath81 , @xmath82 respectively in the @xmath7-ology nomenclature , can be recovered from the part @xmath83 ( [ lfb ] ) of the effective quartic interaction ( [ lsum ] ) .",

    "we have also defined the charge and spin couplings :    [ gsc ] @xmath100    it is worth noting that although there is no one - to - one correspondence between 1d couplings ( [ 4coupl]a , b ) and the vertex components @xmath101 [ the latter in 1d are rather products of corresponding couplings and operators in the chiral space , as can be seen from comparison of eqs.([vrep],[gamg ] ) ] , the definitions for the components which couple separated charge or spin modes ( [ abdef ] ) hold for the chiral ones ( [ gsc ] ) .",

    "we apply the original wilson - kadanoff momentum - space renormalization group scheme @xcite to the effective action with the quartic interaction containing four coupling constants .",
    "this interaction in the chiral formalism is given by eqs .",
    "( [ gamg],[compact ] ) . in that formalism",
    "all the constraints coming from the original two - point geometry of the fermi surface , and consequently , occurrence of the two types ( left / right ) of fermion fields and of green s functions , are taken care of by the appropriate summations over chiral indices . in applying the rg procedure we successively integrate out the grassmannian fields in the phase space of the small momenta @xmath48 ( [ 1dk ] ) .",
    "the latter , like in the quantum or classical @xmath107-theories , can be seen now as having common origin towards which we eliminate modes in the @xmath108-space .",
    "we start with the effective action ( [ gamg],[compact ] ) having momenta restricted by the initial ( bare ) ultra - violet ( uv ) cutoff @xmath0 ( [ ksm ] ) .",
    "after @xmath20 steps of the mode elimination ( @xmath109 ) , we end up with the cutoff @xmath2 chosen such that : @xmath110 ( we choose the rg scheme without rescaling of the cutoff . ) each step consists of mode integration within the infinitesimal shell @xmath111 in the @xmath108-space , where @xmath112 ( the equidistant step is chosen for simplicity only ) such that after n steps the uv cutoff @xmath113 is @xmath114 we define the @xmath115-th shell in the momentum space @xmath116 as @xmath117 \\cup [ \\lambda_n , \\lambda_{n-1 } ] \\equiv { \\mathcal s}_n^- \\cup { \\mathcal s}_n^+\\ ] ] in the final results given in the following sections we will smoothly take continuous limit @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) such that relationship ( [ deltad ] ) holds",
    ". then the lowering cutoff @xmath2 will be determined by the continuous rg flow parameter @xmath120 defined as : @xmath121 as it was discussed in the closely related earlier study of the @xmath7-ology model @xcite , the straightforward application of the wilson - kadanoff rg beyond one - loop level encounters some difficulties .",
    "they stem from the constraint on the momenta to be integrated out at the @xmath115-th step to lie within the shell @xmath116 , and on the total momentum flowing through a given graph to conserve .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "[ ] that the solution of this problem consistent with the logic of the wk rg can be found when multi - loop graphs ( the standard ones for the field - theoretical rg ) renormalizing action s vertices are obtained through cascades of contractions at different steps of the rg procedure . in this study",
    "we refine the `` cascade scheme '' of the rg calculations put forward in ref .",
    "[ ] for the @xmath7-ology model .",
    "we show that the aforementioned constraints on the momenta can be cast in terms of the `` selection rules '' for the numbers of steps entering a given cascade of contractions .",
    "summations over all allowed types of cascades provides the results particularly illuminating for understanding the origin of the ( logarithmic ) equivalence of the wk and field - theoretic rg versions .",
    "we use the standard definition for the field renormalization constant relating it to the self - energy ( assuming that the analytical continuation from matsubara frequencies is done ) : @xmath122 it is easy to show that in our model @xmath123 does not dependent on the chirality index .",
    "the first correction to @xmath123 comes from the two - loop `` sunrise '' self - energy diagram .",
    "however , in the wk rg scheme such a diagram if obtained in the second order by a contraction of three legs of the four - leg interaction ( [ seffint ] ) with itself , gives a vanishingly small contribution .",
    "this is due to the momentum constraints discussed above .",

    "the graphs we are looking for can come only from two types of cascades of contractions generated by the mode elimination of the original action ( [ seffint ] ) : 3-step and 2-step cascades depicted in fig .  1 .",

    "we did not take care of the kinematics of diagrams ( that is why we did not indicate the momentum directions in the graphs of fig .  1 ) , and the integers numerating the steps are unrelated and free to take any values restricted only by the total number of steps of the rg procedure , i.e. , @xmath127 . to take zero values .",

    "as one can see , formula ( [ sigs ] ) for the self - energy resembles the one derived in the rg scheme where momenta are let to run freely within a whole band restricted only by the ir and uv cutoffs .    to sharpen the last statement ,",
    "let us derive now the self - energy in the field - theoretic rg scheme with the cutoff regularization .",
    "( thorough description of various field - theoretic rg approaches can be found , e.g. , in ref .",
    "let us assume that we have the same bare effective action as we used before . since the theory is logarithmical , we regularize divergent integrals by introducing ir and uv cutoffs .",
    "we assume that they satisfy the same conditions as those for the wk effective action ( [ cutoffs ] ) .",
    "since _ a priori _ the cutoffs in the field - theoretic and wk approaches are not the same , we will mark the former with tildes . to be the smallest scale of the problem we will work with the theory in the zero - temperature limit . for the following comparisons",
    "note that the second condition ( [ cutoffs ] ) effectively brings the wk rg results to the zero - temperature limit as well . ]",
    "contrary to the wk scheme , in the field - theoretic approach the self - energy contribution we are looking for : _",
    "( i ) _ comes from the _ only one _ sunrise graph as those depicted in fig .  2 ; _ ( ii ) _ independent momenta in the graph",
    "are restricted by the model cutoffs only ; _",
    "( iii ) _ the graph has a combinatorial factor @xmath163 .",
    "all the summations before the final momentum integrations in this graph lead to the same formulas as in the previous subsection ( except the overall factor @xmath163 ) .",
    "we choose a couple of independent momenta @xmath48 restricted by the cutoffs @xmath164 .",
    "it can be shown that the term of the self - energy involving charge and spin couplings can be brought to the form ( [ sigs ] ) with @xmath165 , @xmath166 up to @xmath167 . with the same accuracy",
    "the self - energy umklapp terms coincide in the wk and field - theoretic approaches .",
    "thus both schemes result in the same leading @xmath168 term in the derivative of the self - energy with respect to the frequency , and therefore to the same rg equation ( [ zrg ] ) .",
    "the relationship between the two rg schemes can be seen even in a simpler way in the limit @xmath8 , i.e. , the fixed point limit we are always interested in .",
    "let us draw the regions of momenta integrations corresponding to the solutions from table i summed over available @xmath115 and @xmath124 .",
    "as a couple of independent momenta we choose @xmath169 .",
    "these regions are shown in fig .",
    "let us remind also that while showing kinematically non - equivalent cascades ( a - c ) in fig .  2 we have used the ( anti)symmetry of the vertex , and , correspondingly , that of graph s contributions under the exchange ( @xmath170 ) . so the sum of these three graphs can also be written as @xmath171 , where the primed graphs correspond to the above exchange .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "3 the regions for unprimed and primed solutions ( the primed solutions are obtained from their unprimed counterparts by the reflection over the main diagonal ) , fill completely the hexagon shown in bold .",
    "the latter is nothing but the whole phase space of the sunrise graph @xmath172 now assuming that the summations and integrations commute we can write the total sunrise self - energy correction @xmath173 resulting from the sum of three kinematically distinct graphs 2a - c over two solutions for each graph and over all available cascades as a single term @xmath174 here we came back to the original thin variables comprising chiral and spin indices , matsubara frequencies , and momenta ( @xmath175 ) . thus the self - energy correction has the same analytical form as the one written in the cutoff field - theoretic approach . in the latter however , after removing one momentum by the delta - function ( e.g. , @xmath158 ) only two independent momenta are explicitly restricted by @xmath0 .",
    "this results in the contributions from the extra states forbidden by the whole phase space constraints .",
    "these extra states lie in the triangles in the first and third quadrants of the @xmath169-plane ( cf .",
    "fig .  3 ) . in the logarithmic theory as the one we are dealing with , integration over these forbidden states may result in only the finite terms to the self - energy correction , thus leaving the rg equation ( [ zrg ] ) unaffected . )",
    "that summation over frequencies bringing the fermi functions into play , suppresses completely the differences between two schemes coming from the extra states . for @xmath176 the contributions from the first and third quadrants",
    "are completely eliminated by the fermi functions [ cf .",
    "eq.([fszero]a ) ] . but generically there are no reasons for that , and the umklapp contribution provides a counterexample for @xmath176 .",
    "eqs.([fszero]b , c ) . ]    the phase space mapping of fig .",
    "3 holds in the fixed - point limit @xmath8 at non - zero temperature as well .",
    "thus the temperature effects can be calculated from the uv cutoff rg scheme upon integration of the all phase space restricted by the hexagon in fig .",
    "3 . , are modified at @xmath177 when decreasing cutoff @xmath178 reaches the scale provided by the temperature . ]",
    "as it should be clear , this is not equivalent either to calculation within wk rg stopped at some @xmath179 when @xmath180 , or within the two - cutoffs rg with the ir cutoff provided by @xmath181 : such two ways of calculations give , strictly speaking , approximations only .",
    "after explaining most of technicalities in the previous section , we will be brief in presenting the results for the rg coupling equations .",
    "let us first write the two - loop perturbative expansion for the four - point 1pi vertex .",
    "it is depicted graphically in fig .",
    "( the tadpole self - energy corrections are absorbed in the one - particle green s functions renormalizations . )",
    "we calculate the couplings from @xmath182 at @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the minimal matsubara fermionic frequency .",
    "the latter is set to zero after appropriate analytical continuation .",
    "the couplings are extracted from @xmath185 by convolutions [ cf .",
    "eqs.([cps ] ) and below ] .",
    "the limits ( [ gamlim ] ) considerably reduce the number of cascades to take into account while calculating the renormalized couplings .",
    "one - loop corrections are generated by a simple contraction shown in the first line of fig .",
    "after summations over the shell number these contributions reduce to three one - loop graphs with the signs and factors as in the pertubrative expansion in fig .  4 and the loop momentum @xmath186 .",
    "pertinent double - loop graphs are generated by the 2-step cascade as follows : at the @xmath115-th step a simple one loop is generated ( cf .",
    "first line of fig .",
    "1b ) and at the @xmath124-th step the left ( or right ) pair of legs of this graph is contracted with the four - leg vertex .",
    "the shell numbers @xmath115 and @xmath124 are independent and can take any value from 1 to @xmath20 .",
    "the sums of these cascades result in the three double - loop graphs ( dl ) as they stand in the second line in fig .  4 with the loop momenta restricted by @xmath187 .",
    "the two - loop graphs combined in the groups ( zz , zc , cz ) in fig .",
    "4 are generated by the 3-step cascades .",
    "for concreteness let us take the first graph from the group zz .",
    "for each type of this loop configuration with a fixed position of external variables ( top left in fig .",
    "5 ) there are six graphs corresponding to all possible types of the 3-step contractions shown in this figure .",
    "direct inspection shows that the sign and combinatorial factor of all these six graphs are the same and coincide with those of their counterpart in the perturbative expansion in fig .",
    "4 . due to conditions ( [ gamlim ] )",
    "we retain only such cascades that the legs of the vertex @xmath22 are contracted at the same step . from the conservation law",
    "the momenta @xmath188 are equal ( opposite for the cz graphs ) , so the phase space constraints near the vertex @xmath22 are satisfied trivially . to find the allowed kinematic solutions from the second independent momentum conservation ( e.g. , at the vertex @xmath16 of this graph ) we can use directly the results of the previous section . indeed , if we identify @xmath189 of the graphs in fig .  5 with @xmath190 of fig .  2 ,",
    "respectively , we recover the situation analysed previously for the self - energy graphs .",
    "the kinematic solutions for the graphs of fig .",
    "5 can be taken from table i ( in the limit @xmath191 ) as follows : @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 . then contributions @xmath198 ( cf",
    ". footnote on p.  ) can be combined into a single graph ( top left in fig .",
    "5 ) with two independent momenta lying in the phase space shown in fig .  3 .",
    "analogous conclusions can be reached for other graphs of the groups zz , zc , cz .",
    "thus , provided the stipulated above phase space of each graph , the renormalization of the vertex after mode elimination between @xmath2 and @xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) is given by fig .",
    "the rest of the calculations is straightforward .",
    "we introduce the renormalized ( dimensionless ) couplings as follows : @xmath199 the vertex renormalization constants @xmath200 in terms of @xmath201 are found to be :    [ zsharp ] @xmath202    combining the equations @xmath203 with eqs.([zrg],[zsharp ] ) we obtain the rg flow equations for couplings :    [ grg ] @xmath204    these equations were obtained earlier within the field - theoretic rg analysis @xcite .",
    "note that in the above equations we dropped all the contributions from @xmath105 assuming that they can be absorbed in the renormalization of fermi velocities .",
    "( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "[ ] and more references therein . )",
    "the equivalence of the rg flow equations in the wk and field - theoretic schemes at the two - loop level is proven explicitly for the 1d @xmath7-ology model . to obtain the higher - order rg equations within the canonical wk approach ,",
    "it is crucial to sum over all available cascades of contaractions occurring at the infinitesimal steps of the wk procedure .",
    "moreover , in the fixed - point limit @xmath8 the diagrammatics of the wk rg summed over all cascades is shown to be the same as that of the field - theoretic rg with the cutoff regularization and restricted phase space .",
    "generalizations for the cases of classical or quantum bosonic and fermionic fields and higher dimensions are straightforward within the developed technique , resulting in the same conclusion about the diagrammatics , provided that the relevant phase space of those fields ( i.e. , the low - energy sector ) can be brought to the same origin .",
    "if the latter condition can not be satisfied easily , like , e.g , for the low - energy sector of higher dimensional condensed - matter fermions possessing a fermi surface , the proof of equivalence is not a straightforward extension within the proposed approach , and more explicit work is needed to demonstrate it .",
    "however we conjecture that even in that case the summation over cascades within the wk rg tantamount to applying the field - theoretic rg with a ( bare ) uv cutoff for the low - energy sector and locally - imposed phase - space constraints of the integrated momenta .",
    "( for the examples of how these constraints may be realized , see the review by shankar [ ] . )    at the level of three loops and higher , different rg schemes may result in different flow equations . within the present approach",
    ", it follows from the necessity to take into account the dependence of running couplings on the shell number in higher orders ( cf .",
    "footnote on p.  ) .",
    "so various cascade contributions could not be `` compactified '' in a single `` field - theoretic '' graph as it occurs at the two - loop level .",
    "the latter conclusion is hardly surprising , since the differences in the gell - mann  low functions in higher orders are known to occur even within different versions of the field - theoretic rg .",
    "( see , e.g , ref .",
    "[ ] . in the context of the 1d @xmath7-ology , see also ref . [ ] for the discussion of the bandwidth- and transfer - cutoff regularizations in higher orders of rg . )    in condensed - matter problems , where the bare uv cutoff @xmath0 might be a meaningful scale and other scales ( e.g. , @xmath181 , @xmath5 ) may be present as well , the wk rg scheme should be applied , as the one which is just an exact way to to integrate the partition function @xcite .",
    "the wk rg does not rely on any assumptions of the scales involved , scaling / logarithmicity of theory , etc , and includes contributions only from the states lying within the phase space of the problem .",
    "this allows to control the results ( at least in principle ) in all orders . in practical terms , after summations over all cascades the wk scheme asymptotically maps to the much easier to handle field - theoretic rg ( up to three loops ) with forbidden states excluded .",
    "we did not verify whether possible simplifications of the wk scheme can be done in even higher orders , but going beyond two - loop level is a formidable problem in any case .",
