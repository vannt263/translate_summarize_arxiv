    "many natural and artificial systems consist of a population of agents with coupled dynamics . through their mutual adaptation",
    ", they are able to exhibit interesting collective behavior .",
    "although the individuals are competing to maximize their own payoffs , the system is able to self - organize itself to globally efficient states .",
    "examples can be found in economic markets and communication networks @xcite .",
    "an important factor affecting the behavior of an adaptive population is the dependence of the payoffs on the environment experienced by the individual agents .",
    "the payoffs facilitate the agents to assess the preferences of their decisions , hence inducing them to take certain actions when they experience similar dynamical environment in the future .",
    "thus , the payoff function is crucial to the mechanism of adaptation .    as a prototype of an adaptive population , the minority game ( mg ) considers the dynamics of the buyers and sellers in a model of the financial market , in which the minority group is the winning one @xcite .",
    "a good indicator of the mutual adaptation of the agents is the reduction of the variance of the buyer population to values below those of random fluctuations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this variance has a universal dependence on the complexity of the strategies adopted by the agents , dropping to a minimum when the complexity is reduced to a universal critical value , and rapidly rising thereafter @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies using the replica method @xcite and the generating functional @xcite confirmed these general trends .",
    "the agents in the original version of mg uses a _",
    "payoff function @xcite , meaning that the payoffs received by the winning group are the same , irrespective of the _ winning margin _ ( the difference between the majority and minority group ) .",
    "latter versions of mg uses a _ linear _",
    "payoff function @xcite , in which the payoffs increase with the winning margin .",
    "other payoff functions yield the same macroscopic behavior in their dependence of the population variance on the complexity of strategies @xcite .",
    "thus , the behavior of the population is universal as long as the payoff function favors the minority group",
    ". a recent extension of the mg considers payoff functions which reward the minority agents only when they win by a large margin , but punish them when the winning margin is small @xcite .",
    "the extended model displays a smooth crossover from a minority game to a majority game when the payoff function is tuned .",
    "however , when one considers details beyond the population variance , one can find that the agents self - organize in different ways induced by different payoff functions .",
    "for a payoff function that favors a large winning margin , the distribution of the buyer population is doubled - peaked @xcite .",
    "this shows that the dynamics of the population self - organizes to favor large winning margins of either the buyers or sellers , since the agents have adapted themselves to maximize their payoffs .    in this paper",
    ", we compare the behavior of mgs using step and linear payoffs .",
    "previously , we found that the population variance scales as a power law of the _ diversity _ for a step payoff @xcite .",
    "diversity refers to the variance of the initial biases of the strategy payoffs of the agents . in a population with diverse preferences of strategies ,",
    "the adaptation rate is slow , resulting in small fluctuations of the buyer or seller population .",
    "as we shall see , when the payoff function becomes linear , the scaling relation between the variance and the diversity for the step payoff is replaced by a continuous dynamical transition from a vanishing variance at high diversity to a finite variance at low diversity .",
    "the dynamical transition is due to the payoffs being enhanced by large winning margins at low diversity .",
    "furthermore , for systems with multi - dimensional signals feeding the strategies , the dynamical transition in each dimension do not take place at the same transition point .",
    "rather , there is a cascade of dynamical transitions for the different signal dimensions .",
    "this rich behavior demonstrates the flexibility of an adaptive population for self - organizing to states in which agents maximize their payoffs , and is hence important in the modeling of economics and distributed control .",
    "the minority game model consists a population of _",
    "n _ agents competing for limited resources , _",
    "n _ being odd @xcite .",
    "each agent makes a decision 1 or 0 at each time step , and the minority group wins . for economic markets , the decisions 1 and 0",
    "correspond to buying and selling respectively , so that the buyers can win by belonging to the minority group , which pushes the price down , and vice versa . for typical control tasks such as the distribution of shared resources",
    ", the decisions 1 and 0 may represent two alternative resources , so that less agents utilizing a resource implies more abundance .",
    "the decisions of each agent are responses to the environment of the game , described by _ signal _ @xmath0 at time _ t _ , where @xmath1 .",
    "these responses are prescribed by _ strategies _ , which are binary functions mapping the _ d _ signals to decisions 1 or 0 . in this paper",
    ", we consider _ endogenous _ signals , which are the _ history _ of the winning bits in the most recent _ m _ steps .",
    "thus , the strategies have an input dimension of @xmath2 , and the parameter @xmath3 is referred to as the _",
    "complexity_. before the game starts , each agent randomly picks _ s _ strategies . out of her _ s _ strategies , each agent makes decisions according to the most successful one at each step .",
    "the success of a strategy is measured by its cumulative payoff , as explained below .",
    "let @xmath4 when the decisions of strategy _ a _ are 1 or 0 respectively , responding to signal _",
    "@xmath5_. let @xmath6 be the strategy adopted by agent _",
    "i _ at time _",
    "t_. then @xmath7 is the excess demand of the game at time _",
    "t_. the payoff received by strategy @xmath8 is then @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the payoff function . for step and linear payoffs , @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "( here , we have implicitly assumed that an agent does not consider the impact of adopting a strategy , although the excess demand is only dependent on the adopted ones . )",
    "let @xmath13 be the cumulative payoff of strategy _ a _ at time _",
    "t_. then its updating dynamics is described by @xmath14 diversity of initial preferences of strategies is introduced by adding random biases @xmath15 to the cumulative payoffs of strategy _ a _ ( _ _ a__@xmath16 ) of agent _ i _ with respect to her first one .",
    "the biases are drawn from a gaussian or binomial distribution with mean 0 and variance _ r_. the ratio @xmath17 is referred to as the _",
    "diversity_.    to monitor the mutual adaptive behavior of the population , we measure the variance @xmath18 of the population making decision 1 , defined by @xmath19^{2}\\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the average is taken over time when the system reaches the steady state , and over the random distribution of strategies and biases .",
    "as shown in fig .  1 , the dependence of the variance @xmath18 on the complexity @xmath20 for linear payoffs is very similar to that for step payoffs @xcite . for @xmath20 above a universal critical value @xmath21 , the variance drops when",
    "@xmath20 is reduced .",
    "the effects of introducing the diversity is also similar to that for step payoffs , namely , the variance remains unaffected when @xmath22 , but decreases significantly with the diversity when @xmath23 .",
    "however , there are differences when one goes beyond this general trend . as shown in fig .  2",
    ", the variance curves at different values of @xmath20 cross at at @xmath24 , indicating the existence of a continuous phase transition at @xmath25 from a phase of vanishing variance at large @xmath26 to a phase of finite variance at small @xmath26 .",
    "this behavior is very different from that for step payoffs , where the variance scales as @xmath27 and there are no dynamical transitions ( fig .  2 inset ) .",
    "the picture is confirmed by analyzing the dynamics of the game for small @xmath28 .",
    "the dynamics can be conveniently described by introducing the @xmath29-dimensional vector @xmath30 .",
    "while only one of the @xmath29 signals corresponds to the historical signal @xmath0 of the game , the augmentation to @xmath29 components is necessary to describe the attractor structure of the game dynamics .",
    "3 illustrates the attractor structure in this phase space for the visualizable case of @xmath31 .",
    "the dynamics proceeds in the direction which tends to reduce the magnitude of the components of @xmath32 @xcite . however , the components of @xmath32 overshoot , resulting in periodic attractors of period @xmath33 . for @xmath31 ,",
    "the attractor is described by the sequence @xmath34 , and takes the l - shape as shown in fig .",
    "note that the displacements in the two directions may not have the same amplitude .",
    "following steps similar to those in @xcite , we find that for @xmath28 not too large , and for convergence within time steps much less than @xmath35 , @xmath36 for step payoffs , eq .",
    "( [ step ] ) converges to an attractor confined in a @xmath29-dimensional hypercube of size @xmath37 , irrespective of the value of @xmath38 . on the other hand , for linear payoffs",
    ", @xmath39 becomes a linear function of @xmath32 with a slope of @xmath40 .",
    "hence , for @xmath41 , the step sizes @xmath42a@xmath43 converge to zero , whereas for @xmath44 , steps of vanishing sizes become unstable , resulting in a continuous dynamical transition at @xmath45 .",
    "however , when @xmath44 , the step sizes for each of the @xmath29 signals may not be equal .",
    "to see this , we monitor the variance for each of the @xmath29 signals and rank them .",
    "the _ _ r__th maximum variance is then given by @xmath46,r\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the _",
    "_ r__th largest function @xmath48 for @xmath49 .    as shown in figs .  4 - 5",
    ", the step sizes for each of the @xmath29 signals do not bifurcate simultaneously at @xmath50 , rather , only their first maximum bifurcates from zero when @xmath26 falls below @xmath45 , while the step sizes for the remaining @xmath29 - 1 signals remain small .",
    "when the diversity further decreases to around 0.05 , the second maximum becomes unstable as well , and a further bifurcation takes place . for @xmath51 , there are further bifurcations of the third or higher order maxima , resulting in a _ cascade _ of dynamical transitions when the diversity decreases .",
    "this cascade of transitions is confirmed by analysis . for @xmath31",
    ", we can generalize eq .",
    "( [ step ] ) to convergence times of the order @xmath35 . assuming without loss of generality that @xmath52 bifurcates",
    "while @xmath53 remains small , the variance of the buyer population , as derived in @xcite , is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the step size responding to signal 1 . as fig .",
    "4 inset shows , the analytical and simulation results well agree down to @xmath56 .",
    "however , when the diversity decreases further , this simple analysis implies that the variance will saturate to a constant @xmath57 , whereas simulation results are clearly higher .",
    "this discrepancy is due to a further bifurcation of the minimum step size .",
    "this can be analyzed by considering the effect of a perturbation @xmath58 in the direction of @xmath53 .",
    "after a period of 4 steps , the accumulated perturbation becomes @xmath59^{2}\\delta\\mathrm{a}^{0}(t)\\label{stability}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at @xmath60 , where @xmath61a@xmath62 , the coefficient on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ stability ] ) reaches the value 1 , and @xmath58 diverges on further reduction of @xmath26 .",
    "numerical iterations of the analytical equations for @xmath63 , averaged over samples of different initial conditions , yield the theoretical curves in fig .  4 and inset , agreeing very well with simulation results .",
    "similarly , the agreement between analytical and simulation results are satisfactory for @xmath64 .",
    "since the attractors have asymmetric responses to different signals , we also study their dependence on the initial states . letting the system start from a certain state ( say , state 1 for @xmath31 ) for a given sample , fig .",
    "6 shows that the initial state is more likely to have the largest step size in the attractor for @xmath31 .",
    "simulations show that higher values of @xmath28 share the same trend .",
    "we have studied the behavior of an adaptive population using a payoff function that increases linearly with the winning margin .",
    "we found a continuous dynamical transition when the adaptation rate of the population is tuned by varying their diversity of preferences .",
    "this is in contrast with the case of payoff functions independent of the winning margin , in which no phase transitions are found .",
    "furthermore , we found a cascade of dynamical transitions in the responses to different signals .",
    "this shows that an adaptive population has the ability to self - organize to globally efficient states and display a rich behavior , although the individual agents make selfish decisions .",
    "hence , despite the simplicity of the population models , they are able to capture the essential features of economic markets and distributed control .",
