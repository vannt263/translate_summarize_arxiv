    "recently , a new member of fullerenes , c@xmath0 , was synthesized by arc - discharge method and purified in bulk quantities@xcite . up to now , it is the smallest fullerene ever discovered .",
    "the c@xmath0 molecule is more curved than c@xmath2 because of the adjacent pentagonal rings and the small number of carbon atoms@xcite .",
    "this feature suggests stronger electron - phonon interaction and possible higher superconducting transition temperatures in the alkali - doped c@xmath0 solids than those of c@xmath2@xcite .",
    "the solid - state nuclear magnetic resonant experiment suggested that the most favorable configuration of c@xmath0 molecule has @xmath1 symmetry @xcite . this confirmed the results of the early _ ab initio _ pseudopotential density functional calculations@xcite , which indicated that the @xmath1 structure is one of the most energetically favorable structures among several possibilities",
    ".    looked in a direction perpendicular to the six - fold axis(fig.1 ) , the molecule is composed of six parallel layers . on each layer , six carbon atoms lie at the vertexes of a hexagon .",
    "the edges of the hexagons of the 1st , 2nd , 5th , 6th layers are parallel , while those of the two hexagons in the middle two layers are turned by an angle of @xmath3 .",
    "in addition to this special structure , the six - fold principal axis is distinct form the ordinary five - fold principal axis in the cases of c@xmath2 and c@xmath4 and little attention has been paid to it . in this paper , we discuss both the electronic and structural properties of c@xmath0 molecule , emphasizing the interesting properties brought by this unusual @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "we employ a simple and elegant model , extended ssh model , which is successful in treating c@xmath2 and c@xmath4@xcite .",
    "the bdeg formalism is performed to obtain the stable lattice configuration and the corresponding electronic states self - consistently .",
    "the electronic part of hamiltonian without coulomb interaction can be solved analytically by methods of group theory .",
    "we find that the electron densities of homo(@xmath5 ) and lumo(@xmath6 ) are zero at the two middle layers .",
    "furthermore , the homo and lumo are mainly confined in the 2nd and 5th layers with a possibility of @xmath7 .",
    "the gap between them is considerably small , compared to that of c@xmath2 and c@xmath4 , because the splitting of homo and lumo is due to a long - distance hopping in our case .",
    "we find the large splitting of the triplet and singlet excitons due to more localized homo an lumo in comparison with c@xmath2 and c@xmath4 . as a result",
    ", the triplet exciton s energy is very small and possible experiments are suggested to test this phenomenum .",
    "the geometrical figures of c@xmath0 molecule and polarons are discussed and bond lengths and angles are calculated . the charge density on each layer",
    "are given .",
    "we find that the differences of charge densities among polarons and molecule are mainly in the 2nd and 5th layers .",
    "the following sections are arranged as : in sec.@xmath8 , the extended ssh model is introduced ; in sec.@xmath9 , we analytically solve the electronic part of the hamiltonian without coulomb interaction ; in sec.@xmath10 , the whole hamiltonian is solved self - consistently ; in sec.@xmath11 , results and discussions are presented ; and conclusions are made in the final section .",
    "the hamiltonian of the extended ssh model to the c@xmath0 molecule is written as : @xmath12 the first term @xmath13 of eq.(1 ) is the hopping term of @xmath14-electrons .",
    "@xmath15(c_{i\\sigma}^\\dagger c_{j\\sigma}+h.c . ) -{\\sum_{\\langle i , j \\rangle}}^\\prime t_1(c_{i\\sigma}^\\dagger c_{j\\sigma}+h.c . )",
    "\\nonumber\\\\ & -&{\\sum_{\\langle i , j \\rangle}}^{\\prime\\prime } t_2(c_{i\\sigma}^\\dagger   c_{j\\sigma}+h.c.)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the three terms describe hopping between the nearest neighbors , the next nearest neighbors and the third neighbors respectively , with the corresponding hopping integrals @xmath16 and @xmath17 . the influence of electron - phonon coupling is only included in the first term of @xmath13 , since those of the last two terms are much smaller than @xmath18 .",
    "the third term is important here because it changes the accidental degeneracy of homo and lumo states , which will be explained in the next section .",
    "the larger distance terms are neglected , as they are small and do not bring any new effects .",
    "the second term of eq.(1 ) is the screened coulomb interaction expressed in the hubbard model .",
    "@xmath19 where @xmath20 is the strength of the on - site interaction , and @xmath21 is that between the nearest neighbors .",
    "the third term of eq.(1 ) is the elastic energy of the lattice .",
    "this term is composed of three parts , @xmath22 where the first part describes the spring energy of bond - length terms , and the next two terms describe the spring energy of the angular terms .",
    "@xmath23 are the elastic constants for these different kinds of lattice vibrations .",
    "@xmath24 are bond angle deviations from the original angle @xmath25 .",
    "e.g. @xmath26 .",
    "the first summation is taken up over all nearest pairs .",
    "the second is of all interior angles of pentagons .",
    "and the third is of all interior angles of hexagons .    since there are no enough experiment data to determine the semiempirical parameters , we set the values in the scope of fullerenes such as c@xmath2 and c@xmath4 which can produce reasonable results . we adjust them to give the gap between homo and lumo and the bond length consistent with those of the pseudopotential density functional approach .",
    "we take @xmath27 ev , @xmath28 ev /  , @xmath29  , @xmath30 ev/ @xmath31 , @xmath32 ev / rad@xmath31 , @xmath33 ev / rad@xmath31 , @xmath34 .",
    "in fact , the particular values , except for the value of @xmath17 , would not affect the physics too much . based on the calculation of the third - nearest @xmath14-orbit integral ,",
    "@xmath17 was estimated to be 0.111@xmath18 .",
    ".the analytical solution of @xmath13 without @xmath35 and @xmath17 terms . [ cols=\">,>,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the configurations and energy of ground and low excited states are given below ,    @xmath36    we can see that the ground state @xmath37 is a spin singlet rather than triplet after the long distance hopping @xmath17 and electron - electron interaction are taken into account , which is an improvement of the prediction of simple hckel theory , and there is no need to add the hybridizing of @xmath38 and @xmath14 bonds to investigate the qualitative physics of c@xmath0 as discussed in ref.@xcite .    the lowest excited states @xmath39 are spin triplet excitons , which are only about @xmath40ev above the ground states .",
    "the energy of singlet exciton @xmath41 is very high , and the splitting between the triplet and singlet excitons is about 0.63ev , which is much larger than 0.2ev in the cases of c@xmath2 and c@xmath4 .",
    "this is because the electrons of homo and lumo are more localized , @xmath7 in the 2nd and 5th layers and @xmath42 in the 1st and 6th layers .",
    "compared to the c@xmath0 case , the electron densities of homo and lumo in c@xmath2 and c@xmath4 are distributed more uniformly over all sites , so the splitting of the singlet and triplet exciton due to the coulomb interaction is relatively small . the fact that the triplet exciton has low energy can be verified through experiment observation : when illuminated by external light , the c@xmath0 can be excited to the state of singlet exciton and then may transit to triplet exciton through nonradiative decay .",
    "the transition rate to ground state is slow because of the different spin configuration and small energy splitting .",
    "we predict that the triplet excitons are metastable states , and the phosphorescence phenomena is possible to be observed .",
    "the triplet exciton is paramagnetic while the ground state is a diamagnetic singlet .",
    "so the magnetic susceptibility is increased upon illumination of the external light .",
    "electron spin resonance(esr ) experiment can be performed to detect the triplet exciton states . when esr is performed to a solution sample ,",
    "the usual unimportant magnetic dipole interaction between electrons becomes crucial because its anisotropy can smear the resonance peak .",
    "however , this interaction is decayed rapidly with distance as @xmath43 .",
    "the electrons in homo and lumo are mainly uniformly distributed on 12 carbon atoms in two layers , the possibility of their short distance is considerably small compared to other small organic molecule , such as naphthalene .",
    "so the resonance peak is possible to be observed .",
    "the phone absorption and luminescence spectra experiments can be perform to test the lowest singlet exciton s energy .",
    "the shape of the c@xmath0 molecule is an ellipsoid with high aspect ratios .",
    "our calculation shows that the distance between the 1st and 6th layers is @xmath44 , and that between the parallel vertical hexagon planes is @xmath45 . the charge density , bond lengths and bond angles of c@xmath0 molecule and ions are calculated and shown in table 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "we note that because of the @xmath1 symmetry of the molecule , the 1st and 6th layers are regular hexagons , with each internal angle @xmath46 and the shortest bonds ( @xmath47 ) @xmath48 .",
    "the six vertical hexagons around the equator are slightly deformed due to the drag of the 1st and 6th layers from each side .",
    "@xmath49 is @xmath50 longer than @xmath47 and @xmath51 than @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath53 bonds are relatively weaker than those in hexagons , because they couple the hexagons in the two ends with the hexagons around the equator .",
    "@xmath53 is @xmath54 longer than @xmath47 .",
    "this result is consistent with that of lda except that the @xmath49 is as long as @xmath52 in lda , and we think that our result is more reasonable .",
    "the bond lengths of @xmath52 and @xmath49 of ions differ from those of molecule very slightly .",
    "but the negative polarons @xmath47 is longer and positive polaron is shorter than the neutral molecule s , while the @xmath53 changes in the opposite way .",
    "the reason is that the wavefunctions of the electron in @xmath5 and @xmath6 has opposite sign between two nearest sites connected by @xmath47 , same sign by @xmath53 , and have zero amplitude on the 3rd , 4th layers . according to the contribution f these two states form hopping term , the sites connected by @xmath47 are repulsive , but those connected by @xmath53 are attractive .",
    "the angles in the pentagons and hexagons around the equator deviate from @xmath55 and @xmath46 slightly , which justifies the validity of @xmath56 .",
    "the bond angles in polarons differ from those of molecule very slightly , so we omit them in table 4 .",
    "form c@xmath57 polaron to c@xmath58 , the adding electrons distribute mostly in the 2nd and 5th layers .",
    "this is because of the particular charge density distribution of the 18th and 19 t levels .",
    "in this paper , we have carefully studied the effect of @xmath1 symmetry on c@xmath0 s electronic properties under the extended ssh model .",
    "a small gap between homo(@xmath59 ) and lumo(@xmath60 ) is obtained due to long distance hopping .",
    "the large splitting of the spin triplet and singlet lowest excitons , the differences of bond lengthes and electron density between molecule and polarons are discussed as results brought by the more localized homo and lumo and their special symmetries .",
    "possilbe experiments are suggested ."
