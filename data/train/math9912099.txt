    "the hypersurface @xmath2 in the complex manifold @xmath3 is a _ free divisor _ if the @xmath4-module @xmath5 of germs of vector fields on @xmath3 which are tangent to @xmath2 , is locally free ( see @xcite ) .",
    "examples of free divisors include smooth hypersurfaces , normal crossing divisors , reflection arrangements ( @xcite ) and discriminants of right - left stable maps with source dimension not less than target dimension ( @xcite , 6.13 ) .    in many contexts ,",
    "one is give a divisor @xmath6 which is free outside @xmath7 , and a family @xmath8 with special fibre @xmath6 , in which the general fibre is free .",
    "typically , @xmath9 grows homology classes which vanish when @xmath10 returns to @xmath7 .",
    "a familiar example of this phenomenon is shown in the following pair of diagrams . in the first , we see four planes passing through @xmath7 in 3-space , of which each three are in general position .",
    "their union , @xmath6 , is a normal crossing divisor , and therefore free , outside @xmath7 .",
    "it is not free at @xmath7 ; this can be checked by a calculation , but it also follows from 2.2 below . in the second picture ,",
    "one of the planes has been shifted off @xmath7 , and the union , @xmath9 , now has a non - trivial second homology class , carried by the tetrahedron one can see in the centre of the picture ( in fact the inclusion of the real @xmath6 and @xmath9 in their complexification , induces a homotopy - equivalence , so these are `` good real pictures '' ) .",
    "since @xmath9 is now a normal crossing divisor ( everywhere ) , it is free .",
    "one can think of @xmath9 as a kind of singular milnor fibre of @xmath6  we have not smoothed @xmath6 ( as in `` classical '' singularity theory ) ; instead we have freed it .",
    "another large class of examples : if @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 ) is a germ of analytic map stable outside @xmath7 ( equivalently , having `` finite @xmath13-codimension '' ) then the discriminant @xmath14 is free outside @xmath7 ; if @xmath15 is a stable perturbation of @xmath16 then @xmath17 is a free divisor , which carries homology classes which vanish when @xmath10 returns to @xmath7 .    in @xcite damon",
    "introduced a definition of _ almost free divisor _ , and a suitable category of deformations , which encompass these examples and many others .",
    "using morse - theoretic techniques introduced in @xcite , he is able to calculate the rank of the vanishing homology . in this paper",
    "we describe the vanishing cohomology in the singular milnor fibres of almost free divisors in terms of differential forms .    for a reasonable description ,",
    "the usual khler forms @xmath18 ( the definition is recalled at the start of section [ def ] ) are not suitable : there are too many of them .",
    "it is well known that if @xmath19 is a singular point of a divisor @xmath2 then @xmath20 has torsion for @xmath21 .",
    "the torsion gives important geometrical information : indeed , if the @xmath22-dimensional divisor @xmath2 has an _ isolated _ singularity at @xmath19 then the torsion submodule of @xmath23 has length equal to the tjurina number , and thus less than or equal to the milnor number , the rank of the vanishing homology ( and equal to it if @xmath2 has a weighted homogeneous defining equation ) . in this case",
    "one can think of torsion @xmath22-forms as forms which are idle ( evaluate to 0 on every n - vector ) on @xmath24 , but which come to life on the milnor fibre of @xmath24 .",
    "the torsion submodule of @xmath23 thus encodes information on the vanishing geometry of the milnor fibre . on a singular free divisor or almost free divisor",
    "@xmath2 the singular subspace has codimension 1 , and thus if @xmath25 , all the modules of khler forms ( except for @xmath26 ) will have torsion submodules of infinite length . in the deformations described by damon , almost free divisors",
    "become free , but are not smoothed , and thus infinite dimensional spaces of khler @xmath27-forms will wait in vain for their vanishing @xmath27-vectors .    the obvious thing to do to remedy",
    "this is to kill the torsion forms on a free divisor @xmath2 ( as free divisors are the stable objects in damon s theory ) .",
    "doing so , we obtain modules which we denote @xmath28 .",
    "the definition of the modules @xmath29 of forms on an almost free divisor @xmath6 then follows by a standard universal procedure  embed @xmath6 in a suitable free divisor @xmath2 , as the fibre of an ambient submersion to a smooth space @xmath30 , and then take the quotient of the module of relative forms @xmath31 defined in the standard way from @xmath28 .",
    "in fact damon defines an almost free divisor @xmath32 as the pull back of a free divisor @xmath33 by a map @xmath34 which is transverse to @xmath35 outside @xmath7 . in the spirit of damon s definition",
    ", we can also define our complex @xmath36 as the quotient of @xmath37 by the ideal generated by the pull - back via @xmath38 of a certain ideal of @xmath39 .",
    "this is discussed in section [ def ] .",
    "this programme , which of course can be applied to any category of spaces with a distinguished category of deformations , turns out to work extremely well for free and almost - free divisors .",
    "in fact if @xmath2 is a free divisor then @xmath40 where @xmath41 is an equation for @xmath2 in @xmath3 , and so , since all the modules @xmath42 are free , the @xmath28 are maximal cohen - macaulay @xmath43-modules . in section [ algebraic properties ]",
    "we show that as a consequence , the @xmath31 enjoy precisely the same depth properties as the modules @xmath44 on deformations of isolated complete intersection singularities ( icis ) .",
    "in particular we prove an analogue of the fact , recalled above , that for an isolated hypersurface singularity the torsion has length @xmath45 :    [ tor ] let @xmath11 , with @xmath12 nice dimensions , have finite @xmath46-codimension , and let @xmath14 be its discriminant .",
    "then the torsion submodule of @xmath47 has length equal to the @xmath46 codimension of @xmath16 .",
    "this is a consquence of [ torsion](4 ) below .",
    "+ in sections  [ using ] ,  [ gm ] and  [ calc ] below , we develop the theory of the gauss - manin connection on the vanishing cohomology of a deformation of an almost free divisor .",
    "the similarity with the classical theory  the gauss - manin connection on cohomology of the milnor fibration of an isolated hypersurface singularity  is evident ; many of the same theorems hold , including coherence , and with almost the same proofs . the author does not claim much originality in this latter part of the paper .",
    "however , what is remarkable is that the old constructions work so well in this new context .",
    "+ this paper has taken a rather long time to write , in the course of which the author , and hopefully the paper , have profited from many helpful conversations with francisco castro and luis narvez , to whom i am very grateful . both the idea of studying the gauss - manin connection on the discriminant of a family , and the definition of @xmath28 , arose in conversation with them .",
    "i am also grateful to jim damon and duco van straten for stimulating conversations on this topic , and to mara aparecida ruas , farid tari and washington luiz marar for an invitation to lecture on this topic in the 1998 so carlos singularities workshop , which led to what i believe are some useful improvements in the presentation of this paper .",
    "i thank the referee for a very careful reading of the manuscript , and for a number of helpful suggestions .",
    "before the deadlines passed me by , i optimistically intended the paper for the proceedings of the 1996 oberwolfach conference in honour of e.brieskorn on his 60th birthday ; notwithstanding the time that has since passed , the paper remains respectfully dedicated to him : imitation is the sincerest form of flattery",
