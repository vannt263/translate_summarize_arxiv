    "let us begin by specifying the construction of stabilizer codes based on triorthogonal matrices .",

    "an @xmath26 triorthogonal matrix @xmath22 can be used to construct an @xmath27-qubit ,  triorthogonal , \" stabilizer code as follows  @xcite . for each even - weight row of @xmath22 , add a stabilizer by mapping non - zero entries to @xmath6 operators , e.g. , @xmath28 . add a stabilizer for each row of the orthogonal complement @xmath29 by similarly mapping non - zero entries to @xmath0 operators .",
    "the logical @xmath6 and @xmath0 operators are then given by mapping non - zero entries of the odd - weight rows of @xmath22 to @xmath6 and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "for example , fixing the six gauge qubits of the @xmath9-qubit hamming code to @xmath14 gives a @xmath30 $ ] triorthogonal code  @xcite .",

    "shown in , the toffoli gate is equivalent to a @xmath7 in which the target qubit is conjugated by hadamard gates .",
    "the toffoli gate is equivalent to a @xmath7 gate in which the target qubit is conjugated by hadamard gates . , title=\"fig:\",height=56 ]   the toffoli gate is equivalent to a @xmath7 gate in which the target qubit is conjugated by hadamard gates . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",height=56 ]    the main component of the construction is an implementation of an encoded @xmath7 gate .",
    "we claim that for any triorthogonal code , transversal application of @xmath7 gates realizes @xmath7 gates on the encoded qubits . for simplicity consider the case of a triorthogonal code with a single encoded qubit , i.e. , based on a triorthogonal matrix @xmath22 with a single odd - weight row , @xmath33 .",
    "( the argument with multiple encoded qubits is fully analogous . )",
    "let @xmath34 be the linear span of all the even - weight rows of @xmath22 and let @xmath35 be the coset @xmath36",
    ". then the encoding of @xmath37 , for @xmath38 , is given by the uniform superposition over @xmath39 : @xmath40 .",
    "the action of transversal @xmath7 on an encoded basis state @xmath41 , for @xmath42 , is therefore given by @xmath43 here @xmath44 can be expanded as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 .",
    "expanding further gives one term @xmath47 , plus other triple product terms in which @xmath48 appears at most twice .",
    "since @xmath22 is triorthogonal , these other terms necessarily have even weight .",
    "the term @xmath49 has odd weight if and only if @xmath50 . substituting back into  , as desired , @xmath51    to complete the toffoli construction",
    ", we also require a fault - tolerant implementation of the hadamard  @xmath5 .",
    "for @xmath5 to be transversal , the code must be self - dual , i.e. , @xmath52 .",
    "unfortunately , no triorthogonal code is self - dual . indeed ,",
    "otherwise , since @xmath7 is transversal it would be possible obtain a transversal implementation of toffoli and @xmath5 for the same code . however , toffoli and @xmath5 together are universal  @xcite , and it is known that universality can not be achieved by transversal gates alone  @xcite ( see also  @xcite )",
    ".    nonetheless , compact and fault - tolerant implementations of logical @xmath5 are still possible .",
    "when transversal @xmath5 is performed on a triorthogonal code , the logical operators are transformed properly : logical @xmath6 maps to logical @xmath0 and vice versa .",
    "a subset of the stabilizers is preserved : observe that @xmath53 , and thus each element of @xmath54 corresponds to both @xmath6 and @xmath0 stabilizers , which transversal @xmath5 swaps .",
    "transversal @xmath5 does not preserve the @xmath0 stabilizers corresponding to @xmath55 , so these must be restored by measuring and correcting them . in the @xmath8 $ ] example above , this involved measuring the six gauge qubits logical @xmath0 operators .",
    "the @xmath0 stabilizers of @xmath55 can be restored during an @xmath6 error - correction procedure .",
    "steane s procedure , for example , involves a transversal cnot from the data to an encoded @xmath56  ancilla \" state  @xcite .",
    "the transversal cnot implements encoded cnot and has the effect of copying the unwanted @xmath6 stabilizers onto the ancilla , and copying the desired @xmath0 stabilizers from the ancilla to the data .",
    "transversal @xmath0-basis measurements of the ancilla then permit correcting @xmath6 errors on the data , while simultaneously restoring the stabilizer group .",
    "( once again , in the @xmath8 $ ] example , the ancilla s gauge qubits are prepared in @xmath14 .",
    "each is measured as @xmath57 or @xmath58 , with a correction required in the latter case . )",
    "alternatively , shor s error - correction procedure uses a separate ghz state @xmath59 for each stabilizer to be measured  @xcite . in either case , the required stabilizers can be measured and corrected using @xmath5 , @xmath6 , cnot , @xmath60 preparation and @xmath0-basis measurements . by using @xmath7 gates to simulate cnot and @xmath6",
    ", the entire toffoli requires only @xmath5 and @xmath7 gates .",
    "importantly , even with additional @xmath6 corrections to fix the @xmath0 stabilizers of @xmath55 , the @xmath6 error - correction procedure is fault tolerant .",
    "that is , @xmath61 gate failures can lead to a data error of weight at most  @xmath61 , for @xmath61 less than half the code s distance  @xmath62 .",
    "indeed , @xmath62 is the minimum of the code s distance @xmath63 against @xmath0 errors ( determined by the @xmath6 stabilizers of @xmath54 ) and its distance @xmath64 against @xmath6 errors ( determined by the @xmath0 stabilizers of @xmath29 ) ; and since @xmath53 , @xmath65 .",
    "thus any @xmath6 error of weight less than @xmath66 can be corrected using only the @xmath0 stabilizers of @xmath54 , and the @xmath0 stabilizers of @xmath55 can be corrected separately .",

    "the simplest way to use the toffoli construction above is with a concatenated triorthogonal code .",
    "a universal set of fault - tolerant operations can be constructed from only @xmath7 and @xmath5 gates .",
    "thus using triorthogonal codes for computation could be useful for circuits that contain large numbers of toffoli gates .",
    "one could also imagine using multiple codes for computation by , for example , teleporting into the code best suited for each logical operation . in this",
    "setting , a triorthogonal code could be used to implement efficiently the @xmath7 operation .",
    "our construction allows for quantum computation to arbitrary accuracy , so long as the error rate per physical gate is below a constant `` threshold '' value  @xcite .",
    "threshold error rates for triorthogonal codes are largely unknown , though estimates for the @xmath30 $ ] code are roughly @xmath68 percent per gate  @xcite . if the @xmath7 operation is constructed from a sequence of one- and two - qubit gates , then the threshold is likely lower .",
    "since resource overhead increases rapidly as the physical noise rate approaches threshold , our construction is likely to be outperformed by schemes based on other codes , for which the threshold can be nearly one percent or higher  ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of high - performing triorthogonal codes is not out of the question , however .",
    "a more conventional way to achieve universality is through state injection and distillation .",
    "bravyi and haah have proposed distillation procedures using triorthogonal codes that permit fault - tolerant implementation of the @xmath16 gate  @xcite .",
    "our result implies that a similar procedure could be used to implement toffoli gates .",

    "three separate blocks are encoded into the state @xmath74 and then transversal @xmath7 gates are applied .",
    "conditioned on detecting no errors , each block is decoded and hadamard gates are applied to each of the target qubits , yielding @xmath61 toffoli states . ]    the distillation procedure given by   can reduce the cost of implementing a toffoli gate .",
    "suppose we wish to implement a toffoli gate with error below @xmath75 .",
    "the procedure of  @xcite consumes eight @xmath16 gates with error @xmath72 to produce a toffoli state with error @xmath76 .",
    "the @xmath16 gates can be implemented using a combination of protocols ; table i of  @xcite lists optimal protocol combinations for a large range of target error rates .",
    "if physical @xmath16 gates can be performed with error at most @xmath77 , then using the toffoli construction of  @xcite , as given , requires on average @xmath78 @xmath16 gates .    alternatively , we could use a @xmath70 $ ] triorthogonal code for distillation at the top level , and use toffoli states from  @xcite as input to implement the @xmath7 gates in  .",
    "the distillation circuit fails to detect a faulty toffoli state input only if the number of errors on each triorthogonal code block is even . to leading order ,",
    "this occurs only if a pair of input toffoli states contain identical errors .",
    "each of the seven possible errors on the output of states from  @xcite are equally likely .",
    "thus , if the input toffoli states have error @xmath79 , then to leading order the failure probability of the triorthogonal protocol is given by @xmath80 .",
    "for @xmath81 , this yields an average @xmath16-gate cost of @xmath82 , a savings of @xmath83% over  @xcite alone .",
    "calculations for a range of target error rates are shown in  .",
    "the average number of physical @xmath16 gates required for three different toffoli state distillation protocols . for the previous protocols of  @xcite and  @xcite ,",
    "input @xmath16 gates are first distilled to the appropriate fidelity according to table i of  @xcite .",
    "the solid black line shows the cost of our protocol for @xmath70 $ ] triorthogonal codes where an even integer @xmath84 has been optimally selected at each target error rate .",
    "input @xmath7 gates to the triorthogonal protocol are produced using  @xcite .",
    "physical @xmath16 gates are assumed to have error at most  @xmath77 . ]",
    "the @xmath16 gate cost alone is an incomplete measure of the overhead . indeed",
    ",   shows that the double error - detecting protocol of  @xcite usually has higher @xmath16 gate cost than the single error - detecting protocol .",
    "however , the double error - detecting protocol can still yield significant savings since smaller code distances may be used for clifford gates in intermediate distillation levels  @xcite .",
    "our protocol similarly allows for reduced clifford gate costs and offers the flexibility to be used recursively or on top of any other toffoli state distillation protocol , including  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "complete overhead calculations depend on architectural considerations .",
    "finally , we note that if the orthogonality conditions on the matrix @xmath22 are increased , then additional types of diagonal operations are transversal .",
    "if @xmath22 satisfies the condition that all @xmath1-tuple products have weight @xmath85 for all @xmath86 , then the @xmath87-fold controlled-@xmath0 gate is transversal in the corresponding stabilizer code .",
    "this observation is similar to a result of landahl and cesare , who demonstrated that codes satisfying increasingly stringent conditions on weights of the codewords admit transversal @xmath0-axis rotations of increasing powers of @xmath88  @xcite .",
