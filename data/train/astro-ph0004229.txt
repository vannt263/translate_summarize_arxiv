    "studies on compact groups ( cgs ) of galaxies mainly concentrate on two issues : 1 ) what is the origin and relative importance of cgs in the universe ?",
    "2 ) is there a relation between the makeup of these structures and the formation and evolution of galaxies which form them ? actually , the possibility that the two issues are connected is what makes cgs so interesting in the first place ( see the review by hickson 1997 ) . now that we have some unambiguous evidence of galaxy evolution driven by dynamical environment effects , even at relatively modest redshifts ( oconnell 1999 , vandokkum et al .",
    "1999 ) , cgs with their high spatial densities and small velocity dispersions look more than ever like the ideal objects to investigate how dynamical effects forge galaxy evolution .",
    "although the first dynamical simulations of cgs predicted that they should evolve within only a few orbital times into a system dominated by one central merger remnant ( barnes 1989 ) , evidence for on  going or post merger events in cgs are scarce ( mardirossian et al .",
    "1982 ; zepf & whitmore 1991 ; zepf 1993 ; moles et al .",
    "the high number of these systems also suggests longer lifetime for cgs , as compared to what is expected based on the small crossing times of the galaxies .",
    "but , these contradictions may only be apparent , due to our still limited knowledge of how mergers really proceed and what kind of remnants they leave behind ( see the review by mihos 1999 ) .",
    "this is the point made by several recent numerical simulations , which show that the evolution of cgs may take more than a few gyrs if they are embedded in massive dark matter halos ( athanassoula et al .",
    "1997 ) or even longer if the merging galaxies had originally a wide range in masses ( governato et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "our difficulties in understanding cgs may also be a consequence of our lack of knowledge of what these structures really are .",
    "short dynamical lifetimes and a high number of cgs , for instance , are not a problem if these structures are collapsing physical systems continuously forming in loose groups ( diaferio et al .  1994 ; governato et al .",
    "this seems to be the converging conclusion of many recent redshift studies of galaxies around compact groups ( garcia 1995 ; ribeiro et al .",
    "1998 ; barton et al .  1998 ) . in ribeiro",
    "et al .  ( 1998 ) , in particular , it was shown that amongst cgs there is a wide range of different dynamical stages , with different surface density profiles ; the core radius increasing from values typical of very compact to loose groups .",
    "these authors confirmed that the fraction of spiral galaxies is lower in cgs than in the field and that it decreases as the velocity dispersion increases ( hickson et al .",
    "1988 ) , suggesting that the environment influenced the formation and/or evolution of the galaxies in the groups . in these structures , interactions and mergers are suggested by the decrease of spiral fraction with the decrease of crossing time and increase of x - ray luminosity ( ponman et al.1996 ) .",
    "the linear relation between velocity dispersion and gas temperature also seems to get steeper in cgs than in cluster , which is consistent with effects of dynamical friction ( bird et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the dynamical evidences in favor of environmental effects , as described above , are consistent with our previous analysis of activity types found in hcgs ( ribeiro et al .",
    "1996 ; coziol et al.1998a , 1998b ; de carvalho & coziol 1999 ) .",
    "we have finds that a significant fraction of the brightest galaxies in the groups displays some sort of activity , either star formation or agn .",
    "we also discovered the presence of a large number of low luminosity agns , making agn the dominant activity type in cgs ( coziol et al.1998a ) .",
    "related to this activity , we find a density  morphology  activity relation , according to which the agns ( low luminosity agns included ) and galaxies without emission lines are the most luminous and invariably early - type galaxies and tend to concentrate in the core of hcgs , while the star  forming galaxies , which may also be preferentially late  type spirals , are more numerous in the halo ( coziol et al .",
    "1998b ) .",
    "despite looking like normal field galaxies with similar morphologies , galaxies in cgs seem to have stellar metallicity that is relatively high for their luminosity .",
    "they also have slightly narrower metal absorption line equivalent widths and relatively strong balmer absorption lines which suggests that a meager extra population of intermediate  age stars is still present ( coziol et al .",
    "this phenomenon may be reminiscent of the `` post  starburst '' phase associated to the butcher  oemler effect ( belloni et al .",
    "1995 ; caldwell & rose 1997 ) .",
    "but , the `` post  starburst '' signs in cg galaxies look weaker than usually observed ( poggianti & barbaro 1996 ; zabludoff et al . 1996 ; leonardi & rose 1996 ) , which suggests a more advanced stage of evolution ( or milder level of past star  forming activity ) for the galaxies in the groups ( caon et al .  1994 ; coziol et al .",
    "1998b ) .",
    "considering the significance of our results for understanding how the environment of galaxies affects their formation and evolution , we believe that it is important to confirm our previous observations on the activity in cgs on a larger and complete sample .",
    "this is the main subject of the present article . in section  2",
    ", we present the new sample of cg galaxies used for our analysis and give some details on their spectroscopic observations . in section  3",
    ", we discuss our classification method and present the results .",
    "a summary of our study and conclusions can be found in section  4 .",
    "with the aim of obtaining a larger and deeper sample of cg of galaxies , iovino & tassi ( 1999 ; hereafter it99 ) , developed an algorithm to search for compact groups of galaxies on digitized galaxy catalog .",
    "the selection criteria used by these authors are slightly different than those used by hickson : the richness and compactness criteria are maintained , while the isolation criterion is relaxed . in formulae ,",
    "the conditions are : 1  richness : @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; 2  compactness : @xmath6 ; 3  isolation : @xmath7 . where @xmath8 is the number of member galaxies , @xmath9 the estimated blue @xmath2 magnitude of the brightest group member , @xmath10 the estimated blue @xmath2 magnitude of the faintest group member ( at most equal to @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 the group radius , corresponding to the smallest circle containing the centers of the group members , and @xmath13 the distance from the center of the group to the nearest non member galaxy within the same magnitude range or brighter .",
    "@xmath14 is the surface brightness of the group ( mag per arcsec@xmath15 ) defined as the total magnitude of all the member galaxies averaged over the circle with radius @xmath13 .",
    "changing from @xmath2 to e , this threshold is equivalent to the one used by hickson , namely 26.0 magnitude per arcsec@xmath15 . as a further constraint",
    ", it is requested that the mean surface brightness in the isolation annulus ( now including galaxies up to 3 magnitudes fainter than the brightest group member ) should be fainter than @xmath16 . having relaxed the isolation constraint , this last measure is necessary to avoid the selection of many sub - condensations within larger structures , clusters .",
    "applying this algorithm to the serc(j ) southern sky survey , digitized by the cosmos plate scanning machine , it99 produced a list of 60 southern cgs ( scgs ) with magnitude of the starting galaxy brighter than 14.5 in @xmath2 on an area of @xmath0 around the south galactic pole .",
    "the spectroscopic follow  up of this sample resulted in the confirmation of 49 groups of galaxies with three or more concordant members . a velocity cut  off of 1000 km / sec from the median velocity of the group was assumed .",
    "in this paper we present the results of the classification of spectral activity types for the 193 galaxies of the 49 concordant groups .",
    "being selected in an automated fashion , such sample is extremely well suited for statistical studies of compact groups properties , as it is unaffected by the biases introduced by visual selection methods ( prandoni 1994 ) .",
    "the material we used for our study is the same material presented in iovino 1999 ( i99 ) , the one collected during the spectroscopic follow  up of scgs .",
    "one should refer to i99 for a detailed log of the observations . here",
    ", it will be enough to remind that the spectroscopic data were all obtained at the 1.5 m eso telescope of la silla , chile , during a series of three observing runs in 1995 ( four nights ) , 1996 ( three nights ) and 1997 ( five nights ) .",
    "the boller&chivens spectrograph was the instrument used , with different ccds and gratings . in 1995",
    "we used the @xmath17 pixels , ccd#24 . during the 1996 and 1997",
    "runs we used instead ccd # 39 , a loral / lesser @xmath18 ccd , whose is twice as efficient as ccd # 24 in the red part of the spectrum , and five times as efficient in the blue end .",
    "both ccd s have pixel size of @xmath19 . during observations , they were windowed in the spatial direction for faster readout .",
    "except for the first night of 1995 , the grating used was always eso # 23 .",
    "this grating , blazed at @xmath20 , yields a pixel size of @xmath21  and gives a wavelength coverage of @xmath22 .",
    "the first night of 1995 run , the grating eso # 2 with a disperson of @xmath23l / mm was used .",
    "blazed at @xmath20 , it gives a pixel size of @xmath24  and a wavelength coverage of @xmath25 .",
    "the slit width was always set to 2@xmath26 throughout the runs , resulting in a spectral resolution of @xmath27  for the spectra taken with grating eso # 23 , and @xmath28  for the spectra taken with grating eso # 2 .",
    "typical exposure times varied from 10 to 30 minutes depending on the magnitude of the galaxy to be observed . because they were taken for kinematics studies , the spectra were not calibrated in flux .",
    "data reduction employed standard routines available in iraf  . following subtraction of bias and dark , flat field correction , and cosmic rays removal , one dimensional spectra were extracted from each frame using the variance weighting option in the task apall .",
    "the classification of activity types of the scg galaxies was done in two steps .",
    "first we identified galaxies with and without line emission .",
    "then , for the emission  line galaxies , we measured various emission line ratios in order to build different standard diagnostic diagrams ( baldwin et al . 1981 ; veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) .",
    "as veilleux et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have shown , it is useful to use more than one diagnostic diagrams to identify `` intermediate '' or ambiguous cases , galaxies where a weak agn or gas excited by shocks could be mixed with star formation ( for more details on this subject see coziol et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we illustrate our spectral classification by showing in figures  1 to 3 examples of galaxies with different activity types .",
    "we separate the spectra into three categories : galaxies without emission , emission  line galaxies ( agns , liners and star forming galaxies ) and low  luminosity agns .",
    "some spectra of non  emission  line galaxies are presented in figure  1a .",
    "the spectra of these galaxies are similar to those of elliptical and early  type spiral galaxies .",
    "they show a mixture of old and intermediate age stellar populations , as judged by the strength of the balmer lines in absorption and the amplitude of the balmer jump around 4000 .    among the emission ",
    "line galaxies , we distinguish between galaxies with star formation in their nucleus and galaxies where the gas is excited by an agn ( liner and seyfert 2 ) .",
    "the spectral characteristic which separates agns from star forming galaxies is more intense forbidden lines , like [ ] @xmath29 , [ ] @xmath30 and ] @xmath31 .",
    "liners ( figure  2 a - b ) are discriminated from seyfert 2 galaxies ( figure 2e - f ) by their low level of excitation . in many cases ,",
    "however , the differentiation between these two types of agns is not obvious ( figure 2c - d ) and can be made only after comparing different line ratios using standard diagnostic diagrams ( see next section ) .",
    "we present in figure  3 , some spectra of star forming galaxies in our sample .",
    "these galaxies usually show a featureless continuum and strong emission lines . in the scgs , we distinguish two types of star forming galaxies .",
    "the first type ( figure  3 a - b ) have a high excitation level ( [ ] @xmath32 h@xmath33 ) and a relatively low ratio [ ] @xmath29/h@xmath34 , similar to what is observed in normal regions in the disk of late  type spirals or in irregular galaxies .",
    "the strong intensity of the h@xmath34 line suggests that they experience a relatively high level of star formation .",
    "the second type of star forming galaxies have a low level of excitation and weak h@xmath34 emission , which suggests that they have lower star formation than the other star  forming galaxies ( figure  3 c - d ) . the second type of star forming galaxies also show unusually intense [ ] @xmath29 and [ ] @xmath30 as compared to h@xmath34 . as we will show later , these spectral characteristics are specific to nucleus galaxies ( kennicutt , keel & blaha 1989 ; coziol 1996 ; ho et al .",
    "the discrimination between star forming galaxies and liners is not always obvious , and can be achieved only using standard diagnostic diagrams .",
    "this is particularly true for nucleus galaxies , as we will see in the next section",
    ".    a significant fraction of galaxies in scgs can not be easily classified .",
    "the spectra of some of these galaxies are presented in figure  1 c - d .",
    "they show spectral characteristics which are similar to those of non  emission  line galaxies ( compare figure 1 a with figure  1 c ) , with the difference that they also show the presence of some emission lines .",
    "the more intense of these lines , and in many cases the only one visible , is [ ] @xmath29 .",
    "this phenomenon was already observed in cgs and was shown to be related to the low ",
    "luminosity agn phenomenon ( coziol et al .",
    "1998a ) . in a galaxy with a low  luminosity agn ,",
    "the faint emission components originating from the nucleus are severely diluted by absorption features produced by intermediate mass stars present in the bulge .",
    "the resulting emission line spectra of these galaxies is one where the two principal balmer emission lines are notably weak : h@xmath33 usually appears in absorption , while h@xmath34 sometimes appears in emission , but always with an apparent intensity ratio [ ] @xmath29/h@xmath35 . in coziol",
    "( 1998a ) we have demonstrated that after subtracting a template to eliminate the dilution effect , these galaxies are invariably classified as agns ( seyfert or liners , but mostly liners ) with a low luminosity ( filippenko & sargent 1985 ; phillips et al .",
    "1986 ) .    examining the optical spectral atlas of ho et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , one can verify that this phenomenon is very common in the nuclei of luminous nearby galaxies .",
    "the spectral characteristics of this class of objects are well defined ( see description above ) and easy to recognized by a trained eye . as a test",
    ", we verified that all the galaxies in the spectral atlas presented by ho et al .",
    "( 1995 ) selected as low ",
    "luminosity agns candidates by just applying the phenomenological description given above were actually classified as such by ho et al .",
    "( 1998 ) after template subtraction .",
    "based on this verification and on our previous experience dealing with low ",
    "luminosity agns in cgs ( coziol et al .",
    "1998a ) , we therefore feel confident in classifying also as low  luminosity agns the small fraction of galaxies ( 22% ) in our sample showing the same typical spectral pattern ( the low signal to noise ratios of our spectra do not allow us to subtract a template ) .",
    "the scg galaxies with their activity types are presented in table  1 . the whole sample is constituted of 193 galaxies distributed in 49 cgs with 3 to 6 members . following the name of the groups , we give for each galaxy its blue ( @xmath2 ) cosmos magnitude and its morphology .",
    "errors in magnitude in the cosmos catalogue are smaller than 0.2 down to @xmath36 ( macgillivray & yentis 1993 ) . the morphologies were determined by visual inspection of our own r band ccd images of these groups .",
    "the activity types are described as the following : non  emission  line galaxies ( no em . ) , low ",
    "luminosity agns ( llagns ) , liners , seyfert 2 ( sy2 ) and star forming galaxies ( sfgs ) . our classification as liners , seyfert 2 or sfgs was established using three standard diagnostic diagrams ( next section ) . a small number of galaxies in our sample show emission lines similar to sfgs , but can not be classified because their spectra do not have a sufficiently high s / n ratio ( generally in the blue part of the spectra ) . in table",
    "1 , they are identified as emlgs .    it is remarkable that we find mostly liners and seyfert 2 galaxies in our sample . the only galaxies which resemble a seyfert  1 is scg 0421 - 5624b .",
    "the spectrum of this galaxy is shown in figure  4 .",
    "the h@xmath34 emission line may have a wider base ( @xmath37  , see figure  4c ) .",
    "this large component , however , is not obvious in h@xmath33 ( cf .",
    "figure  2b ) .",
    "we note also that the two forbidden lines , [ ] @xmath38 may have the same width as h@xmath33 , a characteristic proper to a seyfert 2 .",
    "this observation is not conclusive , however , because of a peculiar double peaks observed in these lines .",
    "this feature appear in three different spectra taken in different nights , which suggests that it is real .",
    "it is possible that we are seeing more than one emission region in this galaxy . in this case",
    ", the superposition of these regions would artificially enlarge the forbidden lines in our spectrum and gives an erroneous identification as a seyfert 2 .",
    "more observations are needed to settle this question .      for classification purposes , we measured up to six different line ratios . using the package splot in iraf ,",
    "the intensities of the lines were determined by fitting a gaussian .",
    "the level of the continuum was estimated using two regions @xmath39 100   wide on each side of the line .",
    "for the emission lines which are slightly blended , like h@xmath34 + [ ] and the two sulphur lines , the intensities were determined after fitting gaussians using the `` deblend '' option in splot .",
    "the measurements of emission line ratios are sensitive to the dilution introduced by balmer absorption lines , produced by intermediate ",
    "age stellar populations present in the bulge of the galaxies . to correct for this dilution effect",
    ", a template galaxy spectrum is usually subtracted from the spectra ( veilleux et al.1995 ; ho et al .",
    "1997 ; coziol et al .",
    "however , the relatively low signal to noise ratios of our spectra impede us to apply this technique in the present study . to correct for this effect , we used , therefore , an alternative method , which consists in adding a constant equivalent width to the equivalent widths of all the emission lines measured ( see contini et al .",
    "1995 for an explanation ) . to determine the ew value to add to our galaxies and to verify the accuracy of this method , we first applied it to the sample of hcg emission ",
    "line galaxies previously studied by coziol et al .",
    "( 1998a ) and compared the results with those previously obtained after a template subtraction .",
    "we verified that by adding a constant ew of 1  , we can reproduce the results obtained after template subtraction . in agns , however , we found that the correction for ew(h@xmath33 ) implied by the standard correction method is unrealistically high .",
    "this effect is caused by the extreme narrowness of ew(h@xmath33 ) observed in these galaxies .",
    "this happens because in some cases ( mostly in seyfert 2 ) h@xmath33 is so severely affected by dilution that we can not measure it correctly .",
    "the badly measured h@xmath33 line yields an unusually narrow ew , which automatically translates into a large correction factor ( the correction factor varies as 1/ew ) . to overcome this problem",
    ", we used an empirical relation to deduce the observed ew in h@xmath33 from the one observed in h@xmath34 ( sodr and stasiska 1999 ) .",
    "we verified that this relation works well both for agns and star forming galaxies .",
    "for consistence sake , therefore , we decided to use it to deduce the observed value of ew(h@xmath33 ) in all the emission line galaxies in our sample .",
    "the corrected emission line ratios are presented in table  2 .",
    "the uncertainties ( @xmath40 ) on these values were determined assuming poisson statistics and applying standard error propagation formula . from these measurements",
    "we deduce , in table  3 , the ratios h@xmath34/h@xmath33 from which we estimate the total ( galactic@xmath41internal ) extinction , e(b - v ) , using the whitford reddening curve as parametrized by miller and mathews ( 1972 ) .",
    "we adopted an intrinsic h@xmath34/h@xmath33 ratio of 2.86 for sfgs and 3.10 for agns . the extinction corrected emission ",
    "line ratios are given in columns 4 to 9 followed by the ew in h@xmath34 in column 10 .",
    "a detailed classification of the activity types is given in the last column of table  3 .",
    "the main types are : star forming galaxies ( h ) , liner ( l ) or seyfert ( sy ) . to determine the activity type of our galaxies we followed the same criteria as ho et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "the logarithm of the line ratios adopted to distinguish between the different activity types are listed in table  4 .",
    "generally we give the classification suggested by more than one line ratios .",
    "when the classification is ambiguous , we usually adopt the activity type suggested by [ ] @xmath31/h@xmath34 or by [ ] ( @xmath42)/h@xmath34 , when [ ] is not measured . in table  3 ,",
    "a `` ? '' indicates that our classification is tentative , because it is based on only one line ratio .",
    "a `` : '' indicates an ambiguous nature for the galaxy , that is , galaxy with different classifications in different diagnostic diagrams .",
    "the high number of ambiguous cases in our sample of emission  line galaxies is quite remarkable ( 31% of our galaxies , as compared to 19% in the sample of veilleux et al .",
    "1995 ) . in part",
    ", this ambiguity may be due to the method we used to correct for the contamination by the stellar bulge population .",
    "this method was shown to work well when applied to galaxies with intense star formation like in disk hii regions and starburst galaxies ( mc call , rybsky & shields 1985 ; liu & kennicutt 1995 ; veilleux et al .",
    "1995 ; contini et al . 1998 ) . however , its usage can be more problematic when star formation is at a lower level than in these galaxies or there maybe more than one source of ionization of the gas , like in seyfert and liner galaxies .",
    "we examine these questions further below .",
    "the results of our classification of scg galaxies in terms of the three diagnostic diagrams are shown in figure  5 .",
    "one can see ( figure  5a ) that some sfgs and liners have nitrogen ratios which are different than usually expected for these kind of galaxies . in figure  5b",
    ", we observe the same behavior : some liners have sulphur line ratios similar to sfgs , while some scg sfgs show unusually strong sulphur lines .",
    "the separation of liner and sfgs is clearer in figure  5c , reflecting the fact that we used preferentially this diagram to classify our galaxies .    from the analysis of 200 luminous infrared galaxies , veilleux et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have shown that in 81% of the cases the diagnostic diagram [ ] @xmath43/h@xmath33 vs [ ] @xmath29/h@xmath34 is sufficient to classify without ambiguity the activity types of the galaxies . using two other diagnostic diagrams , namely [ ] @xmath43/h@xmath33 vs [ ] ( @xmath42)/h@xmath34 and [ ] @xmath43/h@xmath33 vs [ ] @xmath31/h@xmath34 , they found only 19% of galaxies with an `` ambiguous '' classification , that is , they show different activity types in different diagnostic diagrams .",
    "the same result was recently found by contini et al .",
    "( 1998 ) using a sample of 105 barred sfgs , and in general , for most emission ",
    "line galaxies ambiguous classification seems rare ( vron et al .",
    "1997 ; coziol et al .",
    "1999 ) . in their sample of 418 `` normal '' galaxies more luminous than b@xmath44 , ho et al .",
    "( 1997a , 1997b ) found a much larger number of galaxies with ambiguous classification using standard diagnostic diagrams .",
    "these star  forming galaxies usually have anomalous strengths of low  ionization lines .",
    "they associated this behavior to the nucleus galaxies phenomenon ( kennicutt et al .",
    "1989 ; coziol 1996 ) . in figure  5",
    ", we show that most of the scg sfgs do occupy in these diagrams the nucleus galaxies regions ( the gray areas in figure  5b and 5c ) .",
    "it seems , therefore , that the ambiguity of the galaxies in our sample can be explained simply if they are , in fact , nucleus galaxies .    in coziol ( 1996 )",
    "it was shown that the star formation in the nucleus galaxies is generally at a lower level than in starburst galaxies .",
    "therefore , we can use a star formation indicator like ew(h@xmath34 ) to sheck if the galaxies in our sample are nucleus galaxies . in figure 6 , we show the distribution of ew(h@xmath34 ) for all the emission ",
    "line galaxies in our sample . in this figure",
    ", we do not include the galaxy scg 0105 - 1744ac , which , with an h@xmath34 equivalent width of 290 , is an obvious starburst galaxy .",
    "the rest of the scg sfgs , on the other hand , have relatively narrow equivalent width .",
    "these values are typical of nucleus galaxies ( coziol 1996 ) , supporting , therefore , our interpretation .    as for the nature of nucleus galaxies and the origin of their peculiar spectral characteristics ,",
    "kennicutt et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and gonalvez et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggested that they could be a sort of intermediate type galaxies , where star formation and agn activity coexist in their nucleus . to test this hypothesis ,",
    "we have plotted in figure  7 the diagnostic diagram [ ] @xmath45/[]@xmath43 vs. [ ] @xmath31/[]@xmath43 for the scg galaxies .",
    "this diagram was originally used by heckman ( 1980 ) to define the liner type . in this figure ,",
    "the horizontal and vertical lines indicate the separations , as defined by heckman , between seyfert 2 and liners . the areas in gray define schematically the locus occupied by seyfert 2 ( sy2 ) , liners and transition type galaxies ( t ) . for comparison",
    ", we also included in this figure starburst galaxies as observed by veilleux et al .",
    "( 1995 ) as well as data for normal regions as observed by van zee et al .",
    "the differences between these different samples are interesting .",
    "the position of the few scg that we can put on this plot is quite distant from the locus of normal hii regions and starburst .",
    "they all fall in the liner region or in the transition region between seyfert 2 and liners , consistent with the interpretation of kennicutt et al .",
    "1989 and gonalvez et al .",
    "1999 for the nucleus galaxies .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this result does not depend neither on the way our spectra were corrected for the dilution effect ( the forbidden lines are not affected by the underlying stellar populations ) nor on the amount of reddening present .",
    "it is therefore safe to assert that in the scgs sample most of the galaxies do not show strong star forming activity , neither the typical behavior of normal hii regions , but possibly a mixture of star formation and agn activity , as indicated by figure 7 .    regarding the location of the activity in the agn , llagn , and hii nucleus galaxy candidates , it is important to mention that our spectroscopic observations cover the most luminous part of the galaxies and are centered on the nucleus suggesting that the peculiar phenomena we observe is located in these regions of the galaxies .",
    "however , we lack the spatial resolution to say that this is strickly a nucleus phenomenon . in coziol",
    "et al . ( 1998a ) , it was verified that after a template subtraction , the line ratios and equivalent widths of llagn are consistent with those of liners and seyfert galaxies .",
    "this phenomenon is also frequently observed in the nucleus of normal elliptical and s0 galaxies ( rubin et al .",
    "therefore , for these objects , it seems that we are dealing with a nuclear phenomenon .",
    "but for the star forming galaxies the situation is still unclear .",
    "these systems seem to show an excess of excitation suggesting some kind of transition phase between liners and starburst . in these cases",
    ", we can not conclude that this extra excitation is concentrated ( or have its origin ) in the nucleus .",
    "we have already found similar ambiguous situations in hcg 16 ( see de carvalho & coziol 1999 ) .",
    "more observations will be necessary to settle this important question .      in this section , we proceed to verify if our classification of activity types in the scgs sample is consistent with what was observed previously in the hcgs sample .",
    "we also verify if we recognize the same luminosity  activity and morphology  activity found in these compact groups ( coziol et al .",
    "1998a ) .",
    "in table  6 , we compare the frequencies of the different activity types as observed in the hcgs and in the scgs . for this analysis , we added the few ( 5% ) emlgs in table  1 to the sfgs .",
    "for the hcgs , we give both the frequencies for the groups and the core . according to our interpretation of the core and halo structure in cgs ( ribeiro et al .",
    "1998 ; coziol et al .",
    "1998a ) , and considering the criteria to select the scgs , our results should be similar mostly to those of the core of the hcgs . in table  6",
    ", we can see that the distribution of activity types observed in the scgs is comparable to the one found in the hcgs cores .",
    "in particular , low luminosity agns and agns are , as for the hcg cores , the most numerous activity types found in scgs ( 41% of the cases ) .",
    "we note however an interesting difference with the hcg sample : the number of sfgs is larger while the number of non  emission galaxies is lower .",
    "we look now for the presence of a luminosity  activity relation in scgs . according to the relation found for the hcgs",
    ", we expect to see the low luminosity agns and agns preferentially located in the most luminous galaxies in the groups , while the non  emission  line galaxies and the sfgs should share a common distribution among the less luminous galaxies .",
    "figure  8 shows the luminosity distribution for the scgs galaxies . comparing figure  8a with figure  8b",
    ", we do see a clear tendency for the low luminosity agns and agns to be located in the more luminous galaxies of the groups .",
    "this tendency is reinforced when we consider in figures 8c and 8d the groups with only 4 or more members .",
    "this is similar to the luminosity segregation previously observed in hcgs .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test was performed on the magnitude distributions of the different types .",
    "the results are presented in table  7 .",
    "it gives the probabilities that the different types of galaxies come from the same distribution .",
    "these results support the interpretation that agn and llagn in scgs share the same magnitude distribution .",
    "however , they do not support the interpretation that the non emission line galaxies and the sfgs come from the same distribution .",
    "the sfgs seem clearly different from the other types of galaxies .",
    "finally , we show in figure  9 the distribution of the morphologies in the scgs . for the hcgs a morphology  activity relation links the non  emission  line galaxies , low luminosity agns and agns to the most early  type galaxies and the sfgs to the late  type ones .",
    "this result holds independently from the core  halo structure found in cgs .",
    "this trend is confirmed also in our sample .",
    "in particular we confirm that the sfgs are located mostly in late  type spiral galaxies .",
    "we also observe another difference between the scgs and hcgs : a larger number of low luminosity agns in the scgs are in early  type spirals ( sa and sab ) .    from the above comparisons ,",
    "we conclude that we observe in the scgs the same characteristic activity trends as in the hcgs .",
    "the scgs are dominated by agns and galaxies without emission , and the agns are located in the most luminous and early  type galaxies of the group .",
    "we confirm also that the sfgs are located mostly in late ",
    "type spiral galaxies .",
    "but we also observe some interesting differences between the scgs and the hcgs .",
    "the scgs contain more sfgs and less galaxies without emission than the hcgs .",
    "the scgs contain also more llagns in spirals than the hcgs .",
    "these differences may be interpreted in different ways .",
    "if cgs are real structures evolving by interaction , we should then expect the less evolved structures to be those richer in spirals and sfgs .",
    "the differences between the scgs and hcgs could have , therefore , a physical origin : the scgs contain less evolved systems than the hcgs .",
    "the difference between the two samples could be explained by the biases affecting the hcgs sample .",
    "being selected in an automated way , the scgs probe a wider range of physical properties than the hcgs , whose selection biases favor groups with extreme properties , denser and more evolved , because more easily detectable being more prominent on the plates .",
    "alternatively , the scgs may also contain more sfgs than the hcgs because they are more severely affected by projection effects . the fact that most of the sfgs are actually nucleus galaxies and that these galaxies are very common in loose groups ( ho et al .",
    "1997a ) may support this alternative .    to test the different hypothesis , we present in the last column of table  6 , the activity frequency in the scgs with four or more members .",
    "we see a significant increase of galaxies without emission accompanied by a comparable decrease of the number of sfgs .",
    "the larger number of sfgs in the scgs seems , therefore , to be due to their preponderance in the subset of groups with only 3 concordant members .",
    "it is difficult , however , to discriminate if this is due to an evolution or to a projection effect , as the probability of having a projection group increases when the number of members decreases . to help disentangle the above problem",
    ", we can look at the activity  type association in the scgs .",
    "if compact groups are projection effects within loose groups , then the majority of those with three members should be mostly composed of sfgs .",
    "but , out of the 16 triplets in our sample , only two contain three sfgs .",
    "considering our whole sample , only 22% contain a majority of sfgs ( compared to 44% in the triplets ) .",
    "in general , the groups with sfgs also include llagns ( 47% ) or galaxies without emission ( 55% ) .",
    "although , the above results do not completely exclude projections , they suggest that this is probably not the only reason for the differences observed between the scgs and the hcgs . the scgs sample ,",
    "therefore , may also includes a greater fraction of groups which are relatively less evolved than in the hcgs .    as a last point , there are probably very simple reasons why we did not discover the predominance of nuclear galaxies among the sfgs in our previous survey of 17 hcgs .",
    "first , our previous survey did not include emission lines like [ ] @xmath45 or emission line ratios like [ ] /h@xmath34 .",
    "our sample was also smaller and contaminated by sfgs from the halo of the groups , where this phenomenon may be less pronounced .",
    "our sample contain also the galaxies in hcg 16 , which are unusually active in star formation ( ribeiro et al .",
    "1996 ; de carvalho & coziol 1999 )",
    ". however , a careful examination of our previous observations in hcgs does reveal many peculiar characteristics ( coziol et al .",
    "all the line ratios of the hcgs sfgs are consistent with those of nucleus galaxies .",
    "many of these galaxies also have relatively strong [ ] @xmath31 lines as compared to starburst galaxies and some show [ ] @xmath31/h@xmath34 suggesting an ambiguous nature ( starburst  liner ) . finally , in general in the hcgs , the h@xmath34 fwhm of the sfgs are unusually large for starburst galaxies ( coziol et al .",
    "1998b ) . even in hcg 16 ,",
    "where star formation is at a higher level than in any other hcgs , we see some evidence of an ambiguous nature in some galaxies : hcg16 - 1 is a liner with a circumnuclear starburst , while hcg16 - 5 have a mixture of agn and star formation in its nucleus ( de carvalho & coziol 1999 ) .",
    "selection biases favoring more evolved groups in the hcgs sample would also have rendered evidence of the predominance of nuclear galaxies less obvious in our first sample .",
    "we have presented the results of the classification of the level of activity of 193 galaxies in a new sample of 49 cgs of galaxies observed in the southern hemisphere .",
    "this analysis confirms the results previously obtained from a smaller sample of 17 hcgs .",
    "* we show that agn ( including low luminosity agn ) is the most frequent ( 41% ) activity type encountered in cgs .",
    "we found however more sfgs and less non  emission  line galaxies in the scgs than in the hcgs .",
    "we suggest that these differences could be explained by the visual biases affecting the hcg sample .",
    "the scgs sample , filling completely the parameter space allowed by the criteria used for the search , contain groups with a broader range of properties than the hcgs sample , and therefore groups whose properties ( spatial density ) are less extreme than those of hcgs .",
    "* we confirm the luminosity  activity and morphology  activity relation previously observed in hcgs : 1 ) low luminosity agns and agns are preferentially located in the most luminous galaxies in the groups , while non  emission  line galaxies and sfgs share a common distribution among the less luminous galaxies ; 2 ) the non  emission  line galaxies , the low luminosity agns and agns are more common in early  type galaxies while sfgs are preferentially located in late  type spirals .",
    "* we find a strong variation of the dominant activity type with the increase of galaxies members in the group : the number of non  emission  line galaxies increases while the number of sfgs decreases .",
    "but what truly characterizes cgs seems to be the association of one or more sfgs with more evolved or active galaxies ( low luminosity agns , liners or seyfert 2 ) .",
    "it is quite rare to find a group composed only of sfgs , which suggests that what we are looking at is really a physical entity , and not just a projection effect within loose groups . *",
    "the star  forming galaxies in cgs are mostly nucleus galaxies . as these galaxies are characterized by having low star formation activity ( coziol 1996 )",
    ", we conclude that the star formation level in cgs is generally low .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the recent results on star formation obtained by severgnini et al .",
    "( 1999 ) based on an h@xmath46 $ ] imaging survey in 31 hcgs . comparing the distribution in h@xmath47 [ ] ew measured by these last authors with the distribution presented in coziol ( 1996 ) for the nucleus galaxies ( multiplying by 0.66 to 0.5 to take into account the unusual strengths of the nitrogen lines in these galaxies )",
    ", one can see that they are fully consistent .",
    "* we also see in the nucleus galaxies a clear evidence for non stellar activity .",
    "if the transition nature of these galaxies is taken as a sign of agn activity , then cgs would be exceptionally rich in agns .",
    "more than 70% of the galaxies in the scgs would have an agn nature ( adding the sfgs to the agns and llagns ) .",
    "the agn nature of these galaxies , however , must be confirmed , as alternatives , like shocks produced by supernovae or excess of excited gas in the disk could also be valid .    to understand which mechanisms in cgs produce",
    "the phenomena described above is not an easy task .",
    "as was already observed ( coziol 1998a ; 1998b ) , we can not relate directly the high density in compact groups of galaxies to an increase ( or decrease ) of star formation or to an increase of nuclear activity .",
    "what we observe instead is a sort of density  morphology  activity relation .",
    "the reason for this multiple relation may have something to do with the history of galaxies in cgs and the mechanisms by which these systems form .    the dynamical analysis of ribeiro et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and barton et al .",
    "( 1998 ) reveal that most of the compact groups are some sort of substructure of larger structures .",
    "these substructures are not all at the same dynamical evolutionary stage .",
    "some may already be in dynamical equilibrium while others are still replenished in spiral galaxies , which fall from the larger structure where they first formed ( diaferio et al .",
    "1994 ; governato et al .",
    "this is specially true for scgs , where the spread in physical properties is bound to be larger than that of the hcgs .    according to the scenario of sub  clustering in loose groups ( diaferio et al .",
    "1994 ) , during the expansion and collapse of gravitating systems subclumps form and merge in a hierarchical manner .",
    "the subclumps are often bound and can be identified with compact groups . in their models , diaferio et al .",
    "1994 have found that most of the subclumps contain 2 or 3 galaxies .",
    "the frequency for groups with 4 and 5 galaxies are , at maximum , 34% and 12% , respectively .",
    "these numbers are comparable to what we find : 46% and 13% scgs have 4 and 5 members , respectively . however , to be consistent with the simulations done by diaferio et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , the loose groups where scg would have formed would need to be richer in galaxies .",
    "loose groups with 15 and 30 galaxies are necessary to reproduce our observations . in their study of poor groups with diffuse x - ray , zabludoff & mulchaey ( 1998 ) find a number of galaxies between 20 and 50 .",
    "barton et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , on the other hand , have found more heterogeneous environments , the number of galaxies in their sample varying between 5 members up to the population of rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "it is not clear which results are representative of the environment of cgs in general , but it seems that the diaferio et al .",
    "scenario of sub  clustering could a good working hypothesis .",
    "however , there could be a serious problem with the sub  clustering scenario , in the relatively short lifetime it predicts for these systems .",
    "after @xmath48gyr the galaxies should all merge . in the diaferio",
    "simulations , cgs are currently forming and , consequently , are not sufficiently evolved to contain a large number of merger remnants . this in contradiction with the advance level of evolution of the galaxies usually found in the core of cgs ( coziol et al .",
    "1998a ; 1998b ) .",
    "this fast merger scenario is also in contradiction with our observation of the variation of activity status of the galaxies with the number of group members : the groups which have a high number of galaxies are also the ones which are more evolved and less active . furthermore , while the diaferio et al .",
    "model correctly predicts that the more massive galaxies form the cgs , it does not explain how these galaxies were allowed to grow in mass .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that mergers must have taken place sometime in the evolution of these structures to produce both the more massive and early  type galaxies necessary to form the core of the groups .",
    "but , as we have emphasized before , signs of mergers are generally scarce , and in the more evolved galaxies in the groups star formation activity has probably ceased more than 2 gyrs ago ( caon et al .",
    "1994 ; coziol et al .",
    "it seems , therefore , that another parameter is missing in our present history of the formation of these structures which would allow galaxies to survive merging .",
    "the replenishment scenario ( governato et al . 1996 ) offers one simple solution to the fast merger problem . according to this scenario , if cgs are so conspicious it is because they are continuously replenished by galaxies falling into their core .",
    "now , if we assume that the infalling galaxies are preferentially late ",
    "type sfgs , we would then expect to find a high number of these galaxies in each group if replenishment is important .",
    "moreover , these infalling galaxies should be associated preferentially with galaxies with more evolved characteristics .",
    "we have verified that late ",
    "type sfgs are indeed present in 80% of the groups .",
    "we have also shown that they are preferentially associated to other activity types , in particular llagns and no  emission line galaxies which are the more evolved galaxies in cgs .",
    "this supports the idea that replenishment is an important aspect of the compact group phenomenon ( governato et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "according to the replenishment scenario , the sfgs would be `` now '' falling into the core of the groups . by doing so",
    ", they will interact with the group as a whole , but possibly also with individual galaxies . for cgs",
    ", the models describing these interactions should explain both the small amount of star formation observed in these galaxies and the activation of non  thermal process .",
    "simulations of low  velocity galaxy  galaxy interaction have shown that the majority of galaxy  galaxy encounters lead to normal ",
    "star forming properties and that the triggering of very active starbursts are rare events ( mihos , richstone & bothun 1991 ; 1992 ) . in some of the closest encounters star formation could even be inhibited as a result of mass loss from the disk ( by tidal tails ) or perturbations that increase the disk gas scale height ( mihos , richstone & bothun 1991 ) . only mergers ,",
    "seem to be able to increase significantly the star formation rate in interacting galaxies ( mihos , richstone & bothun 1992 ) . at first",
    ", these results seem consistent with the low star formation observed in cgs",
    ". the small number of starburst galaxies in these systems could also be the result of rare mergers , as it is clearly suggested for some galaxies in hcg 16 . according to the simulations ,",
    "however , low  velocity galaxy  galaxy interactions would systematically produce morphological evidences ( howard et al . 1993 ) .",
    "although we do see peculiarities in some of the sfgs , morphological distortions are not always present . according to simulations , it is also very difficult to induce star formation in the nucleus of galaxies by galaxy  galaxy interaction .",
    "even more so to move the gas toward the center to feed a possible agn .    considering that gravitational forces are additive , it is probably more realistic to assume that a galaxy which is falling into the core of the group will first interact with the potential of the group as a whole . in the literature , one can find many models explaining how environmental effects may change the evolution of galaxies falling into rich clusters .",
    "some of the mechanisms proposed in these models may also apply to galaxies in cgs . in some aspects",
    ", cgs do resemble rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "the density of galaxies in the core of cgs , for instance , is comparable to those in clusters . on other aspects ,",
    "however , cgs are quite distincts .",
    "the galaxies in cgs , in particular , have smaller velocity  dispersions and there is much less galaxies in number .",
    "the differences should limit the efficiencies of the possible mechanisms in rich clusters and produce some notable differences .",
    "the effect of tidal interaction between cluster gravitational potential and a disk galaxy was studied by merritt ( 1982 ; 1983 ) , byrd & valtonen 1990 , henriksen & byrd ( 1996 ) and more recently fujita ( 1998 ) . according to merritt ( 1982 ; 1983 ) a galaxy falling into a rich cluster",
    "will have its outer parts rapidly stripped away by the tidal field .",
    "but , before tidal stripping becomes effective , the perturbation produced by the tidal field can also trigger an inflow of gas toward the center of the galaxies which may either feed an agn ( byrd & valtonen 1990 ) or start a burst of star formation ( henriksen & byrd 1996 ; fujita 1998 ) . using a simple point ",
    "mass model , byrd & valtonen ( 1990 ) have shown that infall of matter happens long before tidal stripping in the disk becomes effective .",
    "therefore , gas rich spiral falling into the group will become active long before reaching the center .",
    "the consequences of this model are interesting . among other things",
    ", it predicts that cgs should have a halo of sfgs or even starburst galaxies around them .",
    "when the spiral galaxies enter the core of the group , tidal stripping becomes effective and the disks loose part of their gas ( hutchmeieir 1997 ) .",
    "tidal stripping will not touch the molecular gas which have formed in the center of the galaxy ( verdes  montenegro 1997 ; leon et al .",
    "1998 ) , but it will stop the infall of gas and decrease the star formation in the disk .",
    "the galaxies may then resemble an nucleus galaxies , with a small residual of star formation and non thermal activity in their nucleus .",
    "if the source of the non thermal activity is the feeding of an agn in the center of the galaxies , the question which naturally arise is why is the formation of seyfert 1 inhibited in cgs ?",
    "one reason may be because the infall of gas is followed automatically by star formation . the agn would then have to compete with star formation for the gas ( de carvalho & coziol 1999 ) . when star formation decreases , a low luminosity agn then becomes apparent .",
    "tidal triggering added to tidal gas stripping will combine their effects to transform late type spirals into early  type ones .",
    "triggered star formation in the nucleus of the galaxies increase their bulge in mass and light , while gas stripping makes them loose their disk .",
    "although such a scenario seems viable , an important caveat is the fact that the total mass involved in cgs are small compared to those of rich clusters , making the efficiency of these transformations quite low , which could explain why a significant fraction of cgs are still dominated by spiral galaxies .",
    "other mechanisms could be important in rich cluster of galaxies but probably do not take place in compact groups .",
    "these are ram pressure gas stripping and galaxy harassment .",
    "ram pressure gas stripping should be less efficient in cgs , since it increase as @xmath49 . although cgs may exhibit x - ray luminosities similar to clusters ( ponman et al .",
    "1996 ) , the velocity dispersions are much smaller .",
    "galaxy harassment ( moore , lake & katz 1998 ; lake .",
    "katz & moore 1998 ) , on the other hand , needs frequent collisions at high speeds , which is difficult to achieve in cgs , where galaxies have lower velocity and there are also much fewer galaxies to interact with .",
    "comparison of the evolution of cgs galaxies with those in rich clusters may allow to distinguish the specific signatures of these two particular mechanisms in rich cluster of galaxies .",

    "<S> the spectral analysis of the scg galaxies confirms the results previously obtained from the observation of a smaller sample of 17 cgs in hickson s sample ( hcg ) . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the luminosity  activity and morphology  activity relations previously observed in hcgs : 1 ) low luminosity agns and agns are preferentially located in the most luminous galaxies in the groups , while non  emission  line galaxies and star  forming galaxies share a common distribution among the less luminous galaxies ; 2 ) the non  emission  line galaxies , the low luminosity agns and agns are nearly all in early  type galaxies , while the star  forming galaxies </S>",
    "<S> are preferentially located in late  type spirals . </S>",
    "<S> we also verified that the number of `` evolved '' galaxies ( early  type non  emission  line galaxies ) significantly increases with the number of members in the group . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we confirm that agns ( including low luminosity or dwarf agns ) are the most frequent ( 41% ) activity type encountered in cgs .    </S>",
    "<S> the scgs contain more star  forming galaxies and less non  emission  line galaxies than hcgs . </S>",
    "<S> this difference is possibly related to the different selection criteria of scgs with respect to hcgs . </S>",
    "<S> being selected in an automated way , the scgs probe a wider range of physical properties than the hcgs , which are biased towards more easily detectable , denser and therefore more evolved groups .    the star  </S>",
    "<S> forming galaxies in scgs are composed of few starburst galaxies and a higher number of nucleus galaxies , which generally have less intense star formation than starburst galaxies . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the star formation activity in scgs is remarkably low . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , we found clear evidence for nuclear activity in all the star  forming galaxies . adding up the percentage of agns and star  forming galaxies showing evidence of nuclear activity </S>",
    "<S> would result in more than 70% of the galaxies in scgs having an active nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> if these results are further confirmed , cgs will be in the local universe the best location where to find agns . </S>",
    "<S> curiously , however , this characteristic of cgs generally excludes seyfert 1 galaxies . </S>"
