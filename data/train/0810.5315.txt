    "systems operating far from thermodynamic equilibrium are usually subjected to the action of noise which may profoundly influence their performance . over the past two decades the extensive theoretical and experimental studies in physics ,",
    "information theory and biology have documented various phenomena of noise - induced order , noise - facilitated kinetics or noise - improved signal transmission and detection .",
    "almost all research in this field assumes that the noise process involved can be characterized by finite variance . yet , in many situations the external non - thermal noise can be described by distribution of impulses following the heavy - tail stable law statistics of infinite variance .",
    "notably , infinite variance does not exclude finite spread or dispersion of the distribution around its modal value .",
    "in fact , for the family of @xmath0-stable noises the interquantile distance can be used as a proper measure of the distribution width around the median .",
    "dynamical description of the system and its surroundings is typically carried out within a stochastic picture based on langevin equations @xcite .",
    "the basic equation of this type reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the deterministic ( and possibly time - dependent ) `` force '' acting on the system and @xmath3 stands for the `` noise '' contribution describing interaction between the system and its complex surrounding .",
    "if the noise can be considered as white and gaussian , the above equation gives rise to the classical langevin approach used in the analysis of brownian motion .",
    "the whiteness of the noise ( lack of temporal correlations ) corresponds to the existence of time - scale separation between the dynamics of a relevant variable of interest @xmath4 and the typical time scale of the noise .",
    "hence white noise can be considered as a standard stochastic process that describes in the simplest fashion the effects of `` fast '' surroundings @xcite .",
    "although in various phenomena , the noise can be indeed interpreted as white ( i.e. with stationary , independent increments ) , the assumption about its gaussianity can be easily violated .",
    "the examples range from the description of the dynamics in plasmas @xcite , diffusion in energy space , self - diffusion in micelle systems , exciton and charge transport in polymers under conformational motion and incoherent atomic radiation trapping  to the spectral analysis of paleoclimatic @xcite or economic data @xcite , motion in optimal search strategies among randomly distributed target sites @xcite , fluorophore diffusion as studied in photo - bleaching experiments , interstellar scintillations @xcite , ratcheting devices @xcite and many others @xcite .",
    "the present work overviews properties of lvy flights in external potentials with a focus on astonishing aspects of noise - induced phenomena @xcite like resonant activation ( ra ) , stochastic resonance ( sr ) and dynamic hysteresis @xcite . in particular , the persistency of the sr occurrence is examined within a continuous and a two - state description of the generic system @xcite composed of a test particle moving in the double well - potential and subject to the action of deterministic , periodic perturbations and @xmath0-stable lvy type noises . in the same system the appearance of dynamic hysteresis is documented .",
    "moreover , an archetypal escape problem over a fluctuating barrier is analyzed revealing the ra phenomenon in the presence of non - equilibrium lvy type bath .",
    "the model system is described by the following ( overdamped ) langevin equation driven by a lvy stable , white noise @xmath3 @xmath5    to examine occurrence of stochastic resonance and dynamic hysteresis , the generic double - well potential with the periodic perturbation ( see left panel of  fig .",

    "the detection of ra has been carried for a relatively `` high '' barrier @xmath12 , which under the normal diffusion condition guarantees the proper separation of time scales ( the actual times of escape events and time of diffusive motion within the potential well @xcite ) of the process .",
    "following former studies on ra @xcite , the lower barrier height has been chosen to take one of two values @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "a particle has been assumed to start its motion at the reflecting boundary @xmath15 and continued as long as the position fulfilled @xmath16 .",
    "it should be stressed that with generally non - gaussian white noise the knowledge of the boundary location alone can not specify in full the corresponding boundary conditions for reflection or absorption , respectively @xcite .",
    "the trajectories driven by non - gaussian white noise display irregular , discontinuous jumps . as a consequence , the location of the boundary itself is not hit by the majority of discontinuous trajectories .",
    "this implies that regimes beyond the location of the boundaries must be properly accounted for when setting up the boundary conditions .",
    "in particular , multiple recrossings of the boundary location from excursions beyond the specified state space have to be excluded .",
    "as it has been demonstrated elsewhere @xcite , incorporation of lvy flights into kinetic description requires use of nonlocal boundary conditions which , for the case of absorbing boundary at , say , @xmath17 calls for extension of the absorbing regime to the semiline beyond that point , @xmath18 .    the barrier fluctuations causing alternating switching between the high ( @xmath19 ) and low ( @xmath20 ) barrier configurations have been approximated by the markovian dichotomous noise @xcite with the exponential autocorrelation function @xmath21 [ \\eta(t')-\\langle \\eta(t')\\rangle ] \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4}(h_+-h_-)^2\\exp(-2\\gamma |t - t'|)$ ] .",

    "the asymmetry of the occupation probability in either one of the states is reflected in the shape of the dynamic hysteresis loop , which with an increasing @xmath57 becomes distorted into the direction determined by the sign of the skewness parameter .",

    "[ fig : sh_alpha ] .    in order to quantify the sr phenomenon @xcite we have used the standard measures of the signal - to - noise ratio snr and the spectral power amplification @xmath59 @xcite .",

    "namely , for low values of the switching rate @xmath22 , mfpt is an average value of mfpts over both configuration of the barrier . with increasing frequency @xmath22 the distinguishable time scales coalesce and disappear",
