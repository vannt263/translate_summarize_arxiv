    "as the concept of dynamic ensemble distribution remains elusive , a way forward to the study of nonequilibrium systems relies partly on prototypical stochastic models [ ] .",
    "the identification of scaling regimes for these latter at both large time and length scales has permitted to characterize a vast amount of nonequilibrium processes in terms of universality classes [ ] .",
    "however , their asymptotic dynamics can change completely in the presence of quenched disorder or under space - dependent external forces [ ] . this is because particle motion may well remain localized around strong spatial heterogeneities which prevail over stochastic fluctuations [ ] .    in this context , as well as for their value in modelling real non - equilibrium behaviour ,",
    "reaction - diffusion models have been much studied in recent years , with such methods as real space renormalization , yielding very detailed analytical results at large times [ ] . in the thermodynamic limit , some universal and non - universal types of behavior have been reported for these systems [ ] and related models [ ] , yet comparatively little is known on their relaxation times in finite disordered samples . in this work we focus on the dynamic exponents associated to these time scales as well as on finite size scaling aspects which ultimately will turn out to be nonuniversal .",
    "although these processes are here schematized as one dimensional annihilating random walks in a brownian potential [ ] , we expect them to be relevant in the description of such real cases as exciton dynamics on long disordered polymers , given the experimental success of their homogeneous counterparts [ ] .",
    "typically , the microscopic dynamical rules of these models involve hard - core particles which hop randomly and annihilate in pairs on adjacent locations . to determine the effect of quenched disorder on dynamic exponents , here we allow for both varying diffusion and reaction rates in a linear chain .",
    "so we consider the following one - step processes .",
    "a particle at site @xmath0 @xmath1 , chosen from @xmath2 locations , hops with rate @xmath3 @xmath4 to site @xmath5 @xmath6 provided it is vacant .",
    "independently , reacting attempts take place with rate @xmath7 whenever two particles occupy sites @xmath8 and @xmath9 . as we shall see in secs .",
    "iii and iv , the nonuniversal situation alluded to above will be associated to random orientation changes in diffusion biases @xmath10 .",
    "this scenario is illustrated in fig.[snap ] , where an evolution snapshot of these stochastic rules is depicted for the case of instantaneous reactions under a binary distribution of biases .",

    "these are : the nonequilibrium character of the process , formalisable in terms of a non - hermitian quantum hamiltonian [ ] ; criticality - associated with large ( domain ) scales , and small energies ; disorder - the distributions are the source of the remarkable non universality ; particle nonconservation - bringing new features to the non - universal critical phenomena through the interplay between particle and hole sectors .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present a calculation approach that exploits the quantum analogy and focuses on the spectrum _ gap _",
    "( real part ) of the associated non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "for numerical convenience the difficulties brought in by the particle nonconservation are remedied by duplicating the degrees of freedom of the original process . sec .",
    "iii outlines an analytic treatment ( cf . [ ] ) , developed from equations of motion mappings combined with renormalisation and transfer matrix techniques generalised to the non - conserving non - equilibrium nature of the system . among the main features and procedures ( briefly presented below ) are : states appearing at quantised values of a complex phase obtained from phase steps for each bond and sign alternations at limiting phases ; identification and aggregation of phase steps , as generalised random walks , in general biased , in the region between the limiting phases ; this makes the determination of phases and their distributions a first passage problem [ ] in which both the character ( power law or stretched exponential ) of the non - universal critical dynamics and in particular the critical exponents are determined by the effective diffusion constant and bias , inheriting their parameter - dependences ( non - universality ) .",
    "iv implements numerically the ideas developed in sec .",
    "ii to check out the theoretical results obtained in sec .",
    "the computation of finite size scaling properties of the gap yield the dynamic exponents @xmath14 , thus providing the fundamental scaling between length and time .",
    "in addition , numerical simulations are carried out to corroborate the nonuniversal findings for @xmath14 .",
    "v contains a summarizing discussion along with some remarks on extensions of this work .",
    "the common starting point for both theoretical and numerical approaches ( secs .",
    "iii and iv respectively ) , is the representation of the evolution operator of the stochastic process , described above , as a quantum spin-@xmath15 non hermitian hamiltonian [ ] , which henceforth we recast as a problem of spinless fermions via a jordan - wigner transformation ( jw ) [ ] .",
    "furthermore , these particles become actually _ free _ so long as the constraint @xmath16 is imposed for all lattice bonds [ ] .",
    "specifically , it can be readily checked that in terms of fermion operators @xmath17 , the evolution operator under these conditions reads @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) . according to the parity @xmath20 of the subspace considered , here",
    "@xmath21 is a boundary term stemming from the jw transformation under periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "the bilinear form imposed throughout by free fermion constraints is already very suitable for theoretical analysis ( as given in sec .",
    "iii ) , however the pairing terms of @xmath22 would pose severe size restrictions in its numerical analysis , demanding the consideration of matrices growing exponentially with the length of the system . in this",
    "respect , notice that a standard bogoliubov transformation [ ] is not effective within our disordered non hermitian context .",
    "rather , here we follow the strategy of ref . [ ] in formally related systems and proceed to double the degrees of freedom of the original problem by introducing a replica @xmath23 of the hamiltonian @xmath22 . the idea is to find a simple ( i.e. disorder independent ) unitary transformation so as to cancel out all non - conserving particle terms of the replicated system @xmath24 . to this end",
    ", we put forward the following fermion operators @xmath25 with @xmath26 s and @xmath27 s coefficients such that all pairing terms are ultimately canceled in the @xmath28 representation .",
    "in fact , this can be thought of as a local bogoliubov transformation in the real space of the double system . after some simple but lengthy algebra",

    "the @xmath40-momenta must be those of the set @xmath41 for the even subspace , while for the odd one the @xmath40 s should belong to @xmath42 , say for @xmath2 even .",
    "after straightforward algebraic steps , it is readily found that the ordered hamiltonian @xmath43 [ i.e. @xmath44 and @xmath45 in eq.([doubleh ] ) ] reduces to @xmath46\\ , \\left(\\begin{array}{c } f_q \\\\ \\\\",

    "hence , in general the doubling transformation ( [ doubling ] ) should not be regarded as a similarity one , although it preserves all the anticommutation relations which is enough to maintain the spacing of eigenlevels , and in particular the spectrum gap . in the homogeneous case ,",
    "this scales as @xmath53 , so the usual dynamic exponent @xmath54 is restituted .    for the more interesting disordered situation , if we think of @xmath55 as the @xmath56 single particle states of the replicated hamiltonian @xmath57 , then the single excitations of eq.([doubleh ] )",

    "we will recapitulate these ideas in the numerical diagonalizations of sec .",
    "iv so as to account for the theoretical findings of the next section .",
    "in what follows we reconsider the non - conserving fermion hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , but without fermion doubling .",
    "one of the eigenvalue equations associated to that operator involves only `` hole '' state amplitudes @xmath69 at each site @xmath8 .",
    "these provide an inhomogeneous term in the other equation , for the `` particle '' states @xmath70 . using two - component vectors ,",
    "the eigenvalue equation involves @xmath47 matrix coefficients which depend on the excitation `` energy '' @xmath71 , and on bond - dependent biased hopping and bond - independent pair annihilation rates @xmath72 , constrained as in eq.([constraint ] ) , to keep the free - fermion character .",
    "the product of the associated @xmath73 transfer matrices , @xmath74 , provides the spectrum through its trace , or appropriate matrix elements ( depending on boundary conditions ) , effectively corresponding to quantisation of an aggregated phase .",
    "one @xmath47 part of @xmath75 is the transfer matrix @xmath76 for the self - contained subspace ( `` hole sector '' ) provided by the states @xmath69 .    from the coupled eigenvalue equations",
    "one may equivalently proceed via the corresponding @xmath73 transfer matrix @xmath77 , or via renormalisation using a decimation method , or by mapping ratios of successive amplitudes . here",
    "we mainly employ the last approach .",
    "the transfer matrix and decimation approaches are very instructive , in clarifying respectively the role of accumulating complex phases ( which provide the spectrum ) and the renormalization of quenched probability distributions of such aggregated variables , but in what follows it is sufficient and convenient to begin with the transfer matrix and then move over to the mapping approach .",
    "for orientation and to obtain certain characteristic parameters it is useful to separate the rates ( and consequently the transfer matrix itself ) into reference uniform , @xmath8-independent , `` effective medium '' parts ( @xmath78 , indicated by the absence of a site label ) , together with the further random part involving a disorder strength @xmath79 , and ( binary ) random variables @xmath80 at each bond",
    ". then @xmath77 becomes @xmath81 . for any finite size @xmath2 ,",
    "it is possible to start from @xmath82 and build in the disorder terms @xmath83 completely .",
    "for that , it is convenient to work in the representation diagonalising @xmath82 .",
    "two ( @xmath84 say ) of the four labels on its eigenvalues @xmath85 relate to the `` hole '' sector part @xmath76 of the transfer matrix .",
    "the `` particle '' sector ( @xmath86 ) couples to the other sector through the inhomogeneous term referred to above .",
    "the eigenvalues are conveniently parametrised as @xmath87 , where @xmath40 satisfies @xmath88 , with a similar form ( with @xmath71 changed sign ) for @xmath89 .",
    "the formal expansion in powers of @xmath83 gives @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 come respectively from the @xmath84 , and @xmath86 terms in the trace , and each involves sums over @xmath93 disorder variables .",
    "for example , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is a periodic function involving separations @xmath96 of the participating disorder sites and connected with competing aspects of the wavelength and scales set by the local disorder and bias .",
    "@xmath92 involves a part similar to @xmath91 and a second more complex part generated by the inhomogeneous terms .",
    "it is instructive to consider the approximation to the multiple sum in eq.([multiple ] ) coming from taking all @xmath96 as large . in this case",
    "the @xmath40-dependence in the functions @xmath97 goes into an overall exponential factor , and the product of these factors comes out of the multiple sum as a complex phase factor @xmath98 also accompanied by further @xmath40-independent factors .",
    "the summand is then just the product of disorder variables @xmath99 and the sum can be shown to be the coefficient of @xmath100 in the generating function @xmath101 . taken together with the other factors that leads to @xmath102 being the exponential of an aggregated complex phase with real and imaginary parts @xmath103 and @xmath104 , where @xmath105    for binary random rates the sum of @xmath106 is like a random walk .",
    "the case of most interest is when the two possibilities have different signs ( orientations ) for the bias @xmath107 , so steps occur in both directions .",
    "the same phase step ( though aggregated in various different ways ) occurs in the parts of the corresponding approximation for @xmath108 coming from the inhomogeneous terms ; the remaining `` homogeneous part '' has negligible phase step .",
    "however , in the approximation the location of states then becomes the same as for the pure system - coming just from @xmath109 since the disorder dependence of the phase is now confined to the real function @xmath110 .",
    "so it will be necessary to generalise the result obtained by taking characteristic @xmath111 s as large , by retaining the registration between local disorder and aggregating phase which is provided by the functions @xmath97 .",
    "this is most easily done by working with the fully - disordered transfer matrix ( or directly from the original equations of motion ) .",
    "that gives , as follows , information on characteristic scales , domain structures , phase accumulations , and the region of validity of the approximation just discussed .",
    "for the phases from @xmath112 ( the simplest illustration ) only the @xmath47 subpart @xmath76 corresponding to the hole sector of the ( fully - disordered ) transfer matrix @xmath77 is needed .",
    "the crucial aggregating phase variable is @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the ratio of complex amplitudes @xmath69 on successive sites .",
    "these @xmath115 ratios satisfy @xmath116 from this it follows that @xmath117 , where @xmath38 is such that @xmath118 satisfies @xmath119/[\\lambda z_l + h'_{l-1}]\\,.\\ ] ] from this ( mobius ) map , and its first iteration yielding @xmath120 , it can readily be seen that when @xmath121 \\ll \\vert z_l \\vert \\ll \\frac{h'_{l-1 } } { \\lambda } \\equiv z^>_l\\,,\\ ] ] ( needing @xmath71 small ) the variable @xmath122 `` walks '' according to @xmath123 while the complex phase step in @xmath69 is @xmath124   \\sim \\ln\\ , ( h'_{l-1}/h_{l-1 } ) = \\phi_{l-1}$ ] , as was found in eq.([phase ] ) using the approximation on @xmath102 . near @xmath125 ( or @xmath126 ) , the mapped @xmath14 goes to @xmath127 ( or 0 , then 1 , giving a vanishing amplitude ) and changes sign .",
    "this procedure thus provides the region ( [ region ] ) of validity of the approximation on @xmath112 , and generalises it : the behaviour at @xmath128 is the proper consequence of the functions @xmath97 , replacing the sign changes given by @xmath98 in the approximate result .    in the corresponding discussion for the structure and phases in @xmath108 ( coming from `` particle '' states , with complex amplitudes @xmath129 )",
    ", linearity allows a separation into two parts : ( i ) without , and ( ii ) with , the mixing to the states in the `` hole '' subspace just treated .",
    "the discussion for the first part ( ( i ) ) is similar to that just given , and leads to a walk step @xmath130 with @xmath131 close to 1 if @xmath132 satisfies a condition like ( [ region ] ) , with the same limits @xmath133 to leading order in @xmath71 . for small @xmath71",
    ", @xmath134 walks with the same step as @xmath135 , and has the same behaviour at the limiting values . for part ( ii ) , the inhomogeneous term coming from the mixing to the states in the other subspace leads to the occurrence again of @xmath136 and @xmath137 , in terms of which , for @xmath138 ( so @xmath71 is small and @xmath139 ) , the amplitude ratio is @xmath140 where @xmath141 with @xmath142 , and @xmath143 .",
    "the combination of these results from ( i),(ii ) gives the essence of the complicated result for the approximated @xmath108 , together with its validity criterion , and again generalises it as necessary to obtain and quantize the imaginary part of the phase , to enumerate the states : the limiting boundary phase conditions provide the sign reversals in amplitude and correspond to ( reflecting and absorbing ) boundary conditions on the walks described above .",
    "since the walk steps of @xmath144 and @xmath145 contain disorder we need the probability distributions @xmath146 and @xmath147 , which are the same for small @xmath71 .",
    "the distributions depend on the boundary conditions , and are most easily treated in a continuum ( diffusion ) picture .",
    "there , @xmath8 plays the role of time , and the accumulating @xmath144 or @xmath145 plays the role of spatial coordinate . from the walk steps described above , within the limits set by eq.([region ] ) , the distributions satisfy a standard biased diffusion equation having diffusion constant @xmath148 and bias @xmath27 given by @xmath149    the boundary conditions take the biased problem to first - passage form [ ] in which many reflections of the walk occur before absorption is reached , with probability exponentially small in the traversal `` length '' .",
    "the boundary conditions set the limits to the excursion ( of the walk ) , making the traversal `` length '' @xmath150 ( long , as required for the continuum picture , in the critical regime of small @xmath71 ) .",
    "consequently , the first passage `` time '' scale @xmath151 , is proportional to @xmath152 $ ] , which can be written in the scaling form @xmath153 with dynamic exponent @xmath154 in the opposite case of large bias , applying for nearly homogeneous systems , the effects of @xmath155 dominate making @xmath14 close to 2 .",
    "from the exponential distribution @xmath156 $ ] for @xmath157 ( and similarly @xmath158 ) , the energy distribution is appreciable only at @xmath159 .",

    "then a stretched exponential scaling form emerges as follows . for the unbiased case",
    "the first passage problem has standard @xmath162 relation between the `` length '' and `` time '' scales .",

    "to check out the above expectations , we now investigate numerically the finite size behavior of the gap of the original evolution operator ( [ hamiltonian ] ) when averaged over independent disorder realizations . to this end , we diagonalize the @xmath60 matrices referred to in eq.([matrices ] ) given in sec .",

    "<S> we investigate finite size scaling aspects of disorder reaction - diffusion processes in one dimension utilizing both numerical and analytical approaches . the former averages the spectrum gap of the associated evolution operators by doubling their degrees of freedom , while the latter uses various techniques to map the equations of motion to a first passage time process . </S>",
