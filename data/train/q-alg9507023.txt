    "integrals over spaces of connections play an important role in modern gauge theory , but as these spaces are infinite - dimensional , it is often difficult to make heuristic computations involving such integrals rigorous .",
    "suppose one has a smooth principal @xmath0-bundle @xmath8 , and let @xmath2 be the space of smooth connections on @xmath5 .",
    "then @xmath2 is an affine space , and becomes a vector space after an arbitrary choice of some point as origin , so initially it may be tempting to integrate functions using some sort of ` lebesgue measure ' on @xmath2 .",
    "unfortunately , various theorems @xcite indicate that there are no well - behaved translation - invariant measures on an infinite - dimensional vector space .",
    "one might then restrict ones ambition to integrating ` cylinder functions ' and certain limits thereof .",
    "a cylinder function on @xmath2 is one that depends on finitely many coordinates , that is , one of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 are continuous linear functionals and @xmath11 is bounded and continuous .",
    "to integrate these all one needs is a ` cylinder measure ' ; the theory of these is well - developed and widely used in probability theory , quantum mechanics and quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "however , in gauge theory the fact that @xmath2 is an affine space is in many ways less important than the fact that the group @xmath7 of gauge transformations acts on it .",
    "for example , one is often interested in integrating gauge - invariant functions on @xmath2 .",
    "this amounts to doing integrals on @xmath12 , an infinite - dimensional space which is not an affine space , nor even a manifold , but a kind of stratified space . in applications to physics",
    "@xcite one is often interested in integrating ` wilson loops ' , gauge - invariant functions of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a smooth loop in @xmath5 , @xmath15 denotes the holonomy of @xmath4 around @xmath14 , and the trace is taken in some finite - dimensional representation of @xmath0 .",
    "wilson loops are typically not easy to approximate by cylinder functions unless @xmath0 is abelian , so it is difficult to integrate them against cylinder measures .    motivated by rovelli and smolin s work @xcite on the loop representation of quantum gravity , ashtekar and isham @xcite introduced a nonlinear version of the cylinder measure idea which is specially adapted to gauge theory . taking advantage of subsequent reworkings , we may describe their idea as follows .",

    "taking the completion of this algebra in the @xmath20 norm @xmath21 one obtains a c*-algebra of bounded continuous functions on @xmath2 .",

    "elements of @xmath24 are called ` generalized connections ' , and the holonomy of one of these generalized connections along a piecewise smooth path is still well - defined . by the riesz - markov theorem ,",
    "generalized measures on @xmath2 can be identified with finite regular borel measures on @xmath24 .",
    "one might hope for some generalized measure on @xmath2 to serve as a substitute for the nonexistent ` lebesgue measure ' on @xmath2 . at the bare minimum",
    "one would like this generalized measure to be invariant under all automorphisms of the bundle @xmath3  e.g. , gauge transformations and lifts of diffeomorphisms of @xmath5 . in a search for something along these lines , ashtekar and lewandowski",
    "@xcite discovered that the study of generalized measures becomes more manageable when one works with cylinder functions defined using piecewise analytic paths .",
    "technically , the difficulty with piecewise smooth paths is that they can intersect in very complicated ways  even in a cantor set .",
    "piecewise analytic paths , on the other hand , can only intersect in an infinite set if they overlap for some closed interval .",
    "this turns out to greatly simplify matters .",
    "after further work by ashtekar , lewandowski and baez @xcite , the theory of generalized measures in the analytic context now looks as follows .",
    "one assumes @xmath5 is a real - analytic manifold , @xmath0 is a compact connected lie group , and @xmath8 is a smooth principal @xmath0-bundle .",
    "one works only with cylinder functions for which the paths @xmath17 are piecewise real - analytic . letting @xmath25 denote the completion of this space of cylinder functions in the @xmath20 norm , one then defines a ` generalized measure ' to be a bounded linear functional on @xmath25 .",
    "the results of ashtekar and isham still hold : @xmath25 is isomorphic to the c*-algebra of continuous functions on a space @xmath24 containing @xmath2 as a dense subset , and generalized measures on @xmath2 are the same as finite regular borel measures on @xmath24 . in the analytic context , however , it is not too hard to construct a canonical generalized measure on @xmath2 , the ` uniform ' generalized measure .",
    "this generalized measure is invariant under all automorphisms of the bundle @xmath3 that act on the base manifold @xmath5 as real - analytic diffeomorphisms .",
    "the uniform generalized measure is not the only one invariant under all these automorphisms .",
    "in fact , many such generalized measures exist , and they can be constructed and  in a rather abstract sense  classified using the notion of an ` embedded graph ' .",
    "an embedded graph @xmath26 is a finite set of analytic paths @xmath27 \\to m$ ] that are 1 - 1 , embeddings when restricted to @xmath28 , and nonintersecting except possibly at their endpoints .",
    "these paths are called the ` edges ' of the graph .",
    "one can reduce the study of holonomies along any finite set of real - analytic paths to the case of a graph , because given any such set of paths , one can write them as finite products of the edges of some graph ( and their inverses ) .",
    "given an embedded graph @xmath26 with @xmath29 edges , and trivializing @xmath3 over the endpoints of all the edges , a generalized measure @xmath22 on @xmath2 determines a measure @xmath30 on @xmath31 by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is related to @xmath34 by equation ( [ cyl ] ) .",
    "the measures @xmath30 for all embedded graphs @xmath26 determine the generalized measure @xmath22 , and the uniform generalized measure on @xmath2 is the unique one for which all the measures @xmath30 are normalized haar measure on some product of copies of @xmath0 .",
    "it is natural to wonder whether these results depend crucially on the use of analytic paths .",
    "this is not a question of merely technical interest .",
    "one might argue that the analyticity assumptions are not so bad , since every paracompact smooth manifold admits a real - analytic structure , which is unique up to smooth diffeomorphism @xcite .",
    "however , in applications to topological quantum field theory and the loop representation of quantum gravity , diffeomorphism - invariance plays a key role , and real - analytic diffeomorphisms do behave very differently from smooth ones .",
    "after all , a real - analytic diffeomorphism of a connected manifold is completely determined by its restriction to an arbitrarily small neighborhood . to see how this impinges on questions of real physical interest , it is interesting to read the recent work of ashtekar , lewandowski , marolf , mouro and thiemann on diffeomorphism - invariant gauge theories @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to treat the case where @xmath5 is merely _ smooth_. we work with cylinder functions on @xmath2 for which the paths @xmath17 are ` curves ' , that is , _",
    "piecewise smoothly immersed _ , and we let @xmath35 denote the completion of the space of these cylinder functions in the @xmath20 norm . for us ,",
    "a generalized measure will be a continuous linear functional on @xmath35 . note that if @xmath5 is real - analytic then @xmath36",
    ", so any of our generalized measures restricts to a generalized measure as defined in the real - analytic context .",
    "in particular , we construct a generalized measure that is invariant under all automorphisms of the bundle @xmath3 , and which restricts to the uniform generalized measure when @xmath5 is real - analytic .",
    "we again call this the ` uniform ' generalized measure .",
    "in fact , this uniform generalized measure was already constructed by ashtekar and lewandowski @xcite in the case @xmath37 , using special properties of abelian lie groups . from this point of view , the advance of the present paper consists of being able to handle nonabelian groups .",
    "but our work also establishes a framework for handling other generalized measures in the smooth context .",
    "the main ideas behind this framework are as follows .",
    "in analogy with the analytic case , for every family of curves @xmath38 a generalized measure @xmath22 on @xmath2 determines a measure @xmath30 on @xmath31 by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is related to @xmath34 by equation ( [ cyl ] ) .",
    "the goal is thus to reconstruct a generalized measure @xmath22 starting from such a measure @xmath30 for every family @xmath26 . of course",
    ", some conditions must hold for such a collection of measures @xmath30 to come from a generalized measure on @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , not all @xmath29-tuples of elements of @xmath0 can be simultaneously attained as the holonomies of some fixed connection along the curves in @xmath26 , but only those lying in some subset @xmath39 .",
    "to come from a generalized measure , for each family @xmath26 the measure @xmath30 will need to be supported on this ` attainable subset ' @xmath40 , so we need a good understanding of this subset . in particular , in contrast to the analytic case , we can not reduce the problem to considering nice families such as embedded graphs for which @xmath41 .    the reason why @xmath40 may not be all of @xmath31",
    "is that there may be relations among the holonomies along the curves in the family @xmath26 .",
    "these relations occur when the curves overlap for some open interval , so we need to introduce a notion of a ` type ' of possible overlap .",
    "due to the complicated ways curves can intersect in the smooth context , a given type may occur infinitely often in a family @xmath26 ; for a simple example see figure [ fg : type ] .",
    "@xmath42    the goal of section 2 is to describe the possible holonomies of a family of curves .",
    "this is done first for especially well - behaved families of curves called ` tassels ' .",
    "roughly , a tassel based on a point @xmath43 is a family of curves for which , when it is restricted to any neighborhood of @xmath44 , the same types of overlap still occur . this self - similarity forces @xmath40 to be a subgroup of @xmath31 , in fact a subgroup easily presented in terms of the types of overlap occurring in @xmath26 .",
    "then we introduce the notion of a ` web ' .",
    "this is a family @xmath45 of curves that can be written as a union of tassels @xmath46 , sufficiently separated so that @xmath47 .",
    "we will show that the holonomies along any family can be expressed in terms of the holonomies along some web , thus giving an algebraic description of the possible holonomies .",
    "the proofs of these facts , that is of propositions 1 and 2 , can safely be skipped by a reader looking for an initial overview of the results of this paper .",
    "in fact , if the family one started with consisted of the edges of an embedded graph , the tassels this construction would produce would be the restriction of the edges to each cell in a cell decomposition dual to the graph .",
    "thus each tassel would contain one vertex @xmath44 of the graph , and would in fact be based at @xmath44 .",
    "one should therefore think of a web as a generalization of a finite graph , and a tassel based at @xmath44 as a generalization of a neighborhood of a vertex @xmath44 .",
    "in section 3 we give a criterion for a collection of measures @xmath48 , one for each web @xmath45 , to arise from a generalized measure @xmath22 on @xmath2 .",
    "we also show that @xmath22 is uniquely determined by the measures @xmath48 , so that we have a tool for constructing generalized measures .",
    "in section 4 we apply this tool to construct the uniform generalized measure .    in recent work on the loop representation of quantum gravity , ` spin network states ' play an important role @xcite .",
    "these have already been dealt with rigorously in the analytic context , and in section 5 we describe how they work in the smooth context .",
    "the basic idea is as follows .",
    "using the uniform generalized measure @xmath49 on @xmath2 , one can define a hilbert space @xmath50 by completing @xmath35 in the norm associated to the inner product @xmath51 the group @xmath7 of gauge transformations acts on @xmath2 , and this gives rise to a unitary representation of @xmath7 on @xmath50 .",
    "we define @xmath6 to be the subspace of @xmath7-invariant vectors in @xmath50 . the `",
    "spin network states ' form a very explicit ` local ' orthonormal basis of @xmath6 , which is to say an orthonormal basis of the subspace associated to each web @xmath45 . in the analytic context , they are formed using embedded graphs whose edges are labeled with irreducible unitary representations of @xmath0 , and whose vertices are labeled with intertwining operators from the tensor product of the representations labeling the ` incoming ' edges , to the tensor product of the representations labeling ` outgoing ' edges . in the smooth context",
    "spin networks are formed using webs equipped with similar , but more subtle , representation - theoretic data .",
    "an embedded graph is a special case of a web , and in this case our spin network states reduce to the spin network states as defined in the analytic context .",
    "however , it is not yet clear whether the spin networks can be combined in a simple fashion to give an orthonormal basis of all of @xmath6 simultaneously , as in the analytic case .",
    "fix a connected compact lie group @xmath0 , a smooth ( paracompact ) @xmath52-dimensional manifold @xmath5 , and a smooth principal @xmath0-bundle @xmath53 . by a _ curve _ we mean a piecewise smooth map from a finite closed interval of @xmath54 to @xmath5 that is an immersion on each piece .",
    "two curves are considered _ equivalent _ if one is the composition of the other with a positive diffeomorphism between their domains .",
    "a _ family _ of curves is a finite set of curves with a chosen ordering @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath26 is such a family , let @xmath56 be the union of the ranges of the individual curves .",
    "if @xmath57 \\to m$ ] and @xmath58 \\to m$ ] are two curves such that @xmath59 , we can form the _ product",
    "_ @xmath60 by gluing them together at this common point .",
    "of course this is defined only up to equivalence of curves .",
    "it is exactly like the product in the fundamental groupoid , except that we do not identify homotopic curves .",
    "it is still associative , however , and there is a category whose objects are points in @xmath5 and whose morphisms ( other than identity morphisms ) are equivalence classes of curves .",
    "define the _ inverse _ @xmath61 of a curve @xmath62 to be @xmath62 reparametrized by an order - reversing map , again up to equivalence .",
    "this is not truly an inverse for the product , but merely a contravariant functor .",
    "if every curve in the family @xmath26 is equivalent to a ( finite ) product of curves in the family @xmath63 and their inverses , we say that @xmath26 _ depends _ on @xmath63 .",
    "we say that a collection of families of curves @xmath64 is _ independent _ if when @xmath65 , any curve in the family @xmath66 intersects any curve in the family @xmath67 , if at all , only at their endpoints , and there is a neighborhood of each such intersection point whose intersection with @xmath68 is an embedded interval .",
    "obviously even if two families are not independent , one may not depend on the other .",
    "the above definitions are motivated by considering holonomies of connections along these curves .",
    "the map from curves to holonomies given by such a connection sends product to product and inverse to inverse .",
    "if one family of curves depends on another , one can compute the holonomy of a connection along all the curves in the first from the same information about the second . if two families are independent , knowing the holonomies along one family tells one nothing about the holonomies along the other .",
    "a _ subcurve _ of a curve @xmath62 is a curve equivalent to the restriction of @xmath62 to a subinterval of its domain .",
    "restriction _ of a family @xmath26 to a closed set @xmath69 is the family gotten by restricting each @xmath17 to each interval of @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "a point @xmath71 is a _ regular point _ if it is not the image of an endpoint or nondifferentiable point of @xmath26 , and there is a neighborhood of it whose intersection with @xmath56 is an embedded interval .",
    "a family of curves @xmath26 is _ parametrized consistently _ if each curve is parametrized so that @xmath72 implies @xmath73 .",
    "thus each of the curves is actually an embedding , and each point @xmath44 in the range of the family is associated to a unique value of the parameter , which we call @xmath74 . if a family @xmath75 is parametrized consistently and @xmath44 is a point in @xmath56 , define the _ type _ of a regular point @xmath44 , @xmath76 , to be the lie subgroup of @xmath31 consisting of all @xmath29-tuples @xmath77 such that for some @xmath78 we have @xmath79 if @xmath44 lies on @xmath17 , and @xmath80 otherwise .",
    "this gives a canonical isomorphism between any type and @xmath0 .",
    "a fundamental concept in all that follows is that of a ` tassel ' . a family of curves @xmath81 is a _ tassel based on _",
    "@xmath82 if :    @xmath83 lies in a contractible open subset of @xmath5    @xmath81 can be consistently parametrized in such a way that @xmath84 is the left endpoint of every curve @xmath17    two curves in @xmath81 that intersect at a point other than @xmath44 intersect at a point other than @xmath44 in every neighborhood of @xmath44    any type which occurs at some point in @xmath83 occurs in every neighborhood of @xmath44 .",
    "one may visualize the curves of the tassel as radiating outwards from the base @xmath44 .",

    "since this subset consists of products of types in @xmath81 , it is contained in @xmath189 , so @xmath353 may be viewed as a probability measure @xmath22 on @xmath189 . since in this interpretation @xmath354 , the measure @xmath355 is the convolution of @xmath22 and @xmath356 .",
    "now @xmath348 is a tassel based on @xmath44 , and @xmath357 , because every type occurring in @xmath81 occurs arbitrarily close to @xmath44 , and hence in @xmath348 .",
    "so by ( iii ) @xmath358 .",
    "but it is well known that the convolution of a probability measure on a group with haar measure is again haar measure , so @xmath359 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to finish checking condition ( a ) of theorem [ thm : gen ] , we suppose that @xmath360 is a web depending on the web @xmath361 , and show that @xmath362 .    to see this , note that any @xmath363 can be divided into equivalence classes @xmath364 of curves which are parallel at @xmath137 , and that curves from different equivalence classes do not intersect except at @xmath137 ( this is essentially the argument in point ( iv ) above ) .",
    "thus every type of @xmath363 is a type of some @xmath365 , and commutes with all types of any other @xmath366 .",
    "in particular @xmath367 and @xmath368 .    by ( i - iv )",
    ", it suffices to show that @xmath369 assigns an independent measure to each @xmath370 , and by the above it suffices to show that curves in different @xmath370 s do not depend under @xmath371 on curves in the same @xmath365 .",
    "this is clear , because if they did then @xmath137 would be in the range of both of these @xmath370 s , but no neighborhood of it could be an interval because the curves from the two different tassels would be parallel at @xmath137 .",
    "condition ( b ) of theorem [ thm : gen ] is immediate .",
    "each @xmath285 is a probability measure , so as a linear functional it has norm @xmath203 .",

    "first notice that the group @xmath372 of automorphisms of the bundle @xmath3 acts on the space @xmath2 , and thus acts as automorphisms of the c*-algebra @xmath35 via @xmath373 as a consequence it acts dually on the space @xmath374 of generalized measures on @xmath2 .",
    "we shall show that @xmath49 is invariant under this action .",
    "moreover , since a generalized measure @xmath22 on @xmath2 is equivalent to a measure on @xmath23 , it is natural to speak of @xmath22 being a _ probability measure _",
    "if @xmath375 and for all @xmath376 , @xmath377 implies @xmath378 . borrowing some terminology from c*-algebra theory , we also say that a probability measure @xmath22 is _ faithful _",

    ". for this , in turn , it suffices to check it for a tassel , and haar measure is clearly a faithful probability measure . to see that @xmath49 is invariant , note that every step in its construction was manifestly invariant except the choice of trivialization , and we showed that @xmath49 was independent of that .",
    "since @xmath49 is a faithful probability measure , we may define @xmath50 as the hilbert space completion of the space @xmath35 with the inner product @xmath383 .",
    "equivalently , we could set @xmath384 . since @xmath49 is invariant under @xmath372",
    ", there is a unitary representation of @xmath372 on @xmath50 , and thus a unitary representation of the subgroup @xmath385 consisting of gauge transformations .",
    "we define @xmath6 to be the closed subspace consisting of vectors in @xmath50 invariant under the action of @xmath7 . in this section",
    "we describe an explicit set of functions on @xmath2 spanning the hilbert space @xmath6 ; by analogy with the analytic case @xcite we call these ` spin networks ' .    given any family @xmath26 ,",
    "let @xmath386 be the hilbert space of square - integrable functions on @xmath40 with respect to the measure @xmath387 .",
    "of course , the map @xmath388 from @xmath389 to @xmath253 extends to an isometry of @xmath386 into @xmath50 , and the union of the images of these isometries over all families @xmath26 is dense in @xmath50 . in fact",
    "if @xmath26 depends on @xmath63 then the embedding of @xmath386 in @xmath50 factors through that of @xmath390 , so the union of the images of @xmath391 over all webs @xmath45 is also dense . in keeping with the philosophy of this paper",
    ", one can try to understand @xmath50 by understanding @xmath391 for all webs @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath305 is a web , then @xmath391 is fairly simple to describe .",
    "fixing a trivialization of @xmath3 over the endpoints of the curves , @xmath392 .",
    "note however that this isomorphism changes when we change the trivialization .",
    "understanding how it changes is a part of what we need to describe the gauge invariant subspace .    for each family @xmath26 ,",
    "the group @xmath7 acts on @xmath40 .",
    "the quotient of @xmath7 by the subgroup which acts trivially on @xmath40 is a finite - dimensional lie group @xmath393 , which is actually the product over all endpoints @xmath224 of curves in @xmath26 of the groups @xmath394 of gauge transformations of the fibers @xmath395 .",
    "fixing a trivialization of @xmath395 gives an isomorphism between @xmath394 and @xmath0 , so we can think of @xmath393 as a product of copies of @xmath0 .",
    "the action of @xmath7 on @xmath40 gives a unitary representation on @xmath386 , and when @xmath26 depends on @xmath63 the natural embedding @xmath396 is an intertwining operator . let @xmath397 be the subspace of @xmath393-invariant vectors in @xmath386 .",
    "as before , @xmath397 embeds into @xmath398 if @xmath26 depends on @xmath63 , they both embed into @xmath6 in a consistent fashion , and the image of all such embeddings is dense in @xmath6 as @xmath26 ranges over all families , or all webs .",
    "we will construct an orthonormal basis of @xmath399 for each web @xmath45 .",
    "the resulting set of vectors will thus give a set spanning @xmath6 .    to do this , we need an understanding of the action of @xmath400 on @xmath391 .",
    "we begin by considering the action of @xmath401 on @xmath191 when @xmath81 is a tassel . if @xmath81 is a tassel based at @xmath44 , then @xmath402 is the group @xmath0 , with action inherited from the left action of @xmath189 on @xmath403 by the map @xmath404 .",
    "if @xmath224 is any right endpoint of curves in @xmath81 , then @xmath394 is the group @xmath0 , with action inherited from the right action of @xmath189 on @xmath403 by the map @xmath405 , where @xmath211 equals @xmath300 in every entry corresponding to a curve with endpoint @xmath224 , and equals @xmath203 otherwise ( see the proof of theorem [ thm : uni ] ) .",
    "more precisely , the peter - weyl theorem states that @xmath403 as a left and right @xmath189-module decomposes as @xmath406 where @xmath407 is the set of all isomorphism classes of irreducible unitary representations of @xmath189 , @xmath408 is an element of the isomorphism class @xmath409 as a left representation , and @xmath410 is the dual space of @xmath408 , as a right representation .",
    "if @xmath44 is the base of @xmath81 , and @xmath411 is the subgroup of @xmath189 consisting of all @xmath412 , then the action of @xmath402 on @xmath413 is the left action of @xmath414 . likewise if @xmath415 is the subgroup of @xmath189 consisting of all @xmath416 with @xmath79 if the @xmath92th curve in @xmath81 has @xmath224 as its right endpoint , and @xmath80 otherwise , then the action of @xmath394 is the right action of @xmath417 on @xmath418 .    if @xmath45 is a web , we can write @xmath419 where @xmath420 is shorthand for @xmath421",
    ". the action of the gauge group will be the same , except if a point @xmath224 is the right endpoint of more than one tassel , in which case it is the right endpoint of two tassels , say @xmath148 and @xmath146 . in this case",
    "@xmath422 acts on @xmath423 by the tensor product of the actions on each individually .",
    "invariant vectors under this action come from invariant elements of @xmath424 for some choice of @xmath425 and @xmath426 . since the actions of different groups @xmath394 commute",
    ", we can decompose each @xmath427 into an orthogonal direct sum of tensor products , over every @xmath224 an endpoint for @xmath148 , of irreducible unitary right representations of @xmath394 .    to construct actual @xmath400-invariant elements of @xmath391 , recall that the peter - weyl isomorphism is given by sending the element @xmath428 to the function @xmath429 for @xmath430 , @xmath431 being the usual pairing of a vector space with its dual , but multiplied by the square root of @xmath432 to make the isomorphism unitary .",
    "so choose a representation @xmath433 for @xmath434 , choose an @xmath435-invariant vector @xmath436 in @xmath437 , choose a term in the direct sum decomposition of each @xmath427 , such that the representation assigned to each endpoint @xmath224 which is only an endpoint for @xmath148 is assigned the trivial representation and the representations assigned to a @xmath224 which is an endpoint for @xmath146 and @xmath148 respectively are dual representations .",
    "also choose a vector @xmath438 in the trivial representation chosen for each @xmath224 bounding one tassel , and an invariant element @xmath438 of the representation @xmath439 chosen for each @xmath224 bounding two tassels .",
    "notice that @xmath440 for @xmath441 is an element of @xmath442 , and that @xmath443 , the product being over all endpoints @xmath224 , is after reordering appropriately an element of @xmath444 , and thus they can be paired ( by the rescaled pairing ) to get a number , which we call @xmath445 .",
    "we call such a function a _ spin network_.          choosing @xmath436 from an orthonormal basis of the subspace of @xmath437 of @xmath448-invariant vectors , and choosing fixed unit vectors @xmath449 for each term in the direct sum decomposition of @xmath427 , we get an orthonormal basis for @xmath399 .          they are clearly orthonormal , and they certainly span the space of spin networks .",
    "but by the peter - weyl theorem , every @xmath400-invariant element of @xmath391 is spanned by those of the form @xmath452 , with @xmath436 and @xmath453 invariant elements of @xmath437 and @xmath427 for some @xmath425 .",
    "since such @xmath454 are certainly spanned by all the tensor products @xmath455 used to construct spin - networks , it is clear that the spin networks span @xmath399 .",
