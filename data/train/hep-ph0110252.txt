    "at leading power in the hard scale @xmath1 , the quark content of a nucleon state is completely characterized by three distribution functions ( df ) .",
    "they describe the quark momentum and spin with respect to a preferred longitudinal direction induced by a hard scattering process .",
    "two of them , the momentum distribution @xmath2 and the longitudinal spin distribution @xmath3 , have been reliably extracted from experiments and accurately parametrized .",
    "their knowledge has deeply contributed to the studies of the quark - gluon substructure of the nucleon .",
    "the third one , the transversity distribution @xmath4 , measures the probability difference to find the quark polarization parallel versus antiparallel to the transverse polarization of a nucleon target .",
    "therefore , it correlates quarks with opposite chiralities and is usually referred to as a `` chiral - odd '' function . since hard scattering processes in qcd",
    "preserve chirality at leading twist , the @xmath4 is difficult to measure and is systematically suppressed like @xmath5 , for example , in inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "a chiral - odd partner is needed to filter the transversity out of the cross section .",
    "historically , the so - called double spin asymmetry ( dsa ) in drell - yan processes with two transversely polarized protons ( @xmath6 ) was suggested first  @xcite .",
    "however , the transversity distribution @xmath4 for antiquarks in the proton is presumably small  @xcite .",
    "moreover , an upper limit for the dsa derived in a next - to - leading order analysis by using the soffer bounds on transversity was found to be discouraging low  @xcite .    as for dis , semi - inclusive reactions need to be considered in order to provide the chiral - odd partner to @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , in this case new functions enter the game , the fragmentation functions ( ff ) , which give information on the hadronic structure complementary to the one delivered by the df . at leading twist ,",
    "the ff describe the hadron content of quarks and , more generally , they contain information on the hadronization process leading to the detected hadrons ; as such , they give information also on the quark content of hadrons that are not ( or even do not exist as ) stable targets .",
    "the ff are also universal , but are presently less known than the df because a very high resolution and good particle identification are required in the detection of the final state",
    ".    since pions are the most abundant particles detected in the calorimeter , it would be natural to consider semi - inclusive processes where a single collinear pion is detected together with the final lepton inelastically scattered from a transversely polarized nucleon target .",
    "however , the @xmath4 would appear convoluted with a chiral - odd fragmentation function only at twist three and , therefore , suppressed like @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "it seems more convenient to select the more rare final state where a polarized @xmath7 decays into protons and pions  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the decay products reveals the @xmath7 polarization and a dsa isolates at leading twist a contribution proportional to the product of @xmath4 and a chiral - odd ff , @xmath8 , which describes how a transversely polarized quark @xmath9 fragments into a transversely polarized @xmath10 . but",
    "again , as in the case of the drell - yan dsa , low rates are expected here too because of the few @xmath7 particles produced in a hard reaction . moreover",
    ", the theoretical knowledge of the mechanisms that determine the polarization transfer @xmath11 ( i.e. of @xmath8 ) is not yet firmly established .",
    "for all these reasons , building single spin asymmetries ( ssa ) seems to be a better strategy , i.e.  considering dis or @xmath12 processes where only one particle ( the target ) is transversely polarized , but selecting more complicated final states .",
    "the most famous example is the collins effect : the analyzing power of the transverse polarization of the fragmenting quark is represented by the transverse component of the momentum of the detected hadron with respect to the current jet axis .",
    "the typical reactions would be , therefore , a semi - inclusive dis , @xmath13 , or @xmath14 , where the pion is detected not collinear with the jet axis . at leading twist ,",
    "a specific ssa allows for the deconvolution of @xmath4 from the so - called collins function @xmath15 , the prototype of a new class of ff , the interference ff , which are not only chiral - odd , but also _ naive _ t - odd : in absence of two or more reaction channels with a significant relative phase , they are forbidden by time - reversal invariance  @xcite .    from the experimental point of view , extraction of @xmath4 via the collins effect is quite a demanding task , because it requires the complete determination of the transverse momentum of the detected hadron ( though first observations of a non - zero ssa have been reported  @xcite ) . on the other side , it is not sufficient to limit the theoretical analysis at leading order . because of the explicit dependence on an intrinsic transverse momentum , some soft gluon divergencies ( introduced by loop corrections to the tree level result ) do not cancel and must be summed up in sudakov form factors .",
    "the net result is a dilution of the transverse momentum distribution of the fragmenting quark and a final suppression of the ssa , particularly when in the fragmentation process there is another scale very different from the hard one @xmath1 , as for instance the transverse momentum of the produced hadron in the collins effect .",
    "the same phenomenon happens `` squared '' in @xmath16 processes , that , consequently , do not help in determining the collins function  @xcite .",
    "moreover , modelling this interference ff by definition requires the ability of giving a microscopic description of the relevant phase produced by the quantum interference of different channels leading to the same detected hadron : a very difficult task that implies a description of the structure of the residual jet ( as discussed in  @xcite ) , or the introduction of dressed quark propagators  @xcite which may be effectively modelled , for instance , by pion loop corrections  @xcite .    as a better alternative ,",
    "the ssa with detection of two unpolarized leading hadrons inside the same jet was suggested  @xcite . in a previous work ,",
    "we have discussed the general framework for the interference ff arising in this case  @xcite .",
    "assuming that the residual interactions between each leading hadron and the undetected jet is of higher order than the one between the two hadrons themselves , the main result was that @xmath4 gets factorized at leading twist through a novel interference ff , @xmath17 , that relates the transverse polarization of the fragmenting @xmath9 to the relative motion of the two detected hadrons .",
    "this new analyzing power , @xmath17 , filters out the @xmath4 in a very advantageous way , because collinear factorization holds , which leads to an exact cancellation of all collinear divergences , and makes the evolution equations much simpler . moreover , it is also easier to model the residual interaction between the two hadrons only .    in another previous work ,",
    "we have presented a model calculation for the case of the two hadrons being a @xmath18 and a @xmath19 with invariant mass close to the roper resonance  @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we carry the calculation on to the experimentally more relevant case of @xmath20 production with invariant mass close to the @xmath21 resonance , and we discuss some of the practical details for the extraction of @xmath4 from a spin asymmetry in semi - inclusive lepton - nucleon dis .",
    "this observable should be accessible , for instance , at hermes ( when the transversely polarized target will be operative ) or even better at compass ( because of higher counting rates ) ; it will also be a very interesting quantity for the future options in hadronic physics like elfe , tesla - n and eic .",
    "however , as we like to emphasize , the calculation of the @xmath22 fragmentation is process independent and could be most useful also for the spin physics program at rhic , where the extraction of transversity is planned via a ssa in @xmath12 reactions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : iff ] we briefly recall the kinematics and the properties of the ff arising when a transversely polarized quark fragments into two unpolarized leading hadrons in the same current jet .",
    "then , in sec .  [ subsec : h1fromssa ] we specialize the formulae to the case of semi - inclusive lepton - nucleon dis and detail the strategy for building a ssa that allows for the extraction of @xmath4 at leading twist . in sec .",

    "it is built by taking , for each @xmath55 or @xmath126 , the maximum and the minimum among the six curves displayed in the corresponding upper plot .",
    "the first obvious comment is that even the simple mechanism described in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagspec ] produces a measurable asymmetry . for the hermes experiment",
    "the size of the asymmetry may be at the lower edge of possible measurements , given the observed rather small average multiplicity which does not favor the detection of two pions in the final state .",
    "on the other hand , the planned transversely polarized target clearly will improve the situation of azimuthal spin - asymmetry measurements compared to the present one .",
    "compass or possible future experiments at the elfe , tesla - n , or eic facilities will have less problems because of higher counting rates .",
    "the second important result is that the sensitivity of the ssa to the parameters of the model calculation for the ff and to the different parametrizations for the df is weak enough that the unambigous message of a negative asymmetry emerges through all the range of both @xmath198 and @xmath219 gev @xmath220 gev . in particular",
    ", we do not find any change in sign for @xmath221 , contrary to what is predicted in ref .",
    "in this paper we have discussed a way for addressing the transversity distribution @xmath4 that we consider most advantageous compared to other strategies discussed in the literature . at present , the ssa seem anyway preferable to the dsa . but the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark into two unpolarized leading hadrons in the same current jet looks less complicated than the collins effect , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "collinear factorization implies an exact cancellation of the soft divergencies , avoiding any dilution of the asymmetry because of sudakov form factors , and in principle makes the qcd evolution simpler , though we have not addressed this subject in the present paper .",
    "the new effect , that allows for the extraction of @xmath4 at leading twist through the new interference ff @xmath17 , relates the transverse polarization of the quark to the transverse component of the relative momentum of the hadron pair via a new azimuthal angle .",
    "this is the only key quantity to be determined experimentally , while the collins effect requires the determination of the complete transverse momentum vector of the detected hadron .",
    "we have shown also quantitative results for @xmath17 in the case of @xmath20 detection , and the related ssa for the example of lepton - nucleon scattering , because modelling the interference between different channels leading to the same final state is simpler than describing the collins effect , where a microscopic knowledge of the structure of the residual jet is required .",
    "we have adopted a spectator model approximation for @xmath20 with an invariant mass inside the @xmath21 resonance width , limiting the process to leading - twist mechanisms .",
    "the interference between the decay of the @xmath21 and the direct production of @xmath20 is enough to produce sizeable and measurable asymmetries . despite the theoretical uncertainty due to the arbitrariness in fixing the input parameters of the calculation of ff and in choosing the parametrizations for the df ,",
    "the unambigous result emerges that in the explored ranges in @xmath198 and invariant mass @xmath126 the ssa are always negative and almost flat .",
    "anyway , it should be stressed again that , even if there are good arguments for considering the mechanisms depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagspec ] a good representation of @xmath20 production in the considered energy range , still the calculation has been performed at leading twist and in a valence - quark scenario .",
    "therefore , higher - twist corrections and qcd evolution need to be explored before any realistic comparison with experiments could be attempted .",
