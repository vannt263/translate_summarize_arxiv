    "<S> the initial - state multiple scatterings , however , are absent in deeply inelastic scattering and photoproduction because of no direct interaction between photons and gluons , therefore only the final - state multiple scatterings were discussed in ref.[5 ] .    in order to study the contributions from the initial - state multiple scatterings , </S>",
