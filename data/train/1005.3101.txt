    "the idea of embedding our universe in a higher dimensional space has attracted a considerable interest recently , due to the proposal by randall and sundrum that our four - dimensional ( 4d ) spacetime is a three - brane , embedded in a 5d spacetime ( the bulk )  @xcite .",
    "this proposal is based on early studies on superstring theory and m - theory , which have suggested that our four dimensional world is embedded into a higher dimensional spacetime .",
    "particularly , the 10 dimensional @xmath1 heterotic superstring theory is a low - energy limit of the 11 dimensional supergravity , under the compactification scheme @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "thus , the 10 dimensional spacetime is compactified as @xmath3 , implying that our universe ( a brane ) is embedded into a higher dimensional bulk . in this paradigm ,",
    "the standard model particles are open strings , confined on the braneworld , whilst the gravitons and the closed strings can freely propagate into the bulk @xcite .",
    "the randall - sundrum type ii model has the virtue of providing a new type of compactification of gravity @xcite .",
    "standard 4d gravity can be recovered in the low - energy limit of the model , with a 3-brane of positive tension embedded in 5d anti - de sitter bulk .",
    "the covariant formulation of the braneworld models has been formulated in @xcite , leading to the modification of the standard friedmann equations on the brane .",
    "it turns out that the dynamics of the early universe is altered by the quadratic terms in the energy density and by the contribution of the components of the bulk weyl tensor , which both give a contribution in the energy momentum tensor .",
    "this implies a modification of the basic equations describing the cosmological and astrophysical dynamics , which has been extensively considered recently @xcite .",
    "the recent observations of the cmb anisotropy by wmap @xcite have provided convincing evidence for the inflationary paradigm @xcite , according to which in its very early stages the universe experienced an accelerated ( de sitter ) expansionary phase ( for recent reviews on inflation see @xcite ) .    at the end of inflation ,",
    "the universe is in a cold and low - entropy phase , which is utterly different from the present hot high - entropy universe",
    ". therefore the universe should be reheated , or defrosted , to a high enough temperature , in order to recover the standard hot big bang @xcite .",
    "the reheating process may be envisioned as follows : the energy density in zero - momentum mode of the scalar field decays into normal particles with decay rate @xmath4 .",
    "the decay products then scattered and thermalize to form a plasma @xcite .    apart from the behavior of the inflaton field , the evolutions of dark energy and dark matter in reheating stage were also considered . in @xcite ,",
    "dark energy and dark matter were originated from a scalar field in different stages of the inflation , according to a special form of potential .",
    "meanwhile , the conditions for unifying the description of inflation , dark matter and dark energy were considered in @xcite .",
    "a specific model was later proposed in @xcite , by using a modified quadratic scalar potential .",
    "the candidates of dark matter in @xcite and @xcite were oscillations of a scalar field .",
    "however , it may be possible that dark matter existed on its own without originating from the scalar field .",
    "this may pose less stringent constraint on the scalar field , so that dark matter can be included in inflation paradigm in a easier way . on the other hand",
    ", it was proposed that the decay products of scalar field acquired thermal mass @xcite .",
    "the reheating in the braneworld models has also been considered recently . in the context of the braneworld inflation driven by a bulk scalar field ,",
    "the energy dissipation from the bulk scalar field into the matter on the brane was studied in @xcite .",
    "the obtained results supports the idea that the brane inflation model , caused by a bulk scalar field , may be a viable alternative scenario of the early universe .",
    "the inflation and reheating in a braneworld model derived from type iia string theory was studied in @xcite . in this model",
    "the inflaton can decay into scalar and spinor particles , thus reheating the universe .",
    "a model in which high energy brane corrections allow a single scalar field to describe inflation at early epochs and quintessence at late times was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the reheating mechanism in the model originates from born - infeld matter , whose energy density mimics cosmological constant at very early times and manifests itself as radiation subsequently .",
    "the particle production at the collision of two domain walls in a 5-dimensional minkowski spacetime was studied in @xcite .",
    "this may provide the reheating mechanism of an ekpyrotic ( or cyclic ) brane universe , in which two bps branes collide and evolve into a hot big bang universe .",
    "the reheating temperature @xmath5 in models in which the universe exits reheating at temperatures in the mev regime was studied in @xcite , and a minimum bound on @xmath5 was obtained .",
    "the derived lower bound on the reheating temperature also leads to very stringent bounds on the compactification scale in models with @xmath6 large extra dimensions .",
    "the dark matter problem in the randall - sundrum type ii braneworld scenario was discussed in @xcite , by assuming that the lightest supersymmetric particle is the axino .",
    "the axinos can play the role of cold dark matter in the universe , due to the higher reheating temperatures in the braneworld model , as compared to the conventional four - dimensional cosmology .",
    "the impact of the non - conventional brane cosmology on the relic abundance of non - relativistic stable particles in high and low reheating scenarios was investigated in @xcite . in the case of high reheating temperatures ,",
    "the brane cosmology may enhance the dark matter relic density by many order of magnitudes , and a stringent lower bound on the five dimensional scale may be obtained . in the non - equilibrium case ,",
    "the resulting relic density is very small .",
    "the curvaton dynamics in brane - world cosmologies was studied in @xcite .",
    "brane - worlds with non - constant tension , based on the analogy with fluid membranes , which exhibit a temperature - dependence according to the empirical law established by etvs , were introduced in @xcite .",
    "this new degree of freedom allows for evolving gravitational and cosmological constants , the latter being a natural candidate for dark energy .",
    "the covariant dynamics on a brane with variable tension was studied in its full generality , by considering asymmetrically embedded branes , and allowing for non - standard model fields in the 5-dimensional space - time .",
    "this formalism was applied for a perfect fluid on a friedmann brane , which is embedded in a 5-dimensional charged vaidya - anti de sitter space - time . for cosmological branes",
    "a variable brane tension leads to several important consequences .",
    "a variable brane tension may remove the initial singularity of the universe , since the brane universe was created at a finite temperature @xmath7 and scale factor @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "both the brane tension and the 4-dimensional gravitational coupling constant increase with the scale factor from zero to asymptotic values .",
    "the 4-dimensional cosmological constant is dynamical , evolving with @xmath9 , starting with a huge negative value , passing through zero , and finally reaching a small positive value .",
    "such a scale  factor dependent cosmological constant has the potential to generate additional attraction at small @xmath9 ( as dark matter does ) and late - time repulsion at large @xmath9 ( dark energy ) .",
    "the evolution of the brane tension is compensated by energy interchange between the brane and the fifth dimension , such that the continuity equation holds for the cosmological fluid @xcite .",
    "the resulting cosmology closely mimics the standard model at late times , a decelerated phase being followed by an accelerated expansion .",
    "the energy absorption of the brane drives the 5d space - time towards maximal symmetry , thus becoming anti de sitter .",
    "other physical and cosmological implications of a varying brane tension have been considered in @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to further investigate the cosmological implications of a varying brane tension . as a first step in our study",
    ", we consider a thermodynamic interpretation of the varying brane tension models , by showing that the field equations with variable @xmath0 can be interpreted as describing matter creation in a cosmological framework .",
    "the particle creation rate is determined by the variation rate of the brane tension , as well as by the brane - bulk energy - matter transfer rate .",
    "in particular , by adopting a theoretical model in which the brane tension is a simple function of the scale factor of the universe , we consider the possibility that the early inflationary era in the evolution of the brane universe was driven by a varying brane tension .",
    "a varying brane tension may also be responsible for the generation of the matter after reheating , as well as for the late time acceleration of the universe .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section  [ geo ]",
    "we present the field equations of the brane world models with varying brane tension and we write down the basic equations describing the cosmological dynamics of a flat friedmann - robertson - walker universe .",
