    "in recent years , there has been a lot of interest to study the statistical properties of hot rotating nuclei produced through heavy ion fusion reactions .",
    "high excitation energy favours the nucleus to deexcite through statistical emission of several light particles followed by @xmath8 decay .",
    "the deexcitation process is governed by the available phase spaces , _",
    "i.e. _ , the nuclear level densities of both the parent and daughter nuclei , as a function of excitation energy , angular momentum and deformation .",
    "the evaporated light charged particle spectra in conjunction with the statistical model calculations can be used to extract the statistical properties of the hot , rotating nuclei .",
    "however , recent studies reveal that , at high excitation energy and angular momentum , the energy spectra of evaporated light charged particles , are no longer consistent with the standard statistical model predictions .",
    "a large number of experiments have been performed in last few years to study this anomaly over a wide range of compound nuclear masses ( a@xmath9 ) in the range @xmath360170 , for example @xcite , and in most cases ( with the exception of @xcite ) , it has been found that the statistical model fails to explain the observed light charged particle energy spectra .",
    "choudhury et al @xcite have measured the @xmath0-particle energy spectra in the reaction 214 mev @xmath10s on @xmath11al and observed that the measured spectra deviate considerably from the standard statistical model predictions .",
    "la rana et al @xcite have measured @xmath0-particle spectra in the reaction 190 mev @xmath12ar on @xmath11al and have seen similar discrepancy . the authors argued that in the statistical model calculation , the emission barrier is considered as the fusion barrier of the two partners in the exit channel assuming their spherical configuration .",
    "it may be a good approximation at low excitation energy and angular momentum .",
    "but , when the nucleus is at high excitation energy and rotating with high spin , it is likely to be deformed in shape .",
    "hence , the emission barrier will be lower if one considers that the @xmath0-particles are emitted preferentially along the larger axis .",
    "on the contrary , it has been claimed @xcite that , only deformation , unless it is unrealistically large , can not affect the @xmath0-particle emission barrier much ; however , the anomaly may be well explained by incorporating spin dependent level density in the standard statistical model prescription to modify the yrast line keeping the emission barrier unchanged .",
    "recently , charity et al @xcite have measured light charged particle spectra emitted in the reactions @xmath13ni on @xmath14mo and @xmath15o on @xmath16sm .",
    "they have shown that the measured spectra deviate from the statistical model predictions at incident energies above @xmath35 mev / nucleon , and that different set of parameters are required to reproduce the data for different types of light charged particles , such as , @xmath0 , proton , deuteron and triton . moreover ,",
    "magnitude of the deviation has been found to depend on the excitation energy as well as the entrance channel .",
    "intuitively , the entrance channel dependence may affect the shapes of the light charged particle spectra if the equilibrating system remains deformed over a time scale comparable to the mean lifetime of charged particle emission .",
    "recent measurements of @xmath0-particle energy spectra for the reactions 83 , 97 mev @xmath7c on @xmath17sc @xcite and 110mev @xmath15o on @xmath18fe @xcite have also indicated that the role of entrance channel dynamics should be carefully looked into .",
    "it is thus apparent that there exists some discrepancy between the experimentally measured spectra and the corresponding predictions of standard statistical model , which is prominent for higher spin and for heavier systems ( a@xmath1960 ) .",
    "however , due to lack of experimental data situation is not clear for the lighter systems at relatively lower spin .",
    "this prompted us to explore the scenario for light system , such as , @xmath1p , in the incident energy range below 5 mev / a . in the present work , we have populated the compound nucleus @xmath1p at excitation energy @xmath3 60 mev through different entrance channels , i.e. , 96 mev @xmath6f on @xmath7c and 47 mev @xmath4li on @xmath5 mg and have measured the energy and angular distributions of all light charged particles , ( i.e. , @xmath0 , p , d and t ) . since the two reaction channels populate the same compound system with different angular momentum distributions ( l@xmath20 @xmath3 21 @xmath21 and 16 @xmath21 , respectively ) , it offers an opportunity to study the angular momentum dependence in the evaporative decay cascade .",
    "apart from that , entrance channel configurations may also affect the evaporative decay if the nucleus lives in the dinuclear form for a long time and evaporates during this period .",
    "but our previous studies on the intermediate mass fragment emission did not reflect the existence of any such long - lived dinuclear configuration@xcite of the @xmath1p compound nucleus .",
    "earlier , we have measured also @xmath0-particle spectra in coincidence with the evaporation residues in the 96 mev @xmath6f on @xmath7c reaction @xcite and have observed that the measured spectra deviate from the statistical model predictions both at low as well as at high energy sides . assuming a deformed configuration of the compound nucleus",
    ", the full energy spectra could be explained satisfactorily .",
    "interestingly , it has been observed in earlier works that , different amount of deformations are required to explain different sets of light charged particle data .",
    "it directly points to the inadequacy of the standard statistical model to explain the behaviour of light charged particle emission spectra with increasing spin and excitation energy . in the present work",
    ", we would like to explore systematically the scenario of light charged particle emission further for a lighter system at moderate spin and excitation energy .",
    "the paper has been arranged as follows .",
    "the experimental details alongwith the experimental results are described in sec .",
    "the predictions of the statistical model for @xmath1p nucleus have been discussed in sec .",
    "finally the summary and conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "the experiments were performed at the bhabha atomic research centre - tata institute of fundamental research 14 ud pelletron accelerator laboratory , mumbai , with 96 mev @xmath6f beam on 125@xmath22g/@xmath23 self - supporting @xmath7c target and 47 mev @xmath4li beam on 275 @xmath22g/@xmath23 self - supporting @xmath24 mg target .",
    "the beam current was typically 20 - 80 na .",
    "the light charged particles have been detected in three solid state telescopes .",
    "the telescopes ( t@xmath25 , t@xmath26 , t@xmath27 ) were of two elements , consisting of 100@xmath22 m , 45@xmath22 m , 40@xmath22 m @xmath28e si(sb ) and 5 mm , 5 mm , 2 mm si(li ) e detectors respectively .",
    "typical solid angles were 1.5 msr , same for all the three telescopes .",
    "analog signals from the detectors were processed using the standard electronics before being fed to the computer for on - line data acquisition .",
    "the telescopes were calibrated with the radioactive @xmath29th @xmath0-source .",
    "typical energy resolutions ( fwhm ) obtained were 1.12@xmath30 for t@xmath25 and 1.13@xmath30 for t@xmath26 and t@xmath27 respectively .",
    "the low energy cutoffs thus obtained were typically 3 mev for proton , 5 mev for deuteron , 5 mev for triton and 11 mev for @xmath0 in t@xmath25 .",
    "in t@xmath26 and t@xmath27 cutoffs were 1 mev for proton , 3 mev for deuteron , 3 mev for triton and 7 mev for @xmath0-particles .",
    "inclusive energy distributions for @xmath0-particles , proton , deuteron and triton have been measured in an angular range of 25@xmath31 - 140@xmath31 in case of @xmath4li ( 47 mev ) + @xmath24 mg reaction and in a range of 5@xmath31 - 60@xmath31 in case of @xmath6f ( 96 mev ) + @xmath7c reaction . in the centre of mass ( c. m. ) frame it covers up to @xmath3 140@xmath31 in both the cases .",
    "[ fig1]-[fig2 ] show the measured energy spectra for the light charged particles at different laboratory angles respectively for the two reactions .",
    "the shape of the energy spectra is similar for all the measured angles indicating the fact that the thermal equilibrium has been achieved in both the cases before the particle emission .",
    "the average velocities of the observed light charged particles have been plotted in the parallel ( @xmath32 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath33 ) velocity plane ( figs .",
    "[ fig5]-[fig6 ] ) for the @xmath4li ( 47 mev ) + @xmath5 mg and @xmath6f ( 96 mev ) + @xmath7c reactions .",
    "it has been observed , that for all particles , the average velocities fall on a circle around the compound nucleus velocities ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "it implies that the average velocities ( as well as the average kinetic energies ) of the light charged particles are independent of the centre of mass emission angles in both the reactions .",
    "it means that the energy relaxation is complete and the light charged particles are emitted from a fully equilibrated source moving with the velocity @xmath34 .",
    "the deviations in average velocity of the light charged particles at backward angles ( @xmath35 ) are due to large energy cutoffs in the energy spectra .",

    "the angular momentum dependent deformation parameters ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 as described later ) were set equal to zero . from the figures ,",
    "it is observed that the theoretical predictions match well with the experimental results , indicating that all the light charged particles are evaporated from a nearly spherical @xmath1p compound nucleus .",
    "however , in case of @xmath6f ( 96 mev ) + @xmath7c reaction , the statistical model calculation using the code cascade , with the standard parameter set , fails ( the dashed lines ) to predict the shape of the experimental spectra .",
    "[ fig11 ] - [ fig14 ] show the observed ( filled circles ) and calculated ( solid and dashed lines ) centre of mass energy spectra for the various light charged particles emitted in the @xmath6f ( 96 mev ) + @xmath7c reaction .",
    "the figures indicate deviation of the experimental data from the standard statistical model predictions ( dashed lines ) at low as well as at high energy sides of the spectra .    according to the cascade calculations ,",
    "the lower energy part of the spectra is controlled by the transmission coefficients . for the calculation of transmission coefficients",
    ", we have used the same sets of optical model parameters as in the case of @xmath4li ( 47 mev ) + @xmath5 mg reaction , ( _ i.e. _ , the optical model parameters from @xcite for alpha particles , and from @xcite for proton , deuteron and triton ) .",
    "a deformed configuration of the compound nucleus has been assumed in the calculation .",
    "this is realized by varying only the radius parameter r@xmath39 .",
    "the optimum value of r@xmath39 is found to be @xmath3 1.56 fm which is consistent with our earlier work @xcite .",
    "the increased radius parameter lowers the emission barrier and hence enhances the low energy yield by increasing the transmission coefficients .",
    "the higher energy part of the spectra is controlled by the level density @xmath40 , which for a given angular momentum @xmath41 and excitation energy @xmath42 is defined as @xcite ,    @xmath43^{1/2 } ] \\label{lev}\\ ] ]    where @xmath44 is the level density parameter , which is taken to be @xmath45 for the present calculation , @xmath46 is the thermodynamic temperature , @xmath28 is the pairing correction , and e@xmath47 is the rotational energy which can be written in terms of the effective moment of inertia @xmath48 as    @xmath49    in hot rotating nuclei , formed in heavy ion reactions , the effective moment of inertia may be spin dependent and may be written as ,    @xmath50    where , the rigid body moment of inertia , @xmath51 , is given by ,    @xmath52    here , a is the mass number and r@xmath53 is the radius parameter .",
    "non zero values of the parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 introduce spin dependence in the effective moment of inertia ( eq .",
    "[ jeff ] ) . the relation ( eq .",
    "[ erot ] ) defines a region in the energy , angular momentum plane ( e - j plane ) of allowed levels and a region where no levels occur .",
    "the region is bounded by the yrast line defined by the lowest energy state that occurs for a given angular momentum .",
    "it has been observed in the previous experiments @xcite that the yrast line has to be modified to explain the experimental data .",
    "different attempts have been pursued using different tools to modify the yrast line , such as , radius parameter @xmath54 , deformation parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 and the angular momentum j.    however , we have observed that the variation of a single input parameter , @xmath54 , in the code cascade , is sufficient to take care of the low energy as well as the high energy side of the spectra@xcite .",
    "so , in the present calculation , we varied the parameter @xmath54 only , and kept the spin dependent parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ jeff ] ) equal to zero , to reproduce the experimental spectra .",
    "it is clear from figs .",
    "[ fig11 ] -  [ fig14 ] that the calculated spectra ( solid lines ) agree quite well with the experimental spectra both in the low energy as well as in the high energy regions .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", we also attempted to interpret the data using the other alternative ; _ i.e. _ , by introducing angular momentum dependence in the effective moment of inertia through the angular momentum dependent deformation parameters , i.e. , @xmath37 , @xmath38 of eq .",
    "[ jeff ] . the best fit values",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 obtained from fitting the data were @xmath55 and @xmath56 . a representative theoretical prediction with the above best - fit parameters have been shown in fig .  [ fig16 ] along with the respective experimental data for the @xmath0-particles emitted in @xmath6f ( 96 mev ) + @xmath7c reaction .",
    "it is clearly seen that with the above values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the predicted spectra match well with the experimental ones .",
    "it is further evident ( comapring fig .  [ fig16 ] with fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) that both the prescriptions ( either changing @xmath54 only or varying @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) yield nearly equivalent result , at least for the system considered here .    in order to probe more deeply into the matter , we have estimated an average radius parameter ( for non zero values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) by averaging over the angular momentum distribution ( sharp cut - off triangular distribution has been assumed , upto the critical angular momentum 21@xmath21 ) in the following way .",
    "@xmath57    here , r@xmath39 is taken as 1.29 fm .",
    "j@xmath20 is the critical angular momentum of the system . @xmath37 and",
    "@xmath38 values are as stated above .",
    "the effective radius parameter , r@xmath58 , thus obtained is 1.65 fm which is within 10@xmath30 of the radius parameter we have used in the statistical model calculation to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "therefore , it can be said that the variation of single parameter r@xmath39 to fit the data is nearly equivalent to the spin dependent level density prescription as described above , at least for light compound systems involving lower spins .    for such light compound systems like @xmath1p at low spins ,",
    "the present method has a distinct advantage . here",
    ", both lower and higher energy side of the spectra could be fitted by changing a single parameter r@xmath39 , once for all .",
    "the increase of r@xmath39 causes lowering of the barrier which enhances the transmission coefficient , thereby correcting the lower energy side of the spectra ; at the same time , it also causes a reduction of rotational energy thereby changing the level density in right direction to explain the high energy part of the spectra . on the contrary , in the standard spin dependent level density prescription",
    ", one has to take care of the low energy side of the spectra separately by introducing a reduced barrier .",
    "however it may be noted that , as the spin dependent deformation becomes more significant at higher spins , the present method may not lead to realistic values of r@xmath39 for higher spins ; in such cases one may have to consider the spin dependent deformation only . on the other hand , for lower spin values , ( for example",
    ", the compound nucleus @xmath1p formed in the reaction @xmath4li ( 47 mev ) + @xmath5 mg with l@xmath20 @xmath3 16 @xmath21 ) the change in r@xmath39 may not be quite appreciable .",
    "this intuitively explains why the standard statistical model predictions have been in good agreement with the data in this case .",
    "we have also tried to estimate the effect of entrance channel dynamics on light charged particle emission using the code hicol @xcite .",
    "[ fig15 ] shows the calculated temparature of the fused nuclei as a function of time for various angular momentum values covering the range of interest for the two reactions under study . from fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] , it is observed that for both the cases , thermal equlibration of the system is achieved , on the average , within 8@xmath5910@xmath60 second after the zero time . the zero time is defined as the time when the participating nuclei begin to feel the nuclear forces and deviate from their earlier coulomb trajectories .",
    "it is also observed that the temperature decreases with increasing angular momentum .",
    "decay time has been estimated to be @xmath312@xmath5910@xmath60 second , using the code pace2 , which is comparable to the formation time of the nucleus as obtained from hicol .",
    "this implies that the effect of entrance channel on particle emission should be similar in both the reactions .",
    "however , particle spectra observed in the two reactions are different , implying that the above difference may not be due to the entrance channel dynamics .",
    "we have measured the inclusive light charged particle energy spectra in an angular range of 5@xmath31 - 60@xmath31 and 25@xmath31 - 140@xmath31 respectively in the @xmath6f ( 96 mev ) + @xmath7c and @xmath4li ( 47 mev ) + @xmath24 mg reactions .",
    "it has been observed from the average velocity plots in the @xmath32 vs. @xmath33 plane that the average velocities of all light charged particles in both the reactions stated above fall on the circles centered around their respective compound nuclear velocities , implying that these particles are emitted from equilibrated compound nuclear sources .",
    "the data in the two reactions have been compared with the statistical model calculations using the code cascade .",
    "it has been observed that the light charged particle spectra measured in the @xmath4li ( 47 mev ) + @xmath5 mg reaction can be well explained in the framework of standard statistical model calculation , whereas the light charged particle spectra obtained in the @xmath6f ( 96 mev ) + @xmath7c reaction deviate significantly from the similar calculations .",
    "the formation times as estimated by the semiclassical calculation using the code hicol and the decay times as estimated by pace2 are comparable in both the cases .",
    "therefore , the discrepancy in the light charged particle spectra obtained in the two reactions may not be due to the entrance channel effect as the estimated formation and decay times of the compound nucleus in both the cases are of the same order .",
    "rather , it may be attributed to the difference in the angular momentum distributions of the compound nuclei formed in the two reactions considered here .",
    "a satisfactory description of the measured energy spectra in the case of @xmath6f ( 96 mev ) + @xmath7c has been achieved by invoking a deformed configuration of the compound nucleus through the modification of the radius parameter @xmath54 from 1.29 fm to 1.56 fm in the statistical model calculation .",
    "the data could also be reproduced equally well by incorporating spin dependent level density formalism and the average radius parameter obtained using this prescription is 1.65 fm , which is within 10@xmath30 of the radius parameter we have used to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "however , it may be mentioned here that the present simplified approach may not lead to realistic values of @xmath54 for larger values of compound nucleus spin , which may limit the use of this simple approach for heavier compound systems at higher spins . in conclusion",
    ", the present work demonstrates that a modified radius parameter ( r@xmath39 ) alone may be sufficient to reproduce the deformations for lighter systems ( a @xmath3 30 ) .",
    "however , it will be interesting to explore the validity of this simple approach in explaining the light charged particle data for heavier systems at higher excitations ."
