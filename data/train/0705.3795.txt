    "the accumulating astronomical evidence for the present accelerating expansion of the universe has stimulated many investigations into the nature of the dark energy which might be responsible for this unexpected dynamics ( for a review see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) . besides proposing to add some kinds of exotic ( and purely theoretical ) matter species into the energy budget of the universe",
    ", many investigators have also focused their attentions on modifying general relativity ( gr ) on the largest scales so as to introduce significant modifications at late times .",
    "one example is provided by the family of @xmath6 gravity models , which had also been considered before the discovery of cosmic acceleration ( see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors discuss a specific model where the correction to gr is a polynomial function of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 quadratic curvature invariants ( here , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively the ricci scalar , ricci tensor and riemann tensor ) and showed that there exist late - time accelerating attractors in friedmann cosmological solutions to the theory .",
    "it is very interesting that when the ricci scalar @xmath13 in the einstein - hilbert action is replaced by some general functions of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , it becomes necessary to distinguish between two different variational approaches in deriving the field equations . in the metric approach , as in refs .",
    "@xcite , the metric components @xmath16 are the only variational variables and the field equations are generally of fourth - order , which makes the theories phenomenologically richer but more stringently constrained in many cases . within the palatini variational approach ,",
    "on the other hand , we treat the metric @xmath16 and connection @xmath17 as independent variables and extremize the action with respect to both of them , and the resulting field equations are second order and easier to solve .",
    "the palatini @xmath6 gravity is also proposed as an alternative to dark energy in a series of works @xcite",
    ". there has since been growing interest in these modified gravity theories : for the local tests of the palatini and metric @xmath6 gravity models see @xcite , and for the cosmologies of these two classes of models see @xcite .    both approaches to modifying gravity",
    "are far from problem - free . in the metric @xmath6 gravity models ,",
    "the theory is conformally related to standard gr plus a self - interacting scalar field @xcite , which generally introduces extra forces inconsistent with solar system tests @xcite .",
    "the palatini approach , on the other hand , generally leads to a large ( or even negative ) sound - speed - squared term in the growth equation of the matter perturbations on small scales , and its predicted shapes of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and matter power - spectra deviate unacceptably from those predicted in gr @xcite , and so fail the most fundamental cosmological tests .",
    "again , these examples reiterate the difficulties encountered when trying to make general modified gravity theories compatible with observations .    in this work we will focus on another form of modified gravity , the modified gauss - bonnet theory , which is proposed and discussed in @xcite ( see , for example , noodsa2005 , carneu2006 , koimota2007 for a related model ) . in these models ,",
    "gr is modified by adding an arbitrary function @xmath0 into the gravitational action , where @xmath18 is the gauss - bonnet invariant ( which is a topological invariant in four dimensions ) .",
    "such correction is motivated by the effective low - energy actions in string theory and is shown to be able to pass solar - system tests even though it arises in the _ metric _ variational approach .",
    "furthermore , refs .",
    "@xcite also demonstrate that such models can produce late - time cosmic acceleration , as well as a transition from deceleration to acceleration , or from a non - phantom phase to a phantom phase .",
    "here , we are interested in the perturbation dynamics in such modified gravity theories , and the cosmology arising from them at first - order in perturbation theory .    our presentation is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sect : equations ] , we briefly introduce the model and present the perturbation equations of general @xmath0 model in covariant and gauge invariant ( cgi ) form . for this",
    ", we generalize the effective energy - momentum tensor approach of deriving cgi modified gravitational field equations in a way which could be applied to a general @xmath2 theory  which includes the @xmath19 and @xmath6 models as specific cases . in sec .",
    "[ sect : background ] we shall discuss the background evolution of @xmath0 models and explain why arbitrary cosmic histories can not be realized with the @xmath0 model .",
    "the perturbation equations are then analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sect : perturbation ] , where we also evolve these equations numerically to investigate the @xmath0 effects on the growth of linear perturbations .",
    "our discussion and conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sect : conclusion ] . throughout this work",

    "in this section we briefly introduce the main ingredients of @xmath0 gravity and derive the general perturbation equations that govern the dynamics of small inhomogeneities in the cosmological models that arise in this theory .",
    "our starting point for @xmath0 gravity is the modified einstein - hilbert action , @xmath25,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath26 with @xmath27 being the gravitational constant and @xmath28 is the ricci scalar .",
    "varying this action with respect to the metric @xmath16 gives the modified einstein equations @xmath29where @xmath30 ( notice that , unlike in the @xmath31 models , @xmath32 here is not dimensionless ) and @xmath33 is the energy - momentum tensor of the fluid matter ( photons , baryons , cold dark matter , and light neutrinos ) .",
    "the trace of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) reads @xmath34with @xmath35 .",
    "we see that the curvature - related quantities ( @xmath36 ) are determined by the energy - momentum tensor of the fluid matter through a complicated dynamical equation eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) and thus the modification to the gr field equations can be understood as a change in the way that the spacetime curvature , and thus the ricci tensor @xmath37 , responds to the distribution of matter .",
    "the cgi perturbation equations in general theories of @xmath0 gravity are derived in this section using the method of @xmath38 decomposition ellis1989 , ellis1998 , challinor1999 , lewis2000 .",
    "furthermore , we shall adopt the effective energy - momentum tensor approach @xcite , which treats the modifications on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) as an effective energy - momentum tensor .",
    "however , since the modification generally involves terms nonlinear in @xmath39 , we should express these terms appropriately .",
    "this will be done in more detail below , but now let us briefly review the main ingredients of @xmath38 decomposition and their application to standard general relativity for ease of later reference ( as in gr , there is only fluid matter so we shall neglect the superscript @xmath40 in this subsection ) .",
    "the main idea of @xmath38 decomposition is to make spacetime splits of physical quantities with respect to the 4-velocity @xmath41 of an observer .",
    "the projection tensor @xmath42 is defined as @xmath43 and can be used to obtain covariant tensors perpendicular to @xmath44 .",

    "second , it is not difficult to check that the above quantities satisfy the independent energy - momentum conservation equations @xmath100this is a result of the energy - momentum conservation in fluid matter and the contracted bianchi identity .",
    "thirdly , it would be convenient to use @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( see eq .",

    "for similar reasons eq .",
    "( [ eq:20 ] ) remains a first - order differential equation for @xmath110 for the present model .",
    "these simplifications also occur in the @xmath6 gravity models but not in general @xmath2 theories . in the later case , the method we use here to derive the cgi perturbation equations still applies and the perturbation equations will become even higher order and more complicated ( specifically , some of the perturbation equations above will become propagation equations for @xmath111 and @xmath112 where @xmath113 denotes general modified gravity theory @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we can see that the quantity @xmath32 here appears only to ( at least directly ) influence background evolutions , and with the background fixed it is its derivative which determines the perturbation evolutions .",
    "in this section we discuss the background evolution in general @xmath0 gravity models .",
    "recall that in @xmath6 gravity theories the fourth - order nature of the friedmann equation allows enough freedom for the model to reproduce an arbitrary background cosmic evolution .",
    "since the field equations are also fourth order in the @xmath0 models , one might think that they could also describe arbitrarily parameterized background histories .",
    "however , this is not the case , as we shall see below .",
    "this is because @xmath114 must change its sign in the recent past in many fixed - background models .",
    "for the background evolution , we use the friedmann equation eq .",
    "( [ eq:23 ] ) with the dark energy density given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:33 ] ) @xmath115where we have kept terms only up to zero order and used the expression @xmath116 , which is obtained from eqs .",

    "note that by writing in this way we have chosen to parameterize the background expansion to be the same as the dynamical dark - energy model @xmath126 or the @xmath8 paradigm ( @xmath127 ) .    in the following",
    ", we shall assume @xmath127 for simplicity and the calculations for general @xmath128 could be done similarly . in this case",
    "we have @xmath129where @xmath130 are respectively the fractional densities for non - relativistic and relativistic matter species . deep into the radiation - dominated era we have @xmath131 and thus eq .",
    "( [ eq:40 ] ) reduces to @xmath132whose solution is @xmath133 in this work we shall require @xmath134 so that @xmath135 could be set to zero in eq .",
    "( [ eq:43 ] ) . to obtain the background evolution numerically , we start deep in the radiation - dominated era ( _ e.g. , _ at @xmath136 ) and take the radiation - dominated solution , eq .",
    "( [ eq:43 ] ) , to be the initial condition .",
    "the solutions to eq .",
    "( eq:40 ) are then characterized by a single parameter @xmath137 .",
    "different values of @xmath137 give the same background history , but in general lead to different evolutions for the perturbations , as we shall see below .",
    "note that @xmath138 describes the standard @xmath8 paradigm .",
    "up to this point the procedure is quite similar to that in metric @xmath6 gravity models .",
    "however , as was claimed above , the @xmath0 gravity model can not be used to reproduce arbitrarily parameterized background expansion histories . to explain why",
    ", we shall again take the @xmath8 background as an example and adopt the value @xmath4 , as suggested by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) three - year data @xcite",
    ". then it will be easy to find that @xmath139 changes its sign ( from @xmath140 to @xmath141 ) at @xmath142 , which means that @xmath1 increases ( decreases ) when @xmath143 .",
    "as a result , with the match to @xmath144 at @xmath145 the function @xmath0 with _ all possible values _ of @xmath1 has been determined , and there will generally be no freedom left to fix the evolution to @xmath8 at @xmath146 as well ( of course , if @xmath0 is a real cosmological constant then @xmath3 will also be reproduced at @xmath146 , but in general reproducing @xmath8 on _ both _ sides of @xmath147 is far too strong a requirement to be satisfied ) .",
    "so , what we may conclude is that the @xmath0 model can mimic a @xmath8 universe up to @xmath147 , after which the evolution might be governed by the already - determined @xmath0 .",
    "however , note that @xmath142 corresponds to a critical redshift @xmath148 , so the transition from @xmath8 phase to a non-@xmath8 phase occurs quite late @xcite .     for the @xmath0 gravity models fixed to match a @xmath149 cosmic expansion history ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "the curves from top to bottom are characterized by @xmath151 respectively . notice that with our convention @xmath152 and @xmath153 . ]     for the @xmath0 gravity models fixed to match a @xmath154 cosmic expansion history ( @xmath155 ) which are stable in early time perturbation growths ( @xmath156 ) .",

    "note that a true cosmological constant has @xmath158 . ]    in the above , we have analyzed for a @xmath8 ( @xmath127 ) background .",
    "nonetheless we can expect that similar situations exist for general dynamical ( @xmath159 ) dark - energy backgrounds which are characterized by a late - time transition from @xmath160 to @xmath161 .",
    "the investigation of background evolutions in general modified gauss - bonnet models is an interesting topic which is unfortunately beyond the scope of the present work . here",
    ", we solve the perturbed equations numerically and investigate the effects of the @xmath0 modifications to gr on the growth of linear perturbations .",
    "for simplicity we shall adopt a slightly unrealistic @xmath144 cosmic history which is described by @xmath162 ( in this case the transition from @xmath160 to @xmath163 has not taken place yet ) .    in fig .",

    "( [ eq:47 ] ) never becomes important and @xmath225 is small enough for our choices of @xmath137 , so the deviation from @xmath8 ( @xmath138 ) is small . on small scales , however , the @xmath224 term is significant , and makes @xmath226 blow up quickly .",
    "this is also similar to the @xmath219 branch in ref .",
    "@xcite , and produces a matter power spectrum which is strongly scale dependent for large @xmath216 ( note the difference to metric @xmath6 models @xcite ) .",
    "this scale dependence will be strongly disfavored by current data on galaxy power spectra ( such as those from sloan digital sky survey ) and gives a second stringent constraint on the @xmath0 cosmological models . considering these , although evaluating the numerical constraint on @xmath227 is beyond the scope of the present work , we can claim that the parameter space for a viable @xmath0 cosmology is highly limited .",
    "this , among others , once more reveals the difficulties appearing in explaining the cosmic acceleration with modified gravity models .",
    "one should notice that the instabilities of the matter component found in these @xmath0 , and in @xmath6 models within the palatini approach , are in fact dependent on the nature of the dark matter and not only on the gravity sector @xcite .",
    "for instance , instabilities are also found in gr models where cold dark matter is coupled to a light scalar field amendola .",
    "however , when dark matter is not cold , and so has a free - streaming length , instabilities might go away , as occurs in some interacting hot - dark - matter - dark - energy models @xcite . hence , ruling out these gravity models just due to the instabilities in cdm might not be the last word .",
    "to summarize : in this work we have consider the cosmology arising from a new modified gravity model , the modified gauss - bonnet model , where a function , @xmath228 of the gauss - bonnet invariant is added to the einstein - hilbert gravitational action to account for the current cosmic acceleration , at both the background and first - order perturbation levels .    for the background - level evolution , we find that @xmath0 models can not describe arbitrarily parameterized cosmic histories leading to the current observations , because these histories are generally characterized by a transition from @xmath229 to @xmath230 which might impose too strong a requirement on the form of @xmath5 .    for the linear - level evolution , we present the first - order perturbation equations for the @xmath0 gravity model in the cgi formalism with a derivation which can also be applied to general @xmath231 models .",
    "the special combination of @xmath232 and @xmath10 terms in the invariant @xmath1 ensures that the set of perturbation equations resemble that in the @xmath6 gravity models and is much simpler than those in @xmath233 or @xmath234 theories .",
    "we analyze the perturbation equations and find that only the @xmath7 subclass of the models could have stable perturbation growth .",
    "furthermore , even within this subclass , there will be a period during which the small - scale perturbation growth is no longer stable unless @xmath170 is close enough to zero .",
    "this unstable growing period has two important consequences .",
    "firstly , it makes the gravitational potential @xmath211 change very rapidly , which may greatly enhance the isw effect and alter the cmb power .",
    "secondly , the small - scale dark matter density perturbations grow much more quickly than in the @xmath8 paradigm , which might lead to a strongly scale - dependent matter power spectrum . in both cases ,",
    "the model therefore faces stringent constraints from the cosmological data sets on linear spectra .",
    "we thus conclude that the parameter space for a viable @xmath0 cosmological model is highly constrained .",
    "there are several points which arise from this work but are beyond the scope of the present investigation .",
    "for example , it might be interesting to make an analysis of the evolution dynamics for general @xmath0 models and to include the constraints arising from solar - system tests of gravity on the model .",
