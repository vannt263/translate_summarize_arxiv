    "observations of spectroscopic binary stars provide dynamical measurements of stellar mass and binary mass ratio that are important inputs to theories of binary star formation @xcite . measuring the radial velocity versus orbital phase for a single - lined spectroscopic binary ( sb1 )",
    "yields orbital parameters and the mass function , @xmath3 , in which the mass ratio , @xmath4 , is inseparable from the orbital inclination . for an ensemble of sb1s",
    ", a statistical approach can be used to derive the distribution of mass ratios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if , however , a binary is observed as a double - lined system ( sb2 ) , then the dynamical mass ratio follows directly from the radial velocity measurements @xcite . with an estimate of the primary mass ,",
    "say based on the spectral type , the mass ratio gives the secondary mass , and in the case of an ensemble of sb2s , the secondary mass distribution .    obtaining a purely dynamical mass ratio distribution using sb2s is challenging : a binary with a mass ratio of much less than one has a small flux ratio , @xmath5 , so the secondary component is difficult to detect .",
    "this flux ratio problem is particularly inhibitive at visible wavelengths where much of the long term monitoring of spectroscopic binaries has occurred . for this reason ,",
    "most identified sbs are sb1s , and there is a strong selection effect favoring the detection of sb2s with @xmath6 near 1 .",
    "a binary composed of main sequence stars with unequal masses will have an @xmath7 that increases towards longer wavelengths , making the companion easier to detect using infrared spectroscopy .",
    "such observations have allowed the measurement of sb2s with @xmath6 s as small as @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite examined a sample of 164 nearby sb1s , sb2s , visual binaries , and common proper motion pairs , with f- and g - type primary stars , and found that the mass ratio distribution for medium to long period binaries increases towards small mass ratios .",
    "@xcite used a well defined sample of 129 sb1s and sb2s from the carney - latham sample of high proper motion stars @xcite to derive a bimodal mass ratio distribution with peaks at @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "they found somewhat different distributions for halo versus disk stars , and for binaries with primary masses greater than and less than 0.67@xmath11 . by working in the infrared , @xcite observed 32 binaries from the carney - latham sample as sb2s , with mass ratios as small as @xmath120.20 .",
    "when combined with sb2s from visible light spectroscopy , they found a mass ratio distribution that is approximately flat from @xmath13 .",
    "the samples studied by @xcite , @xcite , and , for @xmath6 s near 1 by @xcite , represent averages of star formation outcomes in the solar neighborhood over billions of years .",
    "most star formation occurs in localized regions within molecular clouds .",
    "studies of the binary population in diverse star forming regions can isolate the physical parameters that determine the properties of the binaries formed .",
    "for example , the competing effects of fragmentation , dynamical interactions , and accretion are not fully understood @xcite .",
    "observations of binaries in open clusters can clarify the important processes because they share a common star formation origin and history .",
    "ideally , such observations would be carried out on young clusters that have an easily identifiable membership and still retain their most massive members .",
    "however , it is difficult to measure the orbital velocities of the youngest stars because they tend to have high rotation velocities .",
    "stars in older open clusters still retain much of their cluster identity yet are rotationally spun down .",
    "the hyades is one such nearby open cluster : it is well studied and presents an excellent laboratory for measuring a well defined sample of binary stars in order to investigate binary star formation .",

    "because the hyades cluster is nearby , it covers a large angular extent on the sky , so determining the cluster membership is difficult .",

    "echelle orders are isolated with an order sorting circular variable filter .",
    "all of the observations used a single grating setting centered at 1.5548@xmath31 because this spectral region contains several deep lines , a requirement for precisely measuring radial velocities .",
    "we used a @xmath32 slit which provided a spectral resolution of @xmath33 .",
    "the spectra we obtained have a free spectral range of @xmath34 .",
    "we observed each binary as a series of short integrations , from 60 to 300s in duration , nodding the telescope @xmath35 along the slit between integrations in an abba pattern . by differencing each set of a and b frames we removed contributions from detector bias , dark current , and sky background .",
    "we took a series of flat and dark frames at the beginning of each observing session , which were median filtered and normalized to provide a flat field correction for each target `` a - b '' image . to measure the dispersion solution , we observed ar and kr arc - lamp spectra from cshell s internal lamps .",
    "we extracted each `` a - b '' image using a custom optimal extraction code written in idl , patterned after the algorithms described by @xcite , and averaged the set of resulting spectra for each target .",
    "we adjusted the total integration time for each target to provide spectra with a signal - to - noise of @xmath36 , although we relaxed this condition for targets with a large @xmath28 , and also for the faintest targets to avoid very long integrations that were an inefficient use of telescope time .",
    "observations in october 2003 suffered from poor weather conditions and did not result in any usable spectra . during the 2005 and 2006 observations the cshell detector experienced brief , uncontrolled temperature warm - ups that increased the thermal background by as much as two orders of magnitude over the nominal few tens of adus , affecting @xmath37 of the integrations .",
    "spectra obtained under these circumstances have decreased s / n , but most are still usable .",
    "the cshell observations from 2004 suggested that high s / n observations of h69 and vb  142 with a larger telescope would be particularly useful .",
    "h69 , with @xmath38 mag , is a faint target for the irtf .",
    "the sb1 solution for vb  142 yields a mass function with a very small @xmath28 of 0.04 , and the 2004 october 1 sb2 measurement indicated that @xmath6 was indeed small and the companion possibly a brown dwarf .",
    "we subsequently observed these binaries on 2005 february 22 at the w. m. keck observatory with nirspec , the facility near - infrared spectrograph @xcite .",
    "we also observed vb  43 , which at that time was nearing a phase with a large velocity separation .",
    "these observations are included in table  [ table : obslog ] .",
    "we used nirspec in its cross - dispersed echelle mode with the 2-pixel slit , which provided a spectral resolution of @xmath39 . each target",
    "was observed as a sequence of abba integrations , using a nod of @xmath35 .",
    "a sequence of flat and dark frames was obtained at the beginning of the night and median filtered .",
    "night sky oh emission lines , identified from the catalog of @xcite , provided a simultaneous wavelength reference to determine the dispersion solution .",
    "we extracted the spectra in idl using redspec , the nirspec facility software package .",
    "in addition to normal image processing , redspec rectifies the images in both the spatial and spectral dimensions to extract each order .",
    "the extracted nod pairs were averaged for each target .",
    "we worked only with nirspec order 49 , centered at @xmath40 and spanning @xmath41 , because it is nearly completely free of telluric absorption ; the other orders provided by our grating setting are contaminated to varying degrees ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  1 ) .",
    "we measure the radial velocities of a binary spectrum with reference to template stellar spectra having spectral type , metallicity , and rotational velocity similar to the binary components .",
    "we have two libraries of observed single star templates .",
    "the first was obtained with nirspec and covers spectral types from g0 through m9 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig 36 ) .",
    "the template velocities are tied to the @xcite reference frame ; this procedure and the individual template velocities are reported in @xcite .",
    "the second library was obtained with cshell and covers spectral types from g0 through m1 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig 2 ) .",
    "this library is considerably more sparse in spectral type compared with the nirspec library and some cshell templates have a low s / n .",
    "both template libraries are comprised of stars with small rotational velocities .",
    "we used a non - linear limb darkening model @xcite to rotationally broaden the templates as needed , following the procedure outlined by @xcite . in the analysis presented here ,",
    "we relied primarily on the nirspec templates because of their high quality , but also utilized the cshell templates where they matched the spectral types of the targets .",
    "we analyzed the infrared spectra with a two - dimensional correlation algorithm similar to the todcor algorithm described by @xcite .",
    "for each infrared observation , we used the sb1 parameters to calculate the orbital phase and the radial velocity of the primary .",
    "we then estimated the range of possible secondary velocities at that phase , corresponding to @xmath6 ranging from @xmath28 to 1 , with some allowance for the uncertainty in the primary mass estimate (  [ sample ] ) .",
    "we analyzed each target with two or three templates that matched the known characteristics of the primary and a range of four to eight plausible secondary templates , while leaving the flux ratio unconstrained .",
    "this resulted in sets of measured velocities and flux ratios for each combination of templates , which we averaged to obtain the final measured velocities reported in table  [ table : obslog ] .",
    "we did not detect the companion for seven of the binaries in our sample , and for three others were successful for only part of our observations .",
    "we indicate these observations in table  [ table : obslog ] as missing data , and address these systems in detail in  [ sb2nondetections ] .",
    "we estimated the uncertainties of both the primary and secondary velocity measurements as a combination of two factors : ( 1 ) the velocity uncertainty of the templates and ( 2 ) the uncertainty in measuring the center of the correlation peak due to noise in the target spectrum .",
    "we took the contribution from the templates simply as the variance of the velocities measured over the set of template pairs .",
    "we measured the contribution from noise in each target spectrum as follows .",
    "first , we created a model binary from a pair of templates used in the target spectrum analysis , with the same velocity separation and flux ratio as measured in the target .",
    "then , we added random noise to the model and analyzed it using the correlation algorithm with the same pair of templates .",
    "we adjusted the amplitude of the noise until the peak correlation from the model equaled the peak correlation measured in the target spectrum .",
    "we then generated 100 copies of this model , each using a unique noise vector at the prescribed amplitude . analyzing these models resulted in distributions of primary and secondary velocities , which we fit as normal distributions .",
    "we repeated this with four different template pairs , and took the average of the distribution widths to be the uncertainty contributed by noise in that target spectrum . by combining this average in quadrature with the uncertainty due to the templates",
    ", we arrived at our best estimate of the uncertainty for an individual velocity measurement .",
    "we used this procedure to empirically determine the uncertainties on both our primary and secondary velocity measurements for each of our observed target spectra .",
    "the relative contribution to the total uncertainties from ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) varied for each target spectrum .",
    "templates with later spectral type have a worse velocity precision that those with an earlier spectral type @xcite .",
    "so , for example , an analysis using m - star templates would have a large portion of the total uncertainty contributed by the templates .",
    "conversely , a target spectrum with low s / n , often the case for the fainter binaries in our sample , would derive most of its total uncertainty from the measurement of the correlation peak .",
    "an additional source of noise that has effected previous correlation analyses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) comes from a mismatch between the target primary and the template primary . if these spectra have different physical properties , particularly the metallicity of various species , then the precision of both the measured velocities and flux ratio is effected .",
    "we examined this on several of our target spectra where the velocity uncertainties obtained using the above procedure seemed inadequate ( see  [ sb2solutions ] ) .",
    "we reanalyzed the model binaries from ( 2 ) using alternate template spectra of similar spectral type , thereby simulating potential mismatch between the templates and the target spectra .",
    "we found that the increase the velocity uncertainty over that obtained in ( 2 ) was negligible .",
    "this is likely due to the small spectral range of our cshell templates , which limits the possibility of metallicity mismatch .",
    "consequently , the velocity uncertainties reported in table  [ table : obslog ] do not include any contribution from this effect .",
    "to verify that our visible and infrared velocity reference frames were in good agreement , we compared the primary velocities measured in the infrared spectra with those predicted from the visible light sb1 solutions .",
    "figure  [ fig : vonediff ] shows the distribution of the difference between the predicted velocities and the measured velocities .",
    "the distribution has a mean of @xmath42 and is fit by a gaussian with a width of @xmath43 .",
    "this difference is smaller than our infrared velocity precision @xcite and demonstrates that the two reference frames are indeed consistent to within the measurement uncertainties .",
    "the samples in figure  [ fig : vonediff ] with a velocity difference larger than @xmath44 are attributable to infrared spectra with a low s / n .      the targets vb  8 , vb  30 , vb  68 , vb  77 , and bd+02  1102 have f - type primary stars that are rapidly rotating , with @xmath45 from @xmath46 , and so the spectral lines of these stars are strongly rotationally broadened .",
    "the limited spectral range of the cshell spectra did not contain enough strong features to measure the primary velocities in the infrared spectra of these binaries .",
    "we considered , however , that lower mass companions will have spun down and might therefore be sensitive to a correlation analysis . to examine this we modified our correlation analysis to use an artificial primary template comprised of a featureless , flat spectrum .",
    "we analyzed each target spectrum with a range of plausible secondary templates , allowing the flux ratio to vary , to measure the secondary velocity .",
    "this procedure was successful for vb  68 , vb  77 , and bd+02  1102 , and the velocities we measured for these systems are included in table  [ table : obslog ] , along with a note indicating the altered analysis .",
    "the associated uncertainties were modeled using the procedure described in  [ irccorr ] and the artificial primary template described above .",
    "we did not detect the secondaries for vb  8 or vb  30 ; we discuss both systems in  [ sb2nondetections ] .",
    "four binaries in our infrared sample , l20 , vb  102 , vb  151 , and vb  40 , are the inner pair of hierarchical triple systems .",
    "speckle imaging from @xcite identified the wide companions in these systems with orbital periods from a few tens to a few hundreds of years , assuming circular orbits .",
    "we briefly describe how the presence of a third spectrum in our observations affected the analysis .",
    "the wide companion to l20 has similar brightness to the primary of the inner binary .",
    "its spectrum is clearly apparent in our infrared observations , with a radial velocity of @xmath47 .",
    "when left unaccounted for , this contribution limited the precision of our radial velocity and flux ratio measurements for the inner binary . to correct for this , we used a one - dimensional correlation to determine that the wide companion spectrum was well matched with a k5 type template and contributed about half of the total flux .",
    "we then used the template spectrum to subtract out this contribution prior to the normal two - dimensional cross - correlation step . in this manner",
    ", we increased the precision of our inner binary velocity measurements and decreased the uncertainty on @xmath48 by a factor of two over that obtained when not accounting for the wide companion .    using the component masses derived by @xcite and the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bcah ) stellar models , we estimate that the wide companion to vb  102 contributes only @xmath49 of the total flux at 1.6@xmath31",
    ". additionally , its position angle @xcite placed it near the edge or outside of the cshell slit during our observations .",
    "if the outer binary is in a circular orbit , its period is @xmath50 years , and the velocity separation from the inner binary @xmath25-velocity is only a few @xmath29 .",
    "additionally , the radial velocity of the inner binary primary was only a few @xmath29 from the @xmath25-velocity during our observations .",
    "consequently , any contamination in our spectra from the outer companion was masked by the primary and we were unable to detect it ; we therefore solved vb  102 as a normal sb2 .",
    "the wide companions of vb  151 and vb  40 have large angular separations and were at position angles such that they fell outside of the cshell slit during our observations .",
    "even had they fallen within the slit , their contributions to the total flux are small at 1.6@xmath31 , @xmath49 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "we did not detect any contribution from the wide companion in either system , and concluded that our sb2 correlation analyses of the inner binaries were unaffected .",
    "with the permission of rps and dwl , we list in columns 27 of table  [ table : orbitparams ] the cfa orbital parameters for the 25 sb1s that we succeeded in turning into sb2s with infrared detections ; the seven sample members for which we did not detect the secondary (  [ irccorr ] ) are not included .",
    "the cfa parameters are based on preliminary orbital solutions that may change slightly when the final results are published , but these changes are expected to be insignificant for our present purposes because the uncertainties in our final mass ratios are dominated by the infrared velocities for the secondaries .",
    "we have from one to three infrared spectra for most our binaries , and none were observed on more than five occasions .",
    "this contrasts with the several tens or more visible light observations for each system .",
    "consequently , the primary velocities that we measured in the infrared do not further improve the precision of the sb1 parameters . to solve each system as an sb2",
    ", we took , without modification , the sb1 parameters from table  [ table : orbitparams ] , and used a least - squares fitting routine to solve the infrared @xmath52 measurements for @xmath48 .",
    "for several of our binaries ( vb 62 , vb 69 , h532 , vb102 , vb 142 , vb 121 , and vb 151 ) , this procedure yielded reduced chi - squared , @xmath53 , much greater than one , indicating that the corresponding @xmath52 uncertainties (  3.3 ) are underestimated . assuming that the missing uncertainty contribution in @xmath52 is normally distributed , we account for it by scaling the measured @xmath48 uncertainty by @xmath54 . because we do not understand the source of this additional velocity uncertainty , we choose to retain in table  [ table : obslog ] the uncertainties derived in  [ irccorr ] . to maintain consistent results throughout our sample",
    ", we applied this correction to all of the binaries ; column 8 of table  [ table : orbitparams ] lists the derived @xmath48 along with the adjusted uncertainties .",
    "we list in column 9 of table  [ table : orbitparams ] the mass ratio for each system , calculated from @xmath24 and @xmath48 as @xmath55 .",
    "we verified @xmath6 for the seven sb2s with large @xmath53 using the technique of @xcite ; in each case , these results agree to within @xmath56 of those from the least - squares fitting .",
    "the uncertainty we report for @xmath6 includes the unlisted uncertainty on @xmath24 from the preliminary cfa sb1 solution .",
    "this contribution , however , is generally negligible when compared with the large uncertainties on @xmath48 .",

    "the primary velocity curves shown come directly from the sb1 solutions , while the only free parameter in the secondary velocity curve is @xmath48 .",
    "we show the secondary velocity uncertainties listed in table  [ table : obslog ] , without the scaling correction described earlier , because these values represent our best understanding of the measurements . as a consequence ,",
    "some of the velocities are shown with underestimated uncertainties .",
    "figure  [ fig : qhist ] shows two different representations of the mass ratio distribution for these binaries : ( _ a _ ) shows the case where each @xmath6 is determined with equal precision ; ( _ b _ ) distributes each measured @xmath6 over its corresponding uncertainty .",
    "the similarity of the distributions , within the reported @xmath61 uncertainties , suggests that our underestimate of the @xmath52 uncertainties has a small effect on the overall distribution .",
    "these distributions are obviously not complete for the cluster , most importantly because it does not include the large sample of binaries with @xmath62 that are detected as sb2s in the cfa visible light spectroscopy .",
    "figure  [ fig : qhist ] does , however , clearly demonstrate the applicability of infrared observations to binaries with small mass - ratios .",
    "alternate sb1 orbits are available in the literature for nine of our infrared binaries : eight by r.  f.  griffin and colleagues @xcite and one by @xcite .",

    "however , we did not attempt to reconcile the various velocity zero points , which have small differences of order @xmath63 or less ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this issue is independent of the large uncertainties we report on @xmath6 for l57 , which result from our observing it only once in the infrared .",

    "four of the sb2 solutions shown in figures  [ fig : sb2plots1 ] and [ fig : sb2plots2 ] depend on a single measurement of the secondary velocity , and another nine on only two measurements .",
    "consequently , many of the derived @xmath48 s , and the resulting @xmath6 s , have large uncertainties .",
    "figure  [ fig : qvsqmin ] plots @xmath28 against the measured @xmath6 s to evaluate the plausibility of the measured values . as expected , @xmath6 is greater than or within @xmath56 of @xmath28 for all of the binaries , except vb  59 and h382 which are consistent with @xmath28to better than @xmath68 . both vb  59 and h382 have long periods and were observed at orbital phases where the velocity separation was small , resulting in low precision measurements of @xmath48 .",
    "however , we have two observations of each system at slightly different phases and the measured secondary velocities are consistent",
    ". therefore , we are confident that we are detecting the secondary in both of these systems . observations of vb  59 in @xmath69 and of h382 as soon as @xmath70 , when the orbital phases will have changed significantly , would further improve the sb2 solutions for these systems .",
    "the flux ratio , @xmath7 , measured by our cross - correlation routine offers an additional validation of each sb2 solution .",

    "h_-band curves calculated from bcah for binaries with primary masses from 0.6@xmath11 to 1.2@xmath11 .",
    "two factors complicate a direct comparison between our measured flux ratios and the theoretical values .",
    "first , the small wavelength range of cshell spectra severely limits our ability to measure precise flux ratios because individual spectral lines vary only a small amount relative to each other with changing spectral type .",
    "considerably more accurate flux ratios can be measured with spectra covering a larger wavelength range , and thereby having many more spectral lines with differing dependencies on spectral type .",
    "second , the theoretical curves represent the integrated flux over the entire _ h_-band , of which our cshell spectra only sample @xmath71 .",
    "nonetheless , our measured values are well grouped along the curves .",
    "the two obvious outliers are l79 and vb  142 .",
    "we have only a single , low s / n observation of the long period binary l79",
    ". our measured flux ratio is poorly constrained , varying significantly depending on the exact pair of templates used ; the uncertainty shown in the figure probably underestimates the actual uncertainty . however , our measured secondary velocity is well constrained , independent of the template pair , and we are confident that the secondary detection is real . vb  142 has a very small mass ratio , making the measurement of the companion particularly difficult ;  [ vb142 ] addresses this system in detail .",
    "our infrared observations failed to detect the secondary in seven systems : vb  8 , vb  30 , vb  39 , h411 , l77 , l90 , and vb  114 .",
    "figure  [ fig : qminhist ] shows the distribution of @xmath28 for the infrared sample binaries ; the systems not detected as sb2s are indicated by the hashed region .",
    "we expected that our sensitivity to binary companions would be incomplete for systems with the smallest mass ratios because these systems also have small flux ratios .",
    "however , several of the systems for which we did not detect the secondary have large @xmath28 . for three additional systems , vb  43 , l57 , and h509",
    ", we did not detect the secondary in a subset of our observations .",
    "we address each of these ten systems below .",
    "vb  8 and vb  30 have rapidly rotating f - type primary stars and both have small @xmath28 , 0.15 and 0.19 , respectively .",
    "we observed both spectra in the infrared at multiple epochs , with orbital phases where the predicted velocity separation was large .",
    "we propose two possible explanations for our failure to detected these companions .",
    "the true value of @xmath6 may actually be close to @xmath28 .",
    "for a given mass ratio , the _ h_-band flux ratio of a binary decreases as the mass of the primary increases .",
    "because vb  8 and vb  30 have primaries more massive than those of a typical binary in our sample , their flux ratio s may be too small to detect the secondaries at the s / n of our spectra . alternatively , if the companions are also rotating rapidly , their spectral lines would be too broad to measure with cshell s limited wavelength coverage , even with high s / n observations .",
    "vb  114 and vb  39 have orbital periods of 4578 days and 5083 days , respectively .",
    "our observations of both systems occurred at orbital phases such that the primary velocities were near @xmath25 , and the predicted velocity separations were only a few @xmath29 .",
    "velocity measurements under such conditions are inherently difficult , and even had we detected the secondary components , the resulting @xmath48 s would be poorly constrained .",
    "vb  114 will have a more favorable orbital phase in @xmath122010 ; the phase of vb  39 will not improve until @xmath122013 . both have moderate @xmath28 , 0.44 for vb  39 and 0.29 for vb  114 , so the flux ratios should not impede in detecting these secondaries .",
    "h411 , l77 , and l90 fall towards the faint edge of the distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hmag ] , and our observations of these targets have s / n insufficient to detect their secondaries .",
    "h411 has a small @xmath28 , @xmath72 , which corresponds to a minimum h - band flux ratio of only a few percent , and is at the limit of our best observation of this binary , with s / n@xmath1250 . because h411 is faint ,",
    "obtaining a spectrum with cshell that has better s / n would require many hours of integration ; such an observation could be carried out with a high resolution spectrometer at an @xmath73 m telescope in a relatively small amount of time .",
    "l77 has a large @xmath28 of @xmath74 and we expected to be sensitive to its secondary .",
    "however , our single observation of l77 has s / n@xmath1225 , and occurred at an orbital phase when the velocity separation was small .",
    "the orbit of this system is such that even had we detected the secondary , the resulting sb2 orbit would be largely unconstrained .",
    "l77 will be at a more favorable orbital phase in 2009 .",
    "l90 has @xmath75 ; we observed it on two occasions , each with s / n@xmath1250 .",
    "however , its long period and current orbital phase indicate a small velocity separation",
    ". this system will not be at a more favorable orbital phase until @xmath122011 .",
    "we did not detect a companion in our observations of vb  43 on 2005 sep 30 , l57 on 2005 nov 25 and 2006 feb 2 , and h509 on 2005 oct 2 .",
    "each of these observations were carried out at orbital phases corresponding to primary velocities near @xmath25 .",
    "the observation of vb  43 was compromised further by a low s / n , relative to our other observations of it .",
    "l57 has small @xmath24 and @xmath48 , which when combined with it s k2 primary spectral type make it a difficult target to observe with cshell : future observations would benefit from higher spectral resolution or a larger free spectral range .",
    "our four infrared observations of vb  142 provided good phase coverage , and included measurements near the maximum velocity separation and on both sides of the @xmath25-velocity . despite this , the sb2 solution that we derive is poorly determined and the residuals , @xmath76 , are large .",
    "we do not fully understand the reasons behind this poor solution , but we include it here for the following reasons .",
    "our observations , except for that on 2005 november 28 , return plausible velocities for the companion , albeit with large uncertainties .",
    "the 2005 november 28 observation occurred at phase @xmath77 , and with small velocity separation , so our inability to accurately measure the secondary in this spectrum is not surprising .",
    "the average @xmath7 that we measure for all of the observations , @xmath78 , is , however , much larger than that predicted by bcah ( figure  [ fig : qvsalpha ] ) . to investigate this discrepancy we used our m - type template lhs2351 to introduce an additional spectrum into",
    "our observed vb  142 spectra from 2004 october 1 and 2005 february 22 .",
    "we added in this component with a `` true '' flux ratio , @xmath79 , ranging from 0.05 to 0.0001 , and , to avoid confusion with the actual vb  142 companion , at a radial velocity of @xmath80 .",
    "we then attempted to recover this signal with our correlation procedure and the set of templates used in the original vb  142 analyses , excluding lhs2351 .",
    "we recovered the lhs2351 spectrum at the proper velocity with @xmath79 as small as 0.0005 .",
    "however , the uncertainty of the measured velocity increased as @xmath79 decreased , and the measured flux ratio , @xmath81 became unreliable for @xmath82 .",
    "consider , for example , the case of lhs2351 introduced into the 2005 february 22 spectrum with a radial velocity of -20@xmath29 and @xmath83 .",
    "our correlation routine recovered this signal with a velocity of @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the larger than expected @xmath81 is consistent with the results obtained for the vb  142 companion , and may arise because our primary templates do not precisely match the vb  142 primary spectrum . for small flux ratios",
    ", the correlation routine tries to correct for this mismatch by scaling the primary using @xmath7 ; we have previously reported this behavior @xcite .",
    "our modeling with lhs2351 gives us confidence that we can detect a companion with a very small flux ratio .",
    "the @xmath6 that we derive for vb  142 , @xmath86 , is consistent with @xmath87 from the sb1 solution .",
    "whatever the true value of @xmath6 may be , our @xmath88 upper limit of @xmath89 is very small .",
    "our primary goal in this endeavor is to measure the binary mass ratio distribution for the hyades (  1 ) : @xmath6 for vb  142 is sufficiently well determined for this purpose . of additional interest ,",
    "the primary of vb  142 is a g5 star , and so a companion with @xmath2 could be a brown dwarf , which would be an important discovery in the hyades @xcite .      while spectroscopic observations of an sb2 yield its dynamical mass ratio , they do not measure its orbital inclination and so alone they can not provide a dynamical measurement of the individual component masses .",
    "observations of the visual orbit measure the inclination and the total mass , and when combined with the mass ratio result in the individual masses .",
    "all of the binaries in our sample have components with a small angular separation and their visual orbits are not currently available .",
    "those with periods longer than a few hundred days are resolvable with adaptive optics imaging at a large aperture telescope .    in the absence of visual orbits",
    ", we can still obtain good estimates of the individual masses if the distance is known .",
    "_ hipparcos _ measured the parallax of most of our sample binaries @xcite , and all have precise photometric measurements of their total flux from 2mass at j , h , and k. we combined these with our measured mass ratios and a theoretical mass - luminosity isochrone from bcah to calculate the individual component masses .",
    "we chose the bcah models for several reasons : they show a good , albeit not perfect , agreement with measured dynamical masses @xcite ; they include the effects of atmospheres , which are important in the low mass regime that applies to most of our secondaries ; and lastly , they are provided in a convenient form that specifies magnitudes in the standard photometric bands used by observers .",
    "we used the 625 myr isochrone , while noting that at such an old age the mass - luminosity relationship is mostly insensitive to age .",
    "table  [ table : componentmasses ] lists the calculated component masses .",
    "the uncertainties given in table  [ table : componentmasses ] include contributions from the parallax , photometry , and mass ratio ; they do not include any uncertainties from the bcah models .",
    "all of the 2mass j , h , and k photometric uncertainties are small , @xmath90 mag . because our binaries have small flux ratios , the precision with which we determine the primary masses is mostly dependent on the precision of the parallax measurements . the uncertainty for the secondaries strongly depends on the precision of the mass ratios .",
    "most of the primaries have masses determined to better than 10% , while some of the secondaries approach this level .",
    "_ hipparcos _ did not measure the parallax of vb  59 or l57 , so for these systems we used values reported in the tycho catalog , and the resulting uncertainties on both the primary and secondary masses are large .",
    "the parallaxes of h69 , h441 , and l79 have not been measured , so we estimated their primary masses directly from their spectral type and assumed an uncertainty of @xmath91 .",
    "the secondary masses then follow directly from our measured mass ratios .",
    "finally , the primary of vb  68 is more massive than the range covered by bcah , so for this system only we used the empirical isochrone determined by @xcite and note that the resulting masses are consistent with measured spectral types .",
    "we have obtained high resolution infrared spectroscopy of 32 sbs in the hyades , whose sb1 orbital parameters have been measured by rps and dwl at the cfa , in order to detect their companions and thereby study the binary mass ratio distribution in this young cluster .",
    "we detected the companion in 25 of these systems .",
    "for these , we combined our results with the sb1 parameters to determine their solutions as sb2s .",
    "some of the sb2 solutions we report have low precision for @xmath48 .",
    "however , obtaining precise orbital parameters for individual systems was not our objective here . instead , our intent was to constrain the _ distribution _ of mass ratios in binaries with low mass companions , and our results are sufficient for this purpose .",
    "we also estimated the primary and secondary masses of our sample binaries using 2mass photometry , _ hipparcos _ parallax measurements , and our measured mass ratios .",
    "the mass ratios of the binaries with the most reliable sb2 solutions span the range from @xmath92 , corresponding to secondary masses as small as @xmath1 .",
    "we also detect a very low mass companion to vb  142 . the solution for",
    "its mass ratio is not yet reliable , but it appears to be @xmath89 at the @xmath88 level , and may represent the detection of a brown dwarf companion .",
    "the precision of our derived primary masses is limited by the uncertainties in the _ hipparcos _ parallax measurements .",
    "the secondary mass measurements , however , can be improved significantly by reducing the uncertainties on the measured mass ratios through additional infrared observations .",
    "direct observations of sample members as visual binaries would measure their orbital inclinations and total masses , and when combined with the spectroscopy would yield dynamical component masses . by utilizing the _ hipparcos _ distances , such measurements would contribute a test of the theoretical mass - luminosity relationships ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "improving the sb2 solutions or measuring the visual orbits of our sample would require a significant commitment of observing time and analysis resources .",
    "the visual orbit mapping may require technological improvements in interferometry and adaptive optics techniques .",
    "the results presented here are an initial step in a program to produce distributions of mass - ratio and secondary mass for hyades cluster binaries with periods from a few days to a few thousand days .",
    "future papers in this series will combine our new determinations of mass ratios with available orbital solutions from other hyades binary surveys , including the the spatially resolved systems studied by @xcite , to present the mass ratio and secondary mass distributions for the cluster .",
    "we also intend to address more fully the set of hierarchical triple systems , for which , when combined with the speckle observations of @xcite , we have information on both the inner and outer orbits .    we are grateful to dwl and rps for providing the cfa sb1 parameters and for numerous discussions that improved the manuscript .",
