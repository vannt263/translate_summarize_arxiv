    "transition disks trace a key step in the formation of planetary systems , intermediate between gas - rich protoplanetary disks and debris disks , where primordial gas is cleared away , leaving only remnant dust .",
    "these disks are observationally identified by weak mid - ir emission ( at @xmath115 @xmath5 m ) relative to the taurus median spectral energy distribution ( najita et al .",
    "2007 , i.e. the median sed of primordial disks in the young ( @xmath62 myr ) taurus star - forming region ) .",
    "while numerous physical processes may be responsible for the depletion of gas and dust in transition disks , cleared gaps in particular may be an indicator of a planet or brown dwarf companion in the midst of formation .",
    "thus , these disk systems have been key targets for direct imaging searches for planets .",
    "transition disks tend to be found in young star - forming regions @xmath7100 pc from earth .",
    "only recently have imaging techniques been available to probe the inner portions of these disks , where planets are likely to form . in the last few years",
    ", there have been a number of notable discoveries of companions in transition disks with cleared gaps . via the interferometric sparse - aperture masking",

    "@xcite detected a 0.1 - 0.4 m@xmath8 companion in the disk around the herbig ae / be star hd 142527 .",
    "this binary companion was recently confirmed and shown to be accreting via direct imaging @xcite .",
    "hd 142527 has a particularly wide gap in its disk ( @xmath9 - 120 au , fukugawa et al .",
    "2006 , rameau et al .",
    "2012 , casassus et al .",
    "2012 ) , which may be explained by a stellar companion on an eccentric orbit .",
    "finally , @xcite reported an as yet unconfirmed candidate protoplanet detection in the disk of the herbig ae / be star hd 100546 .",
    "the herbig ae / be star hd 169142 possesses a nearly face - on transition disk , and has been studied in detail both spectroscopically ( meeus et al .",

    "thus , like lkca 15 , hd 142527 , and hd 100546 , it is an excellent candidate to possess a planetary mass or brown dwarf companion in the midst of formation .",
    "adopted stellar parameters are presented in table  [ tab : properties ] .",
    "in general , we adopt the stellar parameters from table 1 of quanz et al . 2013b . an accurate age estimate is particularly important for estimating candidate companion properties ; hd 169142 has been assigned a fairly wide range of ages .",

    "2007 find a comoving companion 9.3  separated from hd 169142 .",
    "this object is a 130 mas separation weak - line t tauri binary , thus they assign an age of 6@xmath12 myr for the entire system . for our analysis here , we thus adopt an age range of 3 - 12 myr .",
    "sylvester et al .",
    "1996 derive a photometric distance of 145 pc to hd 169142 , based on an a5 spectral type ; blondell & djie 2006 update this to 151 pc based on a spectral type of a7v .",
    "as derived spectral type will strongly affect the photometric distance , we adopt a distance range of 145@xmath1310 pc here to account for any uncertainty in spectral typing .",
    "first epoch observations were conducted using the novel annular groove phase mask ( henceforth agpm ) vector vortex coronagraph @xcite with the naco camera at the vlt @xcite .",
    "the agpm coronagraph uses an annular groove phase mask to redirect on - axis starlight out of the pupil @xcite . in this manner",

    "the derotator was turned off to enable azimuthal differential imaging ( adi ) techniques .",
    "seeing varied from 1 - 2@xmath2 over the observation .",
    "we used a base exposure time of 0.25 s with 120 coadds and obtained a total of 1 hour 15 minutes on - sky exposure time .",
    "sky frames were interspersed after every 20 frames and 0.05 s unsaturated exposures were taken at the beginning of the sequence .",

    "eleven science frames ( out of 126 total science frames ) which showed significant cosmetic errors even after sky subtraction were discarded .",
    "each frame was centroided on the raw data using the idl routine mpfit2dpeak .    after basic data reduction and centroiding on the center of the coronagraphic mask using the idl mpfit2dpeak routine",
    ", we analyze the data using 3 independent principal component analysis ( pca ) pipelines ( following the algorithms of soummer et al .",
    "2012 , amara & quanz 2012 ) .",
    "all three pipelines yielded similar results ",
    "we report here the results using the publically available pipeline of dimitri mawet ( http://www.sc.eso.org/@xmath1dmawet/dimitrimawet/idl_pca_pipeline.html ) .",
    "followup observations were conducted using the 585 actuator 1000 hz adaptive secondary ao system ( magao ) at the 6.5 m magellan clay telescope ( close et al .",
    "2013 ) . with 378 corrected modes ,",
    "the magao system is one of the highest sampled ao systems on a large telescope ( @xmath75 m ) and has demonstrated high spatial resolutions ( 20 - 30 mas ) in the visible ( as short as @xmath14 = 0.6  @xmath5 m , close et al .",
    "magao feeds both a visible ( visao , 0.5 - 1 @xmath5 m ) and infrared camera ( clio2 , 1 - 5 @xmath5 m ) simultaneously .",

    "observing details are presented in table  [ tab : observations ] .",
    "four of these datasets were obtained with the clio2 narrow camera including two h band observations , one k@xmath4 band observation , and one 3.9 @xmath5 m 5@xmath15 filter observation .",

    "all magao data was reduced in the standard manner ( flat - field correction , sky - subtraction , bad - pixel correction ) .",
    "the h , k@xmath4 , and z datasets remained unsaturated in the core , thus we align our images using the unsaturated core .",
    "we then process our data using the independent pca - based pipelines of cois rodigas and males ( see e.g. rodigas et al .",
    "2014 and males et al .",
    "both pipelines yielded similar results .    at 3.9 @xmath5 m , we acquired data for hd 169142 as well as for a psf star of similar magnitude .",
    "we achieved very high strehl ratios for both stars in dry , photometric conditions .",
    "seeing remained around 0.4 - 0.6@xmath2 for the entire night .",
    "after image registration , we built a psf from the nearby star images and subtracted the psf from each of our magao / clio2 images of hd 169142 , then rotated to place north up / east left .",
    "our best subtraction is for a psf scaling of 115@xmath15 , which removes the airy rings quite well .",

    "a dataset on hd 142527 was acquired on the same run . the bright hd 142527 disk ( see e.g. fukagawa et al . 2006 , rameau et al .",
    "2012 ) is correctly derotated by the pipeline . for the april 2014 magao data ,",
    "the correct derotation has been validated using images of the trapezium cluster .",
    "l photometry and astrometry was derived for the pointlike feature by inserting scaled psf images into the raw data and selecting the fluxes and positions that best match the actual feature .",
    "best astrometry and photometry is presented in table  [ tab : properties ] .",
    "assuming a point source , our best subtraction yielded @xmath0mag=6.4@xmath130.2 for this feature , at a separation of 0.11@xmath130.03@xmath2 and pa of 0@xmath1314@xmath3 . given that the inner working angle of the vortex coronagraph is 0.09@xmath2 @xcite , this pointlike feature is marginally resolved at best .    to estimate the s / n level of our detection , we calculated the mean and standard deviation in a circular aperture with diameter of @xmath14/d centered on the pointlike feature and in the 6 additional resolution elements available at this separation and then calculated s / n from equation 9 of @xcite ( appropriate for speckle - dominated regions ) : @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the mean within the aperture containing the feature , @xmath18 is the mean of the remaining 6 resolution elements , @xmath19 is the standard deviation of the remaining 6 resolution elements , and @xmath20 is the number of resolution elements not containing the feature .",
    "we find s / n@xmath16 for the detected feature , thus this detection is unlikely to be a false positive  a result which is further bolstered by the independent detection of the same feature by reggiani et al .",
    "initially assuming purely photospheric emission , we estimate mass using monte carlo methods to account for the range of possible ages and uncertainties in photometry for this system .",
    "an ensemble of 10@xmath21 possible ages are drawn from a uniform distribution running from 3 - 12 myr .",
    "an ensemble of 10@xmath21 absolute magnitudes are simulated , assuming gaussian errors on photometry and distance ( 0.3 mag error in @xmath0mag , 10 pc error in distance ) .",
    "we then interpolate with age and single band absolute magnitude to find the best mass for the companion from the dusty and cond models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "mass range histograms are presented in fig .",
    "2 . adopting a 3 - 12 myr age range at a distance of 145 pc and the dusty models",
    ", this candidate would correspond to a relatively high mass 60 - 80 m@xmath22 brown dwarf .",
    "no counterpart to the l detection was found in the april 2014 magao followup .",
    "our non - coronagraphic 3.9 @xmath5 m followup imaging was too shallow to retrieve the pointlike feature ( @xmath0mag=5.6 at 0.11  ) .",
    "however , a 60 - 80 m@xmath22 object at these ages should have been quite bright in the near - ir ( h band absolute magnitude @xmath67 ) and have been easily detected given our h and k@xmath23 sensitivity . indeed , our sensitivity is sufficient to detect a @xmath17 - 15 m@xmath22 object at this separation and age range .",
    "such a high - mass companion should open up a very wide gap in the disk , inconsistent with the ring at similar radii observed polarimetrically by quanz et al .",
    "the lack of a near - ir counterpart to the l detection signifies that we are not observing the photosphere of a substellar object here but may be a potential disk feature its extremely red colors indicate that it is extraordinarily unlikely to be a background .    we performed radiative transfer calculations to investigate whether or not a passively heated disk feature can reproduce the observed point - like source .",
    "we used the best fit disk model parameters from maaskant et al .",
    "2013 to describe an axisymmetric disk . then to simulate a clump we increased the pressure scale height in the disk .",
    "the scale height was increased as a 2d gaussian centered on the observed point source with an fwhm of 7au and a peak perturbation of 30% .",
    "we used 0.1@xmath5 m size astronomical silicates for the dust opacity to get an upper limit on the scattered light perturbations .",
    "larger grains would scatter preferentially forward , perpendicular to the line of sight , which would decrease the contrast between the clump and the central star .",
    "then we measured the contrast on the calculated l images .",
    "we find that a `` dust clump '' at the position of our candidate would have a contrast of @xmath117 mag ( 1@xmath2410@xmath25 ) between the star and the clump , much fainter than the detected candidate .",
    "this result is not surprising , given the distance of the pointlike feature from the star .",
    "assuming we observe only thermal dust emission from an irradiated clump , if the clump peaks at l , it would have t@xmath1850 k. thus , adopting this as the maximum temperature of a potential dust clump , an irradiated clump with this temperature would be at a distance of the order of 0.6 au ( considering temperature and radius of the primary from quanz et al .",
    "2013b ) , inconsistent with the @xmath710 au separation of this detection .",
    "tentatively , we consider this candidate to be a disk feature heated by an as yet unknown mechanism .",
    "we also marginally detected a candidate companion in h and ks with a separation of @xmath10.18  and a pa of @xmath133@xmath3 , but at low significance ( s / n=3 - 5 , using the same procedure as for the pointlike l feature ) .",
    "these data were taken at two different nods , with very different looking psfs in the two nods , limiting the precision of our photometry to @xmath130.5 mag .",
    "thus , while this point source was detected in two different bands on 3 nights ( with s / n@xmath15 in the first dataset , but only s / n@xmath13 in the additional datasets ) , it requires confirmation at an additional epoch , with a more stable psf , to verify common proper motion and rule out imaging and reduction artifacts .",
    "if real and purely photospheric , this candidate would be a 8 - 15 m@xmath22 planet / substellar object ( dusty and cond models ) .",
    "no corresponding l counterpart was found in the july 2013 l vortex dataset .",
    "if purely photospheric , the l counterpart to this object is expected to have an absolute magnitude @xmath78.5 mag ( dusty or cond models ) , corresponding to an apparent magnitude of @xmath714.3 mag .",
    "this is considerably below our achieved contrast for this dataset at this separation ( limiting magnitude of @xmath112.7 , from insertion and retrieval of psf images into the raw data ) .",
    "we also do not see a counterpart to this point source in our deep magao / visao z dataset , down to a contrast of 10@xmath26 .",
    "if real , the very red colors of this object are inconsistent with background stars with spectral types earlier than mid to late m.",
    "the known geometry of this disk limits the potential masses of companions associated with imaged asymmetries .",
    "quanz et al .",
    "2013b image an inner dust ring peaking at 25 au and an annular gap from 40 - 70 au .",
    "the l detection lies within the 25 au dust ring and may be connected to ongoing companion formation in the disk .",
    "if associated with a massive object , it may have had some role in clearing out the region inside this ring .",
    "our tentative h / k detection does not lie within the 40 - 70 au gap but is coincident with the 25 au dust ring .",
    "this suggests that any substellar / planetary counterpart to this tentative detection can not be very massive , as a massive object ( @xmath270.55 m@xmath22 should completely clear away dust from its immediate environment ( kley @xmath10 nelson , 2012 ) .",
    "if massive objects are associated with these detections , they would be some of the closest companions imaged to date . among",
    "confirmed directly imaged exoplanets , only @xmath11 pic b , hr 8799d , and hr 8799e have comparably small projected separations ( lagrange et al .",
    "2010 , marois et al . 2008 , 2010 ) .",
    "some disk asymmetries detected via sparse aperture masking ( sam ) have been described due to forward scattering off an inclined disk ( e.g. cieza et al .",
    "2013 , olofsson et al .",
    "2013 ) . however , hd 169142 is nearly face on ( quanz et al .",
    "2013b ) , so forward scattering can not have produced any observable structure in this case .",
    "our l detection is also not well - described by dust features heated only by the central star ; it is simply too far from the star to be heated enough to produce the observed emission .",
    "however , bright disk - related features have been observed in other transition disks .",
    "for instance , kraus et al .",
    "2013 detect bright asymmetries via sparse aperture masking in h , k , and l band within the 15 - 40 au inner gap in the pre - transitional disk v1247 orionis .",
    "these asymmetries are not well - fit by a companion model ; these authors attribute these features to spiral features or accretion streams due to the interaction of the dust disk with the substellar bodies inside the gap responsible for its clearing .",
    "kraus & ireland 2012 detect a protoplanet candidate ( also via sparse aperture masking ) around lkca 15 . while their detection is well fit by a single point source at k , the l detection appears extended and not entirely coincident with the k detection .",
    "they interpret the k detection as the protoplanet itself and the l detection as circumplanetary material potentially shocked and heated by jets from the protoplanet .    in the case of hd 169142",
    ", the possible energy source for the observed l disk feature remains unknown .",
    "as previously noted , the lack of a h / k counterpart rules out photospheric emission and the l detection is too strong to be described by passive heating from the star .",
    "if due to jets or accretion onto a forming planetary companion , we would expect a h@xmath28 counterpart to the l detection ( close et al .",
    ". however , follette et al . in prep have observed hd 169142 with magao in h@xmath28 and do not detect an h@xmath28 counterpart to the l disk feature .",
    "the l detection may be related to emission line regions inside the hd 169142 disk .",
    "habart et al .",
    "2006 found strong 3.3 @xmath5 m pah emission ( from a c - h stretching feature of neutral pahs ) in the hd 169142 disk out to 0.3  ( using high - resolution ao - supported naco long - slit spectroscopy and along a slit oriented north to south , i.e. intersecting our detection ) .",
    "maaskant et al .",
    "2014 also find strong pah emission ( however , primarily in ionized features ) in the hd 169142 disk , likely stemming from the inner disk gap .",
    "a weak blue leak ( on order 1@xmath15 ) in the naco l filter might allow us sensitivity to pah features in the disk .",
    "if our l feature is indeed due to pah emission , future 3.3 @xmath5 m follow - up observations should easily retrieve this feature .",
    "we report the detection of a faint pointlike structure in the hd 169142 transition disk , also independently detected by reggiani et al . 2014 .",
    "this structure has @xmath0mag(l)@xmath16.4 , at a separation of @xmath10.11@xmath2 and pa of @xmath10@xmath3 .",
    "given its lack of an h or k@xmath4 counterpart despite its relative brightness , this object can not be due to the photosphere of a substellar or planetary mass companion and must instead be a disk feature .",
    "however , the observed l detection is too strong to be described by passive heating from the star and ongoing accretion is ruled out by the magao h@xmath28 non - detection of follette et al . in prep .",
    "while the location of the l pointlike feature right within the disk gap strongly suggests it may be connected to ongoing planet - formation ( i.e. whatever process cleared out the gap ) , the energy source fueling this feature without producing a corresponding near - ir counterpart still remains mysterious .",
    "hopefully , future multi - wavelength followup observations will elucidate the source of this feature  and perhaps in the process refine our understanding of ongoing planet - formation in this disk .",
