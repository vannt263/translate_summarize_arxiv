    "the rich variety of the physical and chemical properties of nanoscale materials is used in a wide range of advanced technological applications .",
    "graphene , a single layer of graphite with c atoms tightly packed in a honeycomb lattice @xcite , is one of the most promising low - dimensional nanomaterials , attracting immense interest of both experimentalists and theoreticians @xcite because of its two - dimensional ( 2d ) structure and unique properties . in both pristine graphene and graphite no magnetic ordering is expected , by experiment and theory . however , there are various experimental methods to induce magnetism : hybridization between the c @xmath1 and ni @xmath2 states @xcite , ion implantation @xcite , proton irradiation of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite @xcite , and point defects @xcite .",
    "ferromagnetism can be induced in multilayered graphene by randomly removing single c atoms @xcite . theoretically , spin - polarization has been confirmed for various c defects @xcite , adsorption of molecular oxygen and hydrogen on graphene @xcite , and substitutional mn doping of graphene @xcite .",
    "inducing spin - polarization in graphene by doping transition metal ( tm ) atoms @xcite is important because it can lead to scattering @xcite and modify the electronic states locally , which is required for graphene - based electronics and kondo physics",
    ". often , very simplistic assumptions about the effects of the tm atoms are not valid , but the properties depend strongly on the host @xcite .",
    "furthermore , precise knowledge of the tm - c interaction is important for understanding carbon nanotube growth @xcite , fuel cells @xcite , and the role of implanted magnetic atoms , such as fe , for the magnetic order @xcite . for these reasons",
    "it is surprising that tm intercalation in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) graphitic network has not been studied with respect to the modifications of the interlayer interaction . in this paper",
    ", we will present first - principles results on the spin - polarization induced by mn , fe , co , ni , and cu atoms intercalated between adjacent c layers .",
    "we study two types of stacking : aaa , which results in multilayer graphene , and aba , which results in bulk graphite .",
    "the different @xmath2 valences of the tm atoms result in a range of induced magnetic moments ( magnitude and spatial distribution ) as needed for spintronic applications .",
    "calculations based on density functional theory @xcite are carried out using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) and the plane wave quantum - espresso code @xcite , which already has been used successfully for describing graphene @xcite .",
    "a strong corrugation of the crystal potential is present in layered materials in the direction perpendicular to the atomic planes .",
    "consequently , the local density approximation is not valid .",
    "even though the van - der - waals forces are neglected in both the local density approximation and the gga , the gga leads to a reasonable matching of the interlayer distances with experiments and is adequate for systems with an inhomogeneous charge density @xcite .",
    "we apply perdew - burke - ernzerhof pseudopotentials @xcite and include an onsite coulomb interaction correction . in our calculations",
    "scalar relativistic effects are included , while spin - orbit coupling is not taken into account as it is negligible in the present systems .",
    "the value of the onsite interaction @xmath3 is varied between 0 and 8 ev .",
    "our results show that it is essential to use a non - zero @xmath3 for the @xmath2 electrons of the tm atoms .",
    "previous findings suggest that @xmath3 ( which is mainly an atomic property ) ranges from 1 to 5 ev for tm atoms @xcite . for @xmath4",
    "ev our results are qualitatively similar with small variations in bond lengths and magnetic moments ( @xmath5% ) .",
    "hence , we will discuss data for @xmath6 ev in the following , unless specifically mentioned .",
    "a large @xmath3 of 8 ev leads to a reduced cohesive energy and to overestimated magnetic moments , especially in the case of mn .",
    "all calculations are performed with a plane wave cutoff energy of 408 ev .",
    "we use a monkhorst - pack @xcite 16@xmath716@xmath74 k - mesh for the calculation of the band structure and density of states ( dos ) @xcite .",
    "we find that a 3@xmath73 supercell is large enough to avoid drawbacks of the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "our supercell contains 36 c atoms and one dopant in all cases , with a unit cell length of 7.45    in the @xmath8-plane .",
    "the length of the @xmath9-axis is relaxed ( @xmath107  ) .",
    "it was suggested that the energy cost associated with the formation of two separated magnetic moments is given by the rkky coupling between two magnetic impurities embedded in a metal , which decays slowly with the separation of the impurities in the case of a low - dimensional system .",
    "consequently , inclusion of this effect would demand a huge unit cell with several magnetic impurities , exceeding reasonable computational resources .",
    "we fully relax the positions of all the atoms , including the dopants , in order to obtain the minimum energy configuration .",
    "we continue the optimization until an energy convergence of 10@xmath11 ev per supercell and a force convergence of 0.04 ev /   is reached . to avoid trapping of tm atoms in local energy minima",
    "we start have studied different starting configurations where the tm atom is located above either the bridge site ( center of a c@xmath12c bond ) , or the hollow site ( center of a c hexagon ) or the top site ( top of a c atom ) .",
    "the final lowest energy structures are tabulated in fig .  1 .",
    "our data suggest that the tm atoms prefer being accommodated in different sites when intercalated in aaa and aba hosts . in aaa stacking fe , co , ni , and cu atoms tend to move towards the hollow site , while mn atoms ( smallest atomic number @xmath13 ) prefer to remain next to a c atom and form an almost linear c@xmath12mn@xmath12c bond . however , in aba stacking mn , fe , co , and ni atoms favor the hollow site of one c layer , which is the top site of the next c layer , see fig .  1 .",
    "cu atoms ( highest @xmath13 ) are slightly off - centered as compared to the other atomic species .",
    "the observed structural variations can be explained by the crystal field splittings which apply to the @xmath2 orbitals of the different tm atoms .",
    "if a spatially symmetric negative charge is placed around a particular tm atom , the @xmath2 orbitals remain degenerate .",
    "however , being itself negatively charged the tm atom experiences repulsion and the orbital energies are raised .",
    "as in our case the field results from electrons in the c layers on both sides of the tm atom , the charge distribution is not spherical and the degeneracy of the @xmath2 orbitals is lifted . the effect is stronger for atoms with partially filled @xmath2 orbitals ( fe , co , ni , and cu ) , which thus tend to distort away from the trigonal symmetric position and form a tetrahedral - like structure with the c atoms .",
    "this is clearly visible in the left column of fig .  1 .",
    "the average c@xmath12tm@xmath12c bond angles for mn , fe , co , ni , and cu turn out to be 180@xmath14 , 143@xmath14 , 151@xmath14 , 144@xmath14 , and 155@xmath14 in aaa stacking and 143@xmath14 , 139@xmath14 , 141@xmath14 , 141@xmath14 , and 164@xmath14 in aba stacking .",
    "the mn atom , being exactly half filled , experiences only a weak effect and retains the trigonal symmetry , forming a linear c@xmath12mn@xmath12c bond . in the aba stacking",
    "there is additional negative charge due to the c @xmath1 orbitals . here , the shift of neighboring c layers within the @xmath8-plane offers the tm atoms a tetrahedral - like geometry .",
    "however , the unpaired electron of the cu atom results in some off - centering .",
    "we address the cohesive energy ( @xmath15 ) in table i in order to describe the stability of the different structures .",
    "the cohesive energy per atom is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the ( spin - polarized ) total energy of a cell containing @xmath18 atoms . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the total energies of isolated c and dopant atoms , respectively .",
    "they are calculated by placing a single atom in a sufficiently large cubic unit cell of @xmath1011   lateral length , in order to avoid interaction with the periodic image .",
    "the calculated magnetic moment , smallest distance between the tm atom and its nearest neighbor c atom , cohesive energy , change of the in - plane c@xmath12c bond lengths , and estimated buckling are summarized in table i. in aaa stacking the tm@xmath12c bond length for mn is 2.00  , while it varies for fe , co , ni , and cu in the ranges 2.03 to 2.26  , 2.01 to 2.04  , 1.92 to 2.18  , and 1.97 to 1.98  , respectively . in aba stacking the tm@xmath12c bond lengths for mn vary in the range 2.00 to 2.39  , while for fe , co , ni , and cu we obtain 2.02 to 2.19  , 2.02 to 2.30  , 1.96 to 2.22  , and 1.97 to 2.19  , respectively .",
    "both the bond lengths and bonding energies in table i indicate that the bonding between the tm atoms and the c layers is covalent . a significant buckling",
    "is observed in the c layers due to the repulsion of the tm charge , amounting to 0.185  , 0.093  , 0.168  , 0.107  , and 0.098   ( aaa stacking ) and 0.118  , 0.015  , 0.079  , 0.044  , and 0.098   ( aba stacking ) for mn , fe , co , ni , and cu , respectively .",
    "the buckling is calculated as the difference between the @xmath21-coordinates of the highest and lowest c atoms in a particular layer .",
    "the in - plane c@xmath12c bond lengths range from 1.43   to 1.45   in all structures , showing that the sp@xmath22-hybridized nature of the in - plane bonding is retained .",
    "e@xmath23 and the bonding strength decrease monotonically with increasing onsite interaction @xmath3 ( with a slight exception for fe ) , see the top panels of fig .",
    "this has a clear but limited effect on the magnetic properties induced by the dopants , as is evident from the bottom panels of fig .  2 .",
    "we note that mn shows a saturation of the magnetization with increasing @xmath3 , consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas for @xmath3 = 8 ev the magnetization trails off for fe and co. a growing value of @xmath3 will affect more prominently the partially filled @xmath2 systems fe and co. a choice of @xmath6 ev is reasonable for our purpose .",
    "in contrast to mn doped graphene @xcite , mn intercalated graphite develops metallic states , see fig .",
    "3 . the spin - polarized dos for @xmath3 = 4 ev shows",
    "that the presence of the tm enhances the dos at the fermi level .",
    "both stacking schemes induce spin - polarization for mn , fe , and co intercalation , amounting to 4.10 @xmath0 , 3.70 @xmath0 , and 1.97 @xmath0 ( aaa stacking ) and 3.80 @xmath0 , 2.06 @xmath0 , and 1.83 @xmath0 ( aba stacking ) .",
    "ni and cu intercalation does not result in a magnetic state for both aaa and aba stacking .",
    "for all dopants the induced magnetic moment differs in aaa and aba stacking , due to different average c@xmath12tm bond lengths .",
    "the smaller this length , the larger is the magnetization .",
    "the spin density induced by mn , fe , and co is addressed in the 3rd and 5th column of fig .  1 .",
    "the maps show localized magnetic moments on the c atoms , which reveal characteristic patterns of parallel and antiparallel orientations .",
    "when the total magnetic moment decreases along the series mn - fe - co , these localized moments reduce in magnitude .",
    "however , simultaneously a weak spin density develops in the interstitial region between the atomic sites which shows a distinct circular wavy shape .",
    "this delocalized spin - polarization even dominates in the case of co intercalation .",
    "a lwdin charge analysis shows that the mn atom loses almost 0.5 electrons when it is intercalated , with @xmath2 orbital occupations of @xmath105.5 electrons in aaa and @xmath105.6 electrons in aba stacking . due to the trigonal - like crystal field around the mn atom ,",
    "the fivefold degeneracy of the @xmath2 orbitals is lifted and the @xmath24 orbital becomes almost fully occupied ( in a comparatively weak crystal field ) .",
    "hence , the 5.5 electrons in aaa stacking yield local magnetic moments of 3.5 @xmath0 to 4 @xmath0 , while in aba stacking the 5.6 electrons yield a slightly smaller moment .",
    "we find that fe loses almost 0.4 electrons in aaa and 0.3 electrons in aba stacking .",
    "the occupations of the @xmath2 bands are 4.8 and 4.7 , respectively . a stronger crystal field results in partial occupations of the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 orbitals and total magnetic moments of 3.70 @xmath0 and 3.06 @xmath0 for aaa and aba stacking . a very strong crystal field splitting for cu and ni results in partial filling of all @xmath2 orbitals and a prominent out - of - plane bonding of the @xmath2 orbitals with the c @xmath1 orbitals , resulting in zero magnetic moment",
    "analysis of the dos reveals that for mn intercalation and aba stacking the states below the fermi level reveal a strong contribution of the c @xmath27 orbitals , while the states just above the fermi energy are dominated by the mn @xmath2 orbitals . for both aaa and aba",
    "stacking , the dos analysis suggests that the mn atom is in a mn@xmath28 state , where @xmath29 is a small positive number .",
    "the partial @xmath30 , @xmath27 , and @xmath2 occupations reflect the non - ionic character of the bonding . in the case of fe intercalation , for both aaa and aba stacking ,",
    "the states below the fermi level are entirely due to the c @xmath27 orbitals , while the lowest unoccupied states are a mixture of c @xmath27 and fe @xmath2 orbitals . in case of ni and cu intercalation",
    ", we find that the @xmath2 orbitals do not contribute to the electronic states around the fermi level , which mainly originate from c @xmath27 and tm @xmath30 orbitals .",
    "this explains the non - magnetic behavior of ni and cu .",
    "in general a mixing of c @xmath27 and tm @xmath2 states points to a partially covalent character of the tm@xmath12c bond .",
    "in view of the possibility to realize a kondo system by chemisorption of metal atoms on graphene @xcite , we have addressed the behavior of the tm atoms mn , fe , co , ni , and cu when they are intercalated in a 3d graphitic network with aaa and aba stacking . while tm adatoms on pristine graphene",
    "are reported to have bonding energies of some 0.2 ev to 1.5 ev @xcite , we obtain bonding energies between 1.10 ev and 4.23 ev for the systems under investigation . the electronic structure of the graphitic systems is modified significantly after intercalation due to hybridization of the c @xmath1 orbitals with the tm @xmath2 orbitals .",
    "it turns out that mn , fe , and co induce spin - polarization in both stacking configurations , whereas ni and cu result in metallic systems with zero magnetic moment . while graphene is characterized by a high mobility of incorporated tm atoms , the strong preferential bonding of intercalated tm atoms in our case paves the way to graphitic kondo systems .",
