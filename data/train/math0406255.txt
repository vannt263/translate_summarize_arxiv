    "the dynamics of iterated polynomials is today a fairly mature subject , after three decades of activity by many people , building on the pioneering work of douady and hubbard .",
    "given a polynomial @xmath7 of degree @xmath8 , the most important set is the julia set @xmath9 consisting of points @xmath10 which have no neighborhood in which the family of iterates forms a normal family in the sense of montel . specifically for polynomials , one can equivalently start with the set @xmath11 of points which converge to infinity under iteration ( the _ escaping _ points ) ; the complement @xmath12 is known as the _ filled - in julia set _ and consists of the points with bounded orbits . then @xmath13 .",
    "the most important case is when @xmath9 and equivalently @xmath14 are connected .",
    "then there is a conformal isomorphism @xmath15 which conjugates the dynamics of @xmath16 on @xmath17 to the dynamics of @xmath18 on @xmath19 .",
    "the goal is to show that the inverse riemann map @xmath20 extends continuously to the boundaries as a continuous surjection @xmath21 ; this map would provide a topological semiconjugacy between the dynamics of @xmath22 on @xmath23 to the dynamics of @xmath7 on @xmath9 . the set @xmath11 is canonically foliated into _ dynamic rays _ @xmath24 for @xmath25",
    ". the dynamic ray @xmath26 _ lands _ at @xmath27 if the limit @xmath28 exists and equals @xmath29 .",
    "the statement that @xmath30 extends continuously to @xmath23 means that every dynamic ray lands , and the landing points depend continuously on the angle . by carathodory",

    ", the set @xmath11 of escaping points is equally important as for polynomials , but it is much harder to understand : the set @xmath11 is never empty , and it is never a neighborhood of infinity ( because @xmath1 is an essential singularity ) , so there is no riemann map providing convenient coordinates ; but we still have @xmath32 @xcite . in many cases , @xmath11 has no interior and @xmath33 .",
    "eremenko  @xcite has asked whether every ( path ) component of @xmath11 was unbounded .",
    "this has been settled in the affirmative only for the cases of exponential maps @xmath34 @xcite and for the cosine family @xmath35 @xcite : in both cases , every path component of @xmath11 consists of a single curve which terminates at @xmath1 , and whose other end might or might not land in @xmath3 ; if it does , the landing point might or might not escape . only for these rather special maps",
    "is it currently known that the escaping points are organized in the form of dynamic rays . for a larger class of maps , the existence of some curves consisting of escaping points was shown in @xcite .",
    "a description of escaping points for a large class of entire function is currently work in progress by rottenfuer .    in this paper",
    ", we provide the first case of transcendental entire functions in which it is known that the escaping points are organized in the form of dynamic rays , such that every dynamic ray lands and every point in @xmath3 ( which equals the julia set ) is either on a dynamic ray or a landing point of at least one dynamic ray . to our knowledge , this is the first example of a transcendental function for which the julia set equals @xmath3 and the dynamics on all of @xmath3 is described in terms of symbolic dynamics .",
    "in addition , we obtain a surprising result about the hausdorff dimensions of the involved sets : it turns out that the union of all dynamic rays has dimension @xmath4 , while each of the remaining points in @xmath3 ( almost all points in @xmath3 in a very strong sense ! ) is the landing point of one or several rays ( each ray of course has dimension @xmath4 , and so does their union ! ) .    in @xcite",
    ", karpiska had shown that for exponential maps @xmath36 with attracting fixed points ( in particular , @xmath37 ) , the set of landing points of @xmath2 has hausdorff dimension @xmath6 , while @xmath2 has dimension @xmath4 .",
    "this was extended in @xcite to arbitrary exponential maps : not all rays land , and not all rays which land have escaping landing points , but the union of all rays still has dimension @xmath4 , while the set of escaping landing points has dimension @xmath6 ( but planar measure zero ) . in @xcite , the analogous result was shown for arbitrary maps @xmath0 , except that the escaping landing points of @xmath2 have even positive measure ( using mcmullen s result @xcite ) .",
    "the example given in the present paper is maximal possible in the plane . in @xcite ,",
    "our results are discussed and illustrated in special cases , together with an introductory discussion of hausdorff dimension and background from complex dynamics .",

    "we may thus focus on the case that the itinerary of @xmath29 differs from the itineraries of all rays @xmath295 ; however , the number of common entries in the itineraries of @xmath295 and @xmath29 will tend to @xmath1 as @xmath69 .",
    "it now follows that for every ray @xmath295 , there is a @xmath299 such that @xmath300 . for @xmath166 , let @xmath301 be an external address of a dynamic ray in @xmath288 .",
    "one can extract a subsequence from the @xmath301 which converges pointwise to an external address @xmath302 .",
    "this address is necessarily exponentially bounded , and the dynamic ray @xmath101 has a well - defined itinerary which equals that of @xmath29 .    by theorem  [ thmdynraysland ] , the ray @xmath101 lands at some point @xmath303 .",
    "then @xmath29 and @xmath304 have identical itineraries , and both are not on rays .",
    "since @xmath29 does not escape , lemma  [ lemalmostinr ] implies that @xmath305 .",
    "set @xmath306 : the set of landing points of rays .",
    "since the boundary of the partition defining itineraries consists of rays landing at critical points , it follows that every point in @xmath307 either has a well - defined itinerary , or is on the backwards orbit of the set @xmath16 .",
    "it is known from ( * ? ? ?",
    "7 ) that if both critical orbits are strictly preperiodic , then almost every orbit escapes : the set @xmath308 has lebesgue measure zero .",
    "recall that the set @xmath11 consists of the rays together with the landing points of some of the rays , and that @xmath2 denotes the union of the rays .",
    "surprisingly , the set @xmath2 has hausdorff dimension @xmath4 @xcite !    a dimension paradox .",
    "as a corollary , we have shown the following surprising result : the set @xmath2 is a set of hausdorff dimension @xmath4 consisting of uncountably many curves ( `` rays '' ) , and each ray connects @xmath1 to a well - defined landing point in @xmath309 .",
    "conversely , every @xmath310 has one or even several rays in @xmath2 connecting @xmath29 to @xmath1 .",
    "one might have expected that the set of landing points should be `` smaller '' than the set of entire rays , but the opposite is the case : not only does @xmath5 have greater hausdorff dimension than @xmath2 , and not only has it positive or even full lebesgue measure in @xmath3 : it is the complement of the 1-dimensional set @xmath2 ! in other words , we have a partition of @xmath3 into an uncountable union of disjoint sets @xmath311 , where each component @xmath312 consists of one point @xmath313 and one or several rays @xmath314 landing at @xmath315 .",
    "every ray @xmath314 is a one - dimensional curve , and the uncountable union @xmath316 still has dimension @xmath4 , but the union @xmath317 is two - dimensional and has full planar lebesgue measure as the complement of @xmath2 .",
    "remark on possible extensions .",
    "it seems quite likely that for maps @xmath0 in which one or both critical orbits are allowed to be periodic , rather than preperiodic , similar results hold as for our maps : every dynamic ray lands , and every point in the julia set is the landing point of one or several dynamic rays .",
    "however , because of the superattracting cycles the fatou set would be non - empty and the set of landing points would no longer have full measure ( but still positive ) .",
    "every point would be either in @xmath2 , a landing point of finitely many rays , or in a superattracting basin .",
    "one might wonder whether the precise description of the dynamics would allow for analogs of `` pinched disk '' models @xcite or some kinds of combinatorial or even topological renormalization ( although non - continuity of any possible renormalization for exponential maps has recently been shown by rempe  @xcite , and this argument is likely to apply in our cases too ) .    while we have shown that all dynamic rays land , we have not discussed whether the landing points depend continuously on the external address .",
    "in fact , this depends on the topology used in @xmath318 : as a totally ordered space , @xmath318 possesses its `` order topology '' generated by intervals ; with this topology , the landing points do _ not _ depend continuously on the address because very nearby addresses can still have very different minimal potentials .",
    "it is therefore required to endow @xmath318 with a topology which depends on more than finitely many first entries ; this is a matter of separate discussion ."
