    ", enhancing the operating lcls baseline capability becomes a challenging problem , subject to many constraints including low cost , little available time to perform changes ( and to be subtracted from operations ) and almost no risk i.e. guarantee of safe return to the baseline mode of operation . in a previous paper of us",
    "@xcite we began to analyze possibilities for enhancing the lcls baseline subject to the above constraints .",
    "the setup proposed in that paper is based on the insertion of a single , short magnetic chicane setup , which allows one to implement a novel single - bunch self - seeding scheme exploiting a single crystal monochromator , which is extremely compact and can be straightforwardly installed in the lcls baseline undulator .",
    "the setup can be installed in little time , and is not expensive . with the radiation beam",
    "monochromatized down to the fourier transform limit , a variety of very different techniques leading to further improvements of the lcls performance become feasible .",
    "in particular , in @xcite we described an efficient way for obtaining full polarization control at the lcls hard x - ray fel .",
    "we also proposed to exploit crystals in the bragg reflection geometry as movable deflectors for the lcls x - ray transport systems .",
    "the hard x - ray beam can be deflected of an angle of order of a radian without perturbations .",
    "the monochromatization of the output radiation constitutes the key for reaching such result .    with reference to fig .",
    "[ lclsbm1 ] one can appreciate the flexibility of our setup . if the chicane is switched off , the baseline mode of operation is immediately restored , fig .",
    "[ lclsbm1 ] ( a ) .",
    "the self - seeding scheme can be implemented by introducing a wake monochromator @xcite , fig .",
    "[ lclsbm1 ] ( b ) . by retracting the crystal , inserting x - ray mirrors in its place , and",

    "moreover , we will discuss how to further exploit the self - seeding scheme , in combination with a second harmonic after burner ( shab ) .",
    "the lcls team plans @xcite to convert the last five undulator segments of the lcls baseline undulator to shab , fig .",

    "we propose to generate two sase x - ray beams in different parts of the baseline undulator , and spatially separate them with the help of x - ray mirrors introduced in the offset provided by the chicane .",
    "this will allow to simultaneously supply two experiments .",
    "the lcls baseline undulator is long enough to provide two sase x - ray beams at saturation , and very small x - ray mirrors can be used to spatially separate the two x - ray beams .",
    "the gap of the lcls baseline undulator can only be adjusted within a few percent , and therefore the x - ray beam doubler can only operate with coupled wavelengths . normally , if the sase fel operates at saturation , the quality of the electron bunch is too bad for the generation of sase radiation in a subsequent part of undulator , which is resonant at nearly the same wavelength .",
    "we propose to use a method for activating or deactivating sase undulators , based on a rapid switching of the fel amplification process in order to obtain a user doubler @xcite . in the lcls baseline case",
    "a betatron sase switcher @xcite may be practically advantageous .",

    "we performed simulations and studied the properties of the 2nd harmonic of the output radiation , which is also monochromatic due to the implementation of the self - seeding technique .",
    "the setup output will therefore consist of two monochromatic x - ray beams , at the first and at the second harmonic .",
    "monochromaticity is the key for implementing multi - user operation in the hard x - ray range , which can be granted by using crystal deflectors and small absorption of the radiation at @xmath5 kev in crystals .",
    "we suggest to flip crystals for switching of reflectivity very much like polarization - switching techniques with x - ray phase retarders at synchrotron radiation facilities , based on the use of piezoelectric components .",

    "after section [ increase ] , in section [ feas ] and in section [ shab ] , we study feasibility with the help of simulations based on the code genesis @xcite .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] , we come to conclusions .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , substituting a single undulator segment in the lcls baseline with a weak chicane yields a dramatic increase of the lcls capabilities , allowing for many different schemes to be realized without risks for the baseline mode of operation . in this section we discuss the principles of a method to increase user access in the full photon energy range , based on sase radiation , and to obtain a multi - user facility in hard x - ray range , based on self - seeded radiation .",
    "the method to increase the user access in the full photon energy range , based on sase radiation , is sketched in fig .",
    "[ lclsbm6]-[lclsbm7 ] , and is justified by the length of lcls baseline undulator , which is about two times longer than what is needed to reach saturation at @xmath6 nm wavelength @xcite . the basic idea is to exploit this extra - available length and to obtain two user simultaneous operation at lcls baseline .",
    "the two sase x - ray beams , generated from two different parts of the baseline undulator are spatially separated with the help of x - ray mirrors .",
    "the idea is sketched in fig .",
    "[ lclsbm6 ] .",
    "a sketch of the two x - ray mirrors installed within the magnetic chicane after the first ( 13 cells - long ) part of undulator is shown in fig .",
    "[ lclsbm5 ] .",
    "this insertable mirrors pair can be used to generate a deflection angle of @xmath7 mrad , which does not lead to interception of the fel beam with the vacuum chamber within the undulator , but creates a separation of about @xmath1 mm in the front end enclosure ( fee ) tunnelmm , the footprint on a single mirror at glancing angle of @xmath8 mrad would be about @xmath9 m , too long to be accomodated within the chicane .",
    "the two mirrors in fig .",
    "[ lclsbm5 ] are at a glancing angle of @xmath10 mrad .",
    "this yields a footprint of just @xmath9 cm .",
    "then , in order to introduce a deflection of @xmath7 mrad , one only needs to rotate one mirror with respect to the other of such small amount . ] .",
    "fee mirror systems will subsequently direct the two spatially separated x - ray beams into two experimental stations .",
    "change of the the active part of the undulator is based on rapid switching of the fel amplification process . for the lcls baseline undulator",
    ", we propose to use a method to control the sase amplification process based on betatron switcher @xcite .",
    "using a kicker installed upstream of the lcls baseline undulator and existing correctors located at the end of the first part of the undulator , it is possible to rapidly switch the x - ray beam from one user to another , thus providing two active beamlines at any time , fig .",
    "[ lclsbm7 ] .",
    "the location of the kicker must be chosen such that the betatron phase advance between kicker and corrector is @xmath11 , or a multiple thereof .",
    "the fast kicker operates at a repetition rate of @xmath12 hz , yielding a kick of about 0.01 mrad to every second bunch .",
    "such kick is compensated by using a corrector ( which always gives the same , static kick ) .",
    "after the corrector , any bunch which was initially kicked goes into a straight section , and lases up to saturation in the second part of undulator . in the first part of undulator instead , the trajectory of such any bunch strongly deviates from the straight path , thus inhibiting the lasing process .",
    "when the fast kicker is off , the bunch lases in the first part of the undulator up to saturation . as a result",
    ", two sase beams can be generated from different parts of the undulator with repetition rate @xmath12 hz for each independent user . when the kicker is off , in the second undulator we have a perturbation of the orbit due to the corrector , but this is not important because in this case we already have saturation in the first undulator . in reference",
    "@xcite , a setup with three or more undulators was considered . in our case , where we discuss only about two undulator parts , we deal with much simpler situation .",
    "we also need to have a betatron phase shift of @xmath11 between kicker and corrector , but in our scheme this is not a constraint for the undulator lengths , because the switcher scheme can always be implemented with the proper choice of the kicker position upstream of the baseline undulator .",
    "an idea for obtaining a user doubler at lcls ii was presented in @xcite .",
    "there it is propose to tilt the second part of the undulator for obtaining spatial separation between the x - ray beams generated in the first and in the second part of the new soft x - ray undulator .",
    "our idea to use an insertable mirrors pair within a short magnetic chicane for the same purpose , has the advantages that the first and the second part of the undulator can be kept straight , and that can therefore be applied to the lcls baseline .",
    "obviously , such method can be applied to the lcls ii design as well .    if the x - ray mirrors are substituted by a wake monochromator , the self - seeding scheme described in @xcite is applied , fig [ lclsbm1 ] . in this case",
    ", there exists an efficient way for obtaining a multi - user facility at lcls baseline in hard x - ray range , based on self - seeded radiation . to this end",
    ", we propose a photon beam distribution system based on the use of crystals in the bragg reflection geometry as deflectors .",
    "it can be possible to deflect the full radiation pulse of an angle of the order of a radian without perturbations .",
    "the proposed photon beam distribution system would allow to switch the hard x - ray beam quickly between @xmath1 experimental stations in the near and far experimental halls in order to make an efficient use of the lcls source .",
    "the high monochromatization of the output radiation constitutes the key for reaching such results . in @xcite",
    "we described self - seeding setup for lcls baseline . in its simplest configuration ,",
    "a self - seeded fel consists of an input and an output undulator separated by a monochromator .",
    "a distinguishing feature of our method is that it uses a single crystal in bragg transmission geometry as monochromator , installed within the magnetic chicane .",
    "the method has the potential for a decrease of the bandwidth of the output radiation down to the fourier transform limit , given by the finite duration of the pulse . as discussed in the introduction , the lcls baseline undulator design with magnetic chicane proposed in fig .",
    "[ lclsbm1 ] is very flexible and can be used for monochromatization purpose too , fig .",
    "[ lclsbm3 ] .",
    "successful operation of the self - seeding xfel requires the fulfillment of several requirements .",
    "the first undulator part must operate in the deep linear regime , and not at saturation .",
    "calculations show that in order not to spoil the electron beam quality , the number of cells in the first part of undulator should be decreased from @xmath13 down to @xmath14 .",
    "this can be done simply by detuning @xmath10 cells , using the @xmath15-adjustable gap of the lcls baseline undulator . in section [ shab ]",
    "we will demonstrate that for the undulator equipped with shab it is possible decrease the bandwidth of the second harmonoc radiation down to the transform limit as well .",
    "the deflector can be simply switched off by tilting , which results in a change in the angle of incidence of the radiation .",
    "the angular change necessary for switching on and off the reflected beam is less than @xmath16 mrad .",
    "only @xmath17 of the incoming 2 nd harmonic radiation is absorbed in this case.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    dealing with monochromatic radiation one may use crystals as deflector , for both the first and the second harmonic , fig .",
    "[ lclsbm9 ] and fig .",
    "[ lclsbm10 ] .",
    "the first harmonic deflector can be constituted of a silicon crystal , exploiting the 111 reflection in the symmetric bragg geometry .",
    "the thickness of the first harmonic deflector is 0.05 mm .",
    "the second harmonic deflector is diamond plate of 0.05 mm thickness .",
    "it is used in bragg reflection geometry with the c(111 ) reflection plane .",
    "one of the most advantages of crystal deflector in bragg geometry is that the reflected beam is switched only by changing angle .",
    "the typical angular change necessary for the switching is less than @xmath16 mrad .",
    "this opens up a new possibility of fast switching of the reflectivity , which is necessary for multi - user operation . in order to achieve a stable photon beam deflection the rotation error must be less than @xmath18 mrad .",
    "existing technology enables rotating crystals to satisfy these requirements .",
    "for example , at synchrotron radiation facilities , x - ray phase retarder crystals are driven by a piezoelectric device operated at hundred hz repetition rate , which flips the crystals with a rotation error of about a fraction of a microradian @xcite .",
    "we propose to consider a multi - user distribution system based on ( flipping ) crystal deflectors , which will allow all existing user stations to work in parallel with the same high - quality x - ray beams , fig .",
    "[ lclsbm8 ] . the initial second harmonic photon beam at 0.075 nm wavelength will thus be transformed into 5 different beams .",
    "the switching crystals need to flip at a frequency of @xmath19 hz , so that each user ( except the first , which receives the full @xmath20 hz x - ray beam at the first harmonic ) receives 12 x - ray beams per second .",
    "we first consider the scheme in fig .",
    "[ lclsbm6 ] .",
    "a pair of x - ray mirrors is inserted in the transverse offset generated by the magnetic chicane , as described in section [ increase ] .",

    "therefore , our calculations include a relatively large spontaneous emission background , which has a much larger spectral width with respect to the amplification bandwidth and which fluctuates negligibly from shot to shot .",

    "user access is follows from the length of the lcls baseline undulator , which is about two times longer than what is needed to reach saturation at @xmath6 nm wavelength .",
    "quite surprisingly , the user capacity can be increased with the help of an almost trivial setup , composed by two components : a short magnetic chicane , and an insertable x - ray mirrors pair for x - ray beam separation .",

    "we propose to use the self - seeding mode of operation with shab for enabling multi - user mode of operation .",
    "for this we propose to use rapidly and frequently switching crystal deflectors .",
    "this is possible due to the relatively large photon energy ( 16 kev ) , resulting in a small absorption .",
    "switching of deflectors will be provided by a small tilting of the crystal .",
    "such rotation can be realized similarly as for phase retarders for polarization switching in synchrotron radiation facilities .",
    "routine parameters of existing synchrotron radiation facilities ( e.g. petra iii ) allow for a 100 hz repetition rate for the rotation cycle , and a rotation error of @xmath24rad .    as a result ,",
