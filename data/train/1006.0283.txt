    "_ black holes _ are one of the most celebrated predictions of general relativity , and perhaps of mathematical physics in general . a particularly interesting but peculiar example of a black hole spacetime is given by the so - called _ extreme reissner - nordstrm _ metric , which in local coordinates @xmath3 takes the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 @xmath6 is the standard metric on @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( see also appendix [ sec : onthegeometryofreissnernordstrom ] ) .",
    "this spacetime has been the object of considerable study in the physics literature ( see for instance the very recent @xcite ) , but the analysis of its waves has not been adequately studied from a mathematical point of view . in this paper , we shall attempt a more or less complete treatment of the wave equation @xmath9 on extreme reissner - nordstrm .",
    "our main results ( see section [ sec : themaintheorems ] ) include :    1 .   local integrated decay of energy , up to and including the event horizon @xmath2 ( theorem [ th1 ] ) .",
    "2 .   energy and pointwise uniform boundedness of solutions , up to and including @xmath2 ( theorems [ t2 ] , [ t5 ] ) .",
    "3 .   energy and pointwise decay of solutions , up to and including @xmath2 ( theorems [ t4 ] , [ t6 ] , [ theo8 ] ) .",
    "non - decay and blow - up estimates for higher order derivatives of solutions along @xmath2 ( theorem [ theo9 ] ) .",
    "the latter blow - up estimates are in sharp contrast with the non - extreme case , for which decay holds for all higher order derivatives of @xmath10 along @xmath2 .",
    "several new analytical features of degenerate event horizons are also presented .",
    "the above theorems , in particular , resolve open problem 4 ( for extreme reissner - nordstrm ) from section 8 of @xcite .",
    "the fundamentally new aspect of this problem is the degeneracy of the redshift on the event horizon @xmath2 .      before we discuss in detail our results ,",
    "let us present the distinguishing properties of extreme reissner - nordstrm and put this spacetime in the context of previous results .",
    "we briefly describe here the geometry of the horizon of extreme reissner - nordstrm .",
    "( for a nice introduction to the relevant notions , we refer the reader to @xcite ) .",
    "the event horizon @xmath2 corresponds to @xmath11 , where the @xmath12 coordinate system breaks down .",
    "the coordinate vector field @xmath13 , however , extends to a regular null killing vector field @xmath14 on @xmath2 .",
    "the integral curves of @xmath14 on @xmath2 are in fact affinely parametrized : @xmath15 more generally , if an event horizon admits a killing tangent vector field @xmath14 for which holds , then the horizon is called degenerate and the black hole _",
    "extreme_. in other words , a black hole is called extreme if the surface gravity vanishes on @xmath2(see section [ sec : redshifteffectandsurfacegravityofh ] ) . under suitable circumstances ,",
    "the notion of extreme black holes can in fact be defined even in case the spacetime does not admit a killing field ( see @xcite ) .    the extreme reissner - nordstrm corresponds to the @xmath16 subfamily of the two parameter reissner - nordstrm family with parameters mass @xmath8 and charge @xmath17 .",
    "it sits between the non - extreme black hole case @xmath18 and the so - called naked singularity case @xmath19 .",
    "note that the physical relevance of the black hole notion rests in the expectation that black holes are `` stable '' objects in the context of the dynamics of the cauchy problem for the einstein equations . on the other hand",
    ", the so - called weak cosmic censorship conjecture suggests that naked singularities are dynamically unstable ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "that is to say , extreme black holes are expected to have both stable and unstable properties ; this makes their analysis very interesting and challenging .",
    "the first step in understanding the dynamic stability ( or instability ) of a spacetime is by considering the wave equation .",
    "this is precisely the motivation of the present paper . indeed ,",
    "to show stability one would have to prove that solutions of the wave equation decay sufficiently fast . for potential future applications all methods should be robust and the resulting estimates quantitative .",
    "robust means that the methods still apply when the background metric is replaced by a nearby metric , and quantitative means that any estimate for @xmath10 must be in terms of uniform constants and ( weighted sobolev ) norms of the initial data .",
    "note also that it is essential to obtain non - degenerate estimates for @xmath10 on @xmath2 and to consider initial data that do not vanish on the horizon . as we shall see , the issues at the horizon turn out to be the most challenging part in understanding the evolution of waves on extreme reissner - nordstrm .",
    "the wave equation on black hole spacetimes has long been studied beginning with the pioneering work of regge and wheeler @xcite for schwarzschild .",
    "subsequently , a series of heuristic and numerical arguments were put forth for obtaining decay results for @xmath10 ( see @xcite ) . however , the first complete quantitative result ( uniform boundedness ) was obtained only in 1989 by kay and wald @xcite , extending the restricted result of @xcite .",
    "note that the proof of @xcite heavily depends on the exact symmetries of the schwarzschild spacetime .    during the last decade ,",
    "the wave equation on black hole spacetimes has become a very active area in mathematical physics . as regards the schwarzschild spacetime , ",
    "@xmath20 estimates \" providing local integrated energy decay ( see section [ sec : morawetzandxestimates ] below ) were derived in @xcite .",
    "note that @xcite introduced a vector field estimate which captures in a stable manner the so - called _ redshift effect _ , which allowed the authors to obtain quantitative pointwise estimates on the horizon @xmath2 .",
    "refinements for schwarzschild were achieved in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "similar estimates to @xcite were derived in @xcite for the whole parameter range of reissner - nordstrm including the extreme case .",
    "however , these estimates degenerate on @xmath2 and require the initial data to be supported away from @xmath2 .",
    "the first boundedness result for solutions of the wave equation on slowly rotating kerr ( @xmath21 ) spacetimes was proved in @xcite and decay results were derived in @xcite .",
    "decay results for general subextreme kerr spacetimes ( @xmath22 ) are proven in @xcite .",
    "two new methods were presented recently for obtaining sharp decay of energy flux and pointwise decay on black hole spacetimes ; see @xcite . for results on the coupled wave equation see @xcite . for other results",
    "see @xcite . for an exhaustive list of references ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "note that all previous arguments for obtaining boundedness and decay results on non - extreme black hole spacetimes near the horizon would break down in our case ( see sections [ sec : redshifteffectandsurfacegravityofh ] , [ sec : thespacetimetermkn ] , [ sec : conservationlawsondegenerateeventhorizons ] ) .",
    "the reason for this is precisely the degeneracy of the redshift on @xmath2 .",
    "we next describe the results we prove in this paper .",
    "all our estimates are with respect to @xmath23 norms and we mainly use the robust vector field method .",
    "many of our results hold for more general ( spherically symmetric ) extreme black hole spacetimes ( but we shall not pursue this here ) .",
    "we deduce that in some aspects the waves on extreme reissner - nordstrm have stable properties but in other aspects they appear to be unstable ; this result is consistent with our discussion above about extreme black holes .",
    "our analysis begins with local @xmath23 spacetime estimates .",
    "we refer to local spacetime estimates controlling the derivatives of @xmath10 as  @xmath20 estimates \" and @xmath10 itself as  zeroth order morawetz estimate \" .",
    "both these types of estimates have a long history ( see @xcite ) beginning with the seminal work of morawetz @xcite for the wave equation on minkowski spacetime .",
    "they arise from the spacetime term of energy currents @xmath24 associated to a vector field @xmath20 . for schwarzschild",
    ", such estimates appeared in @xcite and for reissner - nordstrm in @xcite .",
    "the biggest difficulty in deriving an @xmath20 estimate for black hole spacetimes has to do with the _ trapping effect_. indeed , from a continuity argument one can infer the existence of null geodesics which neither cross @xmath2 nor terminate at @xmath25 . in our case",
    "these geodesics lie on a hypersurface of constant radius ( see section [ sec : photonsphereandtrappingeffect ] ) known as the _ photon sphere_. from the analytical point of view , trapping affects the derivatives tangential to the photon sphere and any non - degenerate spacetime estimate must lose ( tangential ) derivatives ( i.e.  must require high regularity for @xmath10 ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we first ( making minimal use of the spherical decomposition ) derive a zeroth order morawetz estimate for @xmath10 which does not degenerate at the photon sphere .",
    "for the case @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 is related to the eigenvalues of the spherical laplacian , see section [ sec : elliptictheoryonmathbbs2 ] ) our work is inspired by @xcite and for @xmath28 we present a method which is robust and uses only geometric properties of the domain of outer communications .",
    "our argument applies for a wider class of black hole spacetimes and , in particular , it applies for schwarzschild .",
    "note that no unphysical conditions are imposed on the initial data which , in particular , are not required to be compactly supported or supported away from @xmath2 .",
    "once this morawetz estimate is established , we then show how to derive a degenerate ( at the photon sphere ) x estimate which does not require higher regularity and a non - degenerate x estimate ( for which we need , however , to commute with the killing @xmath14 ) .",
    "these estimates , however , degenerate on @xmath2 ; this degeneracy will be dropped later .",
    "see theorem [ th1 ] of section [ sec : themaintheorems ] .",
    "the vector field @xmath29 is causal and killing and the energy flux of the current @xmath30 is non - negative definite ( and bounded ) but degenerates on the horizon ( see section [ sec : thevectorfieldtextbfm ] ) .",
    "moreover , in view of the lack of redshift along @xmath2 , the divergence of the energy current @xmath31 associated to the redshift vector field @xmath32 , first introduced in @xcite , is not positive definite near @xmath2 ( see section [ sec : thevectorfieldn ] ) . for this reason",
    "we appropriately modify @xmath31 so the new bulk term is non - negative definite near @xmath2 .",
    "note that the arising boundary terms can be bounded using hardy - like inequalities .",
    "it is important here to mention that a hardy inequality ( in the first form presented in section [ sec : hardyinequalities ] ) allows us to bound the local @xmath23 norm of @xmath10 on hypersurfaces crossing @xmath2 using the ( conserved ) degenerate energy of @xmath14 .",
    "note also that the bulk term is not positive far away from @xmath2 and so to control these terms we use the @xmath20 and zeroth order morawetz estimates . see theorem [ t2 ] of section [ sec : themaintheorems ] .",
    "although the bulk term of the modified redshift current is non - negative definite , it degenerates on @xmath2 with respect to the derivative * transversal * to @xmath2 .",
    "this degeneracy is a characteristic feature of degenerate event horizons . indeed , in section",
    "[ sec : conservationlawsondegenerateeventhorizons ] , we show that the lack of redshift along @xmath2 gives rise to a series of conservation laws ( see theorem [ t3 ] of section [ sec : themaintheorems ] ) .",
    "these laws apply for waves which are supported on the angular frequency @xmath27 , i.e.  for which @xmath33 for all @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the projection of @xmath10 ( viewed as an @xmath23 function on the spheres of symmetry ) on the eigenspace @xmath36 of the spherical laplacian @xmath37 ( see section [ sec : elliptictheoryonmathbbs2 ] ) . according to these laws a linear combination of the transversal derivatives of @xmath10 of order at most @xmath38 is conserved along the null geodesics of @xmath2 . as we shall see , it is these conserved quantities that allow us to infer the unstable properties of extreme black holes , and thus , understanding their structure is crucial and essential .",
    "a consequence of these laws is that for generic initial data , the derivatives transversal to @xmath2 for waves @xmath10 which are supported on the low angular frequencies * do not decay * , and if the order of the derivatives is sufficiently high then they in fact * blow up * along @xmath2 .",
    "the genericity here refers to data for which certain quantities do not vanish on the horizon .",
    "based on these conservation laws , we will also prove that the schwarzschild boundedness argument of kay and wald @xcite can not be applied in the extreme case , i.e.  for generic @xmath10 , there does not exist a cauchy hypersurface @xmath39 crossing @xmath2 and a solution @xmath40 such that @xmath41 in the causal future of @xmath39 .",
    "we next return to the problem of retrieving the derivative tranversal to @xmath2 in the @xmath20 estimate in a neighbourhood of @xmath2 .",
    "more generally , we establish @xmath23 estimates of the derivatives of @xmath10 ; see theorem [ theorem3 ] of section [ sec : themaintheorems ] . in view of the conservation laws",
    "one expects to derive @xmath42th order ( @xmath43 @xmath23 estimates close to @xmath2 only if @xmath44 for all @xmath45 .",
    "however , on top of this low frequency obstruction comes another new feature of degenerate event horizons . indeed , to obtain such estimates , one needs to require higher regularity for @xmath10 and commute with the vector field transversal to @xmath2 .",
    "this shows that @xmath2 exhibits phenomena characteristic of trapping ( see also the discussion in section [ sec : trappingeffectonmathcalh ] ) . then by using appropriate modifications and the hardy inequalities we obtain the sharpest possible result .",
    "see section [ sec : higherorderestimates ] . note that although ( an appropriate modification of ) the redshift current can be used as a multiplier for all angular frequencies , the redshift vector field @xmath32 can only be used as a commutator for @xmath10 supported on the frequencies @xmath26 .      using an adaptation of methods developed in the recent @xcite",
    ", we obtain energy and pointwise decay for @xmath10 .",
    "see theorems [ t4 ] and [ t6 ] of section [ sec : themaintheorems ] . in @xcite ,",
    "a general framework is provided for obtaining decay results .",
    "the ingredients necessary for applying the framework are : 1 ) good asymptotics of the metric towards null infinity , 2 ) uniform boundedness of energy and 3 ) integrated local energy decay ( where the spacetime integral of energy should be controlled by the energy of @xmath10 and @xmath46 ) .",
    "we first verify that extreme reissner - nordstrm satisfies the first hypothesis .",
    "however , in view of the trapping on the event horizon @xmath2 , it turns out that the method described in @xcite can not be directly used to yield decay results in the extreme case .",
    "indeed , the third hypothesis of @xcite is not satisfied in extreme reissner - nordstrm .",
    "for this reason , we obtain several hierarchies of estimates in an appropriate neighbourhood of @xmath2 .",
    "these estimates avoid multipliers or commutators with weights in @xmath47 , following the philosophy of @xcite .",
    "our method applies to black hole spacetimes where trapping is present on @xmath2 ( including , in particular , a wide class of extreme black holes ) .",
    "pointwise estimates follow then by commuting with the generators of so(3 ) and sobolev estimates .",
    "we shall also see that the low angular frequencies decay more slowly than the higher ones .",
    "see section [ sec : pointwiseestimates ] .      in order to provide a complete picture of the behaviour of waves",
    "@xmath10 , it remains to derive pointwise estimates for all derivatives of @xmath10 .",
    "we show that if @xmath10 is supported on the angular frequency @xmath27 , then the derivatives transversal to @xmath2 of @xmath10 decay if the order is at most @xmath27 .",
    "if the order is @xmath38 , then for generic initial data this derivative converges along @xmath2 to a non - zero number . as before , by generic initial data we mean data for which certain quantities do not vasish on @xmath2 .",
    "if , moreover , the order is at least @xmath48 , then for generic initial data these derivatives blow up asymptotically along @xmath2 . on the other hand , for @xmath49 one needs to consider the order to be at least @xmath50 so the derivatives blow up . see theorems [ theo8 ] and [ theo9 ] of section [ sec : themaintheorems ] .",
    "therefore , the @xmath14 derivatives decays faster than @xmath10 . ]",
    "slightly counteract the action of the derivatives transversal to @xmath2 .",
    "we conclude this paper by deriving similar decay , non - decay and blow - up results for the higher order energy .",
    "in particular , this shows that one can commute with the redshift vector field at most @xmath27 times for @xmath10 supported on the frequency @xmath27 .",
    "see section [ sec : higherorderpointwiseestimates ] .",
    "we conclude this introductory section by discussing several new features of degenerate event horizons .      in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that for a wide variety of non - extreme black holes , the redshift on @xmath2 suffices to yield uniform boundedness of the non - degenerate energy without any need of understanding the dispersion properties of @xmath10 .",
    "however , in the extreme case , the degeneracy of the redshift makes the understanding of the dispersion of @xmath10 essential even for the problem of boundedness .",
    "in particular , one has to derive spacetime integral estimates for @xmath10 and its derivatives .      according to the results of sections [ sec : commutingwithavectorfieldtransversaltomathcalh ] and [ sec : higherorderestimates ] , in order to obtain @xmath23 estimates in neighbourhoods of @xmath2 one must require higher regularity for @xmath10 and commute with the vector field transversal to @xmath2 ( which is not killing ) .",
    "this loss of a derivative is characteristic of trapping .",
    "geometrically , this is related to the fact that the null generators of @xmath2 viewed as integrals curves of the killing vector field @xmath14 are affinely parametrized .",
    "the trapping properties of the photon sphere have different analytical flavour .",
    "indeed , in order to obtain @xmath23 estimates in regions which include the photon sphere , one needs to commute with either @xmath14 or the generators of the lie algebra so(3 ) ( note that all these vector fields are killing ) . only the high angular frequencies are trapped on the photon sphere ( and for the low frequencies no commutation is required ) while all the angular frequencies are trapped ( in the above sense ) on @xmath2 .",
    "our setting is appropriate for understading the dynamic formation of extreme black holes from gravitational collapse :     [ fig : collapse ]    one can construct spacetimes ( for instance solutions of the einstein - maxwell - scalar field system ) such that the initial hypersurface @xmath51 is complete and asymptotically flat with one end and the spacetime in region @xmath52 coincides with the exterior region of extreme r - n .",
    "consider arbitrary initial data @xmath53 on @xmath1 for the wave equation ( in particular , suppose that their support includes @xmath2 ) . by",
    "( extending and ) solving backwards , we obtain a new initial data set @xmath54 on the initial hypersurface @xmath55 .",
    "the initial data @xmath53 and @xmath54 are isomorphic .",
    "indeed , if one considers a scalar perturbation which corresponds to the data set @xmath54 , then the trace of the perturbation on @xmath1 corresponds to the data @xmath53 .",
    "hence , the support of our initial data on @xmath1 should include @xmath2 .",
    "that is to say , our results represent a poor man s linearisation of the non - linear problem .    in the linear level , the low angular frequencies not only are they trapped on @xmath2 , but their evolution is governed by conservation laws along null generators .",
    "these laws imply that for generic initial data ( i.e.  data for which certain quantities do not vanish on @xmath56 ) , the higher order derivatives transversal to @xmath2 blow up along @xmath2 .",
    "these differential operators are translation invariant and do not depend on the choice of a coordinate system .",
    "the blow - up of these geometric quantities suggests that extreme black holes are dynamically unstable .",
    "we hope that the methods we develop in this paper will be useful for proving such a result in the nonlinear setting .",
    "an important problem is that of understanding the solutions of the wave equation on the extreme kerr spacetime .",
    "this spacetime is not spherically symmetric and there is no globally causal killing field in the domain of outer communications ( in particular , @xmath14 becomes spacelike close to the event horizon ) .",
    "recent results @xcite overcome these difficulties for the whole subextreme range of kerr .",
    "the extreme case remains open .",
    "one could consider the problem of the wave equation coupled with the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "then decay for the scalar field was proven in the deep work of dafermos and rodnianski @xcite .",
    "again these results hold for non - extreme black holes . for extreme black holes",
    "even boundedness of waves remains open .",
    "after its original appearance on the arxiv , this work was subsequently improved with various new results and split into two ( now published ) parts @xcite .",
    "the extreme reissner - nordstrm family is a one parameter subfamily sitting inside the two parameter reissner - nordstrm family of 4-dimensional lorentzian manifolds @xmath57 , where the parameters are the mass @xmath8 and the electromagnetic charge @xmath58 .",
    "the extreme case corresponds to @xmath16 . in the ingoing eddington - finkelstein",

    "the region where @xmath65 corresponds to the domain of outer communications .    in view of the existence of the timelike curvature singularity @xmath66 ` inside ' the black hole ( thought of here as a singular boundary of the black hole region ) and its unstable behaviour , we are only interested in studying the wave equation in the domain of outer communications * including the horizon * @xmath2 .",
    "note that the study of the horizon is of fundamental importance .",
    "the horizon determines the existence of the black hole and therefore any attempt to prove the nonlinear stability of the exterior of black holes must come to terms with the structure of the horizon .",

    "this result is not satisfactory since it provides no information about the behaviour of waves on the horizon ( which is the boundary of the black hole ) and so it is not sufficient for non - linear stability problems .",
    "it turns out that even proving uniform boundedness of @xmath10 requires a strong result such as integrated decay .",

    "the degeneracy at the photon sphere is expected in view of trapping . in particular , as we shall see , such an estimate degenerates only with respect to the derivatives tangential to the photon sphere .",
    "this degeneracy can be overcome at the expense of commuting with @xmath14 .",
    "the degeneracy at @xmath2 is due to the lack of redshift and can be overcome by commuting with ( the non killing ) vector field @xmath132 and by imposing conditions on the spherical decomposition of @xmath10 ( see section [ sec : commutingwithavectorfieldtransversaltomathcalh ] ) . in section [ sec : conservationlawsondegenerateeventhorizons ] we will see that these conditions are necessary . the degeneracy at infinity will be dropped in section [ sec : energydecay ] where we will use a vector field more adapted to the neighbourhoods of @xmath25 ( which do not contain @xmath351 .",
    "our approach for obtaining the above estimate is by first deriving the weighted @xmath23 estimate for @xmath10 and then for the derivatives .",
