    "in particular , we exploit the fact that identifying synapses in em can be used to generate a _",
    "synapse point cloud _ that is the high - resolution analogue to the nc82 label of bruchpilot ( brp ) , a synaptic protein @xcite .",
    "synapse prediction reveals high - level neuropil structure not always evident from inspection of lower magnification em data .",
    "synapse prediction from em data offers moreover advantages over nc82 immunolabeled data , because the accuracy of synapse density across neuropil regions can be verified by inspecting the high resolution em data .",
    "our primary contribution lies in using synapse point clouds to instantly identify the boundaries of a neuropil in em with great accuracy .",
    "this contribution leads to three applications :    1 .   defining accurately regions of interest ( rois ) .",
    "having accurate rois is crucial to reconstruct connectomes because an imprecisely defined roi leads either to unnecessary , costly manual effort or an incomplete result .",
    "2 .   registration of em synapse point cloud to light microscopy ( lm ) data to facilitate neuropil identification and exploit information annotated in the lm datasets especially in standard brain atlases @xcite .",

    "we have studied the organization and synapse density of the _ drosophila _ antennal lobe ( al ) .",
    "several light microscopic have previously classified the glomeruli @xcite , neuropil compartments , in the al , but the exact number has been uncertain .",
    "glomeruli vary greatly in size depending on sex , sub - species , experience , and so on .",
    "this variation has confounded efforts to demarcate and classify the glomeruli precisely . while ideal comparisons control for genotype , experience level , etc , the size , shape , and locations of glomeruli can vary greatly and non - uniformly between _ in vivo _ and _ in vitro _",
    "preparations , as a result of shrinkage and other disruptions from dissection @xcite .",
    "inspection of the em data alone is insufficient to discern the boundaries between neighboring glomeruli ( figure [ fig : alunclear ] ) . while the glia on the boundaries are often visible , it is often difficult to untangle these accurately from the rest of the neuropil , and as a result their locations fail to arbitrate the boarders between glomeruli .",
    "by contrast , application of our synapse prediction in the al provides synapse point clouds of around 500,000 points that clearly reveal neuropil boundaries .",
    "we show how these clear boundaries lead to precise rois that could significantly reduce manual annotation effort .",
    "furthermore , we successfully clustered this point cloud and were able to classify prominent glomeruli consistent with lm data . a reasonable registration between lm and em synapse point clouds in such a variable neuropil provides some evidence that these techniques will generalize to other regions in the _ drosophila _ brain .",

    "we will first introduce our new methods .",
    "then we will show results from applying synapse prediction to the al , where this information is used to identify neuropil compartments and help define a roi to better concentrate proofreading efforts .",
    "we conclude by discussing applications of these methods .",
    "figure [ fig : flow ] provides an overview of the methods introduced in this paper and the applications of those methods .",
    "in particular , it highlights our strategy for exploiting scalable , automatic synapse prediction .",
    "we use images acquired by fib - sem techniques @xcite to produce a large isotropic dataset .",
    "the isotropic resolution improves image alignment and , generally , the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms @xcite , which is critical when analyzing very large datasets @xcite .",
    "we then produce synapse predictions following the procedure outlined in @xcite . to apply this approach to a very large dataset , both the training required for the classifier and",
    "the prediction algorithm must scale to handle very large datasets .",
    "fortunately , the approach in @xcite has shown itself to be effective with only a small amount of training .",
    "we later show results in which the prediction generalizes over the entire antennal lobe in _",
    "drosophila_. however , in practice , one might need to generate training for each distinct neuropil region .",
    "the main computational bottleneck in @xcite lies in computing the probability that each voxel belongs to a synapse .",
    "this step is distributed across a compute cluster with each local worker processing a small spatial subvolume of the entire region .",
    "* roi and synapse methodology . *",
    "the light blue boxes show the parts of our methods .",
    "the green clouds indicate potential applications explored in this paper.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the application of synapse prediction produces a _ synapse point cloud_. unlike algorithms that automatically extract neuron shapes from em , in which small automatic errors can exert considerable impact on the connectome @xcite , we conjecture that small inaccuracies in the synapse point cloud will have only a minimal effect on our ability to analyze high - level trends .",
    "given the resolution of em data , these predictions can be sampled and accurate synapse counts for different regions can be provided , which is generally difficult using nc82 immunolabeling .",
    "we also suggest the potential for using these predictions as hints for image segmentation algorithms",
    ".    * synapse density maps . *",
    "we apply a gaussian point spread function ( psf ) to the synapse point cloud to generate a smooth map of synapse density .",
    "if the synapse cloud contains @xmath0 points and the center of the @xmath1th point is @xmath2 , the density map is defined as :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is a point in the 3d space and @xmath5 is the normalization factor , which scales the density to cover the full value range for an image of a given bit depth .",
    "the density map has several applications .",
    "for example , the density map resembles the lower resolution data from nc82 light microscopy .",
    "given this , we can register light and em datasets from similar neuropil regions using the techniques introduced in @xcite .",
    "because nc82 and em preparations are different , there will be neuropil variations . despite these variations ,",
    "our results show that we are still able to register prominent neuropil landmarks .",
    "such registration could guide neuronal tracing in em data by using high - level information from light microscopy , although we do not pursue that application in this paper .",
    "the density map also allows us to cluster the image into different neuropil regions through image segmentation .",
    "this is done by resampling the map to produce a 3d digital image that can be directly fed into any image segmentation method .",
    "we perform segmentation using a semi - automated approach .",
    "while clustering with unsupervised approaches like hierarchical - based clustering is sometimes possible when applied directly on a synapse point cloud , we achieved a better clustering result by manually adding seeds to disjoint compartments visible in the density map .",
    "seeded watershed @xcite is then applied on the density map to achieve the final clustering ( thus avoiding the need to laboriously outline the exact boundaries in three dimensions ) . in many cases , subtle changes and discontinuities in the point cloud",
    "are picked up by the automated algorithms , allowing one to see compartment boundaries clearly .",
    "this information can be used to define neuropil regions , as we show later for the antennal lobe .    to obtain good segmentation results ,",
    "the gaussian psf should reveal the gaps between the compartments while making each compartment as smooth as possible . according to the light microscope data ,",
    "the minimal gap size between neighboring compartments is about @xmath6 , which means the maximal value of @xmath7 should be similar . in our implementation , density map resampling resulted in a 3d image with the voxel size @xmath8 along each dimension , which means @xmath9 in pixel units .",
    "we tested two value @xmath10 and @xmath11 and found that @xmath11 performed better for the seeded watershed algorithm used .    * defining rois with point clouds .",
    "* these neuropil clusters can be invaluable for defining rois for em proofreading and used to validate previous boundaries as determined by lm data .",
    "for instance , it is often desirable to answer questions like : what are all of the connections within a specific brain compartment ?",
    "we therefore need ways to annotate which portions in the neuropil are in this region and which not .",
    "because the compartments can not be precisely defined by a simple bounding box , in general , we need a different approach to define the region . to this end",
    ", we introduce a set of algorithms ( described below ) in the package neutu @xcite and dvid @xcite .     * extracting an roi from an em dataset . * a ) tracing algorithm implemented in neutu allows a proofreader to select a large region efficiently using clustered synapse predictions as a guide .",

    "each roi consists of a list of coordinates to these blocks . in this manner",
    ", we can more concisely define an arbitrary region with only a small sacrifice in precision .",
    "the tool neutu enables users to quickly define an roi by drawing _",
    "loops _ in different image planes .",
    "the user can draw the loop as a series of line segments that will snap to the contours , as shown in figure [ fig : roiflow]a .",
    "the contour is chosen as a shortest path through the grayscale data between the two endpoints of the line segment .",
    "the user does not have to draw the roi completely .",
    "neutu will interpolate between loops drawn on non - consecutive planes . using this approach ,",
    "we can precisely and quickly define neuropils .",
    "an roi encompassing the entire al was quickly produced and is shown in figure [ fig : roiflow]b .    as we saw in figure",
    "[ fig : alunclear ] , it is often hard to determine the boundary of the neuropil from the em data alone .",
    "the synapse clusters provide hints for defining compartment boundaries . in section [ sec : roi ] , we show how precise definition of the region produces significant reduction of manual em proofreading effort , the primary bottleneck to scaling connectome reconstruction .",
    "to test our methodology , we analyzed a dataset containing the al of the 3-day old adult , female _",
    "drosophila melanogaster_. the sample was prepared from a 250@xmath14 m frontal head slice of a fly obtained by crossing homozygous w1118 with cs wild type , prefixed for 20 min in 2.5% each of paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde in 0.1 cacodylate buffer , then high - pressure frozen and freeze substituted in 1% oso4 and 0.2% uranyl acetate .",

    ", we made use of a shared cluster resource in which up to 2500 cores were available ( with variations depending on load from other users ) .",
    "the trained classifier was then applied to the entire al , which was about 680 gigavoxels in size .",
    "inference over this full volume took 11 days , and produced approximately @xmath17 t - bar detections .",
    "* generalizability of the synapse classifier over the al . * automated t - bar predictions within 10 randomly chosen subvolumes were manually inspected .",

    "figure [ fig : generalizable ] indicates precision and recall are over 90% for most subvolumes .",
    "however , some outliers exist , which are a result of darker regions in the image volume , as shown in figure [ fig : badpred ] . for example , dark granules in a soma result in several mis - predictions .",
    "a negative result is not surprising since the somata exist at the periphery of the neuropil in the fly brain and were not included in our training dataset .",
    "these generalization errors can potentially be resolved using multiple approaches .",
    "one simple technique is to locally normalize each subvolume , such that the subvolume has 0 mean and unit standard deviation , as a means of compensating for regions where the image has darker intensity .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : normalize ] , the low precision outlier substacks are significantly improved by this normalization , with only a slight average degradation to the rest of the samples .",
    "alternatively , additional training samples could be collected from regions where the original classifier performed poorly , and used to either re - train the classifier , or train a new classifier specific to regions where the original classifier did not generalize well .",

    "( this consistency could also be further improved with more time - consuming , double - checking and consensus - based proofreading but for identification and characterization of strong pathways , this would not in fact be required . )",
    "ultimately , using automatic synapse prediction in a connectome will require more detailed analysis to ensure that subtle biases are not introduced .",
    "we introduce synapse density statistics for the al and several constituent glomeruli .",
    "we enlist the superior resolution of em data to make claims about the accuracy of our approach .",
    "while small inaccuracies in the synapse prediction currently prevent conclusive claims for differences in synaptic density between glomeruli , both our manual annotation and predictions suggest that a synapse packing density exists that is far greater than previously reported using the construct brp - short @xcite .",
    "the authors of this previous report @xcite reveal a consistent packing density of olfactory receptor neuron outputs across several glomeruli in a 10-day adult _ drosophila_.",
    "it is possible that brp - short does not label all synapses , just as nc82 at a dilution used labels only a fraction of the t - bar ribbons in the optic lamina @xcite .",
    "the differences in synaptic counts could also be from al interneurons or projection neurons .",
    "however , specimen differences complicate this comparison ( for instance degeneration at synapses could already be present ) .",
    "future work could strengthen the analysis by generating predictions from multiple samples .",
    "in addition , ongoing semi - automatic reconstruction efforts in the al will eventually reveal the exact distributions of connections per neuron class .",
    "we note that our synapse clouds are closely related to nc82 immunopuncta or other synapse labeled data . for some analyses ,",
    "em synapse point clouds are a preferred alternative , for example when synapse point labels require verification or when subclasses of synapses need to be analyzed .",
    "another consideration is the unknown effectiveness of nc82 in detecting synapses with different compositions and maturities .",
    "brp is localized to the platform of the t - bar @xcite . in some em data",
    ", we note that the platforms are not fully developed .",
    "it is unclear how these t - bars will be labeled in an nc82 sample , whereas , a more detailed analysis could be undertaken in the em data .",
    "anecdotally , we observe that our synapse cloud contains these partial synapse sites .",
    "the biggest obstacle to high - throughput generation of em synapse point clouds is the speed of image acquisition .",
    "synapse prediction requires minimal training and can be computed quickly on a cluster .",
    "continual advances in imaging technology promise to reduce acquisition bottlenecks greatly .",

    "<S> the promise of extracting connectomes and performing useful analysis on large electron microscopy ( em ) datasets has been an elusive dream for many years . </S>",
    "<S> tracing in even the smallest portions of neuropil requires copious human annotation , the rate - limiting step for generating a connectome . while a combination of improved imaging and automatic segmentation will lead to the analysis of increasingly large volumes </S>",

    "<S> unfortunately , small errors in image segmentation can lead to catastrophic distortions of the connectome .    in this paper , to analyze very large datasets , we explore different mechanisms that are less sensitive to errors in automation . </S>",
    "<S> namely , we advocate and deploy extensive synapse detection on the entire antennal lobe ( al ) neuropil in the brain of the fruit fly _ drosophila _ , a region much larger than any densely annotated to date . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting synapse point cloud produced is invaluable for determining compartment boundaries in the al and choosing specific regions for subsequent analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce our methodology in this paper for region selection and show both manual and automatic synapse annotation results . </S>",
