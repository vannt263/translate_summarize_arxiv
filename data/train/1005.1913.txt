    "the issue of nonanalytic corrections to the fermi liquid theory has been studied extensively in recent years .",
    "@xcite the interest to this subject is stimulated by a  variety of topics , from intrinsic instabilities of ferromagnetic quantum phase transitions@xcite to enhancement of the indirect exchange interaction between nuclear spins in semiconductor heterostructures with potential applications in quantum computing.@xcite the origin of the nonanalytic behavior can be traced to an effective long - range interaction of fermions via virtual particle - hole pairs with small energies and with momenta which are either small ( compared to the fermi momentum @xmath9 ) or near @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite in 2d , this interaction leads to a linear scaling of @xmath11 with a characteristic energy scale @xmath12 , set by either the temperature @xmath1 or the magnetic field @xmath13 , or else by the wavenumber of an inhomogeneous magnetic field @xmath14 ( whichever is larger when measured in appropriate units ) . @xcite",
    "higher - order scattering processes in the cooper ( particle - particle ) channel result in additional logarithmic renormalization of the result : at the lowest energies , @xmath15 @xcite the sign of the effect , i.e. , whether @xmath11 increases or decreases with @xmath12 , turns out to be non - universal , at least in a generic fermi liquid regime , i.e. , away from the ferromagnetic instability : while the second - order perturbation theory predicts that @xmath11 increases with @xmath16 the sign of the effect may be reversed either due to a proximity to the kohn - luttinger superconducting instability@xcite or higher - order processes in the particle - hole channel.@xcite    in this paper , we explore the effect of the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) on the nonanalytic behavior of the spin susceptibility .",
    "the soi is important for practically all systems of current interest at low enough energies ; at the same time , the nonanalytic behavior is also an inherently low - energy phenomenon .",
    "a natural question to ask is : what is the interplay between these two low - energy effects ? at first sight , the soi should regularize nonanalyticities at energy scales below the scale set by this coupling .",
    "( for a rashba - type soi , the relevant scale is given by the product @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the coupling constant of the rashba hamiltonian ; here and in the rest of the paper , we set @xmath19 and @xmath20 to unity ) .",
    "indeed , as we have already mentioned , the origin of the nonanalyticity is the long - range effective interaction originating from the singularities in the particle - hole polarization bubble .",
    "if , for instance , the temperature is the largest scale in the problem , these singularities are smeared by the temperature with an ensuing nonanalytic dependence of @xmath11 on @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the zeeman energy @xmath21 is larger than @xmath1 , it provides a more efficient mechanism of regularization of the singularities and , as result , @xmath11 exhibits a nonanalytic dependence on @xmath5 .",
    "the same argument applies also to the @xmath22 dependence .",
    "it is often said that the soi plays the role of an effective magnetic field , which acts on electron spins .",
    "if so , one should expect , for instance , a duality between the @xmath1 and @xmath17 scalings of @xmath0 ( by analogy to a duality between @xmath1 and @xmath23 scalings of @xmath0 ) , i.e. , in a system with fixed soi , the nonanalytic @xmath1 dependence of @xmath11 should saturate at @xmath24 .",
    "the main message of this paper is that such a duality does not , in fact , exist ; more precisely , not all components of the susceptibility tensor exhibit the duality . in particular , the in - plane component of @xmath11 , @xmath25 , continues to scale linearly with @xmath1 and @xmath23 , even if these energies are smaller than @xmath17 . on the other hand , the @xmath1 and @xmath23 dependences of @xmath26",
