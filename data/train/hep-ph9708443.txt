    "the experiments which are taking place at the cern lep ii electron  positron collider will be able to explore the gauge structure of @xmath0 and @xmath1 three  point functions in the @xmath4pair production @xcite . deviations from the standard model ( sm ) predictions for this reaction would indicate the existence of new physics effects .",
    "in general , such deviations can be parametrized in terms of effective lagrangians by adding to the sm lagrangian , high  dimension operators that describe the new phenomena @xcite . this model ",
    "independent approach accounts for new physics that shows up at an energy scale @xmath5 , larger than the electroweak scale .",
    "the effective lagrangians are constructed with the light particle spectrum that exists at low energies , while the heavy degrees of freedom are integrated out .",
    "they are invariant under the @xmath6 and , in the linearly realized version , they involve , in addition to the usual gauge  boson fields , also the light higgs particle .",
    "the most general dimension6 effective lagrangian , containing all sm bosonic fields , that is @xmath7 and @xmath8 even , was constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we explore the consequence of new operators that give rise to anomalous higgs boson couplings , without affecting the self  interaction amongst the gauge bosons .",
    "these anomalous interactions can _ not _ be constraint by the lep ii results on w  pair production .",
    "in particular , we study the reactions @xmath9 and @xmath3 .",
    "these processes do not involve any triple  vector  boson coupling , but only @xmath10 and @xmath11 anomalous higgs interactions . in the sm , neglecting the higgs  electron coupling , there are no higgs contributions to these reactions at tree level since the @xmath10 and @xmath11 couplings are generated only at one ",
    "loop @xcite .    out of the eleven independent operators constructed in ref.@xcite ,",
    "two of them describe new interactions between the higgs particle and the vector bosons , @xmath12 where , in the unitary gauge , the higgs doublet becomes @xmath13^t$ ] , and @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 being the field strength tensors of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 gauge fields respectively .",
    "we should notice that the operators ( [ lagrangian ] ) contribute only to the anomalous higgs couplings , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , since their possible contribution to the self ",
    "boson couplings , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , can be completely absorbed in the redefinition of the sm fields and gauge couplings @xcite .",
    "furthermore , no new @xmath22 or @xmath3 vertices , like the ones studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , are generated via these operators .",
    "therefore , studies of anomalous trilinear gauge boson couplings are insensitive to the coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "anomalous higgs boson couplings have already been studied in higgs and z boson decays @xcite , in @xmath25 @xcite , @xmath26 @xcite , and @xmath27 colliders @xcite . here , in order to impose limits on the dimension6 operators ( [ lagrangian ] ) that generate the new higgs interactions , we examine the total @xmath22 and @xmath3 yield and kinematical distributions of the final state particles at lep ii and at the next linear collider , nlc .",
    "in our analysis of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 reactions , we have taken into account the standard one loop higgs contributions @xcite to these processes . in this way",
    ", the @xmath3 production involves seven ( eight ) standard ( anomalous ) feynman contributions , while in the @xmath22 process there are ten ( twelve ) standard ( anomalous ) diagrams . in order to compute these contributions ,",
    "we have incorporated all anomalous couplings in helas ",
    "type @xcite fortran subroutines .",
    "these new subroutines were used to adapt a madgraph @xcite output to include all the anomalous contributions .",
    "we have checked that our code passed the non  trivial test of electromagnetic gauge invariance .",
    "we investigate the @xmath3 and @xmath22 production both at lep ii and at nlc , assuming a center  of  mass energy of @xmath30 and 500 gev and an integrated luminosity of @xmath31 and 50 fb@xmath32 respectively .",
    "we required that the photon energy , @xmath33 , is larger than 5 gev for lep ii and than 20 gev for nlc .",
    "we applied an isolation cut by requiring that the angle between any two final state particles is larger than @xmath34 .",
    "the same cut was applied to the angle of the bosons with the beam pipe .",
    "our results for the sensitivity of lep ii to the operators appearing in the effective lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) indicate that the reaction @xmath35 can provide limits on both anomalous couplings since @xmath36 fb , and we can expect around 300 events per year .",
    "a 1@xmath37 deviation in the total cross section , assuming a higgs boson with mass of 100 gev , requires that , @xmath38 these results are similar to those arising from the analysis of the reaction @xmath39 @xcite , where a 1@xmath37 deviation implies @xmath40 .    on the other hand , the reaction @xmath41 is almost insensitive to the anomalous coefficient @xmath24 . for a higgs boson mass of @xmath42 gev",
    ", a 1@xmath37 deviation can be observed for @xmath43 tev@xmath44 . the small sm cross section for this process , @xmath45 fb , leads to very few events per year at lep ii , and in consequence , the constraints from this reaction are limited by the poor statistics .    due to the increase on the available phase space , we are able to establish tighter constraints on the coefficients @xmath46 by studying the contribution of the operators ( [ lagrangian ] ) to these same processes at nlc . for instance , at @xmath47 gev , @xmath48 fb , which yields 2900 events per year assuming the expected luminosity for nlc ( @xmath49 fb@xmath32 ) . requiring a maximum deviation of 2@xmath37 in the total cross section , and assuming a higgs boson of 200 gev , we obtain the allowed ranges @xmath50 tev@xmath44 and @xmath51 tev@xmath44 .",
    "unlike at lep ii , at nlc the best constraint on the anomalous couplings come from the reaction @xmath52 , which gives rise to @xmath53 events per year at @xmath47 gev .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows the effect of the anomalous operators ( [ lagrangian ] ) in the total cross section of this reaction .",
    "a 2@xmath37 deviation in the total cross section sets the bounds , @xmath54 also for a 200 gev higgs boson .",
    "furthermore , we can expect the new interactions to affect most the longitudinally polarized gauge bosons production due to the presence of the scalar higgs boson as intermediate state .",
    "we tried to take advantage of this fact by studying the longitudinal @xmath55pair production which brings on a slightly better result , _",
    "@xmath56 tev@xmath44 and @xmath57 tev@xmath44 for a 2@xmath37 effect .",
    "unfortunately the improvement is very small because the requirement of polarized @xmath55 reduces by two orders of magnitude the total yield .",
    "we have also investigated different distributions of the final state particles in order to search for kinematical cuts that could improve the nlc sensitivity .",
    "the most promising variable is the photon transverse momentum which distribution is presented in fig .  [ fig:2 ] for the unpolarized case .",
    "we observe that the contribution of the anomalous couplings is larger in the high @xmath58 region .",
    "therefore a cut of @xmath59 gev drastically reduces the background .",
    "the improvement on @xmath46 bounds can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] where a 1 , 2 , and 3@xmath37 deviations in the total cross section is shown before and after the above cut is applied .",
    "the contribution of the anomalous couplings is dominated by on  mass  shell higgs production with the subsequent @xmath60 decay .",
    "the peak around @xmath61 gev in the photon transverse momentum distribution is due to the monochromatic photon with @xmath62 which is emitted in association with the 200 gev higgs boson .",
    "therefore the best constraints are obtained at nlc for higgs boson masses in the range @xmath63 gev , where a on  shell production is allowed .",
    "we present in table [ tab:1 ] the limits on the coefficients @xmath24 and @xmath23 based on a @xmath64 deviation in the total cross section for a higgs mass in the range @xmath65 gev .",
    "table [ tab:2 ] shows the same limits after the cut in the photon transverse momentum distribution of @xmath59 gev is implemented .",
    "these results are comparable to the limits for @xmath24 and @xmath23 obtained from the study of the reaction @xmath39 presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , suggesting that the processes considered here can be used as a complementary tool in the study of anomalous higgs interactions .    in conclusion , the search for the effect of higher dimensional operators that give rise to anomalous higgs boson couplings may provide important information on physics beyond the standard model and should be pursued in all possible reactions .",
    "we have studied here the triple vector boson production , @xmath22 and @xmath3 , in @xmath25 colliders focusing on the operators that generate only anomalous higgs boson couplings and can not be tested in the @xmath4pair production .",
    "we established the limits that can be imposed at lep ii and nlc through the analysis of the deviations on the total cross section .",
    "furthermore , we used the photon transverse momentum spectrum and polarization of the @xmath55 s to improve these constraints to few tev@xmath44 at the nlc .",
