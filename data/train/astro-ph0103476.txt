    "the merger hypothesis @xcite assumes that elliptical galaxies form by major mergers of spiral galaxies .",
    "this is supported by observations of nearby merging systems that seem to evolve into systems with properties comparable to elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "the gravitational interaction during the merger process also triggers massive star formation and , probably , the formation of massive central black holes and agns @xcite . on the theoretical side , numerous numerical simulations have shown that mergers lead to spheroidal systems with global properties comparable to elliptical galaxies @xcite . during the merging epoch the galaxies are far from dynamical equilibrium .",
    "gas , if added to the simulations , condenses into stars by massive bursts of star formation during the merging process or effectively looses angular momentum and falls into the central parts of the merger remnant , probably feeding a central black hole @xcite .",
    "when the merger remnants have settled into dynamical equilibrium , phase mixing and violent relaxation have erased most information about the initial conditions . however , as violent relaxation is incomplete , the stellar phase space distribution of elliptical galaxies should still show fine structure which affects the isophotal shapes and velocity distributions .",
    "this fine structure provides fundamental insight into the formation epoch of elliptical galaxies .",
    "numerical simulations of collisionless mergers of disk galaxies have confirmed this conclusion .",
    "the losvds of merger remnants and the orbit structure of their stars contain information about the initial disk orientations @xcite .",
    "the isophotal shapes and the dynamics of the merger remnants are primarily determined by their initial mass ratios @xcite .",
    "in this letter we show that the losvds of most elliptical galaxies contain evidence for a second disk component with roughly 10% to 20% the luminosity of the spheroid and a large scale radius which if is order the effective radius of the spheroid .",
    "this disk might have formed by late gas infall from gas - rich progenitors , followed by star formation .",
    "observationally , photometric and kinematic investigations of elliptical galaxies have already indicated the existence of large stellar disks of the same order of magnitude as predicted here , especially in disky , rotating ellipticals @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that this component is required in almost all ellipticals , independent of whether they are disky or boxy in order to bring the observations in agreement with the merger scenario of the formation of early - type galaxies .",
    "we use the method described by @xcite to construct disk galaxies in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "the system of units is : gravitational constant g=1 , exponential scale length of the larger disk in the merger h=1 and mass of the larger disk @xmath1 .",
    "the disks are exponential with an additional spherical , non - rotating bulge with mass @xmath2 , a hernquist density profile @xcite and a scale length @xmath3 .",
    "the system lives in a spherical pseudo - isothermal halo with a mass @xmath4 , cut - off radius @xmath5 and core radius @xmath6 .",
    "the n - body simulations were performed using a direct summation code with the new special purpose hardware grape-5 @xcite .",
    "the 1:1 merger was calculated adopting in total 400000 particles with each galaxy consisting of 60000 disk particles , 20000 disk particles and 120000 halo particles . for the 3:1 merger the parameters of the more massive galaxy were as described above .",
    "the low - mass galaxy contained 1/3 the mass and number of particles of the larger galaxy , with a disk scale length of @xmath7 , as expected from the tully - fisher relation .    for both mass ratios , the galaxies approached each other on nearly parabolic orbits with an initial separation of 30 length units and a pericenter distance of 2 length units . in this letter",
    "we focus on one corotating and one counterrotating geometry .",
    "we have found that these two impact parameters are representative for a much larger set of simulations that have been performed and that will be discussed in a subsequent paper .",
    "the inclinations of the corotating disk models ( called model a for the equal mass merger and model c for the 3:1 merger ) relative to the orbital plane are @xmath8 and @xmath9 with arguments of pericenter of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the counterrotating disks ( called model b for 1:1 and model d for 3:1 ) have @xmath8 and @xmath12 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively . in all simulations the merger remnants were allowed to settle into dynamical equilibrium for approximately 10 dynamical timescales after the merger was complete .",
    "then their equilibrium state was analysed .",
    "to measure the line - of - sight velocity distribution of a merger remnant we shifted the densest region of every two - dimensional projection to the origin .",
    "then we placed a slit with a width of 0.2 unit lengths along the apparent long axis of each projected remnant .",
    "thereafter we binned all particles falling within each grid cell in velocity along the line - of - sight .",
    "the grid spacing was chosen to be 0.15 times the projected half - mass radius .",
    "the width of the velocity bins was set to a value of 0.2 for line - of - sight velocities @xmath13 in the range @xmath14 .",
    "this results in 80 velocity bins over the whole velocity interval . using the binned velocity data we constructed line - of - sight velocity profiles ( losvd ) for each bin along the grid .",
    "subsequently we parametrized deviations from the gaussian shape of the velocity profile using gauss - hermite basis functions @xcite .",
    "the kinematic parameters of each profile ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) were then determined by least squares fitting .",
    "the large number of simulated stellar particles ( @xmath19 100000 ) guaranteed that at least 2000 particles fall within each slit inside one effective radius .",
    "the straight lines in figure 1 indicate the observed local correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath20 for a sample of elliptical galaxies in low density environments , published by @xcite . in all cases @xmath17 and @xmath20 have opposite signs .",
    "the data indicate that all elliptical galaxies have losvds with steep prograde wings and broad retrograde wings . @xcite",
    "have shown that this result also holds for cluster ellipticals in coma .    the local correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath20 for the simulated corotating ( a",
    ", c ) and counterrotating ( b , d ) 1:1 and 3:1 mergers , respectively , is shown by the dots in figure 1 .",
    "every remnant is analysed as seen from 50 random viewing angles . for the corotating mergers",
    "the correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath20 is almost opposite to the observed one .",
    "this is also reflected in a positive effective value for @xmath17 ( left plot in figure 2 ) for almost all projection angles , where @xmath21 is defined as the mean value between 0.25 and 0.75 effective radii @xcite . here",
    ", a positive @xmath21 corresponds to an anticorrelation between @xmath17 and @xmath20 , such that @xmath22 for @xmath23 and vice versa .",
    "we find that @xmath21 versus @xmath24 does not follow the observed correlation , indicated by the solid and dashed lines .",
    "the profiles have broad prograde wings and narrow retrograde wings . the counterrotating 3:1 merger ( d ) in fig .",
    "1 shows a large spread around zero but also does not agree with observations .",
    "the only exception is the equal mass merger of counter - rotating disks ( b ) which leads to a very anisotropic elliptical with no signature of rotation .",
    "note , that the four simulations which we focus on in this paper have been chosen because they are representative for a much larger set of simulations with different orbital geometries .",
    "these four models have been recalculated with high resolution for better statistics .",
    "we conclude that collisionless mergers of disk galaxies in general fail to explain the detailed kinematics of all observed elliptical galaxies ( also massive , boxy ones ) that exhibit a significant amount of rotation ( @xmath25 ) inside one @xmath26 .",
    "further evidence for a possible failure of the collisionless merger picture comes from @xcite who showed that the kinematical properties of very faint and fast rotating , disky elliptical galaxies can not be explained by collisionless mergers of disk galaxies .",
    "one plausible explanation for line - of - sight velocity distributions with negative @xmath17 is the superposition of a spheroidal body with a disk - like component @xcite . with a simple experiment one can test if the wrong correlations found in our remnants result from a lack of such a component .",
    "we artificially added a thin ( scale height @xmath27 ) , cold ( velocity dispersion perpendicular to the disk @xmath28 ) , stellar disk with an exponential surface density profile .",
    "the disk was placed in the plane defined by the long and intermediate axes of the main stellar body , rotating in the same direction as the main stellar body .",
    "the particles of the disk were assumed to move around the center of the galaxy in centrifugal equilibrium with the gravitational potential arising from the total enclosed mass .",
    "no additional random motion was added . under these simple assumptions",
    "only two parameters remain free : the total mass of the disk @xmath29 in units of the total luminous mass of the remnant and its scale length @xmath30 in units of the projected half - light radius @xmath26 .",
    "the results for the corotating 3:1 remnant ( c ) are summarized in the figures 3 and 4 .",
    "this case is representative for all our unequal mass merger remnants . in general",
    ", we find that disks with small masses or radii do not change the losvds of the stellar component .",
    "disks with masses and radii in the region indicated by the black dots in figure 4 , on the other hand , lead to a significant change in the resulting line profile .",
    "the prograde wings become steeper than the retrograde ones in very good agreement with observations .",
    "this effect is shown in figure 3 for a disk with 15% of the spheroid mass and @xmath31 .",
    "the influence on the @xmath21 versus @xmath24 correlation and its dependence on projection effects is shown on the right hand side of figure 2 .",
    "now the values fall in the observed regime .",
    "if the additional disk becomes too massive , the absolute values for @xmath17 are larger than observed and the surface brightness profiles change from de vaucouleurs to exponential profiles which is again not in agreement with observations .",
    "we therefore conclude that the existence of an additional stellar disk component with 10% to 20% the luminosity of the spheroid and a scale length of the order of @xmath26 can explain the observed correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath20 in elliptical galaxies .",
    "our simulations indicate that models of pure collisionless mergers in general fail to reproduce losvds of observed elliptical galaxies .",
    "all simulated profiles locally have the wrong sign of @xmath17 with respect to @xmath32 , compared with the observations .",
    "a similar result has been reported by @xcite .",
    "they , however , did not investigate projection effects .",
    "a detailed investigation of local properties of the losvds and projection effects shows that the presence of an additional stellar disk component added to the stellar body after the merger is complete could solve the problem .    one possible origin for such a disk is gas that must have been present during the formation epoch of massive ellipticals and that formed a disk after the major merger event",
    "was completed . in order to fit the observed profiles ,",
    "the amount of gas that settled into the equatorial plane must have been significant .",
    "it is puzzling why the gas did not turn into stars prior to its infall into the equatorial plane and how the gas could keep its angular momentum required for the disk to have a scale length equal to the effective radius of the spheroid .",
    "@xcite do find gaseous disk - like components in their equal mass merger models .",
    "tidal torques lead however to efficient angular momentum loss in the gaseous component resulting in gas infall to the center .",
    "only 20% of the initial gas mass ( which was 10% of the initial disk mass ) and by this less than 2% of the stellar mass settled into an extended disk - like component . in this case",
    "the disk would not be massive enough to change the losvd of the system significantly .",
    "equal mass mergers of very gas rich disks ( more than 50% gas ) could , however , lead to the formation of more massive disk - like components in the end .    first simulations by @xcite have shown that for unequal mass mergers of gas rich galaxies which lead to disky , fast rotating ellipticals due to the stronger centrifugal support , a large fraction of the gas settles into extended disks after the merger is complete , if star formation is suppressed . this seems to be an attractive scenario to explain the existence of large disks in disky elliptical galaxies .",
    "the origin of large stellar disks in massive boxy ellipticals with a small but significant amount of rotation that form presumably from equal - mass mergers is , however , still unclear ."
