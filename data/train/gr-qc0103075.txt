    "before embarking on a quest to discover the cosmic gravitational - wave background ( cgb ) , it is worth reflecting on how much has been learned from its electromagnetic analog , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the recent boomerang@xcite and maxima@xcite experiments have furnished detailed pictures of the universe some 300,000 years after the big bang .",
    "these measurements of the cmb anisotropies have been used to infer that the visible universe is , to a good approximation , spatially flat .",
    "the earlier cobe - dmr@xcite measurements of the cmb anisotropy fixed the scale for the density perturbations that formed the large scale structure we see today , and showed that the density perturbations have an almost scale free spectrum .",
    "with all this excitement over the anisotropy measurements it is easy to forget how much the cmb taught us before the anisotropies were detected .",
    "the initial observation that the cmb is highly _ isotropic _ is one of the major observational triumphs of the big bang theory .",
    "equally important was the discovery by cobe - firas@xcite that the cmb has an exquisite black body spectrum with a temperature of 2.728 kelvin .",
    "the lesson that we take from the cmb is that while it would be wonderful to have a cobe style map of the early universe in gravitational waves , a great deal can be learned by detecting the isotropic component .",
    "the main focus of this work is on the fixing the amplitude of the cgb at some frequency .",
    "some attention will also be given to the prospects of measuring the the energy spectrum .",
    "detecting anisotropies in the cgb is a considerably harder problem that we address elsewhere@xcite .",
    "there are two major obstacles that stand in the way of detecting the cgb .",
    "the first is the extreme weakness of the signal , and the second is the competing stochastic background produced by astrophysical sources .",
    "figure 1 shows various predictions for the cgb energy spectra in several early universe scenarios including standard inflation , a particular m - theory model@xcite and quintessence based inflation@xcite .",
    "also shown is the sensitivity curve for the proposed laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa)@xcite , and a compilation of possible extragalactic astrophysical foregrounds taken from the work of schneider _ et al._@xcite . the spectrum is expressed in terms of @xmath0 , the energy density in gravitational waves ( in units of the critical density ) per logarithmic frequency interval , multiplied by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 .",
    "the predictions for the cgb power spectra are fairly optimistic , and some of them come close to saturating existing indirect bounds on @xmath0  see the review by maggiore for details@xcite .    with the exception of the m - theory motivated model , we see that the major obstacle to detecting the cgb is not the sensitivity of our detectors , but competition from astrophysical foregrounds .",
    "the astrophysical foregrounds are produced by the combination of a great number of weak sources that add together to form a significant stochastic signal .",
    "based on current estimates , it is thought that the contribution from astrophysical sources falls off fairly rapidly below 1 @xmath4hz .",
    "for that reason , we will focus our attention on detecting the cgb in the sub - micro hertz regime . to put this number into perspective ,",
    "an interferometer built using lisa technology would need spacecraft separated by one - tenth of a light year to reach a peak sensitivity at 1 @xmath4hz ! a more practical approach is to use two smaller interferometers that lack the intrinsic sensitivity to detect the cgb on their own , but together are able to reach the necessary sensitivity . the idea is to cross correlate the outputs from the two interferometers and integrate over some long observation time @xmath5 .",
    "since the noise in the two interferometers is uncorrelated while the signal is correlated , the signal to noise ratio will steadily improve as the observation time is increased .    in principle , it is possible to detect an arbitrarily weak signal by observing for an arbitrarily long time . in practice ,",
    "the prospects are not so rosy as the sensitivity of the detector pair only improves on the sensitivity of a single detector as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the frequency bandpass . the frequency bandpass is typically taken to equal the central observing frequency .",
    "suppose we try and look for the cgb at a frequency of @xmath8  hz using the two ligo detectors .",
    "over an observation time of @xmath9 year , the sensitivity is improved by a factor of @xmath10 by cross correlating the washington and louisiana detectors . for a pair of lisa detectors with a bandpass of @xmath11  hz , cross correlating for a year would result in a 500 fold improvement in sensitivity . however , for detectors operating in the @xmath4hz range , cross correlating two detectors for one year only improves on the sensitivity of a single detector by a factor of @xmath12 .",
    "so why use two interferometers when one will do ?",
    "the reason is simple : with a single interferometer it is not possible to tell the difference between the cgb and instrument noise since both are , to a good approximation , stationary gaussian random processes .",
    "moreover , it is impossible to shield a detector from gravitational waves in order to establish the noise floor . with two or more independent interferometers",
    "the cross correlated signal can be used to seperate the stochastic bacground from instrument noise .",
    "the lisa system has three arms , and the signal from these arms can be used to form three different michelson interferometers .",
    "however , these interferometers share spacecraft , and thus common sources of noise , so nothing is gained by cross correlating the outputs .",
    "however , tinto _",
    "et al._@xcite have recently suggested another way of combining the signals , known as a sagnac system , that creates an interferometer that is fairly insensitive to gravitational waves .",
    "since the response of this `` bad '' interferometer is noise dominated , its output can be used to estimate the noise floor for the standard interferometer configuration .",
    "thus , a single lisa type observatory might be able to discriminate between the cgb and instrument noise .",
    "we will show that cross correlating two lisa interferometers results in a signal to noise ratio of @xmath13 for a scale invariant stochastic gravitational wave background .",
    "this represents a five hundred fold improvement over the sensitivity of a single lisa interferometer .",
    "if it were not for the astrophysical foregrounds that are thought to dominate the cgb signal in the lisa band , a pair of lisa detectors would stand a good chance of detecting the cgb . in an effort to avoid being swamped by astrophysical sources , we focus our efforts on detecting the cgb below 1 @xmath4hz .",
    "we show that a pair of interferometers can reach a signal to noise of @xmath14 for a scale invariant cgb spectrum .",
    "the above result is scaled against a possible lisa follow - on mission ( lisa ii ) that calls for two identical interferometers , comprising six equally spaced spacecraft that form two equilateral triangles overlayed in a star pattern .",
    "the constellations follow circular orbits about the sun in a common plane at a radius of 1 au , so that each interferometer arm is @xmath15 au in length .",
    "the acceleration noise , @xmath16 , is scaled against a value that improves on the lisa specifications by one order of magnitude .",
    "the lisa ii design could detect a stochastic background at 99% confidence with one year of observations if @xmath17 .",
    "ideally we would like to reach a sensitivity of at least @xmath18 in order to detect inflationary spectra with a mild negative tilt .",
    "it is difficult to achieve this with spacecraft orbiting at 1 au as thermal fluctuations due to solar heating of the spacecraft make it hard to reduce the acceleration noise below @xmath19 .",
    "the best strategy is to increase the size of the orbit , @xmath20 , as this increases the size of the interferometer , @xmath21 , and decreases the thermal noise by @xmath22 .",
    "we begin by deriving the response of a pair of cross correlated space - based laser interferometers to a stochastic background of gravitational waves .",
    "similar calculations have been done for ground based detectors@xcite , but these omit the high frequency transfer functions that play an important role in space based systems . our calculations closely follow those of allen and romano@xcite , and reduce to theirs in the low frequency limit , where @xmath23 is the length of one interferometer arm . ] .",
    "many of the calculational details that we omit for brevity can be found in their paper .",
    "having established the general formalism for cross correlating space based interferometers we use our results to identify some promising configurations for a gravitational background interferometer ( gabi ) mission to detect the cgb .",
    "we attack the problem of cross correlating two space based interferometers in stages .",
    "we begin by reviewing how the doppler tracking of a pair of spacecraft can be used to detect gravitational waves . using this result",
    "we derive the response of a two arm michelson interferometer and express the result in a convenient coordinate - free form .",
    "the response of a single interferometer is then used to find the sensitivity that can be achieved by cross correlating two space based interferometers .      following the treatment of hellings@xcite , we consider two free spacecraft , one at the origin of a coordinate system and the other a distance @xmath23 away at an angle @xmath24 from the @xmath25 axis .",
    "both spacecraft are at rest in this coordinate system .",
    "the spacecraft at the origin sends out a series of photons , while a weak plane gravitational wave is passing through space in the @xmath26 direction . to leading order ,",
    "the spacetime metric in the transverse - traceless gauge is : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the wave amplitude and @xmath29 is the angle between the principal polarization vector and the @xmath30 axis .",
    "if we choose our coordinates such that the second spacecraft is in the @xmath31 plane , the path of the photons can be parameterized by @xmath32 the photon path in the perturbed spacetime is given by @xmath33 , or @xmath34 the round trip journey from spacecraft 1 to spacecraft 2 and back again is given by @xmath35d\\rho \\right .",

    "the transfer function can be ignored since instrument noise keeps the operational range below ligo s transfer frequency of @xmath61 hz ( not to mention that ligo is a fabry - perot interferometer so our results do not really apply@xcite ) . for a space based detector such as lisa ,",
    "the instrument noise does not rise appreciably at high frequencies , and it is the transfer function that limits the high frequency response .",
    "the sinc function is responsible for the wiggly rise in the lisa sensitivity curve at high frequency that can be seen in figure 4 .",
    "we can form an interferometer by introducing a third spacecraft at a distance @xmath23 from the corner spacecraft and differencing the outputs of the two arms .",
    "the measured strain is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the detector response tensor and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are unit vectors in the direction of each interferometer arm , directed out from the vertex of the interferometer .",

    "the contribution to the snr from a clean frequency window of this sort is given by @xmath187 the integrand is approximately equal to @xmath188 for all frequencies , so that @xmath189 this expression provides a useful lower bound for the snr that can be achieved for detectors with a clean frequency window of width @xmath7 centered at some frequency @xmath66 .",
    "for example , the spectral density due to white dwarf binaries in our galaxy is expected to exceed lisa s noise spectral density for frequencies in the range @xmath190 hz . to detect this background at 90% confidence",

    "one possible modification to the current lisa proposal@xcite would be to fly six spacecraft instead of three , and thereby form two independent interferometers .",
    "the cost of doing this is considerably less than twice the cost of the current proposal , and it has the advantage of providing additional redundancy to the mission . how would we best use a pair of lisa interferometers ? if our main concern is getting better positional information on bright astrophysical sources , then we would fly the two interferometers far apart , _ eg . _ with one leading and the other trailing the earth",
    ". however , if we want to maximize the cross correlation then we need the interferometers to be coincident and coaligned",
    ". however , a configuration of this type is likely to share correlated noise sources , which would defeat the purpose of cross correlating the interferometers .",
    "a better choice is to use a configuration that is coaligned but not coincident .",
    "this can be done by placing six spacecraft at the corners of a regular hexagon as shown in figure 5 .",
    "notice that interferometers have parallel arms and that the corner spacecraft are separated by the diameter of the circle .",
    "using the same coordinate system that we used earlier for a single interferometer , the unit vectors @xmath191 and @xmath192 along each interferometer arm are : @xmath193 where the index @xmath194 labels the two interferometers .",

    "the light crossing time between the two interferometers , @xmath197 , is almost equal to the light crossing time along each interferometer arm , @xmath198 .",
    "thus , the loss of sensitivity due to multiple wavelengths fitting between the interferometers occurs for frequencies near the transfer frequency @xmath199 ( the transfer frequency corresponds to wavelengths that fit inside the interferometer arms ) . for lisa",
    "the transfer frequency is @xmath200 hz .

    "indeed , if it were not for the astrophysical foregrounds , a pair of lisa detectors would be well poised to detect a scale invariant gravitational wave background from inflation .",
    "we will work on the assumption that astrophysical foregrounds swamp the cgb for frequencies above a few @xmath4hz , and design our missions accordingly .",
    "what we have in mind is a post - lisa mission based on the ( by then ) tried and tested lisa technology , but with some allowance for improvements in basic technologies such as the accelerometers .",
    "since cross - correlating two interferometers at ultra - low frequencies does not buy us a major improvement in sensitivity , we need to start with a design that has excellent sensitivity at low frequencies .",

    "we show the sensitivity curves for three generations of lisa missions in figure 7 .",
    "lisa i corresponds to the current lisa design with the spacecraft cart - wheeling about the sun at 1 au , separated by @xmath206 m. lisa ii refers to a possible follow on mission with the three spacecraft evenly spaced around an orbit at 1 au , so that the spacecraft are separated by @xmath207 au .",

    "to lisa i ( same laser power and telescope size ) , but allows for an order of magnitude improvement in accelerometer performance .",
    "lisa iii is similar to lisa ii , except that the constellation would orbit at 35 au ( between neptune and pluto ) and the accelerometers would be improved by a further two orders of magnitude .",
    "the acceleration noise for lisa iii would benefit from the three orders of magnitude reduction in solar radiation relative to lisas i and ii ,",
    "but this would come at the cost of having to power the spacecraft using nuclear generators ( rtgs ) .",
    "for all three missions we see that the @xmath4hz range lies well below the interferometer s transfer frequency @xmath216 indeed , it would take a mission orbiting at 180 au ( somewhere inside the kuiper belt ) to achieve a transfer frequency of @xmath217 hz . in practical terms this allows us to work in the low frequency limit @xmath58 where it is easy to derive analytic expressions for the overlap reduction function @xmath157 .",
    "moreover , we need only consider acceleration noise when working below 1@xmath4hz .",
    "all our calculations are based on the same hexagonal cross correlation shown in figure 5 that we used for the lisa i cross correlation . using equation ( [ accel ] ) for the acceleration noise and ignoring the position noise yields @xmath218 in the limit that the noise power dominates the spectral density of the cgb we arrive at an estimate for the signal to noise ratio for frequencies below 1@xmath4hz @xmath219 the snr",
    "is scaled against the lisa ii specifications . since @xmath220",
    "it is a good approximation to set @xmath221 inside the integral .",
    "we model the cgb spectrum near 1@xmath4hz by a simple power law : @xmath222 scaled relative to a reference value at 1@xmath4hz . with these approximations",
    "we arrive at our final expression for the snr for a pair of cross correlated interferometers in the ultra low frequency regime : @xmath223 we can compare this to the snr of a single interferometer in the ultra low frequency regime by combining equations ( [ ogw ] ) , ( [ snrf ] ) and ( [ an ] ) to find @xmath224 we see that the individual and cross correlated sensitivities are related : @xmath225 this supports our earlier assertion that cross correlating two interferometers improves on the sensitivity of a single interferometer by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is approximately equal to the central observing frequency @xmath66 .",
    "equation ( [ snr ] ) tells us that a gabi detector built from two lisa ii interferometers could detect the cgb at greater than 90% confidence with one year of data taking if @xmath226 .",
    "the same equation also tells us what has to be done to achieve greater sensitivity .",
    "it is clear that increasing the duration of the mission is not the best answer as the snr only improves as the square root of the observation time .",
    "in contrast , increasing the size of the interferometer or reducing the acceleration noise produces a quadratic increase in sensitivity . for example , a gabi detector built from a pair of lisa iii interferometers could detect the cgb at 90% confidence for signals as small as @xmath227 . in - fact",
    ", for signal strengths above this value the lisa iii detectors are signal dominated and we need to use equation ( [ sigdom ] ) instead of ( [ snr ] ) to calculate the snr .    we can also use equation ( [ snr ] ) to determine how well a gabi mission can measure the cgb power spectrum .",
    "suppose that we break up the frequency spectrum into bins of width @xmath228 .",
    "nyquist s theorem tells us that @xmath229 , _ eg . _ for an observation time of one year the frequency resolution is @xmath230 hz . writing @xmath231 where @xmath232 , and taking @xmath233 , we find from ( [ snr ] ) that in the frequency window @xmath234 the snr is @xmath235 we see that the snr in each frequency bin scales as @xmath236 . for a scale invariant spectrum ( @xmath237 )",
    "this translates into poor performance at frequencies below 1 @xmath4hz and limits the range over which we can measure the spectrum .",
    "for example , if the cgb has a scale invariant spectrum and an amplitude of @xmath238 , a pair of lisa ii interferometers could measure the spectrum over the range @xmath239 hz . for a pair of lisa iii detectors the main limitation at low frequencies comes from nyquist s theorem .",
    "since mission lifetimes are limited to tens of years , it will not be possible to measure the cgb spectrum much below @xmath240 hz using space based interferometers .",
    "indeed , it may be difficult to push much below @xmath241 hz unless ways can be found to build detectors that are stable for many months .",
    "a pair of lisa iii interferometers could measure the spectrum between @xmath242 hz if @xmath243 . to measure the cgb spectrum below @xmath240 hz",
    "requires a return , full circle , to the world of cmb physics .",
    "detailed polarization measurements of the cmb can be used to infer@xcite the cgb power spectrum for frequencies in the range @xmath244 hz .",
    "the lisa follow - on missions we have described will be able to detect or place stringent bounds on the cgb amplitude and spectrum between @xmath240 and @xmath245 hz . but how can we be sure that it is the cgb we have detected and not some unresolved astrophysical foreground ?",
    "the answer can be found in the statistical character of the competing signals .",
    "most early universe theories predict that the cgb is truly stochastic .",
    "in contrast , the astrophysical signal is only approximately stochastic , in a sense that can be made precise by appealing to the central limit theorem .",
    "the line in figure 1 indicating the predicted amplitude of various astrophysical foregrounds corresponds to what is known as the confusion limit .",
    "it marks the amplitude at which we can expect to find , on average , one source per frequency bin hz in width . ] .",
    "it is not until we reach signal strengths considerably smaller than the confusion limit that the astrophysical signal starts to look stochastic . and therein lies the answer to our question .",
    "a `` stochastic '' signal due to astrophysical sources will always have bright outliers that sit just above the amplitude of the stochastic signal .",
    "the number and distribution of the outliers can be predicted on statistical grounds .",
    "if we do not see the outliers , then we can safely conclude that we have detected the cgb .",
    "we thank peter bender and raffaella schneider for sharing their thoughts on possible astrophysical sources of gravitational waves .",
