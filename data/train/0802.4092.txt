    "a galvanomagnetic property of fundamental interest in thin manganite films is their isothermal magnetoresistance(mr ) measured as a function of the angle(@xmath0 ) between current @xmath4 and applied magnetic field @xmath5 , both in the plane of the film .",
    "this angle - dependent resistivity(@xmath16 ) in polycrystalline films of metallic ferromagnets follows a dependence of the type@xcite ; @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the resistivities for @xmath13 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "the resistivity @xmath16 , often called the rotational magnetoresistance ( rmr ) , derives contribution from two carrier scattering processes one of which depends crucially on the spin - orbit interaction ; a magnetization(@xmath6 ) direction and strength dependent source of anisotropic scattering . while @xmath6 may not be necessarily collinear with @xmath5 due to non - zero magnetocrystalline anisotropy , a grain averaging of @xmath21 in a polycrystalline film yields equation [ eqrho ]",
    "this contribution to rmr , which has been known as anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) , saturates once the field intensity h exceeds the saturation value h@xmath22 beyond which the film becomes a single domain magnetic entity .",
    "another contribution to rmr comes from the trapping of mobile carriers in cyclotron orbits due to the lorentz force .",
    "this localizing effect ( a positive contribution to mr ) , which increases with the carrier mean free path is called the orbital magnetoresistance ( omr ) .",
    "the magnitude of omr varies as square of the magnetic induction @xmath23 , and shows a constant positive slope for @xmath24 .",
    "while the @xmath19 is always greater than @xmath18 for omr , the relative magnitude @xmath25 of these resistivities can be greater or less then unity for amr .",
    "the sign of the inequality between @xmath19 and @xmath18 is intimately linked with the electronic band structure of the material under consideration . in",
    "most of the @xmath26 - transition metal alloys @xmath27 and the magnetoresistance @xmath28 can be as large as @xmath29 in some dilute ni alloys@xcite . in low carrier density ferromagnets such as the hole doped manganites@xcite , gamnas@xcite and gdn@xcite the anisotropic magnetoresistance is small and negative",
    ".    the angular dependence of resistivity as expressed by equation [ eqrho ] , does not hold in the case of single crystal samples with a non - zero magnetocrystalline anisotropy . here",
    "the magnetization is not necessarily collinear with @xmath5 because its direction is decided by the competition between the torques exerted on it by @xmath5 and the crystalline anisotropy field .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath21 at low fields , in particular when the torque on @xmath6 is not strong enough to depin it from the easy axis , may deviate markedly from the behavior predicted by equation [ eqrho ] . often , the @xmath21 vs @xmath0 curve has sharp jumps and hysteresis suggesting a first order transition .",
    "such magnetization reorientation phase transition ( mrpt ) has been seen prominently in fe film grown on gaas@xcite .",
    "it is evident that measurements and analysis of the galvanomagnetic property rmr as a function of field strength and temperature provide rich insight into spin - orbit interaction , carrier mobilities , scattering length and the torques experienced by @xmath6 from the applied field @xmath5 , and various forms of magnetic anisotropies which pin @xmath6 along a certain crystallographic direction .",
    "extensive literature exists on the phenomena of amr , rmr and omr on polycrystalline samples of ferromagnets like fe , ni and their alloys@xcite .",
    "there are also a large number of studies on epitaxial thin film of iron in which the deviations from a @xmath30 dependence have been addressed in terms of magnetocrystalline anisotropy@xcite .",
    "extension of the ideas used to understand rmr in elemental ferromagnets to complex ferromagnetic oxides of poorly understood magnetocrystalline anisotropy , nature of charge carriers , their scattering mechanism and their coupling to lattice and spin degrees of freedom poses major challenges .",
    "one family of complex metallic oxides which has drawn considerable interest in recent years is of manganites of the type a@xmath31b@xmath32mno@xmath33 where a is a rare earth and b an alkaline earth ion .",
    "electrical conduction in these systems is primarily through @xmath34-electrons hopping between neighboring manganese sites@xcite .",
    "understanding the mechanism of rmr in these systems is of fundamental importance .",
    "most of the studies reported till date on anisotropy of magnetoresistance in manganites have been carried out on epitaxial films of the average bandwidth compound la@xmath31ca@xmath32mno@xmath33 ( lcmo , x@xmath350.3 ) deposited on [ 100 ] cut srtio@xmath33 .",
    "these ferromagnetic films have in - plane magnetization with [ 001 ] as the magnetic easy axis and the magnetic ordering temperature of @xmath35270 k. for example , measurements of odonnell et al@xcite show a striking anisotropy and hysteresis in the low - field mr for @xmath36 and @xmath37 configurations , which they attribute to magnetocrystalline anisotropy and colossal magentoresistance .",
    "ziese and sena@xcite , and ziese@xcite have also measured the low - field resistance anisotropy for @xmath36 and @xmath37 configurations in lcmo films at several temperatures .",
    "while the sign and magnitude of their amr are consistent with the phenomenological @xmath38 scattering model of malozemoff@xcite , its temperature dependence needs interpretation .",
    "infante et al@xcite have measured the isothermal mr as a function of the angle @xmath0 between @xmath4 and @xmath5 at 180 k in [ 110 ] oriented lcmo epitaxial films .",
    "they attribute the hysteretic angular dependence of mr seen at low field to in - plane uniaxial anisotropy of these films .",
    "hong and coworkers@xcite have investigated the effect of injected charges , using a field effect geometry , on amr of [ 100 ] oriented epitaxial la@xmath39sr@xmath40mno@xmath33 films in order to separate the contributions of carrier concentration and disorder caused by chemical doping to amr . while these and other@xcite studies provide a wealth of information on resistance anisotropy in colossal magnetoresistance manganites , the issues which have remained unaddressed are ;    1 .",
    "although it is evident from low field measurements of odonnell et al.@xcite on [ 100 ] lcmo and infante and coworkers@xcite on [ 110 ] lsmo films that there is indeed a non - zero in - plane anisotropy which pins the magnetization vector along the easy axis , the h - t phase space of the pinned phase is not established in these studies .",
    "moreover , the relative strength of the in - plane anisotropy , which is directed along different crystallographic axes for the [ 100 ] and [ 110 ] films , is not known .",
    "there is also a need to understand the fundamental processes responsible for the anisotropy .",
    "2 .   at larger fields ,",
    "the magnetization rotates freely with the field .",
    "a systematic temperature dependence of @xmath16 which would allow calculation of @xmath41 is , however , lacking . a comparative study of @xmath42 and its temperature dependence in [ 100 ] and [ 110 ] films would help in separating the band structure related contribution and the role of extrinsic effects such as disorder to anisotropic magnetoresistance .",
    "3 .   while polycrystalline films of @xmath26 ferromagnets show a simple @xmath30 dependence of isothermal mr , in single crystals this is generally not true . here",
    "the orientation of both current and magnetization with respect to crystal axis is important . in the case of manganites",
    "a full fledged analysis of @xmath43 in terms of dring s equations@xcite is lacking .",
    "such a study is desired to establish significant deviations from the @xmath30 dependence of @xmath42 and the contributions of other scattering processes to rmr .    here",
    "we present a rigorous study of rmr in two variants of high quality epitaxial films of la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath3 one with [ 001 ] and other with [ 110 ] axis normal to the plane of the substrate .",
    "we have analysed the data in the light of dring s equations @xcite .",
    "the field and temperature dependence of the phenomenological coefficients between a selected range of temperature has also been reported for both types of film .",
    "we have also drawn the h - t phase diagram for both films to show the pinned and depinned regions in the h - t phase space .",
    "the phase diagram clearly shows that in case of [ 110 ] film the pinning of the magnetization vector is stronger than that of [ 001 ] film .",
    "thin epitaxial films of la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath3 were deposited on [ 110 ] and [ 001 ] oriented srtio@xmath33 ( sto ) substrates using a multitarget pulsed excimer laser [ krf , @xmath44 = 248 nm ] ablation technique . the deposition temperature ( t@xmath45 ) , oxygen partial pressure p@xmath46 , laser energy density ( e@xmath45 ) and growth rate ( g@xmath47 ) used for the growth of 150 nm thick layers were , 750@xmath48 c , 0.4 mbar , @xmath492j/@xmath50 and 1.3 / sec respectively .",
    "further details of film deposition are given elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the epitaxial growth in two sets of films with [ 110 ] and [ 001 ] directions normal to the plane of the film was established with x - ray diffraction measurements performed in the @xmath51 geometry .",
    "we have also examined the surface topography of these epitaxial films using high resolution scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) and atomic force microscopy ( afm ) techniques .",
    "the measurements revealed prominent grainyness at nanometer length scale . in the case of [ 001 ] films , the grains were circular of average diameter @xmath52 nm , while for the [ 110 ] films rectangular grains of area @xmath5370 nm x 40 nm were seen . however",
    ", the long edge of the rectangles did not have a preferred orientation .",
    "these isotropic features of the surface texture suggest that the microstructure of these films can not contribute to in - plane magnetic anisotropy . for transport measurements ,",
    "films were patterned in the form of a @xmath54 bridge with photolithography and wet etching such that the long axis of the bridge was parallel to [ 001 ] and [ 100 ] direction for the [ 110 ] and [ 001 ] oriented films respectively .",
    "the measurements of resistivity as a function of temperature , magnetic field strength and the angle@xmath55 between the field and current were performed using a 4.2k close cycle he - refrigerator with a fully automated home made setup for applying the field at varying angles between 0 and 2@xmath56 with respect to the direction of current@xcite .",
    "the sample was mounted in a way to keep the field in the plane of the sample for all values of the angle between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "isothermal magnetization loops ( m - h ) were measured for both the samples using a commercial magnetometer ( quantum design mpms xl5 squid ) by applying the field at various angles in the plane of the film .",
    "figure [ mhloop ] shows the magnetization vs field ( m - h ) loops for the [ 110 ] and [ 001 ] epitaxial samples at 10k in terms of the normalized magnetization m(h)/m@xmath22 , where m@xmath22 is the saturation magnetization .",
    "the absolute value of m@xmath22 at 10k for [ 110 ] and [ 100 ] film is approximately 475 and 400 emu/@xmath57 respectively .",
    "these numbers have @xmath58 error due to uncertainty in the measurement of film area and thickness .",
    "the magnetic field in these measurements was applied along the easy axis which is collinear with the [ 001 ] and [ 110 ] crystallographic axis for the [ 110 ] and [ 001 ] epitaxial films respectively@xcite .",
    "the coercive fields for the [ 110 ] and [ 001 ] samples deduced from these measurements are 230 oe and 90 oe respectively .",
    "the marginally higher h@xmath59 of the [ 110 ] film seen here appears to be a common feature of such films@xcite .",
    "the rmr of a [ 110 ] oriented lsmo film at 300 and 10k is shown in figure [ amr110300k ] and figure [ amr11010k ] respectively , where we have plotted the angle ( @xmath0 ) between the directions of current and applied field along the x - axis and the resistance ratio r(@xmath0)/r(0 ) along the y - axis .",
    "the relevant vectors in the plane of the film are also shown in the right hand inset of the figures .",
    "for the measurements performed at 300k ( figure [ amr110300k ] ) , we observe a symmetric r(@xmath0)/r(0 ) curve about @xmath60 and @xmath61 with a periodicity of @xmath56 when the external field h is @xmath62 300 oe . below 300 oe however , there is a distinct deviation from this symmetry ; the peak in resistance is now shifted to @xmath63 .",
    "the variation of the peak position as a function of field is plotted in the left inset of the figure .",
    "one noticeable feature of the low field ( @xmath64 300 oe ) data is a sudden drop in resistance once the peak value is reached .",
    "this suggests some kind of a depinning transition .",
    "for the r(@xmath0)/r(0 ) vs @xmath0 curves at 10k ( figure [ amr11010k ] ) this deviation from the symmetric dependence persist upto @xmath531100 oe . here we also note that at fields below 200 oe , the resistance has a negligible dependence on the angle between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "one more noteworthy feature of these data is the value of resistance for @xmath13 and @xmath12 configuration . unlike the case of 3@xmath34 transition metal films , here @xmath65",
    "this is an interesting feature of the rmr in manganite thin films@xcite .    in figures [ amr100300k ] and [ amr10010k ]",
    "we have shown the rmr of the [ 001 ] oriented lsmo film at 300 and 10k respectively .",
    "for the measurements at 300k ( figure [ amr100300k ] ) we observe a symmetric angular dependence of the normalized resistance @xmath66 for all values of the applied field , even at fields as low as 75 oe . at 10k however(figure [ amr10010k ] ) , the @xmath66 deviates from the symmetric behavior when the field is reduced below @xmath35 500 oe . a sharp drop in resistance when the angle @xmath0 is increased beyond @xmath67 for these low field measurements is a remarkable feature of these data .",
    "this abrupt drop in resistivity is accompanied by a hysteresis in the @xmath66 vs @xmath0 plots when the angle is traced back from @xmath68 to 0 .",
    "a typical hysteresis is shown in figure [ amrhyst ] .",
    "the area under the hysteresis loop decreases with the field . in the left inset of figs .",
    "[ amr110300k ] , [ amr11010k ] , [ amr100300k ] and [ amr10010k ] we have plotted the @xmath67 as a function of magnetic field strength . as noted from these insets , the peak in rmr deviates rapidly from @xmath60 as the magnetic field is lowered below a critical value h*. we have tracked the variation of h * with temperature between 10 and 120k for the two types of films by measuring @xmath16 at several fields while the temperature is held constant .",
    "the result of such a measurements is shown in figure [ phaseamr ] .",
    "the discontinuous change in @xmath16 below a characteristic field h * and accompanying hysteresis indicate the existence of a magnetization reorientation phase transition ( mrpt)@xcite in the system driven by the torque of @xmath5 field on @xmath6 . while a rigorous analysis of the mrpt carried out by minimizing the magnetization free energy functional allows the calculation of the in - plane magnetocrystalline anisotropies",
    ", here we simply argue that the line in figure [ phaseamr ] separates the h - t phase space where the magnetization is pinned along the easy axis and where it is free to rotate with the field .",
    "it is clear from figure [ phaseamr ] that the magnetization in [ 110 ] oriented film remains pinned along the easy axis over much larger h - t phase space campared to the [ 001 ] oriented film .",
    "the issue of why the magnetic easy axis in [ 001 ] and [ 110 ] films of manganites is different with a different degree of anisotropy energy as suggested by the phase diagram of figure [ phaseamr ] has not been addressed in detail although several workers have reported a difference in in - plane anisotropy axis of [ 001 ] and [ 110 ] lsmo films@xcite .",
    "it is generally agreed that while for the [ 001 ] films the easy axis of magnetization is along [ 110 ] direction , the [ 110 ] films have uniaxial anisotropy with easy and hard directions along [ 001 ] and @xmath69 $ ] respectively . in some earlier studies the magnetic anisotropy in thin lsmo films has been attributed to epitaxial strain@xcite .",
    "berndt etal.@xcite have shown that for [ 001 ] films the anisotropy is dependent on magnetocrystalline effect while for [ 110 ] film it is determined by magnetoelastic effect .",
    "similarly , tsui etal.@xcite have concluded that the anisotropy of lsmo films is sensitive to symmetry and morphology of substrate but lattice strains can induce an additional anisotropy along the direction of tensile strain .",
    "our group has recently reported@xcite dramatic effects of epitaxial strain in magnetic and transport properties of la@xmath31sr@xmath70mno@xmath3 ( x=0.55 ) epitaxial film .",
    "however , the effects diminish and bulk - like behavior is seen once the film thickness exceeds @xmath71 nm . since in present case",
    "the films are 150 nm thick , it is safe to assume that the strain induced by lattice mismatch between film and substrate is completely relaxed .",
    "lattice parameter of the films inferred from x - ray diffraction measurement support the conclusion(@xmath72 } = 3.855$] , @xmath73 } = 3.85$] and @xmath74 ) .",
    "since the topography shows circular and randomly oriented rectangular grains and x - ray diffraction yields a bulk - like lattice parameter , it can be concluded safely that the magnetic anisotropy of [ 001 ] and [ 110 ] films is not an artifact of strain .",
    "however , we expect a fundamental contribution of the orientation of mn - o - mn bonds to magnetic anisotropy . in figure [ schematic ]",
    "we sketch the atomic arrangement on the top layer of the [ 001 ] and [ 110 ] cut srtio@xmath33 crystals and the way epitaxial registry is maintained when la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath3 film grows on the top .",
    "we can see that in the case of [ 001 ] oriented film the mn - o - mn bonds are directed along the [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] direction making them energetically degenerate . to avoid this degeneracy",
    "the magnetization vectors prefer to lie along the [ 110 ] direction making it the easy axis .",
    "the difference in the energy of the [ 110 ] and [ 100]/[010 ] states of magnetization is expected to be small .",
    "this is perhaps the reason why the depinning field in this case is substantially lower . in the case of the [ 110 ] oriented films , the mn - o - mn bond , with a length of @xmath35 3.89 ,",
    "is directed along the [ 001 ] direction , whereas along the @xmath69 $ ] direction the two mn ions are separated by @xmath35 5.5 without any bridging oxygen .",
    "this makes the [ 001 ] direction the preferred direction for orientation of the magnetization vector .",
    "furthermore , as the [ 001 ] and @xmath69 $ ] directions are highly inequivalent , the pinning of @xmath6 along [ 001 ] is expected to be robust , which is really the case seen in the phase diagram of figure [ phaseamr ] .      in figure [ amrper ]",
    "we plot the percentage rmr defined as @xmath75 $ ] at 10 and 300k for the two types of films as a function of field .",
    "the rmr is negative in both the cases .",
    "for the [ 001 ] film at 300k , it is also nearly constant at all fields . for the same film at 10k the magnitude of rmr first increases rapidly with field and",
    "then acquires a saturation value of @xmath76 at h @xmath77 1 koe . for the [",
    "110 ] film the rmr at 300k saturates to @xmath78 at h @xmath79 koe .",
    "the same film has the rmr of @xmath80 at 10k .",
    "it is somewhat surprising to note that the rmr of the [ 110 ] film decreases while for [ 001 ] it increases as we go down in temperature .    in order to address this issue further , we have measured the 2500 oe rmr of these films at several temperatures between 10 and 120k .",
    "these data are shown in figure [ rmrvartemp ] .",
    "we note that the rmr of both the samples is negative and its amplitude in the [ 001 ] case decreases monotonically as the temperature is raised to 120k .",
    "in fact the rmr deduced from @xmath81 and @xmath82 measured between 120 and 240k shows that this drop continues till 240k .",
    "for the [ 110 ] sample however , the magnitude of rmr first increases with temperature till t @xmath53 200k and then drops on increasing the temperature further .",
    "in the one band model of malozemoff@xcite as applied to manganites by ziese and sena@xcite , the amr is given as ; @xmath83,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the spin - orbit coupling constant , @xmath84 the crystal field splitting and @xmath85 the exchange field . by putting in the value of @xmath85 , @xmath84 and @xmath44 for a typical double exchange manganite",
    "they find that @xmath86 in the limit of zero temperature . while a precise temperature dependence of the parameters @xmath87 and @xmath44 is not known , in manganites of @xmath88k a significant enhancement in amr near the curie temperature ( t@xmath59 ) has been observed .",
    "herranz etal.@xcite have argued that as the curie temperature is approached , the double exchange mechanism is impeded by the enhanced jahn - teller distortion of mn - o octahedron with concomitant unquenching of the orbital angular momentum which enhances the spin - orbit interaction and hence the amr .",
    "our data , however , suggest that in these high quality films of la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath3 where t@xmath59 is @xmath53 360k , the amr decreases on warming to 300k .",
    "while we have not been able to measure the amr at t @xmath77 300k due to experimental limitations , this is an important issue that needs to be addressed in future .",
    "a rigorous analysis of the rmr data of our samples needs to be done using the approach of dring@xcite which entails writing the magnetoresistance of a cubic ferromagnet as a series in magnetization and current direction cosines @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively as @xcite , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the resistivity at t = 0 , @xmath93 s are phenomenological constants , @xmath94 is a numerical constant depending on the easy axis direction , and @xmath95 .",
    "for the situation when magnetic domains are distributed equally among the easy axes in zero applied field .",
    "the constant c is 1/4 for [ 110 ] easy axis and zero for [ 100 ] easy axis@xcite . for the purpose of our [ 110 ] films ,",
    "the analysis is similar to that used by gorkom etal @xcite for [ 110 ] fe with [ 001 ] easy axis . following this work ,",
    "we can write @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , where @xmath8 is the angle between the magnetization and the [ 001 ] axis and @xmath100 , the angle between the electrical current @xmath4 and the [ 001 ] direction . a sketch of three vectors @xmath6 , @xmath4 and the unit vector @xmath101 pointing along the easy axis in a most generalized situation is given at the bottom of figure [ fit110 ] .",
    "on substituting these parameters in equation [ doringeq ] one gets , @xmath102 in our case @xmath103 hence @xmath104 .",
    "this result leads to @xmath105 .",
    "since @xmath106 depends only on @xmath107 and @xmath108 which in turn are temperature dependent coefficients , we can lump @xmath106 in @xmath109 for an isothermal measurement , and then , the right hand side of equation [ eqnfin110 ] can be written as @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the resistance at the peak position .",
    "we have used equation [ eqnfin110 ] to fit rmr data for [ 110 ] sample at 10 and 300k , which were presented earlier in figure [ amr110300k ] and figure [ amr11010k ] respectively in a compact form .",
    "the quality of fit is shown for a representative set of data in figure [ fit110 ] .",
    "while we see a reasonably good fit to equation [ eqnfin110 ] down to @xmath53 873 oe , the angular dependence at still lower fields is characterized by a sharp drop in @xmath21 at @xmath63 due to mrpt as discussed earlier . for the 10k data ,",
    "the quality of the fit is poor even at high fields ( @xmath112 ) and it worsens when the field is reduced below 1574 oe .",
    "figure [ const110 ] shows the variation of various fitting parameters with field at 10 and 300k . in both the cases , the parameter c3 and c4 stays close to zero",
    "this result is remarkable as it validates the fitting , because we already know @xmath113 and @xmath114 are zero for our geometry ( @xmath103 & @xmath104 ) .",
    "we also note that the ratio of the quadratic ( @xmath115 ) and quadruplet ( @xmath116 ) coefficients remains same at 300k in the field range of @xmath49 800 to @xmath49 2700 oe . at lower temperature",
    ", however , the term appearing in 4@xmath117 power of @xmath118 remains constant where as the magnitude of the quadratic term increases with field . in figure [ const110temp ]",
    "we have traced the variation of these coefficients with temperature between 10 and 120k at an applied field of 2.5 koe . while c3 and c4 stays close to zero for all temperatures , the absolute value c1 and c2 increases with temperature . before we discuss the significance of these coefficients ( c s ) , it is pertinent to discuss the angle dependent data for the [ 001 ] epitaxial films .    for the [ 001 ] film ,",
    "the easy axis is along [ 110 ] where as the current is along [ 100 ] direction .",

    "the final expression for the resistivity in this case is ; @xmath128 in this case @xmath129 and @xmath130 where @xmath0 is the angle between applied field and current direction",
    ". a sketch of three vectors @xmath6 , @xmath4 and the unit vector @xmath101 pointing along the easy axis in a most generalized situation is given at the bottom of figure [ fit100 ] .",
    "since @xmath129 , it turns out that in this case @xmath131 . here",
    "we have assumed @xmath132 , where @xmath111 is the resistance when the field is aligned along [ 110 ] the easy axis . in figure [ fit100 ]",
    "we have shown the fit of equation [ eqnfin100 ] to rmr data for [ 001 ] sample at 10 and 300k .",
    "it is evident that at 300k the model ( equation [ eqnfin100 ] ) correctly describes the behavior of the rmr down to fields as low as @xmath53 275 oe . at still lower fields although the deviations become large , the peak and valleys of the data are correctly reproduced .",
    "the situation , however , is quite different at 10k ; here even at high fields deviation from the model are evident near the maxima .",
    "we now discuss the behavior of the coefficients @xmath133 and @xmath134 whose variation as a function of field is shown in figure [ const100 ] .",

    "we also conclude that the [ 110 ] films have higher anisotropy energy then the films with [ 001 ] orientation .",
    "this becomes clear from the fact that at 300k as well as at 10k the coherent rotation of magnetization with applied field which results in @xmath138 dependence of rmr appears at much higher fields for [ 110 ] films then for [ 001 ] films .",
    "secondly , a look at the amr percentages calculated from these data shows that for the [ 110 ] films the absolute value of amr increase with temperature while it is opposite for the [ 001 ] films .",
    "we believe that the magnetization vector of the [ 110 ] films at low temperature is strongly pinned along the easy axis due to the large anisotropy energy . at higher temperatures ,",
    "the thermal energy @xmath141 helps in depinning and free rotation of @xmath6 along with the external field @xmath5 .",
    "this leads to enhanced rmr at higher temperatures .",
    "of course , if the field strength is increased further , free rotation would become possible at 10k as well .",
    "the required fields , however , may be well beyond what has been used in these experiments .",
    "a direct support to this argument come from the non - saturating trend of 10k amr of the [ 110 ] film as a function of field ( figure [ amrper ] ) .",
    "a very interesting picture emerges from the value of constants so calculated . while for the [ 110 ] film the rmr is mostly dependent on even powers of @xmath118 , the dependence of the rmr for the [ 001 ] films is predominantly @xmath135 where @xmath8 is the angle between applied field and easy axis of film .",
    "a qualitative explanation for this observation can be given if we refer to figure [ schematic ] where the direction of mn - o - mn bond of the [ 001 ] sto surface is shown . as we have stated earlier ,",
    "the [ 110 ] direction is the easy axis because of the degeneracy of [ 010 ] and [ 100 ] directions in zero field .",
    "an external field applied at 45@xmath142 with respect to the [ 110 ] direction lifts this degeneracy , which perhaps is the reason why mr has a strong contribution from the @xmath135 term with its maximum at @xmath143 .    a discussion on the temperature and angular dependence of rmr would remain incomplete unless we address the role of electron localization in cyclotron orbits .",
    "the orbital magnetoresistance resulting due to electron trapping is given as@xcite , @xmath144 in the limit @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the relaxation time and b@xmath10 the component of magnetic induction perpendicular to current i. it is expected to be negligible when carrier mean free path l is much shorter than its cyclotron orbit ( r@xmath59 ) . with the known hole density ( @xmath147/m@xmath148 ) , and fermi energy ( 1.8ev)@xcite of lsmo and 10k resistivity and magnetic induction b(=h+4@xmath56 m ) of the [ 001 ] film , which are 0.11 m@xmath149-cm and 7500 g for [ 001 ] films respectively we obtain @xmath150 and @xmath151 . similarly for the [ 110 ] film , the l and r@xmath59 are @xmath152 and @xmath153 respectively . from these numbers it can be concluded that omr will make negligible contribution to rmr in these films .",
    "following gorkom@xcite , the angular dependence of omr can be written as;@xmath154 where @xmath155 and @xmath156 is the resistivity at t = 300k . using the @xmath157 and @xmath158 data for [ 001 ] film and equation [ rhoomr ] we obtain @xmath159 and @xmath160 which is much too small compared to measured rmr . from this analysis",
    "it can be concluded that the origin of angular magnetoresistance is these films is spin - orbit coupling dependent amr effect .",
    "we have carried out a comparative study of the isothermal magnetoresistance of [ 001 ] and [ 110]epitaxial la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath3 films as a function of the angle between current and coplanar magnetic field at several temperatures between 10 and 300k .",
    "the magnetic easy axis of the [ 001 ] and [ 110 ] films is along [ 110 ] and [ 001 ] directions respectively . in view of the similar texture of these two types of films , which can otherwise contribute to shape anisotropy",
    ", we conclude that the easy axis is fundamentally related to the orientation of mn - o - mn bonds on the plane of the substrate .",
    "the isothermal resistance @xmath19 and @xmath18 for @xmath20 and @xmath13 configurations respectively of these two type of films obeys the inequality @xmath65 for all fields and temperatures .",
    "however , the @xmath16 shows deviation from the simple @xmath30 dependence at low fields due to pinning of the magnetization vector @xmath6 along the easy axis .",
    "this effect manifests itself as a discontinuity in @xmath16 at @xmath161 and a concomitant hysteresis on reversing the angular scan .",
    "we establish a magnetization reorientation phase transition in this system and extract the h - t phase space where @xmath6 remains pinned . a robust pinning of magnetization seen in [ 110 ]",
    "films suggests strong in - plane anisotropy as compared to the [ 001 ] films .",
    "we have carried out a full fledged analysis of the rotational magnetoresistance of the two types of epitaxial lsmo films in the frame work of the dring theory@xcite of anisotropic magnetoresistance in metallic ferromagnet single crystals .",
    "we note that strong deviation from the predicted angular dependence exist in the irreversible regime of magnetization .",
    "a simple estimation of orbital mr in these films suggest that the rmr is dominated by spin - orbit interaction dependent anisotropic magnetoresistance .",
