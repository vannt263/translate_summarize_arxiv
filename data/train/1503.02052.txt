    "luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs : with an 8 - 1000  @xmath12 ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) , including ultra - luminous ones ( ulirgs , @xmath13 ) , dominate the cosmic star formation ( sf ) at @xmath14 ( e.g. , le flch et al .",
    "2005 ) . for @xmath15",
    "to 3 , these galaxies are mixtures of two populations based on their prevalent `` sf mode '' : ( a ) mergers dominated by nuclear starburst with warm far - infrared ( fir ) colors and a high sf efficiency ( sfe ) similar to that in local ulirgs , and ( b ) gas - rich disk galaxies with disk sf and sfe comparable to local spirals ( e.g. , daddi et al .",
    "2010 ) ; more ulirgs belong to the latter `` main - sequence '' ( ms ) population ( e.g. , elbaz et al .",
    "however , the current perception that the typical spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the dust emission in the high-@xmath11 , ms galaxy population is merely a `` scaled - up '' sed of local normal galaxies remains unproven : if the size of the effective sf region in a galaxy is fixed , an increasing  implies a higher effective sfr surface density ( @xmath16 ) , which is known to lead to a warmer 60-to-100  color , @xmath4 , ( thus , the shape of the sed ) for both normal galaxies and ( u)lirgs ( chanial et al .  2007 ; liu et al .  2015 ; also see  3.2 ) . as demonstrated by rujopakarn et al .",

    ", @xmath4 probes the average intensity of the dust heating radiation field ( e.g. , draine & li 2007 ) , and both sfr and @xmath4 should be measured in order to more fully characterize the sf activity in galaxies .",
    "the conventional way to do so is to obtain a full dust sed from which both the sfr ( from ) and @xmath4 can be deduced . for high-@xmath11 galaxies ,",
    "this usually requires multiple photometric measurements covering a wide wavelength range , as illustrated in the recent studies on 3 galaxies at @xmath17 - 6 ( riechers et al .",

    "2014 ; rawle et al .",
    "2014 ) . furthermore",
    ", as @xmath11 increases , accurate continuum photometry becomes tougher due to relatively bright background .",

    "this is usually attributed to a more severe co dissociation by uv photons because of a lower dust opacity .",
    "nevertheless , the mid-@xmath18 co line emission arises from dense molecular clouds ; possible uv self - shielding ( lee et al .",
    "1996 ) implies that co(7@xmath16)/ir should not be as severely dependent on metallicity as co(1 - 0)/ir . in fig .  1 ,",

    "<S> to better characterize the global star formation ( sf ) activity in a galaxy , one needs to know not only the star formation rate ( sfr ) but also the rest - frame , far - infrared ( fir ) color ( e.g. , the 60-to-100   color , @xmath0 of the dust emission . the latter probes the average intensity of the dust heating radiation field and scales statistically with the effective sfr surface density in star - forming galaxies including ( ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies [ ( u)lirgs ] . </S>",
    "<S> to this end , we exploit here a new spectroscopic approach involving only two emission lines : co(7@xmath16 ) at 372  and  at 205   ( ) . for local ( u)lirgs , the ratios of the co(7@xmath16 ) luminosity ( @xmath2 ) to the total infrared luminosity (; </S>",
    "<S> 8@xmath11000 ) are fairly tightly distributed ( to within @xmath30.12 dex ) and show _ little _ dependence on @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this makes @xmath2 a good sfr tracer , which is less contaminated by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) than  and may also be much less sensitive to metallicity than @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the logarithmic /co(7@xmath16 ) luminosity ratio is fairly steeply ( at a slope of @xmath3@xmath6 ) correlated with @xmath4 , with a modest scatter ( @xmath30.23 dex ) . </S>",
    "<S> this makes it a useful estimator on @xmath4 with an implied uncertainty of @xmath30.15 [ or @xmath74k in the dust temperature ( @xmath8 ) in the case of a graybody emission with @xmath9k and a dust emissivity index @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> our locally calibrated sfr and @xmath4 estimators are shown to be consistent with the published data of ( u)lirgs of @xmath11 up to @xmath36.5 . </S>"
