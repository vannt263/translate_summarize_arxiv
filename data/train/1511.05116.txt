    "over the past two decades , a wide set of cosmological observations @xcite have allowed us to summarize our understanding of the basic properties of the universe in the concordance cosmological model , known as the @xmath8cdm model . despite providing a good fit to the observational data",
    ", the model presents some puzzles as most of the content of the universe is in the form of _ dark _ components , namely dark matter and dark energy , whose nature is still mysterious .    in this framework ,",
    "cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) lensing science has emerged , in the last several years , as a new promising cosmological probe @xcite .",
    "the large - scale structure ( lss ) leaves an imprint on cmb anisotropies by gravitationally deflecting cmb photons during their journey from the last - scattering surface to us @xcite .",
    "the net effect is a remapping of the cmb observables , dependent on the gravitational potential integrated along the line - of - sight ( los ) .",
    "thus the effect is sensitive to both the geometry of the universe and to the growth of the large - scale structure .",
    "lensing also introduces non - gaussian features in the cmb anisotropy pattern which can be exploited to get information on the intervening mass distribution @xcite , which in turn may give hints on the early stages of cosmic acceleration @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "since cmb lensing is an integrated quantity , it does not provide direct information on the _ evolution _ of the large scale gravitational potential .",
    "however , the cross - correlation between cmb lensing maps and tracers of large - scale structure enables the reconstruction of the dynamics and of the spatial distribution of the gravitational potential , providing simultaneous constraints on cosmological and astrophysical parameters @xcite , such as the bias factor @xmath1 relating fluctuations in luminous and dark matter .    in the standard structure formation scenario galaxies",
    "reside in dark matter halos @xcite the most massive of which are the signposts of larger scale structures that act as lenses for cmb photons .",
    "bright sub - mm selected galaxies , that are thought to be the progenitors of present - day massive spheroidal galaxies , are excellent tracers of large - scale structure and thus optimally suited for cross - correlation studies .    even more importantly , the sub - millimeter ( sub - mm ) flux density of certain sources remains approximately constant with increasing redshift for @xmath10 ( strongly negative k - correction ) , so that sub - mm surveys have the power of piercing the distant universe up to @xmath114 where the cmb lensing is most sensitive to matter fluctuations .",
    "in contrast , the available large ",
    "area optical / near - infrared galaxy surveys and radio source surveys reach redshifts only slightly above unity and therefore pick up only a minor fraction of the cmb lensing signal whose contribution peaks at @xmath12 and is substantial up to much higher redshifts .",
    "quasars allow us to extend investigations much further , but are rare and therefore provide a sparse sampling of the large - scale gravitational field .",
    "previous cross - correlation studies involving cmb lensing and galaxy or quasar density maps have been reported by many authors @xcite .    as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "the cmb lensing kernel is well - matched with the one of the unresolved dusty galaxies comprising the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) since both are tracers of the large - scale density fluctuations in the universe . in particular , planck measurements suggest that the correlation between the cmb lensing map and the cib map at 545 ghz can be as high as @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "other statistically significant detections have been recently reported by @xcite .",
    "even though there are connections between these studies and the one presented here , one needs to bear in mind that , differently from galaxy catalogs , the cib is an integrated quantity and as such it prevents a detailed investigation of the temporal evolution of the signal .",
    "moreover , the interpretation of the measured cross - correlation is actually more challenging since the precise redshift distribution of the sources contributing to the sub - mm background is still debated .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the angular cross - power spectrum @xmath14 between the cmb convergence derived from _ planck _ data and the spatial distribution of high-@xmath15 sub - mm galaxies detected by the _",
