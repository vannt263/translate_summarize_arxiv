    "a 4@xmath13 black hole is coincident with the compact nonthermal radio source sgr  a@xmath0  at the center of the galaxy ( ghez 2008 ; gillessen 2009 ; reid and brunthaler 2004 ) . the estimated mass accretion rate onto sgr a * is several orders of magnitude smaller than the rate at which young , windy stars in the innermost 0.5 pc supply mass to the bondi radius of sgr a * ( coker & melia 1997 ; cuadra 2006 , 2008 ) .",
    "@xmath14 observations have characterized the x - ray emission surrounding sgr  a@xmath0  to be spatially extended with a radius of @xmath151.5   ( baganoff 2003 ; wang 2013 ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is interpreted as arising from a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf , e.g. yuan 2004 ; moscibrokzka 2009 ) . in this model , a fraction of the gaseous material accretes onto sgr  a@xmath0  and the rest is driven off as an outflow from sgr  a@xmath0  ( e.g. , quataert 2004 ; shcherbakov and baganoff 2010 ; wang 2013 ) .",
    "another mechanism that may reduce the accretion rate is interaction with a jet or an outflow limiting the amount of gas falling onto sgr  a * ( yusef - zadeh 2014a ) , thus modifying the accretion flow . in this picture",
    ", the interaction of the outflow with the surrounding gas or the atmosphere of mass - losing stars can provide an estimate of the power of the outflow .",
    "two different types of activity are associated with sgr a*. one is flaring on hourly time scale at multiple wavelengths ( e.g. , baganoff 2001 ; genzel 2003 ) .",
    "observations of sgr a * have detected a time delay at submm , mm , and radio wavelengths consistent with a scenario in which plasma blobs expand away from the disk , becoming visible at successive longer wavelengths as the optical depths become of order unity effects ( yusef - zadeh 2006 , 2008 , 2009 ; marrone 2008 ; eckart 2008 ; brinkerink 2015 ) .",
    "the other is a jet - driven outflow ( e.g. , falcke & markoff 2000 ) . unlike the flare activity , the existence of a jet from sgr",
    "a * has not been firmly established because of the complex thermal and nonthermal structures in this confused region of the galaxy .",
    "at least five independent investigations based on x - ray , near - ir , and radio observations have suggested that a jet is emanating from sgr  a@xmath0 .",
    "these studies have found discrepant values for the jet position angle ( pa ) and inclination ( markoff 2007 ; broderick 2011 ; zamaninasab 2011 ; muno 2008 ; li 2013 ; yusef - zadeh 2012 ; shahzamanian 2015 ) .",
    "it is possible that some of the gas approaching sgr a * is pushed away as part of an expanding hot plasma driven by flaring and jet activity , resulting sgr a * s low radiative efficiency .",
    "thus , the presence of collimated structures from sgr  a@xmath0 is critical in distinguishing between the competing accretion and outflow models .",
    "the galactic center is a challenging region in which to image a radio jet or a flare close to sgr  a@xmath0 , because of the limited spatial resolution and dynamic range caused by confusing sources , scatter broadening , and intrinsic temporal variability of sgr  a@xmath0 on hourly time scales ( e.g. , bower 2014 ) .",
    "here we present sensitive observations of the galactic center at multiple radio frequencies obtained using the improved broad - band capability of the vla , finding new radio structures interpreted to be associated with sgr a * activity .    on a scale of a few arcseconds from sgr a *",
    ", we identify a ridge of east - west radio emission which bends toward the sw in the direction away from sgr a*. this ridge , which is detected to the west of sgr a * , shows a number of blobs and arc - like features surrounded by a diffuse plume - like structure .",
    "we interpret that the plume - like feature as arising from flaring activity , thus produces an outflow from the direction of sgr a * on a scale of @xmath150.1 pc , with an opening angle of @xmath16 .",
    "the position angle of the outflow driven by flaring activity of sgr a * is consistent with the east - west elongation of sgr a * observed on milliarcsecond ( mas ) scale ( bower 2015 ) . a large number of stars being members of the so - called `` s - cluster''30 stars within a projected distance of 1@xmath17 from sgr a * , 2/3 of which are spectroscopically classified as o / b stars with orbital periods of a dozen to few hundred years and the rest older stars ( e.g. , genzel 2003 ) .",
    "we point out that the stars in this region have different spectral types and ages and probably heterogeneous origins ] also lie along the ridge .",
    "we compare infrared and radio images of the ridge and argue that bow - shock structures detected within the inner 2@xmath4 of sgr a * are proplyd candidates .",
    "we show that radio sources with comparable scale size to those associated with proplyds can not be simply blobs of dusty ionized gas but are associated with a reservoir of hot dust surrounded by ionized gas .    on a larger scale , within two arcminutes",
    "ne of sgr a * , we find new cometary sources ( f1 , f2 and f3 ) pointing toward sgr a * and a large - scale tower - like structure associated with the sgr a east supernova remnant ( snr ) 150@xmath4 from sgr a*. the position angle of these new structures is similar to two other ir - identified cometary sources , x3 and x7 , found to the sw of sgr a * ( muzic 2007 , 2010 ) .",
    "one interpretation that we put forth is that these features could be the result of a jet from sgr a * interacting with the atmosphere of dusty stars near sgr a * and with the sgr a east shell , respectively .",
    "in addition , we suggest that the diffuse x - ray emission centered on sgr a * arises through hot gas created by the collision of stellar winds from b stars in the s - star cluster or young low - mass stars ( c.f .",
    "loeb 2004 ) .",
    "this nuclear wind created by mass - losing stars near sgr a * produces hot expanding x - ray gas ( c.f .",
    "quataert 2004 ) that excludes the shocked winds from o and wr stars in the central parsec of the galaxy and prevents accretion onto sgr a*. meanwhile sgr a * accretes material from the cluster winds at a much lower rate potentially explaining the low luminosity of sgr a * without the ejection of a large fraction of the accreted material .",
    "multi - wavelength radio continuum observations were carried out with the karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) in its a - configuration at 44 , 34.5 , 8.5 , 5.5 and 1.4 ghz during march and april 2014 .",
    "table 1 gives columns of the date , center frequency , bandwidth , the number of subbands ( if ) , the number of channels , and the spatial resolution of each observation . in all observations",
    ", we used 3c286 to calibrate the flux density scale , 3c286 and j1733 - 1304 ( aka nrao530 ) to calibrate the bandpass , and j1744 - 3116 to calibrate the complex gains .",
    "the broad 8 ghz bandwidths at 34 and 44 ghz , 2 ghz bandwidths at 5 and 14 ghz , and 1 ghz bandwidth at 1.4 ghz provide a significant improvement over earlier observations that had only 100 mhz of bandwidth .",
    "we observed sgr a * using the 3-bit sampler system at 34 and 44 ghz , which provided full polarization correlations .",
    "details of the near - ir observations and data reduction of the galactic center at @xmath18 and @xmath19 bands , central wavelengths 2.18 , and 3.8 @xmath20 m , respectively , were recently given in yusef - zadeh ( 2015 ) .",
    "these observations used adaptive optics and were acquired with vlt / naco , with a pixel scale of 0.027@xmath17 per pixel .",
    "@xmath19-band observations were obtained in speckle mode using five fields with different pointing and depths .",
    "field1 was centered on sgr  a@xmath0 , and fields 25 were offset by approximately 20  to the northeast , southeast , southwest , and northwest , respectively .",
    "standard near - ir image data reduction was applied followed by combining individual pointings into large mosaics . in the case of the @xmath19 image , the speckle holography technique , as described in schdel ( 2013 ) , was applied to the thousands of obtained speckle frames to create final high - strehl images for each pointing . finally , we calibrated the images astrometrically by using the positions and proper motions of sio maser stars in the galactic center ( reid  2007 ) .",
    "imaging data in m@xmath2-band were taken with naco / vlt in 2003 , 2004 , and 2006 .",
    "we retrieved the data from the eso archive .",
    "chopping was used for background subtraction .",
    "the images were flat - fielded and corrected for bad pixels . since the chop throw was small in all observations ( due to technical limitations at the vlt )",
    "the images from the individual epochs show strong negative residuals from stellar and diffuse sources in the off - target chop positions .",
    "however , some dithering was applied during the observing runs and the initial pointing as well as the chopping angle were different for the different observing epochs .",
    "therefore , residuals could be effectively removed by averaging the images from all observing epochs ; the images were sub - pixel shifted onto a common position of the centroid of the star irs 16c and median combined .",
    "any remaining artifacts from chopping were effectively removed by rejecting the lowest 20% at each pixel before calculating the median value .",
    "approximately 12000 frames , each with 0.056 s integration time , were combined , corresponding to an accumulated exposure time of about 800 s. the photometry was calibrated by assuming constant extinction between the l and m bands and the same magnitudes at both bands for the sources irs 16c and irs 16nw .",
    "their l-band fluxes were taken from schdel ( 2010 ) .",
    "the uncertainty of the zero point was estimated to be 0.15 mag .",
    "because of better sensitivity to detect weak radio emission , we first present newly recognized features within a few arcseconds of sgr a * and then compare the positions of near - ir identified stellar sources with radio data .",
    "lastly , we present large structures on a scale between a few arcseconds to two arcminutes surrounding sgr a * and identify new features associated with the sgr a east snr shell .",
    "figure 1a , b show images of the inner 10  of sgr  a@xmath0  at mean frequencies ( wavelengths ) 34.5 ghz ( 9 mm ) and 14.1 ghz ( 2 cm ) .",
    "prominent stellar and ionized features are labeled .",
    "these images reveal a ridge of emission to the west of north of sgr  a@xmath0  extending for about 1.52  at position angles ranging between @xmath1590 and @xmath21 . this ridge of emission , which was previously detected in low resolution images at 8 ghz ( wardle and yusef - zadeh 1992 ) links sgr a * to the western edge of the minicavity , an ionized feature with a diameter of 2 .",
    "the western edge of the minicavity coincides with the two stellar clusters irs 13n and irs 13e .",
    "the sgr  a@xmath0  radio ridge consists of a number of blob - like and arc - like structures with angular scales of 0.20.5 .",
    "the two arc - like structures coincide with source @xmath22 which has been detected in earlier narrow bandwidth images with low spatial resolutions at 15 ghz ( yusef - zadeh 1990 ; zhao 1991 ) .",
    "to illustrate the asymmetric nature of the ridge structure , figure 1c shows a saturated image of the region shown in figure 1a , b .",
    "we interpret that this structure has an opening angle of @xmath16 pointed in the direction toward w and sw from sgr a*. figure 1d shows another 34.5 ghz rendition of the ridge of emission in reverse color , but at higher resolution than that of figure 1a .",
    "the images at multiple frequencies confirm the reality of blob and arc - like structures along the ridge .",
    "note the diffuse plume - like structure , as drawn schematically on figure 1a , surrounding the blob and arc - like structures .",
    "the widening of the plume - like structure away from sgr a * suggests that a plume of gaseous material is moving outward and expanding away , suggesting that sgr a * is responsible for the ridge .",
    "proper motion measurements of the brightest source in the ridge indicate high velocity ionized gas moving away from sgr a * to the sw ( zhao 2009 ) .",
    "this radio ridge appears distinct from the ionized gas associated with the mini - spiral hii region orbiting sgr a * and is not confused with numerous dusty stellar sources and diffuse emission found in mid - ir images of this region .",
    "future high resolution proper motion , polarization and spectral index measurements of the ridge will provide additional constraints in the claim that this feature is associated physically to sgr a*.      the region within @xmath152  of sgr a * where the ridge of radio emission and the plume - like structure are detected , is adjacent to the s - cluster .",
    "this cluster consists mostly of young , early type stars with orbital periods of 10 to a few 100 years .",
    "the kinematics of the stars in the cluster , which following other workers we refer to as @xmath23s stars@xmath4 , have been used to measure the mass of sgr a * ( ghez 2008 ; gillessen 2009 ) .",
    "figures 2a , b show contours of 34.5 ghz emission and a grayscale image of a region of @xmath24 centered on sgr a*. figure 2c shows contours of 5.5 ghz emission superimposed on a grayscale image . the crosses on figure 2a ,",
    "c correspond to eight radio sources rs18 found in the plume - like region to the west of sgr a*.    the trajectories of young stars are known from proper motion measurements in the near - ir . to see",
    "if these stars have radio continuum counterparts , their positions at the epoch of our 34 ghz observation on march 9 , 2014 ( 2014.19 ) have been calculated based on proper motions and orbital accelerations derived from near - ir observations ( gillessen 2009 ; lu 2006 ; yelda  2014 ) .",
    "tables 2 , 3 give the positions of s cluster and their corresponding positional uncertainties at the epoch of 2014.19 and from two different catalogs ( gillessen 2006 ; lu 2009 ) . table 4 gives the predicted x / y offsets ( in arcsecond ) of stars relative to sgr a * for the epoch 2014.19 .",
    "these tables list the positions of the 28 , 31 and 117 stars identified by gillessen ( 2009 ) , lu ( 2006 ) and yelda 2014 , respectively .",
    "table 5 lists gaussian - fitted positions of 8 radio sources ( rs18 ) embedded within the diffuse extended emission associated with the sgr a * ridge and the plume - like structure at 34 ghz ( see figs",
    ". 1 and 2 ) . entries in columns 1 to 9 give the name of the source at 34 ghz , alternative names in the literature , the ra and dec , the angular distance from sgr a * in increasing order , positional accuracy , the peak intensity and the flux density that are associated with these sources .",
    "figure 3a , b superimpose contours of radio emission on a 34 ghz grayscale image , with crosses indicating the positions of the stars in the s cluster for which orbits have been determined by gillessen ( 2009 ) and lu ( 2009 ) , respectively .",
    "many of the s - stars , as noted in figure 3a , are projected against the bright , scatter - broadened radio source sgr a * and the diffuse emission from the sgr a * ridge , thus they can not be discerned at radio wavelengths .",
    "the comparison of radio sources ( rss ) listed in table 5 with stellar sources given in table 2 indicates that rs1 , rs2 and rs3 lie within the 1@xmath25 position of s33 , which is an early type star ( gillessen 2009 ) .",
    "these radio sources appear compact but they are embedded within the extended emission from the ridge of emission ( see fig .",
    "2b ) so it is not clear if these sources are radio counterparts to s33 unless we measure the proper motion of radio sources .",
    "if these radio sources are not randomly coincident with s33 and are associated with stars , we can determine the mass loss rate from the ionized winds .",
    "the radio emission is assumed to arise from s33 with a flux density of @xmath26 mjy at 34.5 ghz and is due to a spherically - symmetric , homogeneous wind of fully ",
    "ionized gas expanding with a constant terminal velocity @xmath15700 ( panagia & felli 1975 ) .",
    "the mass loss rate of s33 is estimated to be @xmath27 yr@xmath11 .",
    "clumpiness of the ionized wind would reduce this estimate .",
    "figure 3c shows a grayscale 34 ghz image in negative and labeled with the positions of those stars for which orbits have been determined by yelda ( 2014 ) .",
    "we note several prominent young stars , irs  16sw , irs  16nw , irs  16c , that are not members of the s - cluster but have radio counterparts ( yusef - zadeh 2013 ) .",
    "figure 3d shows the distribution of stars over the area shown in figure 3c at 3.8@xmath20 m .",
    "the crosses correspond to the position of stars ( yelda 2014 ) at the epoch that radio data were taken .",
    "apart from stars labeled on this figure , the spectral classification of remaining faint sources is unknown .",
    "these faint sources are possibly late - type stars associated with the evolved nuclear cluster or young low - mass stars ( see @xmath28 ) .",
    "five near - ir stellar sources a  e are labeled on figure 3d and will be discussed below .",
    "figure 4a , b , c show the relative position of 34.5 ghz sources rs5  rs8 and 3.8 @xmath20 m and 2.18 @xmath20 m sources a  d with respect to each other .",
    "two of the newly detected radio sources in the ridge , rs5 and rs6 located @xmath29 from sgr a * ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , are partially resolved , with size scales ranging between 850 to 1200 au .",
    "a close - up views of these arc - like structures are shown in figure 4a whereas figures 4b , c show contours of 3.8 and 2.18@xmath20 m emission superimposed on a 34.5 ghz image , respectively .",
    "a comparison of radio with near - ir images reveals that the arc - like structures rs5 and rs6 have 3.8@xmath20 m counterparts with a bow shock morphology . there are two near - ir stellar sources , s1 - 22 ( lu 2009 ) and a stellar source a , as labeled on figure 4c .",
    "s1 - 22 lies at the apex of a bow shock - like structure and is an early type star which is projected against the extended radio emission associated with rs6 .",
    "star a has no radio counterpart , and is not identified in any catalogs of early type stars near sgr a*. it is unlikely that star a is associated with rs6 for two reasons .",
    "first , proper motion measurements indicate that star a is moving to the nw with a velocity of 117@xmath30 ( schdel 2009 ) . the proper motion of ionized gas associated with the blob @xmath22 which coincides with rs5 , rs6 and rs7 is @xmath31 to the sw ( zhao 2009 ) .",
    "second , it is unlikely that a late - type star could have a stellar wind strong enough to produce the observed stand - off distance of the bow - shock s apex , @xmath156 milliparsec ( mpc ) .",
    "this requires a wolf - rayet star ( tanner 2005 ; sanchez - bermudez 2014 ) .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that star a is associated with the bow - shock structure rs5 .    as for s1 - 22",
    ", the proper motion data gives a tangential velocity of @xmath15326 to the se ( yelda 2014 ) .",
    "radio proper motion measurements have a coarse arcsecond spatial resolution , giving the proper motion of rs5 , r6 and rs7 , when compared to those of near - ir sources . in spite of the difference in resolution between radio and near - ir proper motion measurements , the magnitude of radio proper motion of rs5 , rs6 and rs7 is similar to that of s1 - 22 .",
    "thus , it is possible that s1 - 22 is physically associated with rs6 with the standoff distance of @xmath154 mpc .",
    "in addition to star a , three 3.8@xmath20 m sources b , c and d , labeled on figures 4b , c , are not found in the catalogs of early type stars .",
    "rs7 and rs8 are likely to be radio counterparts to source b , and c , respectively .",
    "a radio source with a flux density of 58 @xmath20jy at 34 ghz is detected at the position of source d which lies in an extended region associated with the ridge .",
    "the bright radio sources b and d are clearly stellar sources since they are detected at l@xmath2 and k@xmath1 bands .",
    "the offsets seen in the position of radio and near - ir sources could have a contribution from proper motion of individual sources .",
    "the near - ir images at 2.18 and 3.8@xmath20 m were taken during june and september 2012 whereas the 34.5 ghz data was taken on march 9 , 2014 .",
    "the l@xmath2 sources associated with rs5 , rs7 ( or source a ) , rs8 ( or source b ) , and d , lie to the sse of their radio counterparts , suggesting either correlated motion , coincidence , or a systematic error in the image registration arising because the radio and infrared images are taken at different epochs .",
    "we compared gaussian fitted positions of b , c and d at 34.5 ghz and l@xmath2 band and found 3.4 and 3 sigma offsets to the north in the positions of stars b and d and their radio counterparts , respectively .",
    "we also compared the positional offset for irs 16c and its radio counterpart and determined that this implies a proper motion of irs 16 that is roughly twice higher the actual value determined at radio and infrared wavelengths ( lu 2009 ; yusef - zadeh 2015a ) .",
    "thus , we can not establish that radio sources are counterparts to stellar sources .",
    "given the offsets in positions and the non - detection of source c in k@xmath1 , it is just possible that the radio sources are gas blobs and are not directly associated with stars .",
    "however , it is not clear how gas blobs near sgr a * could survive the tidal shear of sgr a * unless they have densities that withstand the tidal shear or that they are transient ( yusef - zadeh 2015c ) .        there are two known cometary sources , x3 and x7 , lying within 3@xmath4 to the sw of sgr a * at near - ir wavelengths .",
    "x3 is located @xmath32 from sgr a * ( muzic 2007 , 2010 ) showing tail - head structure pointing toward sgr a*. it has a radio counterpart at 44 ghz ( source 16 in yusef - zadeh 2014b ) and a peak flux density 0.22 mjy beam@xmath11 at 34.5 ghz .",

    "the consequence of this interaction infers not only the mass loss rate from sgr a * but also provides a lower bound on the accretion rate onto sgr a*. fourth , the ridge of radio emission is interpreted as due to past flaring activity associated with sgr a*.      the nature of the radio sources within two arcseconds of sgr a * is not clear .",
    "two arc - like radio sources rs5 and rs6 resemble the bow - shock sources found at 34 ghz about @xmath57 away from sgr a * ( yusef - zadeh 2015c ) . as displayed in figures 4b , c , rs5 and rs6 have near - ir counterparts .",
    "although there is an early type star s1 - 22 that may be associated with rs6 , rs5 is not identified as a near - ir star in various catalogs ( e.g. , lu 2009 , 2013 ) .",
    "there is no evidence for a known young and massive star associated with rs5 .",
    "rs5 has 3.8 and 2.18@xmath20 m counterparts suggesting the the dust , traced by near - ir emission , and ionized gas , as traced at radio , are either intermixed , or else closely related through separate , as observed in photodissociating regions ( pdrs ) .",
    "because of the strong radiation field that produces high temperature of the ionized gas , as traced by radio emission , dust grains mixed in with ionized gas would have been evaporated .",
    "thus , rs5 resembles the population of bow - shock sources that have recently been found 20@xmath4 from sgr a * and are interpreted as candidate photoevaporative protoplanetary disks ( proplyds ) associated with newly formed low - mass stars ( yusef - zadeh 2015c ) . the short expansion time scale and the low density of ionized gas associated with the arc - like structures provide strong arguments in favor of protoplanetary disks ( li & loeb 2013 ; yusef - zadeh 2015c ) .    to examine the protoplanetary disk scenario , we compared radio and near - ir flux from rs5 and another proplyd candidate , the so - called p8 source ( fig .",
    "2c in yusef - zadeh 2015 ) .",
    "p8 is among 44 proplyd candidates found within 25@xmath4 of sgr a*. figures 11a , b show a horizontal slice that crosses rs5 and p8 , respectively , at 35 ghz , and the l@xmath2 and k@xmath1 near - ir bands . the arrows point to the location of proplyd candidates .",

    "assuming that radio emission traces the ionization front of proplyd candidates , we use the flux at l@xmath2 and k@xmath1 to determine the temperature of dust emission from the outer surface of a hot disk .",

    "the infrared emission is unresolved at k@xmath1 band , implying that the solid angle is less than ( 27 mas)@xmath59 , equivalent to radius @xmath68au at 8kpc . adopting 3 magnitudes of extinction in k@xmath1 band and noting that @xmath69 , equation ( 1 ) yields the extinction corrected k@xmath1 and l@xmath2 fluxes for a dust temperature of 740k in a layer at the disk surface with @xmath70 .",
    "these values are reasonable providing that the external radiation field is strong enough .",
    "to check this , we note that the bolometric luminosity estimated from the 3.8@xmath20 m flux is @xmath71 . adopting a total luminosity @xmath72 in the inner 0.1pc due to the population of hot stars surrounding sgr a * , implies then the disk intercepts @xmath73 , suggesting that @xmath74au .",
    "source p8 is less constrained with an extincted l@xmath2 band flux of 1.8mjy , and a k@xmath1 band upper limit of 0.5 mjy .",
    "this yields an upper limit on the dust temperature of @xmath75k .",
    "the high dust temperature associated with rs5 and p8 imply that these ionized features are associated with a layer of hot dust and that they are not blobs of ionized gas .",
    "the luminosity and column density of gas estimated from near - ir data here are very similar to those made toward proplyds found in orion ( shuping 2006 ) .",
    "the euv lyman continuum ionization radiation from a smaller number of massive stars is estimated to be @xmath76s@xmath11 ( genzel , hollenbach & townes 1994 ) and for an assumed @xmath77 pc distance from the source of ionization , the incident ionizing photon flux is @xmath78s@xmath11cm@xmath60 .",
    "we also note that the peak flux densities of radio source rs5 is roughly five times stronger than those of distant proplyd candidates ( p8 and p26 in yusef - zadeh 2015 ) , consistent with the suggestion that rs5 is photo - ionized by the stellar cluster near sgr a*.    another possibility is that these bowshock structure are blobs of ionized gas and hot dust that orbit around sgr a * and have a short photoevaporative lifetime .",
    "as discussed by yusef - zadeh ( 2015 ) the photoevaporation time scale is @xmath80yr , unless there is a reservoir of neutral material associated with a low - mass star .",
    "in addition , the dusty blob must be bound by self gravity to avoid tidal disruption by sgr a*. a distance of 0.1 pc from sgr a * , the density of the blob must exceed @xmath81 with a @xmath82 .",

    ", we note that the g2 source was considered to be a cloud of dust and gas orbiting sgr a * ( gillessen 2012 ) .",
    "however , recent measurements suggest that g2 is unlikely to be an isolated cloud of gas and must have an embedded core , possibly a pre - main sequence star ( scoville and burkert 2013 ; witzel 2014 ) .",
    "future submm observations should test this scenario by searching for emission from cool dust in the inner disks of the proplyd candidates .",
    "to first order , the diffuse x - ray emission centered on sgr a * is fit by an optically - thin thermal plasma with @xmath83 = 3.5 kev , total x - ray luminosity in the 2 - 10 kev band @xmath84 erg s@xmath11 , and mass @xmath85 ( baganoff 2003 ; wang 2013 ) , implying a mean number density @xmath86 .",

    "however , the discovery of populations of young stars within the s - cluster which consists of @xmath1516 b dwarfs and 3 o stars on highly - eccentric orbits within 1@xmath4 , begs the question whether mass loss from these stars plays a dominant role in supplying gas to the vicinity of sgr a*. loeb ( 2004 ) suggested that mass loss from the s - stars could explain this hot gas . in this picture winds from the stars are shocked to high temperature because of the high orbital speeds of the s - stars . to attain a shock temperature of 3.5kev requires a shock speed @xmath91 , which corresponds to the keplerian speed at 6mpc ( 0.15 ) from sgr a*. loeb ( 2004 ) suggested that the s - stars were ob or wr stars with powerful winds , but it is now known that they are mainly b stars .",
    "theoretical calculations suggest that b stars have individual mass loss rates @xmath92yr@xmath11 ( e.g.  vink , de koter & lamers 2000 ; puls , vink & navarro 2008 ) , insufficient to replenish the hot gas .",
    "however , the mass loss rates are known to be severely underpredicted , and recent modeling of the shells blown in molecular clouds by young a and b stars suggests far higher rates , @xmath88@xmath93yr@xmath11 ( offner & arce 2015 ) .",
    "thus , the suggestion that the wind created by the merging of individual stellar winds from the b stars in the s - star cluster expands and excludes the shocked winds from o and wr stars in the central parsec of the galaxy ( c.f .",
    "loeb 2004 )    the increasing evidence for ysos within arcsecond of sgr a * , such as the sources rs5 and p8 as discussed in this paper , suggests that ysos may be intermingled with the disk and s - star populations . as pointed out earlier , the so - called g2 cloud could be another low - mass yso candidate orbiting sgr a * ( scoville and burkert 2013 ) .",
    "the young , massive stars within @xmath15 0.05pc - 0.5pc of sgr a * , a fraction of which are found on the so - called clockwise rotating disk , are formed between 2.5 and 6 myrs ago ( lu et al 2009 ) .",

    "the intensity of the synchrotron emission from the tower , i.e. 2.8mjy per @xmath113 beam at 1.5ghz implies an equipartition field of 0.7 mg and a total pressure of @xmath114 erg @xmath45 ( here we have adopted a source depth 1pc , an @xmath115 electron spectrum extending between 1mev and 10gev , and assumed that the energy density in protons is 100 times that for the electrons ) .",
    "the jet pressure is comparable to to the magnetic pressure in the nonthermal shell of sgr a east , thus the jet is able to push through .",
    "this picture implies that sgr a east lies close to sgr a*. the absorption of sgr a west against sgr a east ( yusef - zadeh & morris 1987 ; pedlar 1989 ) suggest that the ne jet must be moving away from us to be interacting with the shell of sgr a east .",

    "given that almost all the cometary sources , x3 , x7 , source f1 ( radio cometary ) and f2 ( mir cometary ) , have the same position angle to that of polarized sources p1 and p4 and the sgr a east tower , a collimated outflow from sgr a * could be better alternative to explain the origin of cometary structures .    the cometary sources are marginally resolved , implying stand - off distances equivalent to @xmath116mas at 8kpc , ie .",

    "one possible explanation for the ridge of radio emission is related the flaring activity of sgr a*. past monitoring campaigns have found evidence for time delay of @xmath123 minutes between the peak emission at 43 and 22 ghz ( yusef - zadeh 2006 , 2009 ; brinkerink 2015 ) .",
    "this time delay is consistent with a picture in which an overpressured synchrotron emitting plasma blob at these wavelengths is initially optically thick .",
    "the blob then expands subrelativistically , peaks and declines at each frequency once it becomes optically thin . in this picture , the blob - like and arc - like structures noted in the east - west ridge of emission detected at radio wavelengths are interpreted to be expanding blobs produced by flaring activity escaping from sgr a*. if the thermal density of expanding blobs is sufficient to overcome the external pressure , the outflow rate of thermal blobs of plasma is estimated to be @xmath124yr@xmath11 ( yusef - zadeh 2006 ) . the expansion blob model has successfully been applied to flaring activity of microquasars where outflows have been detected ( e.g. , fender and belloni 2004 ) .",
    "another possibility is that the ridge of radio emission results from the interaction of thermal winds from the cluster of young massive stars with the gravitational potential of sgr a*. wardle and yusef - zadeh ( 1992 ) considered a picture in which the irs 16 stars are the source of ionized winds interacting with sgr a*. in this picture , thermal winds are focused by sgr a * and form blobs of hot gas in the sgr a * ridge .",
    "given that recent observations indicated that mass - losing stars are members of a cluster that lie in a disk orbiting sgr a * , it is not clear how the ridge is produced asymmetrically on one side of sgr a*.    vlba measurements on mas scale have identified elongated structure associated with sgr a * at 43 ghz with a position angle of 95@xmath52 ( bower 2014 ) .",
    "these authors explain this elongation in terms of both jet and accretion disk models . the radio plume and the ridge of emission closest to sgr a * in figure 1a lie along a position angle similar to the intrinsic elongation of sgr a*.",
    "this suggests that the elongation of sgr a * might be associated with blobs of radio emission detected within the ridge but on a scale roughly 2000 times smaller than the ridge of emission from sgr a*. the inference is that the radio sources in the plume - like and ridge structures are indirectly tracing the interaction of an outflow due to flaring activity of sgr a * and stars located in the s cluster .",
    "the orientation of the outflow from flaring activity is not collimated by the disk so the opening angle could be large , as evidenced in the plume structure . on the other hand , the jet from sgr a * is presumably collimated by the disk and has a different pa than that of blobs of gas ejected from the corona of the accretion disk of sgr a * due to its flare activity .        in summary ,",

    "we also argued that stellar winds from low mass ysos within the s cluster merge to form a cluster wind that interacts with the surrounding orbiting ionized gas and excludes the combined winds from the massive stars in the central parsec of the galaxy .",
    "the accretion rate of the s - cluster wind onto sgr a * is @xmath127yr@xmath11 , helping to explain the low luminosity of sgr a*. this is an alternative to models in which the low luminosity is due to ejection of the bulk of the material accreted from larger radii . in our picture",
    ", the cluster wind accounts the observed mass of x - ray gas within 1@xmath4 of sgr a * has a residence time of @xmath128 years .",
    "this x - ray gas plays two major roles .",
    "one is that the injected material during the cooling time of x - ray gas @xmath129 years expands away and leaves the inner 1@xmath4 of sgr a*. the injected ionized winds from the low - mass and/or young stars prevents the material beyond 1@xmath4 of sgr a * to reach sgr a*. the second role of the x - ray gas surrounding sgr a * is that the accretion rate to the injected material by stars is at least two orders of magnitude lower than the bondi accretion rate of @xmath130 yr@xmath11 .",
    "this is because the injected mass from stars has a much higher velocity due to their orbital motion and is highly stirred near sgr a*. thus , a very small fraction of the x - ray gas accretes onto sgr a*.    on a larger scale , we interpreted a number of cometary features and the distorted shape of the sgr a east snr in terms of the interaction of a collimated jet - driven outflow with the surrounding medium and impinging on stellar envelopes as well as a portion of the nonthermal sgr a east shell .",
    "lastly , we interpret that the east - west ridge of radio emission results from flaring activity of sgr a*. flares are explained in terms of expanding , over - pressured , plasma blobs that escape the gravitational potential of sgr a*. unlike the jet - driven outflows , the outflowing material should not be highly collimated .",
    "finally , we note that many of these suggestions can be tested by high resolution proper motion and submm measurements .",

    "<S> the ridge suggests that an outflow of east - west blob - like structures is emerging from sgr  a@xmath0 . </S>",
