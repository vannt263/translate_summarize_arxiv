    "second , the carrier confinement and reduced dielectric screening leads to large many - body effects , such as the formation of strongly bound excitons  @xcite , trions  @xcite , and biexcitons  @xcite with very large binding energies .",
    "a unified understanding of the optical properties must treat both of these aspects on equal footing , and significant effort is now being focused on investigating the detailed spectroscopy of excitons in monolayer tmdcs .    in the ongoing effort to understand excitons in these materials ,",
    "multiple spectroscopic techniques have been employed , including reflectance  @xcite , photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy  @xcite scanning tunneling spectroscopy  @xcite , and two - photon luminescence  @xcite .",
    "a rigorous knowledge of the spectroscopic selection rules for excitons in monolayer tmdcs is crucial for the proper interpretation of these and future experiments . in this paper , we develop a model - based framework which is sufficiently detailed to provide quantitative results , but also sufficiently simple to allow precise statements about symmetry - determined selection rules .",
    "we describe the connection to our previous work based on an effective mass theory of excitons  @xcite , and identify the key microscopic physical factors that determine the properties of excitons and their interaction with photons .",

    "this is in quite stark contrast with the results of the present work , which suggest that the 2@xmath2 exciton should be lower in energy by _ at least _ 50 mev .",
    "we hope that future work , both experimental and theoretical , is devoted to investigating this discrepancy .",

    "this extension allows for deviations from parabolicity , including trigonal warping behavior which has been emphasized in other contexts  @xcite .",
    "we find that two- and three - band models of the single - particle band structure give nearly identical results for the exciton properties within a simplified bse formalism , suggesting that trigonal warping is a secondary effect .",
    "furthermore , our numerical results are nearly identical to those of the effective mass treatment from our previous work  @xcite , justifying its use in those contexts .",
    "we have definitively proved that spin - singlet excitons with @xmath1-type azimuthal symmetry , which have been the most studied  @xcite , are indeed the optically bright excitons . as in our previous work  @xcite",
    ", we confirm that the disposition of bright exciton states is distinctly non - hydrogenic .",

    "@xcite have identified the same qualitative behavior .",
    "this observation will be key in future analyses of two - photon spectroscopies on tmdcs .",
    "a recent manuscript contains results from a fully _ ab initio _ bse calculation on ws@xmath4 and also finds this peculiar angular momentum behavior  @xcite .",
    "it is clearly encouraging that our simple low - energy theory  featuring a few - band representation of the single - particle states and an appropriate treatment of screening with a model dielectric function  is able to correctly reproduce the optical selection rules , the character of bright and dark exciton states , the broken angular momentum degeneracy , the quantitatively large exciton binding energies , and the spectral features of the nonlinear two - photon absorption . in this regard",
    ", we believe the model presented here represents perhaps the simplest predictive minimal model capable of unifying these wide - ranging features in monolayer tmdcs .    _ note added .",
