    "@xcite in the case of the heisenberg exchange @xmath27 reduces to a delta - function . but how does this reduction occur with decrease in anisotropy ?    in low dimensions @xmath28 interaction and disorder can induce a transition between paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases at a finite temperature @xmath24 .",

    "we rigorously prove that in the case of ising ( heisenberg ) exchange all moments of static longitudinal spin susceptibility @xmath23 are finite for @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) . for the ising exchange",
    "we argue also that all moments of dynamic transverse spin susceptibility @xmath25 do not diverge for @xmath41 .",
    "we estimate the tail of the complementary cumulative distribution function for @xmath23 for both ising and heisenberg exchange interactions . we demonstrate that the average static longitudinal spin susceptibility @xmath23 has nonmonotonous dependence on magnetic field in the case of ising exchange .",
