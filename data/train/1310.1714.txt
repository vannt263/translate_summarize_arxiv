    "proton - nucleus interactions at the lhc allow for the study of fundamental properties of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at low parton fractional momentum @xmath9 and high gluon densities @xcite and they provide a reference for the studies of deconfined matter created in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "measurements of charm particle production in central pb - pb collisions at @xmath10  tev showed a suppression of the d - meson yield with respect to the binary - scaled pp yield in a broad @xmath11 range @xcite .",
    "this effect is consistent with the energy loss of charm quarks while they traverse the hot and dense medium formed in such collisions . to come to a quantitative understanding of the energy loss results , it is important to disentangle hot medium effects from initial - state effects due to cold nuclear matter , such as a modification of the parton distribution functions in the nucleus @xcite and gluon saturation effects @xcite",
    ". initial - state effects can be isolated by studying the d meson production in p - pb collisions , where a hot medium is not expected to form .",
    "a sensitive observable is the nuclear modification factor , @xmath8 . in case of minimum bias @xmath0 interactions @xmath8",
    "is defined as @xmath12 , where a is the number of nucleons in the lead nucleus , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the production cross sections of d mesons in pp and @xmath0 collisions respectively . in these proceedings",
    ", we present the results obtained from a data sample of @xmath15100 m @xmath0 collisions at @xmath1 tev collected with a minimum bias trigger defined in alice by the coincidence of signals in the two vzero detectors , consisting of two arrays of scintillator counters covering the pseudorapidity regions @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the analysis strategy is based on the invariant mass analysis of fully reconstructed decay topologies .",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 mesons and their antiparticles are reconstructed via their hadronic decay channels @xmath3 ( with branching ratio , br , of @xmath22 % ) , @xmath4 ( br of @xmath23 % ) , @xmath5 ( br of @xmath24 % ) and @xmath6 with the subsequent decay @xmath25 ( br of @xmath26 % ) @xcite .",
    "the extraction of the d - meson signals out of the large combinatorial background from uncorrelated tracks is based on the reconstruction and selection of secondary vertex topologies with a separation of a few hundred micrometers from the primary vertex .",
    "the time projection chamber ( tpc ) and the inner tracking system ( its ) detectors , in particular its two innermost layers equipped with silicon pixel detectors , provide a resolution of the track impact parameter of about 70  @xmath27 m for tracks with @xmath28  gev/@xmath29 . to further suppress the combinatorial background , particle identification ( pid ) on the d - meson decay products is employed .",
    "pid is performed using the information on specific energy deposit in the tpc and on the time of flight measured with the time of flight ( tof ) detector .",
    "the signal yield is extracted by fitting the invariant mass distribution using a gaussian function for the signal peak .",
    "the background is fitted using an exponential shape in the case of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath21 . for the @xmath20 , the distribution of @xmath30",
    "is fitted with a threshold function convoluted with an exponential .",
    "the raw yields extracted by the fit are divided by 2 to give the average ( particle and antiparticle ) cross section .",
    "the correction for acceptance and efficiency is performed using monte carlo simulations based on pythia with the perugia-0 tuning to generate the d - meson signals on top of an underlying event generated with hijing .",
    "the efficiencies are weighted to take into account the dependence of the d - meson production on the number of charged particles produced in the collisions .    in order to extract the cross section of prompt d mesons",
    ", the contribution of d mesons from b decays is subtracted .",
    "this b feed - down contribution is evaluated using the b - meson cross - section from fonll @xcite , the @xmath31 decay kinematics from evtgen @xcite , and the efficiencies for prompt and feed - down d mesons from simulations .",
    "fonll calculations are used because they describe well the beauty hadron cross sections measured at the tevatron @xcite and at the lhc @xcite , @xcite . to account for possible initial - state effects on the beauty - quark production ,",
    "the resulting yield of d mesons from b feed - down is multiplied by a nuclear modification factor @xmath32 of d mesons from b decays .",
    "the central value for the calculation is chosen as @xmath33 while the systematic uncertainty is evaluated by varying the hypothesis on the @xmath8 of feed - down d mesons in the range @xmath34/@xmath35 .",
    "this hypothesis is tuned on the basis of calculations obtained combining nlo pqcd cross sections from mnr @xcite ,",
    "eps09 @xcite parameterizations of the nuclear parton distribution functions and b - decay kinematics from the evtgen package @xcite .",
    "the large uncertainty on the predictions at low @xmath11 is taken into account .    the d - meson production cross section in pp collisions at @xmath1 tev needed for the @xmath8 calculation",
    "is obtained by scaling the measured d meson production cross section at @xmath36 tev using the ratio of fonll predictions at @xmath37 and 7 tev with the procedure described in @xcite . the uncertainty on the scaling decreases with increasing @xmath11 from 17% to 3% as estimated by varying the parameters entering the fonll calculations , namely the factorization and renormalization scales and the charm quark mass .",

    "several sources of uncertainties are considered .",
    "the systematic uncertainty on the yield extraction is determined in each @xmath11 interval by repeating the fit in a different mass range , varying the background fit function ( a parabola instead of an exponential for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath21 and a power law multiplied by an exponential or a polynomial for the @xmath20 ) and by counting the histogram entries in the invariant mass region of the signal after subtracting the background estimated from the side bands .",
    "the effect of the imperfect implementation of the detector description in the monte carlo simulations is estimated by repeating the analysis with different selections on the track quality and on the decay topology . the uncertainty associated to the particle identification",
    "is studied by comparing the cross sections obtained with and without pid . the effect on the selection efficiency due to the shape of the simulated d meson spectrum",
    "is estimated from the relative difference between the monte carlo efficiencies obtained using different @xmath11 shapes ( pythia , fonll , flat @xmath11 distribution ) .",
