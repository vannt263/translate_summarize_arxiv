    "low - mass vector meson ( lvm ) production in collisions is an important tool to study quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , providing data to tune phenomenological soft qcd models and to compare to hard perturbative qcd calculations .",
    "various experiments  @xcite have studied lvm at different colliding energies and in different kinematic regions .    in addition , lvm production in collisions provides a reference for high - energy heavy - ion - collision measurements .",
    "lvm studies provide key information on the hot and dense state of the strongly interacting matter produced in such collisions . among them ,",
    "strangeness enhancement  @xcite , a phenomenon associated with soft particles in bulk matter , can be accessed through the measurements of @xmath2-meson production  @xcite and the @xmath2/(@xmath12 ) ratio .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath1 spectral function can be used to reveal in - medium modifications of the hadron properties close to the qcd phase boundary linked to chiral symmetry restoration  @xcite . however",
    ", measuring the @xmath1 spectral function in the two - muon channel requires better mass resolution than is provided by the muon spectrometers of the phenix experiment at the relativistic heavy ion collider .",
    "having two muon spectrometers covering the rapidity range @xmath3 , phenix is able to study vector - meson production via the dimuon decay channel . because there is no similar measurement in this kinematic regime at this energy , the forward rapidity measurements are a valuable addition to the database and are complementary to previously published midrapidity results  @xcite .",
    "we report the differential cross section as a function of and rapidity of @xmath13 and @xmath2 mesons for @xmath14  gev/@xmath9 and @xmath3 .",
    "results presented in this paper are based on the data sample collected in 2009 using the phenix muon spectrometers in collisions at  =  200  gev .",
    "the sampled luminosity of the data used in this analysis corresponds to 14.1 pb@xmath15 .",
    "the phenix apparatus is described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "this analysis uses the dimuon decay channel of the low mass vector mesons .",
    "the detectors relevant for reconstruction and triggering are the two muon spectrometers  @xcite and the two beam - beam counters ( bbcs ) in the forward and backward rapidities .",
    "the muon spectrometers , located behind an absorber composed of 19 cm copper and 60 cm iron , include the muon tracker ( mutr ) , which is in a radial magnetic field with an integrated bending power of 0.8 tesla - meter , followed by the muon identifier ( muid ) .",
    "the muon spectrometers cover the range @xmath16 over the full azimuth .",
    "the mutr comprises three sets of cathode strip chambers while the muid comprises five planes of iarocci tubes interleaved with steel absorber plates .",
    "the composite momentum resolution , @xmath17 , of particles in the analyzed momentum range is about 5% independent of momentum and dominated by multiple scattering , and the lvm mass resolution is 85 mev/@xmath18 .",
    "muon candidates are identified by reconstructed tracks in the mutr matched to muid tracks that penetrate through to the last muid plane .",
    "the minimum momentum of a muon to reach the last muid plane is @xmath192 gev/@xmath9",
    ".    beam - beam counters ( bbc ) , consisting of two arrays of 64 erenkov counters covering the pseudorapidity range @xmath20 , were used to measure the collision vertex along the beam axis ( @xmath21 ) with 2-cm resolution in addition to providing a minimum - bias trigger .",
    "the data set for this analysis was recorded in 2009 using a minimum - bias trigger that required at least one hit in each of the bbcs .",
    "additionally , the muid level-1 dimuon trigger was used which required that at least two tracks penetrate through the muid to its last layer .",
    "a set of quality assurance cuts is applied to the data to select good muon candidates and improve the signal to background ratio .",
    "the bbc collision z vertex is required to be within @xmath2230 cm of the center of the interaction region along the beam direction .",
    "the mutr tracks are matched to the muid tracks at the first muid layer in both position and angle . in addition , the track trajectory is required to have at least 8 of 10 possible hits in the muid .",
    "the invariant mass distribution is formed by combining muon candidate tracks of opposite charge .",
    "in addition to low mass vector mesons , the invariant mass spectra contains uncorrelated and correlated backgrounds .",
    "the uncorrelated backgrounds arise from random combinatoric associations of unrelated muons candidates while the correlated backgrounds arise from open charm decay ( e.g. , @xmath23 where both decay semileptonically to muons ) , open bottom decay , @xmath24 and @xmath0 dalitz decays and the drell - yan process .",
    "traditionally , the combinatorial background is estimated and subtracted by two methods .",
    "the first method uses the mass spectra of the like - sign pairs that are reconstructed within the same event .",
    "the other forms unlike - sign and like - sign pairs from different events and is often referred to as the `` mixed - event method . '' in the like - sign method , the like - sign pairs are expected to originate from combinatorial processes ; in addition there can be correlated pairs within a single event  @xcite . in the case of the mixed event method ,",
    "unlike - sign pairs are formed from tracks from different events which provides purely combinatorial pairs  @xcite .",
    "the results of using these two methods are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fgbg ] .",
    "( color online ) the unlike - sign dimuon invariant mass spectrum before background subtraction ( solid black points ) , after subtracting mixed events background ( empty red triangles ) and after subtracting like - sign background ( empty blue circles ) . ]",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : fgbg ] that the two methods are not able to reproduce the background in the low mass region .",
    "hence , we introduce a new data driven technique here .",
    "the background below 1.4 gev/@xmath25 is dominated by    1 .",
    "@xmath26 decays that occur before reaching the absorber 2 .",
    "punch - through hadrons with high that are misidentified as muons and 3 .   muons that result from decay in the muon tracker volume .",
    "a @xmath27 statistic is calculated from a simultaneous fit of the two muon tracks with a common event determined by the bbc .",
    "tracks due to the backgrounds listed above produce a broader @xmath27 distribution than that of true muon tracks , and this difference can be used to discriminate statistically between foregrounds and backgrounds .",
    "we classify pairs with @xmath28 as foreground pairs and those with @xmath29 as background pairs .",
    "the value , @xmath30 , was selected such that we retain as much of the signal as possible , while still allowing enough statistics in our background sample .",

    "the histograms are normalized to the total number of events . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : chi2vtx](a ) shows the unlike - sign pairs @xmath31 distribution , which is narrower in the resonance region dominated by prompt dimuons ( e.g , in the @xmath32 region , @xmath33  gev/@xmath18 ) , and wider in the nonresonant regions . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath31 distribution for the like - sign pairs is the same in both mass regions .",
    "in addition , the unlike - sign @xmath31 distribution matches very well that of the like - sign in the nonresonant region . after selecting the foreground and background from the data ,",
    "the background is normalized to the foreground by two normalization methods : the first method uses the unlike - sign pairs , where the ratio of the foreground to background spectra is fitted by a polynomial in the nonresonant region and the background spectra are then multiplied by the fit function .",
    "the other uses the ratio of like - sign pairs corresponding to @xmath34 and @xmath35 to determine the functional form of the shape of the background .",
    "this function is then normalized to match the unlike - sign distribution in the nonresonant regions , @xmath36  gev/@xmath18 and @xmath37  gev/@xmath18 .",

    "the insert in ( b ) shows the muon arms acceptance and reconstruction efficiency . ]    both estimates of the background match the nonresonant region of the unlike - sign spectrum .",
    "however , because the second method includes a two - step normalization which introduces higher statistical fluctuations upon the background subtraction , the second method is only used for a cross check .",
    "the insert in fig .",
    "[ fig : bknorm](b ) shows that the acceptance and reconstruction efficiency drops quickly at low mass which explains the higher @xmath32 yield compared to the low mass vector mesons .    to ensure the robustness of the yield extraction ,",
    "an additional yield extraction procedure is employed .",
    "the background is fitted with a polynomial and the result of the fit is added to signal fits which are then fitted to the dimuon invariant mass spectrum while constraining the added function with the background spectra fit parameters . the background normalization is a free parameter .    the unlike - sign dimuon spectra , with @xmath34 , in the region of interest ( @xmath38 gev/@xmath18 ) have contributions from three mesons , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath2 meson is partly resolved while @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons are completely merged , hence the combined yield for @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons was extracted .",
    "it was found that the reconstructed mass spectra of the simulated @xmath0 and @xmath2 are fitted well by gaussian distributions , while in the case of @xmath1 , a breit wigner distribution matched the mass spectrum , which motivated using these distributions to fit the invariant mass spectra .",
    "the background subtracted dimuon spectra in the low mass region , @xmath39 gev/@xmath18 , are fitted with two gaussian distributions and a breit wigner distribution . the means and widths ( @xmath40 for breit wigner distribution ) of the reconstructed @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "were extracted using the phenix simulation chain and used as a first approximation in fitting the data .",
    "the masses and widths are free parameters in the fit to account for small detector effects which result in @xmath41% variations with respect to the pdg values .",
    "in addition to these distributions , the dimuon spectra without background subtraction are fitted with a polynomial .",
    "it is important to note that the parameters from data and simulation fits converged to the same values within uncertainties without any systematic shifts .",

    "figure  [ fig : northsigbkgdfit](a ) shows the unlike - sign dimuon invariant mass spectrum ( solid black circles ) and the background spectrum ( empty blue circles ) , while ( b ) shows the same background spectrum fitted with a fourth order polynomial .",

    "a first order polynomial was added to the fit and the yields re - extracted and the resulting yields changed by less than 1% . figure  [ fig : northsigbkgdfit](d ) shows the unlike - sign dimuon invariant mass spectrum without background subtraction fitted by two gaussian distributions , a breit wigner distribution and a fourth order polynomial constrained from the fit results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : northsigbkgdfit](b ) . the yields extracted using the two methods illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : northsigbkgdfit](c ) and ( d ) gave consistent results , well within uncertainties .",
    "the data are binned as a function of over the range @xmath8 gev/@xmath9 for the rapidities @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , the data integrated over the range @xmath8 gev/@xmath9 were studied as a function of rapidity . the raw yields in this measurement",
    "were extracted using background subtraction as well as background fit methods , and in the case of the background fit , several polynomials of different orders were attempted . as an example , the invariant mass spectra are fitted by the function that includes a fourth order polynomial , as defined below ,    @xmath42    where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are a breit - wigner and a gaussian functions , respectively , and @xmath45 is a fourth order polynomial . @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the yields of @xmath0 and @xmath2 , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are their mean values .",
    "the fit functions of @xmath0 ( gaussian ) and @xmath1 ( breit wigner ) are constrained to have the same mean value and the ratio of their yields , @xmath50 is set to 0.58 .",
