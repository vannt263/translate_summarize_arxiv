    "the model studied in this work is a not - to - distant cousin of directed percolation . in view of his extensive and continuing contributions to percolation theory",
    ", it gives me great pleasure to dedicate this work to my friend george stell , who has taught me much about physics ( and perhaps more about music ) .    when viewed as a spatio - temporal process ( the oriented axis representing time ) , directed percolation exhibits an absorbing - state phase transition , that is , a transition between an active state and one in which the dynamics is frozen .",
    "critical phenomena at absorbing - state phase transitions are of longstanding interest in statistical physics @xcite , being found , for example , in models of epidemics @xcite , catalytic kinetics @xcite , surface growth @xcite , and self - organized criticality @xcite .",
    "the best studied models of this kind , the contact process ( cp ) and directed percolation ( dp ) , are relevant to experiments on interface pinning @xcite and sand flow @xcite .",
    "the transition between active and absorbing states arises out of a conflict between two opposing processes ( e.g. , creation and annihilation ) ; when continuous ( as is often the case ) , it falls generically in the dp universality class @xcite .",
    "when two or more absorbing states exist and are connected by a symmetry operation , as in branching and annihilating random walks , the asymptotic dynamics is dominated by a domain - growth process , and a new kind of critical behavior appears @xcite .",
    "unusual critical behavior also appears in models that can become trapped in one of an infinite number of absorbing configurations ( inac ) .",
    "( more precisely , the number of absorbing configurations grows exponentially with the system size .",
    "there is no special symmetry linking the different absorbing configurations . )",
    "models of this sort were introduced to describe surface catalysis @xcite ; their critical properties have been studied in detail by various workers @xcite . in one dimension ,",
    "the pair contact process ( pcp ) @xcite , and other models with inac exhibit static critical behavior in the dp class @xcite , but the critical exponents @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath1 , associated with the spread of activity from a localized seed are _ nonuniversal _ , varying continuously with the particle density @xmath0 in the environment @xcite .",
    "[ these exponents are defined via the asymptotic ( @xmath7 ) power laws : survival probability @xmath8 , mean activity @xmath9 , and mean - square distance from the seed @xmath10 . ]",
    "this anomalous aspect of critical spreading for inac can be traced to a long memory in the dynamics of the order parameter , @xmath11 , arising from a coupling to an auxiliary field ( the local particle density , @xmath0 ) , that remains frozen in regions where @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "theoretical understanding of models with inac remains incomplete .",
    "muoz et al .",
    "were able to construct a plausible field theory ( a set of stochastic partial differential equations ) , for models with inac , and to show that the static critical behavior is that of dp @xcite . formally eliminating the auxiliary field",
    ", they obtained a closed equation for the order parameter , in which a memory term appears ; simulations of this theory reproduce the nonuniversal exponents observed in simulations of particle models @xcite . on the other hand , the phenomenon of nonuniversal spreading exponents has so far resisted analysis via renormalization group or other theoretical methods .",
    "studies of spreading in models with inac have yielded several clues toward understanding nonuniversality @xcite .",
    "first , the _ location _ of the critical point ( the critical parameter value , @xmath13 in the pcp ) , does not depend on @xmath0 , even as the exponents vary .",
    "second , the exponent @xmath1 , and the sum @xmath14 , are roughly independent of @xmath0 .",
    "third , the exponents @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath1 obey a generalized form of the hyperscaling relation derived by grassberger and de la torre for models with a unique absorbing configuration @xcite : @xmath15 for models with a unique absorbing configuration , the scaling relation @xmath16 holds , and one recovers the original hyperscaling relation @xcite .",
    "when the static critical behavior falls in the dp universality class , @xmath17 independent of @xmath0 ; in what follows we shall write eq .",
    "( [ ghypsc ] ) in the form @xmath18 .",
    "recently , dor et al . reported a weak dependence of @xmath13 on the particle density in the environment @xcite . in this work",
    "i describe extensive simulations of the pcp , using a recently - devised reweighting method @xcite , and improved data analysis .",
    "the results shed light on all three of the above - mentioned clues .",

    "jensen s pair contact process ( pcp ) @xcite , is an _ interacting particle system _ : a markov process whose state space is a set of particle configurations on a lattice @xcite .",
    "here we consider the one - dimensional version : each site of @xmath19 is either vacant or occupied .",
    "each nearest - neighbor ( nn ) pair of occupied sites (  particles \" ) has a rate @xmath20 of mutual annihilation , and a rate @xmath21 of attempted creation . in a creation event involving particles at sites @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    ", a new particle may appear ( with equal likelihood ) either at site @xmath24 or at @xmath25 , provided the chosen site is vacant .",
    "( attempts to place a new particle at an occupied site fail . ) in an annihilation event the sites occupied by a nn pair are simply vacated .",
    "the pcp exhibits an active phase for @xmath26 ; above this value the system falls into an absorbing configuration devoid of nn pairs , but that typically contains a substantial density , @xmath0 , of isolated particles .",
    "the most precise available estimate for the critical parameter is @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "( here and in what follows , numbers in parentheses denote an uncertainty estimate in the last figure or figures . ) note that the active regime corresponds to @xmath26 .",
    "previous studies leave little doubt that the static critical behavior of the pcp belongs to the universality class of directed percolation . jensen and",
    "dickman found that the critical exponents @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ( which govern , respectively , the stationary mean of , variance of , and initial decay of the order parameter ) , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( which govern the divergence of the correlation time and correlation length as one approaches the critical point ) , are all consistent with dp values @xcite .",
    "more recently , the order parameter moment ratios and cumulants were found to be the same as those of other models belonging to the dp universality class @xcite . the process of _ critical spreading _ ,",
    "i.e. , the propagation of initially localized activity in a system at the critical point , is more subtle .",
    "critical spreading in the pcp is studied by simulating the process at the critical point , with an initial condition generated by placing a single nn pair of particles ( the  seed \" ) into a configuration otherwise devoid of pairs . in this work , as in previous studies , the sites outside the seed bear a uniform particle density @xmath0 .",
    "( the particles may be placed in a random or a regular fashion . ) the critical point for spreading , @xmath33 , is defined operationally as the value for which the survival probability , mean number of pairs , and mean - square distance from the seed follow power laws .",
    "all earlier studies , except that of dor et al . , have found @xmath34 , independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the surprising result of the critical spreading studies is that only for a particular value of @xmath0 , the so - called _ natural density _",
    "@xmath35 , do the spreading exponents @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath1 assume dp values @xcite .",
    "the natural density is defined as the mean particle density in absorbing configurations generated by the process itself , at @xmath13 , starting from a homogeneous ( e.g. , fully occupied ) configuration .",
    "one may , equivalently , define @xmath35 as the particle density in the critical stationary state , in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "an environment with @xmath36 should favor spreading ( and one with @xmath37 should hinder it ) , since the higher the particle density in the environment , the more pairs will be formed per creation event .",
    "a kind of spreading phenomenon also arises in the stationary state due to spontaneous fluctuations . in the critical stationary state",
    ", we can expect to find inactive regions of all sizes ; the particle density in large inactive regions is @xmath35 .",
    "when activity spreads into such regions , it should follow the same scaling behavior as critical spreading with @xmath35 .",
    "since the exponents governing survival and growth of activity in the stationary state are subject to the scaling relations @xmath38 and @xmath39 , with @xmath28 , @xmath32 and @xmath31 taking dp values in the stationary state , it follows that the spreading exponents take their usual dp values as well , for @xmath40 . in an environment with @xmath41 ,",
    "the advance of the active region is no longer equivalent to the spread of activity in the stationary state , and the spreading exponents are not constrained to take dp values .",
    "of course , the interior of the active region must eventually relax to the critical stationary state , with a particle density @xmath35 , regardless of the exterior particle density @xmath0 .",
    "in simulations one finds that for @xmath37 the exponent @xmath5 is larger than the dp value , so that the survival probability decays more rapidly . @xmath6 and @xmath1 are smaller than the corresponding dp values , showing that diminishing the particle density hampers spreading , as expected .",
    "for @xmath36 these trends are reversed .",
    "the variations in @xmath5 and @xmath6 are quite dramatic : the former changes by more than a factor of four , and the latter by about two , as @xmath0 is varied between the extreme values of 0 and @xmath42 .",
    "the changes in @xmath1 and @xmath2 are much smaller , amounting to about 5% over the full range of @xmath0 ; it was suggested that the observed variations , which were not much larger than numerical uncertainties , could be attributed to corrections to scaling , suggesting the appealing simplification that @xmath1 and @xmath43 are in fact independent of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "since @xmath1 and @xmath14 have only to do with surviving trials ( the latter governs the growth in the number of pairs in such trials : @xmath44 ) , lack of dependence of these quantities on @xmath0 would imply that the latter only affects the survival probability , and not the asymptotic scaling of surviving trials .",
    "two observations should be made before discussing further details .",
    "first , the above pattern of scaling properties ( dp static behavior , nonuniversal exponents taking dp values only at the natural density , no apparent shift in @xmath13 , and near - constancy of @xmath1 and @xmath43 ) , has been confirmed in other one - dimensional models with inac ( the so - called dimer reaction @xcite , the threshold transfer process @xcite , and an evolution model with real - valued site variables @xcite ) , in models with a long memory of the initial configuration @xcite , and in a field theory intended to describe models with inac @xcite .",
    "second , spreading in two - dimensional models with inac appears to be more complex @xcite , and may not exhibit power - law scaling for all initial conditions @xcite , although the static critical behavior again falls in the dp class @xcite .",
    "how will shift in the critical point affect the spreading process ? before attempting an answer , it is helpful define the critical point with somewhat greater precision . in the pcp",
    "the _ bulk _ critical point @xmath13 is defined such that in the infinite - size limit , the stationary order parameter ( density of nn pairs ) is zero for @xmath45 ( subcritical regime ) and scales as @xmath46 for @xmath47 . now consider a spreading process , in which activity is initially localized ( for example , at a single nn pair in the pcp ) .",
    "the subcritical regime for spreading is defined as the set of @xmath20 values for which the survival probability @xmath48 as @xmath7 ; the critical value for spreading is then    @xmath49    in simulations , @xmath50 is identified as the value for which the survival probability , mean population @xmath51 , and mean - square spread @xmath52 all follow asymptotic power laws , which define the exponents @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath1 .",
    "( in the pcp , @xmath51 and @xmath53 refer to nn pairs ; in the simpler cp , of course , they represent the number and spread of particles .",
    "note that in the supercritical regime , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , that is , the finite fraction of trials that survive spread with a finite velocity , and have a finite bulk density . for @xmath56 , we expect a crossover from the exponents @xmath6 and @xmath1 at short times to the supercritical growth laws at longer times . )",
    "we are not aware of any proof that @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath1 follow power laws at @xmath50 .",
    "but it is known that in the cp , away from the critical point , the approach to the stationary state , be it active or absorbing , is exponential @xcite ; in some simpler cases , such as compact directed percolation , a power - law can be demonstrated explicitly @xcite .",
    "( on the other hand , the cp with quenched disorder appears to have a _",
    "logarithmic _ time - dependence at the critical point , and power - law away from the critical point @xcite ) . in any event",
    ", we shall assume that in the pcp , @xmath50 can be identified via the power - law criterion .",

    ", @xmath59 remains bounded as @xmath7 , while for @xmath63 it grows without bound .",
    "unbounded growth also obtains at @xmath50 if we assume that @xmath64 decays slower than exponentially at the critical point ( absenting a proof , we merely observe that exponential decay would be incompatible with scale - invariance ! ) .",

    "( that is , to compensate for the  hostile \" environment , the spreading critical point shifts to a value that lies in the bulk _ supercritical _ regime . )",
    "this means that for @xmath70 , the bulk is supercritical , but the spreading process always dies . at the critical point @xmath50 ,",
    "the spreading trials that do survive for long times have a nonzero bulk density @xmath71 ^{\\beta}$ ] , since the interior of the active region must eventually attain the stationary state . at long times , this interior region , having a finite density , makes the dominant contribution to @xmath72 and @xmath53 , implying that @xmath73 , which in turn implies the hyperscaling relation @xmath74 rather than eq .",

    "if so , then for @xmath77 , a surviving trial must have its activity concentrated in an annular region ( or at two fronts , in one dimension ) , since the order parameter vanishes in the bulk .",
    "( one may think of the activity as a  chemical wave \" that converts one kind of absorbing configuration , with @xmath36 , into another , with @xmath78 . ) in one dimension , moreover , the width of this active zone must grow fast enough that @xmath59 grows without bound as @xmath7 .    summarizing , if the critical point for spreading depends on the surrounding particle density ,",

    "most significantly , the definition @xmath175 involves the @xmath0-_dependent _ @xmath1 values listed in table i. were we to use , for example , the standard dp value @xmath176 in @xmath177 for @xmath132 we would find that @xmath178 approaches zero as @xmath7 .",
    "a similar analysis can be applied to the mean particle density @xmath179 in surviving trials . here",
    "@xmath179 is fixed at its initial value @xmath0 for @xmath180 , that is , outside the active region , and we expect @xmath181 to decay @xmath182 within the active region .",

    "( for @xmath40 , of course , this term vanishes . )",
    "the second term represents relaxation of the particle density to its natural value within the active region . to test this scaling hypothesis",

    "figures 11 , 12 , and 13 are scaling plots of @xmath185 for @xmath132 , 1/2 , and 0.242 , respectively .",
    "the data collapse confirms the observation of dor et al . that the particle density exhibits a power - law relaxation to its natural value , @xmath186 , within the active region @xcite",
    "we return to the three clues mentioned in the introduction .",
    "first our simulations , which are the most extensive ( in terms of sample size and trial duration ) , of the pcp to date , shows no evidence for a shift of the critical point with particle density .",
    "it is true ( see table i ) that our @xmath13 estimate for @xmath84 is slightly higher than that for @xmath132 , but the data for the three @xmath0 values studied show no systematic trend .",
    "in particular , our data do not confirm the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath13 is given as 0.07704 for @xmath187 and 0.07714 for @xmath188 ( and would presumably be at least as large , for @xmath84 ) , so that @xmath189 . here ,",
    "by contrast , we find @xmath190 , with an uncertainty of @xmath191 . to summarize , the present results are incompatible with the relatively large shift reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , but are quite compatible with there being no shift at all .    in figures 14 , 15 and 16",
    "we plot our results for the spreading exponents @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath1 as functions of @xmath0 , together with results from refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the overall consistency among these studies leaves little doubt that there is a systematic , roughly linear dependence of the exponents on the particle density .",
    "our results for the spreading exponents are sufficiently precise to rule out the proposal that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are independent of @xmath0 .",
    "while their variation is much smaller than that in @xmath5 or @xmath6 separately , there are significant changes , amounting to a relative variation of about 5% between the extremes @xmath132 and @xmath84 .",
    "the fact that @xmath1 varies with @xmath0 was confirmed in our scaling analysis of the activity profile . finally ,",
    "as shown in table i , the generalized hyperscaling relation is satisfied to within numerical uncertainty .",
    "given the variation in @xmath1 , a compensating variation in @xmath14 is needed for hyperscaling to hold .",
    "that @xmath2 and @xmath1 depend on @xmath0 forces us to abandon what seemed an attractive simplifying hypothesis : the environment affects not only the likelihood of survival , but ( to a lesser extent ) the scaling properties of trials that do survive .",
    "can we understand nonuniversal spreading in models with inac ?",
    "thus far , attempts to identify a marginal parameter in a renormalization group analysis of the pcp and allied models have not borne fruit . nonuniversality does appear to be associated with a long memory , due to the slow relaxation of an auxiliary field coupled to the order parameter .",
    "such a memory term appears in a field theory that successfully predicts the static critical behavior of the pcp @xcite , and that reproduces ( numerically ) nonuniversal spreading @xcite .",
    "moreover , varying exponents have been observed in one - dimensional models with a unique absorbing configuration and a slowly - relaxing memory of the initial condition @xcite . explaining the nonuniversality of the spreading exponents , and predicting their values as a function of the particle density , remain as theoretical challenges .",
