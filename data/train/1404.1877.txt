    "in @xcite the authors have studied spectral measures for fundamental representations of the rank two lie groups @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . the spectral measure of an operator is a particular compactly supported probability measure on the spectrum of that operator .",

    "we will mean the spectral measure of ( the adjacency matrix of ) such a fusion graph .",
    "in particular , the joint spectral measure for the two fundamental representations of the rank two lie group were studied .",
    "the joint spectral measure has support given by the joint spectrum @xmath12 of the operators given by the adjacency matrices @xmath13 of the representation graphs for the two fundamental representations @xmath14 of @xmath11 .",
    "the pushforward of these joint spectral measures under the projection on the spectrum @xmath15 of a single fundamental representation @xmath16 then yields the spectral measure for @xmath16 on @xmath15 .",
    "since these groups have rank two , these spectral measures can also be defined as measures over the two - torus @xmath3 ( which is isomorphic to the maximal torus of the rank two lie group ) .",
    "the characters of the fundamental representations define a surjection from @xmath3 to the joint spectrum @xmath12 , which is invariant under the action of the weyl group @xmath17 of @xmath11 on the torus .",
    "the jacobian for the change of variables from @xmath3 to @xmath12 clearly plays a key role in the spectral measures for @xmath11 over both @xmath3 and the joint spectrum .",

    "one considers the verlinde algebra at a finite level @xmath18 , represented by a non - degenerately braided system @xmath19 of irreducible endomorphisms on a type @xmath20 factor @xmath21 , whose fusion rules @xmath22 reproduce exactly those of the positive energy representations of the loop group of the lie group @xmath11 at level @xmath18 , @xmath23 .",
    "the statistics generators @xmath24 , @xmath25 obtained from the braided tensor category @xmath19 match exactly those of the kac - peterson modular @xmath24 , @xmath25 matrices which perform the conformal character transformations @xcite ( see also footnote 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the fusion graph for these irreducible endomorphisms are truncated versions of the representation graphs of @xmath11 itself .",

    "the joint spectrum of the nimrep graphs for the fundamental generators of the system @xmath19 is again contained in the joint spectrum @xmath12 of @xmath11 .",

    "the next block consists of the products of @xmath108 and @xmath40 ( excluding @xmath8 which was included in the first block ) .",
    "note that @xmath109 is semisimple , but @xmath3 is not usually regarded as semisimple since it is abelian .",

    "the dashed line separates the lie groups for which the weyl group @xmath105 do not already appear in the first two blocks , and those for which @xmath110 does appear .",
    "the latter lie groups are not considered in this paper .    in the final block",
    "we have listed non - connected compact rank two lie groups .",
    "we do not list lie groups which are products @xmath111 where @xmath11 is a compact , connected rank two lie group and @xmath112 is an arbitrary finite group , as the weyl group in this case is just @xmath110 , the weyl group for @xmath11 , and its group of connected components is @xmath112 .",
    "the only semidirect product @xmath113 , @xmath55 , which appears in this list is for @xmath114 .",

    "thus the semidirect product @xmath113 reduces to a product of @xmath3 ( or @xmath118 ) by some @xmath119 . finally , for the last two groups listed , the @xmath93-action interchanges the two components in the product .    in this paper",
    "we determine spectral measures associated to the compact connected rank two lie groups listed in the first three blocks , as these are sufficient to exhaust all finite subgroups of @xmath4 , up to conjugation in @xmath4 . for our purposes",

    "the irreducible characters and corresponding representation graphs will be constructed in the proceeding sections from knowledge of @xmath55 . for one of the groups @xmath11 contained in the fourth block in table [ table : lie - weyl ] ,",
    "one could obtain the spectral measures in this case by considering its corresponding covering group @xmath112 in the first two blocks , and determining the spectral measures for representation graphs corresponding to those irreducible representations of @xmath112 which are fundamental generators ( see section [ sect : representation_graphs ] ) of @xmath11 .",
    "such spectral measures will not be determined in this paper .",
    "the framework used here , which is described in sections [ sect : orbit_functions]-[sect : measures - different_domains ] , can not be used for subgroups @xmath120 , since a fundamental domain @xmath68 of @xmath69 is not uniquely defined .",
    "it is still possible to associate a graph @xmath31 , and hence a spectral measure , to @xmath41 .",
    "one way of doing this is described in remark [ rem : z2 ^ 1=2.d4 ^ 1 ] for the case of @xmath121 .",
    "however the joint spectrum @xmath122 of the graph @xmath31 is equal to the joint spectrum of @xmath123 , and the spectral measure over @xmath122 is twice that for @xmath124 .",
    "similar statements can be made for the other subgroups @xmath120 , with the spectral measure over the joint spectrum @xmath122 for @xmath41 being twice that for the corresponding dihedral group @xmath125 .",
