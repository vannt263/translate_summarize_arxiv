    "the standard model of quark flavour physics has successfully passed all experimental tests to date .",
    "this includes the observation of a substantial number of rare processes and cp asymmetries , which are consistently accounted for within the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) description of quark mixing . on the other hand , many essential features of the standard model , most notably in the flavour sector , are still not satisfactorily understood on a more fundamental level .",
    "deviations from standard expectations , which could guide us towards a better understanding , appear to be small in general in view of the basic agreement between theory and observations . in this situation precision tests of flavour physics become increasingly important , which motivates current efforts to build a super flavour factory @xcite .",
    "such a facility will enable an exciting program in @xmath4 physics @xcite .",
    "one of the best opportunities in this respect could be provided by the study of @xmath5 transitions , induced by interactions at very short distances .",
    "theoretically ideal would be an inclusive measurement of @xmath6 , where the hadronic matrix element can be accurately computed using the heavy - quark expansion .",
    "unfortunately , because of the missing neutrinos , an inclusive experimental determination of the decay rate is probably unfeasible .",
    "more promising is the measurement of exclusive channels such as @xmath0 , @xmath7 . in this case",
    "a clean theoretical interpretation requires , however , the control of nonperturbative hadronic form factors . direct calculations of form factors suffer from sizable uncertainties .",
    "additional experimental input to eliminate nonperturbative quantities can therefore be very useful .",
    "important examples are the related decays @xmath8 , where the hadronic matrix element can be eliminated with the help of @xmath9 using isospin symmetry . as discussed in @xcite , a similar role could be played by the semileptonic mode @xmath10 for the rare decay @xmath0 .",
    "this strategy is limited by the breaking of @xmath11 flavour symmetry of the strong interaction , which is also difficult to estimate with high accuracy .",
    "in this paper we propose to perform a combined analysis of the rare decays @xmath0 and @xmath12 .",
    "as we shall discuss , this option has several advantages for controlling hadronic uncertainties .",
    "it allows us to construct precision observables for testing the standard model and for investigating new physics effects .",
    "in particular neither isospin nor @xmath11 flavour symmetry are required and form factor uncertainties can be eliminated to a large extent .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 summarizes the experimental status .",
    "section 3 collects basic theoretical results .",
    "it includes a discussion of @xmath13 form factors , weak annihilation and nonperturbative corrections in @xmath1 , and the background for @xmath14 from @xmath15 .",

    "independently of such theory constraints we might ultimately want to extract the form factor shape from experimental data . in this spirit , we have investigated how well different values of @xmath133 fit the current belle measurements of the dilepton - mass spectrum in @xmath1 . for this purpose",

    "the central value amounts to about @xmath98 of the short - distance branching fraction ( [ bnnnum ] ) . a subtraction of ( [ bkgrsm ] ) from the measured branching ratio",

    ", the background subtraction will then lead to an error of only about @xmath154 in @xmath147 .",
    "we conclude that the background from @xmath15 pointed out in @xcite has to be taken into account for a precise measurement of the short - distance branching fraction @xmath147 .",
    "it needs to be subtracted from the experimental signal , but this should ultimately be possible with essentially negligible uncertainty .",

    "for the neutrino mode we find @xmath157 we have displayed the sensitivity to the form factor parameters , which are by far the dominant sources of uncertainty .",

    "the fully integrated , non - resonant @xmath33 branching fraction can be evaluated in a similar way .",
    "this quantity corresponds essentially to the experimental result in ( [ kllexp ] ) , which has been obtained by cutting out the large background from the two narrow charmonium resonances and by extrapolating the measurements to the entire @xmath20 range to recover the total non - resonant rate . the precise correspondence between theoretical and experimental results will depend on the details of the cuts and the extrapolation procedure .",
    "we will treat the resonance region more carefully later when we study precision observables . for our present discussion",
    "we simply identify the integral over the non - resonant spectrum in ( [ dbkllds ] ) with the measurement in ( [ kllexp ] ) .",
    "this appears justified as the error from this identification is expected to be below the experimental uncertainty . adopting these considerations we compute @xmath158 in addition to the still dominant dependence on the form factor we have in this case a non - negligible perturbative uncertainty , which we estimate in the standard way through a variation of the scale @xmath159 between @xmath160 and @xmath161 around the reference value of @xmath91 .",
    "the scale dependence is at a rather moderate level of @xmath162 with nlo accuracy , much smaller than the error from the hadronic parameters . within sizeable ,",
    "mainly theoretical uncertainties , the prediction ( [ bllnum ] ) is in agreement with the measurement in ( [ kllexp ] ) .",
    "whereas the individual branching fractions ( [ bnnnum ] ) and ( [ bllnum ] ) suffer from large hadronic uncertainties , we expect their ratio to be under much better theoretical control .",
    "it is obvious that the form factor normalization @xmath106 cancels in this ratio .",
    "moreover , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bkllnn ] ,    [ t]@xmath22 [ b]@xmath163    the shape of the @xmath20 spectrum is almost identical for the two modes .",
    "this is because the additional @xmath20-dependence from charm loops in @xmath1 , compared to @xmath0 , is numerically only a small effect outside the region of the narrow charmonium states . as a consequence ,",
    "also the dependence on the form factor shape will be greatly reduced in the ratio @xmath164 numerically we find @xmath165 this prediction is independent of form factor uncertainties for all practical purposes .",
    "it is limited essentially by the perturbative uncertainty at nlo of @xmath162 .",
    "using the experimental result in ( [ kllexp ] ) , the theory prediction ( [ rnum ] ) , and assuming the validity of the standard model , we obtain @xmath166 with an accuracy of @xmath167 , limited at present by the experimental error , this result is currently the most precise estimate of @xmath147 .    since isospin breaking effects in the decay rates are very small , the branching ratios for the decays @xmath168 and @xmath169 are given by the branching ratios for the corresponding @xmath18 modes multiplied by a factor of @xmath170 .      in order to obtain theoretically clean observables , the region of the two narrow charmonium resonances @xmath171 and @xmath172 has to be removed from the @xmath20 spectrum of @xmath1 .",
    "this leaves two regions of interest , the low-@xmath22 region below the resonances , and the high-@xmath22 region above . for the present analysis",
    "we define these ranges as @xmath173 the resonance region @xmath174 corresponds to the @xmath20 range @xmath175 . for",
    "our standard parameter set the total rate for @xmath0 or @xmath1 ( non - resonant ) is divided among the three regions , low-@xmath22 , narrow - resonance , high-@xmath22 , as @xmath176 .",
    "we first concentrate on the low-@xmath22 region , where @xmath177 can be reliably calculated .",
    "to ensure an optimal cancellation of the form factor dependence , one may restrict also the neutrino mode to the same range in @xmath22 and define @xmath178 this ratio is determined by theory to very high precision . displaying the sensitivity to the shape parameters and the renormalization scale",
    "one finds @xmath179 the form factor dependence is seen to cancel almost perfectly in @xmath180 .",
    "the shape parameters affect this quantity at a level of only 0.5 per mille .",
    "one is therefore left with the perturbative uncertainty , estimated here at about @xmath181 at nlo .",
    "the independence of any form factor uncertainties in @xmath180 comes at the price of using only @xmath182 of the full @xmath14 rate .",
    "we therefore consider a different ratio , which is defined by @xmath183 in this ratio the fully integrated rate of @xmath14 is divided by the integrated rate of @xmath177 with only the narrow - resonance region removed .",
    "this ensures use of the maximal statistics in both channels . due to the missing region in @xmath177 the dependence on the form factor shape",
    "will no longer be eliminated completely , but we still expect a reduced dependence .",
    "numerically we obtain , using the same input as before , @xmath184 this estimate shows that the uncertainty from @xmath104 and @xmath105 is indeed very small , at a level of about @xmath185 . with better empirical information on the shape of the spectrum",
    "this could be further improved .",
    "we conclude that ratios such as those in ( [ r25def ] ) and ( [ r256def ] ) , or similar quantities with modified cuts , are theoretically very well under control .",
    "they are therefore ideally suited for testing the standard model with high precision .      until now our strategy has been to achieve accurate predictions by eliminating the form factor dependence altogether .",
    "a variant of our analysis consists in taking a single hadronic parameter , the form factor at one particular value of @xmath20 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 , as additional theory input .",
    "the shape of the form factor can be fitted to the experimental spectrum as discussed in sec .",

    "the form factor parametrization used here is completely sufficient .",

    "using the best - fit shape parameters @xmath192 and @xmath193 we obtain @xmath194 where the first error is from the measured branching ratio in ( [ kllexp ] ) and the second error is from scale dependence .",
    "the sensitivity to the shape parameters is comparable to the uncertainty from the branching ratio .    unlike the parameters @xmath104 and @xmath105 , the value of @xmath186 determined in this way , assuming the standard model , is sensitive to the normalization of the branching ratio and therefore to new physics effects .",

    "the subject of new physics in @xmath5 transitions has been discussed in @xcite and most recently in @xcite .",
    "new physics in @xmath12 has been studied in @xcite , including the information from angular distributions .",
    "in this paper we have studied precision tests of the standard model through a combined analysis of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the main points can be summarized as follows :    * after removing the narrow - resonance region the branching fraction of @xmath1 can be reliably computed .",
    "the dominant amplitude from semileptonic operators is simply a calculable expression times the form factor @xmath81 .",
    "qcd factorization for low @xmath20 and ope for high @xmath20 allow one to treat also matrix elements of 4-quark operators in a systematic way .",
    "these are dominated by charm loops , which are numerically small contributions to begin with .",
    "since the tensor form factor @xmath83 can be related to @xmath81 in the heavy - quark limit , the entire @xmath1 amplitude becomes calculable in terms of practically a single hadronic quantity , the form factor @xmath99 . *",
    "the decay mode @xmath0 is a particularly clean process .",
    "it is completely determined by short - distance physics at the weak scale up to the same form factor @xmath99 . for the charged mode",
    "the background due to @xmath15 should be subtracted from the experimental signal , but this will be possible without introducing any appreciable uncertainty . *",
    "the form factor uncertainty can be eliminated by constructing suitable ratios of ( partially ) integrated rates such as @xmath180 in ( [ r25def ] ) and @xmath197 in ( [ r256def ] ) .",
    "the resulting quantities can be computed with high accuracy .",
    "the cancellation of form factors is exact and does not require the use of approximate flavour symmetries . * the perturbative uncertainty of the ratios is estimated to be @xmath181 at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "this can be further improved by a nnlo analysis along the lines of @xcite .",
    "uncertainties from other sources are at the level of several percent",
    ". some refinements in controlling them should still be possible . *",
    "based on the current measurements of @xmath156 we predict @xmath207 at present the most accurate estimate of this quantity .",
    "* the ratios of @xmath0 and @xmath1 rates have an interesting sensitivity to new physics .",
    "the new physics reach benefits from the high accuracy of the standard model predictions .",
    "a complementary new physics test is possible based on @xmath1 alone , exploiting experimental information on the @xmath20 spectrum , if @xmath81 at one particular value of @xmath20 is used as input from lattice qcd . * new physics in the wilson",
    "coefficients factorizes from low - energy hadronic physics in a simple way . the latter is essentially contained only in @xmath81",
    ". our analysis can thus be generalized to specific new physics scenarios in a straightforward manner .",
    "our proposal puts @xmath0 as a new physics probe in the same class as @xmath8 , the ` golden modes ' of kaon physics . @xmath0 together with @xmath1 thus hold exciting opportunities for @xmath4 physics at a super flavour factory .",
    "the three form factors in ( [ fpf0def ] ) and ( [ ftdef ] ) , @xmath208 , @xmath99 , and @xmath209 or equivalently @xmath210\\frac{m^2_b - m^2_k}{q^2}\\ ] ] are related in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "if we multiply ( [ fpf0def ] ) and ( [ ftdef ] ) by @xmath211 and use the equation of motion for the heavy quark , @xmath212 , we find @xmath213 similarly , multiplying ( [ fpf0def ] ) with @xmath214 , using @xmath212 , and comparing the result with @xmath215 ( [ fpf0def ] ) , where the quark equations of motion are used on the left - hand side , one finds @xmath216 together ( [ ftfpfm ] ) and ( [ fpfm ] ) imply @xmath217 the relations ( [ ftfpfm ] )  ( [ ftfphql ] ) have been obtained in @xcite in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "they apply immediately to the case where the kaon is soft , since then the heavy - quark mass is the only large energy scale in the problem . on the other hand , the derivation makes no explicit reference to the kaon energy and it has been argued in @xcite that these relations should be valid in the entire kinematic domain .",
    "this conjecture can be justified within the framework of soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite , using the form factor relations in the large recoil limit @xcite , which also lead to ( [ ftfpfm ] )  ( [ ftfphql ] ) .",
    "a related discussion can be found in @xcite",
    ".    we may thus use ( [ ftfphql ] ) in the entire range of @xmath20 between @xmath93 and @xmath218 . since",
    "this expression for @xmath87 is an asymptotic result in the heavy - quark limit @xmath219 , an important issue is the question of subleading terms .",
    "these can be power corrections in @xmath220 and perturbative qcd corrections .",
    "the perturbative corrections were computed in the heavy - quark and large recoil energy limit in @xcite with the result ( in the ndr scheme with @xmath54 subtraction ) @xmath221 \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\frac{\\alpha_s(\\mu_h ) c_f}{4\\pi}\\frac{4\\pi^2 f_b f_k}{n f_+(s)e_k\\lambda_b } \\int_0 ^ 1du\\,\\frac{\\phi_k(u)}{1-u}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 , @xmath222 , and @xmath223 depends on @xmath85 through ( [ q2rel ] ) .",
    "we note that this relation remains valid when the kaon is soft , with @xmath224 . in that case expression ( [ ftfpas ] ) simplifies .",
    "the term with @xmath225 is no longer perturbative since the effective scale @xmath226 becomes soft .",
    "however , the entire term is power suppressed @xmath227 because @xmath228 and @xmath229 .",
    "the second term in square brackets is also power suppressed and only the first correction @xmath230 survives .",
    "the @xmath90 corrections can be consistently taken into account at nnlo even though at present , for low @xmath20 , the second term from hard spectator interactions still introduces an uncertainty of about @xmath231  @xmath232 .",
    "power corrections to the heavy - quark limit are more difficult to compute .",
    "an estimate can be obtained from light - cone qcd sum rules @xcite , which indicate that @xmath87 deviates from @xmath233 by less than @xmath181 for @xmath234 .",
    "the sum rule calculations include @xmath90 corrections within their framework .    from these considerations",
    "we conclude that the relation ( [ ftfphql ] ) should be correct to within @xmath235 .",
    "weak annihilation contributes to @xmath236 through qcd penguin operators .",
    "these induce the transition @xmath237 where the valence quarks @xmath238 of the @xmath239 meson are annihilated and transformed into the constituents of the final state @xmath240 .",
    "the virtual photon producing the lepton pair may be emitted from any of the four quarks in this transition . in a similar manner",
    "the process @xmath241 gives rise to weak annihilation in @xmath156 , where the transition comes from qcd penguins and from doubly cabibbo suppressed tree operators .",
    "to be specific we treat the case of @xmath236 first . here",
    "the leading - power contribution to weak annihilation comes from the qcd penguin operators @xmath242 the ellipsis refers to similar terms with @xmath243 replaced by @xmath244 , @xmath245 , @xmath22 and @xmath246 , which do not contribute at the order we are considering .",
    "colour indices are denoted by @xmath247 , @xmath248 .",
    "the kinematics of the annihilation process is conveniently described in terms of two lightlike four - vectors @xmath249 .",
    "their components can be chosen , without loss of generality , as @xmath250 the momenta of the @xmath4 meson , the kaon and the lepton pair , @xmath251 , @xmath252 and @xmath253 , respectively , can then be written as @xmath254 for now we assume that the dilepton mass @xmath20 counts as order @xmath255 , appropriate for the low-@xmath20 region .",
    "this means that momentum @xmath253 is nearly lightlike and approximately in the direction of @xmath256 , whereas @xmath252 is lightlike and has the direction of @xmath257 if we neglect the kaon mass .",
    "consider next the @xmath237 annihilation diagram where the virtual photon is emitted from the @xmath258 in the initial state .",
    "we will denote by @xmath259 the contribution of this diagram to the @xmath236 matrix element of @xmath260 .",
    "viewed as a function of the @xmath258 four - momentum @xmath261 , the diagram has the form @xmath262 up to terms with a relative power suppression in @xmath263 .",
    "the momentum @xmath264 is decomposed into light - cone coordinates @xmath265 and @xmath266 , @xmath267 , with respect to the two vectors @xmath249 in ( [ npmdef ] ) .",
    "the expression for the light - cone projector of the @xmath4 meson in momentum space , appropriate for an amplitude of the type shown in ( [ flplus ] ) , has been derived in @xcite .",
    "it is given by @xmath268\\gamma_5\\ ] ] the derivative in ( [ bdbarl ] ) extracts the @xmath269 contribution in ( [ flplus ] ) .",
    "after it has been applied , @xmath266 has to be set to zero and @xmath270 is identified with @xmath271 .    calculating the contribution @xmath259 with the projector in ( [ bdbarl ] ) we find @xmath272\\ ] ] here",
    "@xmath273 is the lepton current in momentum space and @xmath274 the down - quark charge .",
    "the second term in ( [ ad1 ] ) is of the same order in @xmath263 as the first term .",
    "it has a pole in @xmath20 and is inconsistent with electromagnetic gauge invariance .",
    "however , it is structure independent ( it depends only on @xmath144 , @xmath275 , not on the distribution amplitudes ) and is cancelled by corresponding contributions from the remaining three diagrams .",
    "these diagrams , where the photon is emitted from the @xmath246 quark , the @xmath22 quark and the final - state @xmath258 quark ( @xmath276 ) give explicitly @xmath277 as contributions to the matrix element of @xmath260 .",
    "charge conservation implies that @xmath278 , which guarantees the cancellation of the @xmath279 term in ( [ ad1 ] ) by ( [ absd2 ] ) .",
    "the first term in ( [ ad1 ] ) then leads to the result ( [ da9wa34 ] ) once the matrix element of @xmath280 is included , which is the same as the one of @xmath260 up to a factor @xmath281 from colour .",
    "we remark that the @xmath279 term and half of the first term in ( [ ad1 ] ) come from the @xmath269 part in ( [ flplus ] ) .",
    "the latter contribution , as well as all @xmath279 terms are absent at leading power for weak annihilation in @xmath282 @xcite , in contrast to the present case .    the result in ( [ da9wa34 ] ) develops a logarithmic singularity when @xmath20 becomes soft of order @xmath283 , corresponding to the formal limit @xmath284 .",
    "since the singularity is integrable , the soft region is power suppressed in comparison to the branching ratio integrated from @xmath93 to @xmath285 , as has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the annihilation contribution in ( [ da9wa56 ] ) from operators @xmath286 and @xmath287 is obtained in analogy to the case of @xmath280 , @xmath260 .",
    "also for @xmath288 , @xmath289 there are structure - independent terms @xmath290 , which cancel when all four diagrams are added .",
    "the remaining result is again due to the diagram where the photon is emitted from the @xmath258 quark in the initial state .",
