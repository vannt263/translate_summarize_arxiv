    "it is well - known that each of the transport processes in fluids , namely , diffusion , heat transfer , momentum transfer due to shearing motion , and chemical reaction is enhanced by the presense of turbulence .",
    "the physical origin that causes such appreciable hike in those rates is the fractal nature of turbulence@xcite : it is ascribed to drastic increase in net contact area of adjacent bulk of fluid , taking place through the bounding surface penetrating into each other area , thereby making it easier to transport mass , momentum and energy .",
    "it results in drag rise of a flat plate several times@xcite the laminar counterpart , also in flame propagation velocity elevated by a few ten times@xcite under internal combustion engine environment(fig.1 ) .",
    "obviously the latter is a favorable facet of turbulence characteristies , whereas the former is detrimental from the viewpoint of transport vehicle technologies .",
    "in fact , the evidence that the rate increase due to turbulence is much higher for mechanism generating thrust rather than drag tempts us to imagine a midget planet where airplanes would have to install disproportionally huge engines , under the environment of _ no _ turbulence .",
    "thus chemical reaction rates , among other transport processes , must be influenced by turbulence most sensitively , so is worth looking into most detail .",
    "in general there are two aspects of approach to this problem : the one is to pursue the instantaneous value of a physical quantity @xmath0 which is stochastic and fractal , using direct numerical simulation ( dns ) for example . in principle , any of these quantities are described in terms of microscopic density advocated by klimontovich@xcite , which we will call hereafter the k - formalism .",
    "the dns currently being used in numerical simulation of fluid flows is the macroscopic version of the k - formalism@xcite .",
    "it has been applied to problems of combustion science , enabling to compute wiggling premixed flame front with sufficient resolvability@xcite .",
    "the state of the art , however , is yet to go far to be able to provide information such as turbulent flame speed for engine designers .",
    "another approach to turbulent combustion is based on an axiom of statistical mechanics that claims equivalence of solving for instantaneous value @xmath0 of a stochastic quantity and for a set of averaged quantities @xmath1 in the above @xmath2 is the average value , @xmath3 is the instantaneous fluctuation subject to @xmath4 , and fluctuation correlations @xmath5 etc .",
    ", refer to those between different points in the independent variable @xmath6 , etc .",
    "the second formalism is the basis on which to found statistical mechanics for example ; in fact , if one identifies @xmath0 with the microscopic density , then its average @xmath7 represents boltzmann s function .",
    "so the latter may well be called b - formalism as contrast to the k - formalism as defined above .",
    "a flow of turbulent gas is _ dually _ stochastic ; the one is microscopic ( molecular ) level with the average taken with respect to the molecular velocity , whereas the other is macroscopic ( fluid - dynamic ) level where the average is taken over a volumelet whose size is greater than the kolmogorov scale yet smaller than fluid - dynamic characteristic length .",
    "if one identifies @xmath7 with chemical reaction rate , there are three levels of descriptions : following the k - formalism @xmath0 is expressed as a sum of on - off step functions depending on whether each molecular collision clears the potential barrier to effect inelastic collisions@xcite .",
    "next level is the classical b - formalism where the molecular average alone is employed .",
    "then @xmath7 is shown to be expressed as arrhenius law@xcite .",
    "it is coupled with fractal analysis to estimate turbulent flame surface area to evaluate turbulent burning rate@xcite . the third stage , namely , the b - formalism to be discussed here is intended to encompass both molecular and turbulent averaging procedures in its framework .",
    "a series of earlier works along this line@xcite has shed some light on the conflicts between the classical arrhenius kinetics and experimental data attributable to temperature turbulence using the exact solution that represents simplified reality . in fig.2 is shown shock - tube data of low - temperature ( spotty ) ignition of hydrogen oxygen premixture as compared with the classical theory ( @xmath8 ) , also with turbulence - corrected one , a primitive form@xcite of the present theory .",
    "also is shown in fig.3 flame velocity of turbulent premixed gas@xcite as compared with existing experiment and with renormalization group theory .",
    "although the earlier theory has thus enabled to predict some features of turbulent combustion as to their dependence on turbulent intensity without relying on any empirical parameters , no information has been provided regarding their dependence on the scale of turbulence .",
    "revised version in the basic formalism has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , with applications to nonreactive turbulence , where full informations on the scale of turbulence have been made available .",
    "the objective of this paper is three - fold : the one is to show the exact solution for turbulent equilibrium still valid even without the condition of only temperature turbulence prevalent . the other is to remodel the previous theory so as to include scale of turbulence into formalism for reactive flows now at issue .",
    "the third is to show that the b - formalism , an average - oriented formalism , provides a sound description of turbulent combustion if based on turbulent equilibrium , which otherwise has been considered as out - of - date .",
    "in paralled with the classical kinetic theory providing molecular basis of nonturbulent fluid dynamics , molecular description of gases based on the microscopic density @xmath9 has given the ground for the direct numerical simulation of turbulent gases@xcite . in the above expression",
    ", @xmath10 is a point in the phase space , namely , physical ( @xmath11 ) plus molecular velocity ( @xmath12 ) space , and @xmath13 denotes the ( 6d ) delta function .",
    "this function gives , by definition , the instantaneous number density in the phase space , so is identified with unaveraged boltzmann function . it was first applied to the plasma kinetic theory@xcite where the equation governing @xmath14 is vlasov s equation .",
    "for monatomic ( neutral ) ideal gases , the governing equation , derived as an equation of continuity in the phase space with precise spatial and temporal resolvability of hamiltonian mechanics level , proves to be an unaveraged boltzmann equation@xcite @xmath15 = 0\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the classical collision integral operator @xmath17 = \\left [ \\int ( f'{\\widetilde{f}}'-f{\\widetilde{f}})v\\,d\\omega\\,d{\\widetilde{{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$v$ } } } } } \\right]_{{\\widetilde{{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$x$}}}}}={\\mbox{\\boldmath{$x$}}}}\\ ] ] in the above @xmath18 is the microscopic density of the collision partner molecule @xmath19 , @xmath20 likewise with @xmath21 specifying the pre - collision state of the collision partner leading to @xmath19 after the collision , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the differential collision - cross section of the molecular encounter .",
    "the microscopic density , being averaged over a space with a number of unidentifiable molecules included , defines the boltzmann function @xmath24 ; @xmath25 this is where the statistical concept is introduced for a quantity of deterministic mechanics .",
    "similarly , two - point correlation function @xmath26 is defined using the same averaging concept as @xmath27 higher order correlations can be defined likewise .    the classical kinetic theory is founded on eq.(4 ) averaged over the same space as ( 6 ) together with the boltzmann s ( binary ) molecular chaos hypothesis @xmath28 that is the boltzmann equation in the classical sense ; @xmath29 = 0\\ ] ] under the equilibrium condition ( @xmath30 ) the equation reduces to @xmath31=0\\ ] ] whose solution is known as the maxwellian distribution @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the number density , fluid velocity and temperature , @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the universal gas constant and molar weight , respectively .    if a gas is turbulent , fluid variables exhibit ( long - range ) correlations , so the classical binary chaos ( 8) ceases to hold .",

    "it is a well - posed problem to seek the equilibrium solution of the new set of equations ( 12 ) and ( 17 ) .",

    "the point at issue , however , is that they differ appreciably in the population of high energy molecules that play a crucial role in chemical reactions , particularly when the activation energy is high . in fig.4",
    "is shown the population density of molecules having absolute molecular velocity @xmath80 with turbulence only in the temperature .",
    "the maxwellian distribution @xmath81 is seen to have lean high energy tail , namely , underestimates population of high energy molecules compared to reality of turbulence .",
    "instantaneous reaction rates for respective species are expressed in the following form , @xmath106 utilizing the following formula @xmath107 and transforming integral variables from @xmath108 to @xmath109 defined by @xmath110 we have for ( 33 ) @xmath111 where @xmath112 denotes the critical relative velocity for a head - on collision .",
    "chemical reaction rate in classical sense is obtained from ( 39 ) , upon averaging and employing classical chaos ( 8) , as @xmath113 if the maxwellian equilibrium ( 11 ) is employed eq.(41 ) is integrated out to give @xmath114 that is nothing but arrhenius law ( 34 ) with activation energy @xmath89 and the frequency factor @xmath88 written in microscopic parameters .",
    "it should be noted that turbulence counterpart of the above deduction faces with difficulty if conducted phenomenologically , whereas it is simply straightforward if one follows the molecular approach as employed here .",
    "in fact , if one assumes that the instantaneous reaction rate is arrhenius form ( 34 ) @xmath115 and its average given by @xmath116 decomposing the r.h.s .",
    "term under average into means and fluctuations we have @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the zeldovich number and @xmath119 stands for the temperature fluctuation .",
    "leading term in the taylor expansion of the expression under average sign gives for @xmath120 , @xmath121 which implies that convergence of the series is extremely slow since the zeldovich number for combustion reaction is of @xmath122 .",
    "for example we need to take 23 terms before @xmath123 diminishes to unity for @xmath124 .",
    "it also means that we need to know 22 consecutive self correlations in the temperature fluctuation .",
    "needless to say , therefore , that the first term ( arrhenius ) or a few - term approximation is far from satisfactory .    on the other hand ,",
    "if one adopts microscopic approach , namely , starts with the averaged version of ( 39 ) insted of ( 43 ) ; @xmath125 and employs turbulent equilibrium ( 33 ) for @xmath126 , a simple calculation leads immediately to the final expression @xmath127 with @xmath128 where @xmath129 has been defined by ( 42 ) .",
    "formula ( 45 ) for the turbulent reaction rate turns out to be a bimodal arrhenius : it allows us to draw a intuitive picture that a half of the chemical reaction takes place under temperature elevated and population of reactant molecules denser by their root - mean - square turbulent intensity , and another half under those quantities lowered by the same amount .",
    "the bimodal arrhenius low ( 45 ) is the full turbulence version derived on the basis of exact solution of eqs .",
    "( 24 ) and ( 25 ) , supplementing the previous one@xcite , where turbulence prevails only in the temperature .",
    "as already sketched it is obvious that anomalous increase in the reaction rate is overwhelmingly due to the temperature turbulence that feeds extra high energy molecules capable of reaction ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "the first term of ( 45 ) looks as if the potential barrier is lowered by the factor of @xmath130 ; a macroscopic equivalent of tunnelling effect of quantum mechanics where the potential barrier is lowered by a factor of planck s constant due to the uncertainty principle .",
    "on the other hand , fluctuation in the reactant number density does not have such effects on the reaction rate beyond the first order smallness .",
    "however , when coupled with the temperature effect , it leaves with a possible account for below - critical lean combustion that actually occurs in the operation of the direct injection engines ( gdi ) .",
    "rate law ( 45 ) also tells us that turbulence in the fluid velocity has no influence on the reaction rate ( as it should not ) .",
    "in fact , the collision integral for a pair of molecules about to collide are not influenced by the fluctuation in the fluid velocity , because they are aboard on the ` same boat ' in the turbulent ocean .",
    "its effects on turbulent flame velocity are exclusively via other transport processes , namely , turbulent diffusion and turbulent heat transfer .",
    "( see table 1 , next section ) .",
    "it is an experimental evidence that instantaneous chemical reaction rate @xmath131 at a fixed point undergoes fluctuation over a wide range , therefore , quality of a statistical theory employing any average concepts hinges crucially on reliable estimate for its variance around the average @xmath7 .",
    "this issue again is beyond the reach of phenomenologies and we have to address to statistical approach as developed in the preceding section . to be remarked at this point",
    "is that what appear in the governing equations are not the variance itself , but the fluctuation correlations @xmath132 where @xmath133 stands for fluid variables such as velocity , temperature , etc ..    the equation governing @xmath134 is obtained from ( 39 ) by separating it into mean and fluctuating parts .",

    "the relative variance stays within sound realm , and approaches unity with increase in turbulence in the temperature and with zeldovich number .",
    "this is a sign of stochastic signals characteristic of on - off type .",
    "statistical description of stochastic phenomena where relative variance far exceeds unity is pathological .",
    "it is for this reason that a formalism using the averaged arrhenius law fails in describing turbulent combustion .",
    "however , as asserted in the preceding section , such formalism using the bimodal law as the averaged reaction rate deserves reconsideration . for this purpose",
