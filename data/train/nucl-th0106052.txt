    "in the quark model , the baryon - baryon interactions for the complete octet baryons ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) are treated entirely equivalently with the well - known nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath8 ) interaction .",
    "once the quark - model hamiltonian is assumed in the framework of the resonating - group method ( rgm ) , the explicit evaluation of the spin - flavor factors leads to the stringent flavor dependence appearing in various interaction pieces .",
    "we can thus minimize the ambiguity of the model parameters by utilizing the rich knowledge of the @xmath8 interaction .    in this study we first upgrade our previous model @xcite for the @xmath8 and hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath9 ) interactions by incorporating more complete effective meson - exchange potentials ( emep ) such as the vector mesons and some extra interaction pieces .",
    "this model is named fss2 @xcite after the pioneering model fss . fixing the model parameters in the strangeness @xmath10 and @xmath11 sectors ,",
    "we proceed to explore the @xmath2 interactions in @xmath3 and @xmath4 sectors .",
    "these include the @xmath12 and @xmath13 interactions , which have recently been attracting much interest in the rapidly developing fields of hypernuclear physics and strangeness nuclear matter .",
    "in the next section , we recapitulate the formulation of the @xmath14-@xmath14 lippmann - schwinger rgm @xcite . in sec.iii , we summarize the essential features of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 interactions , in order to furnish the basic components to understand the phase - shift behavior of the @xmath2 interactions in a unified way .",
    "the model predictions of the @xmath2 interactions in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 sectors are given in sec.iv , with respect to the @xmath5-wave phase shifts and the total cross sections .",
    "the final section is devoted to a summary .",
    "the quark - model hamiltonian @xmath15 consists of the phenomenological confinement potential @xmath16 , the colored version of the full fermi - breit ( fb ) interaction @xmath17 with explicit quark - mass dependence , and the emep @xmath18 generated from the scalar ( @xmath19=s ) , pseudoscalar ( ps ) and vector ( v ) meson exchange potentials acting between quarks : @xmath20 it is important to include the momentum - dependent bryan - scott term @xcite in the s- and v - meson contributions , in order to remedy the shortcoming of our previous model fss , namely the single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "potential in nuclear matter is too attractive in the high - momentum region @xmath21 .",
    "another important feature of the present model is the introduction of vector mesons for improving the fit to the @xmath8 phase - shift parameters . since the dominant effect of the @xmath22-meson repulsion and the @xmath23 components of @xmath24 , @xmath22 and @xmath25 mesons are already accounted for by the fb interaction , only the quadratic @xmath23 component of the octet mesons",
    "is expected to play an important role in partially canceling the strong one - pion tensor force .",
    "further details of the model fss2 are given in @xcite .",
    "the model parameters are fixed to reproduce the most recent results of the phase shift analysis sp99",
    "@xcite for the @xmath26 scattering with partial waves @xmath27 and incident energies @xmath28 , under the constraint of the deuteron binding energy and the @xmath29 @xmath8 scattering length , as well as the low - energy @xmath9 total cross section data . owing to the introduction of the vector mesons ,",
    "the model fss2 in the @xmath8 sector has attained an accuracy almost comparable to that of one - boson exchange potential ( obep ) models . for example , the @xmath30 values defined by @xmath31 for the @xmath27 phase - shift parameters in the energy range @xmath32 - 300 mev are @xmath33 = @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 for fss2 , obep , paris and bonn , respectively .",
    "the existing data for the @xmath9 scattering are well reproduced and the essential feature of the @xmath38-@xmath39 coupling is almost unchanged from our previous models .",
    "the two - baryon systems composed of the complete baryon octet are classified as @xmath40 where @xmath41 stands for the spin value @xmath5 and the flavor @xmath42 representation label @xmath43 .",
    "if the space - spin states are classified by the flavor exchange symmetry @xmath44 , the correspondence between the @xmath42 basis and the isospin basis becomes very transparent , as in table [ table1 ] .",
    "this correspondence is essential in the following discussion .",
    "the key point is that the quark - model hamiltonian is approximately @xmath42 scalar .",
    "if we ignore the emep terms @xmath45 , this is fairly apparent since the flavor dependence appears only through the moderate mass difference of the up - down and strange quarks . in the fb interaction @xmath17",
    ", this is a direct consequence of the fact that the gluons do not have the flavor degree of freedom . in the emep terms ,",
    "the @xmath42 scalar property of the interaction is not apparent since the mesons have the flavor degree of freedom .",
    "nevertheless , one can easily show that the interaction hamiltonian is actually @xmath42 scalar if the masses of the octet mesons are all equal within each of the s , ps and v mesons .",
    "a nice feature of the quark model is that the approximate @xmath42-scalar property of the total hamiltonian is automatically incorporated in the model . on the other hand , in the obep a similar situation",
    "is only realized by assuming the @xmath42 relations for the many baryon - meson coupling constants .",
    "if the hamiltonian is exactly @xmath42 scalar , the @xmath42 states with a common @xmath43 in table [ table1 ] should have the same baryon - baryon interaction .",
    "for example , the same ( 22 ) symmetry appears in several @xmath29 states ; i.e. , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath29 phase shifts of these channels have very similar behavior , as is shown in fig.[fig1 ] . in reality",
    ", the @xmath42 symmetry is broken , but in a very specific way .",
    "the mechanism of the flavor symmetry breaking ( fsb ) depends on the details of the model . in the present framework ,",
    "the following three factors cause fsb :    1 .   the strange to up - down quark mass ratio @xmath51 in the kinetic - energy term and @xmath17 .",
    "the singlet - octet meson mixing in @xmath45 .",
    "3 .   the meson and baryon mass splitting in @xmath45 and the kinetic - energy term , and the resultant difference of the threshold energies .",
    "the approximate @xmath42-scalar property of the hamiltonian implies that accurate knowledge of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 interactions is crucial to understand the @xmath0-@xmath0 interactions in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 sectors .",
    "the following four points concerning the qualitative behavior of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 interactions are essential .",
    "@xcite first , in the @xmath8 system the @xmath29 state with isospin @xmath54 consists of the pure ( 22 ) state , and the phase shift shows a clear resonance behavior reaching more than @xmath55 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) . on the other hand , the @xmath56 state with @xmath54",
    "is composed of the pure ( 03 ) state , and the deuteron is bound in this channel owing to the strong one - pion tensor force .",
    "if we switch off this strong tensor force , the @xmath57 phase shift rises to @xmath58 at most , indicating that the central attraction of the ( 03 ) state is not as strong as that of the ( 22 ) state ( see crosses in fig.[fig2 ] ) . detailed analysis of the @xmath9 interaction has clarified that the @xmath59 state for the @xmath29 state and the ( 30 ) state for the @xmath56 state are both strongly repulsive , reflecting that the most compact @xmath60 configuration is completely pauli forbidden for the @xmath59 state and almost forbidden for the ( 30 ) state .",
    "@xcite the repulsive behavior of the @xmath47 @xmath56 state with the pure ( 30 ) symmetry should be observed as a strong isospin dependence of the @xmath61 s.p . potential . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental evidence of the repulsion is not clear for the @xmath62 @xmath29 state , which contains 90 % @xmath59 component .",
    "this is because the observables are usually composed of the contributions both from the @xmath29 and @xmath56 states , and the @xmath56 state in this channel involves a rather cumbersome @xmath38-@xmath62 channel coupling .",
    "nevertheless , the repulsive character of the @xmath59 state is not inconsistent with the present experimental evidence , in the sense that fss and fss2 reproduce the available low - energy cross section data of the @xmath63 and @xmath64 scatterings quite well .",
    "the strength of this repulsion depends on the detailed framework of the quark model . in the obep approach ,",
    "even the qualitative features of these interactions are sometimes not reproduced .",
    "for example , in the @xmath47 @xmath56 state almost all the nijmegen soft - core models @xcite predict a broad resonance around the intermediate energy region of @xmath65 mev , although the low - energy behavior of the phase shifts are surely repulsive .    the following two additional features of the present model",
    "should be kept in mind during the discussion of the @xmath2 interactions in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 sectors .",
    "first , the flavor - singlet ( 00 ) state which appears in the @xmath66 sector for the first time is usually attractive in the quark model , owing to the @xmath67-type color - magnetic interaction involved in @xmath17 . whether the @xmath15-dibaryon state with the pure ( 00 ) is bound or not depends on how much the strangeness - exchange emep contribution cancels the strong channel coupling effect from the fb interaction @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite next , the @xmath68 configuration which appears in the @xmath69 sector partially appears in the @xmath56 state in @xmath70 in the pure @xmath42 form .",
    "the fss2 prediction for the phase shift of this interaction , depicted in fig.[fig2 ] , implies that this interaction is very weak , since the phase - shift rise is only @xmath71 .",
    "nevertheless , the phase shift behavior of the @xmath56 states for the @xmath38 and @xmath62 channels in the @xmath69 sector is very different @xcite .",
    "this is apparently due to the strong effect of the one - pion tensor force , which is present in the @xmath39 channel , while absent in the @xmath38 channel .",
    "we can therefore conclude that a further important factor besides the fsb is the specific effect of the goldstone - boson pions , which is very much channel dependent . as a consequence of the @xmath42 relations ,",
    "the role of the pion is generally reduced if the strangeness involved in the system increases .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows a `` reflection '' symmetry with respect to the interchange between @xmath10 and @xmath73 sectors , and also between @xmath69 and @xmath74 sectors . just like the particle - hole symmetry in the nuclear shell model ,",
    "the @xmath42 state on one side is obtained from the @xmath43 state on the other side by simply interchanging the @xmath75 and @xmath76 . since the ( 22 )",
    "( and also @xmath59 ) symmetry in the @xmath29 state returns to itself , the @xmath8 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 interactions with @xmath77 being replaced by @xmath7 should be very similar to the original ones .",
    "on the other hand , in the @xmath56 state the ( 03 ) symmetry changes into the ( 30 ) symmetry and the attractive interaction turns to the repulsive one .",
    "for example , @xmath78 interaction with the pure ( 30 ) symmetry is repulsive .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows that the @xmath79 total cross sections are about 1/4 @xmath80 1/5 of the @xmath8 cross sections .",
    "this result is different from the very large prediction of the nijmegen soft - core potentials in @xcite , which have strong attractions in all the ( 22 ) channels except for the @xmath8 and @xmath81 ones . among the strangeness @xmath0-@xmath0 channels having the @xmath29 ( 22 ) configuration",
    ", the most attractive @xmath56 state is expected for the @xmath49 interaction .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows that this interaction has a very interesting feature : the two @xmath42 symmetries ( 22 ) and ( 03 ) in the @xmath8 interaction appear in a common isospin state @xmath82 .",
    "unlike the ( 03 ) state in @xmath8 , the ( 03 ) state in @xmath49 is only moderately attractive , since the @xmath83 system does not allow the strong one - pion exchange in the exchange feynman diagram . even in the direct feynman diagram ,",
    "the inclusion of the strangeness reduces the one - pion exchange effect drastically through the @xmath42 relations .",
    "the @xmath84 interaction thus gives the largest total cross sections in the strangeness sector , together with the @xmath85 interaction , as seen in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the magnitudes of these total cross sections , however , are at most comparable with the @xmath86 total cross sections .",
    "the @xmath87-@xmath88 coupled - channel problem , on the other hand , is less interesting , since the one - pion tensor force in the @xmath89 state becomes less effective due to the strong repulsion of the ( 30 ) component .",
    "this is in contrast with the strong @xmath38-@xmath62 channel coupling , which leads to the well - known cusp structure in the @xmath38 total cross sections .",
    "the baryon - baryon interactions in the @xmath66 sector constitute the most difficult case to analyze , involving three different types of two - baryon configurations : @xmath12-@xmath13-@xmath90 for @xmath91 and @xmath13-@xmath92-@xmath90 for @xmath54 . in this case",
    ", the isospin dependence of the interaction is very important , just as in the @xmath93 interactions with @xmath94 and 3/2 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the @xmath29 phase - shift behavior of the full @xmath12-@xmath13-@xmath90 coupled - channel system with @xmath91 , in which the @xmath15-dibaryon bound state might exist . in the previous model fss",
    "the @xmath12 phase shift rises to @xmath95 @xcite , while in the present fss2 it rises only to @xmath96 at most .",
    "the situation is the same as in the @xmath70 phase shift .",
    "it rises only to @xmath97 in fss2 .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows that the largest contribution of the ( 00 ) component is realized not in the @xmath12 channel , but in the @xmath70 channel .",
    "this implies that the attractive effect of the ( 00 ) configuration is smaller in fss2 than in fss . since fss",
    "does not have the @xmath15-dibaryon bound state @xcite , fss2 does not have it either . as to the @xmath12 interaction , it has been claimed that a phase - shift rise on the order of @xmath95 is at least necessary to explain the known three events of the double @xmath98-hypernuclei .",
    "however , the recently discovered the `` demachi - yanagi event '' @xcite for @xmath99 and the `` nagara event '' @xcite for @xmath100 indicate that the @xmath12 interaction is less attractive .",
    "a rough estimate of @xmath101 for @xmath100 in terms of the @xmath102-matrix calculation using fss2 is about 1 mev , which is consistent with this experimental observation .    in the isospin @xmath54 channel ,",
    "the lowest incident baryon channel in the @xmath66 sector is the @xmath13 channel .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows the phase - shift behavior of the @xmath29 and @xmath56 states , calculated for the full coupled - channel system @xmath13-@xmath92-@xmath90 with @xmath54 . in the @xmath103 single - channel calculation ,",
    "both of these phase shifts show monotonic repulsive behavior , originating from the main contributions of the @xmath59 and ( 30 ) components , respectively .",
    "@xcite in the full coupled - channel calculation , however , the channel coupling effect between @xmath103 and @xmath92 channels is enhanced by the cooperative role of the fb contribution @xmath17 and emep contribution @xmath18 in the strangeness exchange process . as a result",
    ", the @xmath103 phase shifts show very prominent cusp structure at the @xmath92 threshold , as seen in fig.[fig5 ] . below the @xmath92 threshold ,",
    "the phase - shift values are almost zero .",
    "subsequently , the @xmath104 ( and @xmath105 ) total cross sections with the pure @xmath54 component are predicted to be very small below the @xmath92 threshold around @xmath106 .",
    "this behavior of the @xmath107 total cross sections , illustrated in fig.[fig6](b ) , is essentially the same as the nijmegen result in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath108 total cross sections , shown in fig.[fig6](a ) , exhibit a typical channel - coupling behavior similar to that of the @xmath64 total cross sections .",
    "these features demonstrate that the @xmath92 channel - coupling effect is very important for the correct description of scattering observables , resulting in the strong isospin dependence of the @xmath13 interaction .",
    "the conversion processes among octet baryons @xmath0 are most straightforwardly incorporated in the coupled - channel formalism . since",
    "our quark model hamiltonian is approximately @xmath42 scalar , it is crucial to clarify the characteristics of the @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction for each of the @xmath42 states , rather than for each of the two - baryon systems .",
    "an inter - baryon potential in a single baryon channel is sometimes used for the study of hypernuclei and strangeness nuclear matter . however , such effective interactions are very much model dependent and linkage to the bare interactions like the ones discussed here is sometimes obscured by inherent ambiguities originating from the many - body calculations . the widespread argument that the hypernuclear structure reflects the hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath9 ) interaction rather faithfully since the @xmath9 interaction is weak should not be overemphasized .    in this study",
    "we have upgraded our previous quark model @xcite for the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 interactions by incorporating more complete effective meson - exchange potentials such as the vector mesons and some extra interaction pieces .",
    "this model fss2 @xcite reproduces the existing data of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 interactions quite well .",
    "we have then proceeded to predict all the @xmath2 interactions in the strangeness @xmath3 and @xmath4 sectors , without adding any extra parameters .",
    "we have discussed some characteristic features of the @xmath2 interactions , focusing on the qualitative aspect . among these features",
    "are the following : 1 ) there is no bound state in the @xmath2 systems , except for the deuteron ; 2 ) the @xmath79 total cross sections are far smaller than the @xmath8 cross sections ; 3 ) the @xmath13 interaction has a strong isospin dependence similar to the @xmath39 system ; 4 ) the @xmath84 ( @xmath49 ) interaction is moderately attractive .",
    "the @xmath5-wave phase - shift behavior yielding these qualitative features of the @xmath2 interactions is systematically understood by 1 ) the spin - flavor @xmath1 symmetry , 2 ) the special role of the pion exchange and 3 ) the flavor symmetry breaking . more detailed analysis of the @xmath2 interactions predicted by the model fss2 and consistency with the available experimental data will be published in a forthcoming paper .",
