    "the study of the maxima of gaussian fields has a rich history , which we will not attempt to survey here .",
    "the general theory was developed in the 70s and 80s , and an excellent account can be found in @xcite .",
    "however , general results concerning the order of fluctuations of the maximum are lacking .    in recent years",
    ", a special effort has been directed toward the study of the so called gaussian free field ( gff ) on various graphs .",
    "while we postpone the general definition to the next section , we discuss in this introduction the special case of the gff on subsets @xmath2\\cap \\mathbb{z})^d$ ] , with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "these are random fields @xmath3 indexed by points in @xmath4 , with joint density ( with respect to lebesgue measure ) proportional to @xmath5 with the sum over neighbors in @xmath4 , and @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "( an alternative description involving the green function of random walk on @xmath4 is given below in section [ sect2 ] ; see also @xcite for a very readable introduction to gffs in a continuous setting . ) with @xmath8 denoting the maximum of the gff on @xmath4 in dimension @xmath9 , it is not hard to see that @xmath8 is of order @xmath10 for @xmath11 , order @xmath12 for @xmath13 , and order @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , a consequence of the borell - tsirelson inequality ( see @xcite ) is that for @xmath15 , since simple random walk is transient on @xmath16 , the fluctuations of @xmath8 are at most of order @xmath17 , while for @xmath11 the fluctuations of @xmath18 are of the same order as @xmath18 , i.e. of order @xmath10 .",
    "the critical case @xmath13 was settled only recently @xcite , where it was shown that the fluctuations of @xmath19 are also of order @xmath17 .",
    "this raises naturally the question of determining for which sequences of graphs is the sequence of recentered maxima of the gff tight .",
    "our goal in this paper is to exhibit a class of sequences of graphs , which are fractal - like and for which the maximum of the gff fluctuates at the same order as the maximum itself , and both are of the order of the maximal standard deviation of the gff in the graph . in that respect ,",
    "the behavior of the maximum is similar to that of @xmath18 . for this class of graphs ,",
    "we also show that the _ cover time _ of the graph , measured in terms of the ( square root of the ) local time at a fixed vertex , also does not concentrate .",
    "( we note in passing that for the cover time of @xmath4 in two dimensions , it is , to the best of our knowledge , an open problem to decide whether this quantity concentrates or not . )",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the gff on general graphs and state assumption [ thm : assump1 ] that characterizes the graphs which we investigate ; the main feature is a relation between the graph distance and the resistance , and control of the covering number of the graph in terms of resistance distance .",
    "we then state our main result , theorem [ thm : main thm ] , concerning fluctuations of the maximum of the gff .",
    "we also state proposition [ thm : main prop ] concerning the cover time of the graphs .",
    "proofs of the theorem and proposition are given in section [ sect : proofs ] .",
    "the heart of the paper is then section [ sect : examples ] , where we show that certain naturally constructed fractal - like graphs satisfy our assumptions . in particular , this is the case for the standard sierpinski carpets in two dimensions and gaskets in all dimensions .    *",
