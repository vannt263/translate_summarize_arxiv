    "since its discovery in 1988 by haldane  @xcite and shastry  @xcite , the haldane  shastry model ( hsm ) has amply contributed to our understanding of fractional quantization in one - dimensional spin chains .",
    "the model provides a framework to formulate and analyze spinons , the elementary excitations of one - dimensional spin chains , at the level of explicit wave functions  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was realized through this model that spinons in su(2 ) spin chains obey half - fermi statistics  @xcite .",

    "the hsm was also generalized by kuramoto and yokoyama  @xcite to allow for mobile holes .",

    "while explicit wave functions for one - holon states in the su(2 ) kym were known for many years  @xcite , the construction of the exact two - holon states was achieved only recently  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the single - holon momenta in these states were found to be shifted by a fraction of the units @xmath5 appropriate for a chain with @xmath6 sites , periodic boundary conditions ( pbcs ) , and a lattice constant set to unity .",
    "this result was interpreted as a manifestation of half - fermi and hence fractional statistics among the holon excitations  @xcite , thus confirming a conclusion reached by ha and haldane  @xcite using the asymptotic bethe ansatz , by kuramoto and kato  @xcite from thermodynamics , and by arikawa , yamamoto , saiga , and kuramoto  @xcite from the electron addition spectral function of the model . like the hsm",

    ", we investigate the case of su(3 ) .",
    "we first present the basic properties of the model including the ground state and the coloron excitations in the absence of holes , where the su(3 ) kym reduces to the su(3 ) hsm studied previously in a similar framework  @xcite .",
    "we then construct the explicit one - holon and two - holon wave functions and derive the exact energies and single - holon momenta . in section  [ secsun ] , we generalize the results to su(@xmath0 ) .",

    "for all practical purposes , it is convenient to express the su(3 ) spin operators in terms of colorflip operators @xmath24 .",

    "the traceless parts of the operators @xmath30 generate the lie superalgebra su(1@xmath313 ) , which includes in particular the total spin operators @xmath32 .",
