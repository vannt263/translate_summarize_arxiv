    "in the mssm ( `` minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model '' ) gauge couplings unify at an energy scale of about @xmath1 gev . adding particles arbitrarily to",
    "the mssm easily destroys this attractive feature .",
    "thus , relatively few susy models have been discussed in the literature which have a larger than mssm particle content at experimentally accessible energies .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite , however , have shown that at least one neutrino must have a mass @xmath2 ev .",
    "a ( majorana ) neutrino mass of this order indicates the existence of a new energy scale below @xmath3 . for models with renormalizable interactions and perturbative couplings , as for example in the classical seesaw models",
    "@xcite , this new scale should lie below approximately @xmath4 gev .",
    "from the theoretical point of view gut models based on the group @xmath5 @xcite offer a number of advantages compared to the simpler models based on @xmath6 .",
    "for example , several of the chains through which @xmath5 can be broken to the sm gauge group contain the left - right symmetric group @xmath7 as an intermediate step @xcite , thus potentially explaining the observed left - handedness of the weak interactions .",
    "however , probably the most interesting aspect of @xmath5 is that it automatically contains the necessary ingredients to generate a seesaw mechanism @xcite : ( i ) the right - handed neutrino is included in the @xmath8 which forms a fermion family ; and ( ii ) @xmath9 is one of the generators of @xmath5 .",
    "left - right ( lr ) symmetric models usually break the lr symmetry at a rather large energy scale , @xmath10 .",
    "for example , if lr is broken in the susy lr model by the vev of @xmath11 triplets @xcite or by a combination of @xmath11 and @xmath12 triplets @xcite , @xmath13 gev is the typical scale consistent with gauge coupling unification ( gcu ) .",
    "the authors of @xcite find a lower limit of @xmath14 gev from gcu for models where the lr symmetry is broken by triplets , even if one allows additional non - renormalizable operators or sizeable gut - scale thresholds to be present . on the other hand , in models with an extended gauge group it is possible to formulate sets of conditions on the @xmath15-coefficients for the gauge couplings , which allow to enforce gcu independent of the energy scale at which the extended gauge group is broken .",
    "this was called the `` sliding mechanism '' in @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite was not the first to present examples of `` sliding scale '' models in the literature .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that , if the left - right group is broken to @xmath16 by the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field @xmath17 then the resulting @xmath18 can be broken to @xmath19 of the sm in agreement with experimental data at any energy scale . in @xcite",
    "the authors demonstrated that in fact a complete lr group can be lowered to the tev - scale , if certain carefully chosen fields are added and the lr - symmetry is broken by right doublets .",
    "a particularly simple model of this kind was discussed in @xcite .",
    "finally , the authors of @xcite discussed also an alternative way of constructing a sliding lr scale by relating it to an intermediate pati - salam stage .",
    "we note in passing that these papers are not in contradiction with the earlier work @xcite , which all have to have large @xmath10 .",
    "as discussed briefly in the next section it is not possible to construct a sliding scale variant for an lr model including pairs of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "three different constructions , based on different @xmath5 breaking chains , were considered in @xcite . in chain - i",
    "so(10 ) is broken in exactly one intermediate ( lr symmetric ) step to the standard model group : @xmath22 in chain - ii so(10 ) is broken first to the pati - salam group : @xcite @xmath23 and finally , in chain - iii : @xmath24 in all cases the last symmetry breaking scale before reaching the sm group can be as low as @xmath25 tev maintaining nevertheless gcu .",
    "the papers discussed above @xcite give at most one or two example models for each chain , i.e. they present a `` proof of principle '' that models with the stipulated conditions indeed can be constructed in agreement with experimental constraints .",
    "it is then perhaps natural to ask : how unique are the models discussed in these papers ?",
    "the answer we find for this question is , perhaps unsurprisingly , that a huge number of variants exist in each class . even in the simplest class ( chain - i ) we have found a total of 53 variants ( up to 5324 `` configurations '' , see next section ) which can have perturbative gcu and a lr scale below 10 tev , consistent with experimental data .",
    "for the two other classes , chain - ii and chain - iii , we have found literally thousands of variants .",
    "with such a huge number of variants of essentially `` equivalent '' constructions one immediate concern is , whether there is any way of distinguishing among all of these constructions experimentally .",
    "tests could be either direct or indirect .",
    "direct tests are possible , because of the sliding scale feature of the classes of models we discuss , see section [ sec : models ] .",
    "different variants predict different additional ( s)particles , some of which ( being colored ) could give rise to spectacular resonances at the lhc .",
    "however , even if the new gauge symmetry and all additional fields are outside the reach of the lhc , all variants have different @xmath15 coefficients and thus different running of mssm parameters , both gauge couplings and susy soft masses .",
    "thus , if one assumes the validity of a certain susy breaking scheme , such as for example msugra , indirect traces of the different variants remain in the susy spectrum , potentially measurable at the lhc and a future ilc / clic .",
    "this was discussed earlier in the context of indirect tests for the susy seesaw mechanism in @xcite and for extended gauge models in @xcite .",
    "we generalize the discussion of @xcite and show how the `` invariants '' , i.e. certain combinations of susy soft breaking parameters , can themselves be organized into a few classes , which in principle allow to distinguish class - ii models from class - i or class - iii and , if sufficient precision could be reached experimentally , even select specific variants within a class and give indirect information about the new energy scale(s ) .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in the next section we first lay out the general conditions for the construction of the models we are interested in , before discussing variants and example configurations for all of the three classes we consider .",
    "section [ sect : invariants ] then discusses `` invariants '' , i.e. susy soft parameters in the different model classes .",
    "we then close with a short summary and discussion .",
    "several technical aspects of our work are presented in the appendix .",
    "before entering into the details of the different model classes , we will first list some general requirements which we use in all constructions . these requirements are the basic conditions any model has to fulfill to guarantee at least in principle that a phenomenologically realistic model will result .",
    "we use the following conditions :    * perturbative so(10 ) unification .",
    "that is , gauge couplings unify ( at least ) as well as in the mssm and the value of @xmath26 is in the perturbative regime . *",
    "the gut scale should lie above ( roughly ) @xmath27 gev .",
    "this bound is motivated by the limit on the proton decay half - live . *",
    "sliding mechanism .",
    "this requirement is a set of conditions ( different conditions for different classes of models ) on the allowed @xmath15 coefficients of the gauge couplings , which ensure the additional gauge group structure can be broken at any energy scale consistent with gcu . * renormalizable symmetry breaking .",
    "this implies that at each intermediate step we assume there are ( at least ) the minimal number of higgs fields , which the corresponding symmetry breaking scheme requires .",
    "* fermion masses and in particular neutrino masses .",
    "this condition implies that the field content of the extended gauge groups is rich enough to fit experimental data , although we will not attempt detailed fits of all data .",
    "in particular , we require the fields to generate majorana neutrino masses through seesaw , either ordinary seesaw or inverse / linear seesaw , to be present .",
    "* anomaly cancellation .",
    "we accept as valid `` models '' only field configurations which are anomaly free .",
    "* @xmath5 completable .",
    "all fields used in a lower energy stage must be parts of a multiplet present at the next higher symmetry stage .",
    "in particular , all fields should come from the decomposition of one of the @xmath5 multiplets we consider ( multiplets up to @xmath28 ) . *",
    "correct mssm limit .",
    "all models must be rich enough in particle content that at low energies the mssm can emerge .",
    "a few more words on our naming convention and notations might be necessary .",
    "we consider the three different @xmath5 breaking chains , eq .",
    "( [ eq : chaini])-([eq : chainiii ] ) , and will call these model `` classes '' . in each class",
    "there are fixed sets of @xmath15-coefficients , which all lead to gcu but with different values of @xmath26 and different values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 at low energies .",
    "these different sets are called `` variants '' in the following . and finally , ( nearly )",
    "all of the variants can be created by more than one possible set of superfields .",
    "we will call such a set of superfields a `` configuration '' .",
    "configurations are what usually is called `` model '' by model builders , although we prefer to think of these as `` proto - models '' , i.e. constructions fulfilling all our basic requirements .",
    "these are only proto - models ( and not full - fledged models ) , since we do not check for each configuration in a detailed calculation that all the fields required in that configuration can remain light .",
    "we believe that for many , but probably not all , of the configurations one can find conditions for the required field combinations being `` light '' , following similar conditions as discussed in the prototype class - i model of @xcite .",
    "all superfields are named as @xmath31 ( in the left - right symmetric stage ) , @xmath32 ( in the pati - salam regime ) and @xmath33 ( in the @xmath18 regime ) , with the indices giving the transformation properties under the group .",
    "a conjugate of a field is denoted by , for example , @xmath34 , however , without putting a corresponding `` bar '' ( or minus sign ) in the index .",
    "we list all fields we use , together with their transformation properties and their origin from @xmath5 multiplets , complete up to the @xmath28 of @xmath5 in the appendix .",
    "we start our discussion with the simplest class of models with only one new intermediate scale ( lr ) : @xmath35 we do not discuss the first symmetry breaking step in detail , since it is not relevant for the following discussion and only mention that @xmath5 can be broken to the lr group either via the interplay of vevs from a @xmath36 and a @xmath37 , as done for example in @xcite , or via a @xmath36 and a @xmath38 , an approach followed in @xcite .",
    "in the left - right symmetric stage we consider all irreducible representations , which can be constructed from @xmath5 multiplets up to dimension @xmath28 .",
    "this allows for a total of 24 different representations ( plus conjugates ) , their transformation properties under the lr group and their @xmath5 origin are summarized in table  [ tab : list_of_lr_fields ] ( and table  [ tab : list_of_patisalam_fields ] ) of the appendix .",
    "consider gauge coupling unification first .",
    "if we take the mssm particle content as a starting point , the @xmath15-coefficients in the different regimes are given as : and @xmath39 we use the sm particle content plus one additional higgs doublet . ]",
    "@xmath40 where we have used the canonical normalization for @xmath9 related to the physical one by @xmath41 . here",
    ", @xmath42 stands for the contributions from additional superfields , not accounted for in the mssm .    as is well known , while the mssm unifies , putting an additional lr scale below the gut scale with @xmath43 destroys unification",
    ". nevertheless gcu can be maintained , if some simple conditions on the @xmath42 are fulfilled .",
    "first , since in the mssm @xmath44 at roughly @xmath45 gev one has that @xmath46 in order to preserve this situation for an arbitrary lr scale ( sliding condition ) .",
    "next , recall the matching condition @xmath47 which , by substitution of the lr scale by an arbitrary one above @xmath48 , allows us to define an artificial continuation of the hypercharge coupling constant @xmath49 into the lr stage .",
    "the @xmath15-coefficient of this dummy coupling constant for @xmath50 is @xmath51 and it should be compared with @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) ; the difference is @xmath54 and it must be equal to @xmath55 in order for the difference between this @xmath49 coupling and @xmath44 at the gut to be independent of the scale @xmath48 .",
    "these are the two conditions imposed by the sliding requirement of the lr scale on the @xmath15-coefficients [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : variantslr ] ) ] .",
    "note , however , that we did not require ( approximate ) unification of @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 ; it was sufficient to require that @xmath58 . in any case , we can always achieve the desired unification because the splitting between @xmath29 and @xmath30 at the @xmath48 scale is a free parameter , so it can be used to force @xmath59 at the scale where @xmath56 and @xmath57 unify , which leads to an almost perfect unification of the four couplings .",
    "also , we require that unification is perturbative , i.e. the value of the common coupling constant at the gut scale is @xmath60 . from the experimental value of @xmath61 @xcite one",
    "can easily calculate the maximal allowed value of @xmath55 as a function of the scale , where the lr group is broken to the sm group .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : maxdb ] for three different values of @xmath62 .",

    "@xmath63 $ ] one obtains max(@xmath64 ) in the range [ @xmath65 , i.e. we will study cases up to a max@xmath66 ( see , however , the discussion below ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     here , the invariants depend on @xmath67 with a milder or stronger dependence , depending on the value of @xmath68 . for almost all the solutions with @xmath69 ,",
    "the values @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 are constants and only in @xmath73 a mild variation with @xmath67 is found .",
    "this fact was already pointed out in @xcite .",
    "however , we have found that class - iii models can be made with @xmath74 and these , in general , lead to invariants which are qualitatively similar to the case of class - i discussed above . in fig .",
    "( [ fig : invbl ] ) we show two examples of invariants for class - iii , one with @xmath69 and one with @xmath75 .",
    "the solutions with @xmath76 fall in two kinds : the minimum value of @xmath48 is very large .",
    "then , the invariants have the same behavior than those in which @xmath69 .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath48 is low .",
    "the invariants are not constants and look similar to the ones in the class - i models .",
    "the generally mild dependence on @xmath67 can be understood , since it enters into the soft masses only through the changes in the abelian gauge couplings .",
    "class - iii models are therefore the hardest to `` test '' using invariants .      the classification of variants that we have discussed in section [ sect : invclasses ] only takes into account what happens when the lowest intermediate scale is very low , @xmath77 .",
    "when one varies continuously the lowest intermediate scale ( @xmath48 in the lr and ps - class models or @xmath67 in the bl - class of models ) , each variant draws a line in the 4-dimensional space @xmath78 .",
    "the dimensionality of such a plot can be lowered if we use the ( approximate ) relations between the invariants shown above , namely @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we can then choose two independent ones , for example @xmath73 and @xmath72 , so that the only non - trivial information between the 4 invariants is encoded in a @xmath81 plot .",
    "in this way , it is possible to simultaneous display the predictions of different variants .",
    "this was done in fig .",
    "( [ fig : leqe_parametric_plot_rgb ] ) , where lr- , ps- and bl - variants are drawn together .",
    "the plot is exhaustive in the sense that it includes all lr - variants , as well as all ps- and bl - variants which can have the highest intermediate scale below @xmath82 gev . in all cases",
    ", we required that @xmath83 at unification is larger than @xmath84 when the lowest intermediate scale is equal to @xmath85 .",
    "parametric @xmath81 plot for the different variants ( see text ) .",
    "the thicker lines labeled with i , ii , iii and iv indicate the result for the four prototype models presented in @xcite . ]",
    "there is a dot in the middle of the figure - the msugra point - which corresponds to the prediction of msugra models , in the approximation used .",
    "it is expected that every model will draw a line with one end close to this point .",
    "this end - point corresponds to the limit where the intermediate scales are close to the gut scale and therefore the running in the lr , ps and bl phases is small so the invariants should be similar to those in msugra models .",
    "so the general picture is that lines tend to start ( when the lowest intermediate scale is of the order of @xmath86 gev ) outside or at the periphery of the plot , away from the msugra point and , as the intermediate scales increase , they converge towards the region of the msugra point , in the middle of the plot . in fact , note that all the blue lines of lr - class models do touch this point , because we can slide the lr scale all the way to @xmath87 .",
    "but in ps- and bl- models there are two intermediate scales and often the lowest one can not be increased all the way up to @xmath87 , either because that would make the highest intermediate scale bigger than @xmath87 or because it would invert the natural ordering of the two intermediate scales .",
    "it is interesting to note that the bl - class with low @xmath48 can produce the same imprint in the sparticle masses as lr - models .",
    "this is to be expected because with @xmath48 close to @xmath67 the running in the u(1)-mixing phase is small , leading to predictions similar to lr - models .",
    "the equivalent limit for ps - class models is reached for very high @xmath88 , close to the gut scale ( see below ) .",
    "on the other hand , from fig .",
    "( [ fig : leqe_parametric_plot_rgb ] ) we can see that a low @xmath88 actually leads to a very different signal on the soft sparticle masses .",
    "for example , a measurement of @xmath89 and @xmath90 , together with compatible values for the other two invariants ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) would immediately exclude _ all classes of models except ps - models _ , and in addition it would strongly suggest low ps and lr scales .    parametric @xmath81 plots for different ps - variants showing the effect of the ps scale . ]    fig .",
    "( [ fig : leqe_parametric_plot_ps_only ] ) illustrates the general behavior of ps - models as we increase the separation between the @xmath93 and @xmath88 scales .",
    "the red region in the @xmath81 plot tends to rotate anti - clockwise until it reaches , for very high @xmath88 , the same region of points which is predicted by lr - models .",
    "curiously , we also see in fig .",
    "( [ fig : leqe_parametric_plot_ps_only ] ) that some of these models actually predict different invariant values from the ones of lr models .",
    "what happens in these cases is that since the ps phase is very short , it is possible to have many active fields in it which decouple at lower energies .",
    "so even though the running is short , the values of the different gauge couplings actually get very large corrections in this regime and these are uncommon in other settings .",
    "for example , it is possible in this special subclass of ps - models for @xmath29 to get bigger than @xmath56/@xmath94 before unifying !",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "( [ fig : leqe_parametric_plot_ps_only ] ) that many , although not all ps - models can lead to large values of @xmath73 .",
    "this can happen for both low and high values of @xmath88 and is a rather particular feature of the class - ii , which can not be found in the other classes .",
    "we have discussed @xmath5 based supersymmetric models with extended gauge group near the electro - weak scale , consistent with gauge coupling unification thanks to a `` sliding scale '' mechanism . we have discussed three different setups , which we call classes of models .",
    "the first and simplest chain we use breaks @xmath5 through a left - right symmetric stage to the sm group , class - ii uses an additional intermediate pati - salam stage , while in class - iii we discuss models which break the lr - symmetric group first into a @xmath18 group before reaching the sm group . we have shown that in each case many different variants and many configurations ( or `` proto - models '' ) for each variant can be constructed .",
    "we have discussed that one can not only construct sliding models in which an inverse or linear seesaw is consistent with gcu , as done in earlier work @xcite , but also all other known types of seesaws can , in principle , be found .",
    "we found example configurations for seesaw type - i , type - ii and type - iii and even inverse type - iii ( for which one example limited to class - ii was previously discussed in @xcite ) .    due to the sliding scale property",
    "the different configurations predict potentially rich phenomenology at the lhc , although by the same reasoning the discovery of any of the additional particles the models predict is of course not guaranteed .",
    "however , even if all the new particles - including the gauge bosons of the extended gauge group - lie outside of the reach of the lhc , indirect tests of the models are possible from measurements of susy particle masses .",
    "we have discussed certain combinations of soft parameters , called `` invariants '' , and shown that the invariants themselves can be classified into a few sets .",
    "just determining to which set the experimental data belongs would allow to distinguish , at least in some cases , class - i from class - ii models and also in all but one case our classes of models are different from the ordinary high - scale seesaw ( type - ii and type - iii ) models .",
    "depending on the accuracy with which supersymmetric masses can be measured in the future , the invariants could be used to gain indirect information not only on the class of model and its variant realized in nature , but also give hints on the scale of beyond - mssm physics , i.e. the energy scale at which the extended gauge group is broken .",
    "we add a few words of caution .",
    "first of all , our analysis is done completely at the 1-loop level .",
    "it is known from numerical calculations for seesaw type - ii @xcite and seesaw type - iii @xcite that the invariants receive numerically important shifts at 2-loop level .",
    "in addition , there are also uncertainties in the calculation from gut - scale thresholds and from uncertainties in the input parameters . for the latter",
    "the most important is most likely the error on @xmath95 @xcite . with the huge number of models we have considered , taking into account all of these effects",
    "is impractical and , thus , our numerical results should be taken as approximate .",
    "however , should any signs of supersymmetry be found in the future , improvements in the calculations along these lines could be easily made , should it become necessary .",
    "more important for the calculation of the invariants is , of course , the assumption that susy breaking indeed is msugra - like . tests of the validity of this assumption can be made also only indirectly .",
    "many of the spectra we find , especially in the class - ii models , are actually quite different from standard msugra expectations and thus a pure mssm - msugra would give a bad fit to experimental data , if one of these models is realized in nature .",
    "however , all of our variants still fulfill ( by construction ) a certain sum rule , see the discussion in section [ sect : invclasses ] .    of course",
    ", so far no signs of supersymmetry have been seen at the lhc , but with the planned increase of @xmath96 for the next run of the accelerator there is still quite a lot of parameter space to be explored .",
    "we note in this respect that we are not overly concerned about the higgs mass , @xmath97 gev , if the new resonance found by the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations turns out to be indeed the lightest higgs boson . while for a pure mssm with msugra boundary conditions it is well - known @xcite that such a hefty higgs requires multi - tev scalars , all our models have an extended gauge symmetry .",
    "thus , there are new d - terms contributing to the higgs mass @xcite , alleviating the need for large soft susy breaking terms , as has been explicitly shown in @xcite for one particular realization of a class - iii model @xcite .",
    "finally , many of the configuration ( or proto - models ) which we have discussed contain exotic superfields , which might show up in the lhc .",
    "it might therefore be interesting to do a more detailed study of the phenomenology of at least some particular of the models we have constructed .",

    "<S> we construct lists of supersymmetric models with extended gauge groups at intermediate steps , all of which are based on so(10 ) unification . </S>",
    "<S> we consider three different kinds of setups : ( i ) the model has exactly one additional intermediate scale with a left - right ( lr ) symmetric group ; ( ii ) so(10 ) is broken to the lr group via an intermediate pati - salam ( ps ) scale ; and ( iii ) the lr group is broken into @xmath0 , before breaking to the sm group . </S>",
    "<S> we use sets of conditions , which we call the `` sliding mechanism '' , which yield unification with the extended gauge group(s ) allowed at arbitrary intermediate energy scales . </S>",
    "<S> all models thus can have new gauge bosons within the reach of the lhc , in principle . </S>",
    "<S> we apply additional conditions , such as perturbative unification , renormalizability and anomaly cancellation and find that , despite these requirements , for the ansatz ( i ) with only one additional scale still around 50 different variants exist that can have an lr symmetry below 10 tev . for the more complicated schemes ( ii ) and ( iii ) literally thousands of possible variants exist , and for scheme ( ii ) we have also found variants with very low ps scales . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss possible experimental tests of the models from measurements of susy masses . </S>",
    "<S> assuming msugra boundary conditions we calculate certain combinations of soft terms , called `` invariants '' , for the different classes of models . </S>",
    "<S> values for all the invariants can be classified into a small number of sets , which contain information about the class of models and , in principle , the scale of beyond - mssm physics , even in case the extended gauge group is broken at an energy beyond the reach of the lhc . </S>"
