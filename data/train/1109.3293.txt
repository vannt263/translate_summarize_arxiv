    "colloidal platelets are abundant in nature ( _ e.g. _ , as clay minerals or red blood cells ) and can be readily synthesized in the laboratory in form of mixed metal hydroxides , gibbsite , gold platelets , et cetera .",
    "the most prominent examples of colloidal platelets are various types of natural clays @xcite , which figure in sediment transport in rivers , and in the oceans and lakes , and which are responsible for dangerous landslides @xcite .",
    "clays are widely used as rheological modifiers for surface coatings , paints , and drilling fluids @xcite .",
    "the rheological applications of clays are based on their microstructural properties , originating from a highly anisotropic shape and a correspondingly anisotropic particle interactions . as a necessary step towards understanding the more complex behavior of concentrated clay platelet suspensions regarding rheology , sedimentation , and sediment transport , the fundamental dynamic properties in dilute isotropic solutions",
    "must be addressed .",
    "so far , most studies on the dynamics of clay and colloidal platelet suspensions have been focused on the non - equilibrium ergodic to non - ergodic transition in dense systems @xcite , and on the properties of the non - ergodic state @xcite .",
    "only few theoretical and experimental investigations have been done so far on less concentrated , fluid - state isotropic suspensions of clays or colloidal platelets .",
    "for instance , both the translational and rotational diffusion coefficients of a single platelet were studied by simulation , and the resulting data for an extended range of aspect ratios were fitted to general polynomial expressions for cylinders by ortega and garca de la torre @xcite .",
    "this study allows to compare the single - platelet diffusion properties of non - interacting platelets with the results of experimental diffusion measurements , but it includes no hint on how diffusion is affected by particle interactions .    the concentration dependence of sedimentation and diffusion coefficients of uncharged , sterically interacting platelets and clays has been explored in @xcite by dynamic light scattering and ultracentrifugation . for platelets , the earlier investigations in @xcite were made in a rather dilute concentration regime where no effect of particle interactions on diffusion was detected .",
    "moreover , explicit theoretical expressions have been derived for the time - dependent intensity autocorrelation function of non - interacting cylindrical particles such as platelets @xcite which , in principle , can be used to determine the single - platelet rotational diffusion coefficient from standard dynamic light scattering or x - ray photon correlation spectroscopy ( xpcs ) measurements in non - interacting particle systems .    for",
    "rather dilute systems of uncharged polymer - grafted clay suspensions @xcite , normalized intensity autocorrelation functions ( iacfs ) have been measured in vertical - vertical ( vv ) and vertical - horizontal ( vh ) scattering geometry @xcite .",
    "a strong slowing of the diffusive modes was found both in vh and in vv geometry . in vv geometry ,",
    "only a single diffusive mode was detected , even though it was argued that a second , cooperative mode should be present due to the osmotic pressure of polymers grafted on the clay particles @xcite .    in the present study , we explore how the dynamics of charged colloidal gibbsite platelets suspended in dmso and present in their isotropic phase , is affected by direct and hydrodynamic particle interactions . using static light scattering ( sls ) and depolarized and non - depolarized dynamic light scattering ( ddls and dls ) , we study the effect of the platelet concentration on the measured translational and rotational self - diffusion coefficients , and on the collective diffusion coefficient .",
    "moreover , the concentration- and shear - rate dependence of the static dispersion viscosity is determined experimentally .",
    "our scattering and rheological experiments cover the full isotropic phase concentration regime up to the i / lc transition .    the theoretical description of the platelet dynamics in non - dilute systems is severely complicated by the anisotropy in the direct @xcite and , to an even larger extent , by the indirect hydrodynamic interactions ( his ) .",
    "no readily applicable theoretical schemes or simulation results are available for our gibbsite system .",
    "therefore , in a first attempt to analyze theoretically the experimental trends in the diffusion data , we use a simplifying model where the direct interactions in a pair of gibbsite platelets are described approximately by the spherically symmetric , repulsive part of the derjaguin - landau - verwey - overbeek ( dlvo ) potential @xcite .",
    "clays , such as laponite , are mixed silica and metal oxides .",
    "this can lead to charges of opposite sign on their faces and edges @xcite .",
    "the present gibbsite platelets consist solely of aluminium hydroxide , so that their faces and rims of gibbsite have surface charges of the same sign @xcite . in our effective sphere model of gibbsite in dmso",
    ", we account for the influence of the his but leave out the effects of interaction polydispersity .",
    "however , the disk - like shape , and the experimentally determined size polydispersity of the gibbsite platelets , are accounted for in the scattering amplitudes .",
    "the simplifying model of cylindrical platelets with spherically symmetric direct and hydrodynamic interactions permits us to take advantage of a wealth of theoretical and computer simulation results on rotational @xcite and translational self - diffusion , and collective diffusion of charged colloidal spheres @xcite .",
    "the model can be expected to apply approximately to semi - dilute suspensions of isotropically dispersed platelets well below the overlap volume fraction . for larger concentrations , it is bound to fail .",

    "a small but finite value of @xmath21 lowers somewhat the values of @xmath22 and @xmath19 , and @xmath20 and @xmath19 become different from each other .",
    "tirado and garca de la torre @xcite provide precise polynomial fits to their simulation data for the diffusion coefficients of cylindrical platelets as a function of @xmath21 .",

    "[ fig : modes_vs_phi ] that the strong decline of the experimental @xmath103 and @xmath219 with increasing @xmath0 , is qualitatively similar to the concentration dependence of the normalized inverse low shear - rate limiting viscosity , @xmath220 . to obtain the low - shear rate viscosity data shown in fig .",

    "our experiments cover the concentration range from very dilute systems up to the i / lc transition .",
    "our usage of dmso as a solvent with a dielectric constant close to that of gibbsite , has enabled us to determine the translational and rotational diffusion properties without the necessity of invoking elaborate x - ray photon correlation spectroscopy measurements .",
    "a fast relaxation mode in the dynamic scattering data has been frequently reported in relation to the liquid - glass transition , the glassy state and also for polymer coated clays @xcite . in the present study , a fast mode has been found also for the isotropic phase , and it has been identified as a collective diffusion mode .    with increasing @xmath0 , the measured collective diffusion coefficient increases up to about twenty times the single - particle ( orientationally averaged ) translational diffusion coefficient .",

    "we have provided arguments , both experimentally and theoretically , that the coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath101 obtained in our scattering modes analysis , should be identified , respectively , with the translational long - time and the mean rotational self - diffusion coefficients of gibbsite platelets .    at low concentrations , @xmath35 is well reproduced in the simplifying translational - rotational decoupling method , where correlations between particle positions , sizes and orientations are neglected , and where the direct platelet interactions are approximated by a spherically symmetric electrosteric repulsion of dlvo type .",
    "the effect of hydrodynamic interactions is accounted for in our effective sphere model .    except for very low concentrations , the accessible @xmath14-range in light scattering experiments is restricted to wavenumbers smaller than the value where the principal structure peak in @xmath35 occurs .",
    "the effective particle charge has therefore been estimated , from the i / lc transition concentration , as @xmath169 , and was kept constant in our model calculations independent of concentration and salinity . for an unambiguous determination of @xmath124 , and to explore its dependence on @xmath0 and @xmath126 , a broader @xmath14-range than accessible in sls is required , which can be studied in future saxs and xpcs measurements . in a more refined theoretical model for @xmath35 , one can account for shape - dependent direct interaction contributions using the prism model @xcite .",
    "however , regarding the dynamic quantities , it will be very difficult to include shape - dependent hydrodynamic interactions , on avoiding numerically expensive multiparticle collision , fluctuating lattice - boltzmann or stokesian dynamics simulations .",
    "we note here that while the simple effective sphere model clearly fails in terms of quantitative predictions , it allows for a correct assessment of qualitative features in the isotropic phase such as the ordering in magnitude of the rotational and translational self - diffusion coefficients , and the approximate plateau region of the collective diffusion coefficient at larger @xmath0 .    upon increasing the concentration ,",
    "peculiar observations have been made in the measured diffusion properties of the gibbsite / dmso system .",
    "similar to suspensions of charge - stabilized colloidal spheres at low ionic strength , @xmath92 grows with increasing concentration . since the value of @xmath92 is basically the same at long and short time scales , and",
    "since the increase in @xmath108 is mainly due to the reducing osmotic compressibility @xmath225 , these basic features of @xmath108 have been reproduced in our effective sphere model , using the calculated @xmath141 as input to the otherwise parameter - free self - part corrected @xmath184-scheme describing the short - time dynamics .",
    "the employed effective sphere model of gibbsite is less accurate regarding the measured long - time dynamic quantities @xmath178 and @xmath101 , which are more sensitive to the anisotropic direct and hydrodynamic interaction parts most influential on shorter length - scales .",
    "the strong decay of both self - diffusion coefficients to less than @xmath194 of their respective infinite dilution values near @xmath114 is not reproducible in an effective sphere model , where @xmath226 even at the largest fluid - state concentration .",
