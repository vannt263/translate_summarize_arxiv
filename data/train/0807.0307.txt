    "quantum crystals like helium and hydrogen are intriguing systems of fundamental physical interest . due to the light mass of their constituents and relatively weak interparticle attraction , quantum solids exhibit large kinetic energy and lindemann s ratio even in the limit of zero temperature ( @xmath5  k ) . in consequence ,",
    "anharmonic effects and atomic quantum exchanges are of importance in this class of crystals . moreover , in the last few years a series of ultra - low temperature experiments performed in solid @xmath2he by different groups has led to a renewed interest on the possibility of superfluidity and/or bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in quantum solids .",
    "@xcite essentially , these experiments analyze the quantum behavior of the helium crystal upon rotation or seek for some thermodynamic and/or structural anomaly signalizing a possible normal - to - superfluid phase transition . despite",
    "that most of the observations fairly agree in locating the onset of superfluidity ( @xmath6  mk ) , there is a large dispersion in the value of the measured superfluid fraction @xmath7 ( @xmath8  % ) . at present , there is lack of conclusive arguments for explaining these discrepancies but it is widely accepted that the purity of the sample and the presence of crystalline defects play on it a relevant role .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , there is overall agreement among microscopic full quantum calculations in practically ruling out superfluidity in the perfect ( free of defects ) bulk configuration .",
    "it is worth noticing that usual techniques devised to study classical crystals ( that is crystals composed of heavier elements and with larger cohesive energies ) , like for instance harmonic based approaches , are not longer suitable for quantum solids and calculations on them are in most cases challenging .",
    "@xcite    in the present work , we present a theoretical study of two - dimensional ( 2d ) molecular para - hydrogen ( p-@xmath0 ) and ortho - deuterium ( o-@xmath1 ) at zero temperature by means of the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method  @xcite and the semi - empirical radial pair interaction due to silvera and goldman .",
    "@xcite hydrogen is a very interesting and challenging system which has been investigated very intensively during the last half century . as a matter of fact",
    ", hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and from a technological point of view it is considered among the most promising green combustibles of the near future . very interestingly , hydrogen has been predicted to exhibit a new state of matter at very high pressures ( @xmath9  gpa ) in which superfluidity and superconductivity might coexist .",
    "@xcite    in this work , we restrict our analysis of molecular hydrogen and deuterium to the low pressure regime ( @xmath10 ) and zero temperature .",
    "contrarily to what occurs in helium , molecular hydrogen freezes at a temperature of 13.96 k in spite of its lighter mass , given that the interactions between particles are more attractive ( the minimum of the interaction between hydrogen molecules amounts to @xmath11  k while in helium is @xmath12  k ) .",
    "one of our motivations for carrying out the present study was to unravel whether liquid p-@xmath0 could be stabilized or not at zero temperature by reducing the dimensionality with respect to the bulk .",
    "this possibility appears to be very appealing since it would provide a chance for superfluidity and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) to be observed in a quantum liquid different from helium .",
    "in fact , p-@xmath0 in one dimension and inside a carbon nanotube has already been studied in the zero - temperature limit and predicted to be liquid at its equilibrium density .",
    "@xcite also , small drops with a number of molecules @xmath13 present superfluid character .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , it has been reported recently an experiment performed on molecular ortho - deuterium pre - plated on krypton at very low temperatures ( @xmath14  k ) in which it is claimed evidence for the existence of a reentrant o-@xmath1 liquid phase .  @xcite as it will be presented in short , our results show that no first order solid - liquid phase transition occurs in two - dimensional @xmath0 at zero temperature .",
    "on account of this result , we straightforwardly reject this possibility also for o-@xmath15 since deuterium molecules are heavier and their intermolecular interactions are considered equal to the h@xmath16-h@xmath16 ones .",
    "consequently , most of the effort done in this work has been devoted to achieve an accurate description of the ground state of two - dimensional solid p-@xmath0 and o-@xmath1  .    in this work ,",
    "we calculate by means of the diffusion monte carlo method ( dmc ) some energetic and structural properties of both hydrogen and deuterium films near equilibrium .",
    "quantities like the kinetic energy per particle and lindemann s ratio have been computed within the pure estimator approach  @xcite in order to remove any possible bias coming out from the trial wave function used for importance sampling . in this way , we quote quantum isotopic effects in hydrogen directly and only within the statistical uncertainty . previous to the dmc results , we present a variational monte carlo ( vmc ) study of the p-@xmath0 crystal in which we have tested the quality of several symmetrized and unsymmetrized trial wave functions . with this analysis",
    ", we determine the effect of symmetrization on the total energy and the relevance of molecule exchanges along the simulation .",
    "moreover , we analyze which symmetrized wave functions can be implemented in dmc to the end of estimating the possible superfluidity and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of the solid with simultaneous accurate description of their energetic and structural properties . in particular , we have studied in detail a symmetrized trial wave function , named @xmath17 in this work ( the notation will become clear later ) , which has been proposed and used recently to study bulk solid @xmath2he .",
    "@xcite here , we find that @xmath17 also characterizes solid hydrogen in two dimensions accurately .",
    "interestingly , we assess the behavior of the one - body density matrix @xmath3 of p-@xmath0 with density by means of the symmetric trial wave function @xmath17 . in all cases ,",
    "a very small condensate fraction @xmath18 is observed . for densities below the equilibrium one , and near the spinodal point , a significant increase of @xmath18 is observed pointing to the emergence of a finite superfluid density .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : techniques ] , we present a brief description of the semiempirical pair potential and techniques used throughout this work .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : h2 ] and [ sec : d2 ] , we report our variational and diffusion monte carlo results for p-@xmath0 and o-@xmath1 in two dimensions , respectively . sec .",
    "[ sec : possiblesuper ] is devoted to the examination of the one - body density matrix @xmath3 obtained with @xmath17 and its dependence with the density . finally , in the sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we summarize the main results presented in this work .",
    "the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) molecule is composed of two hydrogen ( deuterium ) atoms linked by a covalent bond , which in the para - hydrogen ( ortho - deuterium ) state possesses spherical symmetry ( total angular momentum zero ) .",
    "the energy scale involved in electronic excitations ( @xmath19 k ) is orders of magnitude larger than the intermolecular one ( @xmath20 k ) , thus to model the @xmath21 ( or @xmath22 ) interaction by means of a radial pair - potential and consider the molecules as point - like turns out to be justified upon the condition of low or moderate pressures . in this work ,",
    "we have adopted the well - known and commonly used semiempirical silvera - goldman pair potential.@xcite this potential has proved to perform excellently at low temperature and at the pressure regimes in which we are interested .",
    "the ground state of para - h@xmath16 and ortho - d@xmath16 is determined using the dmc method .",
    "dmc is a zero - temperature method which provides the exact ground - state energy of many - boson interacting systems within some statistical uncertainty .",
    "@xcite this technique is based on a short - time approximation for the green s function corresponding to the imaginary time(@xmath23)-dependent schrdinger equation . despite this method",
    "is algorithmically simpler than domain green s function monte carlo ,  @xcite it presents some @xmath24 bias coming from the factorization of the imaginary time propagator @xmath25 .",
    "our implementation of dmc is quadratic ,  @xcite hence the control of the time - step bias is efficiently controlled given that the required @xmath26 extrapolation is nearly eliminated by choosing a sufficiently small time step .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath27 , describing our system is @xmath28 and the corresponding schrdinger equation in imaginary time ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 with @xmath31 an arbitrary constant .",
    "equation ( [ eq : schrodinger ] ) can be formally solved by expanding the solution @xmath32 in the basis set of the energy eigenfunctions @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "it turns out that @xmath32 tends to the ground - state wave function @xmath35 of the system for an infinite imaginary time as well as the expected value of the hamiltonian tends to the ground - state value @xmath36 .",
    "the hermiticity of the hamiltonian guarantees the equality @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a convenient trial wave function . as a consequence ,",
    "the ground - state energy of the system can be computed by calculating the integral @xmath39 where @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the local energy defined as @xmath42 .",
    "the introduction of @xmath43 in @xmath44 is known as importance sampling and its use is important to reduce the variance of eq .",
    "( [ eq : integral ] ) to a manageable level ( for instance , by imposing @xmath45 when @xmath46 is smaller than the core of the pair interaction ) .    in this work ,",
    "all the operators diagonal in real - space which do not commute with the hamiltonian , that is @xmath47 \\neq 0 $ ] , have been sampled using the pure estimator technique based on forward walking .",
    "@xcite essentially , with this method the possible bias introduced by @xmath38 in the mixed estimator @xmath48 are removed by proper weighting of the configurations generated along the simulation .",
    "in this section , we present a variational monte carlo ( vmc ) study of two - dimensional p-@xmath0 which provides us with the most convenient trial wave function ( twf ) to be used in subsequent dmc calculations and valuable physical insight on the system itself . in brief , the vmc method relies on the variational principle which states that given a hamiltonian the energy difference @xmath49 averaged over the probability density distribution @xmath50 is always positive and it decreases as the overlapping between @xmath38 and the true ground - state wave function increases ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the local energy defined in the previous section and the ground - state energy , respectively ) . in the present work , the main variational effort has been devoted to achieve an accurate description of the 2d solid phase .",
    "we have checked by means of vmc and dmc that in both p-@xmath0 and o-@xmath1 systems the triangular configuration is the stable one at all the studied densities .",
    "the energies reported in this section have been calculated at the density @xmath53  @xmath54  , which corresponds to the variational equilibrium density of the solid .    in order to determine the nature of the ground - state of the system",
    "we have also carried out simulations for the liquid phase . in this case , the trial wave function is of jastrow type , @xmath55 where the two - body factors @xmath56 account for the molecular correlations arising in the system due to pair interactions .",
    "these two - body correlation factors have been chosen of mcmillan form , @xmath57  , and as best value of the variational parameter @xmath58 we obtain @xmath59    .",
    "for the solid phase , an additional one - body factor is introduced _",
    "ad hoc _ in the trial wave function to the end of reproducing the periodic order of the system and so making the sampling over the space of configurations more efficient ( nosanow - jastrow model ) .",
    "such one - body factor consists in a productory of localizing functions centered on the positions that define the perfect crystal configuration ( sites ) , given by the family of vectors @xmath60   @xmath61 we have explored two different trial wave functions based on @xmath62  , each one consisting in a different choice for @xmath63 .",
    "the first model corresponds to the standardly used gaussian function , @xmath64 while the second is a pad function , defined as @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are variational parameters to be optimized . even though @xmath69 and @xmath70 are analytically quite similar , the asymptote of @xmath71 can be chose so as to decay to zero less abruptly than that of @xmath69 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : onebody ] ) .",
    "this feature can be used in the simulations for increasing somewhat the degree of delocalization of the molecules at the expense , however , of an increase of the kinetic energy within the surroundings of the equilibrium positions ( where @xmath70 varies more rapidly than @xmath69  ) . in table i  , we report the best energies obtained in the optimization process of @xmath62 with gaussian and pad functions for @xmath63   as well as the optimal set of parameters . as one can see , in both cases",
    "the lowest energy obtained is @xmath72  k  .",
    "it is worthwhile noticing that when the asymptotes of the pad factors are widened ( that is , the value of @xmath68 is increased ) , or equivalently , when the molecules are left to move more freely around the equilibrium positions , the energy of the system increases . given the variational equivalency between @xmath73 and @xmath70  , we opt for @xmath62 with gaussian factors and optimal parameters @xmath74  and @xmath75@xmath54 in our subsequent dmc calculations .",
    "at the density @xmath76@xmath54 . the decay of @xmath70 to zero is smoother than that of @xmath69 , and in the region around the origin @xmath70 is narrower . ]",
    "it is well known that @xmath62 is not symmetric under the permutation of particles ( that is , @xmath77 ) .",
    "this property is manifestly incorrect for a system of indistinguishable bosons .",
    "nevertheless , the use of the nosanow - jastrow model is widely spread within the field of microscopic calculations since it is assumed that the effect of symmetrization on the total and partial energies of quantum solids is practically negligible .",
    "in fact , we will show in brief that this is also the case for two - dimensional hydrogen . to this end",
    ", we have tested the quality of several symmetrized trial wave functions in the variational study of 2d solid p-@xmath0 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , our motivation for this analysis is twofold : estimate the influence in the energy of molecular quantum exchanges , and chiefly , study the possibility of its use as importance sampling in dmc to determine the possible existence of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) and superfluidity .    [",
    "tab : variational ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     concerning the structural properties of 2d solid o-@xmath1  , we have calculated the radial pair distribution function at the equilibrium density ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : deuteriumgr ]  ) , and the lindemann s ratio and kurtosis at different points ( see table  v  )  . as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : deuteriumgr ]  , the peaks of the radial pair distribution function of 2d o-@xmath1 are sharper and somewhat closer than in molecular hydrogen at equilibrium since the density and degree of localization of the particles are larger in the first case .",
    "this statement is also corroborated by the results contained in table  v  , where the lindemann s ratio is invariably some tenths smaller than in p-@xmath4 at the same density . as a matter of comparison ,",
    "the lindemann s ratio of o-@xmath1 at equilibrium is about @xmath78 times smaller than that of p-@xmath0 and @xmath79 than in two - dimensional @xmath80he  .",
    "furthermore , as it could be expected from our previous study of 2d p-@xmath0 ( table [ tab : lindemann ] ) , the kurtosis in two - dimensional o-@xmath1 is practically null in both the two orthogonal directions for which it has been calculated .",
    "a fundamental function in the study of quantum systems is the one - body density matrix @xmath81 , defined as @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are , respectively , the field operators which destroy a particle from position @xmath85 and create another at position @xmath86 , and @xmath35 is the ground - state wave function . in particular",

    "we use extrapolated estimators for @xmath90 since the pure estimation relying on forward walking is only applicable to diagonal operators . moreover , in order to get consistent results we have required that the two extrapolated estimators of the same accuracy , i.e.  , @xmath91 and @xmath92  ( where _ mix _ means obtained with dmc and _ var _ with vmc ) , coincide within the present statistical uncertainty .      at density @xmath76  @xmath54 obtained using importance sampling with the nosanow - jastrow and @xmath17 trial wave functions . _ bottom _ : one - body density matrix of p-@xmath0 obtained with the @xmath17 trial wave function at several densities .",

    "very interestingly , withers and glyde have recently shown by means of simple models that anharmonic and/or particle - exchange effects in quantum solids may cause the momentum distribution @xmath104 , or equivalently @xmath3 , to deviate significantly from a gaussian function .",

    "we have assessed several energetic and structural properties of both systems , like the total and kinetic energy per particle , radial pair distribution function , and lindemann s ratio and quoted so isotopic quantum effects in hydrogen .",
    "our results show that no stable liquid phase exists and therefore reducing one dimension with respect to bulk it is not enough to get the so - longly searched superfluid phase of h@xmath16 .",
    "interestingly , wiechert _ et al .",
    "_ have reported very recently on an experiment on molecular ortho - deuterium coadsorbed on graphite preplated by a layer of kr , up to temperatures of @xmath122  k.  @xcite the authors of this work claim evidence for the existence of a reentrant @xmath15 liquid at very low temperatures , based on their heat capacity and neutron diffraction measurements .",

    "@xcite further improvement on the modeling of coadsorbed systems , putting especial emphasis on the description of the interactions and the effect of corrugation with the substrate , may open new and challenging venues for the realization of superfluidity in p-@xmath0 and o-@xmath1 systems .",

    "<S> we study molecular para - hydrogen ( p-@xmath0 ) and ortho - deuterium ( o-@xmath1 ) in two dimensions and in the limit of zero temperature by means of the diffusion monte carlo method . </S>",
    "<S> we report energetic and structural properties of both systems like the total and kinetic energy per particle , radial pair distribution function , and lindemann s ratio in the low pressure regime . by comparing the total energy per particle as a function of the density in liquid and solid p-@xmath0  </S>",
    "<S> , we show that molecular para - hydrogen , and also ortho - deuterium , remain solid at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we assess the quality of three different symmetrized trial wave functions , based on the nosanow - jastrow model , in the p-@xmath0 solid film at the variational level . in particular , we analyze a new type of symmetrized trial wave function which has been used very recently to describe solid @xmath2he and found that also characterizes hydrogen satisfactorily . with this wave function , we show that the one - body density matrix @xmath3 of solid p-@xmath4 possesses off - diagonal long range order , with a condensate fraction that increases sizably in the negative pressure regime . </S>"
