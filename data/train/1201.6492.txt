    "when the graphene sheet is present , the interaction between the emitters is strongly modified at the subwavelength scale . in the limit of large @xmath8 , in correspondence with the distances",
    "where @xmath91 in panel ( a ) , the emitters couple via radiative modes and @xmath0 approaches @xmath90 . on the other hand , in the range of @xmath8 where the plasmonic coupling between the emitters starts to dominate , @xmath92 , @xmath0 deviates from @xmath90 , and , as the distance between the emitters and the sheet decreases , the system turns from subradiant to superradiant . for each value of @xmath4 ( @xmath93 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ev ) ,",
    "the value of @xmath87 where @xmath46 starts to grow from 0 to 1 , is the onset of the separation between @xmath0 and @xmath90 .",
    "thus , the superradiant regime , controlled by high coupling to gsp , can be tuned by means of @xmath4 . in the limit @xmath89 , where @xmath94 again and losses dominate , the interaction reaches @xmath95 , in contrast to the free - space value in this limit , @xmath88 .",

    "first , for @xmath112 m , we know from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) that the coupling to gsps is very efficient , @xmath75 , and @xmath113 .",
    "in this situation , the interaction between the two emitters is mediated by gsp , and , consequently , the length scale of the interaction is controlled by @xmath71 as opposed to the free - space interaction , dominated by @xmath32 ( dashed line ) . when @xmath114 , an analytical expression for @xmath0 can be obtained in the pole approximation : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the propagation length of the gsp , given by @xmath117 $ ] , and equal to @xmath118 in this case . as it can be seen in the plot , the analytical ( gray dashed line ) and exact ( red line ) calculations of @xmath0 coincide .",
    "since the propagation length is large enough , the decay length of the interaction is then given by the bessel function , that decays as @xmath119 .",
    "this is a dimensionality factor , coming from the fact that the 3d interaction in free - space is confined to the 2d graphene sheet .",
    "when the distance to the graphene sheet is increased , @xmath46 decreases and @xmath0 deviates from the analytical expression . for @xmath120",
    "m the @xmath46 factor is @xmath121 and the shape of @xmath0 reflects the fact that the emitter decays both to gsp and radiatively . finally ,",
    "when the distance to the sheet is large enough to have @xmath122 , such as @xmath123 m , the vacuum interaction is recovered .",
    "therefore , our results show that a larger interaction length scale and a modification of the super- and subradiant regimes can be achieved in a subwavelength scale for the appropriate choice of parameters .",
    "the tunability of graphene enables us to reach a regime where the interaction between the two emitters can be controlled at very deep subwavelength scales .",
    "although the tuning can also be done via @xmath4 , here we show a situation where the tuning parameter is the frequency .",
    "when the two emitters interact in reflection [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) ] at @xmath124 thz and @xmath30 ev , @xmath0 ( red line ) is very different from the one corresponding to the free - space situation ( black dashed line ) . increasing the frequency while maintaining the chemical potential , results in a larger momentum for the gsp , @xmath125 , which leads to a tighter confinement as well as a reduction in the propagation length .",
    "thus , the interaction varies in a @xmath78 scale , as opposed to the free - space interaction , dominated by @xmath32 [ fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) shows both scales @xmath108 and @xmath126 .",
    "the decay of the @xmath0 factor ( gray line ) , is given by the square - root decay characteristic of 2d interactions for distances shorter than the propagation length , that in this case is @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "for larger distances , losses start to dominate and the interaction decays exponentially , according to eq .",

    "the green line shows the exponential decay of the interaction . ]",
    "for completeness , we have also considered the possibility of confining gsps in 1d graphene ribbons , which could provide a platform for long distance entanglement between two emitters , as proposed in ref . .",
    "compared to the gsps propagating in a 2d graphene sheet at the same frequency , the ribbon - gsps have a higher @xmath96 vector , thus it is more tightly confined to the graphene layer . on the other hand , while the coupling of two emitters mediated by 2d - gsps is dominated by the dimensionality factor , @xmath133 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , it is expected that in the case of 1d - gsps this coupling will decay as @xmath134 , enabling long range interaction between the emitters provided @xmath116 is long enough .",
    "let us consider a free - standing graphene ribbon of width @xmath135 at @xmath136 , placed at @xmath137 with its axis along the @xmath138 direction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "we take @xmath61 thz and the fundamental mode of a ribbon of width @xmath139 m , that originates from the hybridization of two edge modes and has even parity of @xmath140 with respect to the ribbon axis @xcite .",
    "the field profile of the fundamental mode , obtained by means of the finite element method ( comsol software ) , is shown for two situations , where the emitter is placed at distances , @xmath141 m and @xmath142 m , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( a , b ) . for a distance to the ribbon of @xmath143 m ,",
    "i.e. @xmath144 , @xmath114 , the gsp mode is excited with a very high efficiency and its field structure is clearly seen in panel ( a ) . on the other hand , when the emitter is not sufficiently close to the ribbon , @xmath145 and it couples mostly to radiation , as can be seen in panel ( b ) for an emitter at @xmath131 where the field snapshot virtually coincides with an spherical wave . for the case with @xmath114 , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( c ) shows @xmath0 ( blue line ) for two emitters interacting in reflection through the ribbon - gsp .",
    "similar to the 2d gsp , a subwavelength modification of the interaction can be achieved . however , since the ribbon - gsp is much more confined ( @xmath146 ) , this modification can be achieved in a shorter length scale .",
    "moreover , propagation in 1d allows for a longer interaction range , with an exponential decay given by a propagation length @xmath79 .",
    "our results demonstrate that graphene ribbons could be used to control the length scale of the interaction between two emitters thanks to the efficient excitation of gsps .",
    "when analyzing graphene ribbons it is worth studying the transition across the the ribbon , i.e. , how the coupling between two emitters is affected by the presence of edges ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . for this reason",
    ", we consider the evolution of the interaction in the reflection configuration , the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( c ) , and also plotting the evolution of @xmath147 as a function of the lateral distance from the center of the ribbon ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "as sketched in the inset panel , we displace both emitters perpendicularly to the ribbon axis ( along @xmath148 ) , from the ribbon s center @xmath129 and passing through the ribbon s edge at @xmath149 , up to @xmath150 .",
    "as the figure shows , @xmath151 evolves from reflecting a high coupling to gsp at @xmath129 , to following the free - space interaction at @xmath150 , i.e. , @xmath46 goes from @xmath152 to @xmath153 in a length scale of the order of @xmath154 .",
    "additionally , we also study the evolution of the interaction between two emitters with opposite dipole moments in the transmission configuration for two situations and plot @xmath0 at @xmath155 as a function of @xmath148 in panel ( b ) .",
    "first , we displace the emitters simultaneously such that both of them are at the same @xmath148 [ see sketch ( 1 ) ] . at @xmath129 , the emitters couple to the ribbon - gsp and the system",
    "is in a superradiant state ( red line ) , as opposed to the situation in free space , that is subradiant ( inset panel , red line ) .",
    "when the emitters are displaced from the ribbon s center , but are still on top of the ribbon , i.e. @xmath136 , @xmath0 is only slightly modified .",
    "once the dipoles pass the ribbon s edge , the coupling to the 1d gsp is reduced , and therefore @xmath0 decreases .",
    "subradiance is quickly reached , approaching the free - space value , @xmath156 , which is achieved when the emitters are placed at a distance @xmath154 from the ribbon s center . in the second situation ,",
    "one emitter is kept at the ribbon s center and the other is displaced perpendicularly to the ribbon s axis [ see sketch ( 2 ) ] . in this case , the system is always superradiant for the distances considered : @xmath0 starts at @xmath157 and approaches @xmath48 , while in free space @xmath0 is of the order of @xmath43 at @xmath158 ( blue line in the inset panel ) .",
    "the reason for this lies on the fact that the emitter that is fixed always couples to the gsp .",
    "remarkably , with only one emitter efficiently coupled to the ribbon - gsp , the interaction between both emitters is very different to the vacuum case .",
    "our results for both configurations ( reflection and transmission ) demonstrate that the coupling between emitters mediated by 1d - gsp is very insensitive to the lateral displacement and that the effective lateral extension of these 1d - gsp is of the order of @xmath159 measured from the edge s ribbon .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the tailoring of the interaction between two emitters mediated by surface plasmon modes in a graphene sheet .",
    "we have shown that within a certain range of distances to the graphene sheet , the decay rate of one emitter can be fully dominated by the graphene surface plasmons . due to this efficient coupling , the enhancement of the decay rate of the emitter , or purcell factor , can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the interaction between two emitters mediated by the graphene plasmons in two - dimensional graphene sheets can thus be controlled at a subwavelength scale and can be tuned by means of external parameters .",
    "we have studied the appearance of the super- and subradiant regimes , both in the reflection and transmission configurations . additionally , when the interaction is confined to one - dimension in graphene ribbons , a longer interaction range between the emitters and a very deep subwavelength control of the interaction can be achieved . here",
    ", the lateral confinement leads to much higher enhancement factors , very deep subwavelength length scales for the coupling and longer interaction ranges . by considering the lateral displacement of the emitters from the ribbon s axis",
    ", we have also shown that the coupling to the graphene surface plasmons supported by the ribbon is very robust .",
    "our results show that both graphene sheets and graphene ribbons can be used as efficient platforms to modify the interaction between two emitters when they are placed in their vicinity .",
