    "a few remarks are in order .",

    "kroll potential is otherwise proportional to a dirac-@xmath162 function and generates an energy shift of the order of @xmath163 .",
    "the latter term is given by the high - energy ( short - distance ) regime not covered by our variational ansatz .",
    "namely , the atomic nucleus and the coulomb potential and its derivative , the coulomb field , vary considerably on the length scale of an electron compton wavelength , which exceeds the `` operational parameters '' of the heisenberg  euler lagrangian , so the result   can not be used for distances closer than an electron compton wavelength , i.e. , it fails in the immediate vicinity of the nucleus .",
    "one might wonder why the functional form of the long - distance tail ( @xmath164 for the wichmann  kroll potential ) is different from the corresponding term for the uehling potential , which decays exponentially at large distances ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the answer to this question is that the wichmann ",
    "kroll potential , which is generated by feynman diagrams with at least four electromagnetic interaction terms inside the loop , can be related to the heisenberg ",
    "euler effective lagrangian , which is valid for the long - distance tail of the potential , while the corresponding term , for the uehling potential ( with only two electromagnetic interaction terms inside the loop ) would otherwise generate a term proportional to @xmath165 that is absorbed in the @xmath166 renormalization of the electromagnetic charge  @xcite .",
    "hence , the tail of the uehling potential decays exponentially , akin to a yukawa potential , with a range of the potential being proportional to the electron compton wavelength ( sec .",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "after these intermediate considerations , we may proceed to apply our variational ansatz to a calculation of interest in the context of the subject matter of the current investigation .",
    "namely , for a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value @xmath167 of the axion - like particle as a dark matter candidate , the lagrangian  @xcite @xmath168 is exact up to possible qed or axion loop corrections ; in contrast to the heisenberg - euler lagrangian , it is not the result of `` integrating out '' the fermionic degrees of freedom which limits the `` operational parameters '' of the lagrangian  . hence , we are not at risk of exceeding the `` operational parameters of the variational ansatz '' when we use the axion background lagrangian   to calculate a possible correction to the coulomb potential due to dark matter physics .",
    "if @xmath169 is generated by a ( possibly distorted ) coulomb field and @xmath170 is the ( possibly inhomogeneous ) external magnetic field , then the lagrange density @xmath171 is redefined to read ( adding the source term @xmath172 ) @xmath173 the variational equation @xmath174 becomes @xmath175 in the absence of magnetic monopoles , the leading correction to the coulomb potential mediated by the axion vacuum expectation value thus vanishes , even for very strong and inhomogeneous external magnetic fields @xmath170 .",
    "one more remark is in order .",
    "the direct coupling of the fermion to the axion  @xcite is of the derivative form @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is a model - dependent constant .",
    "the yukawa coupling is @xmath178 and the `` fine - structure constant '' is @xmath179 ; energy loss arguments from the sn1987a supernova typically give bounds in the range @xmath180 ( see refs .",
    "this implies that a single axion exchange , or an axion interaction insertion ( e.g. , into the fermion line of a vacuum polarization diagram ) suffers from a suppression factor on the order of @xmath180 and is thus suppressed with respect to the corresponding photon exchange diagram ( coupling parameter @xmath4 ) by roughly 18  orders of magnitude .",
    "the fermion - axion coupling thus is too small to explain the proton radius puzzle .",
    "axion - mediated effects as well as weak interactions  @xcite can thus also be excluded as possible explanations for the proton radius puzzle .",
    "the presence of a very small fraction of light sea fermions , conceivably due to a nonperturbative mechanism , inside the proton , was recently mentioned in refs .",
    "one might counter - argue that the qed running coupling constant , at distances commensurate with the proton radius , still is small against unity , and that this precludes a nonperturbative mechanism leading to sea fermions inside the proton . in sec .",
    "iii of ref .",
    "@xcite , it is argued that the highly nonperturbative quantum chromodynamic ( qcd ) nature of a hypothetical electrically neutral proton receives a correction due to the electroweak interactions , as they are switched back on , and that , due to the highly nonlinear nonperturbative nature of qcd , this reshaping can be much larger than the electromagnetic perturbation itself .",
    "alternatively , one might argue that the fundamentally nonperturbative nature of the qcd interaction inside the proton might leave room for effects that can not be described by dispersion relations and perturbation theory alone .",
    "namely , due to the nonperturbative nature of qcd , the three valence quarks of the proton are supplemented , at any given time , by a large number of virtual sea quarks that emerge from the vacuum due to quantum corrections to the gluon exchange  @xcite .",
    "the sea quarks , as much as the valence quarks , are electrically charged , off of their mass shell , and may exchange photons .",
    "the propagator of these photons , in turn , receives a correction due to vacuum polarization ; hence , at any given time , the proton wave function has a nonvanishing electron - positron content due to the light fermionic vacuum bubbles .",
