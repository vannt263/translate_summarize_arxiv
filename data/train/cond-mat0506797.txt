    "the study of molecular motors has been transformed in recent years with the increasing use of single molecule experiments @xcite .",
    "in one key experiment an external force is applied to a molecular motor opposing its motion @xcite . typically , as the force is increased , the velocity of the motor decreases until it is completely stalled .",
    "the behavior of the velocity as a function of force provides much information on the chemical cycle underlying the motion of the motor .",
    "for example , the stall force is a direct estimate of the force exerted by the molecular motor .",
    "the experiments have also motivated much theoretical work on the dynamics of the motors @xcite .",
    "fitting the experimentally obtained velocity - force curves allows extraction of detailed information on the chemical cycle of the motor @xcite .",
    "most theoretical studies have focused on motors which move on featureless , or periodic linear tracks @xcite .",
    "such a description would be appropriate , for example , for kinesin which moves along a microtubule filament , which is periodic , using only atp for its motion @xcite .",
    "however , in many cases the assumption of a periodic medium fails .",
    "examples of motors which move on heterogeneous tracks include rna polymerase @xcite which moves along dna , ribosomes which move along mrna , helicases @xcite which unwind dna , exonucleases @xcite which turn double - stranded dna into single - stranded dna and many others .",
    "all these motors move along tracks which are inherently `` disordered '' or heterogeneous due to the underlying sequence of the linear template .",
    "theoretically , molecular motors moving along disordered tracks have received much less attention @xcite .",
    "another form of heterogeneity which has largely been ignored arises from the different chemical fuels which may be used by molecular motors to move along the track .",
    "for example , rna polymerase uses different nucleotide triphosphates ( ntp s ) which build the mrna it produces , each supplying a different amount of chemical energy , to move along a dna strand .",
    "a different `` annealed '' form of disorder ( in contrast to the `` quenched ''",
    "disorder embodied in a particular nucleotide sequence ) can be present even in molecular motors moving along perfectly periodic tracks in a solution containing several distinct types of chemical fuels .",
    "for example , it is known that kinesin can move using other nucleotide triphosphates ( such as gtp ) instead of atp , albeit less efficiently @xcite .",
    "recently , we have introduced a simplified model for molecular motors which allows the effects of disorder to be studied in considerable detail @xcite .",
    "we have focused so far on heterogeneous tracks and argued that near the stall force the dynamics of the motor is strongly affected by the heterogeneity embodied in a particular dna or rna sequence . due to the `` sequence disorder '' on which the motor is moving ( many dna sequences have only short range correlations @xcite )",
    "the displacement of the motor as a function of time ceases to be linear in time close enough to the stall force .",
    "the displacement becomes _ sublinear _ in time , growing as @xmath0 , with @xmath1 varying continuously from @xmath2 to @xmath3 as the stall force is approached . as discussed below",
    "there are also anomalies in the diffusive spreading about the average motor position which extend even further below the stall force .",
    "in this paper we review some of these results , stressing several experiments which could be performed to test the predictions of the model .",
    "we also explore the effect of heterogeneous fuels on the motion of molecular motors . in @xcite",
    "it was suggested that inhomogeneous fuel concentrations could enhance significantly the regime near the stall force over which anomalous dynamics is observed .",
    "here we study this type of disorder numerically and illustrate the dramatic effect of varying the concentrations of the different fuels used to power the motor . for motors moving along heterogeneous tracks",
    "we also discuss the dynamics in the extreme limit where detailed balance is violated and motors _ never _ take backward steps . finally , we consider motors moving along a _ periodic _ substrate powered by different kinds of fuels . we discuss , for simple cases , the expected velocity of the motor as the relative proportion of two different types of fuel in the solution is varied .",
    "the behavior of more complicated models is also discussed .",
    "in this section we define the model used throughout the paper .",
    "we start with a special case of the general class of @xmath4-state models explored by kolomeisky and fisher @xcite and consider a `` minimal '' motor with only two internal states .",
    "this simplified model reproduces important features of previously studied systems and allows us to explore generic behavior in new situations in a minimal form .",
    "the model is easily generalized to account for heterogeneous fuels and tracks .",
    "when appropriate , we will mention how results are modified for general @xmath4-state models .",
    "the model has been introduced and studied in detail in @xcite and here we only review its basic properties .",
    "we begin by assuming a perfectly periodic substrate .",
    "the location along the one - dimensional track , @xmath5 , is assumed to take a discrete set of values @xmath6 , where @xmath7 labels distinct @xmath8 and @xmath9 sites .",
    "although not essential , we assume for simplicity that the distances between @xmath10 and @xmath11 are equal and set @xmath12 , which is the size of a step taken by the motor after completing a chemical cycle such as hydrolysis of atp . in general , as discussed in @xcite , the distance traveled by the motor between internal states may be different for different internal transitions .",
    "however , we do not expect such modifications to affect the long time behavior over a range of parameters near the stall force .",
    "the dynamics embodied in the model is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : motor ] . internal states labeled by @xmath8 have an energy @xmath13 while internal states labeled by @xmath9 have a higher energy @xmath14 . the local detailed balance condition ( in temperature units such that @xmath15 ) is satisfied by our choice of rate constants , @xmath16 following ref .",
    "@xcite , there are two parallel channels for the motion .",

    "absent this symmetry , chemical energy can be converted to motion .",
    "these conditions are equivalent to those presented in @xcite for continuum models and are exhibited here in a minimal model .",
    "the effect of the externally applied force is simply to bias the motion of the motor in the direction in which it is applied .",

    "we consider , for simplicity , a solution with two types of chemical fuels within the simple two state model ( the analysis presented can easily be generalized to include additional fuel types ) .",
    "in addition , we generalize our model to treat two separate cases . in the first we assume that the internal states of the motor ( i.e. , the @xmath8 and @xmath9 sites in fig .",
    "[ fig : motor ] ) are independent of the fuel used so that the chemical fuels are only used to move between states with fuel - dependent potential differences driving the changes .",
    "this situation arises when the fuel from the motor is used and released so quickly that the motor is unbound to the fuel in the `` excited '' internal state . in this case the fuel binding to the motor does not define an internal state . in the second case we study we allow for additional internal states of the motor , depending on",
    "which type of chemical fuel is bound to it .",
    "this situation arises when internal `` excited '' states include a fuel bound to the motor . since the motor bound to the two fuels defines two distinct internal states , a direct thermal transition between them is therefore not possible . while both cases discussed below involve parallel pathways for transitions across a monomer , they are distinct in the type of internal states .    [ [ case - i - internal - states - of - the - motors - are - independent - of - the - chemical - fuel ] ] case i : internal states of the motors are independent of the chemical fuel ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    this case amounts to a straightforward generalization of the rates in eq .",
    "[ eq : rates ] to allow for multiple fuels .",
    "as mentioned above , we assume the internal states of the motor are independent of the chemical energy and that chemical energy is only used to assist the transitions .",
    "with two different chemical fuels , the generalized rates entering eqs .",
    "[ eq : b ] and eq .",
    "[ eq : a ] are now @xmath146 there are now three parallel paths , two assisted by chemical energy , one thermal .",
    "the subscript @xmath2 or @xmath72 refers to whether fuel `` @xmath2 '' or `` @xmath72 '' is being used for the transition .",
    "standard relations for the chemical potential difference @xcite imply that @xmath147 grows linearly with the concentration of fuel `` @xmath148 '' ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : dmu ] ) .",
    "because the extra channel is present , when one of the chemical potential differences is set to zero the model reduces to the single motor model but with modified rates as compared to a motor in a solution where the fuel is completely absent .",
    "for example , if @xmath149 the model can be written in terms of eq .",
    "[ eq : rates ] with the identifications @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "note also that , in contrast to disordered tracks where the motion of the motor is described by a random walker moving on a random force landscape , here the energy landscape is periodic except for a well defined tilt given by eq . [",
    "eq : de ] .    with the help of eq .",
    "[ eq : vel ] , it is straightforward to verify that for this model the velocity takes the form @xmath152+b'[x_2]}{c+d[x_1]+d'[x_2 ] } \\ ; , \\label{eq : ratio}\\ ] ] where @xmath153 $ ] and @xmath154 $ ] are the concentrations of fuel @xmath2 and @xmath72 respectively and @xmath155 are complicated functions of the the coefficients in eq .",
    "[ eq : ratestwob ] .",
    "the velocity thus varies as ratio of two polynomials , each depending linearly on the concentration of both fuels .",
    "consider , for example , the velocity in an experiment where one of the fuels is held at constant concentration and the concentration of the other is varied .",
    "the external force is set to @xmath25 ; ( varying @xmath35 did not affect the qualitative features discussed below ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fuel1 ] , the average velocity smoothly crosses over from a small value to a larger value in a sigmoidal fashion as the concentration of more energy rich fuel ( `` fuel @xmath2 '' ) is increased .",
    "note that @xmath156 varies _ logarithmically _ with the concentration of fuel number @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "thus , the concentration of fuel `` @xmath2 '' varies over many orders of magnitude for the range of @xmath156 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fuel1 ] . in typical experiments",
    ", only a small portion of this crossover may be visible . for small @xmath156 , motor movement",
    "is controlled by fuel `` @xmath72 '' while for large @xmath156 it is controlled by fuel `` @xmath2 '' . an analogous plot for motor velocity vs. @xmath157 when",
    "fuel @xmath72 is absent entirely is shown for reference in fig .",
    "[ fig : fuel2 ] .",
    "as expected , the velocity no longer exhibits a sigmoidal crossover between two regimes .     of fuel `` @xmath2 '' .",
    "the velocity is plotted in units where is size of a monomer ( i.e. , the lattice constant @xmath158 in fig .",
    "[ fig : motor ] ) is set to be one and arbitrary time units .",
    "we used a `` nearly one way model '' based on eq .",
    "[ eq : ratestwob ] where the rates were chosen to be @xmath159 in arbitrary units of inverse time and @xmath160 . for reference",
    "the velocity of with only fuel of type `` 2 '' with the same value of @xmath161 is @xmath162.[fig : fuel1],width=453 ]     where the other chemical channel associated with fuel `` 2 '' is closed .",
    "the velocity is plotted in units where is size of a monomer is set to be one .",
    "the rates were chosen to be @xmath163 in arbitrary units of inverse time and @xmath164 .",
    "[ fig : fuel2],width=453 ]    [ [ case - ii - internal - states - of - the - motors - are - coupled - to - the - chemical - fuel ] ] case ii : internal states of the motors are coupled to the chemical fuel ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    next , we consider a different model incorporating two fuels .",
    "we now assume that the type of fuel molecule used to move the motor determines the _ entire _ chemical cycle which leads the motor to move across one monomer .",
    "an example might be the @xmath165 motor landscape shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : motor ] where one step ( e.g. ; @xmath8 site @xmath166 @xmath9 site ) involves the fuel molecule binding to the motor . in this case",
    "the entire sequence of transitions would be dictated by the fuel that is used .",
    "thus , the choice of rates ( either in the forward or backward direction ) would be dictated by the initial step which is chosen at random , depending on the type of fuel utilized .    since the state of the motor",
    "is directly coupled to the chemical fuel , a pure thermal transition between the states is not possible ( unless it involves moving across the monomer through parallel pathways not related to the motor , an effect which is ignored here ) .",
    "the new feature is that the motor can move across a monomer by choosing one of two distinct chemical pathways .",
    "this is in contrast to the model defined by eq .",
    "[ eq : ratestwob ] where two distinct chemical pathways exist for passing between the internal states of the motor , but where the transition across the monomer can occur via a mixture different chemical ( or thermal ) pathways .",
    "an example for such a model , where each fuel is modeled by a distinct channel which is a special case of the two state model defined by ( [ eq : rates ] ) is given by : @xmath167 for the first channel and @xmath168 for the second channel .",
    "the fuel concentrations enter through the chemical potential differences @xmath169 and @xmath170 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : dmu ] ) .",
    "the relative fuel abundances therefore control the ratio of the rates @xmath63 and @xmath171 .",
    "the model will be realized physically in a motor which binds a fuel and uses its chemical energy in the transitions @xmath63 or @xmath171 .",
    "the transitions @xmath61 and @xmath172 involve the release of the corresponding fuel . here for simplicity we have set the energy difference between the states to be zero and neglected parallel thermal channels .",
    "we do not expect the qualitative results described below to be affected by such complications .",
    "the velocity of the model can be calculated in a straightforward manner and is found to be @xmath173 note that as in case i , the velocity behaves as a ratio of two polynomials which are linear in the @xmath174 , and hence with each of the fuel concentrations ( similar to eq .",
    "[ eq : ratio ] ) . also similar",
    "is the fact that the presence of a second channel alters the velocity even when one of the chemical potential difference is zero .",
    "again , due to the presence of the second channel the velocity is lower than that of the motor in the presence of a single fuel .",
    "we do not present plots of the resulting velocity as the concentration of one of the fuels is varied since the qualitative features are similar to those presented in the previous subsection .",
    "finally , we comment that more complicated scenarios ( for example , the existence of additional parallel pathways , or more general @xmath4-state models ) might change the explicit dependence on the concentrations of the fuels . however , we expect a general form of a ratio of two polynomials in the concentrations of the fuels even in much more complicated scenarios",
    ". indeed , with a specific experiment in mind and some structural information on the motor one might be able to use such experiments , coupled with an analysis similar to that presented above , to deduce the number of steps in the chemical cycle which depend explicitly on the fuel concentration .",
    "for example , we have considered models where the internal states are independent of the chemical fuel and found that the general velocity can be a ratio of polynomials of a degree which is related to the number of steps which depend on the chemical fuel . however , the detailed results were very dependent on the choice of rates made .",
