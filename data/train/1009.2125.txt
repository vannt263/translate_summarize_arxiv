    "over the course of the last two decades , there has been a groundswell of theoretical and experimental interest in ultracold gases of alkali metals confined in optical and/or magnetic traps .",
    "these systems of ultracold gases have proved to be extremely robust and tunable systems for studying condensed matter physics in regimes that are inaccessible in solid state systems  @xcite . during this time",
    ", physicists also became specifically interested in condensates of fermionic alkali atoms ( such as @xmath0 ) , and obtaining a _ bcs superfluid _ of cooper pairs similar to those seen in solid state superconductors ( bcs theory ) .",
    "if the effective attraction between cooper pairs can be rendered sufficiently strong , cooper pairs of fermions are no longer merely correlated and far apart as in traditional bcs systems , but have much smaller correlation lengths approaching the interparticle spacing .",
    "thus , they can be treated as _",
    "composite bosons _ , causing the system to undergo a _ bcs - bec crossover _ to a bec superfluid .    theoretical work on the single channel model of the bcs - bec crossover over the course of the late @xmath1s and @xmath2s  @xcite motivated numerous experiments with laser cooling and trapping of fermions , culminating in the observation of this crossover in the early @xmath3s  @xcite . in the late @xmath2s , the more informative _ dual - channel _ model of _ resonant superfluidity _ was proposed , by holland _",
    "@xcite , and by timmermans _ et al _  @xcite .",
    "this model , built from the _",
    "timmermans hamiltonian _ , is a generalization of the dicke ( tavis - cummings ) model in quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "the attractive interaction between the fermions can be controlled by tuning a homogeneous magnetic field to their _ feshbach resonances _",
    "@xcite , which are caused in a two - particle system by coupling bound states in a close channel with states in the scattering continuum .",
    "the effective scattering length can be tuned simply by varying the external magnetic field that controls the net magnetic moments of the different channels . in this dual channel model , sufficiently strong resonances cause bound states to form in the closed channel .",
    "thus , cooper pairs of fermions can _ physically combine _ into bosonic molecules  @xcite , entities referred to variously as _ composite bosons _ , _ diatomic molecules _ , or _",
    "quasimolecular states _ in the literature .",
    "these composite bosons have extremely long lifetimes near a feshbach resonance  @xcite , and repel each other  @xcite , facilitating their condensation to a _",
    "bec superfluid _  @xcite .",
    "this area of research has gained enormous interest over the last two decades .",
    "an overview of the phase portrait of a population balanced fermi gas can be found in  @xcite , and reviews of the current status of research can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of observing the nonequilibrium dynamics of coherent quantum states via _ quenching _ ( diabatic variations of the system parameters ) is one that is unique to systems of ultracold gases , and unavailable in other similar condensed matter systems .",
    "post - quenched dynamics in cold atom systems have been studied and reported . in particular , the _ collapse and revival _ of a post - quenched coherent bec state in an optical lattice  @xcite generated considerable interest .",
    "quenched dynamics have also been investigated for fermi - bose mixtures , experimentally  @xcite , as well as theoretically  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of observing a _ collapse and revival _ phenomenon as the system is quenched past the bcs - bec crossover has been raised  @xcite .",
    "more recently , nonequilibrium dynamics in condensed matter physics have also been described by the complex ginzburg - landau equation  @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear damping in the dynamics produces very rich and diverse behavior in fermi - bose mixtures  @xcite .",
    "the mean field dynamics of bcs superconductivity have been obtained from microscopic models via ginzburg - landau - abrikosov - gorkov ( glag ) theory .",
    "a similar approach has proven successful for bcs - bec systems as well , thus leading to their description by the tdgl equation for the single channel case  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the applicability of tdgl dynamics have been demonstrated in the dual channel case  @xcite .",
    "this motivates the use of this treatment to study the dynamics of coherent matter waves in bcs - bec systems in this report .",
    "this paper focuses on the dynamics of the tdgl equation in coupled bcs - bec systems , and the dynamics of quantum quenching therein .",
    "the most general state of this system across the phase diagram is that of a _ fermi - bose mixture _",
    ", where the composite bosons coexist with correlated fermions , and their dynamics are linked in the mean field by the two - channel scattering process through coupled ginzburg - landau and gross - pitaevski equations .",
    "the mixture is characterized by two distinct phases , the fermi ( bcs ) superfluid phase given by the order parameter @xmath4 , and the bose ( bec ) superfluid phase given by the order parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the fermi superfluid consists of distinct cooper pairs , and the bose superfluid consists of quasimolecular bosons .",
    "this 2-channel model is more faithful to the microscopic nature of the system than the single - channel model , especially when feshbach resonances are involved .",
    "the dynamics of the coupled bcs - bec phases is richer than that described by a single - phase model in the single channel case , since the ginzburg - landau dynamics of the latter is only the damped one except in the bec regime .",
    "this is especially true if the feshbach resonance is narrow , which is the case being discussed in this work .",
    "though many current experiments correspond to broad resonances , the consideration of a narrow feshbach resonance here is not unrealistic at all  @xcite .",
    "the paper reconstructs the time dependent ginzburg landau equations for the dynamics of a fermi - bose mixture in the two channel case starting from the many - body functional field integral for the timmermans hamiltonian .",
    "this hamiltonian describes the fermions by the bcs hamiltonian and the composite bosons by the bose - hubbard hamiltonian  @xcite , and includes a resonant coupling between the two species .",
    "the path integral is written as a functional of the superfluid gap parameter @xmath6 and the boson coherent state ( all of them are taken to lie in the zero momentum state ) @xmath7 , taken to be a c - number .",
    "the mean - field dynamics is subsequently derived , and the equilibrium densities evaluated at the stationary solutions .",
    "the paper then details investigations of the dynamics of quantum quenching , and reports the possibility of collapse and revival in the full matter wave of the bec at large times .",
    "section  [ sec : dyneqns ] begins by outlying the formalism that obtains the tdgl dynamics from the timmermans hamiltonian .",
    "section  [ sec : fpchempot ] reports the study of the stationary solutions of the tdgl dynamical system in 3 dimensions .",
    "the chemical potential and condensate fractions are evaluated as the feshbach detuning is varied adiabatically . section  [ sec : quench ] looks at the dynamical evolution of the bec ( which can be seen directly in the lab via time - of - flight absorption ) as the feshbach detuning is varied _ diabatically _ ( ie quenched ) to the shallow bec regime .",
    "concluding remarks are made in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the treatment that obtains the coupled tdgl dynamics of this system closely follows that which obtains the conventional tdgl dynamics of the single channel model , as applied by huang , yu and yin  @xcite . the formalism is applied to the dual channel case in a manner similar to the treatments by machida and koyama  @xcite , except for the nature of the bosonic states , which is approximated by a single mode .",
    "it is assumed that , at @xmath8 , the time - scales of the dynamics are sufficiently weak so as to not induce boson excitations above the ground state , an assumption justified in the context of dynamics in greater detail in the literature  @xcite .",
    "this approximation greatly simplifies the dynamics by removing any spatial information in the composite boson amplitudes from the beginning .",
    "this approximation also allows for rapid transitions near unitarity .",

    "this relation comes about as a consequence of renormalizing the bcs gap equation so as to counter ultraviolet divergences in the single channel model  @xcite .",
