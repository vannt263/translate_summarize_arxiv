    "the fifth japanese x - ray satellite , suzaku , was launched on 2005 july 10 into a low earth orbit of @xmath0570 km altitude and 32@xmath1 inclination @xcite .",
    "the satellite carries four x - ray ccd cameras ( x - ray imaging spectrometer - xis ; @xcite ) , which are placed at the focal points of the four x - ray telescopes ( xrt ; @xcite ) and covers the soft energy range of 0.212 kev .",
    "the satellite also carries a non - imaging hard x - ray instruments , the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) , which is the subject of the present paper .",
    "the detailed design of the experiment and basic performances in the pre - launch calibration are described by (;",
    "hereafter paper i ) , followed by brief descriptions of the initial in - orbit performance by ( ) and ( ) .",
    "the hxd consists of three parts contained in separate chassis : the sensor ( hereafter hxd - s ) , the analog electronics ( hxd - ae ) , and the digital electronics ( hxd - de ) .",
    "the hxd achieves an extremely low detector background through a highly ingenious structure of hxd - s , a compound - eye configuration of 4@xmath24 well - type phoswich units ( `` well units '' ) surrounded by 20 thick active shields ( `` anti units '' ) . in addition to signals from all of 36 units , those from 64 pin - si diodes inside the well - type phoswiches are also fed into the parallel readout system in hxd - ae , and the hard - wired anti - coincidence system drastically reduces the detector background by use of the hit - pattern signal from active shields .",
    "further intelligent event screenings are realized by the onboard software in hxd - de ( paper i ) .",
    "extensive in - orbit calibrations for all the hundred signals are crucial , to confirm that the instrument survived the launch , to optimize the hardware / software settings and the daily operation scheme of the hxd , and to verify the detector performance in orbit .",
    "we summarize the in - orbit operations in section 2 .",
    "the in - orbit performances of pin - si diodes ( hereafter pin ) and the gadolinium silicate scintillators ( gd@xmath3sio@xmath4:ce , hereafter gso ) are described in section 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "the spectral and temporal properties of the residual background are explained in section 5 . in section 6 ,",
    "we address other miscellaneous calibration issues including the angular response , dead time estimation , and timing accuracy .",
    "on 2006 july 22 , about two weeks after the launch , the run - up operation of the electronic system of hxd started .",
    "it took a few days to turn on the low - voltage part of the experiment , and upload initial settings of the onboard hardware and software .",
    "after that , an extended period of high - voltage turn - on followed over a week , in which the parameter tuning of the electronics was also performed .",

    "equation ( [ eq : gso_linear ] ) is thought to be accurate only in energies above 150 kev .",
    "if , in fact , equation ( [ eq : gso_linear ] ) is tentatively extrapolated to below 150 kev , it underestimates the pulse height of another emission line seen in the data , namely the 70 kev line originating from ec - decays of ( table  [ tbl : calline ] ) . as a result ,",
    "all well units were reconfirmed to show the expected nonlinearities with the same sense as indicated by the negative offset @xmath7 , but with larger deviations ( @xmath010% at 70 kev ) than was measured in the on - ground calibrations ( @xmath03% ) .    in order to represent the nonlinearity ,",

    "an independent confirmation of equation ( [ eq : gso_nonlinear ] ) has been obtained from comparisons between the pin and gso spectra of two x - ray pulsars with cyclotron absorption lines at around 3545 kev ( @xcite ) .",

    "in addition to the long - term trends , figure [ fig : gso_gainhist ] also reveals short - term gain fluctuations , which are anti - correlated with the temperature history of figure  [ fig : temp_history ] .",
    "this is because the gso light yield and the pmt gain both depend inversely on the temperature , with typical coefficients of @xmath16 c@xmath17 and @xmath00.2% c@xmath17 , respectively .",

    "it reveals a periodic variation by a few percent on a yet shorter time scale than that of the temperature fluctuation , synchronized with the orbital revolution of suzaku ( @xmath096 min ) .",
    "this is because the pmt gains slightly jump up when the high voltages are resumed after spending the off period in the saa , and then gradually decrease in somewhat unit dependent ways .",
    "therefore , the gains show almost stable levels in `` saa orbits '' which contain the high - voltage resets , whereas they continue to decline in `` non - saa orbits '' until the next reentry .",
    "this behavior is modeled by an empirical function , in terms of the measured temperature of hxd - s and the time after high - voltage resumption ( @xcite ) .",
    "the model parameters are adjusted , unit by unit , by fitting the actual gain histories . as exemplified by red curves in figure  [ fig : gso_ghist_short ] ,",
    "the model can reproduce the instantaneous gso gains , namely the parameter @xmath18 in equation ( [ eq : gso_nonlinear ] ) , to an accuracy of 3% as a function of time with a typical time resolution of 2 ks .",

    "nevertheless , the data still contain significant background events , namely residual bgo events at lower energies ( @xmath19 kev ) , and residual compton events at higher energies . in order to achieve the highest sensitivity to celestial signals ,",
    "the psd criteria must be further tightened and optimized in off - line data analyses , by discarding these background events as much as possible but retaining the signal acceptance .",
    "this process is hereafter called `` software psd '' .",
    "( 0.48,0.48)figure15.eps    in order to find the optimum software psd condition , @xcite analyzed the two - dimensional fast - slow diagram ( paper i ) of the crab nebula , unit by unit , after subtracting blank - sky backgrounds .",
    "they quantified gaussian - equivalent `` spread '' @xmath20 of the gso events on the diagram , in the direction ( @xmath21 ) which is perpendicular to its branch .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : gso_psd_sigma ] , the obtained width of gso branch , as a function of the energy , shows a good agreement with those measured on ground above 150 kev , while slightly broadens at lower energy range probably due to the in - orbit nonlinearity effect of the pmts (  [ subsection:4 - 2 ] )",
    ". then , the crab nebula data and the blank - sky background were screened in the same manner , using @xmath22 cuts where @xmath23 is the cut condition to be optimized . by examining how the residual blank - sky background and the crab signals change with @xmath24",
    ", it was found that @xmath25 , which corresponds to a signal acceptance of 96% , generally maximizes the signal - to - noise ratio under background - dominant conditions . through this optimum software psd",
    "cut , the gso background data transmitted to ground has been further reduced by 50% as illustrated in figure [ fig : gso_psdthr_spec ] .",
    "( 0.48,0.48)figure16.eps      after applying the software psd within each well unit , the gso background , like the pin data , can be further reduced using the anti - coincidence function working among multiple well and anti units .",
    "this screening is particularly useful in eliminating secondary radiation produced by cosmic - ray charged particles , and the 511 kev lines originating from @xmath26 decays of activated nuclei in the bgo shield (  [ subsection:4 - 1 ] ) .",
    "however , like the psd case , too severe anti - coincidence conditions would reduce the signal acceptance via chance coincidence ; accordingly , the conditions need to be optimized .",
    "as detailed in @xcite , the optimum anti - coincidence condition has been found to reject a gso event ( surviving the full psd cut ) from a well unit as backgrounds , if either of the following two conditions are satisfied ;    1 .",

    "it has at least two simultaneous hits in any units other than the relevant unit itself .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : gso_bgdrej_hp ] , applying this condition has nearly halved the gso background over the entire 50500 kev range .",
    "in particular , the 511 kev lines have been reduced to a level of @xmath00.05 ct s@xmath17 , because most of them are emitted in pairs from @xmath26-decay nuclei , and hence they produce double hits .",
    "the measured in - orbit sld ( slow - ld ;  [ subsection:2 - 3 ] ) rate is 1000@xmath01500 ct s@xmath17 per well , implying a chance probability of 46% for the surrounding 8 units to cause an accidental rejection of a valid gso signal .    ( 0.48,0.48)figure17.eps      in the same way as the pin diodes (  [ subsection:3 - 4 ] ) , the geant4 monte - carlo toolkit was utilized to construct the gso energy response function .",
    "this technique is particularly important in energies above @xmath6 kev , where the probability of signal photons undergoing compton scattering increases , and hence off - diagonal elements in the response matrix becomes significant .",
    "their analytic calculation would be difficult , because it must take into account the probability of a compton - scattered signal photon to be rejected either by the psd within the same well unit , or by the anti - coincidence with another unit .",
    "the monte - carlo calculations were performed employing the basic interaction cross sections and detailed detector geometry , as well as light yields of the three scintillator components ( gso , bgo bottom piece , and bgo top piece ) measured in pre - launch tests .",
    "figure  [ fig : gso_crabspec ] shows the gso spectra ( summed over the 16 units ) of the crab nebula , after subtracting blank - sky background taken on the next day .",
    "the backgrounds were extracted using the same `` good time interval '' conditions as the on - source data , that is , cor @xmath27 , elapsed time from the saa @xmath28 sec , and elevation from the earth rim @xmath29 .",

    "the fit is performed over the 100300 kev range , to avoid poor signal - to - noise ratio above 300 kev ( where the signal becomes @xmath30 of the background ) and insufficient tuning of the psd efficiency and other parameters below 100 kev .",

    ", the counting rate is also modulated from @xmath0100 to @xmath0400 ct s@xmath17 with a period of @xmath03000 s. its clear anti - correlation with the cor value means that the cut - off energy of cosmic - ray particles decreases when the satellite passes through high latitudinal regions .",

    "the former can be estimated again using the pseudo events .",
    "since the hit - pattern signals are latched when the pseudo trigger has been generated , in the same manner as the real trigger , the chance probability is derived by applying the same anti - coincidence conditions to the pseudo events as those utilized for the true events , and count the number of discarded ones .",
