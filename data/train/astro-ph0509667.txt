    "giant elliptical galaxies show a strong dependence of their kinematical and photometric properties with luminosity ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "traditionally the kinematics supporting the shape of ellipticals is parametrized by the anisotropy parameter @xmath1 which relates the observed ratio of the velocity along the major axis and the central velocity dispersion , @xmath2 , to the value expected for an isotropic rotator @xmath3 with the observed ellipticity @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "observed slow rotating @xmath5 ellipticals in general have @xmath6 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) and their shape is assumed to be supported by anisotropic velocity dispersions . in the following we call these systems anisotropic ( a ) .",
    "they tend to be the brightest ellipticals with boxy isophotes and have the oldest , most metal rich stellar populations .",
    "the bulk of their stars formed on very short time - scales ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "low luminosity ellipticals rotate faster @xmath7 and have @xmath8 .",
    "they are assumed to be flattened by additional rotation ( r ) , have disky ( sometimes boxy ) isophotes , younger stellar populations , and formed on longer time - scales .",
    "recently , observations as well as simulations have shown that disky ellipticals show a significant underlying velocity anisotropy @xcite . in this sense",
    "remnants with @xmath8 might be partly supported by anisotropic dispersions and partly by intrinsic rotation .    what is the origin of the strong mass dependence of the properties of elliptical galaxies ?",
    "does it fit into a scenario where ellipticals result from major galaxy mergers ? while the properties of low luminosity ellipticals are consistent with being remnants of early - type spiral mergers ( @xcite(nb03 ) ;",
    "@xcite ) it is for several reasons unlikely that high luminosity ellipticals have formed in a similar way : ( i ) the stellar populations of spirals are too young and metal poor and their formation timescales are too long ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , ( ii ) very luminous ellipticals are significantly more massive than typical spirals , ( iii ) numerical simulations indicate that kinematic and photometric properties of spiral merger remnants disagree with the properties of the most massive ellipticals ( nb03 ; @xcite ) .",
    "although equal - mass spiral - spiral mergers can form slowly rotating , boxy remnants @xcite they do , in general , not result in a homogenous family similar to bright ellipticals .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ( hereafter kb05 ) used semi - analytical modeling to demonstrate that massive ellipticals should have assembled predominantly in mergers between bulge - dominated gas poor ( dry ) early - type galaxies .",
    "they concluded that the observed characteristic properties of massive ellipticals might reflect the physics of early - type mergers which in this case should lead to predominantly boxy and slowly rotating , anisotropic systems , independent of the progenitor mass ratio .",
    "this would be in contrast to spiral - spiral mergers which produce boxy , anisotropic systems only if the progenitors have equal masses .",
    "the semi - analytical models of kb05 predict that early - type mergers also occur at low redshifts .",
    "these merger remnants would still appear old if gas infall and subsequent star formation was negligible during and after the merger events .",
    "some numerical simulations agree with the conclusions of kb05 .",
    "gas - free mergers of spheroids preserve the fundamental plane @xcite and the properties of the remnants are in general similar to observed ellipticals @xcite . however , a detailed investigation of the isophotal shape and kinematics of dry , early - type merger remnants was missing up to now .",
    "there is direct observational evidence for the existence of early - type mergers in galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also find clear evidence for this process in the field . comparing with merger timescales taken from the simulations presented here @xcite conclude that a spheroidal galaxy should have undergone typically 0.5 - 2 early - type major mergers since redshift @xmath9 .",
    "investigations of the evolution of the luminosity function of elliptical galaxies using various surveys show that the number of early - type galaxies with luminosities 0.5 - 2 @xmath10 has been growing since a redshift of @xmath11 accompanied by an increase of the total stellar mass in the early - type galaxy population @xcite .",
    "these observations support the scenario that massive galaxies assemble a significant amount of their mass even at @xmath12 by major mergers of early - type galaxies and accretion of satellites rather than by star formation @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we present the kinematic and photometric properties of simulated early - type merger remnants as a function of their initial conditions .",
    "we combine the outcome of our simulations with semi - analytical models and predict the present day abundance of anisotropic and rotationally flattened ellipticals .",
    "as prototypical progenitors for mergers between early type galaxies we use an anisotropic remnant of a spiral - spiral merger with a mass ratio 1:1 and a rotationally flattened remnant of a 3:1 spiral - spiral merger from the sample of nb03 .",
    "these objects resemble low and intermediate mass elliptical galaxies with respect to their photometric and kinematic properties ( nb03 ; @xcite ) and therefore can be considered as very good , but not perfect models for early - type galaxies . however , the mismatch in higher order moments of the line - of - sight velocity distribution of 3:1 remnants and observed ellipticals @xcite does not influence the conclusions based on global kinematics of early - type merger remnants presented here .",
    "we performed second generation binary mergers with mass ratios of @xmath13 and @xmath14 between anisotropic ( 11aa , 31aa ) and rotating ( 11rr , 31rr ) progenitors .",
    "the low - mass progenitor in the unequal - mass mergers contained a fraction of @xmath15 of the mass and particle number of the high - mass companion in each subcomponent and its size was scaled as @xmath16 .",
    "particle numbers were the same as in nb03 , resulting in 360000 luminous and 640000 dark particles for 11aa .",
    "test simulations indicated that the initial orientation of the early - type progenitors is less important than for spiral - spiral mergers .",
    "therefore we decided to focus on a variation of the pericenter distances of the mergers as an analysis of cold dark matter simulations by @xcite has shown that impact parameters of major mergers are larger than typically assumed in isolated simulations .",
    "for every initial setup the galaxies approached each other on nearly parabolic orbits with three pericenter distances of @xmath17 where the disk scale length of the more massive first generation spiral was @xmath18 ( see nb03 for all details ) resulting in 12 remnants in total .",
    "the initial separation was fixed to 30 length units .",
    "the simulations were performed with the treecode vine in combination with the special purpose hardware grape-5 @xcite .",
    "the gravitational plummer - softening length was the same ( @xmath19 ) as for the first generation spiral mergers .",
    "the particle orbits were integrated with a leapfrog integrator and a fixed time - step of @xmath20 which corresponds to @xmath21 0.2% of the half - mass rotation period of the first generation disks .",
    "the total energy was conserved better than 0.6% .",
    "every remnant was analyzed 10 dynamical timescales after the merger was complete .",
    "the isophotal shape and the kinematics of 500 random projections of each of the 12 merger remnants were analyzed .",
    "for each projection the characteristic ellipticity @xmath22 and isophotal shape parameter @xmath23 as well as the rotational velocity along the major axis , @xmath24 , and the central velocity dispersion , @xmath25 , was determined as in nb03 .",
    "the left panel of fig.[fig1 ] shows the location of the remnants in the @xmath26 plane .",
    "for every merger pair the projected remnants of the three orbital geometries have been combined .",
    "all 11aa ( solid line ) , 11rr ( dashed line ) and 31aa ( dotted line ) remnants have @xmath27 and show predominantly boxy isophotes .",
    "only 31aa remnants with a large pericenter distance , @xmath28 and 11rr remnants with a small pericenter distance @xmath29 can appear significantly disky ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "31rr remnants show distinct properties and have @xmath31 with predominantly disky isophotes .",
    "the distinct kinematical properties of the merger remnants becomes more evident in the @xmath32-plane which is shown in the right panel of fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "11aa , 11rr , and 31aa remnants are slow rotators in good agreement with observed boxy and anisotropic ellipticals ( filled squares ) .",
    "31rr remnants show stronger rotation ( @xmath33 ) and are located in the overlap region between boxy and disky ellipticals .",
    "this analysis indicates that unequal mass mergers of early - type galaxies can result in slowly rotating anisotropic systems if the more massive progenitor had similar properties .",
    "semi - analytical models are useful to quantify the importance of early - type mergers for elliptical galaxy formation and to compare the theoretical models with observations . the model used here",
    "is described in detail in kb05 . for the present study",
    "we adopt the following cosmological parameters : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "early type galaxies were defined by a bulge to total mass fraction of @xmath38 . all galaxies with smaller bulge fractions",
    "were defined as spirals . as the last major merger determines the final properties of the elliptical galaxies we show in fig.[fig2 ] the predicted number ratio of last elliptical - elliptical ( e - e ) mergers to the sum of the last elliptical - spiral ( e - s ) and the last spiral - spiral ( s - s ) mergers found in our simulations .",
    "the importance of e - e mergers steadily increases with increasing remnant mass .",
    "remnants with stellar masses @xmath39 are generally assembled by e - e mergers .",
    "our simulations predict that the @xmath40relation shown in fig.[fig2 ] is independent of redshift and environment .",
    "the only difference is that ellipticals reach larger masses in denser environments and that at higher redshifts the relation stops at lower remnant masses .",
    "a summary of the conditions , which are based on the numerical simulations presented here and in nb03 , that lead to anisotropic systems or systems with additional rotation is shown in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] where s denotes spiral galaxies .",
    "for example the combination 1r-3a denotes a merger of a rotationally flattened elliptical with an anisotropic elliptical that is 3 times more massive .",
    "this merger is assumed to lead to an anisotropic ( a ) early - type galaxy .",
    "all simulations so far show that equal - mass spiral - spiral or elliptical - elliptical mergers predominantly lead to slowly rotating anisotropic systems .",
    "it is therefore very likely that this will also be true for equal - mass mixed mergers between spirals and ellipticals . in the case of unequal - mass mixed mergers",
    "we make the conservative assumption that the property of the more massive progenitor dominates the structure of the remnant .",
    "we now can classify all the merger remnants in our semi - analytical models using the approach of kb05 and table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the result ( dashed line ) is compared to observations kindly provided by ralf bender in fig.[fig3 ] . as anisotropic systems also form in some unequal - mass early - type mergers the observed trend with galaxy luminosity can be reproduced . an even better agreement ( dotted line )",
    "is found if gas infall and star formation is suppressed above a critical bulge mass of @xmath0 , motivated by recent predictions of e.g. @xcite and @xcite . in this case , the growth of stellar disks by gas infall and star formation is suppressed above this critical mass limit , increasing the frequency of early - type mergers and by this enhancing the formation rate of anisotropic systems . a model which generalizes the s - s results of nb03 to all mergers ( dot - dashed line ) fails to reproduce the observed trend .",
    "binary major mergers of spiral galaxies alone do not provide a viable formation mechanism for the whole population of giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "in particular they fail to reproduce the dominance of anisotropic , slowly rotating and boxy ellipticals at high luminosities . a revised major merger scenario which in addition allows major mergers of gas",
    "poor early - type galaxies helps to solve this problem .",
    "individual numerical simulations of collisionless binary early - type mergers presented in this letter reveal an additional channel for the formation of anisotropic , slowly rotating ellipticals . in the context of hierarchical cold dark matter cosmologies this additional formation mechanism",
    "can successfully reproduce the observed trend that more luminous giant ellipticals are slower rotators and more supported by anisotropic velocity dispersions alone . a trend that matches observations nicely , if residual gas infall , star formation ( e.g. the subsequent formation of disks ) for galaxies with stellar bulge masses @xmath0 is suppressed .",
    "a threshold value like this has been proposed recently @xcite .",
    "we can also conclude that dissipation becomes less important for the assembly of more massive ellipticals as proposed by @xcite .",
    "the simulations also indicate that early - type merger remnants do preferentially have boxy isophotes ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , individual merger geometries also lead to disky and anisotropic remnants .",
    "further investigations will show whether this higher order effect requires the inclusion of additional physics like e.g. the coalescence of massive black holes .",
    "our analysis strongly supports a scenario where major mergers between ellipticals play an important role for the assembly of elliptical galaxies even at low redshifts . provided that the stellar population of the progenitor galaxies was old even the late assembly of an elliptical galaxy in a major early - type merger",
    "will not change this property .",
    "further investigations will have to show in how far this scenario is in details consistent with the redshift evolution of ellipticals and local scaling relations like the color - magnitude relation , the fundamental plane and the black - hole - mass-@xmath41 relation .",
