    "[ coupling_phase_space ] , the coupling between the ergodic slow modes of each dot , @xmath346 , is dominated by trajectories swiftly propagating from one dot to the other , _ i.e. _ , modes emanating at phase space points @xmath349 . *",
    "although this identification of fast modes rests on specific model assumptions ( no backscattering in the contact region , etc . ) , the result ( [ qdotarray ] ) is reasonably universal .",
    "for example , a somewhat more elaborate construction will show that the same action describes connector regions containing chaotic scattering and momentum relaxation by themselves .",
    "( the latter complication would manifest itself in an altered value of @xmath88 , though . ) generally speaking , the low energy physics of the system will reduce to @xmath350 , as long as the dots are isolated from each other in the sense @xmath351 .",
    "the effective action ( [ qdotarray ] ) is equivalent to a ` lattice version ' of the diffusive nonlinear @xmath14-model of quasi - one dimensional disordered wires .",
    "indeed , we may pass to a continuum limit @xmath352 where @xmath353 is replaced by a smooth field , @xmath354 , and @xmath355 the spacing between the dots . comparing to the standard form of the diffusive model,@xcite where the action is @xmath356 with @xmath357 the localization length , we are led to the identification @xmath358 .",
    "in the preceding sections we showed how a theory of anderson localization can be constructed for a sample in which the microscopic electron dynamics is ballistic , rather than disordered - diffractive .",
    "our theory of `` ballistic anderson localization '' paraphrases the scaling approach to localization in disordered quantum wires of dorokhov , mello , pereyra , and kumar,@xcite using the language of the trajectory - based semiclassical formalism .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the interest of constructing such a semiclassical theory is not the structure of the theory itself or the phenomena it explains . like most semiclassical theories of quantum corrections in the perturbative regime",
    ", the structure of the theory closely resembles the structure of its fully quantum mechanical counterpart for disordered metals , whereas the observed phenomena are the same in the ballistic and disordered cases .",
    "instead , the interest of the semiclassical theory is that it shows how quantum effects that were known from disordered metals arise if the electron dynamics is ballistic .",
    "on hindsight it should not come as a surprise that a theory of ballistic anderson localization can be constructed by adapting the derivation of the dorokhov - mello - pereyra - kumar equation for a disordered quantum wire .",
    "this point is best made by reconsidering dorokhov s original derivation.@xcite in this derivation , impurity scattering is treated in the born approximation .",
    "all quantum mechanical amplitudes are squared into quantum probabilities .",
    "hence , it is sufficient if one can replace the quantum mechanical probabilities by classical ones .",
    "such a replacement is a standard procedure when connecting quantum mechanical and semiclassical theories .",
    "its implementation for the array of chaotic cavities is what is done here .",
    "it is interesting to observe that , while small - angle encounters form a crucial link in our understanding of quantum interference corrections in ballistic conductors , their role is very limited in our description of localization in quasi - one dimension : they serve to cancel spurious contributions from trajectories that enter the last cavity of the array more than twice .",
    "( in dorokhov s original approach such processes are excluded automatically because of the condition that the length of the wire is increased by an amount @xmath359 much smaller than the mean free path @xmath86.@xcite ) implicitly , small - angle encounters do play a much more important role in our theory , however , because they help to preserve unitarity in the semiclassical theory .",
    "unitarity is a key ingredient of both the quantum - mechanical derivation of the dmpk equation and the present semiclassical derivation .",
    "we note that unitarity has played an important role in other extensions of the semiclassical framework beyond its previously assumed domain of validity : it is used to relate weak localization and enhanced backscattering , thus enabling a semiclassical description of weak localization without reference to small - angle encounters,@xcite and it is used to obtain an alternative expression for the spectral form factor , allowing its calculation in the non - perturbative regime by considering periodic orbits of duration below the heisenberg time only.@xcite    we have also shown that the dynamical information entering the semiclassical approach can be processed by different means to derive an effective low energy field theory of the system .",
    "this latter approach is based on the concept of ` modes ' , fluctuations in phase space decaying on parametrically different time scales . a successive integration over short lived modes stabilizes an effective action of the most persistent modes in the fluctuation spectrum . in the present context , that low energy limit turned out to be equivalent to the diffusive nonlinear @xmath14-model of disordered wires .",
    "while the field theory approach is arguably less explicit than the direct classification of trajectories , it enjoys the advantage of high computational efficiency , a paradigm previously exemplified on the problem of universal spectral correlations.@xcite for example , the above mentioned condition of unitarity , as well as the symmetries relating trajectories to their time reversed are built into the field theory approach from the outset ; there is no need for explicit bookkeeping in terms of encounter processes .",
    "the price to be payed for this compactness in the description is a higher level of abstraction , though .",
    "we thank fritz haake for bringing this problem to our attention . this work was supported by the packard foundation , the humboldt foundation , the nsf under grant no .",
