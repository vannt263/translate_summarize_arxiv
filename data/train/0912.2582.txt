    "<S> is information causality a new physical principle ? to answer this question , </S>",
    "<S> we first analytically derive the criteria of emergence of quantum correlations from information causality . </S>",
    "<S> then it is shown that , as emergence criteria of quantum correlations , information causality and uselessness of coupler - based non - locality swapping can be regarded equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , incapability of non - locality swapping using a coupler is as powerful as information causality in the single - out of quantum physics from generalized non - signalling models .    _ _ introduction .  _ </S>",
    "<S> _ quantum theory and relativity are the two foundations of modern physics . </S>",
    "<S> quantum theory is non - local , and relativity does not allow for superluminal signalling . from the perspective of gravity , proving </S>",
    "<S> the coexistence of these two theories is a great challenge for theoretical physicists . in the non - relativistic case </S>",
    "<S> , quantum theory must be a non - signalling theory , since one can access no information of any distant party only by local operations . to test the non - local correlations , a lot of  bell - type inequalities </S>",
    "<S> are proposed @xcite . in general , except stabilizer - type ( or ghz - mermin - type ) inequalities @xcite , a bell - type inequality may be violated by an entangled state , but never be violated maximally by any quantum state . </S>",
    "<S> for example , quantum correlations can violate the celebrated clauser - horn - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xcite up to 2@xmath0 rather than 4 . as proved by tsirelson , </S>",
    "<S> the amount of non - locality allowed by quantum mechanics is limited @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , popescu and rohrlich ( pr ) pointed out that such a limitation does not result from the request of relativity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the chsh inequality can be maximally violated even without superluminal signalling , and as a result of this , an interesting question arises , which is : is there a more fundamental principle bounding the non - locality in quantum mechanics ?    on the other hand , why not can quantum theory be more non - local ? as a significant property of quantum mechanics , </S>",
    "<S> non - locality plays an essential role in quantum information science . </S>",
    "<S> being regarded as physical resource of information processing , non - local correlations embedded in quantum entanglement can be exploited for efficient computation , secure communication , and some other tasks , such as teleportation @xcite and dense coding @xcite , which can not be physically realized without quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> if quantum correlations were more non - local , quantum information processing would be more efficient . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if the chsh inequality were maximally violated , which can be achieved by the pr box ( see later ) , some unconditional secure computations , such as one - out - of - two oblivious transfer , can be performed perfectly @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , post - quantum correlations take more advantage in non - local computation than quantum ones @xcite . even in the noisy pr box , </S>",
    "<S> the non - local correlations slightly stronger than quantum ones would collapse communication complexity , which are strongly believed to be non - trivial @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , from the perspective of information science , understanding what bounds the non - local correlations in the quantum mechanics is also important and interesting .    </S>",
    "<S> as previously mentioned , the non - signalling principle can not be the answer . </S>",
    "<S> several works focused on the generalized non - signalling models . </S>",
    "<S> wherein , their probabilistic predictions allow for many common features with quantum mechanics , such as no - cloning @xcite , no - broadcasting @xcite , and secret correlations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , like quantum mechanics , the non - signalling principle can be exploited for secure key distribution @xcite . however , these features do not distinguish quantum correlations from other non - local correlations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , it was shown that part of the boundary between quantum and post - quantum correlations partially emerge from coupler - based non - locality swapping , the analogue of quantum entanglement swapping @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therein , an imaginary device , called a coupler , is exploited  for joint measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> another potential principle is causality . </S>",
    "<S> initially , the relation between relativistic causality and tsirelson bounds was investigated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therein , it is shown that some joint reversible unitary quantum evolutions can be exploited for entanglement generation and even for signalling .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we focus on another kind of causality : information causality , which is proposed as a new physical principle by pawlowski et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> briefly , information causality states that the information gain can not exceed the amount of the classical communication , even if non - local correlations achievable in quantum mechanics can be used as physical resource . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , any non - local correlations stronger than quantum ones must violate information causality . </S>",
    "<S> information causality can therefore be used to specify quantum theory from other unphysical non - signalling theories .    </S>",
    "<S> is information causality at the very root of quantum theory ? </S>",
    "<S> the answer is partially answered by allock et al .. @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> based on the numerical simulation , it is shown that part of the boundary of quantum correlations actually emerges from information causality . in this letter , we study the relation between information causality and quantum correlations . </S>",
    "<S> we analytically derive the criteria of emergence of quantum correlations from information causality . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , information causality , as well as incapability of non - locality swapping using a coupler @xcite , leads to a quadratic bell - type inequality . </S>",
    "<S> we will show the equivalence between these two emergence criteria of quantum correlations .    _ the bipartite correlation boxes . _  before proceeding further , we briefly review the 8-dimensonal convex no - signalling polytope , which comprises 24 vertices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> each vertex corresponds to a bipartite correlation box ( hereafter , just box ) . here </S>",
    "<S> a box is defined by a set of two possible inputs for each of spatially separate alice and bob , and a set of two possible outputs for each . </S>",

    "<S> a mixture of local deterministic boxes must satisfy @xmath27 as for an extreme non - local box , we have @xmath28 in other words , the chsh inequalities can be maximally violated by these non - local boxes . </S>",
    "<S> as for the correlations which can be obtained by performing local measurements on a bipartite quantum system , we have @xmath29 in between the non - signalling polytope , the quantum correlations form a body with a smooth convex curve as its boundary . </S>",
    "<S> given a two - input - two - output probabilistic distribution , can it be physically realized by quantum systems ? </S>",
