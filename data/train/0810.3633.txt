    "supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ( sm )  or more generally extensions that require the existence of at least one additional higgs doublet ",
    "generate new flavour - changing interactions already at tree - level via the exchange of a charged higgs boson .",
    "the coupling of @xmath2 to fermions grows with the fermion mass .",
    "it is thus natural to look at ( semi)leptonic @xmath3 decays with a @xmath4 in the final state to try to uncover this type of effects . in a two - higgs - doublet - model ( 2hdm ) of type ii , where up - type quarks get their mass from one of the two higgs doublets and down - type quarks from the other one , @xmath2 effects are entirely parametrized by the @xmath2 mass , @xmath5 , and the ratio of the two higgs vacuum expectation values , @xmath6 .",
    "they can compete with the exchange of a @xmath7 boson for large values of @xmath8 @xcite . in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm )",
    ", the tree - level type - ii structure is spoilt by radiative corrections involving supersymmetry - breaking terms .",
    "the effective scalar coupling @xmath9 then exhibits an additional dependence on sparticle mass parameters when @xmath8 is large @xmath10 @xcite : @xmath11   \\left [   \\overline{\\tau}_{r } \\nu_{l}\\right ]   + h.c.,\\qquad g_{s}=\\frac{m_{b}^{2}\\tan^{2}\\beta}{m_{h}^{2 } } \\frac{1}{(1+\\varepsilon_{0}\\tan\\beta)(1+\\varepsilon_{\\tau}\\tan\\beta ) } , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 denote sparticle loop factors .",
    "the correction induced can be of order one .",
    "however , the access to the higgs sector remains exceptionally clean . in eq.([eq1 ] ) , @xmath9 has been normalized such that it gives the fraction of effects in the @xmath13 amplitude , which is very sensitive to @xmath2 exchange : @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath15 channel is less sensitive ( though better in this respect than other modes such as @xmath16 ) but , as we will see , exhibits a number of features that make it , too , play an important part in the hunt for the charged higgs  boson .",
    "the current capabilities of @xmath17 and @xmath18 to constrain @xmath2 effects are compared in fig.[fig1 ] for @xmath19 ( as is typically the case in the mssm or the 2hdm - ii ) .",
    "the lower sensitivity of the @xmath15 mode comes from the different momentum dependence of the higgs contribution with respect to the longitudinal @xmath7 one contribution for all @xmath20 values . ] : @xmath21 with @xmath22 . on the other hand , the theory prediction for @xmath18 suffers from large parametric uncertainties from the ckm matrix element @xmath23 and the @xmath3 decay constant @xmath24 . in contrast",
    ", @xmath25 is known with better than @xmath26 accuracy from inclusive @xmath27 decays , @xmath28 @xcite , and the form factors @xmath29 and @xmath30 describing the @xmath31 transition are very well under control , as we now discuss in more detail .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the form factors @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the @xmath15 transition are under good control . as a result",
    ", the ratio @xmath32 can be predicted with @xmath33 accuracy in the sm : @xmath34 , where the @xmath35 uncertainty on the scalar form factor at zero recoil @xmath36 is the main error source .",
    "this allows to derive useful constraints on the effective @xmath37 coupling @xmath38 .",
    "together with the constraints from @xmath18 , we obtain : @xmath39 , i.e. , the window around @xmath40 left over by @xmath18 is now nearly completely excluded by @xmath41 alone .",
    "these bounds should be strengthened soon thanks to the current considerable experimental efforts on both modes . in this respect",
    ", one should pay particular attention to the @xmath15 differential distributions as these are especially well - suited to discriminate between effective scalar interactions and other types of effects and , if the former are seen , to extract the coupling @xmath38 with good precision .",
    "it s a pleasure to thank my collaborators ulrich nierste and susanne westhoff .",
