    "ngc  2024 is a prominent h  ii region located in the orion b ( l 1630 ) star - forming complex , at a distance of @xmath2415 pc ( anthony - twarog 1982 ) .",
    "the h  ii region is sharply ionization - bounded to the south ( barnes et al .",
    "1989 ) . with a total flux density of @xmath260 jy at cm wavelengths ( rodrguez & chaisson 1978 ; barnes et al .",

    ", the required exciting star had not been identified , but bik et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have proposed that the infrared source irs2b is an embedded late o or early b star responsible for the ionization .",
    "a prominent dust lane is seen in optical images to run across the region from north to south .",
    "this dust lane is evident also in molecular line observations of the region ( i. e. schulz et al .",

    "( 1988 ) identified 6 small - scale submm condensations embedded along this dense ridge , suggesting that star formation is presently taking place here .",

    "2000 ) , mid - infrared ( haisch et al . 2001 ) , and x - ray sources ( skinner , belzer , & gagner 2003 ) are known to exist in association with ngc  2024 .",
    "furthermore , a number of submillimeter continuum sources were found and studied by mezger et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and visser et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . to provide a more complete census of the young stellar population in this region ,",
    "we have undertaken deep , high angular resolution 3.6 cm observations in an attempt to detect a cluster of compact radio sources similar to those found in orion a ( garay , moran , & reid 1987 ; churchwell et al .",
    "1987 ) , ngc  1333 ( rodrguez , anglada , & curiel 1999 ) , the arches region near the galactic center ( lang , goss , & rodrguez 2001 ) , and in ggd  14 ( gmez , rodrguez , & garay 2000 ; 2002 ) .",
    "we have used the very large array of the nrao in its a - array configuration to observe ngc  2024 at 3.6  cm . the region was observed on 2002 march 2 , 3 , and 8 .",
    "our phase center was at @xmath5 .",
    "the amplitude calibrator was 1331 + 305 , with an adopted flux density of 5.18 jy , and the phase calibrator was 0541@xmath6056 , with an average flux density of 0.748@xmath70.004 jy over the three epochs of observation .",
    "the data were analyzed in the standard manner using the package aips of nrao .",
    "the data were self - calibrated in phase .",
    "individual images were made at each epoch to search for fast variability ( on a timescale of days ) between the epochs observed . to diminish the presence of extended emission , in particular that originating from the very sharp ionization front of the h  ii region that is evident in fig .",
    "1b of barnes et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , we used only visibilities with baselines larger than 100 k@xmath8 , thus suppressing the emission of structures larger than @xmath22@xmath9 .",
    "the images were restored with a circular beam of @xmath10 , the average value of the angular resolution of the individual maps made with the robust parameter of imagr set to 0 .",
    "the three maps were then averaged to obtain an rms noise of 15 @xmath11jy .",
    "a total of 25 sources were detected in a region of @xmath1 .",
    "the distribution of these sources is shown in figure 1 .",
    "following fomalont et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we estimate that in a field of @xmath1 the _ a priori number of expected 3.6 cm sources above 0.1 mjy is @xmath20.6 .",
    "we then conclude that probably one out of the 25 sources could be a background object , but that we are justified in assuming that practically all the members of the radio cluster are associated with ngc  2024 . in figure 2",
    "we show the positions of the radio sources overlapped on the red dss2 image of the region . from this figure",
    "it is evident that the cluster of radio sources is closely associated with the central parts of the dust lane that runs across ngc  2024 .",
    "_    in table 1 we list the positions and flux densities of the sources , averaged over the three observations .",
    "we also note in column 5 if they were found to be variable or not .",
    "the number given in parenthesis for the variable sources is the ratio between the largest and smallest flux density observed . finally , in the last three columns we list counterparts , when found .",
    "a counterpart was taken as such if its position was within 3@xmath12 of the radio position .",
    "the radio positions are estimated to be accurate to @xmath13 .",
    "out of the 25 radio sources detected , 13 have a 2mass counterpart and 15 have a chandra counterpart ( skinner et al .",
    "only the brightest source in the radio cluster , vla  19 , had been previously reported at radio wavelengths ( snell & bally 1986 ; gaume , johnston , & wilson 1992 ; kurtz , churchwell , & wood 1994 ) .",
    "only 4 of the 25 radio sources , vla  8 , vla  12 , vla  17 , and vla  18 , lack a previously reported counterpart .",
    "of the 25 sources detected , 8 were found to be time variable over the observed timescale of a few days ( see column 5 in table 1 ) .",
    "we searched for linear and circular polarization in the sample and only one source ( vla 24 ) showed left circular polarization at the 3% level .",
    "we measured the angular size of the sources using the aips task imfit , with a correction for bandwidth smearing . with the exception of sources",
    "vla  8 , vla  13 , and vla  19 , all sources were found to be unresolved , @xmath14 .",
    "we found radio continuum sources closely associated with three of the six submm sources of mezger et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , namely fir 4 ( vla  9 ) , fir 5 ( vla  10 ) and fir 6 ( vla  14 ) .",
    "all three sources are relatively weak and do not show time variability .",
    "remarkably , none of these three radio sources have a near - ir or x - ray counterpart , suggesting very large extinction toward them .",
    "two close ( @xmath15 ) double systems , formed by sources vla  12 and 13 , as well as vla  15 and 16 , respectively , are part of the cluster .",
    "most probably they constitute physical binaries .",
    "this source has no reported counterparts .",
    "it is one of the few sources that is clearly resolved , elongated in the north - south direction ( see fig .",
    "its deconvolved dimensions are @xmath16 .",
    "these angular dimensions correspond to 170 au @xmath17 95 au .",
    "one possible explanation is that we are observing a thermal radio jet ( e. g. rodrguez 1997 ) that could be powering the unipolar redshifted co jet in the region ( richer , hills , & padman 1992 ) , since both the radio source and the co jet are well aligned and elongated in the north - south direction .",
    "however , the co jet seems to emanate from a point about 1@xmath18 south of vla  8 , a position much closer to vla  10 ( = fir  5 ) .",
    "furthermore , the detailed shape of the source is curved , unlike most thermal jets that are rather straight .",
    "this curved morphology is reminiscent of that seen in cometary h  ii regions or in ionized proplyds .",
    "it is known that the ionized orion proplyds , when observed in the radio continuum ( henney et al .",
    "2002 ) , show an arc - shaped structure .",
    "furthermore , the physical dimensions of vla  8 are similar to those of the orion proplyd lv  2 ( henney et al .",
    "clearly , additional observations are needed to establish if this radio source is a thermal jet , a cometary h  ii region , or a proplyd . as we will see below , the fact that the arc `` points '' to the region where the ionizing star of the region is believed to be located favors the identification of this source as a radio proplyd .",
    "this source has no reported near - ir or x - ray counterpart .",
    "it is associated with fir  4 , one of the small - scale submm condensations reported by mezger et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , and is thus likely to represent a deeply embedded protostar .",
    "it is associated with an infrared reflection nebula ( moore & yamashita 1995 ) and a unipolar redshifted co outflow ( chandler & carlstrom 1996 ) .",
    "this source has no reported near - ir or x - ray counterpart , but it is associated with fir  5 ( mezger et al .",
    ". it could be the powering source of the unipolar redshifted co jet studied by richer et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and chandler & carlstrom ( 1996 ) since it is located at the position from where this jet seems to originate .",
    "wiesemeyer et al . (",
    "1997 ) present interferometric 3 mm continuum observations , and show that fir 5 separates into two clumps , fir 5e and 5w .",
    "vla 10 coincides precisely with fir 5w .",
    "lai et al . ( 2002 ) studied the detailed magnetic field structure around fir 5 .",
    "these two sources ( see fig .",
    "4 ) form a close binary system separated by @xmath19 , which at 415 pc corresponds to 375 au in projection .",
    "source 12 has no reported counterpart .",
    "the source vla  13 is angularly resolved , with deconvolved dimensions of @xmath20 .",
    "its arc - shaped morphology and the fact that it points to the region where the ionizing star of the region is believed to be located favors , as in the case of vla  8 , the identification of vla  13 as a radio proplyd .",
    "this source has no reported near - ir or x - ray counterpart .",
    "it is associated with fir  6 ( mezger et al .",
    "1988 ) and could be the powering source of a compact bipolar co outflow found in this region ( richer 1990 ; chandler & carlstrom 1996 ) since the outflow emanates from a position coincident with vla  14 .",
    "both these vla objects are 2mass and chandra sources .",
    "they form a close binary system ( see fig .",
    "5 ) separated by @xmath21 .",
    "the source vla  15 coincides positionally with the infrared source irs2b , that has been proposed to be the ionizing source of the ngc  2024 h  ii region by bik et al .",
    "the source irs2b , first found by jiang et al .",
    "( 1984 ) and nisini et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , is located about 5@xmath12 north - west of irs2 .",
    "irs2 is the brightest near - ir source of this region ( detected by us as vla  19 , see below ) .",
    "the source vla  16 is not detected in the near - ir , but it is a chandra source ( skinner et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "this source has no reported counterparts .",
    "it is located exactly over the sharp ionization front that runs east - west ( barnes et al .",
    "it could be a bright knot in the ionization front , with no young star directly associated .",
    "this is the brightest radio source in the cluster , with near - ir and x - ray counterparts .",
    "it was reported previously as a radio source by snell & bally ( 1986 ) , gaume et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , and kurtz et al .",
    "we found no significant variability at the three epochs observed by us .",
    "however , our 3.6 cm flux density of 17.4 mjy is about twice the value of 8.9 mjy reported by kurtz et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , from vla observations taken 13 years before .",
    "this radio source coincides with the infrared source irs2 ( grasdalen 1974 ; barnes et al . 1989 ) . the radio source ( fig .",
    "6 ) clearly shows structure . there is a bright , dominant component to the west , with a fainter extension to the east . at present",
    "it is not possible to establish if we are observing a binary source , an ultracompact h  ii region , or a radio proplyd .",
    "multifrequency observations at high angular resolution are needed to favor one of these possibilities .",
    "this source is quite bright in the radio and exhibits large variation with a factor of 5.7 .",
    "it has a chandra counterpart .",
    "this source , with 2mass and chandra counterparts , is the only one that showed evidence of polarization , showing left circular polarization at the 3% level at all three epochs observed .",
    "it is also time variable with variations of about a factor of 2 .",
    "the combination of fast time variability with circular polarization is an indicator of gyrosynchrotron emission ( feigelson & montmerle 1999 ) .",
    "there are several mechanisms that can produce compact centimeter radio sources in regions of star formation . in regions of low mass star formation , thermal jets and gyrosynchrotron emitters can be present . in regions of high mass star formation",
    "we also have strong ionizing radiation available and , in addition to the two mechanisms present in low mass star - forming regions , we can have ionized stellar winds , ultracompact h  ii regions , and radio proplyds .",
    "it is possible to distinguish between these various possibilities with high angular resolution , multifrequency observations made with the required sensitivity . for ngc  2024 we only have available the 3.6 cm observations presented here .",
    "we can , however , argue that because of its time variability and circular polarization , vla  24 is most probably a young low mass star showing gyrosynchrotron emission . in the case of sources",
    "vla  2 , 5 , 6 , 11 , 20 , 21 , and 23 , their fast time variability suggests also a gyrosynchrotron nature .",
    "sources vla  8 and vla  13 are probably radio proplyds given their morphology and orientation .",
    "if so , they can be used in an attempt to search for the ionizing source of the region .",
    "these two sources are also affected by bandwidth smearing , but the deconvolution made correcting for this effect clearly shows that they are truly extended . in figure 7",
    "we show an image that includes these two sources as well as other nearby sources . in this image",
    "we have passed two lines by each of the sources .",
    "these lines have position angles of @xmath73 @xmath22 with respect to the perpendicular to the major axes of the sources .",
    "the set of lines defines a four - sided region that includes vla  15 (= irs2b ) and vla  19 ( = irs2 ) , as can be seen in fig .",
    "7 . given the uncertainties of the method , we can not favor either of the sources conclusively .",
    "we note , however , that the morphology of vla  19 ( = irs2 ) is suggestive also of a proplyd nature ( see discussion in section 4.8 as well as fig .",
    "if this is the case , then the object vla  15 (= irs2b ) is clearly favored as the ionizing source of the region , in agreement with bik et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . over the years , a few examples of radio clusters associated with regions of recent star formation have been appearing in the literature ( garay et al . 1987 ; churchwell et al . 1987 ; becker & white 1988 ; stine & oneal 1998 ; rodrguez et al .",
    "1999 ; gmez et al .",
    "2000 ; lang et al .",
    "2001 ) . in table 2",
    "we summarize the parameters of these radio clusters .",
    "although more such clusters should be studied to have a reliable statistical base , some interesting trends are evident .",
    "the diameters of the radio clusters are in the 0.2 to 0.7 pc range .",
    "the radio luminosity of the most luminous member is correlated with the bolometric luminosity of the cluster .",
    "we believe that sensitive , high angular resolution studies similar to that presented here are needed to establish if these clusters are always present in other relatively nearby regions of massive star formation . if properly understood , these radio clusters could be an invaluable observational tool to study the stellar population of heavily obscured regions of star formation .",
    "we have presented sensitive , high angular resolution ( @xmath0 ) vla observations at 3.6 cm toward the ngc 2024 region of recent star formation .",
    "our main conclusions are summarized below .",
    "we detected a total of 25 compact radio sources in a region of @xmath1 .",
    "only four of these sources do not have a previously reported counterpart at any wavelength .",
    "however , only one of the radio sources had been reported in the literature .",
    "we found radio continuum sources closely associated with three of the six submm sources in the region .",
    "remarkably , none of these three radio / submm sources has a near - ir or x - ray counterpart , suggesting very large extinction toward them .",
    "two of the sources ( vla  8 and vla  13 ) are proposed to be radio proplyds whose study may help pinpoint the origin of the ionizing radiation in the region .",
    "our attempts to do this suggest a region containing both vla  15 (= irs2b ) and vla  19 ( = irs2 ) as the area where the ionizing source is located .",
    "\\4 . the source vla  19 , the counterpart of irs2 ,",
    "is found to exhibit spatial structure , although its precise nature remains undetermined .",
    "we also detected a radio counterpart to irs2b , the source that has been recently proposed to be ionizing ngc  2024 .",
    "we have briefly discussed the parameters of other radio clusters found in regions of star formation and suggest that sensitive , high angular resolution studies of other relatively nearby massive star formation regions are likely to detect similar clusters .",
    "we thank will henney for his comments on proplyds and steve skinner for providing us with his list of x - ray sources before publication .",
