    "a random variable has a phase - type ( ph ) distribution if it corresponds to the time until absorption of a transient markov chain with one absorbing state .",
    "ph distributions , introduced in the early 1980 s by neuts ( * ? ?",
    "* chapter 2 ) , form a class of distributions with considerable modelling versatility , which results from attractive probabilistic properties .",
    "the set of ph distributions is closed under convolutions and finite mixtures , and is dense in the class of all distributions with non - negative support .",
    "ph distributions have therefore been extensively used in practice , in particular for modelling lifetime distributions , see for instance @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    the question addressed in this paper",
    "arose initially when modelling the lifetime reproductive success of the black robin _ petroica traversi _ , which is an endangered songbird species endemic to the chatham islands , an isolated archipelago located 800 km east of new zealand . by 1980 , the population of black robins had declined to five birds , including a single successful breeding pair , on mangere island  @xcite . through intensive conservation efforts in 1980 - 1989 by the new zealand wildlife service ( now the department of conservation ) , the population recovered to 93 birds by spring 1990 @xcite . over the next decade ( 1990 - 1998 ) , the population was closely monitored , but without human intervention .",
    "nevertheless the population continued to grow rapidly to 197 adults by 1998 , but after this period , the population growth slowed considerably and it only reached 239 adults in 2011 @xcite .",
    "the black robin population is modeled in a parallel studys .",
    "hautphenne , m. massaro , e. s. kennedy , and r. sainudiin .",
    "modelling of the chatham island black robin _ petroica traversi _ populations using branching processes : informed management strategies for reintroduction of endangered species . in preparation ] using a special class of branching processes called the markovian binary tree ( mbt ) , in which an underlying transient markov chain controls the reproduction and death events of each individual in the population .",
    "a direct consequence of this model is that each bird lives for a random time which has a ph distribution , in which it progresses through states ( also called phases ) of a continuous - time markov chain and dies when the chain moves to an absorbing state . in this application ,",
    "the phases do not have any particular physical interpretation , their role is to increase the accuracy and realism of the mbt model , as opposed to the simplest linear birth - and - death model . in other real - world applications",
    ", the phases may have a physical meaning , such as in @xcite where they model physiological ages , which can be interpreted as relative health indices , as opposed to chronological age .",
    "mbts have proved to be powerful stochastic models in population biology and demography @xcite .",
    "having fitted an mbt to real data , we can calculate properties of the population , such as the probability that it will become extinct in some time interval @xmath0 $ ] , and the distribution of the population size at time @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , the model allows us to compute the expected number of birds in phase @xmath2 at time @xmath1 , and the asymptotic frequency of phase @xmath2 in the population .",
    "however , the latter two quantities may not have significance for biologists , who are likely to be interested in age - specific , rather than phase - specific , properties of individuals .",
    "we therefore need to be able to translate information about the phase distribution into information about the age distribution ; that is , we need to answer the question `` _ _ what is the age distribution of a bird , given its phase _ _ '' ?",
    "note that the reverse exercise of translating information about age into information about phase is much easier since the distribution of the phase at any given age is well known .",
    "the main difference is that age is deterministic , while phase is random and an individual stays in a given phase for an exponentially distributed amount of time .",
    "in fact , defining the event that an individual is in phase @xmath2 is already not trivial .",
    "it is necessary to describe in more detail how the individual is sampled .",
    "we suggest three sampling schemes according to which an observer looks at the phase of an individual :    * first , we assume that individuals are born according to a poisson process which started infinitely far in the past , and one observes the phase of a randomly selected individual at time 0 ; * second , no assumption is made on the birth process , and the observations of individuals occur according to a poisson process , in which case we allow a single or multiple observation(s ) ; * third , a single observation occurs at a uniformly distributed random time within some time window .    for each observation scheme ,",
    "we compute the conditional age distribution given the observed phase , as well as related quantities .",
    "we show that the age distribution conditional on a single rare poisson phase observation coincides with the age distribution conditional on a single rare uniform phase observation .",
    "moreover , this age - distribution also corresponds to the age distribution of a randomly selected bird in a given phase at time 0 in the process where individuals are born according to a poisson process .",
    "the questions addressed in this paper , and their proposed answers , are not restricted to the context of ph distributions and ageing processes ; they have a wider interest in markov chain theory . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath3 is the generator of a continuous - time markov chain @xmath4 , then it is well known that @xmath5=[\\exp(qt)]_{ij}$ ] , but the conditional distribution of the time @xmath1 elapsed since the start of the markov chain , given that the chain is observed in phase @xmath2 is much less explored . as we observed above , the nature of this observation event needs to be described carefully .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we provide some background on ph distributions used to model the ageing process of individuals . in section 3 , we compute the conditional age distribution at time 0 in the poisson birth process , given the observed phase . in section 4 , we consider the poisson phase observation scheme and provide the conditional age distribution with a single or multiple observation(s ) . in section 5 , we consider a uniform observation scheme , and in section 6 we discuss the rare observation limit of the results obtained in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "finally , in section 7 , we illustrate our results on a toy example first , and then on the computation of the age pyramid for the black robin population .",
    "we assume that the lifetime of an individual is a random variable @xmath6 which follows a phase - type ph@xmath7 distribution with @xmath8 transient phases @xmath9 and the absorbing phase 0 .",
    "this ph distribution is parameterised by an @xmath10 vector @xmath11 which gives us the initial distribution of the underlying markov chain , and an @xmath12 matrix @xmath13 containing the transition rates between the transient phases .",
    "so the assumption is that the lifetime of an individual progresses through phases ( which may or may not correspond to some physically - observable characteristics ) according to a realisation of the markov chain , and the individual dies when the chain moves to the absorbing phase 0 .    the ph@xmath14 distributed random variable @xmath6 has a density and a distribution function respectively given by @xmath15&=&1- { \\boldsymbol{\\alpha } } e^{{\\bf q}x}{\\boldsymbol{1}},\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath16 is the absorption rate vector , and @xmath17 is a column vector of ones .",
    "let @xmath18 denote the phase of the individual at age @xmath19 , and let @xmath2 be any transient phase .",
    "another basic result on ph random variables tells us that the probability that an individual is in phase @xmath2 when its age is @xmath19 is @xmath20={\\textrm{p}}[\\varphi(x)=j]=({\\boldsymbol{\\alpha } } e^{{\\bf q}x})_j={\\boldsymbol{\\alpha } } e^{{\\bf q}x}{\\boldsymbol{e}}_j,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the @xmath2th unit ( column ) vector . our question is the reverse of this : `` _ _",
    "if we observe an individual in phase j , what can we say about its age ? _ _ ''",
    "bayes theorem gives us @xmath22 = \\dfrac{{\\textrm{p}}[\\mbox{phase}=j\\,|\\,\\mbox{age}\\leq x]\\,{\\textrm{p}}[\\mbox{age}\\leq x]}{{\\textrm{p}}[\\mbox{phase}=j]}.\\ ] ] the problem is that we do not yet have anything in the model to make sense of @xmath23 $ ] and @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "our aim is in this paper is to find satisfying answers to the above question .",
    "one assumption that we might make is that individuals have been born at the epochs of a poisson process with parameter @xmath25 over the time interval @xmath26 , and that we observe the phase of a single individual randomly taken from the population at time 0 .",
    "let @xmath27 be the probability that the age of the randomly - selected individual in phase @xmath2 at time 0 is smaller than @xmath28 .",
    "[ pbirth]for any @xmath29 , @xmath30    _ proof .",
    "_ for any @xmath31 ,    * the number @xmath32 of individuals born in the time interval @xmath33 has a poisson distribution with parameter @xmath34 , * conditional on @xmath35 , the birthtimes of the @xmath36 individuals are uniformly and independently distributed on the interval @xmath33 , * an individual born at time @xmath37 will be alive at time 0 with probability @xmath38 by .",
    "so , an individual born in the interval @xmath33 will be alive at time 0 with probability @xmath39 it will be alive and in phase @xmath2 at time 0 with probability @xmath40 and it will be alive , in phase @xmath2 and older than @xmath28 at time 0 with probability @xmath41 so the probability that an individual in phase @xmath2 at time 0 is older than @xmath28 is @xmath42 the fact that any ph distribution has a finite mean allows us to let @xmath43 and , changing the variable of integration , we arrive at the conclusion that the probability that a randomly - selected individual in phase @xmath2 at time 0 is older than @xmath28 is @xmath44which completes the proof.@xmath45    note that this model corresponds to an @xmath46 queue , and gives the distribution of the age of a randomly selected individual in steady state . also observe that @xmath27 does not depend on the rate @xmath25 of the poisson birth process .",
    "the above analysis is nice .",
    "however the birth process in an mbt is not poisson and , more generally , there is no reason to believe that a poisson process is a good model for births . in the next three sections , we shall follow an alternative approach : without making any assumption on the birth process , we look at just a single individual and proceed by explicitly putting the observation process into the model .    for further use , we denote the age of the individual at the time of observation as @xmath47 and the observed phase as @xmath48 .",
    "we are therefore interested in computing @xmath49.\\ ] ]",
    "in this section , we assume that , following its birth , the phase of an individual is observed according to a poisson process with rate @xmath50 .",
    "we first compute the age distribution given the phase at the first observation time .",
    "then we generalise our results to the age distribution at the time of the last observation , given that the observer records the phases at @xmath51 successive time events of the poisson process .      by the properties of poisson processes , the rate at which an individual is observed when it is in phase @xmath2 is @xmath50 , for any @xmath2 .",
    "a slight modification of the underlying phase process then allows us to compute the conditional age distribution of the individual at the first observation time , given that the individual is in phase @xmath52 at that time .",
    "it suffices to add @xmath8 absorbing phases @xmath53 ( one per transient phase ) , to the process so that phase @xmath54 is reached when the individual is observed in phase @xmath2 .",
    "the initial distribution @xmath11 stays unchanged , but now the transition rate matrix becomes @xmath55 and there are @xmath56 absorption rate vectors @xmath57 where @xmath58 records the rates of absorption into phase 0 ( corresponding to the death of the individual ) , and for @xmath59 , @xmath60 records the rates of absorption into phase @xmath54 ( corresponding to the observation of the individual in phase @xmath2 ) . for the sake of clarity of the presentation , we shall drop the dependence on @xmath50 in @xmath61 and @xmath62 and use the simpler notation @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the sequel .    for any phase @xmath2 ( transient or absorbing ) , let @xmath65 be first time the individual enters phase @xmath2 , with @xmath66 if the individual never enters phase @xmath2 . then , with probability one , precisely one of the random variables @xmath67 is finite , and the age distribution conditional on the observed phase being @xmath2 can be rewritten as @xmath68={\\textrm{p}}[b(j')\\leq s \\,|\\,b(j')<\\infty].\\ ] ] based on this observation , the next proposition provides an expression for the conditional age distribution .",
