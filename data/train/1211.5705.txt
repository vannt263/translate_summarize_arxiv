    "the united states department of agriculture ( usda ) maintains a large crop insurance program extending to billions of dollars @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , some claims are bound to be fraudulent , and frequently they are related through groups of farmers who act in collusion , extending to conspiring agents , even insurance companies @xcite .",
    "naturally it is desirable to contain this fraud , and there is a need for a good understanding of where actual storm damage has occurred , and to what extent .    to gain a better understanding of hail storm damages , this study investigates the damage to agricultural crops by hail storms , and the pursuant insurance claims .",
    "such claims routinely refer to the distance from the storm center , and are known to respond to countervailing influences .",
    "storm damage occurs with greatest intensity at the center , tapering to insignificance at distance .",
    "however , the total of claims filed for damage at the center is small , and increases as more and more claimants reside at greater distances from the center .",
    "the total claim value consequently increases from zero as a function of distance to a single mode , and then decreases again to zero .",
    "the research question , therefore , is , `` what model based on fundamentals faithfully replicates this experience ? '' the proposed distribution answers this question with parsimony , and is herewith advanced .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the upcoming section analyzes the log - normal distribution model , which was previously used to describe hail storm damage @xcite .",
    "the following section discusses the 2-dimensional case , under the simplifying assumption that the hail storm does not move over the landscape .",
    "the model is that of the independent bivariate normal probability measure of damage intensity .",
    "insofar as damage intensity is independent of direction from the storm center there is only one independent variable  the radial distance from the center .",
    "the resulting marginal distribution on the identity random variable of radius is the @xmath0-distribution . in the next section",
    "we extend the model to the traveling form , introducing dependence in the bivariate normal probability measure , and subsequently extend this to the multivariate case .",
    "the final phase of the study applies the model to extensive data sets of hail events and their ` severe probabilities , ' as detected by the nexrad network of weather radars .",
    "hail storms can give rise to various forms of damage , including damage to motor vehicles @xcite and to agriculture . in the context of agriculture",
    ", the log - normal distribution has been used to describe insurance claim data @xcite .",
    "although this distribution fits the data reasonably well , we show that there is a theoretical objection to using the log - normal distribution .",
    "the log - normal distribution with parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 has density function @xcite @xmath3 and distribution function @xmath4 with @xmath5 the standard normal distribution function .",
    "suppose that @xmath6 is the marginal probability density function in the radial direction of some joint density @xmath7 of random variables @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the damage density at the center can be expressed as the average density over a small disc centered at the center , that is , @xmath10 where the last equality follows by applying lhpital s rule .",
    "in other words , the log - normal distribution corresponds to a damage pattern with zero damage density in the center , which is unlikely to be the case for a hail storm .",
    "this might , however , be desirable for other kinds of storms , like tornados and hurricanes .",
    "if the log - normal distribution is unfit for describing damages , what other distribution is suitable ? we make the following desirable assumptions in the damage pattern of a hail storm .",
    "the damage function is unimodal at the center , smooth , dependent only on the distance from the center , and scalable to a probability density function .",
    "the simplest distribution with these attributes is the standard bivariate normal , or simply binormal , distribution .",
    "we consider the standard probability space @xmath11 , wherein the first component is the euclidean plane , the second the borel sigma algebra , and the third is the binormal independent probability measure .",
    "equip the plane with cartesian coordinates @xmath12 and polar coordinates @xmath13 and define a random variable @xmath8 as the identity function on the radial coordinate @xmath14 , independent of @xmath15 .",
    "thus @xmath8 graphs to an inverted cone with apex at the origin of the plane .",
    "one also may define the random variable @xmath16 as the identity on the angular coordinate @xmath15 , independent of @xmath14 .",
    "this variable has the uniform distribution .",
    "the usual euclidian expression of the density of the binormal distribution , founded on the identity random variables @xmath17 on the respective axes with variables @xmath12 , is @xmath18    our attention turns to the distribution of the storm damage as distance from the storm center , insofar as the intensity is independent of the direction from the center .",
    "the marginal distribution of @xmath8 in these circumstances is @xmath19 this is the familiar @xmath0-distribution with two degrees of freedom .",
    "let us assume that at any moment in time , the _ damage density _",
    "@xmath20 at the location @xmath21 of a hail storm is binormally distributed , that is , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the _ center _ of the hail storm and @xmath24 is the euclidean norm . during the storm ,",
    "let us assume that the center moves with a constant velocity vector @xmath25 .",
    "choosing coordinates @xmath26 such that the center is at the origin @xmath27 at time @xmath28 , the trajectory of the center is then given by @xmath29 .",
    "the _ intensity _",
    "@xmath30 of the storm at time @xmath31 is assumed to be normal , @xmath32 with the time coordinate chosen such that the peak intensity happens at time @xmath28 .",
    "after scaling the time coordinate by a factor @xmath2 , we can assume that @xmath33 .    under these assumptions , the _ total damage density _",
    "@xmath34 at the point @xmath26 is given by the marginal density @xmath35 the integral can be computed by completing the square .",
    "writing @xmath36 with @xmath37 the standard inner product , one finds that the total damage @xmath38 is also binormally distributed , but now with a correlation in its random vector . to bring this density in standard form , write @xmath39 and introduce the parameters @xmath40 then @xmath41 which is the standard form of the bivariate normal distribution with zero mean and covariance matrix @xmath42",
    "as for the standard binormal distribution in section [ sec : binormal ] , we wish to reduce the dimension of the damage density @xmath34 , so as to cancel out fluctuations in the data and arrive at a more regular and simpler distribution .",
    "the damage density , with general covariance matrix @xmath43 , is no longer constant in the angular direction .",
    "it is therefore natural to change to a coordinate system in which the damage density becomes standard binormal , before reducing the dimension .",
    "we choose to perform this process for a general multinormal distribution , as this is not much harder than the bivariate case and might be used for other modeling purposes .",
    "suppose a random vector @xmath44 on @xmath45 is multivariate normally distributed with density function @xmath46 with mean @xmath47 and covariance matrix @xmath43 of full rank @xmath48 . if we are given data @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the frequency of the event @xmath51 , one has the maximum likelihood estimators @xmath52 @xmath53 for the parameters @xmath47 , @xmath43 .    while the independent binormal distribution has angular symmetry with respect to its center , this is no longer the case for the general multinormal distribution . to reduce to a univariate distribution",
    ", we introduce a distance function that is zero at the center and constant along the level curves of @xmath54 .",

    "@xmath43 the identity matrix , this is the ordinary euclidean distance to the origin .",

    "changing to hyperspherical coordinates by the map @xmath68^{n-2 } \\times [ 0,2\\pi ) \\longrightarrow \\rr^n\\ ] ] defined by @xmath69 yields a random vector @xmath70 with probability density function @xmath71 that respects the foliation by hyperellipsoids .",
    "note that @xmath72 meaning that the distance @xmath58 in @xmath26-space is the radius @xmath14 in @xmath73-space .",
    "integrating over the angular random variables , one is left with the marginal radial random variable @xmath8 with marginal probability density function @xmath74 where we used that the surface area of the unit sphere of dimension @xmath75 is @xmath76 , with @xmath77 the gamma function .",

    "we recover the hail storm setting . to evaluate insurance claims",
    "it is helpful to compare , at the point @xmath26 , the reported total damage to the expected total damage .",
    "since the latter quality is , by definition , constant along the level curve through @xmath26 , it is tempting to reduce the dimension of the problem by considering the marginal distribution in the radial direction , which has density function @xmath82 corresponding to the @xmath0-distribution with two degrees of freedom , also known as the rayleigh distribution .",
    "the total damage within the ellipse defined by @xmath83 takes on the particularly simple form @xmath84    since the @xmath0-distribution is the marginal distribution in the radial direction of a bivariate distribution with mode at its center , it does not suffer from the theoretical objection to the log - normal distribution raised in section [ sec : lognormal ] . as we shall see in the example data in the next section , even though the log - normal distribution depends on an additional parameter",
