    "in this paper we report on computations in which relativistic hydrodynamics has been employed to describe propagation of a wave pattern in accreted fluid .",
    "an axisymmetric perturbation is imposed on a background model of a transonic , advection - dominated flow .",
    "the fluid has negligible self - gravity ; it moves in spacetime of a kerr black hole that is described by parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .. hence , dimensionless angular momentum acquires values @xmath2 .",
    "corresponding quantities in physical units can be obtained by straightforward conversions ( misner et al .",
    "1993 , p.  36 ) . gravitational radius , @xmath3 , will be adopted as a convenient unit of length . ]",
    "while our approach is essentially one - dimensional , it is able to treat non - linear regime of the growing perturbation .",
    "the model can provide some insight into phenomena expected to occur in astrophysically realistic models .",
    "we build our computations on the results from several earlier papers .",
    "particularly relevant have been computations of manmoto et al.(1996 ; cited as p1 hereafter ) who explored wave propagation and reflection in a transonic flow ( see also kato et al.1998 , chapt .",
    "these authors found clear evidence for reflecting waves near the horizon .",
    "the perturbation then steepens into a shock wave .",
    "observational motivation for these studies comes from the evidence for x - ray fluctuations , origin of which is often linked with disturbances in the innermost regions of accretion flows . in p1 , the background accretion flow was constructed in the pseudo - newtonian framework , while we employ general relativistic description and relax several other restrictions .",
    "the main aim of this note is to show the results of our computations , where black hole rotation stands as one of the parameters .",
    "we refer to other , more extended papers for a thorough discussion of various connections and the place that these computations may have in a general scheme of the black - hole accretion . for instance",
    ", a lot of interest has been focused on the possibility of limit - cycle oscillations in accretion disks ( honma et al .",
    "1991 ) . indeed , non - linear time - dependent calculations of vertically integrated transonic accretion disks exhibit limit - cycle behaviour associated with thermal instability ( szuszkiewicz & miller 1998 ) .",
    "recently , bate et al .  ( 2002 ) analyzed axisymmetric waves with a two - dimensional hydrodynamical scheme .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : background ] the background stationary flow is constructed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : perturbed ] a perturbation is imposed on the background flow and its time evolution is examined .",
    "finally , the properties of the temporal behaviour are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "we assume kerr black - hole spacetime ; misner et al .  1973 ) with usual notation ; @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ; @xmath10 is determinant of the metric .",
    "horizon is at @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the flow mid - plane . ]",
    "in which hydrodynamic equations are solved . for the background flow ,",
    "we adopt a model described by gammie & popham ( 1998 ) and popham & gammie ( 1998 ) .",
    "steady - state equations are summarized in subsection [ sec : background ] for convenience , while our main attention will be focused on time evolution of a perturbation discussed later on in the text .",
    "the steady - state equations can be derived from :                in analogy with ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1997 ) , we defined the aspect ratio of the flow , @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is geometrical semi - thickness ) ; @xmath15 denotes the projection tensor , @xmath16 is the axial killing vector , and @xmath17 is the equilibrium shear stress tensor .",
    "four equations correspond to conservation laws ( i)(iv ) : @xmath18 the unknowns are : mid - plane density and temperature , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and two components of the fluid four - velocity @xmath21 .",
    ", the latter is conveniently expressed as the radial speed @xmath22 of the fluid local rest frame ( lrf ) with respect to the local frame co - rotating with the fluid at constant radius ( crf ) . in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , @xmath23 is the lorentz factor corresponding to azimuthal boost between crf and the locally non - rotating frame ( lnrf ) and similarly @xmath24 . ] in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , we denoted @xmath25 , @xmath26 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , @xmath27 is the eigenvalue of the problem and @xmath28 is the viscous tensor component .",
    "see gammie & popham ( 1998 ) and the appendix for details of the derivation .",
    "equations ( [ eq1])([eq4 ] ) were solved numerically and the obtained results agree with gammie & popham ( 1998 ) .",
    "the steady solution will be used as the initial state of the time - dependent flow integration in the next subsection .",
    "( 78mm,78mm)cont.eps      equations describing evolution of the flow are equivalent to those listed in items ( i)(iv ) in the previous subsection , except that we do not neglect terms containing time derivatives .",
    "the initial imposed perturbation is adopted analogical as in ref .",
    "p1 ( sec .  2 ) , so that comparisons are easier .",
    "namely , for the density perturbation we assume @xmath29 $ ] , where @xmath30 is the starting perturbation amplitude , @xmath31 is its location and @xmath32 is the characteristic length .",
    "notice that density perturbation can be related to perturbations of other quantities  @xmath20 , @xmath33 , and @xmath22 ( kato et al .",
    "an explicit form of the equations is given in the appendix .",
    "we solved the set ( [ eq5])([eq8 ] ) using the lax - wendroff scheme ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) with the free ingoing boundary condition imposed close above @xmath34 ( below the sound point ) .",
    "far from the black hole , the asymptotic form of the flow goes over to the stationary solution , eqs .",
    "( [ eq1])([eq4 ] ) .",
    "first , we reproduce ( in the general relativistic framework ) the basic behaviour of the flow perturbation .",
    "namely , we can observe the initial propagation of the wave towards horizon , its reflection in the region of several @xmath35 ( near the sonic point ) and then formation of a shock .",
    "( 76mm,76mm)cont0l.eps ( 76mm,76mm)cont9l.eps    in figure  [ fig1 ] , perturbation @xmath36 of the surface density @xmath37 is plotted .",
    "we set @xmath38 and @xmath39 for definiteness .",
    "the integration domain was @xmath40 ( somewhat smaller extent is captured in the graph ; @xmath41 corresponds to @xmath42s for @xmath38 ) .",
    "this figure can be compared with fig .  1 in p1 ( after a trivial scaling of units ) .",
    "our integration time is longer , allowing us to observe subsequent outgoing waves appearing at @xmath43 ( @xmath44 viscous periods at the outer edge of the integration grid ) . for definiteness we adopted @xmath45 here .",
    "in figure  [ fig2 ] , @xmath36 is shown for two limiting values of angular momentum , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "contour - lines show a crest of the initial perturbation which proceeds with the accretion flow . at small radii ,",
    "pattern speed is somewhat influenced by black hole angular momentum .",
    "several reflected waves appear at later stages until the simulation settles back to the initial state .",
    "given the initial perturbation and keeping @xmath47 and @xmath48 fixed , the form and the amplitude of waves are slightly sensitive to the black hole angular momentum  the effect that is difficult to treat within the pseudo - newtonian approach .",
    "however , the general scheme is in good agreement with the pseudo - newtonian treatment of paper p1 .",
    "we examined temporal behaviour of a simple relativistic model of the advection - dominated flow .",
    "to this aim , we observed the evolution of disturbances originating in outer parts of the disk .",
    "reflection of the waves was discussed previously in various contexts .",
    "we developed a robust code which is able to deal with the problem across the large range of disk parameters without introducing numerical viscosity .",
    "the scheme appears useful as a test bed for more complicated investigations with unstable behaviour , treated in more dimensions ( work in progress ) .    in this note",
    "we described a stable system which after a transition period eventually relaxes to the initial steady state .",
    "our scheme , thanks to its rather general formulation , exhibits more complex behaviour of reflected waves than the pseudo - newtonian model described in p1 .",
    "the main advantages are general relativistic treatment of hydrodynamic equations including finite propagation speed of viscous effects .",
    "we are also able to follow the evolution for longer intervals , till the shock escapes from the observed region and the model settles back to its initial equilibrium state .",

    "support from the grants gacr 205/00/1685 and 202/02/0735 is also acknowledged .",
    "the only non - vanishing component of the viscous tensor ( in lrf ) , @xmath49 , satisfies equation @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the fluid relaxation time .",
    "an equilibrium value @xmath52 is given in terms of @xmath47 parameter , speed of sound @xmath53 , enthalpy @xmath54 , and the shear tensor component @xmath55 : @xmath56 , where @xmath57 .",
