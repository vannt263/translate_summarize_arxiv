    "the fundamental statistical physics describing systems which are so far out of equilibrium that the notion of a partition function is not valid is currently not well understood .",

    "the dynamics of cdw systems are less well understood , particularly the structural aspects .",

    "we are able to interpret our data using an equation of motion for the phase of the cdw order parameter which pertains at low temperatures and at large applied fields .    in the next section of this paper ,",
    "we review the elementary physics describing cdws in one - dimensional metals and discuss the structure of both stationary and sliding cdws . in the third section ,",

    "the position of the @xmath15 atom , @xmath16 , is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the amplitude of the distortion wave , and @xmath19 is the real space lattice constant of the undistorted lattice .",
    "the conduction - electron - density wave and the lattice - distortion wave have the same phase , @xmath14 . in the literature ,",
    "cdws are frequently characterized by a complex order parameter , @xmath20 .",
    "the amplitude , @xmath21 , is usually taken to be the energy gap , which is linearly proportional to the amplitude of the lattice - distortion wave . the lattice - distortion wave and the associated conduction - electron - density wave",
    "are collectively referred to as a _ charge - density - wave_.    the properties of cdw systems have been studied extensively during the past 15 years .",
    "a large fraction of this research has been devoted to studies of the nonlinear electronic transport exhibited by some cdw systems@xcite .",
    "this nonlinear transport originates in an incommensurate cdw s ability to slide rigidly through an ideal crystal lattice without friction@xcite .",
    "real materials always contain lattice defects or impurities .",
    "these localized defects have energetic preferences for the phase and tend to `` pin '' the cdw in small regions , hence the term `` defect pinning . ''",
    "two phenomena are associated with defect pinning .",
    "first , the system can take advantage of the pinning energy of the defects by elastically distorting the cdw .",
    "this elastic distortion can be described by allowing the phase , @xmath14 , to become a function of position .",
    "clearly , this position dependence destroys the long - range periodicity of the cdw state . the _ phase - phase _ correlation function , @xmath22 ,",
    "is frequently used to describe this loss of long range periodicity and is characterized by the length scale @xmath23 .",
    "a large fraction of the theory of and experiments performed on cdw systems have been devoted to studying this loss of long - range order .",
    "second , and of particular relevance to this experiment , arbitrarily small fields are no longer capable of causing the cdw to slide . the cdw remains pinned until the applied field exceeds a threshold value , e@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the onset of sliding is signaled by the presence of a non - ohmic contribution to the conductivity when the current exceeds the threshold current , i@xmath24 .      in any experimental realization ,",
    "electrical contacts are required to produce the electric field which drives the cdw into the sliding state .",
    "the boundary conditions imposed by these electrical contacts play a crucial role in determining the structure of the sliding cdw state . to achieve a steady - state collective current due to the cdw sliding",
    ", current must be injected at one electrode and extracted at the other .",
    "equivalently , cdw phase fronts must be added at one electrode and removed at the other . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] , the dashed lines indicate lines of constant phase of the cdw . in the region of the sample between the contacts , the cdw phase fronts are moving when the cdw is sliding . in the regions of the sample which are outside the electrical contacts , there is no collective current and the cdw phase fronts are stationary .",
    "this intuitive picture suggests a simple model for the current conversion process originally proposed by j.c .",
    "gill to explain the transients observed in his pulsed electronic transport measurements@xcite .",
    "consider the contact on the top of fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] . before the electric field is applied , the cdw is uniform . as the electric field",
    "is applied , phase fronts in between the electrodes try to move down , dilating the cdw near the electrode on the top .",
    "this strain can be relieved by nucleating a dislocation loop , which quickly grows to be the size of the sample , inserting a new phase front as it does so .",
    "this mechanism of nucleating new lines of phase is called _ phase - slip_@xcite .",
    "in electronic transport experiments , the phase - slip mechanism is studied @xcite in a `` transposed '' configuration . in the `` normal '' four - probe configuration , current",
    "is injected at the ends of the sample and the voltage is measured at contacts which are separated by a distance _ l_. measurements @xcite find that , for a given @xmath25 , there is a difference between the voltage measured in the normal and transposed configurations .",
    "this difference is characterized by the phase - slip voltage , @xmath26 .",
    "a one - dimensional theory of the steady state current conversion process has been developed by ramakrishna _",
    "et al_.@xcite . in this theory ,",
    "the dislocation loops are thermally nucleated in the presence of a background strain field . as in any nucleation and growth problem ,",
    "loops above a critical size grow and those below the critical size collapse @xcite .",
    "the resulting equations of motion for @xmath27 are linearized and solved for the time - independent component , @xmath28 .",

    "et al_.@xcite have observed a position , temperature and electric field dependent strain of the sliding @xmath8 cdw in nbse@xmath7 consistent with the specific predictions of this model .",
    "the goal of the present experiments is to measure the time dependence of this strain field as the sign of the electric field is reversed .",
    "x - ray scattering is a nearly ideal probe of the periodic structure of a cdw . in this section , we will review the standard theory relating the observed x - ray scattering to the microscopic structure of the cdw .",
    "then , we will discuss some extensions necessary to describe time - dependent systems .      in the kinematic approximation ,",
    "the scattered intensity measured in an x - ray scattering experiment is directly proportional to the spatial fourier transform of the _ equal - time _",

    "the subscript @xmath37 identifies the time - dependent probability distribution to be used when taking this average .    at low temperatures ,",
    "the electronic charge density of an ideal , monatomic crystal can be approximated by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the electronic charge density of an isolated atom and @xmath40 is the set of equilibrium lattice sites .",
    "the sinusoidal lattice distortion associated with the cdw state can be introduced by letting @xmath41    we then proceed to calculate the @xmath42 structure factor , @xmath43 , arriving at the expression@xcite    @xmath44 }   \\right >   + \\cdots \\right \\ } \\label{eq : sofq.cdw}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath45 is the atomic form factor and @xmath46 is the n@xmath47 order bessel function and the notation specifying @xmath37 has been suppressed .",
    "the first sum inside the square brackets produces the bragg peaks associated with the undistorted crystal lattice .",
    "the second sum creates satellite peaks separated by @xmath48 from each bragg peak .",
    "since this is still a @xmath42 model , the angular brackets in this term indicate an average over different realizations of the quenched defect distribution .",
    "the line shape of the cdw satellite peaks is given by the spatial fourier transform of the _ equal - time - phase - phase _ correlation function .",
    "in these measurements , @xmath49 so we can use small argument expansions for the bessel functions to simplify eqn .",

    "note that the x - ray measurements are dominated by the localized atomic core electrons .",
    "these x - ray scattering experiments on cdw systems probe the structure of the lattice - distortion - wave component of the cdw state .",
    "the conduction - electron - density wave plays only an incidental role in determining the form of the observed scattering .      in principle",
    ", one would like to analyze the data using an expression containing the full @xmath43 .",
    "note that , as defined in eqn .",
    "[ eq : sofq.gen ] , the time dependence of @xmath43 originates in the time - dependence of the probability distribution @xmath37 .",
    "thus , in a time - dependent measurement , one is studying the evolution of @xmath37 .",
    "frequently , the fokker - planck equation is used for such studies .",
    "such an analysis is not out of the question for this system .",
    "for example , the elegant formalism developed to study the kinetics of first order phase transitions @xcite might be applied to this problem .",
    "however , the signal to noise ratio of our data is not yet sufficiently high to warrant such an analysis . instead , as in the experiments of dicarlo _",
    "et al_.@xcite , we will only seek to understand the physics describing the evolution of the strain of the cdw as a function of time and position on the sample .",
    "in essence , we will be studying the evolution of the first moment of the probability distribution , not the full distribution function .",
    "as in the steady state case,@xcite we begin with a one - dimensional langevin equation of motion for @xmath52    @xmath53    here @xmath54 is a damping constant , @xmath55 is the quenched random pinning force and @xmath56 is the langevin noise field .    to study the kinetic problem",
    ", we now follow a similar line of reasoning to that used by ramakrishna _",
    "et al._@xcite for the steady - state case .",
    "we begin by defining @xmath57 .",
    "where , @xmath58 represents the bulk solution to the sliding cdw problem and @xmath32 is a small time - independent correction which describes the background strain field required to drive dislocation loop nucleation at the current contacts . for the transient problem , instead of requiring @xmath32 to be constant in time , we allow @xmath32 to have a _ slow _ time dependence .",
    "by `` slow '' we mean that @xmath58 fluctuates so rapidly relative to @xmath32 that @xmath58 is always in equilibrium with the current value of @xmath32 .",
    "we show below that the characteristic time scale for changes in @xmath32 is on the order of milliseconds , much slower than any electronic time scales in this system .",
    "we then continue to use the same logic as ramakrishna _",
    "et al_.@xcite , to develop an equation of motion for @xmath59 . in the limit where the driving electric field is far enough above threshold that the pinning force and the noise term are both negligible",
    ", this equation of motion becomes a simple driven diffusion equation ,    @xmath60    we are interested in the solution to eq .",
    "[ eq : de ] for the simple case where the sign of the driving field , @xmath61 , is reversed at @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "laplace transform techniques produce a series solution which converges rapidly at early times .",
    "conversely , the separation of variables technique produces a series solution which converges rapidly at late times .",
    "the details of the latter series solution are given in the appendix . using the appropriate solution at a given time , @xmath64",
    ", we have a convenient representation of the solution for all times @xmath65 .",
    "we chose to use nbse@xmath7 for our experiments for a number of reasons .",
    "first , although a large number materials are known to exhibit cdw states , the cdws in nbse@xmath7 both exhibit sliding mode conduction and have been extensively studied in electronic transport measurements .",
    "second , we are able to grow crystallographically perfect , single crystal whiskers of nbse@xmath7 .",
    "these structural defect - free samples are essential if one wishes to measure these small strains@xcite .",
    "third , in nbse@xmath7 the fermi surface is not completely gapped below the first peierls transition .",
    "the system remains metallic and the electronic transport is still dominated by the normal carriers .",
    "consequently , the electric field must remain uniform inside the whisker , eliminating spurious polarization effects due to poor electrical contacts in regions not too close to the electrodes . finally , the technology required to produce good electrical contacts has been well developed for nbse@xmath7",
    ".    on a microscopic level , the crystal structure of nbse@xmath7 is monoclinic , with lattice constants @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69@xcite .",
    "macroscopically , these crystals grow as long whiskers with a rectangular cross section .",
    "the width of a whisker is typically ten times the thickness .",
    "typical dimensions of a sample used in our experiments are on the order of 2 @xmath70 m @xmath71 20 @xmath70 m @xmath71 10 mm .",
    "both the crystallographic * b * and * b*@xmath72 directions are oriented along the whisker axis .",
    "the smallest macroscopic sample dimension usually corresponds to the * a*@xmath72 direction .",
    "two independent cdws form in nbse@xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath8 cdw forms at a temperature of @xmath73 = 145 k and has the wave vector @xmath74 where @xmath75 is is slightly temperature dependent and approximately equal to 0.243 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath76 cdw forms at roughly @xmath77 = 59 k and has the wave vector @xmath78 where @xmath79 is approximately equal to 0.263 .",
    "all of the measurements reported in this paper were performed at temperatures above @xmath77 and below @xmath73 .",
    "the x - ray scattering measurements were performed at the f2 experimental station at the cornell high energy synchrotron source ( chess ) .",
    "the storage ring was running at an energy of 5 gev and the stored positron current typically decayed from 80 to 40 ma during a 50 minute fill cycle .",
    "for the purposes of comparing different data sets , we have normalized the data to counts per second at 100 ma ring current . a si(111 ) double - bounce monochromator selected a wavelength of 1.5  from the white x - ray beam produced by the 24-pole wiggler . a flat au - coated mirror in the hutch suppressed harmonics of the fundamental wavelength passed by the monochromator .",
    "the sagittally - bent second monochromator crystal focused the x - ray beam in the out - of - scattering - plane direction at the sample position .",
    "tantalum slits restricted the x - ray spot size at the sample to approximately 0.8 mm @xmath71 3 mm .",
    "the resulting x - ray beam contained @xmath80 x - rays / second/100 ma of stored positron current .",
    "the scattered x - rays were analyzed by a triple - bounce channel cut si(111 ) crystal and detected by a standard nai(tl ) scintillator and photomultiplier tube .",
    "the nbse@xmath7 whiskers were mounted across a 4 mm hole in an alumina substrate using silver paint , which also provided the electrical contacts .",
    "the distance between the electrical contacts was @xmath81 mm . in these measurements",
    "the sample was oriented such that the length of the sample in the beam was 0.8 mm , centered at roughly the @xmath82 position between the contacts .",
    "to study the transient structural response of the cdw , we made a stroboscopic measurement@xcite .",
    "the cdw is subjected to a continuous square wave voltage wave form .",
    "the half period of the square wave is divided into time intervals of equal size .",
    "x - rays detected during a particular time interval are summed over a large number of square wave periods .",
    "typical count rates at the cdw satellite were on the order of 50 counts / second @ 100 ma of ring current .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain reasonable counting statistics in a 4 msec wide time bin , we sum over roughly 10,000 voltage wave form cycles .",
    "transient structural effects due to ohmic heating of the sample were eliminated by switching only the direction of a constant magnitude current , thus keeping the ohmic heating constant .",
    "time - resolved measurements of the @xmath83 bragg peak as the current direction is switched do not exhibit any measurable change , ruling out transients due to changes in the lattice ( _ e.g. _ , a strain of the lattice due to a bend of the whisker driven by the electric field ) .",
    "all the data presented in this paper were taken on the @xmath84 cdw satellite .",
    "the @xmath85 cdw satellites are particularly attractive for high resolution work because they are nearly non - dispersive for si(111 ) monochromator / analyzer optics and because the @xmath86 structure factor is zero in nbse@xmath7 , eliminating any diffuse background from the @xmath87 tail of the bragg peak .",
    "the measured @xmath35-space resolution ( fwhm ) of our diffractometer in this region of reciprocal space was @xmath88@xmath89 , @xmath90@xmath89 , and @xmath91@xmath89 .",
    "all of the data shown in the figures were taken at 70 k. using the standard technique , the depinning current was measured by using a lock - in amplifier to measure the differential resistance as a function of current . at 90 k , @xmath92 ma .",
    "based on this measurement , we estimate @xcite that at 70 k , @xmath93 ma .",
    "figure [ fig:2d ] illustrates a typical data set : the observed intensity , @xmath94 , is plotted as a two - dimensional surface .",
    "the same data set is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] as a contour plot .",
    "the evolution of the cdw satellite as the system is driven by the voltage wave form shown in the inset is clearly visible in either figure .",
    "the solid lines in fig . [",
    "fig : contour ] are contours of constant scattered intensity .",
    "the contours are separated by 30 counts / second @ 100 ma .",
    "the magnitude of the driving current wave form in this case was 21 ma , slightly greater than the threshold current , @xmath95 20 ma .",
    "after the current direction is switched , a slow shift in the position of the cdw satellite is visible with a time scale on the order of a few milliseconds .",
    "the period of the driving wave form is chosen so that the cdw satellite peak stabilizes at its steady - state position before the next switch in the direction of the current .    close inspection of figs .",
    "[ fig:2d ] or [ fig : contour ] reveals that the satellite peak does not have the same shape or width for the different current directions .",
    "the data exhibits several other asymmetric features .",
    "in particular , the position and width of the line shape of the zero - field cooled state differ from those of the pinned state which a sliding cdw relaxes into after the driving field is removed .",
    "the details of these asymmetries are also position dependent .",
    "the asymmetry of the line shape of the driven sliding state is more clearly seen at lower driving fields .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : bimodal ] shows a series of longitudinal scans through the cdw satellite from different time intervals as the current direction is switched .",
    "these data were taken at 70 k and with a driving current of 17 ma .",
    "each scan is offset by 35 cps @ 100 ma for clarity .",
    "the top and bottom scans represent the steady - state for the two current directions .",
    "the remaining scans show that the cdw satellite peak evolves from a single peak to a bimodal line shape .",
    "data sets taken with higher driving current magnitudes exhibited the same systematic structure .",
    "in general , as the driving current magnitude was increased , the area under the stationary peak decreased . at 29 ma ,",
    "the stationary peak is no longer measurable .",
    "the width of the moving peak is slightly broader in the transient regions .    to characterize the data",
    ", we fit to a two component line shape .",
    "one peak was constrained to have a time - invariant position , width , and integrated intensity .",
    "the integrated intensity of the second peak was also held constant , but the position and width were allowed to vary with time .",
    "empirically , each of the peaks is well described by a pseudo - voigt line shape @xcite .",
    "the solid lines shown in fig . [ fig : bimodal ] represent fits to the sum of two pseudo - voigt functions .",
    "the values of @xmath96 for the fits were between 1 and 4 where we have assumed that the errors are due to counting statistics .",
    "figure [ fig : ratio ] displays the fraction of the total integrated intensity under the stationary peak as a function of the magnitude of the driving current .",
    "the fraction of the sample which remains pinned decreases monotonically as the current is raised . at a current magnitude of 29 ma ,",
    "this fraction drops to zero . due to systematic changes in the scattering geometry as the diffractometer",
    "was raised and lowered in order to vary @xmath31 , we can not directly compare the intensities observed in different sets .",
    "figure [ fig : separation ] shows the difference in position of the sliding and pinned peaks as a function of time for one complete period of the driving current wave form .",
    "the particular data set shown was taken at a current of 29 ma but is representative of the data taken at all currents .",
    "error bars represent standard fitting errors @xcite .",
    "a simple interpretation of this data is that at driving fields near the threshold to sliding the cdw breaks into domains .",
    "although a collective current is flowing , some portions of the sample remain unstrained and hence are presumed to be pinned .",
    "one possible explanation of the physics is that near an impurity site , the applied electric field may be insufficient to cause the cdw to slide . the same singularity at @xmath97 in the dielectric function , @xmath98 , which drives the cdw phase transition also causes the system to respond to a point impurity by creating a localized electronic state with wavenumber @xmath99.@xcite indeed , this second effect is the origin of impurity pinning .",
    "however , the pinned portions of the sample should not exhibit the time - dependent strain of the sliding portions .",
    "if the domains are small enough , the cdw satellite peak should broaden and we do observe significant broadening of the cdw satellite peak in * a@xmath100 * direction near threshold .",
    "since the peak moves in the * b@xmath100 * direction , it was not possible to characterize this broadening quantitatively .",
    "the peak width in the * b@xmath100 * direction is roughly 25% greater in the sliding state than in the zero field cooled state .",
    "the observation that raising the current reduces the area under the stationary peak provides further support for this picture since at large enough fields ( currents ) , the whole sample should be in the sliding state . in this scenario , the depinning current measured using the lock - in amplifier can not be interpreted simply as the single current at which the cdw is depinned over the entire crystal",
    ".    quantitative analysis of these time - dependent strain results is somewhat problematic .",
    "specifically , eqn . [ eq : de ] applies only at driving fields well above threshold .",
    "the highest current at which we were able to obtain data was on the order of @xmath101 .",
    "the model specifically predicts that the time constants for different directions should be the same ; yet , the data are clearly asymmetric .",
    "furthermore , there are not enough time bins in the transition region to make a reliable test of eqn .",
    "[ eq : de ] and hence the model .    on the other hand ,",
    "these data are sufficient to demonstrate that x - ray measurements produce results which are consistent with electronic transport measurements . to characterize quantitatively the time scales of the observed transients , we fit the relative peak positions to    @xmath102    where @xmath103 .",

    "[ fig : separation ] is the best fit to eq .",
    "[ eq : fit ] .",
    "the amplitude , @xmath104 , and the nominal zero field value , @xmath105 , were forced to be consistent for the current switch in both directions but the time constant @xmath106 was allowed to differ .",

    "similarly , the magnitude of the strain is much smaller .",
    "we do not have an explanation for this behavior but observe that this jump occurs at roughly the depinning current .",
    "it is possible that at currents below the depinning current , the cdw is `` sloshing '' back and forth slightly as hypothesized by feinberg and freidel @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have developed a time - resolved high - resolution x - ray scattering system capable of measuring the transient structural response of a simple quasi - one - dimensional cdw system as it is driven between two distinct steady state configurations .",
    "we find that a simple langevin equation of motion for the phase of the cdw , which is based on the notion of a background strain which is driving the nucleation of dislocation loops , gives a value of the phenomenological damping constant , @xmath54 , for the @xmath8 cdw in nbse@xmath7 of @xmath110 ev @xmath4 seconds @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "this value of @xmath54 is in excellent agreement with the value obtained from electronic transport experiments .",
    "as the driving field approaches threshold from above , the line shape becomes bimodal and the area under the stationary component of the line shape increases monotonically .",
