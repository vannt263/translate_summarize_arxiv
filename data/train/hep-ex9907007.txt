    "chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath2pt ) is a very powerful tool to describe various @xmath3 decays in which long distance contributions are expected to dominate . for example , the decay mode @xmath4 has been observed recently , and compared with @xmath2pt  @xcite .",
    "the measured branching ratio and @xmath5 momentum spectrum are found to be consistent with the predictions , after fitting one free parameter contained in the theory .",
    "the neutral counterpart , @xmath6 , is another decay mode , where detailed studies have been performed . in this case ,",
    "the lowest order @xmath7 calculation  @xcite does not reproduce the measured branching ratio  @xcite . extending the calculation to the next - to - leading order @xmath8  @xcite , and adding a vector meson contribution  @xcite",
    ", the prediction is now in good agreement with the branching ratio as well as distinct @xmath9 spectrum .",
    "we note that an effective coupling constant ( @xmath10 ) , a free parameter in the vector meson contribution , has been determined by the measurements with experimental errors  @xcite .",
    "the as yet unobserved decay mode @xmath11 can provide another testing ground for @xmath2pt . since theoretical ingredients are same for both @xmath6 and @xmath11 modes , a straightforward extension from @xmath6 provides definite prediction for a branching ratio and @xmath12 spectrum  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the branching ratio is calculated to be @xmath13 .",
    "thus experimental study of this mode is important to test the theoretical framework of @xmath2pt .    other interests in this decay mode stem from its close relationship to the mode @xmath14 , which has been of much attention as a possible channel to observe direct @xmath15-violation .",
    "first , @xmath11 is expected to have a much larger branching ratio than @xmath14 , and hence can be an experimental background in a soft photon region .",
    "second , there also exists a @xmath15-conserving amplitude in @xmath14 via two - photon intermediate states ; this can be in principle determined from a detail analysis of @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "further understanding of the @xmath6 amplitude , which can be checked by the @xmath11 mode , is thus essential .    in this article ,",
    "we report on an experimental search for the decay mode @xmath11 conducted with a proton synchrotron at high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) .",
    "the data for the @xmath11 mode were recorded simultaneously with the experiment which has established a new decay mode @xmath16  @xcite . since the experimental set - up was described already in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is briefly mentioned here for convenience .",
    "the @xmath17 beam was produced by focusing 12-gev / c primary protons onto a 60-mm - long copper target .",
    "its divergence was @xmath184  mrad horizontally and @xmath1820  mrad vertically after a series of collimators embedded in magnets .",
    "the set - up started with a 4-m - long decay volume .",
    "it was followed by a charged particle spectrometer consisting of four sets of drift chambers and an analyzing magnet with an average horizontal momentum kick of 136  mev / c .",
    "a threshold cherenkov counter ( gc ) with pure n@xmath19 gas at 1 atm was placed inside of the magnet gap to identify electrons .",
    "for the present decay mode , we obtained an average electron efficiency of 94% with a pion - rejection factor of 350 by adjusting software cuts in the off - line analysis . a pure csi electromagnetic calorimeter played a crucial role in this analysis .",
    "it was located at the downstream end of the spectrometer , and consisted of 540 crystal blocks , each being 70  mm by 70  mm in cross section and 300  mm ( @xmath20 16x@xmath21 ) in length .",
    "it was configured into two banks of 15 ( horizontal ) @xmath22 18 ( vertical ) matrix .",
    "its energy and position resolutions were found to be approximately 3% and 7  mm for 1-gev electrons , respectively .",
    "the trigger for the present mode was designed to select events with @xmath23  2 electron - like tracks and @xmath23  3 cluster candidates in the calorimeter .",
    "it was formed with information from gc and csi together with trigger scintillator hodoscopes interspersed between the chambers and calorimeter .",
    "in reconstructing @xmath11 events , major backgrounds are expected come from both @xmath24 and @xmath25 modes , where @xmath26 denotes the dalitz decay @xmath27 . among them",
    ", @xmath24 is an intrinsic background and can not be removed .",
    "it is instead used as a normalization mode by positively identifying the dalitz decay .",
    "the @xmath25 mode may become background when two ( or more ) photons fuse into one in the calorimeter , and/or its vertex is reconstructed incorrectly to give false invariant masses .",
    "care was taken in this analysis to enhance position resolution of decay vertex and purity of photon clusters .",
    "this effort was found useful also to reject backgrounds originating from external conversions and hadron ( mostly neutron ) interactions .    in the actual off - line analysis",
    ", we first selected events containing two tracks with a common vertex in the beam region inside the decay volume .",
    "we then requested events to have @xmath23  5 clusters in the calorimeter . here",
    "the cluster was defined as @xmath28 csi blocks around the local maximum with the total energy deposit greater than 200  mev ( @xmath18 3.5  nsec timing window ) .",
    "particle species were then determined . a charged track which could project onto a csi cluster",
    "was called a matched track .",
    "an electron ( or positron ) was identified as a matched track with 0.9 @xmath29 e / p @xmath29 1.1 , where e was an energy measured by the calorimeter and p was a momentum determined by the spectrometer , respectively .",
    "also gc hits in the corresponding cells were requested .",
    "clusters which did not match with any charged tracks were treated as photon candidates .",
    "event topology was then checked .",
    "we requested events to contain exactly one @xmath30-pair and three photon candidates , consistent with the @xmath11 topology .",
    "no additional activities , such as an extra track , gc hit , or cluster with an energy above @xmath2060  mev , was allowed in the detector track segment upstream of the magnet could be projected onto a neutral cluster with an energy below 400  mev , we simply ignored this activity . ] .",
    "the probability of over - veto was estimated using @xmath24 and @xmath31 reconstructed events , and was found to be about 12% ( common to both @xmath11 and @xmath24 modes ) .",
    "two quality cuts were imposed at this stage .",
    "one was a cluster shape cut ; it examined mainly a cluster s transverse energy profile , and checked whether or not it was consistent with a single photon .",
    "we used a large sample of @xmath32 reconstructed events to characterize actual photon showers , and found the cut efficiency to be 95% per a single photon cluster .",
    "the other quality cut was imposed on an @xmath33-track opening angle ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "larger opening angle resulted generally in better vertex position resolution , which in turn led to better invariant mass resolution and background rejection .",
    "we employed a monte carlo simulation to study background rejection power , especially for the @xmath25 mode , and determined to demand @xmath35  20  mrad .",
    "as a final step in the general event selection , we imposed two loose kinematical cuts to reduce sample size . they were @xmath36  400  mev / c@xmath37 and @xmath38  100  mrad@xmath39 , where @xmath40 represents the angle of the reconstructed @xmath41 momentum with respect to the line connecting the target and vertex .",
    "having selected candidate events , we scrutinized each event from the viewpoint of kinematical variables .",
    "first of all , we calculated @xmath42 invariant mass for three possible combinations .",
    "the solid - line histogram shown in fig.[fig : gamma - gamma ] is the distribution for all combinations while the shaded one for the combination closest to @xmath43 .",
    "we retained all combinations which satisfied @xmath44  2.5@xmath45 background events , estimated by a monte carlo simulation , became less than one inside the final signal box ( see below ) .",
    "] , where @xmath45 being the observed mass resolution of 5.1  mev / c@xmath37 .",
    "we then calculated the angle ( @xmath46 ) between reconstructed @xmath47 and @xmath48 momentum vectors in the @xmath17 rest frame with an observed @xmath49 energy . ] .",
    "events originating from @xmath11 or @xmath24 should satisfy @xmath50 in this frame .",
    "the dots with error bars in fig.[fig : cos - star ] show the @xmath51 distribution ; a clear peak of events at @xmath50 can be seen .",
    "the histogram in fig.[fig : cos - star ] is monte carlo data for the @xmath25 mode , in which the flux was normalized by the observed @xmath24 events ( see below ) . to select signals",
    ", we requested events to satisfy a collinearity cut , @xmath52 , as shown by the arrow in fig.[fig : cos - star ] .",
    "we now identify @xmath24 events . if more than one @xmath42 combination within an event satisfied the @xmath53 cut , we selected the one for which the quantity , @xmath54 became minimum . here",
    "@xmath55 is the observed @xmath47 mass resolution for the dalitz decay mode ( see below for the actual value ) .",
    "fig.[fig : p0p0d](a ) shows a scatter plot of @xmath56 vs @xmath57 after selecting the @xmath42 combination with @xmath58 . to select @xmath24 events further",
    ", @xmath38  30  mrad@xmath39 was demanded .",
    "fig.[fig : p0p0d](b ) shows a scatter plot of @xmath56 vs @xmath59 after this cut .",
    "a clear cluster of @xmath24 events can be seen in the expected region of @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "fig.[fig : p0p0d](c ) is the projection onto the @xmath59 axis , and fig.[fig : p0p0d](d ) is onto the @xmath56 axis with a @xmath62 mass cut ( see below ) . from these projections , we found @xmath62 and @xmath17 mass resolutions to be @xmath63 4.5  mev / c@xmath37 and @xmath64 16  mev / c@xmath37 , respectively .",
    "our final signal box , shown by the rectangle in fig.[fig : p0p0d](b ) , was defined by @xmath653@xmath66 and @xmath67  3@xmath68 .",
    "after all the cuts , 49 events remained .",
    "we estimated the number of @xmath25 backgrounds in the signal region by a monte carlo simulation , and found to be less than one .",
    "we are now in a position to look for the @xmath11 mode .",
    "first we rejected @xmath24 events ; if an event satisfied both @xmath69  5@xmath45 and @xmath70  5@xmath66 for any @xmath71 combinations , then the event was discarded .",
    "note that we employed the looser kinematical cut of 5@xmath45(@xmath66 ) to exclude possible @xmath24 events .",
    "then we rejected @xmath25 backgrounds . in this case , an event containing @xmath62 whose transverse momentum was consistent with @xmath25 ( p@xmath72  139  mev / c ) was excluded .",
    "the remaining events are shown in a scatter plot of @xmath56 vs @xmath57 in fig.[fig : p0p0p0d](a ) .",
    "we are left with no events inside our signal box defined by @xmath38  30  mrad@xmath37 and @xmath67  3@xmath73 was 11.6  mev / c@xmath37 .",
    "this was the value of the monte carlo mass resolution ( 8  mev / c@xmath37 ) for @xmath11 times the ratio of the observed ( @xmath74  mev / c@xmath37 ) to monte carlo ( 11  mev / c@xmath37 ) resolutions for @xmath24 . ] .",
    "the background events still remaining in the low mass region of @xmath75  460  mev / c@xmath37 were found to originate mostly from the @xmath25 mode .",
    "the projection of events with @xmath38  30  mrad@xmath37 onto the @xmath56 axis is shown in fig.[fig : p0p0p0d](b ) .",
    "the solid - line histogram is for the data , the shaded one for monte carlo events ( sum of @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) and the dotted one for @xmath11 monte carlo events . from the monte carlo simulation ,",
    "whose flux was normalized by the observed @xmath24 signals , we expected 1.1 backgrounds ( 0.45 from @xmath24 and 0.66 from @xmath25 ) to remain in the signal box .",
    "the branching ratio is calculated by @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 denote acceptance , efficiency and observed number of events , respectively .",
    "the detector acceptances depend on the matrix elements : we employed a theoretical model given by ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath11 and kroll - wada spectrum for the dalitz decay  @xcite . the actual acceptances ( including the hardware trigger conditions ) were determined by monte carlo simulations and were found to be @xmath80 for @xmath11 and @xmath81 for @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the detector efficiency was found to be practically same for both modes . however , some of the quality and kinematical cuts caused efficiency differences .    since the opening angle of @xmath30-tracks was different for the two modes , it caused efficiency difference in both the vertex reconstruction and the track opening angle cut .",
    "these efficiencies were found to be 70% ( vertex ) and 89% ( @xmath34 ) for @xmath11 mode while 62% and 81% for @xmath24 mode , respectively .",
    "next , the collinearity ( @xmath82 ) cut produced 25% inefficiency for the signal mode while negligibly small loss for the normalization mode .",
    "the @xmath62 mass cut was unique to @xmath24 ; its efficiency was found to be 96% ( 3@xmath83 cut ) . for the signal mode we rejected @xmath24 events ; it caused 9% inefficiency at the specific @xmath84 invariant mass region .",
    "we also rejected @xmath25 events with the @xmath85 inclusive veto ; it resulted in 7% inefficiency . combining other efficiencies together , we found the final acceptance and efficiency ratio @xmath86 to be 0.670 .    inserting the known branching ratios  @xcite into @xmath87 ,",
    "the single event sensitivity was obtained to be @xmath88 , where the error represents the statistical uncertainty .",
    "the upper limit on the branching ratio was determined to be @xmath89 in which the statistical error of the normalization mode was taken into account  @xcite .    in summary",
