    "<S> selection of state - insensitive or `` magic '' trapping conditions with ultracold atoms or molecules , where pairs of internal states experience identical trapping potentials , brings substantial benefits to precision measurements and quantum computing schemes . </S>",
    "<S> working at such conditions could ensure that detrimental effects of inevitable inhomogeneities across an ultracold sample are significantly reduced . </S>",
    "<S> however , this aspect of confinement remains unexplored for ultracold polar molecules . </S>",
    "<S> here , we present means to control the ac stark shift of rotational states of ultracold diatomic polar molecules , when subjected to both trapping laser light and an external electric field . we show that both the strength and relative orientation of the two fields influence the trapping potential . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we predict  magic electric field strengths \" and a  magic angle \" , where the stark shift is independent of the dc external field for certain rotational states of the molecule .    the advantage of using state - independent light traps for precision frequency measurements with ultracold atoms has been demonstrated in several experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> applications of this approach were analyzed in the context of optical atomic clocks and coherent control of atoms and photons within an optical cavity . </S>",
    "<S> for these applications the frequency of the laser beam that creates a far - off resonant optical dipole trap is chosen such that the ac stark shift of the ground and one excited electronic atomic level are the same . in this way any optical atomic transition between these levels is unaffected by the trapping light . in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite state - insensitive trapping conditions have also been found for microwave transitions in the atomic ground state by using a combination of the vector and tensor components of the ac stark shift and an external magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> ultracold molecular systems possess unique proporties that are considered to make them potentially useful as tools for precision measurements @xcite and quantum computing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is desirable to extend the zero - differential ac stark shift technique to these more complex systems . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of `` magic '' frequencies for vibrational raman transitions in homo - nuclear sr@xmath0 molecules was first explored in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this molecule is proposed for a search of possible time variation of the electron - to - proton mass ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the ac stark shift of a molecule is determined by the dynamic molecular polarizability @xmath1 , which is a function of radiation frequency @xmath2 and its polarization .    </S>",
    "<S> polar molecules have a permanent dipole moment and their levels can be shifted and mixed with one another by applying an external electric field . </S>",
    "<S> this opens up a new way to create `` magic '' trapping conditions for two rotational levels of the molecule . in the presence of an external electric field , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 is not a good quantum number and all states , even the `` rotationless '' ground state , have an anisotropic polarizability  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy of the dynamic polarizability of these levels manifests itself as a dependence on the relative orientation of the polarization of the trapping laser and the dc electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the combined action of these two fields can be a powerful tool to manipulate and control ultracold molecules trapped in an optical potential .    </S>",
    "<S> the behavior described here has potential applications to several experiments that have been envisioned for diatomic polar molecules held in optical traps . </S>",
    "<S> the implications are particularly striking for the use of polar molecules in an optical lattice as quantum bits . as was described in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , a pair of rotational states forms a suitable quantum bit . </S>",
    "<S> however , it was pointed out that this system is susceptible to decoherence due to intensity fluctuations in the optical trapping lasers , if the dynamic polarizabilities of these levels differ as is generally the case . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn leads to very stringent requirements on the laser intensity stability for such a system to be practical . as we will show </S>",
    "<S> , this limitation can be removed by adjusting the experimental parameters to guarantee that the dynamic polarizabilities of these states are equal . in particular , for this proposed system ( where a spatial gradient of the electric field @xmath4 is required , so working at a magic electric field value is impossible ) it should be possible to use light polarized at the `` magic angle '' relative to the static field in order to eliminate this potentially dangerous source of decoherence .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of magic electric field values is also of possible use for envisioned applications where polar molecules in optical lattices are employed in novel types of many - body systems . </S>",
    "<S> this includes , for example , cases where the properties of long - range molecular interactions are tailored by a combination of a static electric field and resonant microwave fields coupling different rotational states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> working at a magic electric field value in such systems could ensure that the inevitable inhomogeneities in the intensity of the trapping light across a large sample would not change the resonant condition for the microwave drive fields . </S>",
    "<S> hence , working under such `` magic '' conditions might be necessary to implement proposals of this type .    </S>",
    "<S> motivated by these ideas , we calculate the near - infrared dynamic polarizability of various rotational levels of the @xmath5 vibrational state of the x@xmath6 potential of the krb and rbcs molecules , under the simultaneous influence of trapping electromagnetic and static electric fields . we calculate dynamic polarizability using the computational techniques developed in previous publications @xcite . our calculations with an external electric field are predominantly performed at a laser frequency of 9174 @xmath7 ( or wavelength of 1090 nm ) , which corresponds to an often - used frequency to trap atoms and molecules in ultracold experiments . in the near infrared this laser frequency is sufficiently far away from molecular resonances of the excited electronic states that heating due to photon scattering is negligible . </S>",

    "<S> we begin by studying the dynamic polarizability or ac stark shift for the @xmath13 and @xmath14 rotational levels of the @xmath5 x@xmath6 state of krb and rbcs in the near infrared , without an external electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure used to determine the complex molecular polarizability has already been described in our previous paper @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ zero - field ] illustrates the results of this study in the absence of an electric field by showing the dynamic polarizability @xmath15 as a function of laser frequency @xmath16 . the range of laser frequencies spans a technologically relevant near - infrared optical domain and includes the lasing frequency near 9174 @xmath7 used in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the figure also shows that the dynamic polarizability of the molecular state depends on the rotational quantum number @xmath3 and its projection @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the curves for the different states do not cross as a function of the laser frequency . in other words , at zero electric field we can not find a `` magic '' frequency for j=0 and j=1 states using trapping light in the near infrared . + </S>",
    "<S> * field - dependent dynamic polarizability * + here we extend the idea of the ac stark shift for the rotational levels of the x@xmath6 ground state to the mixing of these levels in a static electric field @xmath17 along the space - fixed @xmath18 direction . </S>",
    "<S> our analyses show that the experimentally accessible electric fields mix only a few low - lying rotational states . </S>",
    "<S> the ultimate goal is to introduce the dynamic polarizability of the mixed rotational levels as a function of an external dc electric field and the polarization of the ac trapping field . in a heteronuclear molecule </S>",
    "<S> this stark mixing is primarily due to the permanent electronic dipole moment @xmath19 ; we neglect the much smaller effects due to stark mixing with other electronic states . for the hund s case ( a ) </S>",
    "<S> x@xmath6 state of an alkali - metal dimer , the total electron spin and orbital angular momentum are not coupled to the molecular rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the molecular wavefunction in the lab frame , @xmath20 , is then given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a vibrational quantum number , @xmath3 and @xmath8 are the molecular rotational angular momentum and its projection along the @xmath23 axis , @xmath24 is the radial rovibrational wavefunction , @xmath25 is a spherical harmonic , @xmath26 is the orientation of the molecule relative to the electric field direction @xmath23 , @xmath27 is the electronic wavefunction with projections defined along the internuclear axis . for the x@xmath6 state , in even modest electric fields </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear spins are well - decoupled from the other spins and angular momenta ; hence we ignore the nuclear spins here . </S>",
    "<S> then the hamiltonian for such a system becomes @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the vibrational energy and rotational constant of vibrational level @xmath22 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> higher order rotational corrections are negligible . for the alkali - metal dimers krb and rbcs we have </S>",
    "<S> that @xmath32 is on the order of 50 - 100 @xmath7 for small @xmath22 , while @xmath31 is on the order of 0.017 - 0.037 @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the matrix elements of the operator @xmath33 by noting that after averaging over the electronic wavefunction @xmath34 it reduces to @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the @xmath37-dependent permanent electric dipole moment , @xmath38 are tensors of rank @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the electric field strength . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , this operator conserves the projection quantum number @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix element between two rovibrational states is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the kronecker delta function , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are 3-@xmath45 symbols ( see e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this matrix element is nonzero when @xmath46 is even , according to the parity selection rules , and is independent of the sign of @xmath8 and @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> for the small @xmath3 values of interest here we can assume that the @xmath3 dependence of @xmath24 is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , coupling between vibrational levels can also be ignored , as the dipole moment @xmath48 is a slowly varying function with @xmath37 and the spacing between vibrational levels is large compared to the rotational splitting . for tensor operators @xmath49 of rank 0 , 1 , and 2 the relationship between cartesian @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath23 components and spherical @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 components can be found in refs .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ he ] ) , are obtained by the direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix including rotational states @xmath3 from @xmath55 up to some value @xmath56 . for the external electric field strength and @xmath3 values of interest , @xmath57 is sufficient for convergence . </S>",
    "<S> we label the eigenenergies by @xmath58 with corresponding eigenvectors @xmath59 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath60 is an integer index with values @xmath61 , such that the eigenstate @xmath62 adiabatically connects to the electric field - free eigenstate @xmath63 with @xmath64 . </S>",

    "<S> now we are able to calculate the dynamic polarizability of the mixed rotational eigenstates at laser frequency @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is determined by the properties of the operator @xmath73 defined by @xcite @xmath74 with @xmath75 enumerating eigenstates of the ground as well as excited electronic potentials in the presence of the electric field and @xmath76 or @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on the @xmath13 and @xmath14 levels and without loss of generality assume that the @xmath50 axis of our coordinate system lies in the plane spanned by the electric - field direction and the orientation of the linearly - polarized laser light . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we are interested in the situation where the level shifts due to the laser are small compared to those induced by the electric field . for the isolated levels with m=0 , the polarizability is determined by the diagonal matrix element @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath65 dynamic polarizability needs to be treated by degenerate perturbation theory within the two - dimensional subspace @xmath67 and @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , our choice of the @xmath50 direction and the symmetry properties of the dynamic polarizability ensure that the linear combinations @xmath79 with @xmath80 are the correct eigenstates . for these states the dynamic polarizability @xmath81 . for diatomic species , only the diagonal elements @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 are nonzero . hence in an oscillating electric field @xmath85 ( where @xmath86 is the complex unit vector indicating the polarization ) , the state @xmath87 shifts in energy by an amount @xmath88 given by @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> the sum is over the spatial indices @xmath90 .    </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in near infrared laser frequencies , which are detuned away from resonances with rovibrational levels of the electronically excited potentials . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we focus on wavelengths between 1000 nm and 1100 nm . starting from the @xmath5 vibrational level of the x@xmath6 states of krb and rbcs , photons of this wavelength do not possess sufficient energy to reach rovibrational levels of the electronically excited singlet @xmath91 potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the photons do have enough energy to reach vibrational level of the triplet b@xmath92 potential considering only single - photon excitations . </S>",
    "<S> however , such transitions require relativistic spin - orbit coupling to the a@xmath6 potential to acquire a non - zero dipole matrix element ; such spin - orbit induced couplings are small enough to neglect under the conditions of interest here .    </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to make several approximations . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we can use non - relativistic potentials and transition dipole moments and in the calculation of the dynamic polarizability only consider singlet @xmath6 and @xmath93 potentials . secondly , assuming a large detuning ( such that @xmath94 for all states of interest ) we can neglect the electric field and rotational dependence of the energy denominators in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ operator_def ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find that in the near infrared the contribution to the polarizability from intermediate states @xmath75 in the ground x@xmath6 state is small .    with this in mind </S>",
    "<S> the polarizability becomes @xmath95 where the energy @xmath96 is a typical vibrational energy in the ground state potential , and the rovibrational wavefunctions @xmath97 of the electronically excited states with approximate energy @xmath98 are given by @xmath99 where the vibrational and electronic dependence has been isolated in the ket @xmath100 and the rotational dependence in @xmath101 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the wavefunction @xmath102 is the radial rovibrational wavefunction , the ket @xmath103 is the electronic state with projection quantum number @xmath104 defined along the internuclear axis , and @xmath105 is a wigner rotation matrix that describes a symmetric top rotational wavefunction . </S>",
    "<S> the sum over @xmath104 includes both positive and negative values , where @xmath106 corresponds to excited @xmath6 electronic states and @xmath107 to @xmath93 states .    </S>",
    "<S> as stated before the energy of the excited state and @xmath102 depend on the electronic state @xmath108 and vibrational level @xmath109 , but not @xmath110 and @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the transition dipole moments separate into @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is an integral of the product of three wigner rotation matrices @xmath105 over the orientation of the molecule @xmath114 that can be evaluated using angular momentum algebra @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we have verified that @xmath115 is nearly independent of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the sums over @xmath110 and @xmath111 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ excited ] ) can now be performed and we finally find @xmath116 with the @xmath104-dependent @xmath117 the parallel @xmath118 and perpendicular @xmath119 contributions to the polarizability are due to transitions to the @xmath120 and @xmath121 states , respectively . + * magic dc electric field * +     of the @xmath22=0 , @xmath60=0 and 1 levels of the x@xmath6 ground state of krb ( top row ) and rbcs ( bottom row ) as a function of the field strength of an external electric field . </S>",
