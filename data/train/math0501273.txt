    "many simply connected , smoothable topological 4manifolds ( with @xmath3 odd ) are known to admit infintely many distinct smooth structures . the existence of such _",
    "exotic _ structures are , however , less clear when the euler characteristic of the 4manifold is small , for example if the manifold is homeomorphic to the ( blow  up of the ) complex projective plane . using the rational blow  down construction @xcite together with knot surgery @xcite in double node neighborhoods @xcite , many new smooth 4manifolds have been discovered with @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "similar ideas can be applied to get examples of irreducible exotic simply connected 4manifolds with @xmath1 and relatively small @xmath6 .",
    "the study of exotic structures on simply connected manifolds with @xmath1 has a rich history .",
    "recall that the @xmath7 surface @xmath8 is such an example with @xmath9 . applying appropriate logarithmic transformations on @xmath8",
    "it was shown that @xmath10 admits infinitely many smooth structures @xcite",
    ". later works , relying on gompf s symplectic normal connected sum operation , together with donaldson theory showed that the topological manifolds @xmath11 with @xmath12 admit infinitely many smooth structures @xcite .",
    "more recent results of park @xcite proved the same statement with @xmath13 .",
    "our main result in this paper improves this bound :    [ t : m1 ] the simply connected topological 4manifold @xmath0 admits infinitely many distinct smooth structures .    by modifying the construction used in the proof of theorem  [ t : m1 ] , we can define a set of 4manifolds which still have @xmath1 , but their euler characteristic is smaller than the above examples .",
    "in these cases , however , we were unable to show that the manifolds are simply connected .",
    "[ t : m2 ] there are infinitely many pairwise nondiffeomorphic smooth , closed 4manifolds with vanishing first homology , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and nontrivial seiberg  witten invariants .",
    "the proof of the results will involve two steps .",
    "first we desribe how to construct the manifolds claimed and then we use seiberg  witten theory in proving that they are nondiffeomorphic . in the construction",
    "we will apply mapping class group arguments and the theory of lefschetz fibrations . using the knot surgery construction",
    "then we can identify configurations of curves in the resulting 4manifolds which can be rationally blown down , leading us to the desired examples .",
    "recall that a genus1 lefschetz fibration @xmath14 can be described by the word in the mapping class group @xmath15 of the 2torus @xmath16 corresponding to the monodromy presentation of @xmath17 .",
    "more precisely , a point @xmath18 where @xmath19 is not onto ( called a singular point of the fibration ) gives rise to a singular fiber @xmath20 , and the monodromy of the fibration around such a fiber can be given by the composition of dehn twists along the circles corresponding to the vanishing cycles of the singular points of the fiber . by traversing through the singular fibers in a counterclockwise manner relative to a fixed base point @xmath21 , we get the above mentioned word describing the fibration .",
    "notice that we do not assume that @xmath17 is injective on the set of its singular points , that is , a singular fiber can contain more than one singular points .",
    "the assumption that the map @xmath17 is a lefschetz fibration implies that the vanishing cycles corresponding to the singular points in one fixed singular fiber can be chosen to be disjoint .",
    "it is known that the mapping class group @xmath15 can be generated by two elements @xmath22 which are subject to the two relations @xmath23 in fact , @xmath15 can be shown to be isomorphic to @xmath24 by mapping @xmath25 to @xmath26 and @xmath27 to @xmath28 .",
    "since the forgetful map from the mapping class group @xmath29 of the 2torus with one marked point to @xmath15 is an isomorphism , we get that any genus1 lefschetz fibration admits a section .",
    "genus1 lefschetz fibrations were classified by moishezon @xcite , who showed that after a possible perturbation such a fibration over @xmath30 is equivalent to one of the fibrations given by the words @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) in @xmath15 .",
    "the resulting 4manifold is usually called @xmath33 ( the simply connected elliptic surface with section and of holomorphic euler characteristic @xmath34 ) , and @xmath8 is the famous @xmath7 surface .",
    "it can be shown that a section of @xmath35 has self  intersection @xmath36 .",
    "following @xcite we call a fiber with monodromy conjugate to @xmath37 of _ type @xmath38 _ ( @xmath39 ) . when @xmath40 , the corresponding fiber is also called a _",
    "fishtail _ fiber .",
    "it is easy to see that topologically a singular fiber of type @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is a plumbing of @xmath43 smooth 2spheres of self ",
    "intersection @xmath44 plumbed along a circle ( see @xcite ) , while a fishtail fiber is an immersed 2sphere with one positive double point . since in @xmath16 nonisotopic simple closed curves necessarily intersect each other , it is easy to see that a genus1 lefschetz fibration can have only @xmath41fibers as singular fibers .",
    "the fibration @xmath17 can be perturbed near a singular fiber @xmath45 of type @xmath41 into a fibration @xmath46 which is the same as @xmath17 outside of @xmath45 but breaks @xmath45 into two singular fibers of types @xmath47 and @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "this fact implies that a generic genus1 lefschetz fibration admits only fishtail fibers . in our study",
    "however , we will find it most helpful to understand what kind of other singular fibers an elliptic fibration can admit .",
    "we start with a proposition showing the existence of a particular genus1 fibration on @xmath8 .    [",
    "p : mcg ] there exists an elliptic lefschetz fibration on the @xmath7 surface @xmath8 with a section , a singular fiber @xmath45 of type @xmath51 , three singular fibers @xmath52 of type @xmath53 and two further fishtail fibers .",
    "it is not hard to see that the word @xmath54 ( defining a genus1 lefschetz fibration on the @xmath7 surface @xmath8 ) in the mapping class group @xmath15 of the torus is equivalent to @xmath55 ( alternatively , by substituting @xmath25 and @xmath27 with the matrices they correspond to under the map @xmath56 , we can check that the above product is equal to the identity matrix . ) by collecting the powers of @xmath25 in the front using conjugation , we get @xmath57 followed by the product of three squares of some conjugates of @xmath27 and two further conjugates of @xmath27 . since a conjugate of @xmath27 by a word @xmath58 corresponds to the dehn twist along the image under the diffeomorphism @xmath59 of the curve inducing @xmath27 , the proposition follows .",
    "as we already mentioned , genus1 lefschetz fibrations always admit sections .",
    "perturb first the above fibration near the @xmath53 fibers @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) in a way that these give rise to fishtail fibers @xmath62 with isotopic vanishing cycles .",
    "let us denote the resulting lefschetz fibration by @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath64 be three twist knots as depicted in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath65 denote the 4manifold we get after performing three knot surgeries with knots @xmath64 along three regular fibers in the fibration on the @xmath7 surface found above .",
    "because of the existence of fishtail fibers in the complement with nonisotopic vanishing cycles , we conclude that @xmath66 .",
    "if we perform the surgeries in the double node neighborhoods near the fishtail fibers @xmath67 , and @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively , then we can find a pseudo ",
    "section @xmath70 as in @xcite which is an immersed sphere of self  intersection @xmath71 with three positive double points , intersecting the further fishtail fibers and the @xmath51 fiber @xmath45 transversally .",
    "next smooth the intersections of this pesudo ",
    "section @xmath70 with two further fishtail fibers .",
    "the result is an immersed sphere of self  intersection 2 having 5 positive double points .",
    "now blow up the 4manifold @xmath65 in the five double points of this sphere , and find an embedded sphere of self ",
    "intersection @xmath72 in @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath74 denote the tubular neighborhood of the linear plumbing of spheres given by this @xmath75sphere together with 14 of the @xmath71spheres in the @xmath51 fiber @xmath45 .",
    "it is not hard to see that @xmath74 is diffeomorphic to @xmath76 in the notation of @xcite , cf .",
    "also @xcite .",
    "it is then easy to show that @xmath77 can be given as the oriented boundary of the rational ball @xmath78 , see @xcite .",
    "define @xmath79 as the rational blow ",
    "down of @xmath73 along @xmath74 , that is , @xmath80      notice that @xmath65 is simply connected , and the complement of @xmath74 in @xmath81 is simply connected since the @xmath71sphere in @xmath45 intersecting the last @xmath71sphere of the linear chain @xmath74 provides a hemisphere which contracts the generator of the fundamental group of @xmath82 .",
    "since @xmath83 surjects onto @xmath84 under the natural embedding , van kampen s theorem implies that @xmath79 is simply connected . now simple signature and euler characteristics computation together with freedman s theorem @xcite verifies the result .    for short ,",
    "let @xmath85 denote the 4manifold @xmath79 if @xmath86 the @xmath34twist knot @xmath87 .",
    "the following proposition is true in a wider generality , we restrict our attention to the special case @xmath88 in order to keep our discussion as simple as possible . using the results of @xcite the seiberg ",
    "witten invariants of @xmath85 can be easily computed .",

    "* theorem  1.1 ) the seiberg ",
    "witten invariant of @xmath93 can be computed to be equal to @xmath94 ( use the facts that the seiberg ",
    "witten function of the @xmath7 surface is equal to 1 and the alexander polynomial of @xmath87 is @xmath95 ) .",
    "this result , together with the blow  up formula shows that the five  fold blow  up",
    "@xmath96 has exactly two seiberg ",
    "witten basic classes @xmath97 which evaluate on the @xmath75sphere of the configuration @xmath74 as @xmath98 .",
    "moreover , the value of the seiberg  witten function on these basic classes is @xmath99 . now",
    "* theorem  8.5 ) implies that @xmath85 has two basic classes , on which the value of the seiberg ",
    "witten function is equal to @xmath99 , verifying the result .",
    "the 4manifolds @xmath85 provide an infinite family of smooth 4manifolds all homeomorphic to @xmath0 according to proposition  [ p : hom ] , and by corollary  [ c : nondiffeo ] these manifolds are pairwise nondiffeomorphic .",
    "therefore the set @xmath100 provides an infinite collection of distinct smooth structures on @xmath0 , hence the proof is complete .      using a variation of the above procedure ,",
    "closed 4manifolds with @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be constructed as follows .",
    "consider the fibration @xmath63 found above , containing a singular fiber of type @xmath51 and eight fishtail fibers , out of which three pairs @xmath101 ( @xmath61 ) have isotopic vanishing cycles .",
