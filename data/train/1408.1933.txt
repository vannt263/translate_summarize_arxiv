    "this extra operation reduces the number of independent degrees of freedom in the ab - initio electronic structure by a factor of two , allowing us to deduce the fermi surface of the 1-fe model . specifically , the glide - mirror group has two one - dimensional irreducible representations on the @xmath14 and @xmath142 planes ( @xmath167 is equivalent to @xmath142 ) , given by @xmath168 and @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is a translation by lattice vector @xmath171 and @xmath172 is the glide - mirror operation , with @xmath173 the vector connecting the two translationally inequivalent iron atoms .",

    "the irreducible representations @xmath156 and @xmath157 each contain one half of the bands from the two iron primitive cell and are related by the folding vector @xmath165 , i.e. , @xmath176 , which means that each of the irreducible representations @xmath177 represents one 1-fe model with the needed folding vector . when the fermi surface is unfolded according to this prescription , the ellipticity of the overlapping electron pockets can be unambiguously resolved and the unfolded fermi surface shown in either fig .",

    "<S> , an interesting aspect of the fe - based superconductors ( fesc ) is their multiband nature with several hole and electron pockets . </S>",
    "<S> after band reconstruction in the spin density wave ( sdw ) phase , some of these pockets can disappear due to the increase of the sdw potential with lowering temperature . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a combined study of electron raman and hall conductivity on srfe@xmath2as@xmath2 has reported signatures of such a transition  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this motivates us to study the effects of such transitions on the charge transport of the fesc . using a model where current relaxation is due to impurity scattering , we find remarkably strong signatures of such transitions in both the average resistivity @xmath5 and the resistivity anisotropy @xmath6 that are consistent with known experimental trends of these quantities .    </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath7-plane anisotropy of the resistivity @xmath8 of the strain detwinned crystals below the structural transition temperature @xmath9 has an intriguing sign with the shorter @xmath10 axis being more resistive than the longer @xmath11 axis  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy weakens upon entering the sdw phase even though the magnetic order by itself breaks @xmath12 symmetry . </S>",

    "<S> the behavior of the average resistivity @xmath5 , which has received considerably less attention , is also highly unusual  @xcite . in the parent compounds and lightly doped systems , @xmath5 falls abruptly below the sdw transition at @xmath3 , in dramatic contrast with conventional sdw systems such as cr .    </S>",

    "<S> note that , in the 122 systems , where the anisotropy has mostly been studied , the band structure poses an additional challenge , since the ellipticity of the electron pockets vary along the @xmath13 axis ; the ellipticity at @xmath14 and @xmath15 planes have opposite signs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , in theories where the sign of @xmath6 is determined by the ellipticity @xmath16 of the electron pockets on each @xmath13 plane , such as those involving spin fluctuation scattering , at least a partial cancelation is expected after the @xmath13 average , and the total @xmath6 will depend on details of the band structure .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , to the best of our knowledge , there is no theory of the characteristic drop in the average resistivity @xmath17 immediately below @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , it is important to simultaneously account for this unusual feature of @xmath5 in addition to @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> a drop in the inverse drude weight below @xmath3 has been recovered in simulations @xcite and _ ab initio </S>",
    "<S> _ calculations  @xcite , but this quantity is distinct from the resistivity and includes no information about the scattering mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , the sharp drop in @xmath5 below @xmath3 can be understood in terms of a collapse in the scattering rate due to the decrease in phase space upon partial gapping of the fermi surface , which then overcompensates the loss of carriers . however , since these two competing effects have the same physical origin , namely the growth of the sdw amplitude with decreasing @xmath4 , the challenge here is to understand why the scattering rate collapse dominates the resistivity , at least in the undoped and lightly doped compounds , and whether this collapse is dominated by the elastic or inelastic scattering channel .    </S>",

    "<S> ( iii ) consistent with our earlier study  @xcite , we find that extended anisotropic impurity states aligned along @xmath11 direction give rise to @xmath26 in the paramagnetic state . </S>",

    "<S> the magnitude of the net anisotropy is always less than that in the paramagnetic state , i.e. , @xmath136 . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to loss of @xmath91 accompanying the lt ( presumably , the associated gain in carrier lifetime does not affect @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the lt scenario is able to explain why the resistivity anisotropy of the undoped and lightly doped systems decrease as one goes below @xmath3 in the sdw phase even though the sdw itself breaks @xmath12 symmetry . furthermore , for @xmath137 , @xmath138 increases with decreasing @xmath24 , which is consistent with the observation that the resistivity anisotropy in the sdw phase increases with sufficient doping  @xcite . finally , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] we show the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath139 and @xmath27 for @xmath140 ( intermediate doping ) with @xmath141 .     at @xmath142 for a two - plane model with isotropic scatterers . </S>",
    "<S> ( b)(c ) same at @xmath143 , respectively , for a two - plane model with anisotropic scatterers . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) average of ( b ) and ( c ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions._we studied how @xmath4-driven lifshitz transitions , where fermi pockets disappear due to an increasing sdw potential , affect the average resistivity @xmath5 and its anisotropy @xmath6 of fesc in the magnetic phase . by fitting experimental data </S>",
    "<S> , we argued that the dominant current relaxation mechanism in these materials is impurity scattering . </S>",
    "<S> we considered both pointlike and extended impurity ( nematogen ) potentials , and showed that the characteristic drop in @xmath82 is due to lifshitz transitions in a dirty sdw metal . </S>",
    "<S> next , we showed that the nematogen generated @xmath6 has the correct sign , namely the direction with longer lattice constant is less resistive . within this model , the anisotropy in the paramagnetic phase is independent of the sign of the ellipticity of the electron pockets . in the sdw phase , </S>",
    "<S> the above holds approximately when the sdw potential is weak enough . </S>",
    "<S> the qualitative physics discussed here is general enough to be of potential interest for transport in other multiband systems showing density wave instabilities .    </S>",
