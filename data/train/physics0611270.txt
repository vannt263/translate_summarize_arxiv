    "propagation of light through atmospheric turbulence is the subject of intensive research owing to the many applications in free space laser communications @xcite . in these applications",
    "it is desirable to reduce the turbulence effects on the propagating light .",
    "one promising possibility to achieve this goal is by using temporally partially coherent optical field consisting of multiple laser beams with different wavelengths @xcite .",
    "indeed , in a typical setup in which the detector s response time is large compared with the inverse of the frequency difference between any pair of beams in the input field , rapidly oscillating contributions to the total intensity average out .",
    "consequently , one can expect smaller values of high moments of the intensity compared with corresponding single beam values .",
    "this would result in smaller values for the scintillation index and for the average signal to noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "generation of temporally partially coherent light consisting of multiple beams with different wavelengths can be efficiently realized by using an array of vertical external cavity surface lasers ( vecsels ) .",
    "these devices have the advantage of generating high power , spectrally narrow , wavelength tunable @xmath2 beams ( lowest order gaussian beams)@xcite .    propagation of temporally partially coherent light in atmospheric turbulence was first studied by fante @xcite , who obtained approximate analytic expressions for the scintillation index of a single infinite planar wave .",
    "more recently kiasaleh studied propagation of an infinite multi - wavelength planar wave in weak atmospheric turbulence and showed that the achievable snr is larger in the multi - wavelength case compared with the single - wavelength case @xcite .",
    "these previous studies focused on infinite planar waves , whereas in practice , gaussian laser beams with finite initial spot size are employed . since the dynamics of the optical field can strongly depend on the initial spot size",
    "it is important to take into account the finite spatial dimension of the beams .",
    "furthermore , the optical field of @xmath0 collimated @xmath2 beams with different wavelengths depends on the wavelength separation and also on the spatial separation between the beam centers at the transmitter .",
    "therefore , one can exploit these two different dependences to reduce scintillation and optimize system performance against turbulence effects .",
    "the dependence of the scintillation index on the wavelength separation of multiple overlapping @xmath2 beams was studied in ref .",
    "it was found that for typical lasercom setups modest scintillation reduction of about 10@xmath1 can be acheived by controlling the wavelength difference between the beams .",
    "we emphasize that only the case where the beams are completely overlapping at the transmitter plane was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the current letter",
    "we focus attention on scintillation reduction by varying the spatial separation between the beams at the transmitter .",
    "we show that this approach leads to a much stronger decrease of the scintillation compared with the approach employed in ref .",
    "moreover , our approach allows us to find the initial beam separation that minimizes scintillation , thus providing a simple solution for the important problem of optimizing temporally partially coherent sources of light against turbulence effects .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we took the first step in this approach and established the framework for calculating the scintillation index for multiple partially overlapping beams in weak atmospheric turbulence . using the rytov approximation and considering a typical 2-beam system we found the initial beam separation that minimizes the longitudinal scintillation .",
    "we showed that the longitudinal and radial scintillation for the optimal 2-beam configuration are smaller by about 50@xmath1 and 35@xmath1 - 40@xmath1 , respectively , compared with the corresponding single - beam values .",
    "however , two important aspects of the problem were not addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite : ( 1 ) the @xmath0-dependence of the longitudinal scintillation reduction compared with the single - beam case , and ( 2 ) the possibility to optimize the system with respect to both initial beam separation and initial spot size . in this letter",
    "we address these two central issues in detail .",
    "consider propagation of @xmath0 collimated linearly polarized @xmath2 beams with different wavelengths @xmath3 , @xmath4 , in weak atmospheric turbulence .",

    "the intensity measured by the detector is the time average @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the response time of the detector . assuming a slow detector and @xmath29 for @xmath30 , we neglect the terms @xmath31 @xmath30 , which are rapidly oscillating with time",
    "therefore , the measured intensity is @xmath32    the total scintillation index for the @xmath0-beam system is @xmath33 where @xmath34 stands for average over different realizations of turbulence disorder . using eqs .",

    "we assume that the perturbation field in the rytov approximation is a gaussian random variable and that the turbulence is statistically homogeneous and isotropic .",

    "we consider two typical free space laser communication setups , in which the central wavelength is @xmath52 m , the wavelength spacing is @xmath53 m , all beams are collimated and have the same initial spot size and on - axis amplitude . in setup a @xmath54 km and the refractive index structure parameter is @xmath55 , and in setup b @xmath56 km and @xmath57 .",

    "these minima correspond to the optimal configurations of the @xmath0 beams for the given physical conditions and geometric arrangements , where optimization is with respect to longitudinal scintillation .",

    "it is essential to understand whether the radial scintillation of the optimal @xmath0-beam configurations , where optimization is with respect to _ longitudinal _ scintillation , is sufficiently small compared with the single - beam value .",
    "notice that in the @xmath0-beam case @xmath83 is not radially symmetric . to enable comparison with the single - beam case",
    "we define the circularly averaged radial scintillation in the @xmath0-beam case as @xmath84 , where @xmath85 denotes averaging over the angle @xmath86 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the @xmath82-dependence of @xmath87 for the optimal 4- and 2-beam configurations and for a single beam with the same power and initial spot size , all in setup a. one can see that the radial scintillation for the optimal 4-beam and 2-beam configurations are smaller by about 65@xmath1 - 80@xmath1 and 35@xmath1 - 40@xmath1 , respectively , compared with the corresponding single beam values .",
