    "since graphene was discovered in 2004 @xcite , it has brought us many surprises and opened up a new field of research in condensed matter physics and nano - electronics . from a physics point of view , carriers in graphene are massless , gapless and relativistic dirac particles with nearly linear energy dispersion .",
    "thus graphene brings us a great opportunity to look into the many - body interactions in a dirac quasi - particle system .",
    "recently the elementary electronic excitation via plasmon modes resulting from coulomb interaction has been intensively investigated for graphene based electronic systems .",
    "das sarma and hwang @xcite and wang and chakraborty @xcite have found theoretically that the plasmon frequency of the dirac fermions in graphene shows very different behaviors from the usual 2deg systems .",
    "more interestingly , it has been shown that the plasmon frequencies in graphene can be within the terahertz ( @xmath1 hz or thz ) bandwidth @xcite and 1 - 10 thz sources based on plasmon amplification in graphene can be generated for moderate carrier densities by applying the gate voltages @xcite",
    ". moreover , jablan _ et.al .",
    "_ has demonstrated that the plasmon excitation in graphene can have low losses for infrared frequencies @xcite and proposed that such a feature can be utilized for nano - photonic device applications .",
    "the results obtained from further theoretical investigations have indicated that the guided plasmon waves in graphene p - n junctions can be achieved and graphene can then be applied as a material for nano - plasmonics @xcite . however , here we notice that most of the published theoretical studies mentioned above were carried out without considering the carrier - phonon coupling in graphene and only the intra - band transition channel was taken into consideration .",
    "very recently , bostwick _ et.al .",
    "_ observed the plasmarons in free - standing doped graphene , which results from bound states of charge carriers with plasmons @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , recent experimental work has suggested that the adiabatic born - oppenheimer approximation fails in graphene because of the presence of the interactions between the peculiar dirac fermions and optic phonons @xcite .",
    "it has been experimentally demonstrated that the plasmon modes in epitaxial graphene on sic wafer can be strongly coupled with the surface optical phonon modes in silicon carbide @xcite .",
    "bostwick _ et.al .",
    "_ have found experimentally that the electron - electron interaction and the electron - phonon coupling should be considered on an equal footing to understand the properties of dirac quasi - particles in graphene @xcite .",
    "_ have experimentally demonstrated electron - electron interaction results in unique renormalizations , electron - phonon interaction diminish with decreasing doping in graphene @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the raman spectrum has now been widely used to investigate the properties of photo - excited electronic excitations in graphene systems @xcite .",
    "the results obtained from recent raman measurements have shown that the position of optic - phonon@xmath2induced g - peak depends very weakly on carrier density in the sample . however , the raman intensity around the g - peak increases with increasing doping concentration in graphene .",
    "such an effect is an identification that both the electron - electron interaction and the electron - phonon coupling affect strongly the elementary electronic excitations in graphene .",
    "these experimental findings have clearly indicated that the carrier - phonon coupling is very important in understanding and explaining the electronic and optoelectronic properties of graphene , especially the elementary electronic excitations .",
    "we know that in conventional electronic gas systems the plasmon modes can be strongly modified by phonon scattering so that the new modes , namely the coupled plasmon - phonon modes , are formed .",
    "raman scattering @xcite , infrared and photoemission measurements @xcite , and ultrafast pump - and - probe experiments @xcite , _ etc .",
    "_ have been widely applied to detect and study the coupled plasmon - phonon modes in semiconductor based bulk and low - dimensional electronic systems .",
    "the investigation of the plasmon and coupled plasmon - phonon excitations from electron gas systems is also a fundamental basis for the realization of these systems as plasmonic devices for various applications . because graphene is an ideal 2deg system with high carrier density and high carrier mobility , it is natural for us to expect that graphene can exhibit more excellent and unique plasmonic properties for device applications .",
    "thus , in order to gain an in - depth understanding of the many - body interactions in graphene systems and , on this basis , to explore the potential applications of graphene as practical nano - plasmonic devices , it is necessary and significant to examine the roles which the carrier - carrier interaction and the carrier - phonon coupling can play in such a dirac fermion system . and",
    "this becomes the prime motivation of the present theoretical investigation .",
    "here we consider a graphene sheet in the @xmath3-plane . a carrier ( electron or hole ) in a monolayer graphene can be described by the dirac equation for a massless neutrino .",
    "the energy spectrum and wavefunction for a dirac quasi - particle in graphene in the absence of the scattering mechanisms can be obtained analytically .",

    "the published experimental results have indicated that the optic - phonon coupling is a major factor in determining the intensity and peak - position of phonon - related raman spectrum in graphene @xcite .",
    "thus , in conjunction with these experimental findings , in this study we consider carrier interaction with only optic - phonons . on the basis of a valence - force - field model ,",

    "we use a matrix to present the dielectric function .",
    "in contrast to previous theoretical study in which only the intra - band transition is considered for calculating the dynamical dielectric function , the present work includes the contributions from inter - band transition channels as well .",
    "thus , the dielectric function matrix is a @xmath67 matrix . in the absence of the phonon scattering ,",

    "now we consider a n - type ( or positively gated ) graphene with an electron density @xmath76 and a distribution function @xmath77^{-1}$ ] where @xmath78 is the fermi energy ( or chemical potential ) for electrons in the conduction band .",

    "the approach can also be applied to the p - type ( or negatively gated ) graphene samples because the electrons and holes are symmetrical in graphene system . at a long - wavelength ( @xmath82 ) and low - temperature ( @xmath83 ) limit ,",

    "furthermore , a critical parameter @xmath97k@xmath87@xmath98 can be introduced to indicate the minimum momentum transfer with @xmath99 , where the plasmon mode enters to the electron - hole continuum .    including the electron - phonon coupling @xmath100 , we obtain two coupled plasmon - phonon modes , @xmath101^{1/2}\\ ] ] induced by intra - band transition for electrons within the conduction band in graphene , where @xmath102 .",
    "moreover , by solving the equation @xmath103 we acquire two coupled plasmon - phonon modes @xmath104 and @xmath105 induced via inter - band transition for electrons from valence band to conduction band in graphene system .",
    "the analytical results presented in this section show that after including the inter - band transition channels and the electron - phonon coupling , the new modes of elementary electronic excitations can be achieved in graphene .",
    "in fig . 1 , the dispersion relation for uncoupled plasmon modes , @xmath106 and @xmath90 induced respectively by intra- and inter - band transitions , are shown at a fixed electron density in graphene . as being pointed out by other authors",
    "@xcite , the plasmon frequency induced by intra - band excitation in graphene , @xmath107 , is acoustic - like and depends strongly on q. the density dependence @xmath108 in graphene differs from that @xmath109 in a conventional 2deg system .",
    "it shows that the plasmon frequency @xmath106 of graphene can be effectively controlled through tuning carrier densities by gated voltages . in the presence of the inter - band transition channels ,",
    "we obtain a new uncoupled plasmon mode @xmath90 induced by excitation of electrons from occupied valance band to the empty states in the conduction band . due to pauli exclusion principle",
    ", @xmath110 is optic - like and depends relatively weakly on q. with increasing q , @xmath106 and @xmath90 converge in regime iii .",
    "we find that @xmath106 depends more strongly on carrier density and q than @xmath90 does . for a undoped graphene sample",
    "so that @xmath111 , the plasmon frequency @xmath112 and the excitation is restricted , whereas there exits the plasmon mode with a frequency @xmath90 due to inter - band electronic transition .",
    "thus , this new plasmon mode can be used to investigate the collective electronic excitation from an nearly intrinsic graphene . in fig . 1",
    ", we also show the regimes iii and iv for @xmath113k@xmath87 within which the spe can take place .",
    "similar to a conventional 2deg , within the spe regime the landau damping occurs so that the imaginary part of the dielectric function im@xmath114 , and that if the plasmon excitation exists in these regimes for @xmath115k@xmath87 ( see e.g. iii and iv in fig .",
    "1 ) , the plasmon modes are strongly damped and decay into the electron - hole pairs .",
    "thus , one can see that the plasmon mode @xmath106 is undamped for @xmath116 in regime i where im@xmath117 , whereas the plasmon mode @xmath90 is damped in the full regime of iii in which im@xmath118 .",
    "consequently , in graphene , the undamped plasmon excitation can be achieved via intra - band transition , while the plasmon excitation via inter - band transition is damped due to the landau damping effect .    in fig .",
    "2 , the dispersion relation for coupled plasmon - phonon modes @xmath119 and @xmath120 induced by intra - band transition is shown for different electron densities . for small values of @xmath121 ,",
    "the lower frequency branch @xmath122 is acoustic - like ( or plasmon - like ) which depends strongly on q , whereas the higher frequency branch @xmath123 is optic - like ( or phonon - like ) which depends rather weakly on q. interestingly , for relatively large values of @xmath124 , the lower frequency branch becomes optic - like and @xmath125 , whereas the higher frequency branch is acoustic - like and @xmath126 .",
    "when @xmath124 , the plasmon modes couples strongly to the optic - phonon modes and the frequencies of the coupled plasmon - phonon modes in graphene differ significantly from the corresponding plasmon and optic - phonon frequencies .",
    "the @xmath127 value , at where the two branches of the excitations change the nature of the q dependence , decreases with increasing the electron density .",
    "it is interesting to compare the results for the coupled plasmon - phonon modes in graphene with those in a conventional 2deg ( c2deg ) system . in a semiconductor based c2deg ,",
    "there exit three modes for coupled plasmon - phonon excitations induced by intra - subband transition channels via electron interaction with optic - phonons through frhlich coupling @xcite .",
    "they are : i ) longitudinal - optic ( lo ) phonon - like mode @xmath128 with @xmath129 being the lo - phonon frequency ; ii ) transverse - optic ( to ) phonon - like mode @xmath130 with @xmath131 being the to - phonon frequency ; and iii ) plasmon - like mode @xmath132 , respectively . in a c2deg ,",
    "the plasmon - like mode does not coupled markedly with the phonon - like modes and the phonon - like modes depend quite weakly on q @xcite .",
    "the reason why only two coupled plasmon - phonon modes are observed in graphene is that at the @xmath44-point , @xmath133 for graphene @xcite in contrast to a c2deg where normally @xmath134 at the @xmath44-point .",
    "the different q - dependence of the coupled plasmon - phonon modes in graphene and in a c2deg is mainly induced by different energy spectra in two electronic systems .",
    "as we know , the elementary electronic excitation is achieved via varying the energy and momentum of the electrons .",
    "thus , the energy spectrum of the electronic system determines mainly the dispersion relation of the electronic excitation .",
    "in contrast to a parabolic energy spectrum for a c2deg , graphene has a linear energy spectrum . as a result ,",
    "the dispersion relation of the coupled plasmon - phonon modes in graphene differs significantly from those in a c2deg . from fig .",
    "2 , we can also find that with increasing electron density @xmath76 , the @xmath127 value decreases , and the plasmon and phonon modes are strongly coupled .",
    "this is because the plasmon frequency @xmath135 in graphene can be comparable to the optic - phonon frequency @xmath136 at a relatively large @xmath76 .    in fig .",
    "3 , we show the dispersion relation for coupled plasmon - phonon modes with frequencies @xmath137 and @xmath138 induced by inter - band transition in graphene for different electron densities @xmath76 .",
    "we see that a strong optic - phonon@xmath2like mode with a frequency @xmath139 can be generated in graphene and the frequency of this mode depends very weakly on both q and the electron density .",
    "in contrast , the plasmon - like mode @xmath140 depends sensitively on electron density and on plasmon wavevector q. @xmath138 increases with @xmath76 due to its plasmon - like nature of the excitation .",
    "we note that both modes with @xmath141 and @xmath138 are optic - like and uncoupled with each other . for a n - type graphene ,",
    "an excitation energy @xmath142 is required to excite electrons in the valence band into the conduction band and to induce the elementary electronic excitations due to the phase - space restriction . as a result , there are always @xmath143 and @xmath144 for coupled plasmon - phonon frequencies induced by inter - band transition in graphene and these modes are undamped by the landau - damping effect",
    ".    it is known that the elementary electronic excitation can be achieved in an electron gas system through electronic transition from occupied lower - energy states to the empty higher - energy states .",
    "this includes both intra- and inter - band excitations . in a semiconductor based c2deg , because the band - gap between the conduction band and the valence band is quite large , the inter - band electronic transition requires a quite large excitation energy and thus is less possible .",
    "however , graphene is a gapless 2deg and the inter - band electronic transition in graphene can therefore be achieved via a small energy transfer .",
    "hence , the elementary electronic excitation via plasmon and coupled plasmon - phonon modes induced by inter - band transition can be more possibly achieved in graphene than in a c2deg . because the carrier density in graphene can be effectively modulated up to @xmath145 @xmath146 by applying the gate voltages @xcite , the plasmon and coupled plasmon - phonon excitations can be experimentally detected and studied by different methods @xcite .",
    "it is found experimentally that the position of the g - peak induced by optic - phonon scattering in the raman spectrum in graphene varies very little with varying the carrier density in the sample .",
    "however , the raman intensity around the g - peak depends quite strongly on the carrier density in graphene .",
    "the results from the present study show that for small values of @xmath0 , optic - phonon@xmath2like modes can be generated through coupled plasmon - phonon excitations via intra - band ( see @xmath119 in fig . 2 for @xmath121 ) and inter - band ( see @xmath137 in fig .",
    "3 ) electronic transition channels .",
    "such modes depend rather weakly on @xmath0 and @xmath76 for small values of @xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that the position the optic - phonon@xmath2induced g - peak in the raman spectrum does not change significantly with varying the carrier density in the sample , in line with the experimental finding . from fig .",
    "2 , we see that for relatively large values of @xmath124 which decreases with increasing @xmath76 , the frequency of optic - phonon@xmath2like mode @xmath119 induced by intra - band excitation depends strongly on electron density .",
    "this implies that the raman intensity around the g - peak can be altered with varying the carrier density in graphene . because the optic - phonon@xmath2like mode induced by inter - band excitation @xmath137 depends very little on @xmath76 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , the change of the raman intensity around the g - peak is mainly induced by intra - band excitation mechanism .",
    "thus , our results can be applied to understand and explain the experimental findings .",
    "these experimental and theoretical results indicate that the electron - phonon interaction can affect strongly the features of elementary electronic excitations in graphene .",
    "furthermore , the results shown in figs . 2 and 3 demonstrate that the coupled plasmon - phonon excitations in graphene can provide frequency - tunable plasmonic modes .",
    "hence , graphene can be used as plasmonic device for various applications .",
    "in this work , we have developed a tractable theory approach to study the plasmon and coupled plasmon - phonon modes in graphene in which the carrier - carrier interaction and the carrier - phonon coupling are taken into consideration .",
    "we have also included the effect of the presence of the inter - band electronic transition channels within our calculations .",
    "the main conclusions obtained from this study are summarized as follows .",
    "an acoustic - like plasmon mode with a frequency @xmath147 can be generated via intra - band electronic transition in graphene and the carrier density dependence of this mode differs from that in a conventional 2deg .",
    "this is in line with previous theoretical finding .",
    "we have found that an optical - like plasmon mode with a frequency @xmath90 can be excited via inter - band electronic transition in graphene . however , this mode is within the landau - damping regime .",
    "we have found that four coupled plasmon - phonon modes can be generated in graphene .",
    "the features of two coupled - phonon modes induced by intra - band transition channels differ significantly from those observed in a conventional 2deg system .",
    "two optic - like modes for coupled plasmon - phonon excitation can be observed via inter - band electronic transition channels .",
    "three coupled plasmon - phonon modes depends strongly on electron density and plasmon wavevector .",
    "the results obtained from this study demonstrate that if the inter - band transition channels are taken into consideration , new modes for plasmon and coupled plasmon - phonon excitations can be obtained in graphene .",
    "the properties of the plasmon and coupled plasmon - phonon excitations in graphene are very distinct from those in the conventional 2deg systems .",
    "our results confirm that the carrier - carrier interaction and the carrier - phonon coupling should be equally considered to understand the properties of elementary electronic excitation in graphene .",
