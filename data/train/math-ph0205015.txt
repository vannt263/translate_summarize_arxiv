    "to explain the idea for the proof , we decompose the wave function using the eigenspaces of the hamiltonian @xmath83 as @xmath84 this decomposition is not suitable for estimation and will be replaced by the decomposition emphasizing the role of the excited states in the next section .",
    "it is useful for the following heuristic explanation .",
    "the key ingredients for proving theorem [ th:1 - 2 ] were originated from the previous work @xcite .",
    "apart from the standard arguments based on the normal form and resonance decay , the main new idea introduced in @xcite was the concept of outgoing estimates .",
    "this concept allows us to capture the time - direction dependent information of waves .",
    "therefore , even though the @xmath7 norm of the dispersive wave may not change much in the time evolution , its  size \" will decay in time when measured in terms of  outgoing estimates \" ( see propositions [ th : t1 ] , [ th : t2 ] , [ th : t4 ] ) .",
    "thus after certain initial time , the wave function will fall essentially into the region considered in @xcite provided that it does not converge to some excited state or the vacuum .",

    "if it is , the dynamics will converge to the vacuum , the case i. if the dynamic fail this test at @xmath86 , we then ask the second question whether @xmath88 . if yes , the ground state component dominates and we are in the region ii@xmath87 , which was considered in @xcite ( formulated in a stronger form in @xcite ) .",

    "in other words , we may have @xmath94 notice that the occurrence of this scenario is due to the existence of the stable and unstable manifolds , i.e. , the dynamics may follow the stable manifold ( or the unstable manifold backward in time ) for almost infinite time .    in order to understand the dispersive wave @xmath92 at the time @xmath90 , we first notice that the radiation generated by the changes of the masses of the bound states contribute to the dispersive wave",
    ". we shall call it the local part of the dispersive wave . this local part ,",
    "responsible for the relaxation of the excited states , will always be of the same order as the main decay term and will not be small .",
    "our key observation is that the rest of @xmath95 , call the global part , is negligible when measured by an outgoing estimate .",
    "to control the local part , we apply an initial layer argument in the interval @xmath96 $ ] until it becomes small at the time @xmath97 .",
    "thus up to minor changes , we can now apply the argument of @xcite from this time and the dynamics will converge to some ground state .",
    "the essence of this approach is that it _ extracts the local relevant part of the dispersive wave while treating the global part as an error term by measuring it with an outgoing estimate . _",
    "the scheme we just described is for heuristic explanation .",
    "its precise form will be given in section 3 .",
    "for nonlinear schrdinger equations with general potentials , the analysis will be more complicated .",
    "in the two bound states case , if the condition @xmath47 fails , the decay will be much slower than @xmath98 and thus all errors have to be controlled much more accurately .",
    "the picture is even more complicated for multiple - bound states .",
    "the resonance decay may be extremely slow ( such as @xmath99 ) ; the excited states may decay to other lower energy excited states before finally decay to a ground state .",
    "so far there has been no rigorous work in this direction .",
