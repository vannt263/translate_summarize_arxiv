    "over the last decade or so the study of exact spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions of einstein s equations has been reinvigorated @xcite . recently , one of us @xcite transformed the einstein static universe into an exact physically acceptable perfect fluid solution of einstein s equations and examined the properties of the solution in familiar curvature coordinates .",
    "the emphasis there was on the importance of the integration constant that the generating technique introduced .",
    "here we transform the einstein static universe into a two - fold infinity of solutions all of which may be considered generalizations of the familiar tolman iv solution .",
    "( this solution , and its variants , is useful for the study of internal properties of neutron stars @xcite . )",
    "it is shown that no member of the class can be written explicitly in isotropic coordinates and , except for a set of measure zero , no member can be written explicitly in curvature coordinates either .    when looking for an exact solution of einstein s equations , the search most often starts from a familiar set of coordinates . the present paper serves to emphasize the important point that physically interesting solutions can be automatically excluded by this approach .",
    "following @xcite we consider spacetimes @xmath0 that can be written in the form @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 is constructed so as to make @xmath0 a perfect fluid @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is a constant , @xmath7 and @xmath8 it is important to note that @xmath0 is not a conformal transformation of the seed metric given by the case @xmath9 ( due to the restrictions on @xmath3 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath3 is not the effective gravitational mass ( @xmath10 ) of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the regularity conditions on @xmath11 are @xcite @xmath12 throughout we refer to the boundary ( where the isotropic pressure vanishes and the solution matches onto vacuum ) as @xmath13 . because of the form of ( [ newform ] ) , it is important to recall the following scaling property : if a spherically symmetric perfect fluid is represented by @xmath14 , then under the conformal transformation @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a constant , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "as an introduction to what follows , we start with a consideration of the tolman iv solution @xcite @xcite .",
    "this solution is generated here in the following way : we choose @xmath20 since @xmath21 can be absorbed into the scaling property mentioned above and @xmath22 can be absorbed into the scale of @xmath23 , there is no loss in generality in setting @xmath24 .",
    "it now follows from ( [ mass ] ) that @xmath25 the choice ( [ tolman ] ) obviously introduces a coordinate singularity at @xmath26 .",
    "this is discussed below .",
    "the isotropic pressure and energy density are given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively .",

    "the adiabatic sound speed is independent of @xmath30 and is given by @xmath31 solving for @xmath30 at @xmath13 we obtain @xmath32 which shows that @xmath33 and it follows that both @xmath34 and @xmath35 are monotone decreasing .",

    "the case @xmath36 does not correspond to a finite object and the associated total mass @xmath10 diverges as @xmath37 .",
    "this case is also distinguished by the peculiarity that all polynomial invariants of the riemann tensor vanish identically as @xmath38 .",
    "the coordinate singularity at @xmath26 plays no role throughout the range of finite objects , @xmath39 .    under the coordinate transformation @xmath40",
    "the solution appears in the more familiar form @xmath41",
    "we now consider @xmath42 where @xmath43 is and integer @xmath44 .",
    "as explained above , there is no loss in generality in setting @xmath24 .",
    "it now follows from ( [ mass ] ) that @xmath45 where @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the standard hypergeometric function defined by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the pochhammer symbol @xmath53 all these solutions are physically distinct from , but bear some similarities to , the tolman iv case @xmath54 @xcite . the case @xmath55 is treated separately in the appendix . for @xmath56",

    "[ evenpropertiesin ] .      in order to transform the foregoing solutions into explicit curvature coordinates , we must solve for @xmath83 from the generalized form of ( [ tolmantrans ] ) , @xmath84 whereas this is possible in principle only for @xmath85 , the only value of @xmath43 which we find gives a manageable metric is the tolman iv case @xmath54 . in order to transform the foregoing solutions into explicit",
