    "we should examine how much extinction and reddening there are .",
    "the extinction property in the galaxy is a well studied example ( e.g. , @xcite ) . using hi and far - infrared emission as tracers for the dust column density ,",
    "we can obtain the extinction amount by the galactic dust with reasonable accuracy @xcite .",
    "although the dust distribution and properties in the external galaxies are not well known yet , we can correct the dust extinction in the galaxies by using some indicators of the extinction with some assumptions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "how about the extinction by the intergalactic ( ig ) dust ?",
    "we have already known the fact that some metal elements exist in the lyman @xmath25 clouds even at redshift larger than 3 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it suggests that the dust grains also exist in the low - density intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "such diffuse ig dust causes the ig extinction and reddening , which may affect on our understanding of the universe significantly .",
    "one might think that the ig dust amount is negligible because such a significant ig reddening is not reported in the previous studies @xcite . however , the wavelength dependence of the ig extinction is quite uncertain .",
    "if it is gray as suggested by @xcite , a large extinction is possible with no reddening .",
    "nobody can conclude that the ig dust is negligible because of no observable reddening .",
    "theoretically , it is predicted that metals synthesized in supernova ( sn ) explosions form into the dust grains in the cooling ejecta of sne @xcite .",
    "recently , thermal emissions of such dust from two supernova remnants , cas a and kepler , are detected @xcite . in a very high-@xmath26 universe , sne of massive population iii stars formed in low mass halos , which are likely to be the main site of the first star formation , can disperse the produced metals into the igm @xcite .",
    "the dust grains may be also dispersed into the igm .",
    "therefore , the ig dust grains may exist even in a @xmath27 universe @xcite .",
    "extinction by the ig dust may affect on the determination of the cosmological parameters from observations of sne .",
    "the observed dimming beyond the geometrical dimming in the empty space of distant ( @xmath28 ) type ia sne , which is attributed to the cosmological constant @xcite , can be reproduced by the gray ig extinction without the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that the apparent brightening of the farthest sne ia ( @xmath29 ; @xcite ) can be also explained by the gray ig extinction with zero cosmological constant if the dust - to - gas ratio in the igm decreases properly with increasing redshift .",
    "therefore , to know the amount of the ig dust is also important in the cosmological context .    the evidence of the ig dust should be imprinted in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and infrared background because the dust emits thermal radiation in the wave - band from the far - infrared to submillimetre ( submm ) @xcite .",
    "although the _ cobe _ data provides us with only a rough upper bound on the ig dust @xcite , the data of _ wmap _ @xcite may be promising .",
    "the submm background radiation will give a more strict constraint on the ig dust @xcite .",
    "recently , we have proposed a new constraint on the ig dust amount by using thermal history of the igm @xcite . since the dust photoelectric heating is very efficient in the igm @xcite , the theoretical thermal evolution of the igm taking into account of the heating by dust violates the observational temperature evolution if too much ig dust is input in the model .",
    "hence , @xcite obtain an upper bound of the ig dust amount in order that the theoretical igm temperature should be consistent with the observed one .",
    "the obtained upper bound of the dust - to - gas ratio in the igm is 1% and 0.1% of the galactic one depending on the ig grain size of @xmath30  0.1 @xmath31 m and @xmath32  , respectively , at redshift of @xmath33 .    in this paper , with help of distant sne ia observation , we extend our previous approach in order to discuss the upper bounds of the ig dust extinction and reddening . in the next section ,",
    "we start from the cosmic star formation history ( sfh ) to specify the ig dust amount at each redshift . according to the assumed sfh",
    ", we can estimate ig dust extinction and reddening at each redshift theoretically . in section 3 ,",
    "we comment on observational constraints from the extinction and reddening of distant sne ia . in section 4 ,",
    "further constraints are presented by comparing theoretical and observational thermal histories of the igm .",
    "based on the allowed amount of the ig dust , we also discuss some implications from our results in section 5 .",
    "the achieved conclusions are summarised in the final section .    throughout the paper",
    ", we stand on a @xmath34-cosmology .",
    "that is , we constrain the amount of the ig dust in order that the ig dust should not affect on the determination of the cosmological parameters from distant sne ia .",
    "this is because the flat universe is favored by results of cmb observations @xcite , whereas only the matter can not make the flat universe @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the recent observations of the x - ray scattering halo around high-@xmath26 qsos suggest too small amount of the ig dust to explain all amount of the dimming of the distant sne ia ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * but see also @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "also reach the same conclusion by analyzing the observed colours of the sdss ( sloan digital sky survey ) quasars .",
    "the following cosmological parameters are adopted : @xmath35 km s@xmath36 mpc@xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "to estimate the ig extinction and reddening theoretically , we must investigate production of dust at each redshift .",
    "since dust is made of metals , a cosmological evolution of the metal amount should be specified .",
    "as metals are products of stellar evolution , therefore , we shall specify the cosmic sfh as a first step .",
    "since @xcite , researches of the cosmic sfh are extensively performed . in figure 1",
    ", we show observational star formation rates in a unit comoving density as a function of redshift .",
    "the cross and open symbols are estimated from the h@xmath25 line and the rest - frame ultra - violet ( uv ) luminosities not corrected by the interstellar dust extinction .",
    "hence these are lower limits .",
    "the filled - circles are estimated from the submm data .",
    "due to the small statistics , the uncertainty of the submm data is rather large .",
    "the real sfh is still uncertain because we do not know the suitable correction factor against the internal dust extinction . in this paper , therefore , we adopt two example models : high and low sfhs , which are shown in figure 1 as solid and dashed curves , respectively . for the low sfh case , we have employed a conservative correction factor for the internal dust extinction .",
    "the high sfh case is set to be compatible with the submm data .",
    "quantitatively , these sfhs are formulated as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the star formation rate per unit comoving density .",
    "recently , some authors suggest that a sfh like the high case is more likely ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , we discuss the high sfh case mainly in the following .",
    "data : cross @xcite and inclined cross @xcite ; from the rest - frame ultra - violet data : open - triangles @xcite , open - diamonds @xcite , open - pentagons @xcite , open - circles @xcite , open - squares @xcite , open - inverse - pentagon @xcite , open - inverse - triangle @xcite ; and from the submillimetre data : filled - circles @xcite .",
    "these points are adjusted to the cosmological parameters assumed in this paper .",
    "the solid and dashed curves are the models of high and low star formation histories , respectively.,height=302 ]    once a sfh is specified and if the instantaneous recycling approximation is adopted , the cosmic mean metallicity evolution is determined by : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the produced metal mass fraction for a unit star forming mass , @xmath44 is the current critical density , @xmath45 is the starting redshift of the cosmic star formation , and @xmath46 is the hubble constant at the redshift @xmath26 .",
    "we have assumed @xmath43 to be a constant for simplicity . if the salpeter initial mass function ( 0.1125 @xmath47 ) is assumed , @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "we assume @xmath49 in this paper .",
    "this does not affect on the results obtained in the following sections because the measure of time along the redshift is small in the high-@xmath26 universe .",
    "indeed , the cosmic metallicities in @xmath50 for various @xmath45 become nearly equal to each other if @xmath51 .    in figure 2 , we show the mean cosmic metallicity as a function of redshift . in the figure ,",
    "the lower limit of metallicity in the ly@xmath25 clouds measured from c iv and si iv by @xcite and the ranges of carbon abundance obtained by @xcite and oxygen abundance obtained by @xcite are overlaid .",
    "our theoretical estimate of total metallicity in the universe is compatible with the observed oxygen abundance in the igm .",
    "this may mean that a large part ( @xmath52% ) of metal produced in galaxies exist out of galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , our estimate is much larger than the observed carbon abundance .",
    "this may indicate that carbon is not suitable to trace the cosmic mean metallicity in the early phase since the first metal pollution is made by the type ii sne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , @xcite find [ si / c]@xmath53 .    .",
    "the solid and dashed curves are the cases of the high and low star formation histories , respectively .",
    "the starting redshift of the cosmic star formation is set to be @xmath54 .",
    "the observed range of oxygen abundance by @xcite , carbon abundance by @xcite , and lower limit of metallicity obtained by @xcite are overlaid as the shaded squares and the upward arrow , respectively .",
    "we note that @xcite find [ si / c]@xmath53.,height=302 ]    let us introduce one parameter to describe the amount of the ig dust ; the ratio of the ig dust mass to the total metal mass in the universe defined as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the dust - to - gas mass ratio in the igm . in principle , this parameter is determined by the transfer mechanism of dust grains from galaxies into the igm .",
    "although some authors have tried to solve this problem approximately ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the results are not still conclusive .",
    "this is because we must solve problems of the magneto - radiation - hydrodynamics of dusty plasma finally .",
    "here we approach the parameter @xmath0 by another way ; we constrain the parameter by using the observational data of distant sne ia (  3 ) and the thermal history of the igm (  4 ) .",
    "while the parameter @xmath0 may evolve along redshift , we treat it as a constant for simplicity .",
    "hence , the obtained values of @xmath0 in the following sections are regarded as those averaged over redshift .    a dust model must also be specified . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the `` graphite '' and the `` smoothed astronomical silicate '' models by @xcite , which can explain the interstellar dust properties in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds very well . although there is no evidence that the ig dust is the same as the galactic dust , we assume them as a working hypothesis .",
    "the grain size distribution in the igm is also quite uncertain . as a first step ,",
    "we assume all grains to have the same size .",
    "this means that the grain size in the current paper indicates a characteristic size of the ig dust ( i.e. an averaged size by a certain way ) .",
    "@xcite suggests a selection rule in the transfer of dust grains from the host galaxies into the igm ; the small grains are destroyed by the thermal sputtering process when the grains are transfered through the hot gas halo of the host galaxies .",
    "indeed , this theoretical suggestion is very interesting to realize the gray dust model .",
    "however , we also examine the possibility of the small ig grain because the suggestion of the selection rule is not confirmed observationally at the moment .",
    "in this section , we constrain the amount of the ig dust by means of observational dimming of distant type ia sne . according to @xcite ,",
    "the dimming of sne ia at @xmath57 is @xmath58 mag against the empty universe .",
    "our policy is that the ig dust extinction does not affect the interpretation of the cosmological constant .",
    "thus , we attribute the 0.2 mag dimming of sne ia at @xmath57 to the cosmological constant and regard the quoted error ( 0.1 mag ) as an upper limit of the contribution by the ig dust to the dimming .",
    "although the cosmological dimming does not depend on the observed wavelength , the dimming by the ig dust may depend on the wavelength . as the distant sne ia",
    "are observed in @xmath13 and @xmath59-bands and @xmath13-band provides a slightly more strict constraint of the ig dust than @xmath59-band , we regard the upper limit of 0.1 mag as that in the @xmath13-band . in addition ,",
    "@xcite report that the difference of the observed reddening between the local and distant sne is @xmath60 mag .",
    "although there seems to be no systematic difference , we can still consider the absolute value of the colour excess by the ig dust less than 0.03 mag . in summary ,",
    "the ig extinction and reddening from observations of distant sne ia at @xmath57 are @xmath61 mag and @xmath62 mag .",
    "suppose an observer who observes a source with a redshift of @xmath26 at a wavelength of @xmath63 in his / her rest frame .",
    "the amount of the ig extinction is given by @xmath64 where @xmath5 is the grain radius , @xmath65 is the extinction efficiency factor , @xmath66 is the light speed , and @xmath67 is the ig grain number density in a unit physical volume , which is @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the grain material density . for simplicity ,",
    "we have assumed that dust grains distribute uniformly with @xmath67 corresponding to the redshift .",
    "we do not consider any structure of the dust distribution .    in figure 3",
    ", we show the amount of the ig extinction divided by @xmath0 for a source with @xmath70 as a function of the assumed grain size .",
    "while the results for the high sfh is depicted in the figure , the extinction amount for the low sfh case is only a factor of about 1.5 smaller than that of the high sfh case .",
    "the extinction amount is independent of the grain size as long as @xmath71 .",
    "this is caused by ( 1 ) the extinction cross section ( @xmath72 ) is proportional to @xmath73 because the extinction efficiency factor , @xmath74 , is proportional to the grain size , @xmath5 , linearly , and ( 2 ) the number density of the grain has a dependence of @xmath75 for a fixed dust mass . on the other hand , @xmath74 becomes constant ( almost 2 ) when @xmath76 , so that the extinction cross section is determined by mainly the geometrical one which is proportional to @xmath77 .",
    "thus , the extinction amount is proportional to @xmath78 . when @xmath79 , grains interact with photons the most effectively , so that the amount of extinction shows a peak in both panels of figure 3 .     as a function of the ig grain size .",
    "the vertical axis is divided by the parameter @xmath0 , which is defined by equation ( 3 ) .",
    "the panels ( a ) and ( b ) are the cases of silicate and graphite , respectively .",
    "the star formation history assumed is the lower case shown in figure 1 .",
    "the solid curves indicate the extinction amount in the @xmath80 , @xmath13 , @xmath59 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 bands from top to bottom.,title=\"fig:\",height=302 ]   as a function of the ig grain size .",

    "hence , we can obtain the upper bound of @xmath0 via eq.(4 ) or figure 3 , which is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the silicate and graphite cases are shown in the panel ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the dotted and dashed curves indicate the upper bounds of @xmath0 based on @xmath88 mag and @xmath89 mag , respectively .",
    "the discontinuity of the dashed curve is due to @xmath90 ; the left of the discontinuity is positive @xmath20 and the right is negative one .",
    "the solid curve is the upper bound based on the thermal history of the igm which is obtained in the next section .",
    "the rejected area of @xmath0 is shaded ; the thin shade means the rejected area based on the sne ia extinction / reddening , and the thick shade is the area based on the igm thermal history ( section 4 ) .",
    "we show only the high sfh case .",
    "we find that , for both grain types , the upper bound of @xmath0 from the distant sne ia is @xmath91 for @xmath92 . while we have no constraint of @xmath0 for the small ( @xmath93  ) silicate grain ( panel [ a ] ) , the upper bound of @xmath0 is @xmath94 when @xmath93   for the graphite case ( panel [ b ] ) .",
    "this difference is caused by the different optical properties between graphite and silicate ; small silicate is more transparent than graphite in the optical bands . for @xmath95 ,",
    "the upper bound of @xmath0 shows a local minimum corresponding to the peak shown in figure 3 .",
    "finally , there is not any constraint of @xmath0 for a very large ( @xmath96 @xmath31 m ) grain .    , the mass ratio of the ig dust to the total metal as a function of the ig grain size : ( a ) silicate and ( b ) graphite case .",

    "as shown in the previous paper ( @xcite ) , we show that the amount of the ig dust is constrained by using the thermal history of the igm .",
    "when a dust grain is hit by a photon with an energy larger than a critical value , an electron escapes from the grain ; photoelectric effect .",
    "such a photoelectron contributes to the gas heating if its energy is larger than the mean kinetic energy of gas particles .",
    "as shown in appendix a ( see also @xcite ) , the photoelectric heating by dust grains is comparable with , and sometimes dominate , the atomic photoionization heating in the igm . of course , the efficiency of the dust heating depends on the dust amount .",
    "if a model of the igm has too much dust , the theoretical temperature of igm exceeds the observational one owing to the dust photoelectric heating .",
    "therefore , we can put an upper bound of the amount of the ig dust so as to keep the consistency between the theoretical igm temperature and the observed one . in the next subsection , we describe how to calculate the thermal history of igm affected by the dust photoelectric heating .",
    "an upper bound of @xmath0 , which represents the amount of the ig dust , is estimated in subsection 4.2 .      in this paper",

    "we neglect the effect of helium and metal production by stars on the chemical abundance for simplicity .",

    "indeed , the metal mass fraction reaches at the most @xmath106 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the number ratio of helium to hydrogen is always about 0.1 after the big - bang .",
    "a constant mass fraction ( @xmath107 ) of helium is assumed throughout our calculation .",
    "we solve equation ( 6 ) coupled with non - equilibrium rate equations for these gaseous species by the fourth - order runge - kutta scheme .",
    "these rate equations with rate coefficients and the heating / cooling rates are summarised in appendix b. in the calculation , the time - step is adjusted to being 1/1000 of @xmath108 for @xmath109 and @xmath110 for @xmath111 ( see equation [ b6 ] for @xmath112 ) .",
