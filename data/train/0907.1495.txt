    "the phase transition of site percolation on the triangular lattice is now mathematically well - understood .",
    "smirnov s proof of conformal invariance in the scaling limit @xcite has enabled to prove the convergence of critical interfaces to schramm s sle process with parameter @xmath0 .",
    "sle - based computations by lawler , schramm and werner ( see e.g. @xcite ) completed the rigorous proof of the existence and values of the so - called `` arm exponents '' for critical percolation @xcite . combining these results with kesten s scaling relations @xcite ,",
    "one gets a rather precise description of percolation near criticality in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "further ongoing work in this direction by garban , pete and schramm @xcite , where they construct the scaling limit of near - critical percolation , completes the picture .",
    "there are two ways to describe the large - scale behavior of such lattice models .",
    "the first one is to identify the scaling limit of the geometric objects ( the interfaces , the clusters ) . in the case of percolation , this is the convergence of interfaces or of collections of loops @xcite to the corresponding sle - related conformally invariant objects .",
    "note that usually , compactness arguments ( for instance in the setup of aizenman - burchard @xcite ) provide existence of subsequential limits , but that ( so far ) , the uniqueness of this limit has to rely on additional information such as conformal invariance . in recent ongoing work , schramm and smirnov @xcite have proposed an elegant setup to describe the scaling limit as a random object in a nice space , the space of `` crossed quads '' .",
    "the other way to describe the large - scale behavior of such models is more implicit .",
    "one understands the scaling limits of certain probabilities ( or their decay rate ) .",
    "this leads for instance to the identification of the so - called critical exponents for the models that had been predicted by conformal field theory , and that are often directly related to the fractal dimensions of random sets defined by the previous setup .",
    "an example of such a result is the power law for the characteristic length ( measuring the mean size of a finite cluster @xcite ) @xmath1 as @xmath2 , with @xmath3 .    in @xcite",
    ", we studied the gradient percolation model , an inhomogeneous percolation process where the density of black ( occupied ) sites depends on the location in space , that was introduced in @xcite as an approximation of more complex systems where inhomogeneity plays a central role . considering a strip of length @xmath4 and of finite width @xmath5 , with a parameter @xmath6 decreasing linearly along the vertical axis from @xmath7 to @xmath8 ( see figure [ strip ] ) , we showed that if the length of the strip satisfies @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , then with high probability , there exists a unique `` front '' , an interface between the cluster of black sites connected to the bottom of the strip and the cluster of white sites connected to the top , and the vertical fluctuations of this front are of order @xmath11 .",
    "we also proved that various other macroscopic quantities associated with it ",
    "its discrete length for instance  can be described via critical exponents related to the exponents of standard percolation : it inherits many global properties of the critical percolation interfaces .",
    "these results are all results about `` exponents '' that give information about the length , the width etc . of gradient percolation interfaces .",
    "gradient percolation in a strip.,width=377 ]    note that in this case , the `` scaling limit '' of the interface that one sees by directly `` looking at the picture '' is a straight line , even though the number of points on the interface does not grow linearly .",
    "our results however strongly suggested that in order to construct non - trivial scaling limits for the front , one should scale it by a factor of order @xmath12  instead of @xmath13 , for which one just gets a straight line in the limit ( see figure [ front_pic ] ) .",
    "however , the existence of such scaling limits was not established , mainly due to possible logarithmic corrections in all estimates coming from sle computations .    the gradient percolation interface on a scale ( roughly ) @xmath12  on a scale of order @xmath13 , one just sees a straight line.,width=453 ]    the goal of the present paper is to study the scaling limits of the gradient percolation model interfaces , by combining ideas and results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we identify a  both horizontal and vertical  _ characteristic length _",
    "@xmath14 for this model , that turns out to be the right way to scale the front .",
    "we use this length to tighten results on gradient percolation obtained in @xcite , which allows us to apply tightness arguments due to aizenman and burchard to construct non - trivial scaling limits .",
    "we then study some properties of these scaling limits .",
    "our construction shows that they are similar to interfaces in near - critical regime , studied in @xcite . on the one hand , these interfaces share the same exponents as @xmath15 , that describes limits of interfaces in critical regime . on the other hand , they are not sle curves exactly : they are rather similar locally to interfaces in _ off - critical _ regime .",
    "our results thus indicate that in a situation of inhomogeneity , where one sees self - critical interfaces that are localized where the density is close to the percolation threshold ",
    "i.e. percolation phase transition appears spontaneously ",
    "what we observe corresponds to the _ whole near - critical regime _ rather than the critical regime exactly .",
    "in particular , the interfaces that arise are not _ stricto sensu _ in the same class of universality as the critical interfaces  even if global macroscopic quantities stay comparable to what they are at criticality .",
    "this paper uses earlier results on near - critical percolation , primarily from @xcite . in this section , we recall some results that we will use .",
    "all these results are stated and derived in @xcite , and we follow the notations of this paper ( see also @xcite for a general account on two - dimensional critical percolation ) . in particular , we restrict ourselves to site percolation on the triangular lattice , with basis @xmath16 , so that the parallelogram of corners @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is denoted by @xmath19\\times[b_1,b_2]$ ] , and @xmath20\\times[b_1,b_2])$ ] refers to the existence of a horizontal black crossing in this parallelogram connecting its left side to its right side ( we use @xmath21 for vertical crossings ) .",

    "similarities with critical percolation + on the one hand , these scaling limits share some properties with scaling limits of critical percolation interfaces , i.e. @xmath15 . on the discrete level , the probabilities of arm events remain the same up to multiplicative constants ( we have stated it for @xmath267 or @xmath38 arms only , but this is true for any number of arms ) , and we have seen that this implies for instance that the discrete length remains comparable to what it is in critical regime ( this is proposition [ length_front ] ) . + in the scaling limit , the hausdorff dimension of any limit must be the same as that of critical percolation interfaces : if @xmath268 is a weak limit along some sub - sequence @xmath269 of the sequence of interfaces , then the haussdorff dimension of @xmath268 is almost surely @xmath270 .",
    "* local asymmetry + on the other hand , when the front is macroscopically far from @xmath271 , i.e. at a distance of order @xmath103 , it is by construction in a region where @xmath272 .",
    "gradient percolation thus provides a natural setting where the _ off - critical _ regime , studied in @xcite , arises .",
    "+ on the discrete level , one can notice that a hexagon @xmath273 is on the front _ iff _ there exist two arms from @xmath273 to the bottom and top boundaries of the strip ( respectively black and white ) , no matter the state of @xmath273 .",

    "+ if @xmath268 is the weak limit along some sub - sequence @xmath269 of the sequence of interfaces , the same type of _ local _ asymmetry as for off - critical interfaces in @xcite should hold for any ( small ) portion of @xmath268 located in a strip of the form @xmath282 $ ] ( @xmath279 ) : the interface turns more in one direction , on every scale . in particular , its law is singular with respect to that of @xmath15  so that gradient percolation interfaces are not strictly speaking in the same class of universality as critical percolation interfaces .",
