    "@xcite , we developed a theoretical framework for optimizing the synchronization properties of a given undirected network , as defined by maximizing the order parameter @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , we derived the _ synchrony alignment function _ ( saf ) , a functional that encodes the interplay between local dynamical properties ( i.e. , the oscillators natural frequencies @xmath19 ) and the network structure ( via the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the network laplacian matrix ) .",

    "in fact , up to a rescaling of time , these two actions are equivalent . in this regime ,",
    "the oscillators become strongly clustered about the mean phase @xmath21 such that @xmath22 for all @xmath23 , and thus eq .  ( [ eq : kuramoto ] )",

    "finally , defining @xmath56 , the pseudoinverse @xmath37 is given by @xmath57    the formulation of the pseudoinverse @xmath37 in terms of the singular value decomposition in the case of a directed network has a number of implications on the collective dynamics of networks .",

    "importantly , eq .  ( [ eq : theory12 ] ) implies that maximizing the order parameter @xmath14 is equivalent to minimizing the generalized saf , thus providing a framework for optimizing the synchronization properties of a directed network .",
    "specifically , the saf encodes the interplay between the local oscillator dynamics @xmath59 and the network structure , here represented by the left singular vectors @xmath71 and singular values @xmath72 , and can be used to optimize synchronization analytically and/or algorithmically , depending on the given constraints . in the next section",
    ", we will demonstrate the utility of the generalized saf in optimizing synchronization in directed networks for several classes of constraints .    before demonstrating the utility of the generalized saf via concrete examples ,",
    "a few remarks are in order .",
    "the saf @xmath73 for a directed network given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : theory13 ] ) represents the generalization from the undirected case .",
    "the analysis presented here for directed networks include undirected networks as a special case : for undirected networks where @xmath74 the singular values are precisely the eigenvalues of @xmath27 , and the left and right singular vectors become equal and correspond to the eigenvectors of @xmath27 . in the directed case ,",
    "the left singular vectors and singular values play equivalent roles as the eigenvectors and eigenvalues in the undirected case ; they determine the alignment of the local oscillator dynamics @xmath59 with the network structure .",
    "we note that the effective natural frequencies @xmath59 depend not only on the natural frequencies @xmath36 , but also on the coupling strength @xmath6 , nodal in - degree @xmath75 , and coupling function via @xmath76 . therefore , optimization of synchronization using the saf can generally depend on the coupling strength . however , if the oscillator coupling is not frustrated , i.e. , @xmath77 , then the system simplifies , @xmath78 , and optimization via the saf is independent of coupling strength .",
    "we now demonstrate with several examples the utility of the generalized saf for optimizing the synchronization properties of directed networks .",
    "we will study three classes of constrained optimization problems : ( i )  allocation of natural frequencies given a fixed network ( sec .",
    "[ sec3sub1 ] ) ; ( ii )  arrangement of a set of pre - chosen natural frequencies given a fixed network ( sec .",
    "[ sec3sub2 ] ) ; and ( iii )  construction of a network for a set of pre - chosen natural frequencies ( sec .",
    "[ sec3sub3 ] ) . in all cases",
    ", we will consider natural frequency vectors with mean zero , @xmath79 , and fixed , nonzero standard deviation , @xmath80 , to avoid a trivial solution .",
    "for all numerical experiments we will consider two network models : erds - rnyi ( er ) random networks  @xcite that are constructed such that a directed link @xmath81 exists with probability @xmath82 , and networks with scale - free ( sf ) degree distributions @xmath83 , @xmath84 with enforced minimum degree @xmath85 constructed using the configuration model  @xcite .",
    "the mean degree of er and sf networks is given by @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we will consider as an illustrative example kuramoto - type coupling , i.e. , @xmath88 .",
    "note that in this case , the coupling is not frustrated [ i.e. , @xmath77 ] so that the effective natural frequencies of the linearized system are precisely the natural frequencies , @xmath78 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : theory02 ] ) ] .",
    "one benefit of this choice is that , because @xmath90 is independent of the coupling strength @xmath6 , so is the optimization of the saf .",
    "however , we stress that our results can be applied of other choices of coupling function , for instance sakaguchi - kuramoto coupling  @xcite as well as coupling with higher harmonics  @xcite .",
    "we consider first the case of oscillator allocation .",
    "we assume that an underlying network structure is given , and we can freely choose the natural frequency @xmath4 at each node . in this case , the optimal choice of @xmath36 can be found analytically . by considering the expansion @xmath91 and inserting it into eq .",
    "( [ eq : theory13 ] ) , we find that @xmath92 can be minimized by placing as much weight as possible into the @xmath0-th singular vector coefficient @xmath93 .",
    "however , since the collection of left singular vectors @xmath71 tend to have non - zero mean , an additional shift is required to ensure that @xmath94 .",
    "it is straightforward to show then that the optimal choice of natural frequencies is precisely @xmath95 where @xmath96 represents the mean entry of the @xmath97 left singular vector .",
    "thus , the optimal choice of frequencies is proportional to the dominant left singular vector @xmath98 with a shift to retain a mean of zero .",
    "we now demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimal solution given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : theory14 ] ) in comparison to a random allocation of natural frequencies . specifically , we consider both er and sf networks of size @xmath99 with mean degree @xmath100 ( for sf networks we let @xmath101 ) with ( i )  the optimal choice given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : theory14 ] ) with @xmath102 and ( ii )  a set of natural frequencies drawn randomly from the standard normal distribution .",
    "we consider 50 networks each of type er and sf , and for each network we simulate eq .",
    "( [ eq : kuramoto ] ) over a range of coupling strengths for both the optimal and random set of natural frequencies . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , we plot the resulting synchronization profiles @xmath14 vs @xmath6 ( averaged over the 50 network realizations ) , indicating optimal and random natural frequency results in blue circles and red triangles , respectively .",
    "we denote results using er and sf networks with filled and unfilled markers , respectively .",
    "the optimal choice of natural frequencies clearly outperforms the random allocation over the entire range of coupling strength , leading to strong synchronization ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) even for very small @xmath6 .",
    "next we consider oscillator arrangement . here",
    "we assume that an underlying network structure is given , but rather than choosing natural frequencies freely ( i.e. , as in sec .",
    "[ sec3sub1 ] ) , we are given a set of pre - chosen natural frequencies @xmath19 that must be arranged on the network . in general , the optimal solution depends on the particular network structure and set of natural frequencies given , making analytical treatment impossible .",
    "specifically , since there are @xmath103 possible arrangements , it is infeasible to conduct an exhaustive search for the best arrangement even for a moderately sized network .",
    "we thus develop a computationally feasible solution for minimizing the saf .",
    "we propose here a simple greedy algorithm to produce an approximation of the optimal solution .",
    "initially , we arrange the set of natural frequencies ( here chosen from the standard normal distribution ) randomly on the network . then , in each step , we propose a switch of a single pair of oscillators , @xmath104 , obtain a new frequency vector @xmath105 , and compute the new saf @xmath106 .",
    "if the new saf is less than the previous saf , @xmath107 , then the switch is accepted , and otherwise it is rejected .",
    "this process is repeated until a chosen number @xmath108 of switches are proposed .",
    "we note that the initial arrangement of oscillators need not be random , and in fact we can start closer to an optimal arrangement by setting an initial arrangement that aligns closely with one or more of the dominant left singular vectors of @xmath27 , saving a significant number of proposed switches .",
    "we demonstrate the power of this approach by simulating the dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kuramoto ] ) on er and sf networks before and after the natural frequencies are rearranged using the algorithm above .",
    "we consider again networks of size @xmath109 with mean degree @xmath100 and @xmath101 , first arranging normally distributed natural frequencies randomly , then rearranging them with @xmath110 proposed switches .",
    "we plot the resulting synchronization profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , indicating the random and rearranged natural frequency results with blue circles and red triangles , respectively .",
    "we again denote er and sf networks with filled and unfilled markers . as in the case of oscillator allocation ,",
    "the system with rearranged natural frequencies significantly outperforms the system with randomly arranged natural frequencies . comparing to the results of optimal allocation that are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , in the case of pre - chosen natural frequencies the abrupt transition to synchronization occurs at a larger coupling strength ( i.e. , @xmath111 ) and the order parameters are generally smaller .",
    "nevertheless , as in the case of optimal arrangement , the order parameter curves in both fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) significantly outperforms their random counterparts .",
    "we now consider the problem of network construction .",
    "we assume that a set of pre - chosen natural frequencies is given , and a network must be build to best synchronize the oscillators .",
    "we will assume that a fixed number @xmath112 of directed links can be made .",
    "as in the case of oscillator arrangement , the problem depends sensitively on the particular set of natural frequencies given .",
    "furthermore , there is a combinatorially large number of possible networks without copied or self links that can be built , @xmath113 , which makes a full search unfeasible .",
    "thus , we again proceed algorithmically .",
    "we implement an accept - reject algorithm that is initialized with a random network .",
    "we begin by constructing a random network with @xmath112 links around the pre - chosen natural frequencies , which we ensure to be strongly - connected .",
    "next , we propose link rewiring : uniformly at random , we select a link @xmath81 to delete , and we replace it with a new link between two previously disconnected nodes @xmath114 , which are also selected uniformly at random .",
    "this yields a new directed laplacian matrix , @xmath115 , and new saf , @xmath116 .",
    "if the new saf is less than the previous saf , @xmath117 , then the link replacement is accepted , and otherwise it is rejected . as before , this process is repeated until @xmath108 proposed rewirings are considered .",
    "we highlight the effectiveness of this method by simulating the dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kuramoto ] ) on networks before and after the iterative rewiring process .",
    "we initialize the rewiring algorithm with both er and sf networks of size @xmath118 and mean degree @xmath100 and @xmath101 with normally distributed frequencies , and propose @xmath119 link rewirings .",
    "we plot the resulting synchronization profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) , indicating the random and rewired network results with blue circles and red triangles , respectively .",
    "we denote the results using initialized er and sf networks with filled and unfilled markers , respectively .",
    "as expected , the networks that are rewired to minimize the saf outperform the initial networks .",
    "similar to the oscillator arrangement case , the transition to synchronization occurs at a larger coupling strength [ i.e. , @xmath120 than in the oscillator allocation case , and it remains abrupt .",
    "we note that since the rewiring algorithm is greedy , in principle , the initial network structure may have an effect on the final network .",
    "however , we find that initializing the algorithm with er and sf networks yields very similar results , which suggests that the network initialization does not have a significant effect on the outcome of the rewiring process .",
    "having demonstrated the effectiveness of the generalized saf for optimizing a network s synchronization properties , we next investigate the role of directed network structure in the optimization of synchronization . in particular , we consider two general questions .",
    "first , what are the effects _ of _ various directed network structures _ on _ optimal synchronization ?",
    "second , what are the effects _ of _ optimal synchronization _ on _ directed network structures ?",
    "we address these questions below in secs .",
    "[ sec4sub1 ] and [ sec4sub2 ] , respectively .",
    "we begin by investigating the effects that directed network properties have on optimal synchronization .",
    "perhaps the property that differentiates directed from undirected networks is the characterization of each node by two degrees rather than one ( specifically , the in- and out - degrees @xmath121 and @xmath122 for a given node @xmath5 ) .",
    "thus , a given directed network can easily be classified with a particular degree assortativity , measuring the correlation between in- and out - degrees at each node in the network .",
    "this can be measured with the degree assortativity coefficient  @xcite , i.e. , the pearson correlation coefficient , defined as @xmath123\\left[\\sum_{i}(k_i^{\\text{out}}-\\langle k\\rangle)^2\\right]}},\\label{eq : corr0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath124 such that @xmath125 and @xmath126 indicate a positive and negative correlation , respectively , and @xmath127 indicates no correlation .",
    "the results presented in sec .  [ sec3 ] and fig",
    ".  [ fig1 ] used random networks with no correlations between in- and out - degrees .",
    "this begs the question : what is the effect of degree assortativity on optimal synchronization ?",
    "we investigate the effects of assortative and disassortative degree correlations on optimal synchronization in the cases of oscillator allocation and arrangement .",
    "in particular , given the sequence of in- and out - degrees for a particular network , we construct two new networks using in- and out - degree pairs set to maximize and minimize the degree assortativity .",
    "maximum assortativity is obtained by matching the maximum in - degree with the maximum out degree , etc . , and maximum disassortativity is obtained by matching the maximum in - degree with the minimum out - degree , etc .",
    "beginning with er networks of size @xmath109 with mean degree @xmath100 , we plot the synchronization profiles @xmath14 vs @xmath6 of the original network ( dashed curves ) and its assortative ( blue circles ) and disassortative ( red triangles ) rewirings after optimally allocating and arranging frequencies in figs .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the results represent an average over @xmath128 network realizations , and in the case of oscillator arrangement , the frequencies are normally distributed .",
    "we repeat these simulations on sf networks of size @xmath109 with @xmath100 and @xmath101 , plotting the results from optimal allocation and arrangement in figs .  [",
    "fig3](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "we note first that , while there is a difference between optimal synchronization in assortative and disassortative networks , the optimization methods presented above are effective in both cases .",
    "interestingly , we find that the effect of degree assortativity on synchrony optimization differs between the cases of optimal allocation and optimal arrangement .",
    "in particular , we observe that in both er and sf networks when oscillators are optimally allocated , disassortative networks tend to outperform assortative networks [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and fig .",

    "[ fig2](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ] .",
    "thus , we conclude that positive / negative degree assortativity in directed networks does not necessarily imply improved or diminished synchronization properties , and depends on the nature of the constraints on the optimization problem .",
    "however , we do point out that these tendencies do not appear to depend much on network heterogeneity , since the results for er and sf networks are similar .",
    "next , we investigate the effect that optimization has on a given directed network s structure . in particular , we consider the case of network rewiring and study the evolution of the degree distribution @xmath129 for both in- and out degrees @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",

    "second , we consider frequencies drawn from a much broader , heavy - tailed distribution described by @xmath133 which represents a symmetric ( continuous and piecewise - smooth ) distribution on @xmath134 that is uniform for @xmath135 and has a power - law decay with exponent @xmath136 for @xmath137 . we choose",

    "results represent an average over @xmath128 network realizations .",
    "we emphasize that the initial networks used for the cases of normal vs heavy - tailed frequencies are identical , and thus the difference in the distributions after rewiring for optimality are due solely to the effect that the different frequency distributions have on the rewiring process . noting that results are plotted in log - log format , both the in- and out - degree distributions of the initial networks are thin and in fact",
    ", they remain thin after rewiring for the case of normal frequencies .",
    "however , in the case of heavy - tailed frequencies we observe that while the out - degree distribution remains thin , the in - degree distribution becomes very wide , indicating the emergence of nodes with very large in - degree compared to the rest of the network , or hubs .",
    "these results shed some light on the role of directedness of networks in optimal synchronization . in the case of undirected networks , we found@xcite in a similar rewiring experiment that the heterogeneity of the degree distribution of an optimized network roughly matches the heterogeneity of the frequency distribution  heavy - tailed frequency distributions give rise to heavy - tailed degree distributions , and thin frequency distributions give rise to thin degree distributions .",
    "the results for directed networks provide an interesting contrast to this phenomenon .",
    "in particular , the heterogeneity of the in - degree distribution matches the heterogeneity of the frequency distribution , but no such relationship is observed for the out - degree distribution .",
    "this suggests that in the case of directed networks , in - degrees play an important role in optimizing synchronization properties , while out - degrees are much less significant . as we will see below , the role of in- and out - degrees extend to the correlations we observe between the degrees and frequencies",
    "having investigated the effects of directed network structure on optimal synchronization , and vice versa , we now consider the relationship between the structural and dynamical properties of optimal networks .",
    "in particular , _ what _ relationships between dynamical and structural properties promote synchronization in directed networks ? in our previous work  @xcite , we observed two general properties that are common to undirected synchrony - optimized networks : ( i ) a strong positive correlation between an oscillator s nodal degree and its natural frequency , and ( ii ) a strong negative correlation between an oscillator s natural frequency and the average natural frequencies of its network neighbors .",

    "in particular , a strong positive relationship is clear between natural frequencies and in - degrees , but no such relationship is clear between natural frequencies and out - degrees . to support this observation , we calculate the assortativity coefficient between the respective quantities , @xmath144\\left[\\sum_{i}(|\\omega_i|-\\langle|\\omega|\\rangle)^2\\right]}}.\\label{eq : corr2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we find that in our particular example , @xmath145 and @xmath146 .      next , we consider the relationship between natural frequencies of neighboring oscillators .",
    "we note that in the directed case , this relationship is more nuanced than in the undirected case , and therefore we consider the relationships between a given oscillator s natural frequency and the mean natural frequency of its neighbors ( i ) along in - coming links and ( ii ) along out - going links . to investigate these relationships , we define the mean neighboring frequencies , respectively , as @xmath147 physically , the mean in - frequency for oscillator @xmath5 , @xmath148 represents the mean frequency of all the oscillators that _ influence _",
    "oscillator @xmath5 , while the mean out - frequency for oscillator @xmath5 , @xmath148 represents the mean frequency of all the oscillators that are _ influenced by _ oscillator @xmath5 .    using the same network as in the previous example , we plot @xmath148 and @xmath149 in fig .  [ fig6](a ) and ( b ) , respectively , against the natural frequency @xmath4 . in both panels",
    ", one can observe a negative relationship .",
    "however , the two cases differ in their structure  note the strong `` bow - tie''-like structure in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) .",
    "this bow - tie structure is reminiscent of the frequency - frequency relationship that we previously observed for undirected networks  @xcite . to quantify this structure , we count the fraction of pairs @xmath150 that fall into each quadrant , which we indicate in the respective corners of fig .  [ fig6](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "this allows us to quantify the proportion of oscillators whose natural frequency shares their sign with the frequencies opposite incoming and outgoing links .",
    "approximately @xmath151 of the natural frequencies share a sign with their respective mean in - frequency , while @xmath152 share a sign with their respective mean out - frequency .",
    "this finding suggests that the relationship between each natural frequency and its respective mean in - frequency has a more significant effect on synchronization than the relationship with its respective mean out - frequency .",
    "finally , we investigate the evolution of a network s properties during the optimization process .",
    "again , we restrict our attention to oscillator arrangement , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec3sub2 ] , and we thus consider the evolution of a network through a process of switching the natural frequencies . throughout this evolution",
    ", we will consider the correlation between both in- and out - degrees and natural frequencies , measured by the assortativity coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr2 ] ) , as well as frequency - frequency correlations measured by @xmath153 which in this case quantifies the assortativity between neighboring natural frequencies .    in fig",
    ".  [ fig7 ] , we plot the results obtained from optimally rearranging natural frequencies drawn from a standard normal distribution on an er network of size @xmath109 with mean degree @xmath100 over the course of @xmath154 proposed switches .",
    "for context , we plot the evolution of the saf @xmath92 in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) , we plot the correlation coefficients @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 in blue , red and green , respectively .",
    "( we note that these also align from top to bottom , respectively . )",
    "results represent an average over @xmath128 network realizations . for comparison ,",
    "results for a single realization are plotted as gray curves .",
    "our main observation is that as more switches are proposed , we see a rapid shift in the saf , @xmath155 , and @xmath157 , but only a slight shift in @xmath156 . as the network s synchronization properties improve , the correlation coefficients @xmath155 and @xmath157 quickly saturate to approximately @xmath158 and @xmath159 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , @xmath156 remains small in comparison , but is on average positive .",
    "these findings are consistent with the numerical results presented in secs .",
    "[ sec5sub1 ] and [ sec5sub2 ] on the degree - frequency correlations and frequency - frequency correlations observed in optimally rewired networks .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a framework for optimizing the synchronization properties of directed networks of coupled oscillators .",
    "our results can be regarded as an extension to previous work that focused on the case of undirected networks  @xcite .",
    "our main theoretical result is the derivation of the generalized synchrony alignment function given by eq .  , which we have shown can be used to systematically optimize the synchronization properties of networks under several constraints , including oscillator allocation ( sec .",
    "[ sec3sub1 ] ) , oscillator arrangement ( sec .  [ sec3sub2 ] ) , and network construction ( sec .  [ sec3sub3 ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that this approach is efficient , does not require large - scale simulation of dynamics [ i.e. , either eq .   or eq .  ] , and is based on an objective measure of synchronization ( i.e. , a perturbation analysis of the kuramoto order parameter ) and not heuristics .",
    "the generalized saf approach presented here shows that the synchronization properties of a general directed network depends on the alignments of the natural frequency vector with the left singular vectors of the laplacian , weighted appropriately by the left singular values . in particular ,",
    "stronger synchronization is attained as the natural frequency vector becomes aligned with dominant singular vectors , i.e. , those associated with larger singular values .",
    "this is a natural generalization from the undirected case , where it was found that stronger alignments of the natural frequency vector with the more dominant eigenvectors of the laplacian promote synchronization .",
    "we emphasize that our approach is designed to maximize the kuramoto order parameter in the regime where strong synchronization may occur , but point out that even for relatively small coupling strengths the approach works remarkably well .",
    "we also point out that the method is not designed to minimize the critical coupling strength associated to the onset of synchronization .",
    "furthermore , we hypothesize that our results may be applied to better understand the effect that failures and other perturbations have on synchronization in complex networks  @xcite .",
    "to provide further insight into the mechanisms that enhance synchronization and the role of directedness , we investigated the effects that directed network properties have on optimal synchronization , the effects that optimization has on directed network structures . in undirected networks , it has been observed that after rewiring for optimal synchronization the heterogeneity of the degree distribution roughly matches the heterogeneity of the frequency distribution .",
    "we have found a contrasting phenomenon for directed networks : after rewiring for optimal synchronization the heterogeneity of the in - degree distribution roughly matches the heterogeneity of the frequency distribution ; no such relationship was found for the out - degrees .",
    "we have also studied the relationship between structural and dynamical properties of optimized networks . in the undirected case",
    ", it is well known that a positive correlation between degrees and natural frequencies and a negative correlation between neighboring oscillators frequencies promote synchronization .",
    "we have shown that these relationships become more nuanced in the directed case ; synchronization is promoted by a positive correlation between the nodal in - degree of an oscillator and its respective natural frequency , while the relationship between the nodal out - degree of an oscillator and its respective natural frequency has comparatively little effect .",
    "we also studied correlations between the natural frequencies of neighboring oscillators and found that directed synchrony - optimized networks display a stronger relationship between each natural frequency and the mean natural frequency of its neighbors along in - coming links than its neighbors along out - going links . taken together , these results indicate that in - degrees play a significant role in the synchronization properties of directed networks , while out - degrees are much less significant .      99 s. h. strogatz , _ sync : the emerging science of spontaneous order _ ( hypernion , 2003 ) .",
