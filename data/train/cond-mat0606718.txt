    "<S> the yukawa potential arises not only in diverse physical problems , but is also interesting in its own right @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the motivation for considering effective potentials in complex systems is driven by the fact that a theoretical treatment of the full mixture is often very difficult , particularly when there is a big size asymmetry between different components of the mixture . </S>",
    "<S> it is profitable to integrate out the degrees of freedom of one or more of the components , thereby incorporating formally their influence into an effective hamiltonian for the remaining particles @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a simple model for binary mixtures of charged particles suspended in a neutralising medium . </S>",
    "<S> we examine a dilute suspension of yukawa particles in a solvent with correlation length @xmath2 and we investigate the ( additional ) screening effect that the solvent particles have on the effective interaction between the solute yukawa particles . specifically </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a class of binary mixtures in which the pair potentials are of the form @xmath6 , where indices @xmath7 label the two different species and where @xmath8 is a contribution to @xmath9 that is short  ranged in comparison with the yukawa term . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes @xmath10 depend on the charges on the particles . </S>",

    "<S> we focus on the limit of the number density of the solute particles @xmath14 and investigate the form of the effective potential @xmath15 between the solute particles in this limit . in particular , we obtain the general result that when @xmath16 , @xmath17 , so that there is a yukawa tail @xmath18 present in @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath15 decays faster than @xmath21 as @xmath22 provided the solvent bulk correlation length @xmath23 . on the other hand , </S>",

    "<S> the results can be re  stated in terms of the solvent - mediated potential @xmath26 , defined via @xmath27 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 depends on the nature of the solvent and on the solvent - solute interaction . if @xmath28 faster than @xmath21 , as @xmath22 , then we describe the solute  </S>",

    "<S> the asymptotic decay of @xmath68 in the pure solvent of species 1 is determined by the pole(s ) in @xmath69 , given by the solution of @xmath70 , with the smallest imaginary part @xmath60 and the bulk solvent correlation length @xmath71 @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> if in addition , we assume that both @xmath82 and @xmath83 are finite it follows that in the limit @xmath14 , @xmath84 for @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the contribution to @xmath37 from this purely imaginary pole at @xmath80 is given by @xcite : @xmath86 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to show that in the limit @xmath14 , @xmath87 . using this result and evaluating the numerators @xmath88 </S>",

    "<S> note further that in the same limit , @xmath95 tends to a non - zero constant value @xmath96 which is independent of any properties of the solvent , i.e.  the pole at @xmath97 gives a contribution to @xmath98 of the form @xmath99 . </S>",

    "<S> when @xmath67 , the effective interaction between the solute particles is identical to the bare interaction as @xmath22 ; the solute - solute interaction is ` unscreened ' . of course </S>",

    "<S> one set of solutions to the equation @xmath76 is given by @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to purely imaginary poles at @xmath110 , provided we assume that the functions @xmath111 are well - behaved ( finite and differentiable ) on the imaginary axis around @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> the leading order pole corresponds to @xmath113 , and in the limit of vanishing density @xmath114 ( i.e.  @xmath115 ) there is a pole at @xmath116 , so that @xmath117 , @xmath22 . for small concentrations of species 2 we taylor expand @xmath118 in powers of @xmath119 and find the leading order pole is given by @xmath120 using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : amp ] ) we calculate the amplitudes @xmath121 of the contributions from this pole to the correlation functions @xmath37 : @xmath122 note that the coefficients of the leading order terms are independent of @xmath64 and that the amplitudes obey the rule @xcite @xmath123 . in the simplest model of a charged system one expects @xmath124 since @xmath125 , the product of the charges on each species . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to this situation as the ` ideal ' mixing rule @xcite . then the coefficients of the leading order terms in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : amplitudes_2 ] ) vanish identically and for all three @xmath37 the amplitudes corresponding to the pole at @xmath126 will be zero in the limit @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the asymptotic decay of @xmath36 ( and therefore of @xmath15 ) is determined by the next order pole , which generally has @xmath127 , so that @xmath128 decays as @xmath129 , i.e.  _ faster _ than @xmath21 , so that the interaction between species 2 solute particles is ` screened ' . in the physical systems </S>",
    "<S> where @xmath130 , there will still be partial screening since one expects the difference @xmath131 to be small and then @xmath15 will decay , as @xmath22 , with the same exponential decay length @xmath1 as the bare potential , but with a reduced amplitude proportional to @xmath131 . </S>",
