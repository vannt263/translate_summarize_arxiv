    "in the last decade the problem of designing optimal space - time codes for the multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) rayleigh fading channel has attracted much attention from the coding community . maximizing the _ normalized minimum determinant _ of a space - time code has been widely used as a design criterion . however",
    ", this approach concentrates on minimizing the worst case pairwise error probability ( pep ) , and does not consider its overall distribution . the _ diversity - multiplexing gain trade - off _ ( dmt ) , on the other hand , describes the asymptotic overall error probability as the signal - to - noise ratio and codebook size grow to infinity .",
    "these two criteria are independent .",
    "codes with the same dmt can have dramatically different normalized minimum determinants and vice versa .",
    "in @xcite we proposed a new criterion based on the _ inverse determinant sum _ of the code , which arises from the union bound for the pep @xcite .",

    "we also proved that in many cases the growth of the inverse determinant sums describes the dmt of a given code for multiplexing gains @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "this study evidenced how the multiplicative structure of the unit group of the code comes into play ; by considering the classical embedding of the unit group into a lie group , we provided a classification of division algebra based codes according to the growth exponent of their inverse determinant sums .    in this paper we consider a normalized version of the inverse determinant sum , which allows us to compare the coding gains of different division algebra based codes with the same growth exponent .",
    "this approach takes into account both the number of occurrences of the worst case error probability and the overall distribution . as a main result we will get a new design criterion for division algebra based space - time codes .",
    "our method follows the lines presented in @xcite combining information of the zeta - function and of the unit group of a maximal order of a division algebra .",
    "however , we tighten the previous bound and use an explicit version of lie point counting from @xcite . a central role in the analysis is played by the _",
