    "another interesting issue is the origin of the observed vacuum energy density , which is much smaller than the field theoretical prediction ; the so - called the cosmological constant problem .",
    "given the background brane solution that we are considering , the brane vacuum energy ( the brane tensions ) only contributes to the bulk geometry and therefore does not act as an energy source for today s accelerated cosmic expansion ( at the background level the branes are to be kept flat ) .",

    "whence , the vacuum energy is given by @xmath170 the coefficient acting on the renormalization scale is very similar to the quantity plotted in fig .",

    "we have also examined the _ rigidity _ of stability by comparing the ratio between comparison the effective modulus mass and the bulk curvature scales .",

    "we investigated the stability of the modulus for given values of the two brane tensions , or equivalently of @xmath32 and @xmath31 ( the deficit angle of the brane located at @xmath29 ) .",

    "( [ originaleffpot ] ) . from this",
    "the condition for the volume modulus to have a minimum ( and hence be stabilized ) is determined only by the sign of the coefficient in the logarithmic term , i.e. , @xmath132 .",
    "this coefficient is directly related to the zeta function @xmath172 and thus , the heat kernel coefficient @xmath173 .    in the actual investigation of stability",
    ", we have used an alternative model in four dimensions that has a very similar spacetime structure to the original six - dimensional model .",
    "this is because the contribution for the cone to the @xmath91 heat kernel coefficient has _",
    "never _ been formulated as far as the authors are aware .",
    "we then showed that the heat kernel coefficient is positive definite for most dilaton couplings , @xmath102 , independently of the choice of @xmath32 and @xmath31 .",
    "the contribution from the bulk is positive , whereas that from the conical branes is negative for smaller @xmath32 ; though they are of the same order .",
    "for all of the cases with @xmath174 , the bulk dominates over the brane parts and thus , the volume is _ stabilized_.    however , one might ask whether or not the stability is _ rigid _ against the various kk perturbations .",
    "this rigidity can be determined from the ratio between the effective modulus mass and the stabilized curvature radius of the bulk , as given by eq .",
    "( [ massratio ] ) , implying a knowledge of the ratio of @xmath175 .",
    "if this ratio is less than unity , then the mass of the volume modulus becomes too light and may be destabilized by other kk contributions , whereas if it is greater than unity , the modulus field is not easily perturbed from the  stabilized \" minimum .",
    "we showed that the mass ratio becomes larger for larger coupling @xmath102 , which is proportional to @xmath151 and therefore , stability is _",
    "rigid_. for larger degrees of warping , i.e. , for smaller value of @xmath32 , other than @xmath176 , we found that the stabilized modulus mass becomes relatively light and that this ratio is not so sensitive to different values of deficit angle @xmath31 .",
    "note that it only exhibits a divergence at @xmath177 , where the bulk essentially vanishes .",
    "then , we made some suggestions for the six - dimensional case and by comparing the bulk part with that of the four - dimensional @xmath178 bulk part we found similar behavior indicating that our conclusion in four dimensions will carry through to the six - dimensional case : the modulus can be stabilized and furthermore our approximate wkb approach suggests that the mass of the modulus leads to rigidity for certain couplings and parameters .",
    "of course , once formal expressions for the six - dimensional conical heat kernel coefficients are found , then we can extend the same analysis as that employed in this paper .",
    "however , a more accurate ( semi - analytical / numerical ) method to evaluate @xmath179 should be found , rather than the approximate wkb eigenvalue method that we used in this article .",
    "we also discussed some phenomenological issues , i.e. , the hierarchy problem of the fundamental energy scales and the extremely tiny value of the observed vacuum energy density .",
    "the six - dimensional results were extrapolated from the corresponding results in four dimensions . we found that in the hierarchy problem , the ratio between the energy scale of the brane localized field and the gravitational scale becomes much smaller than unity , especially for larger degrees of warping @xmath180 .",
    "furthermore , the effective vacuum energy density can also be much smaller than the gravitational scale .",
    "the vacuum energy is negative by definition and we therefore need some kind of uplifting mechanism , to obtain a more realistic cosmology . in these cases , as was mentioned previously , the mass of the volume modulus may also be small and thus , might be destabilized .",
    "it is also interesting to compare our results with the codimension one case .",
    "an important difference is that in the codimension one case all the moduli are not dynamically fixed and should be stabilized by quantum corrections of bulk fields ; however in the codimension two case at least one of the moduli fields is fixed dynamically , because the brane tensions are directly related to the bulk geometry . in terms of heat kernel coefficients another obvious difference is that we are considering even dimensions . in odd dimensions only boundary terms occur and",
    "thus , the renormalization only affects the brane tensions , whereas in even dimensions there is a bulk contribution and hence logarithmic terms appear .",
    "probably the most important difference is that the stabilization of the volume modulus can be realized by the contribution from the bulk , not from the branes , for small warpings . for @xmath180 ( large warpings )",
    "the stabilized modulus effectively behaves as a very light scalar field on the brane , which is somewhat similar to the codimension one case , e.g. , see  @xcite .    before closing this article we shall refer to some extensions of this work :",
    "one issue is to do with the quantum corrections of other fields , such as the magnetic flux and graviton .",
    "the tensor part of the graviton perturbations should be equivalent to a minimally coupled scalar field , which we investigated in this article and such analyses might give us important insights into warped flux compactifications with self - gravitating branes . besides quantum effects , there are many interesting issues that still remain in codimension two braneworld , e.g. , gravitational waves in the bulk  @xcite , non - linear dynamics of the bulk and branes , thick branes and so on",

    "<S> we investigate the stability of the extra dimensions in a warped , codimension two braneworld that is based upon an einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory with a non - vanishing scalar field potential . </S>",
    "<S> the braneworld solution has two 3-branes , which are located at the positions of the conical singularities . for this type of brane solution </S>",
    "<S> the relative positions of the branes ( the shape modulus ) are determined via the tension - deficit relations , if the brane tensions are fixed . however , the volume of the extra dimensions ( the volume modulus ) is not fixed in the context of the classical theory , implying we should take quantum corrections into account . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we discuss the one - loop effective potential of the volume modulus for a massless , minimally coupled scalar field . given the scale invariance of the background solution , the form of the modulus effective potential can _ only _ be determined from the sign of the logarithmic term in the effective potential that depends on the renormalization scale . </S>",
    "<S> this term can be evaluated via heat kernel analysis and we show that in most cases the volume modulus is stabilized . in the actual evaluation , due to a lack of knowledge of the uv contributions from the conical branes in a six - dimensional spacetime , we consider its four - dimensional counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> we then go on to discuss the mass scale of the modulus itself and find that it becomes comparable to the gravitational scale for mild degrees of warping , when the renormalization scale is set nominally to the gravitational scale . </S>",
    "<S> then , we make some suggestions on the original six - dimensional model . finally , we close this article , after discussing some phenomenological implications relating to the hierarchy problem of the fundamental energy scales and the smallness of the effective vacuum energy on the brane . </S>",
    "<S> we find that one - loop corrections in this model appear to alleviate some of these problems . </S>"
