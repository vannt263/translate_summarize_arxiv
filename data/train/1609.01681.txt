    "it is well known that a non - uniform high - frequency electromagnetic ( em ) field can produce a time - averaged force , known as the ponderomotive force , on any particle that is charged or , more generally , has nonzero polarizability @xcite . this effect has permitted a number of applications ranging from atomic cooling to particle acceleration @xcite , but many other interesting opportunities remain .",
    "in particular , similar manipulations can be practiced on waves too . as shown recently in",
    ", any wave propagating through a temporally and ( or ) spatially modulated medium generally experiences time - averaged refraction determined by the modulation intensity @xcite .",
    "it was also shown in that this `` ponderomotive effect on waves '' subsumes the ponderomotive dynamics of particles as a special case because , quantummechanically , particles can be represented as waves too .",
    "however , assumes that the wave period ( both temporal and spatial ) is much smaller than the modulation period .",
    "this approximation limits the applicability of the theory .",
    "one may wonder then whether it can be relaxed ( without specifying the type of waves being considered ) and whether new interesting physics can be discovered then .    here",
    "we answer these questions positively by proposing a more general theory of the ponderomotive effect on waves . for simplicity",
    ", we consider scalar dissipationless waves , but , in contrast with , our theory can describe waves with temporal and spatial period comparable to that of the modulation ( provided that parametric resonances are avoided ) . using the weyl calculus , we explicitly derive the effective dispersion operator that governs the time - averaged dynamics of a wave in a quasiperiodically modulated medium . this result is later used to obtain the wave _ ponderomotive hamiltonian _ .",
    "this formulation can be understood as a generalization of the oscillation - center ( oc ) theory , which is known from classical plasma physics @xcite , to any linear waves and quantum particles in particular .",
    "our theory also shows that _ any wave is , in fact , a polarizable object _ that contributes to the linear dielectric tensor of the ambient medium . as an illustration ,",
    "ponderomotive energies of quantum particles and photons are calculated within a number of models and compared with simulations .",
    "in particular , we find that quantum effects can change the sign of the ponderomotive force .",
    "we also explain a fundamental connection between these results and the commonly known expression for the quantum - plasma electrostatic dielectric function .",
    "this work also serves as a stepping stone to improving the understanding of the modulational instabilities in general wave ensembles , as will be reported separately .",
    "it is to be noted that effective hamiltonians for temporally driven systems have been studied in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "however , these studies are mainly focused on systems described by the schrdinger equation and use the modulation period as the small parameter .",
    "in contrast , we study more general waves and expand in the modulation amplitude rather than period . this way , we can calculate the ponderomotive effect on waves using the weyl calculus , which provides a direct connection with classical physics and the aforementioned oc theory in particular .",

    "let us consider pws in groups @xmath282 such that , within each group , pws have the same ponderomotive frequency shift @xmath283 .",
    "then , we can rewrite @xmath269 as follows : @xmath284 where @xmath285 $ ] .",
    "this gives @xmath286 , where the lagrangian density @xmath287 is @xmath288    the meaning of @xmath289 is understood as follows .",

    "this relation represents a generalization of the well - known `` @xmath308-@xmath309 theorem '' @xcite , which establishes the same equalities for classical particles , to general waves .",
    "those include quantum particles as a special case and also photons , plasmons , phonons , etc . according to the theory presented here",
    ", any such object can be assigned a ponderomotive energy and thus has a polarizability .",
    "some examples are discussed below .      as a first example , let us consider a nonrelativistic quantum electron with charge @xmath176 , mass @xmath175 , and oc momentum @xmath310 .",
    "suppose the electron interacts with an electrostatic mw ( so @xmath311 ) .",

    "the susceptibility of nondegenerate @xcite plasma formed by such electrons is  @xcite @xmath315 which is precisely the textbook result @xcite .",
    "this shows that the commonly known expression for the dielectric tensor of quantum plasma is actually a reflection of the less - known quantum ponderomotive energy .",
    "second , consider an em wave in a nonmagnetized density - modulated cold electron plasma .",
    "using gauss s law , one readily finds that @xmath316 , where we assume the same notation as in . then , using , one gets @xmath317 where @xmath318 is a dyadic tensor , and @xmath257 is given by . ( the factor @xmath152 is introduced in order to treat @xmath153 as a per - photon energy rather than as a classical frequency . ) hence , gives that the photon polarizability is @xmath319 in principle , one must account for this polarizability when calculating @xmath306 ; photons contribute to the linear dielectric tensor just like electrons and ions .",
    "that said , the presence of @xmath152 in makes the photon relatively small .",
    "hence , ignoring the photon contribution to the plasma dielectric tensor is justified except at large enough photon densities .",
    "similar calculations are also possible for dissipative dynamics and vector waves and also help understand the modulational dynamics of wave ensembles in a general context . however , elaborating on these topics is outside the scope of this paper and is left to future publications .",
    "in this work , we show that scalar waves , both classical and quantum , can experience time - averaged refraction when propagating in modulated media .",
    "this phenomenon is analogous to the ponderomotive effect encountered by charged particles in high - frequency em fields .",
    "we propose a covariant variational theory of this `` ponderomotive effect on waves '' for a general nondissipative linear medium .",
    "using the weyl calculus , our formulation is able to describe waves with temporal and spatial period comparable to that of the modulation ( provided that parametric resonances are avoided ) .",
    "this theory can be understood as a generalization of the oscillation - center theory , which is known from classical plasma physics , to any linear waves or quantum particles in particular .",
    "this work also shows that any wave is , in fact , a polarizable object that contributes to the linear dielectric tensor of the ambient medium .",
    "three examples of applications of the theory are given : a schrdinger particle propagating in an oscillating electrostatic field , a klein  gordon particle interacting with modulated em fields , and an em wave propagating in a density - modulated plasma .",
    "this work can be expanded in several directions .",
    "first , one can extend the theory to dissipative waves @xcite and vector waves with polarization effects @xcite , which could be important at bragg resonances .",
    "second , the theory presented here can be used as a stepping stone to improving the understanding of the modulational instabilities in general wave ensembles .",
