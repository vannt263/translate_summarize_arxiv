    "quantum repeaters have shown great promise for creating entangled states over long distances , which is essential for many quantum processing tasks  @xcite .",
    "the repeaters consist of a 1d network of nodes linked by entangled states . by using local operations and classical communication ( locc ) an entangled state",
    "is generated between distant nodes , with the required number of initial entangled states between each node scaling logarithmically with the states separation distance  @xcite .",
    "once created the entangled state can be used for a range of tasks including quantum cryptography  @xcite , distributed quantum computing  @xcite and quantum teleportation  @xcite .",
    "the goal of these protocols is to generate a highly entangled state between two distant nodes and typically one uses the states fidelity , i.e. overlap with a singlet , as a measure of success in achieving this .",
    "however , the one dimensional nature of quantum repeaters means that their application in higher dimensional networks will not take advantage of the higher connectivity . by creating protocols for these higher dimensional networks the required amount of initial entanglement between the nodes can be reduced .",
    "this was first discussed for pure state networks and involved the use of ` entanglement percolation '  @xcite .",
    "the procedure uses the ` procrustean method ' to transform each pure state into a maximally entangled singlet with a finite probability  @xcite .",
    "when this probability exceeds a geometry dependent threshold an infinite cluster is formed of linked nodes .",
    "any two nodes in the cluster can then be transformed into a singlet using the process of entanglement swapping  @xcite .",
    "a singlet is generated between nodes with a probability that is independent of their separation .",
    "in particular , the required number of entangled states between each node does not change with the separation , in contrast to quantum repeaters .",
    "unfortunately , in reality every state will experience noise that causes it to lose its purity and become mixed . therefore extending these ideas to mixed states",
    "is of vital importance for applications . in previous work",
    "we have extended entanglement percolation to networks that initially consist of a particular type of mixed state  @xcite , that can occur when channels are subject to amplitude damping , and we have shown that these are the only two - qubit states that allow perfect singlets to be created .",
    "other schemes have also been shown to generate highly entangled states from a regular 2d square network made of ` binary states '  @xcite . here ,",
    "if the amount of entanglement in the binary states exceeds a threshold , the network is transformed into an entangled state that can stretch over an arbitrary distance , while maintaining a non - maximal but constant entanglement .",
    "our previous protocol  @xcite , as well as the scheme described in ref .",
    "@xcite , requires states of rank two , or less , for long distance entanglement generation using constant resources .",
    "so far no protocol has been able to transform a 2d network of full rank states into a highly entangled two qubit state with no dependence on the qubit separation , although this is possible in infinite 3d networks  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend on these ideas to obtain a ` global error correction ' procedure that can be applied to quantum networks that have arbitrary geometry and are composed of binary states . by combining it with quantum state percolation",
    "we will show that entanglement can be efficiently generated over long distances by using a constant number of _ rank three _ states between each node .",
    "the final fidelity is independent of the distance .",
    "pure states can also be used by the global error correction and entanglement percolation protocols .",
    "these can again be combined to create a range of altered schemes that allow for a continuous transition from a pure state global error correction method to entanglement percolation .",
    "we find that global error correction allows any two chosen nodes in the network to be linked by an entangled state , but this is at the expense of the state s fidelity .",
    "entanglement percolation only allows two nodes from a known subset to be to be connected , but this is via a perfect singlet .",
    "if the criteria for entanglement percolation are not satisfied we have to use a specific combined scheme to create states of maximal fidelity and the choice of this scheme is dependent on the initial states in the network .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we define the network and develop a generalized form of global error correction .",
    "this scheme works on binary states and in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we give a way of generating these binary states from rank three states .",
    "these capabilities are then combined to enable long distance entanglement distribution with rank three states .",
    "requirements for the scheme are calculated and compared with numerical results . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] the schemes will be altered to work on pure states and this allows comparisons to be made between the protocols .",
    "finally we conclude in sec .",
    "a quantum network is constructed by sharing two - qubit entangled states between locations that we call ` nodes ' .",
    "all quantum operations must be local to these nodes but classical communication is allowed between them .",
    "the shared two - qubit states are referred to as ` edges ' and all of the edges between two nodes constitute a ` bond ' ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "ideally each edge will be a maximally entangled singlet , however due to decoherence this situation is unrealistic and we must have a method to cope with errors . in this section",
    "we will devise a global error correction method that performs local measurements and , by combining the results , information is obtained on the error locations .",
    "this information does not allow us to exactly locate the errors but , as we will see , does allow the errors to be subdued so entanglement can be created between distant nodes .",
    "note that throughout we assume the measurements and operations act perfectly .",
    "we will consider the entire network as a mixture of pure states and analyze the protocol acting on each of these using the stabilizer formalism  @xcite . from these results",
    "we can then determine the mixed state produced .",
    "to begin we construct the network s initial state using the states of individual edges .",
    "each of these initial two - qubit edge states can be transformed into a probabilistic mixture of bell states  @xcite , via locc .",
    "this allows us to assume that each edge is in one of the four bell states given by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 . a stabilizer generated by @xmath2",
    "can then describe each bell state and we label the probability of that state as @xmath3 . for a network that contains @xmath4 of these identical edges , and @xmath5 qubits , the whole state will have the form @xmath6 where each edge , @xmath7 , has parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the summations are over all values that these can take and give a mixture of pure states @xmath10 that occur with probability @xmath11 the error model we consider has independent bit - flip and phase - flip errors . for this case the pure states that contribute to the mixture can be thought of as networks of error free singlet states , @xmath12 , on which errors randomly occur .",
    "a bit - flip error that causes @xmath13 occurs with probability @xmath14 .",
    "similarly , phase - flip errors cause @xmath15 and have a probability of @xmath16 .",
    "this situation is equivalent to having edges with the values @xmath17 and @xmath18 and it simplifies the probability of each state @xmath19 to become @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 giving the number of bit - flip and phase - flip errors on the state , respectively , @xmath23 now we apply the global error correction procedure to one of these pure states .",
    "each of which can be described using a stabilizer that is formed by the union of bell state stabilizers .",
    "the procedure extracts information by performing @xmath24 measurements locally on nodes along a closed path of edges , as illustrated in fig .",
    "such paths are referred to as ` loops ' and contain edges from the set @xmath25 , where the @xmath26 give the index of each of the @xmath27 edges forming the loop .",
    "these measurements take @xmath28 and @xmath29 as possible values .",
    "the product of the measurement results around a loop is labelled @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath31 gives the bit - flip error parity around the loop , @xmath32 .",
    "each value of @xmath31 gives us information on the errors that we can then use .",
    "as the measurements are made the stabilizer follows the rules given in ref .  @xcite . after each measurement the stabilizer generator is manipulated so that at most one element anti - commutes with the measurement operator and the measurement operator , multiplied by the outcome , is then substituted in place of the anti - commuting element .",
    "if the operator does not anti - commute with any elements in the stabilizer then nothing is changed .     from the ensemble given by eq .",
    "each node ( white circles ) contains qubits ( black dots ) that are part of two qubit entangled states ( thin lines ) and edges are located in bonds ( thick grey lines ) . for @xmath33",
    "the edge line is solid and if @xmath34 it is dashed .",
    "@xmath35 measurement operations are carried out within each node ( black ovals ) around one plaquette . by doing this a value of @xmath31",
    "can be associated with each plaquette .",
    "the dual network ( red dashed lines ) is shown with these values contained within each dual node ( red circle ) .",
    "the dual vertex representing the exterior is represented by a dashed box.,width=226 ]     measurement outcomes are displayed inside boxes , with ` @xmath36 ' referring to a @xmath37 eigenstate . around each plaquette",
    "the values of @xmath31 are then calculated and shown on the dual network nodes ( red outlined circles linked by dotted lines ) .",
    "values of @xmath29 are defects and are matched together along a path ( blue arrows ) .",
    "b ) edge errors are assumed to lie across the matching path and x gates are applied to one qubit within each of these edges ( black arrows ) .",
    "this ` flips ' ( @xmath38 ) some of the local measurement outcomes .",
    "each qubit can then be put into two groups ( labelled ` 0 ' and ` 1 ' ) using the measurement outcomes ( ` - ' means the groups need to be different for the two qubits ) and qubits that are in a network edge get put in the same group . to assign the values we pick an initial qubit and value at random and then assign values in all remaining qubits .",
    "c ) x gates are applied to one group ( nodes containing white x s ) and for each pure ensemble state a ghz state is created with patches ( shaded red area ) of bit - flip errors .",
    "these occur where the actual edge error path differed from the assumed path .",
    ", width=188 ]    we obtain the measurement outcomes , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , for the operator @xmath35 between every pairing of qubits in each node .",
    "by making these measurements we can calculate @xmath41 for all of the smallest possible loops in the network , which we refer to as plaquettes , and can then deduce @xmath31 for any loop .",
    "we do not need to perform the actual measurement between every qubit pair in a node because some of the @xmath35 operators will be products of previously measured @xmath35 operators . from the state",
    "@xmath42 these measurements result in a state given by a stabilizer that has generators @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) for every edge , @xmath7 , and operators @xmath45 for every measurement @xmath46 .    all of the plaquettes in the network",
    "can then be assigned their values of @xmath31 .",
    "values of one can be considered as defects on nodes in the dual network ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "these defects occur in pairs . a chain of errors , @xmath47 , on the quantum network s edges separate the dual node defects in each pair ( see fig.[fig3]a ) .",
    "these error affected edges must cross a path of dual network edges that connect the two defects .",
    "hence , we can obtain information on the location of bit - flip errors by pairing the defects , in a matching problem .",
    "we assume that the length of the paths is minimal , since longer paths require more errors and this is unlikely when @xmath14 is small .",
    "this gives us a minimum weight matching problem to be solved @xcite in an analogous way to the correction methods used in surface codes @xcite . by doing",
    "so we have found the most likely defect pairs to be linked by a path of errors .",
    "the actual path is assumed to be the one of shortest distance , i.e. smallest number of edges , linking the defects on the dual network ( see fig.[fig3]a ) .",
    "sometimes more than one such path exists and we would wish to minimize the number of nodes between the true path and the assumed path . this can be easily done on regular networks , by using paths that approximately follow straight lines , but for simplicity in the general case it is sufficient to choose one of the shortest paths at random .",
    "one qubit in each network edge that lies along the assumed paths is then acted on with a x gate .",
    "we can actually avoid performing these x gates until the very end when we may have fewer qubits to apply gates on . here",
    "we include the gates at this stage for clarity .",
    "when these gates are applied to a qubit we also change the value of @xmath48 to @xmath49 for each measurement pairing that includes those qubits ( see fig.[fig3]b ) .",
    "this gives @xmath50 for an even number of times around every loop and by acting around every loop with @xmath51 gates we can force @xmath52 for every local qubit pairing .",
    "a procedure to accomplish this task is given in fig.[fig3](b - c ) .",
    "once this is done the resulting stabilizer will have generators @xmath53 , @xmath54 for every edge , @xmath7 , and @xmath35 from every local pairing of qubits .",
    "the @xmath55 values have been changed to @xmath56 after performing the @xmath51 gates .",
    "these @xmath56 values are unknown , however all of the dual edges that cross edges with @xmath57 must form loops on the dual network .",
    "this stabilizer describes a pure ghz state that has had @xmath22 z operators acting on it and x operators acting on all the qubits within some nodes .",
    "these affected nodes are within loops on the dual network and appear as patches ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the x gates that remain when the procedure is run on an initial configuration @xmath58 are described by an operator @xmath59 , that applies x gates on the qubits that lie within patches .",
    "the whole procedure will result in a mixture of these pure states , @xmath60 where @xmath61 acts on an arbitrary qubit and @xmath62 is the probability of the initial error configuration being @xmath58 given the results of the measurements .",
    "larger patches require more errors and are less likely to occur .",
    "hence , for low values of @xmath14 the most probable case is that finite sized patches , containing a small number of nodes , occur randomly .",
    "we quantify the probability of a random node existing in a patch as @xmath63 , which has the same value throughout the network .",
    "for larger values of @xmath14 the likely number of errors increases so that it becomes impossible to match the defects up correctly and accurately guess the paths . within infinite networks there",
    "exists a critical value of @xmath14 below which patches almost certainly exist and long distance entanglement can be generated . above the critical value this is not possible and @xmath64 for the most likely pure states .",

    "the edge errors causing these plaquette errors are shown by thick blue lines .",
    "the error syndromes are matched together ( black arrows ) and this can be used to give the most likely edge error locations for the recorded measurement syndrome .",
    "the grey areas between the assumed error locations and actual edge errors identifies groups of nodes . for this particular pure state in the ensemble we will obtain a ghz state with x errors present on the qubits within these nodes . in practise",
    "we do not know what the initial state was and hence do not know the location and size of the grey patches , but for the regions to become larger more errors are required and hence are less likely.,width=302 ]    when we are highly likely to form patches the resulting mixed state can be cut back to an impure ghz state , with any number of qubits up to @xmath66 , by removing qubits with x measurements and , depending on their outcomes , applying a correcting z operation on one of the qubits to be kept .",
    "the final fidelity , i.e. overlap with a pure ghz state , is dependent on @xmath14 and decreases for more qubits in the resulting state .",
    "it is however still independent of the distance between the qubits . in particular",
    ", we can remove all of the qubits except two leaving a two - qubit entangled state spread between two nodes .",
    "for each pure state contributing to the mixture in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) after removing the qubits we obtain an ideal singlet when the remaining qubits are either both in an error affected patch or outside of them ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the pure state @xmath19 is transformed to the state @xmath67 , that has the form @xmath68 and the final mixed state is given by the weighted sum of these , @xmath69    since @xmath63 is independent of the state separation we see that as long as there are no phase errors present , i.e. @xmath70 , the state produced has a fidelity that is independent of the node separation .",
    "these states that do not experience phase errors are called binary states  @xcite .",
    "our global error correction procedure is a generalization of the one given in @xcite but does not involve teleporting qubits and can be easily applied to any network geometry .",
    "later we will see that we can randomly transform states into binary states , obtaining them on random bonds but also destroying all of the entanglement in the remaining bonds .",
    "our scheme can still be applied in these situations and in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] it has been applied on a contributing term in the largest cluster of a square network that was missing such bonds .",
    "we will discuss this in more detail in the next section ( see sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in regular networks with all bonds intact we performed simulations to reveal the critical threshold of @xmath14 below which long distance entanglement distribution is always possible .",
    "this was done for both square and triangular networks ( see fig .  [ fig1](b - c ) ) . in both cases",
    "we see the final states fidelity decrease suddenly after critical @xmath14 values ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "these transitions become more prominent for larger networks and later we will attach values to the thresholds .     and then x errors introduced with a probability of @xmath71 .",
    "we apply our global error correction procedure and eventually this generates a ghz state with patches of nodes that exhibit unwanted , extra bit - flips ( red , filled circles ) .",
    "if we try to link a node from within a patch to outside of them ( dashed line ) the final state two - qubit state exhibits a bit - flip error .",
    "examples are also given of qubit pairings that would not exhibit errors ( bold black lines ) .",

    "we can use error correction codes to subdue the phase - flip errors  @xcite .",
    "all of the qubits are then replaced with encoded qubits and all operations are replaced with their encoded versions .",
    "this technique was looked at in @xcite for a square network using a majority voting css code . in this case for bonds containing @xmath72 edges the phase error probability on each encoded edge can be suppressed to @xmath73 . to maintain a constant phase error probability on the final state",
    "the number of edges in each bond only needs to increase logarithmically with the size of the network .",
    "unfortunately , this operation also increases the chance of a bit flip on the encoded edge to @xmath74 , which means there is a point where the chance of a bit - flip exceeds the network s critical value , patches are no longer small and the procedure fails .",
    "when @xmath14 is small this still enables the @xmath16 error probability to be substantially reduced . for rank two , binary states , the number of edges required in each bond does not need to scale with distance and yet for rank four states there is a logarithmic scaling . in the following we are interested in extending the constant scaling with states that are of rank three .",
    "using the global error correction procedure we can cause the edge errors in every pure state in an ensemble to condense into patches on a large ghz state in such a way that a highly entangled two - qubit state can be generated between two distant nodes .",
    "this requires the initial network nodes to be linked by sufficiently entangled binary states .",
    "however , in the following we will show that such states can be probabilistically generated from a larger class of rank three states using locc .",
    "this widens the class of states in a 2d network that allow for long distance entanglement distribution .",
    "it is impossible for a rank two , binary state to be created using anything other than states that are rank three or less .",
    "we give a short proof of this fact in appendix  [ app1 ] .",
    "if we have two rank three states that can be probabilistically transformed by locc into states of the form @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 , then they can be probabilistically distilled into a binary state @xmath78 where @xmath79 the states given by eq .",

    "having two of these states the transformation to a binary state is done by performing a protocol discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was called a ` pure state conversion measurement ' ( pcm ) , followed by local hadamard operations .",
    "the pcm involves performing two c - not gates locally , with one entangled state s qubits acting as the target qubits .",

    "the result is then communicated to the other qubit where a unitary is performed .",
    "this transformation operation and probability come from ` majorization ' results  @xcite .",
    "these states can then be ` twirled '  @xcite into binary states , with @xmath119 .",
    "these actions probabilistically generate binary states at random bonds , allowing global error correction to be applied .",
    "the value of @xmath88 can be adjusted between @xmath120 and @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath88 is larger than the percolation threshold then an infinite cluster , of binary states @xmath121 , is formed and a node is a member of this cluster with probability @xmath122 .",
    "any two nodes in the cluster can then be linked by global error correction .",
    "two nodes are in the cluster with a probability of @xmath123 and they can be turned into a binary state that has fidelity @xmath112 after global error correction . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the paths of @xmath124 are shown for different values of @xmath115 as a dashed line . each point on these lines correspond to a binary state that can be obtained from the initial pure state .",
    "the relationship between the available fidelities , @xmath112 , and fraction of nodes in the cluster is given in fig .",
    "each line relates to a different initial pure state . for each dashed line representing an initial state in fig .",

    "if we are required to generate long distance entangled states with the highest possible amount of entanglement then , given that the threshold for entanglement percolation is satisfied , the preferred method is to randomly obtain perfect singlets and then use entanglement swapping .",
    "this generates a perfect singlet , however in doing so we reduce the number of nodes that are available to be linked . when the threshold is not satisfied we must probabilistically transform the initial states to binary states with the largest @xmath125 that still lie within the critical region . by doing this one highly entangled state",
    "is created over a long distance .",
    "note that the initial state of the edges needs to be known in order to decide on the state to percolate .",
    "we are unable to choose the nodes before running the protocol , but we still know which nodes are linked at the end .",
    "if we are required to link two particular nodes , that have been chosen before the protocol is run , we must maximize @xmath126 and this is achieved by using global error correction .",
    "the choice between maximizing the fidelity or @xmath126 is dependent on the intended use for the entangled state .",
    "if one entangled state between any two nodes in a set is sufficient it may be beneficial to maximize @xmath126 . in order to judge the schemes a figure of merit can be constructed from @xmath126 and the fidelity .",
    "this can then be maximized to reveal the preferred scheme .",
    "for example a suitable figure of merit in the case where two specific nodes need to be entangled would be @xmath127 and this is maximized for global error correction .    ) .",
    "for each of these the largest cluster contains a different proportion @xmath128 of total nodes and any two of these can be linked using global error correction to leave a two qubit entangled state that has fidelity @xmath112 .",
    "the different values of @xmath112 and @xmath126 are given for each initial pure state .",
    "shown are plots corresponding to eleven initial pure states with @xmath129 ( top to bottom).,width=302 ]",
    "previously , entangled states could only be generated over an arbitrarily long distance from rank two states , or less , in regular 2d networks@xcite .",
    "here we have devised a global error correction scheme that enables a highly entangled state to be generated over an arbitrary distance .",
    "this procedure can be applied to any network composed of binary states and allows the creation of multi - qubit ghz states . by combining this with entanglement percolation",
    "we have extended this ability to any network and a class of rank three states .",
    "these states would result from a combined amplitude damping and phase error channel . for networks composed of these rank three states it becomes possible to produce highly entangled states over arbitrary distances , with constant resources between the nodes .",
    "although this is still a restricted case it is one step closer towards 2d networks composed of full rank states and allows us to deal with two important kinds of noise .",
    "initially there must be a sufficient amount of entanglement between the nodes for the scheme to succeed and we have provided an entropic estimate for the requirements in percolated networks , based on the estimate in ref .",
    "we have numerically calculated the resulting fidelities and the results agree with the threshold estimate .",
    "the behavior of both entanglement percolation and global error correction was previously investigated separately but here we have provided a method to connect these possibilities and in doing so revealed the preferred methods for different priorities .",
    "it is still an interesting question to ask whether long distance entanglement distribution can exist in a 2d network of werner states even when the gates are assumed to be perfect .",
    "this research was supported by the esf via euroquam ( epsrc grant ep / e041612/1 ) .",
    "binary states can not be generated from two - qubit full rank states and we prove this by contradiction . if there were to exist some local procedure that produced some binary states from a full rank state then , by acting after with local projective measurements on all qubits except those in one binary state , we can easily construct a method to generate a single binary state and pure separable state .",
    "this local procedure can be described by an operator @xmath130 , where @xmath131 and @xmath132 act locally .",
    "the dimension of the entire hilbert space is @xmath133 .",
    "they must also satisfy @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "the initial mixed state is @xmath136 with @xmath137 = 1 and @xmath138 is a complete basis .",
    "the procedure can then convert this initial state into @xmath139 @xmath140 is a pure separable state , @xmath141 is the two - qubit binary state and @xmath142 a non - zero probability .",
    "since the initial state was full rank this property requires @xmath143 to be rank two .",
    "this is only the case when either @xmath131 or @xmath132 have rank one .",
    "any operator , @xmath143 , with this property would not generate an entangled state .",
    "hence , a binary state can not be generated using locc from a full rank state and this includes the case of finite full rank two - qubit states ."
