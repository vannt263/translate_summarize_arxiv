    "a new class of magnetic compounds known as molecular magnets @xcite is attracting much attention .",
    "these compounds can be synthesized as single crystals of identical molecular units , each containing several paramagnetic ions that mutually interact via heisenberg exchange .",
    "the intermolecular magnetic interactions are in the great majority of cases utterly negligible as compared to intramolecular magnetic interactions",
    ". measurements of the magnetic properties therefore reflect those of the common , individual molecular unit .",
    "molecular magnets such as \\{mn@xmath3 } and \\{fe@xmath4 } have been the focal point for intense study of subjects of broad scientific importance , such as quantum tunneling of magnetisation and quantum coherence @xcite . however , it is doubtful @xcite that larger symmetric arrays of paramagnetic ions can be accommodated in such polynuclear coordination complexes utilizing simple organic bridging ligands .",
    "very recently the first examples of a new paradigm of molecular magnets , based on so - called keplerate structures , have been synthesized @xcite , and these offer numerous avenues for obtaining truly giant , highly symmetric arrays of paramagnetic ions .",
    "the archetype of this new class is referred to as \\{mo@xmath0fe@xmath1 } @xcite .",
    "embedded within a ( diamagnetic ) host molecule ( mol . wt .",
    "18,649 ) , 30 fe@xmath2 paramagnetic ions ( spins @xmath5 ) occupy the sites of an icosidodecahedron and interact via isotropic , nearest - neighbour antiferromagnetic exchange .",
    "this keplerate and its interlinked derivatives @xcite pose a major theoretical challenge .",
    "the dimension of the hilbert space for \\{mo@xmath0fe@xmath1 } is a staggering @xmath6 , precluding the calculation of the energy eigenvalues on any computer .    in this letter",
    "we show that despite this immense obstacle the major low - temperature properties of \\{mo@xmath0fe@xmath1 } can be calculated . rather than pursue the futile task of diagonalizing the heisenberg hamiltonian",
    "[ see ( [ e-1 ] ) ] , we adopt an approximate , diagonalizable hamilton operator [ see ( [ e-2 ] ) ] which properly incorporates the generic result that the low - lying magnetic energy levels of a wide class of molecular magnets are arranged as parallel rotational bands .",
    "these rotational bands reflect the underlying sublattice structure of the spin array @xcite that has been found for the corresponding classical system @xcite .",
    "but in contrast to the classical model and approximations like high - temperature series expansions the present approach enables us to access the properties of giant magnetic molecules for very low temperatures .",
    "we are also able to show that the predictions of the classical model extend to temperatures as low as 100  mk with very good accuracy for the special case of \\{mo@xmath0fe@xmath1}. in particular , we present our theoretical predictions for the temperature and field dependence of the magnetisation , and for the resonances of the spin - lattice relaxation rate of \\{mo@xmath0fe@xmath1}. we also show that our experimental findings directly reflect the existence of rotational bands .",
    "the hamiltonian for the isotropic heisenberg model including the interaction with an external magnetic field @xmath7 reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the exchange constant with units of energy , and @xmath10 corresponds to antiferromagnetic coupling , @xmath11 is the spectroscopic splitting factor , and @xmath12 is the bohr magneton .",

    "the sum in runs over all distinct nearest - neighbour pairs @xmath16 of spins of a single molecule at positions @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "since the hamiltonian commutes with the operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 of the total spin , the eigenstates of @xmath21 may be classified using the quantum numbers @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    in order to develop an approximate quantum model of \\{mo@xmath0fe@xmath1 } , we first exploit the fact that the set of minimal energies for each @xmath22 forms a rotational band , @xmath24\\ , s ( s+1 ) + e_a \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this has been noted on several occasions for ring structures with an even number @xmath25 of sites @xcite .",
    "elsewhere we reported that all finite heisenberg systems with isotropic and homogeneous antiferromagnetic exchange ( including rings for both even and odd @xmath25 , tetrahedron , cube , octahedron , icosahedron , triangular prism , and axially truncated icosahedron ) exhibit a rotational band @xcite .",
    "for high - symmetry systems we provided an expression for the classical limit @xmath26 , henceforth denoted by @xmath27 , which yields @xmath28 for rings with even @xmath25 , see also @xcite , and @xmath29 for the icosidodecahedron , cube , and octahedron .",
    "our investigations @xcite have shown that the numerical value of @xmath30 for any finite @xmath15 is always a little larger than @xmath27 .",
    "this difference can be taken as a measure of quantum spin effects ; consistently it is largest for @xmath31 .",
    "the constant offset @xmath32 in ( [ e-4 ] ) is to be selected so that the highest level of the rotational band , which occurs for @xmath33 , agrees with the largest energy eigenvalue of ( [ e-1 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding eigenvector is the ground state eigenvector for the counterpart ferromagnetic system .",
    "thus the largest energy eigenvalue serves as an anchor in all approximations of the rotational band @xcite . summarizing , for the molecular magnet \\{mo@xmath0fe@xmath1 } the lowest rotational band",
    "is given by @xmath34    the rotational band ( [ e-5 ] ) by itself is insufficient for calculating observables at low temperatures ; it is essential to include the other low - lying excitation energies .",
    "this can be achieved via the introduction of an effective hamiltonian whose form is set by incorporating the known symmetry of the spin array ( icosidodecahedron ) , which is similar to that of the triangular lattice . therefore , the low - lying spectrum can be understood as originating from three interacting sublattice spins @xcite .",
    "these findings are supported by the fact that also the exact classical ground state of the icosidodecahedron for @xmath10 is describable in terms of three sublattice spin vectors @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 with @xmath38 , and with relative angles of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "we thus adopt as our effective hamiltonian , replacing the field - free term of ( [ e-1 ] ) , see also @xcite ,",

    "the sublattice spin operators mutually commute and they also commute with @xmath43 .",

    "the lowest rotational band , , arises upon choosing @xmath38 and allowing @xmath22 to extend from 0 to 75 . the next higher rotational band ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ f-1 ] , is obtained for the choice @xmath47 , @xmath48 and its permutations .",

    "this process leads to a sequence of parabolic bands .",
    "this is rather realistic for the second band , and indeed observed in many finite heisenberg systems , compare figs . 1 , 3 , and 4 in @xcite .",
    "the theoretical result for @xmath50 versus @xmath7 at @xmath51  k , as obtained using ( [ e-2 ] ) and a zeeman term , is a staircase with @xmath52 steps of unit height which terminates at the critical field @xmath53  t. the values of @xmath9 and @xmath11 have been determined by high - temperature , low - field magnetic susceptibility measurements @xcite : @xmath54  k , and @xmath55 . for @xmath56",

    "in fact , for @xmath61  mk thermal broadening effects smear out the staircase of the quantum model and , above approximately @xmath62  t , @xmath63 increases linearly with @xmath7 , almost parallel to but somewhat below the classical @xmath51 result .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to put this prediction of staircase - like behavior below 50  mk to a careful experimental test .",

    "increasing from 0 to 60 tesla in approximately 6  ms , we estimate that the effective temperature of the spins was 4  k , even though the nominal cryostat temperature was 0.46  k. nevertheless , the very good agreement between theory and experiment confirms the underlying picture of rotational bands on which the model is based . for a non - parabolic dependence of the energy eigenvalues on @xmath22",
    "the magnetisation curve would show unequal steps at @xmath51 as well as nonlinear behaviour at higher temperatures .",
    "as remarked above , the classical coefficient @xmath65 always underestimates the true coefficient @xmath30 by a few percent @xcite .",
    "of course , there is no simple method for establishing the correct value of @xmath66 , so it is of interest to estimate its value by using the currently available experimental data for @xmath63 versus @xmath7 .",
    "we attempt to improve approximation ( [ e-2 ] ) quantitatively while ensuring that the rotational band structure is not altered .",
    "we adjust @xmath30 so that the resulting magnetisation curve ( thick curve in fig .",
    "[ f-2 ] , r.h.s . ) provides an optimal fit to the measured data .",

    "using ( [ e-3 ] ) we find that @xmath70  t. finally , using this tentative estimate for @xmath66 enables us to predict the ground state energy of \\{mo@xmath0fe@xmath1 } as @xmath71  k. taking into account the error bars of the measured data we estimate that the resulting uncertainty of @xmath66 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is less than 3  % .",
    "we are currently attempting to calculate @xmath66 from first principles using dmrg techniques @xcite .",

    "[ f-3 ] , l.h.s . )",
    "we find good agreement to the experimental data . the seemingly unexciting result , that both the experimental and theoretical magnetisation m are virtually constant over a wide temperature range , actually provides important , indirect confirmation of the existence of a sequence of rotational bands .",
    "this can well be understood with the help of the spectrum of @xmath76 shown in fig .",
    "[ f-3 ]  ( r.h.s . ) for a finite magnetic field .",
    "the levels of the lowest parabola in fig .",
    "[ f-3 ]  ( r.h.s . ) originate from the @xmath77 levels of the lowest rotational band for @xmath78 ( fig .",

    "[ f-3 ]  ( r.h.s . ) originate from the @xmath79 levels of the lowest rotational band as well as the @xmath77 levels of the second rotational band .",

    "therefore these levels are populated symmetrically and this leads to a magnetisation which is nearly temperature independent . a slight temperature dependence for @xmath80  k ( see inset of fig .  [ f-3 ] , l.h.s . ) stems from small differences in the degeneracies of the individual levels as well as from the fact that the approximate spectrum deviates from the exact one for higher excitation energies .",
    "nevertheless , the near constancy of @xmath63 with @xmath81 is therefore also strong evidence that not only the lowest rotational band ( [ e-5 ] ) , but also the second is parabolic , for otherwise the symmetry would be broken and @xmath63 would vary significantly with @xmath81 .",
