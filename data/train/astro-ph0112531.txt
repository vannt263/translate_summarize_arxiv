    "gravitational lensing has proven to be an exceptional tool for studying a diverse set of astrophysical phenomena .",
    "its utility is due , at least in part , to the fact it operates in a number of qualitatively different regimes .",
    "the term strong lensing , or macrolensing , is usually applied when a distant source ( typically cosmological ) is lensed into multiple , resolved images by an intervening mass , such as a foreground cluster or a galaxy .",
    "weak lensing is used to refer to the case when multiple images are not created , and the gravitational field of the intervening matter serves only to slightly distort the image of the source . for most applications of both strong and weak lensing",
    ", the source , lens , and observer can be considered static .",
    "the term microlensing is often used to describe the case when multiple images are created , but are not resolved .",
    "typically the separation of the images created by a gravitational microlens are of order the einstein ring radius , @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the mass of the lens , @xmath2 is defined by , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are the distances between the observer - source , observer - lens , and lens - source , respectively . in cosmological contexts , angular diameter distances should be used . when @xmath7 is less than the resolution , individual images in general can not be distinguished . due to the small scale of @xmath7 , it is typically not a good approximation to assume that the source , lens , and observer are static",
    ". therefore the lensing properties can be expected to change on timescales of order the einstein ring crossing time , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the transverse speed of the lens relative to the observer - source line - of - sight .",
    "the standard observables in gravitational microlensing are therefore the time rate of change of the total magnification and center - of - light ( centroid ) of all the microimages .",
    "there are two different regimes where microlensing has been discussed : quasar microlensing @xcite and microlensing in the local group @xcite .    in the local group ,",
    "gravitational microlensing occurs whenever a massive , compact object passes close to our line of sight to a more distant star .",
    "microlensing was originally suggested as a method to detect baryonic dark matter in the halo of our galaxy @xcite , but has been developed and applied as an important tool in studying a number of astrophysical topics , including the stellar mass function @xcite , extrasolar planets @xcite , stellar atmospheres @xcite , and stellar multiplicity @xcite .",
    "the only microlensing effect currently observable is the magnification of the background source as function of time .",
    "this is because , for typical distances in the local group , the angular einstein ring radius is @xmath10 and therefore too small to be resolved with current instruments .",
    "the timescale for a microlensing event is @xmath11 . in general",
    ", it is much easier to determine the center - of - light of an image than it is to resolve it .",
    "thus future interferometers , such as the _ space interferometry mission ( sim ) _ , although still not able to resolve separations of @xmath12 , should be able to measure the centroid of all the images to much better than this , perhaps even down to @xmath13 in the case of _",
    "sim_. such accuracy is sufficient to easily detect the motion of the centroid of the images created in a microlensing event , which is also of order @xmath7 .",
    "this regime is typically referred to as astrometric microlensing , as opposed to photometric microlensing when only the total magnification is observable .",
    "astrometric microlensing has a number of important applications . by combining ground - based photometry of microlensing events with photometry and astrometry from an astrometric satellite on an earth - like orbit , the masses of microlenses",
    "can routinely be measured @xcite , allowing for the determination of the compact object mass function in the bulge , including stellar remnants @xcite .",
    "astrometric information alone allows for the precise ( few % ) measurement of the masses of nearby stars @xcite . finally , for a subset of events , it will be possible to obtain precision measurements of angular diameters of stars in the galactic bulge using astrometric information @xcite .",
    "binary microlenses have proven to be enormously useful in photometric microlensing studies .",
    "this is primarily because binary lenses exhibit caustics : closed curves on which the mapping from the lens plane to light source plane becomes critical , and the point - source magnification becomes formally infinite .",
    "regions near caustics exhibit large , rapidly changing ( with respect to source position ) magnification , and are therefore useful not only for providing a large source flux , but also high angular resolution .",
    "however , binary lenses have also proven to be difficult to study both theoretically and observationally .",
    "this is partially because the lens equation , which describes the mapping from the lens plane to the light source plane , is equivalent to a fifth - order complex polynomial in the source position @xcite , and therefore is not analytically solvable in general .",
    "furthermore , care must be taken when considering finite source effects near caustics due to the divergent magnification .",
    "however , considerable progress can be made when one realizes that the smooth arcs ( away from cusps ) of caustics that arise in nearly equal - mass binary lenses are well approximated as simple linear fold catastrophes , which have generic , simple , and most importantly , _",
    "analytic _ behavior .",
    "thus the caustics of binary lenses can be analyzed analytically or semi - analytically without reference to the global ( and non - analytic ) topology of the general binary lens .",
    "in particular , a simple equation for the magnification of a source near a fold exists @xcite , which has been used in a number of important applications including binary - lens fitting @xcite , stellar atmospheres @xcite , and caustic - crossing predictions @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the astrometric behavior of single lenses , which is analytic and has been quite well studied @xcite , there have been only a few preliminary studies of the astrometric properties of binary gravitational lenses @xcite .",
    "it is known that astrometric binary - lens curves exhibit complex behavior , including instantaneous @xmath14 jumps in the image centroid trajectory that occur when a point source crosses a binary - lens caustic and two highly - magnified images appear in a position unrelated to the position of the centroid of the other three binary - lens images .",
    "the generic behavior of these centroid jumps , or how they are altered by finite source effects , is not understood . as is the case for photometric microlensing",
    ", the astrometric behavior of binary lenses will likely prove quite useful for several applications .",
    "the usefulness of binary lenses is primarily related to the complex image centroid trajectories and the large centroid jumps .",
    "although , in general , these properties do not allow one to measure any additional parameters over the single lens case ; they do allow one to measure these parameters much more easily . in particular ,",
    "@xcite have shown that lens mass measurements can be made to a given accuracy with 1 - 3 orders of magnitude fewer photons with caustic - crossing binary - lens events than with single lens events , thus greatly reducing the resources required to achieve one of the primary proposed science goals of astrometric microlensing .",
    "caustic crossing binary - lens events are also enormously useful for measuring the angular radii of microlensing source stars in the bulge , for two reasons .",
    "first , the expected ratio of binary - to - single lens events for which the source star is resolved is a factor of @xmath15 for giant sources and @xmath16 for main sequence sources .",
    "furthermore , the large and complex centroid shifts expected for caustic - crossing binary - lens events makes the requisite astrometric measurements easier .",
    "@xcite have shown that , by combining accurate ground - based photometry with a handful of precise astrometric measurements , caustic - crossing binary - lens events should yield @xmath17 stellar radius measurements with reasonable expenditure of resources .",
    "thus , given the importance of caustic crossing binary - lens events , an analytic study of the generic behavior of astrometric microlensing near folds would prove quite useful .    in quasar microlensing , the separate macroimages of a quasar that is multiply - imaged by a intervening galaxy or cluster also feel the combined , non - linear effect of individual point masses ( i.e. stars ) in the macrolensing object that are near the macroimage position .",
    "the individual macroimages are in fact composed of many , unresolved microimages with separations of order the einstein radius of a @xmath18 object at cosmological distances , @xmath19 .",
    "the typical timescale for the source to cross an angle of @xmath7 is @xmath20 ; however microlensing light curves should show structure on much smaller timescales due to the combined effects of many individual microlenses .",
    "since it was first discussed by @xcite , cosmological microlensing has been studied theoretically by numerous authors ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and detected in at least two systems ( q2237 + 0305 , @xcite , b1600 + 434 , @xcite ) .",
    "observations have been used to place constraints on , e.g. ,  the size of the emitting region of quasars @xcite and the mass function of microlenses @xcite .",
    "quasar microlensing differs markedly from microlensing in the local group in that the surface mass density in units of the critical density for lensing ( the `` optical depth '' ) is of order unity , rather than @xmath21 for the local group . in the high optical depth regime",
    "the lensing effects of the individual microlenses add nonlinearly , resulting in a complex caustic network . due to this nonlinear behavior and",
    "the large number of lenses typically involved , calculation of the observable properties of such a lensing system is difficult and time consuming .",
    "although in the high optical depth regime the caustics often exhibit considerably more complicated global behavior than the caustics of binary lenses in the local group , it is still the case that the smooth arcs ( away from cusps ) of the caustics are locally well - approximated by generic fold catastrophes",
    ". this fact , combined with a simple formula for the magnification near folds , has been exploited by numerous authors to quickly and efficiently calculate various observable properties of quasar microlensing @xcite .",
    "the observable effects of quasar microlensing have been limited to the relative magnifications of the various macroimages as a function of time . as with local group microlensing",
    ", astrometric effects should also be present .",
    "the centroid of the individual macroimages should vary as a function of time , particularly when new images are created or destroyed when the source crosses a caustic .",
    "this effect has been studied by @xcite and @xcite . in particular ,",
    "@xcite predict that magnitude of the centroid shift for the q2237 + 0305 system ( apparent magnitude @xmath22 ) can be as large as @xmath23 , and thus potentially observable with _ sim_. they also note that the magnitude of the centroid shift is often correlated with the magnitude of the change in total magnification .",
    "the analytic results presented in this paper may prove useful for this application .",
    "here we study the generic , local behavior of microlensing near fold catastrophes . in ",
    "2 we present an analytic study of the photometric and astrometric behavior near folds .",
    "we begin with the equations that describe the mapping near a fold caustic in  2.1 , and use these to derive the behavior of a point source near a fold .",
    "we extend this analysis to finite sources in  2.2 , and limb - darkened sources in  2.3 . in  2.4 we show how and when our generic parabolic fold form reduces to the more familiar linear caustic . in ",
    "2.5 we use our analytic results to derive some generic results about the astrometric behavior near folds .",
    "we verify the applicability of our results in  3 by numerically calculating the photometric and astrometric behavior of one well - observed binary - lens event .",
    "we find excellent agreement with our analytic formulae .",
    "finally , we summarize and conclude in  4 .    our goal is to provide a thorough , comprehensive study of gravitational microlensing near fold caustics .",
    "although our study is interesting in its own right , the primary utility of the results presented here is their potential application to the topics mentioned in the previous paragraphs .",
    "a prescription for how specifically our results can be applied to these topics is beyond the scope of this paper , but we will make general comments along these lines over the course of the paper , and more specific comments in  2.5 .",
    "we are currently preparing a complementary , similarly detailed study of microlensing near cusps .",
    "combined with this study , we will have a reasonably thorough and complete understanding of the local behavior of microlensing observables near all stable gravitational lensing singularities .",
    "we note that some of the results derived here , particularly the results on the photometric behavior near folds , have been presented elsewhere ( see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) . we include those results here for the sake of completeness .",
    "for a general gravitational lens , the lensed images @xmath24 of a source @xmath25 , are given by the solutions of the lens equation , which is the mapping @xmath26 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the projected newtonian potential of the lens , @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the surface density of the lens , and @xmath33 is the critical surface density for lensing .",
    "note that @xmath34 .",

    "the individual images are by definition unresolved , and thus it is useful to define the total magnification @xmath46 where the sum is over all images . the center - of - light , or centroid @xmath47 of the images is simply the magnification weighted sum of the image positions , @xmath48 for simplicity , we will focus primarily on the quantity @xmath49 .",
    "however , it is important to note that , in general , centroid measurements will be made with respect to the unlensed source position , thus the observable is @xmath50 also , while the angular variables we will be working with will be in units of @xmath7 , the astrometric observables are in physical units , such as arcseconds . to convert to observable quantities , all angular quantities must be multiplied by @xmath7 .",
    "for example , the observable centroid shift is given by @xmath51 .",
    "we now derive the generic behavior of the photometric and astrometric properties of gravitational lensing near folds .",
    "we will present our derivations in some detail , in order to document the approximations and simplifying assumptions that are implicit in the final analytic expressions . in figure 1",
    ", we provide an illustrative example of the basic properties of lensing near a fold .",
    "we will refer to this figure repeatedly during the course of the derivations .",
    "suppose that the lensing map @xmath39 sends the origin to itself ( which can always be accomplished by appropriate translations ) and a fold caustic curve passes through the origin .",
    "by taylor expanding the gravitational potential @xmath29 about the origin , one can find an orthogonal change of coordinates that is the same in the lens and light source planes such that the lensing map @xmath39 can be approximated by the following mapping in a neighborhood of the origin ( petters , levine , & wambsganss 2001 , pp .",

    "we find that the caustic is locally a parabola . on one side of the parabola , the fold lenses a nearby source into two images ; on the other side of the parabola , there are no images .",
    "we derive the image positions and magnifications as a function of the position of the source .",
    "we find that the magnifications of the two images are equal , and recover the well - known result that the magnification is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance to the caustic .",
    "we show how this holds for parabolic caustics ( as well as linear caustics ) , provided that the ` vertical ' distance from the caustic is used .    assuming a rectilinear source trajectory , and allowing for the existence of slowly- and smoothly - varying images not associated with the fold caustic , we derive analytic expressions for the total magnification and image centroid ( center - of - light ) as a function of time .",

    "caustics are ubiquitous in gravitational lenses , and the most common type of caustic is the fold .",
    "caustics play an especially important role in microlensing , as the rapid time variability of the total image magnification allows the possibility of detailed studies of the source and lens . in the future",
