    "the analysis of real lisa data will necessarily involve a detailed modeling of instrument response and noise ; for the purposes of the mldcs , it is desirable to decouple this aspect from the inherent complexity of gw analysis , by distilling the lisa measurements into a standard idealized model . thus , the mldc task force has developed a set of _ pseudo - lisa _ assumptions and conventions , which we lay out in this section ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . both of the lisa response simulators used in challenge 1 ( the lisa simulator @xcite and synthetic lisa @xcite ) comply with these assumptions , and adhere to these conventions . in later challenges , as the craft of lisa data - analysis matures , so will the pseudo - lisa model , becoming increasingly realistic .",
    "the pseudo - lisa orbits are obtained by truncating exact keplerian orbits for a small mass orbiting the sun to first order in the eccentricity ( see the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in solar - system barycentric ( ssb ) coordinates ( with the @xmath0 axis aligned with the vernal point ) , we set @xmath1 where @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is the relative orbital phase of each spacecraft , @xmath4 au is the semi - major axis of the guiding center , and @xmath5 is its orbital phase . in this approximation , the spacecraft form a rigid equilateral triangle with side length @xmath6 km for @xmath7 .",
    "( in fact , the lisa simulator and synthetic lisa implement @xmath8-accurate orbits , but the additional terms make very little difference to the instrument response . )    the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( ` initialposition ` and ` initialrotation ` in lisaxml , see sec .  [ sec : lisaxml ] ) set the initial location and orientation of the lisa constellation ; in challenge 1 , @xmath11",
    ". this choice places lisa at the vernal point , with spacecraft 1 directly below the guiding center in the southern ecliptic hemisphere .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for expressions to convert to other lisa orbit specifications .",
    "all times are measured by an ideal clock at the ssb .",
    "the basic ( individual - link ) lisa response to gws is taken to be the _ phase response _",
    "@xmath12 used in the lisa simulator and discussed in sec .",
    "ii of ref .",
    "@xcite , or the _ fractional frequency response _ @xmath13 used in synthetic lisa and discussed in sec .",
    "ii b of ref .",
    "( see the tdi rosetta stone @xcite for translations between index notations . ) the phase and fractional - frequency formalisms are equivalent , and are related by a simple time integration .",
    "the former has the advantage of representing more closely the actual output of the lisa phasemeters ; the latter of being directly proportional to ( differences of ) the gravitational strains at the spacecraft .",
    "( in fact the _ lisa simulator",
    "_ produces _ equivalent - strain _ data , with a nominal length of @xmath14 m. to convert equivalent strain to fractional frequency , differentiate and multiply by @xmath15 . )",
    "lisa will employ time - delay interferometry ( tdi ; see refs .",
    "@xcite ) to cancel the otherwise overwhelming laser phase noise .",
    "in essence , tdi observables are constructed from time - delayed linear combinations of individual - link measurements , and they represent _ synthesized _ interferometers where laser phase fluctuations move in closed paths across the lisa arms .",
    "more complicated paths are required to deal with the variations of the armlengths due to the finer details of the lisa orbits , giving rise to the three tdi `` generations . ''",
    "it is expected that high - level lisa data - analysis tasks ( such as those targeted in the challenges ) will be performed directly on tdi observables , and not on the underlying phase measurements .",
    "thus , for the initial challenges we elect to represent the lisa output as _ tdi 1.5 _ observables @xcite , and in particular as the _ unequal - arm michelson _ observables @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 defined in refs .",
    "@xcite . strictly speaking",
    ", tdi 2.0 would be required to cancel laser noise completely in a rotating and flexing lisa array such as our pseudo - lisa ; however , the upgrade from tdi 1.5 to 2.0 changes little in the response to gw signals , but it requires more careful numerical treatments and adds to the complexity of analysis codes .",
    "thus , the initial challenge data sets contain tdi 1.5 observables _ without _ laser noise .",
    "the model of lisa instrument noise adopted in challenge 1 includes only contributions from optical noise ( assumed white in phase , with one - sided spectral density @xmath19 ) , and from acceleration noise ( assumed white in acceleration , but increasing as @xmath20 below @xmath21 hz , with one - sided spectral density @xmath22^{1/2}\\ , \\mathrm{m}\\ , \\mathrm{s}^{-2}\\ , \\mathrm{hz}^{-1/2}$ ] ) , but not from laser phase noise , as discussed above .",
    "the six optical noises and six acceleration noises ( for the two optical benches on each spacecraft ) are modeled as independent gaussian random processes , and are realized in practice with sequences of pseudo - random numbers .",
    "specifically , synthetic lisa generates independent gaussian deviates ( i.e. , white noise ) in the time domain , and then filters them digitally to obtain the desired spectral shape ; the lisa simulator generates independent gaussian deviates in the frequency domain , multiplies them by @xmath23 , and ffts to the time domain .",
    "another source of complexity that we wish to exclude from the initial challenges is the uncertainty about the true shape of the gravitational waveforms that nature will provide to lisa .",
    "however , we can already begin prepare for their detection and analysis , while waiting for theory to provide more and more accurate models , by working with fully known waveforms of comparable structure and increasing complexity .",
    "this section describes the standard simplified waveforms used in challenge 1 to embody the signals emitted by the three kinds of gw sources under consideration : galactic binaries , massive black - hole binaries , and extreme  mass - ratio inspirals .",
    "a special care was devoted to choosing standard source parametrizations that could be used by mldc participants to report their analysis results and compare them easily .",
    ".common source parameters .",
    "note that in the initial challenges we do not deal explicitly with the redshifting of sources at cosmological distances ; thus , @xmath24 is a _ luminosity _ distance , and the masses and frequencies of tables [ tab : bbh ] are those measured at the ssb , which are red / blue - shifted by factors @xmath25 w.r.t . to those measured locally near the sources.[tab : common ] [ cols= \" < ,",

    "all mldc training and challenge data sets are distributed from the mldc website @xcite in a standard file format , developed by the mldc task force with the goal of facilitating the use of the data sets on different computing platforms , and of enabling their identification , perusal , tracking , and archival .",
    "the mldc file format is also used internally by the mldc task force within the workflow that leads from the choice of random source parameters to the generation of tdi data sets .        * a _ prolog _ including file metadata such as author , generation date ,",
    "the name and version of the computer code used to create the data , and any other relevant comments . *",
    "a _ lisa data _ section describing the model of the lisa orbits used in the simulations ; for the initial challenges , this amounts to the ` initialposition ` and ` initialrotation ` needed to fully specify the pseudo - lisa orbits of sec .  [",
    "sec : orbits ] . *",
    "a _ noise data _ section describing the models of the lisa noises used in the simulations ; for the initial challenges , this amounts to the power spectral densities and generation timesteps of the pseudo - random sequences described in sec .",
    "[ sec : noises ] . *",
    "a _ source data _ section describing the gravitational waveform(s ) included in the simulation .",
    "the sources may be specified in terms of the standard source parameters defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : sources ] ; otherwise , they may be represented as explicit time series of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 gravitational strains at the ssb , plus a minimal set of parameters including the source s sky position and the time offset , cadence , and length of the time series . *",
    "a _ tdi data _ section containing one or more time series of tdi observables , assembled from lisa s response to noises and/or sources , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : tdi ] ; for the initial challenges , the observables of choice are @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 of tdi 1.5 , plus ( trivially ) the ssb time .",
    "the standard names of these observables are ` xp ` , ` yp ` , and ` zp ` for the equivalent - strain version of the data sets ( generated with the lisa simulator ) , and ` xf ` , ` yf ` , and ` zf ` for the fractional - frequency  fluctuation version ( generated with synthetic lisa ) .    thus , training data sets will be represented by mldc files including all types of sections ; on the other hand , challenge data sets ( which must be `` blind '' ) will omit the source - data section .",
    "different combinations of the sections appear in the intermediate files used in the mldc workflow , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : workflow ] .",
    "the mldc file format is implemented using xml ( the extensible markup language ) , a simple , flexible text format related to html , and widely used in the exchange , manipulation , and storage of many kinds of data , especially on the world - wide web @xcite .",
    "software libraries to handle xml are readily available for most computer languages .",
    "xml documents consist of a nested hierarchy of _ elements _ , enclosed by opening and closing _ tags _ ( ` < tagname > ` and ` <",
    "/tagname > ` ) , and containing textual data ; elements may also have textual _ attributes _ ( as in ` < tagname attrname = attrvalue > ` ) .",
    "white space and newlines have no meaning within xml ( any sequence of such characters is in fact equivalent to a single white space ) , but they are usually added liberally to help human parsing of the files .",
    "the xml implementation of the mldc file format ( known as lisaxml ) is based on xsil ( the extensible scientific interchange language ) , an xml dialect developed at caltech to represent scientific data in multiple applications @xcite .",
    "xsil is very terse ; its data structures consist of few simple building elements :    * ` < xsil name= ... type= ... > ` acts as a hierarchical container .",
    "for instance , the lisa - data section of an mldc file is represented by an ` < xsil type = lisadata > ` element , and the source - data section is represented by a ` < xsil type = sourcedata > ` element containing one or more ` < xsil name= ... type = planewave > ` elements . * ` < param name= ... unit= ... > ` is used to describe parameter values and their units . for gw sources , the ` name ` and ` unit ` attributes are those found in tables [ tab : common][tab : emri ] .",
    "for instance , ` galacticbinary ` may have ` < param name = frequency unit = hertz>1.0e-3</param > ` . * ` < array name= ... type= ... > ` is used to specify arrays of homogeneous data , such as the time series of tdi observables . in lisaxml ,",
    "the actual array elements are stored in separate binary files , but the ` array ` element contains information about the location , organization , and encoding of the binary files .",
    "the advantage of this hybrid xml / binary arrangement is that bulk data are represented in binary format , which can be saved , stored , and loaded very efficiently , while file metadata and the lisa , noise , and source parameters are contained in textual xml files that are easily parseable and editable by humans ( or by powerful xml libraries ) .",
    "in fact , lisaxml files can be viewed in standard - compliant web browsers such as firefox and safari , which will use a set of special lisaxml _ stylesheet transformations _ @xcite to render the metadata and nested parameters structures ( but not the bulk data ! ) as pleasantly formatted tables .",
    "* _ c / c++ . _",
    "the lisa tools subversion archive @xcite includes a directory ` lisaxml / io - c ` , which contains lisaxml input ",
    "output routines in c ; tdi and strain time series are returned as simple c arrays , while source and time series parameters are stored in c structures . * _ python .",
    "_ routines to input and output lisaxml are built into the python - steered synthetic lisa @xcite , which can read ( write ) strain and tdi time series into ( from ) standard numpy arrays @xcite .",
    "in addition , the synthetic lisa python / c++ objects that describe the lisa geometry , the lisa noises , and gw sources can also be translated to and from their lisaxml representation . *",
    "_ matlab . _",
    "the program ` xml2matlab.c ` , found in directory ` lisaxml / c - exam``ples ` in the lisa tools subversion archive @xcite , can be compiled into a matlab mex function that will read lisaxml tdi time series into a matlab array . * _ ascii . _",
    "the program ` xml2ascii.c ` , in the same location , can be compiled into a command - line utility that will dump lisaxml tdi time series into a tab - separated ascii file , or to standard output .",
    "all these tools are still in development at the time of writing , but all are already quite functional in reading mldc data sets into analysis applications . for more detailed instructions on reading lisaxml files , see the mldc omnibus documents @xcite and the lisa tools sourceforge website @xcite ; these include also the instructions and scripts necessary to reproduce the mldc workflow and create additional training sets .",
