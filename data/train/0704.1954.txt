    "cahn action functional _ @xmath0 this functional arises in the analysis of the stochastically perturbed allen  cahn equation @xcite and is related to the probability of rare events such as switching between deterministically stable states .",
    "compared to the purely deterministic setting , stochastic perturbations add new features to the theory of phase separations , and the analysis of action functionals has drawn attention @xcite . kohn _",
    "@xcite considered the _ sharp - interface limit _",
    "@xmath1 of @xmath2 and identified a _ reduced action functional _ that is more easily accessible for a qualitative analysis .",
    "the sharp interface limit reveals a connection between minimizers of @xmath2 and mean curvature flow .",
    "the reduced action functional in @xcite is defined for phase indicator functions @xmath3 with the additional properties that the measure of the phase @xmath4 is continuous and the common boundary of the two phases @xmath5 and @xmath6 is , apart from a countable set of singular times , given as union of smoothly evolving hypersurfaces @xmath7 .",
    "the reduced action functional is then defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the @xmath10 component of @xmath11 at the time of creation , where @xmath12 denotes the normal velocity of the evolution @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the mean curvature vector of @xmath15 , and where the constant @xmath16 is determined by @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( see section [ sec : discussion ] for a more rigourous definition of @xmath19 ) .",
    "several arguments suggest that @xmath19 describes the gamma - limit of @xmath2 :    * the _ upper bound _",
    "necessary for the gamma - convergence was formally proved @xcite by the construction of good ` recovery sequences ' . *",
    "the _ lower bound _ was proved in @xcite for sequences @xmath20 such that the associated ` energy - measures ' have _ equipartitioned energy _ and _ single multiplicity _ as @xmath1 . * in one space - dimension reznikoff and tonegawa @xcite proved that @xmath2 gamma - converges to an appropriate relaxation of the one - dimensional version of @xmath19 .",
    "the approach used in @xcite is based on the evolution of the phases and is sensible to cancellations of phase boundaries in the sharp interface limit .",
    "therefore in @xcite a sharp lower bound is achieved only under a single - multiplicity assumption for the limit of the diffuse interfaces . as a consequence",
    ", it could not be excluded that creating multiple interfaces reduces the action .    in the present paper",
    "we prove a sharp lower - bound of the functional @xmath2 in space dimensions @xmath21 without any additional restrictions on the approximate sequences .    to circumvent problems with cancellations of interfaces we analyze the evolution of the ( diffuse ) _ surface - area measures _ , which makes information available that is lost in the limit of phase fields .",
    "with this aim we generalize the functional @xmath19 to a suitable class of _ evolving energy measures _ and introduce a generalized formulation of velocity , similar to brakke s generalization of mean curvature flow @xcite .",
    "let us informally describe our approach and main results . comparing the two functionals @xmath2 and @xmath19 the first and second term of the sum in the integrand describe a ` diffuse velocity ' and ` diffuse mean curvature ' respectively .",
    "we will make this statement precise in and .",
    "the mean curvature is given by the first variation of the area functional , and a lower estimate for the square of the diffuse mean curvature is available in a time - independent situation @xcite .",
    "the velocity of the evolution of the phase boundaries is determined by the time - derivative of the surface - area measures and the nucleation term in the functional @xmath19 in fact describes a singular part of this time derivative .",
    "our first main result is a compactness result : the diffuse surface - area measures converge to an evolution of measures with a square integrable generalized mean curvature and a square integrable generalized velocity . in the class of such evolutions of measures we provide a generalized formulation of the reduced action functional .",
    "we prove a lower estimate that counts the propagation cost with the multiplicity of the interface .",
    "this shows that it is more expensive to move phase boundaries with higher multiplicity .",
    "finally we prove two statements on the gamma - convergence ( with respect to @xmath22 ) of the action functional .",
    "the first result is for evolutions in the domain of @xmath19 that have nucleations only at the initial time .",
    "this is in particular desirable since minimizers of @xmath19 are supposed to be in this class .",
    "the second result proves the gamma convergence in @xmath22 under an assumption on the structure of the set of measures arising as sharp interface limits of sequences with uniformly bounded action .",
    "we give a precise statement of our main results in section [ sec : results ] . in the remainder of this introduction",
    "we describe some background and motivation .      most _ diffuse interface models _ are based on the _ van  der  waals  cahn  hilliard _ energy @xmath23 the energy @xmath24 favors a decomposition of @xmath25 into two regions ( phases ) where @xmath26 and @xmath27 , separated by a transition layer ( diffuse interface ) with a thickness of order @xmath28 .",
    "modica and mortola @xcite proved that @xmath24 gamma - converges ( with respect to @xmath29-convergence ) to a constant multiple of the perimeter functional @xmath30 , restricted to phase indicator functions , @xmath31 @xmath30 measures the surface - area of the phase boundary @xmath32 . in this sense @xmath24",
    "describes a diffuse approximation of the surface - area functional .",

    "it is proved in different formulations @xcite that converges to the _ mean curvature flow _",
    "@xmath36 for the evolution of phase boundaries .",
    "another connection between the first variations of @xmath24 and @xmath30 is expressed in a ( modified ) conjecture of de giorgi @xcite : considering @xmath37 the sum @xmath38 gamma - converges up to the constant factor @xmath16 to the sum of the perimeter functional and the _ willmore functional _",
    "@xmath39 , @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the phase boundary @xmath32 .",
    "this statement was recently proved by rger and schtzle @xcite in space dimensions @xmath21 and is one essential ingredient to obtain the lower bound for the action functional .",
    "phenomena such as the nucleation of a new phase or the switching between two ( local ) energy minima require an energy barrier crossing and are out of the scope of deterministic models that are energy dissipative .",
    "if thermal fluctuations are taken into account such an energy barrier crossing becomes possible . in @xcite",
    "` thermally activated switching ' was considered for the _ stochastically perturbed allen  cahn equation _ @xmath42 here @xmath43 is a parameter that represents the temperature of the system , @xmath44 is a time - space white noise , and @xmath45 is a spatial regularization with @xmath46 as @xmath47 .",
    "this regularization is necessary for @xmath48 since the white noise is too singular to ensure well - posedness of in higher space - dimensions .",
    "large deviation theory and ( extensions of ) results by wentzell and freidlin @xcite yield an estimate on the probability distribution of solutions of stochastic odes and pdes in the small - noise limit .",

    "large deviation theory not only estimates the probability of rare events but also identifies the ` most - likely switching path ' as the minimizer @xmath54 in .",
    "we focus here on the sharp interface limit @xmath1 of the action functional @xmath2 .",
    "the small parameter @xmath55 corresponds to a specific diffusive scaling of the time- and space domains .",
    "this choice was identified @xcite as particularly interesting , exhibiting a competition between _ nucleation versus propagation _ to achieve the optimal switching . depending on the value of @xmath56 a cascade of more and more complex spatial patterns",
