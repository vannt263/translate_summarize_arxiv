    "when a molecule moves in the simulation box , its periodic image in each one of the replication boxes moves in exactly the same way .",
    "thus , as a molecule leaves the simulation box , one of its images will enter through the opposite face at exactly the same point .",
    "the configuration of the molecules inside the simulation box generates the entanglement present in the continuum .",
    "because of this , the periodic system induces special features in the entanglement of the simulated polymer melt . for each chain in the melt",
    "we can distinguish between two types of topological constraints imposed on it by the other chains : local topological constraints , which can be observed inside a simulation box , and large scale topological constraints , which are observed only at a larger length .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to describe methods by which one may quantify and extract local entanglement information in a system with pbc .",
    "more precisely , in section 2 we describe the structure of the pbc polymer melt model . in section 3",
    "we introduce the periodic linking number and the local periodic linking number as measures of entanglement in such a system with pbc and we study their properties . in section 4",
    "we apply the local periodic linking number to polyethylene ( pe ) melts and study the effect of the creta algorithm on the linking present in the system .",
    "we study a polymer melt consisting of a collection of polymer chains of length @xmath16 , by dividing space into a family of cubic boxes of volume @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the length of an edge of the cube , so that the structure of the melt in each cube is identical , i.e. we impose pbc on the melt @xcite .",
    "specifically , we make the following definition :    a _ cell _ consists of a cube with @xmath19 arcs embedded into it such that arcs may terminate only in the interior of the cube or on a face , but not on an edge or corner , and those arcs which meet a face satisfy the pbc requirement .",
    "that is , to each ending point corresponds a starting point at exactly the same position on the opposite face of the cube .",
    "see figure [ theod](b ) for an illustrative example .",
    "a cell generates a _ periodic system _ in 3-space by tiling 3-space with the cubes so that they fill space and only intersect on their faces .",
    "this allows an arc in one cube to be continued across a face into an adjacent cube and so on . since",
    "physical chains are of finite length , we require that resulting chains must be compact . for practical purposes , only a finite number of copies of the cell are considered .",
    "we call such a collection a _ finite periodic system_.    without loss of generality , we choose a cell of the periodic system that we call _ generating cell_. then any other cell @xmath20 in the periodic system is a translation of the generating cell by a vector @xmath21 .",
    "a _ generating chain _ is the union of all the segments inside the cell the translations of which define a maximal connected arc in the periodic system . for each arc of a generating chain",

    ", the topological constraints have a strongly local character and one may wish to focus attention on the local tcs @xcite . as a consequence , the following local periodic linking measure may provide a more relevant measure of the entanglement observed in a polymer melt .",

    "we note that if the chains do not touch the faces of the cell , and thus lie entirely inside the cell , @xmath36 and @xmath0 are equal to the gauss linking number of the two chains .",

    "we will study @xmath36 and its relation to @xmath0 .    .",
    "the red curve does not intersect the minimal unfolding of the blue curve , but they are topologically linked .",
    "if the blue chain moves into the blue cell , then the red curve will intersect its minimal unfolding and @xmath43.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    [ crem]the local periodic linking number , @xmath0 , depends upon the size of the cell .",
    "also , as the minimal unfolding may change under the motion of @xmath7 , then @xmath0 may change as well .",
    "thus @xmath0 is not a topological invariant for two closed free chains .",
    "the minimal unfolding of an image , say @xmath9 , is homeomorphic to a 3-manifold , say @xmath44 .",
    "if the genus of @xmath44 is greater than @xmath45 , there may be an image of @xmath8 that is linked with @xmath9 but that does not intersect the minimal unfolding of @xmath9 ( see figure [ counter ] ) .",
    "we note though , that the size of a simulation cube that is appropriate for the simulation of polymer melts and other polymer systems , is such that it is impossible for conformations such as the one shown in figure [ counter ] to arise .",
    "so , for all practical purposes , the local periodic linking number is an invariant under the isotopic motion of closed chains .",
    "[ sym ] the local periodic linking number @xmath0 between two free chains @xmath7 and @xmath8 of a system with pbc is symmetric , that is @xmath15 .",
    "let us consider an image of @xmath8 , say @xmath10 , that intersects the minimal unfolding of an image of @xmath7 , say @xmath9 .",
    "then every other image of @xmath8 that intersects the minimal unfolding of @xmath9 is a translation of @xmath10 by a vector @xmath46 .",

    "thus the translation of @xmath9 by @xmath48 , i.e. @xmath49 , intersects the minimal unfolding of @xmath10 .",
    "the local periodic linking number is a continuous function .",
    "indeed , the set of points of discontinuity in the space of possible configurations is of measure zero , so @xmath0 is a continuous function of the chain coordinates almost everywhere .",
    "the following properties follow from the fact that @xmath0 is a measure of entanglement .",
    "\\(i ) in the case of closed chains @xmath0 is an integer . indeed , it is equal to half the algebraic number of crossings between a projection of an image of @xmath7 , say @xmath9 , and the projection of the images of @xmath8 which intersect the minimal unfolding of @xmath9 in any generic projection direction . for closed chains",
    "whose minimal unfolding has genus zero , then @xmath0 is invariant under movement of the chain .",
    "\\(ii ) in the case of open chains , @xmath0 is equal to the average algebraic number of crossings between a projection of an image of @xmath7 , say @xmath9 , and the projection of the images of @xmath8 that intersect the minimal unfolding of @xmath9 . moreover",
    ", as the endpoints of the generating chains move closer , @xmath0 tends to the local linking periodic number of the closed free chains .",
    "further , the local periodic linking number has the following properties with respect to the structure of the cell :    \\(i ) @xmath0 captures the contributions of all the local tcs that the one free chain imposes on an image of the other , but it also takes into account the global geometrical structure of the chains .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath0 is independent of the choice of the cell and of the translated image of a free chain @xmath7 that we use for the computation of @xmath41 with another free chain @xmath8 .",
    "\\(iii ) for closed chains in a periodic system , one may amalgamate cells to create larger generating cells in a new pbc such that @xmath43 , and then @xmath0 is a topological invariant .",
    "systems which employ pbc consist of an infinite number of translations of a finite number of chains . applying a traditional measure of entanglement would imply computations involving an infinite number or , at least , a very large number of chains .",
    "furthermore , because of the periodicity of the system , there is a scale at which one has homogeneity , so that entanglement can be characterized by the local structure and the degree of its homogeneity .",
    "the local periodic linking number , @xmath0 , is computed using a finite number of cells and , therefore , a finite number of chains thereby reducing the complexity of its calculation .",
    "ideally , one would like to compute a linking measure directly from one cell , but the arcs of the generating chains inside the cell are relatively short . in order to capture the greater degrees of entanglement , or even complex",
    "knotting , a large number of arcs must be employed in the creation of a complex chain .",
    "the local periodic linking number is computed between long polymer chains , taking into consideration the entire geometrical structure of the chains . moreover ,",
    "if one wanted to constrain the analysis to a smaller number of cells , it would be impossible to give a definition of linking that is symmetric and captures all the entanglement present in a cell .",
    "indeed :    [ symm2 ] the local periodic linking number @xmath41 between two closed or open free chains @xmath7 and @xmath8 takes into consideration as few as possible cells required to assess all the local tcs that the one free chain imposes on an image of the other and at the same time to be symmetric .    the minimal unfolding ( _ mu _ ) of @xmath9 contains all the local tcs imposed to @xmath9 by @xmath8 .",
    "but we have that @xmath50 @xmath51 , where @xmath52 are the translated arcs of @xmath5 and @xmath4 in the minimal unfolding of @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively . by adding the missing terms in each summation until we get a symmetric definition of linking we",
    "obtain @xmath53 .",
    "to study the entanglement complexity present in a given polymer system , one has to coarse grain the polymer chains at a level where certain geometrical characteristics relevant to entanglement become evident @xcite .",
    "the creta ( contour reduction topological analysis ) @xcite algorithm fixes chain ends in space , and by prohibiting chain crossing , it minimizes ( shrinks ) simultaneously the contour lengths of all chains , until they become sets of rectilinear strands coming together at the nodal points ( tcs ) of a network of primitive paths .",
    "when there are no possible alignments left , then we shrink the diameter of the beads of each chain and continue the same process , until a minimum thickness is achieved and no alignment moves are possible .",
    "figure [ theod ] shows an atomistic polymer sample and the corresponding reduced network .",
    "the creta algorithm has been shown @xcite to give a meaningful representation of the underlying topology of a polymer melt by comparing it to experimental data . using the local periodic linking number @xmath0",
    ", we determine the extent to which the creta method preserves the linking measure of entanglement in pe melts , or if critical entanglement information is lost in the reduction process .",
    "also , we perform the same comparison after end - to - end closure of the chains of a pe melt and its creta reduced melt .    as we mentioned earlier , linear polymer chains are not linked or knotted in the topological sense . a method to study",
    "the entanglement of linear polymers is to perform closure of the chains and compute the resulting knot type @xcite . using @xmath0 we will test if the method of direct end - to - end closure @xciteis reliable and if @xmath0 can detect topological differences between the open and closed original and reduced systems .",
    "the data analyzed concerns 80 pe frames  @xcite of density @xmath54 .",
