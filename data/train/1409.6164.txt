    "careful control of the beam quality is essential for linear accelerators designed to deliver very high brightness electron beams for short wavelength free electron lasers ( fels ) .",
    "there are many beam properties which have to be observed and manipulated such as suppression of microbunching instability , creation of needed peak current , preservation of slice and projected emittances , etc .",
    "in this paper we are interested in some aspects of the control of transverse projected emittances .",
    "among the sources of the growth of transverse projected emittances are the incoherent and coherent synchrotron radiation ( csr ) withing magnetic bunch compressors as well as the other wake fields along the accelerator .",
    "a number of approaches which could help to reduce emittance growth due to csr wake during bunch compression were developed during last decades including different optics tricks , preparation of the initial beam current profile at the bunch compressor entrance and etc .",
    "( see , for example ,  @xcite and references therein ) .    still ,",
    "because the suggested schemes provide reduction but not complete cancellation of the emittance growth , the beam considered downstream of the compression system ( or at the linac exit ) could have nonzero transverse to longitudinal coupling terms in the beam matrix and therefore projected emittances could be further reduced if these correlations will be removed .    in general , in order to make complete transverse to longitudinal decoupling",
    ", it is necessary to have the possibility to act on particles depending on their longitudinal position within the bunch ( for example , one may involve transverse deflecting cavities for this purpose ) , which means that the system designed for the complete decoupling could be too complicated and somewhat difficult to operate in comparison with the benefit coming from the achievable reduction of the transverse projected emittances .",
    "in this paper we consider a more simple and more practical question : what one can do having at hand a magnetostatic correction system ? because the transfer matrix of a magnetostatic system could couple transverse and longitudinal particle coordinates only when the dispersions of the underlying magnetic structure are nonzero , the reduction of transverse projected emittances ( if any possible ) will always be accompanied by the creation of a potential source of beam transverse jitter due to the beam energy jitter , and one has to look for an appropriate balance of both .",
    "we show , in the framework of linear particle dynamics and with the self field effects neglected , that if in the beam matrix there are nonzero correlation terms between energy of particles and their transverse positions and momenta ( beam dispersions ) , then the transverse projected emittances can be reduced by letting the beam pass through magnetostatic system ( correction system ) with specially chosen nonzero lattice dispersions .",
    "the maximum possible reduction of the transverse projected emittances occurs when all beam dispersions are zeroed , and the values of the lattice dispersions required for that are completely determined by the values of the beam dispersions and the beam rms energy spread and are independent from any other second - order central beam moments . besides that",
    ", we prove that , alternatively , one can also use the lattice dispersions to remove linear correlations between longitudinal positions of particles and their transverse coordinates ( beam tilts ) , but in this situation solution for the lattice dispersions is nonunique and the reduction of the transverse projected emittances is not guaranteed .    note",
    "that this paper is an extended version of the unpublished note @xcite , which was written during discussion of the influence of different dispersive effects on the performance of the flash facility @xcite , and recently , when we get acquainted with the paper @xcite , our interest to this problem was renewed",
    ". both papers , @xcite and @xcite , employ unclosed lattice dispersions as a tuning knob for the control of the transverse projected emittances , but have somewhat different points of view on the practical realization of this idea and therefore the direct comparison of their results and recommendations is not very straightforward . as far as we are mostly discussing possibilities for correction which can be made downstream of the emittance growth and coupling source either by means of a dedicated correction system or even simply by special ( dispersive ) beam steering , the paper @xcite suggests to create dispersion nonclosure already in the bunch compressor , where the csr effect is strongest and can not be neglected .",
    "we consider the linear beam dynamics in an electromagnetic system which conserves the reference beam energy and take the path length along the reference orbit @xmath0 to be the independent variable .",
    "we use a complete set of symplectic variables    @xmath1    as particle coordinates @xcite . here",
    "@xmath2 measure the transverse ( horizontal and vertical ) displacements from the ideal orbit and @xmath3 are the corresponding canonical monenta scaled with the constant kinetic momentum of the reference particle @xmath4 .",
    "the variables @xmath5 and @xmath6 which describe the longitudinal dynamics are    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the energy of the reference particle , its velocity in terms of the speed of light @xmath10 and its arrival time at a certain position @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath11 be an @xmath12 square matrix .",
    "then @xmath13 denote the determinant of @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath14 be a nonempty subset of @xmath15 with its elements listed in increasing order .",
    "then @xmath16 denote the principal submatrix of @xmath11 whose entries are in the intersection of those rows and columns of @xmath11 specified by @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath11 is a symmetric matrix , we denote by @xmath17 the associated with this matrix quadratic form in @xmath18-variables @xmath19    @xmath20    besides that , we denote by @xmath21 the @xmath12 identity matrix and by    @xmath22    the @xmath23 symplectic unit matrix .    as usual",
    ", we describe the properties of a collection of points ( a particle beam ) in the three degrees of freedom ( 3d ) phase space by a @xmath24 symmetric matrix ( beam matrix ) of the second - order central beam moments    @xmath25    where the brackets @xmath26 denote an average over a distribution of the particles in the beam .",
    "let @xmath27 be the nondegenerated @xmath24 matrix which propagates particle coordinates from the state @xmath28 to the state @xmath29 , i.e let    @xmath30    then from ( [ intr_2 ] ) and ( [ intr_4 ] ) it follows that the matrix @xmath31 evolves between these two states according to the congruence    @xmath32    in the following we assume that the beam transport matrix @xmath27 is symplectic , which is equivalent to say that it satisfies the relation    @xmath33    by definition , the beam matrix @xmath31 is symmetric positive semidefinite and we restrict our considerations to the situation when this matrix is nondegenerated and therefore positive definite . for simplification of notations",
    "we also assume that the beam is proper centered and therefore has vanishing first - order moments @xmath34 . with this assumption",
    "the beam matrix takes on the form    @xmath35    where the elements    @xmath36    and the elements    @xmath37    we call beam dispersions and beam tilts , respectively .",
    "the matrix @xmath31 has twenty - one different entries which can be varied independently within the positive definiteness conditions .",

    ", we also pay attention to the changes in the beam energy chirp @xmath42 ( linear energy slope along the bunch length ) and in the rms bunch length squared @xmath43 .",
    "note that due to hadamar s determinantal inequality    @xmath44    and the equality in ( [ eindet ] ) holds if and only if the transverse degrees of freedom in the beam matrix are decoupled from each other @xcite , i.e. if and only if    @xmath45",
    "the most general form of the transport matrix of a magnetostatic system is    @xmath46    where the elements    @xmath47    are ( transverse and longitudinal ) lattice dispersions .",
    "the special form ( [ form01 ] ) of the matrix @xmath27 allows to rewrite the symplecticity condition ( [ form07symplcond ] ) in the form of a system of two equations    @xmath48    and    @xmath49    and using condition ( [ form022 ] ) one can show that every matrix @xmath27 of the form ( [ form01 ] ) can be represented as a product    @xmath50    where    @xmath51    is the dispersion - free part of the matrix @xmath27 and    @xmath52    is its dispersive part .    substituting the decomposition ( [ form03 ] ) into the beam matrix propagation equation ( [ form07 ] ) one obtains    @xmath53    this formula is a two step transformation . at first the incoming beam matrix @xmath54 is transported using the matrix @xmath55 and then this intermediate result",
    "is transformed using the matrix @xmath56 .",
    "because the action of the matrix @xmath56 does not alter longitudinal beam parameters , does not couple transverse and longitudinal projected emittances , and propagates the vector of beam dispersions and the vector of beam tilts simply as transverse coordinates of the particle trajectories ( i.e. without possibilities to create or to remove vectors of beam dispersions and beam tilts , and even without possibility simply to mix the vector of the beam dispersions with the vector of the beam tilts ) , the second step in the transport of the beam matrix can be omitted without loss of generality for any result of this paper .",
    "so , in the rest of this paper , we consider the changes in properties of the incoming beam matrix @xmath54 which are of interest for us under the action of the matrix @xmath55 only . because it is impossible to associate with this action some certain position in the beam line",
    ", we write it symbolically as follows    @xmath57    and call this transformation as the beam passage through the dispersive part of the correction system .",
    "note that the formulas obtained below for the simplified propagation rule ( [ s01 ] ) can be translated into the formulas for the complete transport equation ( [ form07 ] ) with the help of the decomposition of the matrix @xmath27 in the form of a product    @xmath58    where    @xmath59    and the matrix @xmath56 remains the same as given in ( [ form04 ] ) . to make such a translation in the selected formula one has to make the following changes in its right hand side : substitute the lattice dispersions @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 instead of the lattice dispersions @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 according to the rule    @xmath68    and substitute the elements of the matrix @xmath69 instead of the corresponding elements of the matrix @xmath54 .",

    "it gives an additional possibility to simplify calculations if one cares about transport of the projected emittances only , but because we are also interested in the behavior of the rms bunch length and the beam energy chirp , we prefer to keep the @xmath70 coefficient in the matrices @xmath55 and @xmath71 .      in order to obtain convenient representation for the emittance transport problem ,",
    "let us introduce a @xmath72 symmetric matrix    @xmath73    because leading principal minors of this matrix can be expressed through the principal minors of the positive definite matrix @xmath31 as follows    @xmath74    @xmath75    @xmath76    @xmath77    all leading principal minors of the matrix @xmath78 are positive , which means that the matrix @xmath78 is positive definite according to the sylvester criterion @xcite .",
    "note that the elements of this matrix ( similar to the elements of the matrix @xmath79 given below in ( [ matrixb ] ) ) do not depend on the second - order beam moments involving the longitudinal variable @xmath5 .    with the help of the positive definite quadratic form @xmath80 associated with the matrix @xmath78",
    ", the evolution of the 1d projected emittances through the dispersive part of the correction system can be expressed as follows :    @xmath81    @xmath82    where    @xmath83    @xmath84    @xmath85    where    @xmath86    @xmath87    @xmath88    @xmath89    where    @xmath90    one sees from the propagation rules obtained that while the beam tilts and the beam energy chirp can influence the evolution of the longitudinal projected emittance @xmath91 through the solution of the equation ( [ optsolutionz ] ) , they do not enter the formulas for the evolution of the transverse projected emittances @xmath92 and @xmath93 at all",
    ".      in the previous subsection the evolution of all three 1d projected emittances was expressed using the single quadratic form @xmath80 .",
    "unfortunately , to describe the evolution of the 2d transverse projected emittance another , different from @xmath80 , quadratic form is needed .",
    "we denote this form @xmath94 and associated it with the positive definite symmetric matrix    @xmath95    @xmath96^{-1}\\left\\{1,2,3,4\\right\\}. \\label{matrixb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the help of this new quadratic form the evolution of the 2d transverse projected emittance can be expressed as follows :    @xmath97    @xmath98    @xmath99    where @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 are the same as given by the formulas ( [ optsolutionxx ] ) and ( [ optsolutionyy ] ) .    note",
    "that though one may accept without additional questions the fact that the right hand sides of the formulas ( [ evolutionex ] ) and ( [ evolutioney ] ) are the second order polynomials with respect to the lattice dispersions , the same property of the right hand side of the formula ( [ evolutionet ] ) might be somewhat more surprising .",
    "for example , let us assume that the beam matrix is transversely uncoupled at the exit of the dispersive part of the correction system .",
    "then the right hand side of the formula ( [ evolutionet ] ) must coincide with the product of the right hand sides of the formulas ( [ evolutionex ] ) and ( [ evolutioney ] ) and therefore should contain a polynomial of the fourth order with respect to the variables @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "because the formula ( [ evolutionet ] ) does not provide such a possibility , our assumption must be wrong and , during the passage of the dispersive part of the correction system , the coupling between transverse degrees of freedom in the beam matrix must be created .",
    "this coupling is described by the following propagation rules    @xmath104    @xmath105    @xmath106    @xmath107    and , as it can be shown by direct calculations , it really does not allow to the terms of the order higher than two with respect to the variables @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 to appear in the right hand side of the formula ( [ evolutionet ] ) .",
    "transformation of the transverse to longitudinal coupling terms in accordance with the transport rule ( [ s01 ] ) produces the following changes in the beam dispersions    @xmath108    and the following changes in the beam tilts    @xmath109    @xmath110    where the parameter @xmath111 is defined by the expression    @xmath112      the transformation of the beam energy chirp @xmath113 is given by the above introduced parameter @xmath111    @xmath114    and for the description of the change in the rms bunch length squared @xmath43 the new quadratic form is needed again .",
    "this time it must be quadratic form not in four but in five variables , because as far as the evolution of the projected emittances does not depend from the @xmath70 matrix coefficient , the evolution of the bunch length certainly does .",
    "so , let us introduce quadratic form @xmath115 associated with the positive definite matrix    @xmath116    and represent the evolution of @xmath43 in the form    @xmath117    @xmath118    @xmath119    where    @xmath120    note that , if for some reasons the variation of the @xmath70 coefficient is not allowed and it can be treated as a given parameter , then one can return to the usage of quadratic form in four variables and rearrange the formulas ( [ evolutionbl11 ] ) and ( [ optsolutionbl11 ] ) as follows :    @xmath121    @xmath122    @xmath123    where now    @xmath124    @xmath125",
    "with the formulas developed in the previous section for the emittance transport the problem of optimization of transverse projected emittances by an appropriate choice of the lattice dispersions becomes ( at least from the theoretical point of view ) fairly simple and straightforward .",
    "for example , the formula ( [ evolutionex ] ) tell us that the change in the horizontal projected emittance @xmath92 after the system passage is the same for all lattice dispersions @xmath64 and @xmath65 belonging to the same level set    @xmath126    because the function @xmath80 is a positive definite quadratic form its level sets for @xmath127 are ellipses all centered at the same point    @xmath128    and contracting to this point as @xmath129 .",
    "the level set    @xmath130    plays a special role .",
    "it separates the lattice dispersions which lead to the emittance increase from the lattice dispersions which provide emittance reduction or preservation . the level surface ( [ ellipseex ] )",
    "is an ellipse if at least one horizontal beam dispersion is nonzero at the correction system entrance and it is a point coinciding with the common center ( [ ellipseexc ] ) of all ellipses ( [ ellipseex01 ] ) otherwise . in any case there",
    "exists unique optimal choice ( optimal solution ) for the horizontal lattice dispersions which is given by the equation ( [ ellipseexc ] ) and which provides the largest possible reduction of the horizontal projected emittance @xmath92 ( the largest possible reduction is zero if both horizontal beam dispersions are equal to zero ) .    by analogy",
    ", the optimal solution for the transport of the vertical projected emittance @xmath93 is reached in the point    @xmath131    and the optimal solution for the transport of the complete 2d transverse projected emittance @xmath132 is given by the union of the solution for the horizontal motion ( [ ellipseexc ] ) and the solution for the vertical motion ( [ ellipseeyc ] ) , which is a very pleasant fact ( in general , if the chosen lattice dispersions are different from the optimal solution , then the reduction of both @xmath92 and @xmath93 does not guarantee the reduction of @xmath132 , and vice versa ) .",
    "one sees that the values of the lattice dispersions required for the simultaneous minimization of all transverse projected emittances are completely determined by the values of the beam dispersions and the beam rms energy spread , but , even if these quantities are unknown and there is no appropriate diagnostics to measure them , the projected emittances still can be optimized if there is a possibility to measure the horizontal and vertical projected emittances downstream of the correction system .",
    "in this situation , minimization of emittances can be done iteratively ( and independently for horizontal and vertical degrees of freedom ) employing one of the many available effective algorithms for minimizing a convex quadratic objective function of two variables .",
    "the optimal solution for all four lattice dispersions @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 can be written in the form    @xmath133    and therefore satisfies the orthogonality condition    @xmath134    with the optimal choice of the lattice dispersions ( [ optsol01 ] ) the beam dispersions are zeroed at the correction system exit and the tilts are transformed according to the rule    @xmath135    @xmath136    where , as one sees , the dependence from the @xmath70 matrix coefficient presented in the formula ( [ evolutionbt ] ) disappeared , though no assumptions were made about this coefficient and the optimal lattice dispersions ( [ optsol01 ] ) also do not depend on it .",
    "the transport of the transverse coupling terms is given now by the formulas    @xmath137    @xmath138    @xmath139    @xmath140    and one sees that if both , horizontal and vertical , beam dispersion vectors are nonzero at the entrance , then the interplay between them during the passage of the dispersive part of the correction system becomes a source of the transverse coupling .",
    "this coupling could be removed by adding to the correction system an appropriate set of the skew quadrupoles and , therefore , the 1d transverse projected emittances can be reduced even further .    in order to find better expressions for the reduction of the transverse projected emittances than the expressions which one can obtain by the direct substitution of the optimal solution ( [ optsol01 ] ) into the emittance propagation formulas ,",
    "let us introduce positive definite quadratic forms @xmath141 and @xmath142 associated with the positive definite matrices    @xmath143    and    @xmath144    respectively .",
    "the advantage of these quadratic forms over the quadratic forms @xmath80 and @xmath94 is that the elements of their matrices @xmath145 and @xmath146 are functions of the transverse beam moments only and do not depend on the beam moments involving the longitudinal variable @xmath6 as do the elements of the matrices @xmath78 and @xmath79 . besides that    @xmath147    @xmath148    where",

    "it is simplified owing to the orthogonality condition ( [ optsol02 ] ) to the form    @xmath159    and the propagation formula for the rms bunch length squared @xmath43 , if needed , can be obtained using the equations ( [ evolutionezopt ] ) and ( [ energychirpopt ] ) , and the relation    @xmath160      the formulas ( [ evolutionetopt ] ) and ( [ evolutionezopt ] ) for the transport of the 2d transverse projected emittance @xmath132 and the longitudinal projected emittance @xmath91 can be further simplified if one assumes that the conditions ( [ nocouplxy678 ] ) hold and the transverse degrees of freedom in the beam matrix @xmath31 are decoupled from each other at the correction system entrance . with this assumption",
    "matrices @xmath145 and @xmath146 become block diagonal , quadratic forms @xmath141 and @xmath142 get representations    @xmath161    @xmath162    and , as the result , one obtains    @xmath163    @xmath164 , \\label{evolutionetopt2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath165    @xmath166    @xmath167    note that the formula ( [ optlongemmnocoupl ] ) also can be obtained from equations ( [ coplingxyopt])-([coplingpxpyopt ] ) , ( [ evolutionexopt])-([evolutioneyopt ] ) and conditions ( [ nocouplxy678 ] ) using conservation of the lysenko invariant @xcite    @xmath168    @xmath169    during symplectic transport of the beam matrix .",
    "as the formulas ( [ evolutionez ] ) and ( [ optsolutionz ] ) show , the problem of optimization of the longitudinal projected emittance by the proper choice of the lattice dispersions ( when considered alone ) has the same geometry as the corresponding problems for the transverse projected emittances .",
    "the resulting @xmath91 increase or reduction depends on the positioning of the chosen lattice dispersions @xmath64 ,",
    "@xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 with respect to the four dimensional ellipsoid            but , in contrast to the transport of the transverse projected emittances , the longitudinal projected emittance can be reduced even when all beam dispersions are equal to zero at the correction system entrance , because ( according to the equation ( [ optsolutionz ] ) ) the optimal solution ( [ evolutionezls2 ] ) depends also on the values of the beam tilts .    it is outside of the purpose of this paper to make a detailed study of the influence of the solution ( [ evolutionezls2 ] ) on the propagation of the other beam parameters and let us only note that it makes the vector of the beam dispersions and the vector of the beam tilts linearly dependent ( parallel ) at the exit of the dispersive part of the correction system .",
    "it comes from the fact that the choice of the lattice dispersions according to the equations ( [ evolutionezls2 ] ) gives us the following transport rule for the beam dispersions              thus , what is important for our further considerations , both solutions ( [ optsol01 ] ) and ( [ evolutionezls2 ] ) zero the last two terms in the lysenko invariant ( [ lysenkoinvariant ] ) at the exit of the correction system .",
    "[ [ conditions - for - simultaneous - optimization - of - transverse - and - longitudinal - projected - emittances ] ] conditions for simultaneous optimization of transverse and longitudinal projected emittances ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    with our approach , the problem of the simultaneous optimization of the selected projected emittances by a proper choice of the lattice dispersions becomes a geometrical problem .",
    "for example , emittances @xmath92 and @xmath91 can be decreased simultaneously if and only if the surfaces ( [ evolutionezls ] ) and ( [ ellipseex ] ) are non - degenerate ( i.e. they are not points but real ellipsoids ) and the projection of the inner points of the ellipsoid ( [ evolutionezls ] ) onto the plane @xmath177 has nonempty intersection with the set of the inner points of the ellipse ( [ ellipseex ] ) .    the optimal solutions ( [ optsol01 ] ) and ( [ evolutionezls2 ] ) will be equal to each other and therefore the maximal possible reductions will be achieved for all , horizontal and vertical , projected emittances simultaneously ,",
    "if and only if the following relations between the elements of the beam matrix @xmath31 hold      we will discuss these relations in more detail in the following subsections and now let us only point out that the requirement for solution ( [ optsol01 ] ) to coincide with the first four components of the vector          which corresponds to the complete chirp removal at the correction system exit .",
    "note that the choice of the lattice dispersions ( including setting of the @xmath70 coefficient ) to be equal to the values ( [ vecs2opt ] ) minimizes the rms bunch length squared @xmath43 after the correction system passage .",
    "according to the relations ( [ evolutionbt ] ) and ( [ lambdad ] ) the beam tilts can be zeroed at the correction system exit by an appropriate choice of the correction lattice dispersions if and only if the system of equations            has at least one real solution with respect to the variables @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath70 . in general , it is a nonlinear system .",
    "nevertheless , as we prove below , it always has at least one real solution for every fixed real value of the @xmath70 coefficient , which therefore can be treated as a parameter . to show this ,",
    "let us assume first that @xmath111 in the system ( [ zbt01 ] ) is not simply a notation introduced for brevity , but is an additional real - valued variable , and let us consider an extended system consisting of equations ( [ zbt01 ] ) and ( [ zbt02 ] ) .",
    "now we want to apply the method of successive elimination of variables to the system obtained and with this purpose in mind let us observe that              is invertible .",
    "it means that for every real value of @xmath111 equations ( [ zbt01 ] ) can be solved with respect to the variables @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and the solution is unique . substituting this solution into equation ( [ zbt02 ] ) and multiplying both sides of the result by        we obtain the polynomial equation of the fifth degree with respect to the single variable @xmath111 ( consistency equation ) and , because the order of this equation is odd",
    ", it always must have at least one real root .",
    "so we proved that the zeroing of the beam tilts by an appropriate choice of the correction lattice dispersions is always possible .",
    "at least one solution can be found for all real values of the @xmath70 matrix coefficient and , for the fixed @xmath70 value , the number of solutions can vary from one to five .",
    "the effect of the zeroing of the beam tilts in the matrix ( [ numm01 ] ) on projected emittances is presented at figures 1 and 2 , where the resulting emittances are shown for all possible real solutions of the equation ( [ numm03 ] ) .",
    "one has to compare these emittances with the emittances @xmath197 , @xmath198 of the original beam matrix ( [ numm01 ] ) and with the emittances @xmath199 , @xmath200 which can be obtained after removal of the beam dispersions .",
    "the example considered in the previous subsection tells us that zeroing of the beam tilts does not necessarily implies reduction of the transverse projected emittances .",
    "the situation , of course , will be different if zeroing of the beam tilts will simultaneously remove the beam dispersions , i.e. if the longitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom in the beam matrix @xmath31 will be decoupled from each other at the correction system exit .",
    "the necessary and sufficient conditions for the complete transverse to longitudinal decoupling can be obtained by the requirement that the solution for the lattice dispersions ( [ optsol01 ] ) which removes the beam dispersions also zeros the beam tilts , and substituting ( [ optsol01 ] ) into the equations ( [ zbt01 ] ) and ( [ zbt02 ] ) we obtain ( without big surprise ) again the equations ( [ decouplcond1 ] ) , which were derived as conditions for the simultaneous minimization of all projected emittances .",
    "the most difficult question , for which we do not have any good answers yet , is the question of the physical interpretation of the conditions ( [ decouplcond1 ] ) .",
    "it is clear , for example , that if the distortions to the initially uncoupled beam matrix @xmath31 were produced by a magnetostatic system , then the decoupling also can be done by a magnetostatic system , but how such beam matrices can be described more intuitively and what are the other possibilities ? currently , as more physical example in the comparison with the conditions ( [ decouplcond1 ] ) description , we only can state that all beam matrices with equal eigenemittances ( definition and properties of eigenemittances can be found in @xcite ) always can be decoupled by a magnetostatic system .",
    "it follows from the observation that the conditions ( [ decouplcond1 ] ) are equivalent to the property of the matrix @xmath201 to have zeros in the positions          we have seen that if in the beam matrix @xmath31 there are nonzero correlations between energy of particles and their transverse positions and momenta , then the values of the transverse projected emittances can be reduced , but how these reduced emittances are related to the emittances of the particle beam before it was damaged by the csr wake ( or by some other effects ) remains , of course , completely unclear .",
    "so , let us consider an example which would give at least some insights into this problem .",
    "our choice of the matrix @xmath205 as a source of the growth of the projected emittances and also as a source of the transverse to longitudinal coupling is motivated by the following reasons : the matrix @xmath205 , from one side , is symplectic and therefore all changes which it introduces are reversible , but it is not the matrix of a magnetostatic system and it is interesting to see up to what extend the original projected emittances of the matrix @xmath206 can be recovered afterwards by a magnetostatic correction system . from the other side ,",
    "this matrix , similar to the wake field action , provides transverse kick and energy loss to the particle depending on its longitudinal position within the bunch .",
    "note that if parameters @xmath207 and @xmath208 in this matrix are related to each other in some special way , then the matrix @xmath205 becomes equal to the matrix of the thick - lens horizontally deflecting cavity when it is sandwiched between two drifts of equal negative lengths ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the passage of the beam matrix ( [ form1960 ] ) through the system described by the matrix @xmath205 gives equal increase of horizontal and longitudinal projected emittances ( the vertical degree of freedom remains decoupled from the others and is ignored in the following considerations )                                  among the elements of the matrix @xmath31 .",
    "it means that both projected emittances can be recovered by a magnetostatic correction ( and also the beam matrix can be decoupled ) if and only if horizontal and longitudinal projected emittances were equal in the beginning before the passage through the system described by the matrix @xmath205 . but",
    "let us see what can be done if they were not .",
    "so , as the next step , let the beam pass through the dispersive part of the downstream correction system and , because we would like to express the final results using the elements of the original matrix ( [ form1960 ] ) , let us consider the transformation        the formulas ( [ evolutionex ] ) and ( [ evolutionez ] ) for the transport of the horizontal and longitudinal projected emittances , when adapted to the transport equation ( [ exam009 ] ) , can be rewritten as follows :                              note that in the above formulas @xmath230 is a positive definite quadratic form in two variables obtained from the quadratic form @xmath80 , and the exact expression for the @xmath231 matrix associated with the quadratic form @xmath230 is unimportant for the further consideration .",
    "so , as one sees , if @xmath234 , then only the larger of the two can be repaired and even can be further reduced , but only on expense of the increase of the other",
    ". nevertheless , even if the horizontal ( or longitudinal ) projected emittance can not be recovered to its original value , the distorted value ( [ example02 ] ) ( or ( [ example03 ] ) ) always can be reduced , as follows from the theory developed in this paper .",
    "let us now consider three extreme cases : solution for the lattice dispersions which minimizes @xmath92 , solution which minimizes @xmath91 and solution which zeros beam tilts . even before making any calculations",
    ", one can state that in all these three cases the sum      will be conserved , which follows from the preservation of the lysenko invariant ( [ lysenkoinvariant ] ) and the fact that all these solutions make the vector of the beam dispersions and the vector of the beam tilts linearly dependent at the correction system exit .",
    "note also that due to the conservation of the sum ( [ geom03 ] ) and due to the extremum properties of the solutions which minimize projected emittances , any solution which zeros beam tilts will give the final value of the transverse projected emittance which must lie between the values given by the solution which zeros beam dispersions and the solution which minimizes longitudinal projected emittance .",
    "unfortunately , it is practically impossible to find the general solutions for the lattice dispersions which are required for the zeroing of the beam tilts in the analytical form , and we will give it only for the partial case when @xmath244 . with this assumption the solution for the zeroing of the beam tilts is unique and is given by the following formulas                  one can check that while for @xmath250 the result of ( [ example11 ] ) is always smaller than the result of ( [ example02 ] ) ( as expected ) , the values produced by the formulas ( [ lonem02 ] ) and ( [ exr8 ] ) for @xmath234 can reduce the distorted emittance ( [ example02 ] ) only under specific conditions .                                        v.balandin , r.brinkmann , w.decking , and n.golubeva , `` twiss parameters of coupled particle beams with equal eigenemittances '' , proceedings of ipac 2012 , new orleans , louisiana , usa , may 20 - 25 , 2012 , tuppc008 ."
