    "emission of tev / pev gamma - rays associated with grbs has been extensively searched .",
    "these studies are motivated by both the experimental results obtained with the satellite experiments as e.g. egret and by theoretical models ( meszaros et al .",
    "@xcite ) which predict or at least allow tev emission to be produced in grbs .",
    "so far none of these searches have revealed any convincing evidence for vhe emission ( see for example aglietta et al .",

    "@xcite ; amenomori et al .",
    "@xcite ) . + up to now five batse grbs have been detected by egret with photons of energies up to 18 gev ( hurley et al .",
    "those grbs are among the most intense ones recorded by batse in the fov of egret , so observations are compatible with the hypothesis that all grbs emit gev photons but only the strongest ones are above the egret sensitivity . a simple power law extrapolation of the superbowl grb spectrum ( sommer et al .",
    "@xcite ) predicts that @xmath320 photons above 20 tev should be observed with the extensive air shower ( eas ) array of wide angle integrating cherenkov counters ( airobicc ) within 25 seconds while expecting only 0.1 background events .",
    "this would lead to a highly significant detection by several other experiments currently operating ( cherenkov telescopes , eas arrays ) .",
    "the previous extrapolation neglects source - intrinsic cutoffs and the attenuation through interaction with the low energy cosmic photon background ( wdowczyk et al .",
    "@xcite ; mannheim et al .",
    "@xcite ; stecker & de jager @xcite ) , which is expected for cosmological sources with redshift greater than 0.1 . another interesting feature of strong grbs is that their high energy emission can be delayed and have longer durations than kev ",
    "mev emission ( hurley et al .",
    "these ideas motivate searches for counterparts at times and with durations independent of those given by the space detectors at lower energies , especially when considering that the latter could miss grbs out of their fov , or with a very hard spectrum , as has been already suggested ( piran & narayan @xcite ; see also kommers et al .",
    "searches for grbs with the hegra experiment using other data periods can be found in krawczynski ( @xcite ) , funk ( @xcite ) , padilla et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , krawczynski et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , padilla ( @xcite ) .",
    "the airobicc array is part of the cosmic ray ( cr ) hegra detector complex located at the roque de los muchachos on the canary island la palma ( 28.75@xmath0 n , 17.89@xmath0 w , 2240 m a.s.l . ) .",
    "it is an array of 7x7 stations ( currently enlarged to 8x8 plus a subarray of 4x4 to increase detector density in the center ) with a regular grid spacing of 30 m , thus covering more than 32000 m@xmath4 .",
    "each station consists of a 40 cm diameter reflecting cone which focuses the incoming light onto a fast 20 cm diameter photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) .",
    "the set is placed inside a protective hut with a lid which can be opened through remote control .",
    "the pmt is covered with a blue filter ( @xmath5300 - 480 nm ) to improve signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "the pmt output is amplified in the hut and sent through a 150 m long cable to a constant fraction discriminator ( cfd ) placed in the electronics container .",
    "the cfd is set to a level equivalent to 5@xmath2 of the night sky background fluctuations .",
    "whenever six or more airobicc stations exceed the cfd threshold within 200 ns , a trigger is produced .",
    "calibrations are performed every 20 minutes to measure the relative delay between stations , the response of the tdc and the adc pedestals .",
    "the mean dead time after each recorded event is @xmath38 ms",
    ". detailed descriptions of airobicc and the other components of the hegra complex can be found in karle et al .",
    "@xcite , fonseca et al .",
    "@xcite , fonseca et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "+ the adc signals ( airobicc + scintillator array ) are used to locate the eas core position with a typical error @xmath618 m. the cherenkov light front is fitted by a cone to determine the arrival direction of the incident cr . the angular resolution ( angular distance containing 63% of events for a point source )",
    "is 0.29@xmath0 when 12 stations are fired ( standard cut ) and it continuously improves with increasing number of triggered huts . the absolute pointing accuracy has been estimated through comparison with the first hegra cherenkov telescope to be better than 0.2@xmath0 ( karle et al .",
    "the fov , which is limited by the acceptance of the winston cone , is 1 sr and the trigger rate is @xmath320 hz . the energy threshold ( 50% trigger probability ) is estimated to be @xmath316(25 ) tev for @xmath7s and @xmath329(37 ) tev for hadrons with zenith angle @xmath8 ) using flux and monte carlo studies ( martnez et al .",
    "the price that has to be paid for the advantages of the cherenkov technique ( lower energy threshold , better angular resolution ) is that observations are restricted to moonless clear nights ( @xmath310% duty cycle ) .",
    "the data analyzed in this work were taken during the first year of operation of airobicc , between march 1992 and march 1993 .",
    "the mean trigger rate in this period was @xmath316 hz . the sample contains @xmath9 events ( @xmath3800 hours ) and after a successful arrival direction reconstruction of those showers with @xmath107 fired stations , about @xmath11 events ( @xmath360% ) survive .",
    "it has been shown that due to the low counting statistics encountered when dealing with transient phenomena , one has to keep as many events as possible ; and so we do not apply the standard cut in the number of fired huts .",
    "the angular resolution is then @xmath12 .",
    "+ the analysis is based on a binned ( in time and in space ) all - sky search .",
    "we define an on window or source window and an off window or background window where events are counted for a certain time interval .",
    "the search strategy considers each event as being in the middle ( in time ) of a burst , so for every single event in the data sample we take a pair of on - off windows with a time interval centered at the time of the event .",
    "the on window is a circle of 0.7@xmath0 radius centered at the position of the event and the off window is an annulus of 1.5@xmath0 and 10.0@xmath0 radii concentric to the on window .",
    "the solid angles covered by the on and off windows are denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively , and their ratio @xmath15 by @xmath16 .",
    "there is always one event inside the on window and in order to not overestimate the significance of a possible signal this event is not counted .",
    "the size of the on window is chosen to maximize the s /",
    "n according to our resolution ( see above ) as described in alexandreas et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and it is expected to contain 75% of the events for a point source . while the size of the off window is taken as large as possible to increase statistics , its limit is due to the systematic error introduced because of the non - linear dependence of the counting rate on zenith angle ( alexandreas et al .",
    "we performed a monte carlo ( mc ) calculation to find the largest radius that keeps the systematic error much lower than the statistical error due to the low counting rate .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ error ] .",
    "the time intervals we chose are 10 seconds , 1 minute and 4 minutes which cover the usual long duration grbs .",
    "dead time and low counting rate do not allow searches for grbs with much shorter duration . + the employed procedure has the advantage of being very sensitive but it is also quite time consuming . so in order to look for tev - emission on longer time scales , a less sensitive search with a 1 hour time window and a classical non - overlapping rectangular grid of 0.5@xmath0x0.5@xmath0 in celestial coordinates has been carried out . in this case",
    "the background is estimated by means of a mc method as described in alexandreas et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . for every real event we generate 100 mc events with random directions following the acceptance function of airobicc ( obtained with the events of a whole run",
    ", therefore a different run implies a different acceptance function ) but with the same times as that of the original event .",
    "the number of mc events that fall within the on window determines the background .",
    "+ to obtain the significance for a hypothetical signal we use the probability distribution given in alexandreas et al .",
    "( @xcite ) which is appropriate for low statistics ( poissonian regime ) .",
    "it is the probability of observing at least @xmath17 events in the source window , given the observed number of background events @xmath18 , as a result of a background fluctuation : @xmath19 @xmath20    .90% confidence level upper limits for the integral flux ( in units of 10@xmath21 @xmath22 s@xmath23 ) of any hypothetical grb occurred in our data sample .",
