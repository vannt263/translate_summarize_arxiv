    "<S> hindered magnetic dipole transitions @xmath0 are studied in the covariant light - front approach . compared with the allowed magnetic dipole transitions , we find that results for hindered magnetic dipole transitions are sensitive to heavy quark mass and shape parameters of the light - front wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to tune the parameters so that the predictions of branching fractions of @xmath1 are consistent with the recent experimental data , but the relevant decay constant of @xmath2 is much smaller than that of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we also generalize the investigation to the charmonium sector and find the the same conclusion .    </S>",
    "<S> since the photon energy in allowed magnetic dipole ( m1 ) transitions is limited , hindered m1 transitions with changes of principal quantum numbers are believed to offer better chances to discover the pseudoscalar quarkoniums such as @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> several years ago , the cleo collaboration set the upper bounds for this kind of decays  @xcite @xmath4    in 2008 the babar collaboration observed a peak in the photon energy spectrum at @xmath5 mev in radiative @xmath6 decay  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is viewed as the first observation of the @xmath2 meson which is the lowest bottomonium ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the branching ratio of this radiative decay is @xmath7 the measured mass @xmath8 gives the mass split @xmath9 subsequently the @xmath2 meson has also been observed in the radiative @xmath10 decay  @xcite @xmath11 the ratio of the two branching fractions is measured as @xmath12 the recently updated results by the cleo collaboration  @xcite are consistent with measurements by the babar collaboration taking into account the uncertainties @xmath13    decay widths of m1 transitions can be expressed in a well - known formula @xmath14 @xmath15 is the fine - structure constant , @xmath16 denotes the charge in unit of @xmath17 of the transition quark , and @xmath18 denotes the quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 is the energy of the photon in the vector meson rest frame . for allowed transitions @xmath20 , </S>",
    "<S> the emitted photon is typically soft . </S>",
    "<S> one can expand the spherical bessel function @xmath21 by @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> radiative corrections and nonrelativistic corrections can be systematically studied in the effective field theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the predicted branching ratio of @xmath22 is well consistent with the experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> the emitted photon in hindered m1 transitions is rather energetic and the convergence of the expansion in @xmath19 becomes poor . on the other aspect , </S>",
    "<S> the decay amplitude is zero at the leading power in @xmath19 since the different wave functions are orthogonal . </S>",
    "<S> higher power terms contribute and they are sensitive to the treatments of the nonperturbative dynamics in transition form factors . for more than twenty years , hindered m1 transitions have received extensive interests but theoretical predictions vary over several orders  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the recent experimental data could offer an opportunity to investigate the dynamics in the quarkonia transition and in particular might be helpful to constrain the form of the wave functions .    </S>",
    "<S> in this work , we use the covariant light - front quark model ( lfqm ) to investigate the m1 transitions and examine whether the commonly - used light - front wave functions ( lfwf ) can simultaneously explain the experimental data for both allowed and hindered m1 transition . </S>",
    "<S> the light - front qcd may be the only potential candidate to reconcile the low energy quark model and the high energy parton model . </S>",
    "<S> the lfqm  @xcite can give a full treatment on spins of hadrons using the so - called melosh transformation . </S>",
    "<S> physical quantities are represented as the overlap of lfwf . </S>",
    "<S> these wave functions are expressed in terms of the internal variables of the quark and gluon degrees and thus are manifestly lorentz invariant . to preserve the covariance and remove the dependence of physical quantities on the direction of the light - front , jaus proposed the covariant lfqm in which the zero - mode contributions are systematically included  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the application of the covariant lfqm to the s - wave and p - wave decay constants and form factors is very successful  @xcite . under this framework , </S>",
    "<S> the transition @xmath23 has already been studied in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( see also ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    in the following </S>",
    "<S> we employ the light - front decomposition of the momentum @xmath24 , where @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> these momenta can be expressed in terms of the internal variables @xmath26 as : @xmath27 with @xmath28 . with these internal variables </S>",
    "<S> , one can define some useful quantities @xmath29 here @xmath30 can be interpreted as the energy of the quark / antiquark and @xmath31 can be viewed as kinetic invariant mass of the meson system . </S>",
    "<S> the transition amplitude of @xmath32 is usually parametrized as @xmath33 where the photon is firstly taken as off - shell @xmath34 and the convention @xmath35 is adopted . </S>",
    "<S> feynman diagrams for this process are given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : feyn ] , in which the photon is emitted from the quark shown in ( a ) or from the antiquark shown in ( b ) . due to the charge conjugation invariance </S>",
    "<S> , these two diagrams provide identical contributions . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to evaluate these two diagrams : @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39,\\\\   s_{\\mu\\nu}^b&=&{\\rm   tr}\\left[\\left(\\gamma_\\nu-\\frac{p_{1\\nu}-p_{2\\nu}}{w_v}\\right)(-p\\!\\!\\!\\slash_2+m_2 )   \\gamma_\\mu(-p\\!\\!\\!\\slash'_2+m_2 ) \\gamma_5(p\\!\\!\\!\\slash_1+m_1)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] functions @xmath40 , depending on the four momentum of the internal quarks , are the wave functions for vector and pseudoscalar mesons . in the absence of singularity in the @xmath40 , integrating over the minus component of the internal momentum will pick up the pole in the propagators . </S>",
    "<S> then the functions @xmath41 are replaced by @xmath42 which only depends on the plus component and the transverse momentum and @xmath43 is replaced by @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the momentum distribution inside the meson . in order to preserve the covariance , </S>",
    "<S> it is suggested that the zero mode contributions should be added in the covariant lfqm . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of the zero - mode contribution corresponds to a proper way to integrate out the minus component and after the integration expressions for the form factor @xmath47 are given as follows  @xcite @xmath48 and the decay width of @xmath49 is then evaluated as @xmath50    in the @xmath51 limit , the heavy quark inside the quarkonium moves nonrelativistically . </S>",
    "<S> integrating out the hard off - shell degrees of freedom , one reaches an effective field theory known as nonrelativistic qcd  @xcite to deal with the low energy dynamics . in a heavy quarkonium , </S>",
    "<S> the square of the transverse momentum @xmath52 is of the order @xmath53 and the momentum fraction of the heavy quark @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic invariant mass @xmath55 is roughly @xmath56 . at the leading power in @xmath57 , the form factor @xmath58 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : formfactor - lfqm ] ) is reduced to @xmath59 this formula , with the lfwf discussed in the following , could formally reproduce the leading power behavior shown in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : m1-space ] ) in the momentum space .    . </S>",
    "<S> ]    for hindered m1 transition , the transition amplitude is from the higher power corrections and one needs a specific approach to calculate them . </S>",
    "<S> as we can see from the above discussion , the form factors in the covariant lfqm are expressed as the overlap of the lfwf . </S>",
    "<S> it contains the nonperturbaitve coupling of the quark pair with a meson . except for some limited cases , </S>",
    "<S> these quantities can not be derived from the first principle . </S>",
    "<S> practically one often adopts a phenomenological form . </S>",
    "<S> the commonly - used wave function for the @xmath60-wave mesons with lowest principle number is the gaussian - type @xmath61 in the case of the wave functions of the @xmath62 mesons , we adopt the solutions of the harmonic - oscillator problem @xmath63 the fourier transformations , with the jacobi determinant @xmath64 , are derived as @xmath65 this kind of lfwf for the @xmath66 mesons has been used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite while its light - cone form is studied in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> . it would be meaningful to use the allowed and hindered m1 transitions to constrain the forms of the lfwf and in particular to test the harmonic - oscillator wave functions given above , as most of the previous studies in the covariant lfqm mainly focus on mesons without any radial excitation .    </S>",
    "<S> .input parameters in the light - front wave functions ( in units of gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as another check , we will extend the above discussion into the charmonium sector : @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant experimental data is given as  @xcite @xmath68 again with proper inputs the results in table  [ tab : results - etac ] could be consistent with these data , but the relevant decay constant of @xmath69 is much smaller that of its vector partner @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> our result for @xmath71 @xmath72 is approaching the experimental upper bound . </S>",
    "<S> the first uncertainties are from @xmath73gev and the second uncertainties are from @xmath74 gev . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the inputs @xmath75 gev , @xmath76 gev and @xmath77 gev are adopted and prediction of @xmath78 is consistent with the data reported by the cleo collaboration  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if we adopt these parameters , the branching ratio of @xmath79 is larger than the experimental data by two orders @xmath80 inspired by these inconsistencies , one may get the same conclusion as in the bottomonium sector .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , we studied the hindered m1 transitions @xmath79 and the @xmath81 in the covariant light - front quark model . compared with the allowed m1 transitions , theoretical results for hindered channels </S>",
    "<S> are found to strongly depend on quark masses and the shape of the light - front wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> because of this sensitivity , these transitions offer good laboratories to study the dynamics between the transitions and constrain the forms of the light - front wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> using the harmonic - oscillator wave functions and the experimental data , our results show that the decay constants of the pseudoscalar mesons are required to be much smaller than the decay constants of their vector partners . with the precise decay constants measured in various other channels in the future </S>",
    "<S> , different forms of the wave functions could be directly tested in the channels studied here . </S>",
    "<S> a more practical way in the future is to incorporate more radiative transitions between heavy quarkonium states as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ note added _ : during the long - time revision of this work , a similar paper  @xcite appears . </S>",
    "<S> one of the important differences is : we have shown that hindered m1 transitions are sensitive to the shape of the wave functions as they should . </S>"
