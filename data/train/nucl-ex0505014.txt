    "the study of nucleus - nucleus collisions at ultra - relativistic energies aims to characterize the dynamical processes by which matter at extreme densities is produced and the fundamental properties that this matter exhibits . in nucleus - nucleus collisions , how do partonic equilibration processes proceed ?",
    "for how long , over which spatial extension , and at which density is a qcd equilibration state approached , and what are its properties ?",
    "particle densities attained during a heavy ion collision are expected to exceed significantly the inverse volume of a hadron .",
    "this implies that the high temperature phase of qcd , the quark gluon plasma , comes within experimental reach .",
    "chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement phase transition are testable in heavy ion collisions .",
    "however , the experimental study of qcd at high temperatures and densities is complicated by the short lifetime and mesoscopic extension of the produced system .",
    "femtoscopy , the spatio - temporal characterization of the collision region on the femtometer scale , is needed to frame any discussion of dynamical equilibration processes .",
    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) just completed the first part of a dedicated experimental heavy ion program .",
    "center of mass energies ( @xmath0 gev ) exceeded those of previous fixed target experiments by a factor 10 .",
    "the current discussion of rhic data focuses mainly on several qualitatively novel phenomena that all support the picture that dense and rapidly equilibrating qcd matter is produced in the collision region  @xcite .",
    "in particular , identified single inclusive hadron spectra appear to emerge from a common flow field whose size and dependence on transverse momentum and azimuth is consistent with expectations that the produced matter is a locally equilibrated , almost ideal fluid of very small viscosity .",
    "moreover , high-@xmath1 hadron spectra show a centrality dependent , strong suppression in au+au collisions , but not in a d+au control experiment , indicating that even the hardest partons produced in the collision participate significantly in equilibration processes . in short , experiments at rhic",
    "have demonstrated already that heavy ion collisions produce dense and equilibrating matter , and that controlled experimentation of this matter is possible using a large variety of probes .    despite these successes ,",
    "numerous questions remain concerning the state of the matter produced in these collisions .",
    "most notably , the equation of state is far from being determined , and issues concerning chiral symmetry restoration are largely unresolved .",
    "addressing these fundamental questions about bulk matter requires a detailed understanding of the dynamics and chemistry of the collision , which can only be acquired by thorough and coordinated analyses of data and theory . in particular , spatio - temporal aspects of the reaction need to be experimentally addressed .",
    "the small size , @xmath2 m , and transient nature , @xmath3 seconds , of the reactions preclude direct measurement of times or positions . instead , femtoscopy must exploit measurements of asymptotic momenta .",
    "correlations of two final - state particles at small relative momentum provide the most direct link to the size and lifetime of subatomic reactions  @xcite . because correlations from either interactions or from identity interference are stronger for smaller separations in space - time , spatio - temporal information can be most easily extracted for small sources , unlike the limitations of microscopes and telescopes .",
    "the interference of two particles emitted from chaotic sources was first applied by hanbury - brown and twiss @xcite , where photons were exploited to determine source sizes for both laboratory and stellar sources in the 1950s and 1960s .",
    "correlations of identical pions were shown to be sensitive to source dimensions in proton - antiproton collisions by goldhaber , goldhaber , lee , and pais in 1960 @xcite . in the 1970s",
    ", these methods were refined by kopylov and podgoretsky @xcite , koonin , @xcite , and gyulassy @xcite , and other classes of correlations were shown to be useful for source - size measurements , such as strong and coulomb interactions .",
    "bevalac analyses showed that interferometry was truly capable of quantitatively determining spatial and temporal source dimensions @xcite and providing a stringent test of dynamical models @xcite . throughout the last 25 years",
    "this phenomenology has developed into a precision tool for heavy ion collisions .",
    "whereas hadronic sources are short lived and one measures correlations of the momentum of outgoing particles , stars are long lived and require experimental filters to enforce the approximate simultaneity of the two photons .",
    "although the theory for these two classes of measurement are very different @xcite , the heavy - ion community often uses the term _ hbt _ , in reference to hanbury - brown and twiss s original work with photons , to refer to any type of analysis related to size and shape that uses two particles at small relative momentum . to some",
    ", however , the term hbt refers only to identical - particle interferometry .",
    "following lednicky , we will employ the term _ femtoscopy _ @xcite to denote any measurement that provides spatio - temporal information , including coalescence analyses .",
    "femtoscopic measurements from truly relativistic heavy ion collisions were first reported almost twenty years ago . since then , measurements have been performed for collisions at energies spanning two orders of magnitude . in a double sense ,",
    "then , this review examines recent rhic results within the larger context of two decades worth of femtoscopy .",
    "the theory and phenomenology of correlation femtoscopy are reviewed in the next section , with particular emphasis on describing the approximations used to derive the connection between spatio - temporal aspects of the emission function and correlations constructed from final - state momenta .",
    "experimental methods and techniques are correspondingly reviewed in section [ sec : expbasics ] .",
    "section [ sec : systematics ] presents experimental results , with an emphasis on describing the systematics of source dimensions and lifetimes as a function of beam energy , system size , particle species and a particle s momentum .",
    "in addition to source dimensions , results for phase space density and entropy are presented .",
    "comparisons of experimental results and transport models are presented in section [ sec : interpretations ] , with an emphasis on explaining the `` hbt puzzle , '' i.e. , the fact that dynamic descriptions that incorporate a phase transition to a new state of matter with many degrees of freedom significantly over - predict observed source sizes .",

    "two - particle correlation functions are constructed as the ratio of the measured two - particle inclusive and single - particle inclusive spectra , @xmath4 the theoretical analysis of ( [ eq : formaldefinition ] ) aims at relating this experimentally measured correlation to the space - time structure of the particle emitting source @xcite .",
    "two forms are common for connecting the measured correlation function to the space - time emission function @xmath5 through a convolution with the wave function @xmath6 . in the first form @xcite , @xmath7 in calculations of two - particle correlation functions , the squared relative two - particle wave function @xmath8 serves generally as a weight , and the emission function @xmath5 contains all space - time information about the source because it describes the probability of emitting a particle with momentum @xmath9 from a space - time point @xmath10 . here , and throughout this section , primes denote quantities in the center - of - mass frame , i.e. , the frame where @xmath11 .",

    "it also emphasizes the limitation of correlation functions , that they can provide , at best , the function @xmath16 , the distribution of relative positions of particles with identical velocities and total momentum @xmath17 as they move in their asymptotic state .",
    "thus , correlations do not measure the size of the entire source .",
    "instead , they address the dimensions of the `` region of homogeneity , '' a term coined by sinyukov @xcite , i.e. , the size and shape of the phase space cloud of outgoing particles whose velocities have a specific magnitude and direction .",
    "if the collective expansion of the produced matter is strong , as is the case in central collisions , then the region of homogeneity is significantly smaller than the entire source volume . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the assumptions on which equations  [ eq : altmaster ] and  [ eq : master ] are based .",
    "we start from explicit expressions for the one- and two - particle spectra in terms of @xmath18-matrix elements . for one - particle emission , @xmath19 here , @xmath20 refers to the state of all other particles in the system .",
    "all interactions with the residual system are incorporated into the @xmath18 matrix . however , there is a choice as to whether mean - field interactions are included in the @xmath18 matrix or are instead incorporated into the evolution matrix @xcite .",
    "for example , one can include the coulomb interactions with the residual system by replacing the phase factor @xmath21 in equation  [ eq : p1tmatrix ] with an outgoing coulomb wave function",
    ". this can be quantitatively important , in particular for slow particles .",
    "it becomes difficult when the two particles interact with one another through the strong or coulomb force , as this represents a quantum three - body problem .",
    "_ assumption 1 : higher order ( anti)symmetrization can be neglected .",
    "_ equation  [ eq : p1tmatrix ] implies that all particles with asymptotic momentum @xmath9 must have had their last interaction with the source at some point @xmath10 .",
    "for distinguishable particles , this is indeed the case and equation  [ eq : p1tmatrix ] does not represent an assumption .",
    "however , if there are @xmath22 particles of the same type @xmath23 , then one must consider @xmath24 .",
    "the evolution matrix is then no longer a simple phase factor but includes @xmath25 interference terms .",
    "the single - particle probability is then obtained by integrating over the other @xmath26 momenta .",
    "this can be accomplished explicitly for simple source functions  @xcite .",
    "the distortion to the single - particle spectra and to the two - particle correlation function were found to be important when the phase space density approached unity . otherwise , equation  [ eq : p1tmatrix ] is well justified .",
    "_ assumption 2 : the emission process is initially uncorrelated . _ in writing equation  [ eq : p1tmatrix ] , one requires that two - particle matrix elements factorize , @xmath27 , i.e. , that the emission is independent . if multi - particle symmetrization can be neglected , the two - particle evolution operator factorizes into a center - of - mass and a relative operator .",
    "one has @xmath28 for non - identical particles , whereas for identical particles @xmath29 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : kopylov ] .",
    "then , the two - particle probability can be expressed in terms of one - particle source functions , @xmath30    schematic representation of the squared emission amplitude for two particles emitted independently from the grey - shaded source region and interacting with each other in the final states .",

    "the smoothness approximation replaces @xmath37 with either @xmath38 , which leads to equation  [ eq : master ] , or with @xmath39 , which leads to equation  [ eq : altmaster ] .",
    "if the first approximation is performed , one should also make the same approximation for the denominator .",
    "the smoothness approximation has been checked for expanding thermal sources , where it was found to be very reasonable for large ( rhic - like ) sources , but quite questionable for smaller sources such as those found in @xmath40 or @xmath41 collisions @xcite .",
    "_ assumption 4 : equal time approximation .",
    "_ for the general case where the evolution operator incorporates coulomb or strong interactions , deriving equations  [ eq : master ] and  [ eq : altmaster ] from equation  [ eq : intermediate ] is more complicated .",
    "first , the smoothness assumption amounts here to neglecting the @xmath32 dependence in the product of the source functions in equation  [ eq : intermediate ] .",
    "this assumption is somewhat more stringent in the presence of final state interactions because the relevant range of @xmath32 extends beyond @xmath35 . with this assumption ,",
    "one obtains a @xmath42-function constraint for @xmath33 , and the integrand of ( [ eq : intermediate ] ) is proportional to the squared evolution matrix @xmath43 .",
    "this evolution matrix has non - zero time components , which must be neglected if one is to identify it with the relative wave function .",
    "because the relative motion in the pair rest frame is small , one expects this approximation to be reasonable , but it has not yet been tested in model studies .    the above formalism is semi - classical in the sense that a quantum - mechanical particle emission probability , defined by the @xmath18-matrix elements , is usually approximated by classical source functions . as a consequence , quantum uncertainty limits the applicability of equations  [ eq : master ] and  [ eq : altmaster ] . to illustrate this limitation ,",
    "source functions have been evaluated by convoluting the emission function with wave packets@xcite of spatial width @xmath44 .",
    "this leads to a broadening of spatial distributions by @xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "because quantum smearing may already be incorporated into some of the semi - classical treatments through the choice of the initial density distribution , these calculations should be regarded as indicative of the theoretical uncertainty . because this error affects the size in quadrature , it is negligible for large sources , but might be significant for sources near 1 fm in size with strong space - time correlations  @xcite .",
    "in particular , analyses of @xmath47 correlations from @xmath41 collisions , which result in source sizes of less than 1.0 fm@xcite , are difficult to interpret in the above formalism .      in the absence of strong and electromagnetic final state interactions , the wave function of an identical particle pair in equation",
    "[ eq : master ] becomes @xmath48 the distribution of separations in coordinate space @xmath49 can then be determined by performing a three - dimensional fourier transform of @xmath50 .",
    "it is instructive to consider the properties of this inversion in more detail .",
    "the curvature of @xmath51 at @xmath52 can be related to the mean - square separation of the three - dimensional shape of @xmath53 ( we neglect the @xmath17 labels in @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) , @xmath56 this relation has been useful to qualitatively illustrate the relation between specific space - time information and specific features of the correlator .",
    "however , applying the identity quantitatively requires careful consideration of pions from longer - lived resonances which can dominate the calculation of @xmath57 if not accounted for .",
    "compared to the case for non - interacting identical particles , where the transformation between @xmath53 and @xmath58 is a fourier transform , analyzing the experimentally measured correlation function with equation  [ eq : master ] to determine the source function is more complicated .",
    "understanding the resolving power of the kernel @xmath59 requires a detailed understanding of the relative wave function .",
    "once one averages over spins , the squared relative wave function is a function of @xmath35 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in relativistic collisions ,",
    "correlation analyses are usually confined to light , singly charged hadrons .",
    "coulomb - induced correlations are then weak and must be analyzed at small @xmath35 , where quantum effects become important ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the relative two - particle wave function in the presence of coulomb interactions can then be written as a function of @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath65 where @xmath66 is the bohr radius , @xmath67 and @xmath68 . here , @xmath69 is independent of @xmath60 , and for small @xmath64 the correlation function behaves as the gamow factor , @xmath70 .",
    "thus , the coulomb kernels have little resolving power for @xmath47 correlations where @xmath71 fm , but have greater resolving power for @xmath72 correlations where @xmath73 fm .",

    "significant effort has been invested in `` correcting '' experimental correlation functions to remove coulomb effects to all orders , but such corrections are model - dependent . the safest method for determining the source function is either inverting the full kernel @xcite or fitting @xmath51 to some parameterized form for @xmath77 , which is convoluted with the full kernel .",
    "neither of these tactics are computationally prohibitive .",
    "strong interactions can also be exploited to provide size and shape information .",
    "if the size of the source is much larger than the range of the potential between the two particles , the kernel @xmath78 can be determined entirely from knowledge of the phase shifts .",
    "pairs that have a resonant interaction are especially useful , because the resonance will lead to a peak whose height is inversely proportional to the source volume , if @xmath79 . at small @xmath35 the kernel",
    "is determined by the scattering length , @xmath23 @xcite , and the height of the correlation at @xmath80 becomes @xmath81 where the averaging is performed using @xmath82 as a weight .",
    "of course , the effects of strong interactions , coulomb interference , and identical - particle interference can all combine as is the case for @xmath40 correlations .",
    "the @xmath40 kernel has been analyzed in depth by brown and danielewicz , where the kernel was inverted and applied to experimental @xmath40 data .",
    "evidence was seen for significant non - gaussian behavior in the resulting source functions @xcite .",
    "strong interactions also provide angular resolving power @xcite which can be understood from the perspective of classical trajectories .",
    "even @xmath83-wave scattering can be exploited to discern information about shape .",
    "strong and coulomb - induced correlations apply to both identical and non - identical particles . for non - identical particles ,",
    "the wave function is not symmetrized and @xmath84 , which results in odd components of the correlations function , @xmath85 if there are odd components of @xmath86 as is the case for non - identical particle pairs .",
    "this asymmetry can be experimentally exploited to investigate the spatio - temporal differences between the emission functions of different particle species @xcite ; this requires , however , sufficient statistics to select on the angle between the total and relative momentum in the pair center of mass @xmath87  @xcite .",
    "correlation functions depend on two three - dimensional momenta , @xmath17 and @xmath88 . for high - energy collisions ,",
    "analyses are usually performed in the longitudinally comoving system ( lcms ) , a rest frame moving along the longitudinal ( beam ) direction such that @xmath89 .",
    "axes are usually chosen according to the out - side - long prescription .",
    "the longitudinal axis is chosen parallel to the beam , while the outward axis points in the direction of @xmath17 , which is perpendicular to the beam axis .",
    "the sideward axis is chosen perpendicular to the other two .",
    "if the system is boost - invariant , observables expressed in the lcms variables are independent of @xmath90 and the source has a reflection symmetry about the @xmath91 plane . if the collision is central , there is also a reflection symmetry about the @xmath92 plane .",

    "dimensions of the source function are typically quoted in this coordinate system .",
    "one could also perform a second boost to the pair frame , in which the transverse components of the total momentum are zero",
    ". then , @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "relative wave functions are more conveniently expressed in the frame of the pair .",
    "for instance , a sharp resonant peak is no longer sharp if the correlation is viewed away from the pair frame . for pairs where the correlation is influenced by coulomb and strong interactions ,",
    "most analyses are conducted in the pair frame .    for non - zero impact parameters ,",
    "azimuthal symmetry is lost and source functions also depend on the azimuthal direction of the pair s total momentum @xcite . also , if boost - invariance is broken , the pair s rapidity needs to be specified . in this more general case ,",
    "reflection symmetries are broken and the choice of the coordinate axes becomes somewhat arbitrary .",
    "one could orient the axes according the event s impact parameter , or one could rotate the coordinate system so that in the new frame cross terms such as @xmath100 vanish ( illustrated in figure  [ fig : crossterm ] ) .",
    "one would then specify the euler angles as part of the description of the source function .",
    "to gain a physical understanding of the three - dimensional spatio - temporal source distribution , it is useful to summarize its size and shape with a few parameters .",
    "this motivates the study of gaussian parameterizations for the source @xmath101 and the two - particle correlator .",
    "realistic sources deviate from gaussians , e.g. by exponential tails caused by resonance decay contributions .",
    "the extracted gaussian source parameters may thus depend on details of the fitting procedures .",
    "these shortcomings can be overcome with imaging methods , or more complicated forms for the fitting .",
    "a more general three - dimensional analysis of correlations would involve decomposing both the correlation and source functions in either spherical or cartesian harmonics @xcite .",
    "although the detailed non - gaussian aspects of the correlation are important , the extra information can also cloud the main trends in the data . in practice ,",
    "gaussian parameterizations provide the standard minimal description of experimental data .",

    "reflection symmetries can be used to eliminate certain cross terms and some of the offsets @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "if the particles are identical or have the same phase space distributions , all the offsets can be set to zero .",
    "because the source function for the second species @xmath108 might also have 14 parameters , there could be up to 28 gaussian parameters in describing both @xmath12 and @xmath109 . however , because @xmath86 depends only on the distribution of relative spatial coordinates in the pair frame , only nine gaussian parameters are required to describe the most general @xmath110 for a given @xmath17 .",
    "three of these nine parameters can be identified with gaussian widths , three can be identified with offsets , and the last three can either be identified with cross terms or with the three euler angles describing the orientation of the three - dimensional ellipse .    using the reflection symmetries for mid - rapidity sources in a symmetric central collision ,",

    "certainly , this division is somewhat artificial , as there are non - gaussian tails , or halos @xcite , to @xmath172 due to such causes as the exponential fall - off of the source function in the longitudinal direction or semi - long - lived resonances such as the @xmath6 , whose lifetime is 40 fm / c . non - gaussian behavior is a subject for either imaging @xcite or for more complicated parameterizations .",

    "coherent states represent highly correlated emissions caused by phase coherence and thus violate the assumption of incoherence or uncorrelated emission implied by assumption 2 as described early in this section .",
    "the question of whether an observation of @xmath178 is due to coherence or due to contamination from particles from far outside the source volume can be tested by analyzing three - particle correlations @xcite .",
    "such analyses of data at both sps and rhic have been consistent with the incoherence conjecture @xcite .",

    "the gaussian lifetime @xmath180 described in equation  [ eq : emissionduration ] represents the spread of the emission times . a small value of @xmath180",
    "does not imply that particles were emitted early , but that they were emitted suddenly .",
    "inferring the mean time at which particles are emitted requires a different assumption .",
    "for instance , at rhic , the initial nuclei are lorentz contracted by a factor of 100 , and if there were no subsequent expansion , @xmath126 would be less than a fermi .",
    "if one assumes that the system expands along the beam axis with no longitudinal acceleration , the collective velocity becomes @xmath181 if emission then comes from sources moving over a large range of rapidities ( a boost - invariant expansion ) , the dimension along the beam axis for the source emitting zero - rapidity particles is determined by the distance one can move before the collective velocity overwhelms the thermal velocity to force the emission function back to zero .",
    "the size can then be expressed as : @xmath182 whereas @xmath137 gives information about the suddenness of emission , @xmath126 provides insight into the mean time at which emission occurs given an estimate of the thermal velocity .    for a thermal source with relativistic motion ,",
    "the thermal velocity along the beam axis is determined by the temperature and the transverse mass , @xmath183 @xcite . for large @xmath184",
    "the thermal velocity in the longitudinal direction becomes non - relativistic , @xmath185 , and the source size falls as @xmath186 which is referred to as @xmath184 scaling @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : rvsmt ] .",
    "however , this assumes all particles are emitted with the same bjorken time @xmath187 and temperature , independent of the transverse mass . because particles with high @xmath184 are probably emitted at lower @xmath187 , and because the temperature roughly behaves at @xmath188 , the longitudinal size could fall even more quickly than @xmath189 .     because particles with heavier masses have smaller thermal velocities , their source volumes are more strongly confined by collective flow . for longitudinal flow ( _ left panel _ ) this results in smaller values of @xmath126 for particles with higher @xmath183 . for radial flow ( _ right panel _ ) this confines heavier particles toward the surface , which results in both a reduced volume and an offset @xmath190 in the outward direction.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in a boost invariant expansion , emission is a function of the bjorken time @xmath191 , not the time @xmath117 , and because @xmath192 , those particles emitted with small @xmath193 have a head start .",
    "this is sometimes referred to as an inside - outside cascade .",
    "the transverse shape of @xmath77 is then affected non - trivially by the expansion along the beam .",
    "the resulting correlation function can be calculated analytically in the case of pure identical - particle correlations @xcite .",
    "boost invariance is incorporated into blast - wave models with transverse expansion and assumed for many hydrodynamic models .",
    "the finite size of the system would alter the results for two reasons .",
    "first , if the distribution of sources covers only a finite range in @xmath75 , the tails of the distribution @xmath86 are chopped off . assuming the distribution in @xmath75 is gaussian rather than uniform , @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the range of rapidities over which the sources are distributed .",
    "if @xmath195 were 1.5 units of rapidity , the extracted values of @xmath187 from boost - invariant pictures would be underestimating @xmath187 by @xmath196% .",
    "a second shortcoming of boost - invariant models is that they ignore acceleration in the longitudinal direction .",
    "accounting for this acceleration would alter the relation between the time and the velocity gradient .",
    "neglecting this acceleration could also lead to a modest underestimate of @xmath187  @xcite .      because transverse collective flow is intimately related to the pressure and viscosity ,",
    "it is of central importance .",
    "blast - wave models are based on pictures of thermal sources superimposed onto the transverse and longitudinal collective velocity profiles .",
    "simple forms are then chosen for the profiles .",
    "only two parameters are important for analyzing spectra , the temperature and the transverse velocity .",
    "because heavier particles are more sensitive to flow than are light particles , the two parameters can be adjusted to fit the spectra of several species .",
    "in addition to the temperature and transverse velocity , correlation measurements are also sensitive to the space - time parameters of the blast wave . in a minimal parameterization",
    "this would include the lifetime @xmath187 and the transverse size @xmath197 .",
    "more sophisticated models would also include a spread in lifetime @xmath198 and a surface diffuseness @xmath199 .",
    "additional parameters ensue when one considers sensitivity to the reaction plane .",
    "then , two parameters are needed to describe the transverse size , and two parameters are required to describe the transverse collective velocity .",
    "these parameters can then depend on the azimuthal direction of @xmath17 @xcite .    choosing a blast - wave parameterization involves a number of choices about the form of the parameterization @xcite .",
    "chemical potentials and temperatures might be chosen to vary with the transverse position @xmath60 @xcite or might be chosen to be uniform .",
    "a wide variety of parameterizations have been employed for the transverse velocity profile , which might choose linear profiles for either @xmath200 , @xmath201 or the transverse rapidity @xmath202 . in some parameterizations",
    ", the velocity profile has been chosen to rise quadratically with @xmath60 @xcite . although hydrodynamics has been invoked as justification for different parameterizations , profiles from hydrodynamics vary according to the equation of state .    for particles moving much faster than the surface velocity ,",
    "transverse flow manifests itself by constraining particles to an increasingly small fraction of the blast - wave volume for the same reason that @xmath126 falls with @xmath184 owing to longitudinal expansion @xcite . for large @xmath184",
    ", this leads to both @xmath125 and @xmath124 falling as @xmath186 @xcite .",
    "the fact that transverse dimensions fall with @xmath184 might also result from the dynamics of cooling , superimposed with a growing fireball .",
    "this correlates high - energy particles with earlier times when the fireball was both smaller and at a higher temperature .",
    "non - identical particles are of special interest in a blast - wave . for particles moving faster than the surface of the blast wave ,",
    "there is a stronger tendency for heavier particles to be more confined to the region of the surface owing to their slower thermal velocities @xcite .",
    "this results in heavy particles being ahead of lighter particles of the same asymptotic velocity , and leads to a non - zero @xmath203 illustrated in figure  [ fig : rvsmt ] . as discussed in section [ subsec : coulstrong ] , these displacements are accessible through measuring odd components of the correlation function @xcite .      any model that predicts final - state space - time and momentum information of emitted particles can be used to predict correlation functions .",
    "this information may be extracted from both microscopic simulations or from hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "microscopic simulations model the collision by evolving particles along straight - line classical trajectories which are punctuated by collisions that are programmed to be consistent with free - space cross - sections .",
    "when the modeling is done on a one - to - one basis , the simulations are referred to as cascades .",
    "boltzmann simulations are similar but employ an oversampling by a factor @xmath204 accompanied by a scaling down of the cross - sections by the same factor .",
    "these are then consistent with the boltzmann equation and become local and relativistically covariant in the large @xmath204 limit @xcite . to generate correlation functions from either class of simulation , there are essentially two methods which are equally justified within the smoothness approximation .",
    "method i is motivated by equation  [ eq : master ] .",
    "this involves first creating two lists , one for each species , of the space time coordinates @xmath205 and @xmath206 of all those particles that were emitted with momenta @xmath207 and @xmath208 . from these lists ,",
    "one generates @xmath53 by sampling the distributions of @xmath209 .",
    "this list is then convoluted with @xmath210 to generate @xmath58 for all @xmath211 . in method",
    "ii , one samples pairs randomly without regard to their momenta .",
    "the numerator of the correlation function is then calculated by generating pairs with the same weight as one expects to observe experimentally and applying a weight given by the square of the relative wave function .",
    "the denominator would be calculated in a similar manner , but without the weight from the wave function .",
    "this method reflects the description of the correlation function in equation  [ eq : altmaster ] .",
    "acceptance effects or kinematic cuts can then be performed exactly as they would be performed for real particles .",
    "method ii has an advantage in that it is easier to accurately incorporate acceptance effects or tight kinematic cuts .",
    "method i makes for a much quicker calculation because the procedure does not require sampling particles for irrelevant momenta @xcite .    given the equation of state and the initial energy density , hydrodynamics",
    "provides the means for solving for the space - time development of the stress - energy tensor which can be used to make predictions for correlations @xcite .",
    "viscous effects can also be incorporated and are non - negligible @xcite .",
    "generating source functions from the output of hydrodynamic calculations is not as straightforward as it might seem .",
    "the cooper - frye prescription @xcite conserves energy and momentum if the equation of state is one of free particles , but it suffers from the fact that the particles that cross backwards across the surface into the hydrodynamic volume enter the source function as a negative emission probability . if the relative velocity of the surface , as measured by an observer in the matter s rest frame , is not much faster than the thermal velocity , a different prescription is required .",
    "numerous prescriptions have been proposed to address these issues @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamic models , even those that incorporate viscosity , can not be justified once the system expands to the point that the mean free path is similar to the characteristic size of the system .",
    "however , boltzmann descriptions or cascades are well justified at lower densities .",
    "several efforts have thus focused on coupling the two approaches @xcite . because the final - state trajectories are established in the boltzmann part of the prescription",
    ", one can apply either of the methods mentioned above .      because phase space density depends on both the momentum @xmath212 and the position @xmath213",
    ", a measurement of the phase space density must specify the spatial region over which it is determined . in practice , spatial information from two - particle correlation functions is instrumental to this end .",
    "for identical particle pairs , the `` area '' under the correlation function determines the average phase space density @xcite .",

    "we note that @xmath216 is the phase space density averaged over coordinate space for a specific momentum using the phase space density itself as the weight .",
    "unless @xmath217 is a constant within a fixed volume , the average phase space density will fall below the maximum phase space density @xcite .",

    ", one can determine either @xmath230 or the gaussian parameters from ratios of spectra .",
    "@xmath231 coalescence analyses can provide powerful measurements of volumes , but they only provide a single number , @xmath232 , and they can not provide any insight into either the shape or the @xmath60 dependence .",
    "experimental techniques have developed considerably in response to significant improvements in both the theory and the quantity and quality of experimental data . in this section",
    "we discuss the general experimental approach for defining and analyzing femtoscopic correlations and their systematic dependence on global and kinematic quantities .      in practice ,",
    "the formal definition of the correlation function in equation  [ eq : formaldefinition ] is seldom used in heavy ion physics .",
    "instead the correlation of two particles , @xmath23 and @xmath108 for a given pair momentum @xmath17 and relative momentum @xmath88 , is nominally given by @xmath233 where @xmath234 is the signal distribution , @xmath235 is the reference or background distribution which is ideally similar to @xmath105 in all respects except for the presence of femtoscopic correlations , and @xmath236 is a correction factor introduced to compensate for non - femtoscopic correlations present in the signal that are not fully accounted for in the background as well as artifacts resulting , e.g. , from finite resolution and contamination .",
    "the signal @xmath234 refers to the relative momentum distribution of particles @xmath23 and @xmath108 for a given range of pair momenta , @xmath237 , and a given set of event characterizations .",
    "although not all analyses proceed in exactly the following fashion , the mechanics of constructing the signal and background are most easily understood if one considers as separate steps :    1 .",
    "event quality cuts and event - class binning ; 2 .",
    "single - track ( including particle identification ) cuts and single - particle binning ; and 3 .",
    "two - particle pairing , two - track cuts , and pair momenta binning .",
    "here the term event class refers to both physics observables , such as collision centrality and reaction plane orientation , and detector considerations , such as event vertex position and the condition of the detector when the event was recorded , usually keyed by run number .",
    "the latter considerations are relevant to the proper construction of the background . for event - class ,",
    "particle , and pair bin , the final signal is usually stored as a set of 3d - histograms in the canonical relative momentum variables .",
    "single - particle acceptances divide out with a properly constructed background , but 2-track acceptances can have a large effect on the correlation function .",
    "for this reason the analysis of 2-track cuts is the dominant consideration in the signal construction for most analyses .",
    "the cuts and terminology are different for time projection chamber ( tpc ) experiments with near continuous hit distributions and drift chamber experiments with projective geometry , but the goals are the same .",
    "split - tracks  @xcite and ghost - tracks both refer to single tracks which are incorrectly reconstructed as a pair of tracks with very low relative momenta .",
    "even after the event - reconstruction algorithms ( which generate a list of individual tracks ) have been optimally tuned , small traces of these false pairs remain and must be removed from the analysis with identical pairwise cuts .",
    "usually only a tiny fraction of tracks are split , and this effect may be ignored in essentially all experimental analyses except femtoscopic ones .",
    "various methods have been developed for identifying likely split tracks , usually based on the number  @xcite or topology  @xcite of space - points associated with the track .",
    "pairwise effects usually also result in the loss of pairs at low relative momentum , because two tracks with very similar trajectories tend to be reconstructed as a single track .",
    "( note that in tracking detectors , this is not a problem if one or both of the particles is a topologically identified neutral particle . in that case",
    ", the decay daughters may be well - separated even if their parents have identical momentum . )",
    "such merging issues are usually resolved by pairwise cuts that remove merged pairs .",
    "developing efficient and appropriate cuts can be a subtle exercise , and it requires good knowledge of the detector and event reconstruction software . in most cases these cuts are supported by simulations , but final determinations are nearly always based upon data .",
    "what does it mean to cut out merged pairs ?",
    "after all , if the tracks have merged , then the pair is lost anyway .",
    "the point is twofold .",
    "first , the pair efficiency usually does not drop from 100% to 0% sharply as a function of any variable .",
    "thus , the cuts are usually tuned to exclude all  @xcite or most  @xcite of the inefficient region .",
    "if regions with less than perfect efficiency remain in the analysis , a 2-track efficiency correction based on monte carlo simulations must be applied , typically leading to systematic uncertainties of a few percent .",
    "the second reason for the cut is that it is applied equally to the signal and to the background distribution @xmath238  @xcite .",
    "thus , if some fraction @xmath175 of pairs is lost at some relative momentum @xmath88 in @xmath239 , the same fraction is lost in @xmath240 , and the ratio in equation  [ eq : experimentaldefinition ] is robust against the effect .      for reasons described above",
    ", all cut - imposed effects on the signal pair distribution @xmath241 must be applied to @xmath242 .",
    "this often means identifying which pairs would have been removed by merging , splitting , or other cuts , had the particles come from in the same event",
    ".    the ideal background should be identical to the signal in all respects except for the presence of femtoscopic correlations .",
    "therefore , the global event characteristics , single particle distributions , and acceptances should match those of the signal . a simple and straightforward way to construct such",
    "a background is to form pairs from different events within a single event class .",
    "this event - mixing technique  @xcite has gained wide acceptance in relativistic heavy - ion collisions where violations to energy - momentum conservation are negligible in the high multiplicity environment .",
    "this technique will be described in detail in what follows .",
    "however , other methods have also been used , especially if one considers femtoscopy in other systems .",
    "for elementary - particle collisions or in low - multiplicity events , event mixing can violate total energy - momentum conservation , especially when exclusive final states or jet - axes must be preserved ; thus , the correlation function would reflect non - femtoscopic in addition to femtoscopic correlations . in these cases ,",
    "the most common techniques form a background from unlike - signed pairs , with resonance regions excluded with cuts  @xcite or normalized with a correlation of like- to unlike - signed pairs from a monte carlo  @xcite .",
    "other experiments have constructed a background using only monte carlo generated pairs  @xcite .",
    "a few experiments have investigated backgrounds formed by swapping  @xcite or reversing momentum components relative to a jet - axis  @xcite , but these methods are not widely used . for detectors with symmetrical acceptance , such as the star tpc  @xcite , momentum conservation effects may be eliminated by mixing pairs from the same event , with the lab momentum of one particle flipped  @xcite .",
    "backgrounds constructed from single - particle distributions as formally defined by equation  [ eq : formaldefinition ] have been used for heavy ion collisions at lower energies and shown to be consistent with the more commonly used event - mixing technique  @xcite .    in order to avoid inducing artificial structure in the correlation function",
    ", the particles forming pairs in the background distribution should originate from parent events with the same event characteristics .",
    "the parent events should have similar vertex positions to within the experimental resolution . because detector acceptances can vary with time ( e.g.",
    ", components may fail for some runs ) , parent events should have been measured close in time to each other ; this is usually easiest in any case , because event mixing is done on the fly as time - ordered data is read sequentially .",
    "parent events whose particles are mixed should also have the same single - particle momentum distributions .",
    "thus , they should have similar centralities and orientations of the reaction plane .",
    "for example , mixing particles from events with very different @xmath1 slopes or directions of preferred emission ( elliptic flow ) would produce differences between @xmath243 and @xmath244 even in the absence of physical correlations . because almost all analyses to date have ignored these potential biases , it is comforting that they make little difference in practice  @xcite .",
    "the list of event classes given here is by no means exhaustive .",
    "one can expect future analyses to incorporate the orientation of high @xmath1 particles ( jet axis ) or any other event - related observable .",
    "the procedure for deciding how many events to mix remains something of an art and involves optimizing over the range of data runs , bin width , and statistics . in order to minimize statistical errors ,",
    "one typically forms approximately ten times the number of pairs in the background as in the signal . for the special case",
    "when all possible combinations are formed , the variance of a particular relative momentum bin is proportional to @xmath245 , where @xmath246 is the number of entries in the bin  @xcite .",
    "however , as the number of pairs formed is reduced , the variance per bin approaches the @xmath247 value expected for poisson statistics",
    "it is possible that non - poisson fluctuations persist in the co - variance between different bins , but this has not yet been investigated .",
    "once the pairs have been mixed , the background must be subject to the same 2-track cuts that have been applied to the signal .",
    "for example , the exact same track merging cuts or minimum separation on a detector must be applied to both signal and background .",
    "corrections to the correlation function fall into three categories : finite resolution effects , mis - identified particle contamination , and compensation for deficiencies in the background .",
    "the first category concerns single - track momentum resolution , and reaction - plane resolution .",
    "we consider finite momentum resolution corrections first . typically , momentum resolutions are on the order of 1% .",
    "one approach is to correct for momentum resolution by a double ratio of the ideal correlation function generated from a monte carlo simulation with perfect momentum resolution divided by a monte carlo correlation function with momentum resolution turned on .",
    "the femtoscopic weights are inserted into the simulations iteratively until the fitted radii converge  @xcite .",
    "a second approach is similar , but corrects only the coulomb interaction term , which is most greatly affected by momentum resolution effects  @xcite . in both cases , the corrections change the fitted radii by only @xmath2485% .    as discussed in section  [ sec : systematics - phi ] , azimuthally sensitive analyses  @xcite measure oscillations in correlations as a function of emission angle with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "finite resolution effects in the reaction plane angle  @xcite artificially reduce the oscillation strengths .",
    "methods have been developed to correct the distributions @xmath243 and @xmath244 for these effects  @xcite .",
    "another type of correction accounts for the inclusion of mis - identified and secondary - particle contamination .",
    "for example , electrons may be mistakenly identified as @xmath249 mesons .",
    "it is usually assumed that the mis - identified or secondary particles are uncorrelated with other particles , so the net effect on the correlation function is to damp all structure uniformly in @xmath88 .",
    "for purely gaussian correlations ( see section  [ sec : fitting ] ) , this effect is absorbed wholly into the @xmath169 factor discussed in section  [ sec : lambda ] ; homogeneity lengths  derived from the width of the gaussian correlation  are unaffected by the reduction in its strength . in many cases ,",
    "however , the homogeneity length is extracted largely from the strength of the correlation , and so contamination effects must be removed . in the general case ,",
    "for which the purity @xmath250 depends on the relative momentum , the correlation function is corrected according to @xmath251  @xcite .",
    "it is more difficult to correct for correlated contamination .",
    "for example , if cuts can not completely distinguish primary protons from those coming from @xmath252 decay , then measured @xmath253 correlations will contain contributions from @xmath254 correlations .",
    "unlike the white - noise contamination discussed above , this introduces structure into @xmath255 that can be accounted for only with detailed simulations .",
    "such corrections will become more important at rhic due to copious resonance production , and especially for baryon correlation measurements , in which the heavy daughter carries most of the momentum of the parent resonance .",
    "the last category of corrections are applied to fix deficiencies in the background distribution .",
    "this includes corrections to account for two - particle inefficiencies , which have been discussed in the previous section .",
    "a second correction of this type deals with the residual signal correlation that is present in all backgrounds derived from events that contribute to the signal .",
    "the residual correlation arises because femtoscopic correlations can modify the single particle distributions .",
    "this is especially true for small - aperture spectrometers .",
    "this effect can be removed with an iterative procedure  @xcite , however , for many large experiments the induced error is often 1% or less , and it is easier to fold this into the systematic errors  @xcite .      after the application of all cuts and corrections ,",
    "the correlation is formed according to equation  [ eq : experimentaldefinition ] and then fit to determine spatial parameters . as described in section  [ sec : theorybasics ] , there are three approaches to fitting the correlation function : fitting to a simplified gaussian form with strong and coulomb interactions neglected or factored out , fitting to a convolution of the full kernel convoluted to a parameterization of @xmath86 , and inverting the kernel to fit a source image .",
    "the simplified gaussian fits based on equation  [ eq : c2gauss ] are limited to correlations of identical pions , kaons , and photons , but it has been the most widely used method to date because of the computational demands of the other methods .",
    "we expect its use to continue for the large systematic studies in which binning in centrality , reaction plane , and @xmath256 leads to fits of more than one hundred separate correlation functions for a single colliding system .",
    "however , the functional form of the gaussian parameterization used by experimentalists has evolved over the years . before reviewing the most recent functional forms , it is necessary to review the treatment of the coulomb interaction and the fraction of pairs coming from the source that contribute to the femtoscopic correlations .",
    "both were first introduced into the literature by zajc  @xcite in the form of the gamow factor given in section  [ sec : theorybasics ] and an empirical parameter @xmath169 to account for the observation that not all pairs exhibit femtoscopic correlations . with steady improvements in data quality and cpu speed ,",
    "the gamow factor has been replaced with a calculation of an squared unsymmetrized coulomb wave for a finite gaussian source .",
    "the improvements in data quality have also led to a self - consistent treatment of @xmath169 with respect to both coulomb and gaussian components of the fit function  @xcite .",
    "for this to be accurate , we must assume that the source is fully chaotic , an assumption that has recently been verified with three - pion correlations  @xcite .",

    "kinematic and mass dependences of femtoscopic measurements showed the expected clear signatures of strong collective flow in the beam direction and perpendicular to it .    at a generic level ( ignoring quantitative predictions ) , we are first given pause at the jejune nature of the @xmath270-dependence of femtoscopic parameters .",
    "the most common example discussed is the pion source radii excitation function shown in figure  [ fig : hbtexcitation ] . in section  [ sec : systematics ] we explored the trends in considerably greater detail , but the figure conveys the right message : scanning @xmath270 through a range of two orders of magnitude changes final - state geometry little .",
    "based on rather generic arguments of soft points in the equation of state or entropy generation during a phase transition , there had been hopes for non - trivial structure in the excitation function , as the energy threshold for quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) creation was crossed  @xcite .",
    "general expectations were for long ( relative to the explosion of a purely hadronic system ) system evolution time scales if qgp was formed .",
    "blast - wave analyses of data  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) appear to rule out systems with lifetimes in the neighborhood of 20  fm / c or higher .",
    "however , owing to dynamic effects , careful comparison with a dynamical model is required to extract detailed evolution information ; this is discussed in section  [ subsec : dynamicmodels ] .    as discussed in section 4.1 , the weak increase with of the femtoscopic radii for central collisions shown in figure 13",
    "is mostly due simply to increasing multiplicity .",
    "the ceres collaboration  @xcite . has suggested that this increase may be understood in terms of an energy - independent mean free path of 1 fm at freeze - out .",
    "interestingly , this explanation also appears to describe the decrease of radii with @xmath338 , when the different cross - sections and abundances of pions and protons are accounted for .",
    "this observation emphasizes the importance of chemistry in the determination of the freeze - out geometry .",
    "however , it neglects the dynamical structure of the source ( e.g. , flow ) and the importance of the six - dimensional phase space density discussed in section 2.9 .",
    "we discuss this fundamental quantity next .",
    "as shown in section  [ subsec : psdentropy ] , average phase space densities , @xmath216 , can be calculated by combining source - size measurements with spectra .",
    "pionic phase space densities have been estimated for 130@xmath105 gev collisions at rhic @xcite , at the top sps energies , and for several ags energies @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : psd ] shows results for all three regions . in each case , the phase space densities were calculated via equation  [ eq : fbargauss ] . for the sps case ,",
    "results were generated by applying equation  [ eq : fbargauss ] to published spectra @xcite and source - size measurements @xcite .",
    "we note that our calculations for the sps are higher than previously published values at low @xmath339 @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is likely due to the fact that in reference @xcite , analytic parameterizations were used that differ significantly from published spectra at low @xmath339 .",
    "when applying equation  [ eq : fbargauss ] , an issue arises as to whether one should subtract the contribution from resonances to the spectra .",
    "indeed , if the pions are created by decays so far outside the source volume that they do not contribute to the correlation function , they should not be considered as pions when calculating the phase space density .",
    "there are two strategies to correct for such pions .",
    "first , one could use spectra where such particles are subtracted and apply equation  [ eq : fbargauss ] literally . as a second option",
    ", one could use the spectra without subtractions , but then multiply the expression for @xmath223 by @xmath340 . because most published spectra have been purged of the products of weak decays ,",
    "the first method is usually applied . however , published spectra still include the contribution from @xmath75 s , which decay thousands of fm away from the source .",
    "the @xmath75 contribution was accounted for in the sps calculation for figure  [ fig : psd ] by reducing the spectra by 5% .",
    "the phase - space densities in figure  [ fig : psd ] show a steady rise with beam energy that seems to plateau at sps energies .",
    "because the displayed phase space densities have been averaged over coordinate space , the peak values are higher @xcite , by a factor of @xmath341 , if the spatial profiles are gaussian . for a breakup temperature of 110 mev ,",
    "this requires a rather high chemical potential , near or above 80 mev @xcite",
    ".    ratios of particle yields are consistent with chemical freeze - out at temperatures near 170 mev @xcite .",
    "this suggests an interpretation where at higher densities the system is so strongly interacting that yields equilibrate until the system reaches this temperature and are then frozen during the subsequent freeze - out . at ags energies ,",
    "the increase in pion production brought on by increased beam energy results in more pions being pushed into a given amount of phase space as realized in figure  [ fig : psd ] by the rising phase space density .",
    "however , one would expect that as the excitation energy surpasses the threshold for a 170 mev temperature , the phase space density would reach a limiting value . because the average phase space density is preserved in an isentropic expansion with fixed particle number ( not exactly true if several masses are mixed together )",
    ", one would expect phase space densities to saturate once energy densities reached this value .",
    "indeed , the behavior in figure  [ fig : psd ] is consistent with this scenario .",
    "as shown in section  [ subsec : psdentropy ] , entropy can be calculated from average phase space densities using equation  [ eq : dsdy ] .",
    "spectra and source - size measurements for baryons and mesons were used to estimate phase space densities and entropy for 130@xmath105 gev au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "the total entropy in the central unit of rapidity was estimated at @xmath342 @xcite . in a hydrodynamic expansion ,",
    "entropy is conserved though viscosity , and shock waves might result in a roughly 10% increase during the evolution .",
    "thus , this measurement provides an upper bound for the entropy at @xmath343 fm / c when thermalization first occurs . at @xmath344 fm / c",
    ", the volume for particles in this rapidity slice is determined by the geometric cross - sectional areas of the overlapping gold nuclei multiplied by @xmath345 , thus an upper bound for the entropy density can be determined @xmath346 . knowing the energy density at @xmath344 fm / c",
    "would then provide a point in the equation of state , @xmath83 vs. @xmath347 .",
    "the value of @xmath348 estimated in @xcite is consistent with lattice calculations if @xmath349 gev/@xmath350 .",
    "estimates of the original energy density from the final - state measurement of @xmath351 are in the range of 4.5 gev/@xmath350 @xcite , but because these estimates neglect losses from longitudinal work or the energy from longitudinal thermal motion , the 7 gev/@xmath350 value seems reasonable .",
    "it is increasingly recognized that the comparison of dynamic models of heavy ion collisions to data is only insightful if it involves a sufficiently large variety of experimental data .",
    "a comparison of dynamic models to femtoscopic measurements alone ( or to any other class of measurements alone ) is of limited value , simply because for realistic models , the number of possible model - dependent parameter choices then tends to exceed the number of experimental constraints .",
    "in fact , all the model results that we review in the current subsection remain unsatisfactory with this respect : they either deviate significantly from femtoscopic data , or they reproduce these data at the price of missing other important experimental information . in particular , there is so far no dynamically consistent model that reproduces quantitatively both the systematic trends discussed in section 4 and the corresponding single inclusive spectra . in this situation , the scope of this subsection is somewhat limited .",
    "we want to explain why a dynamical understanding of femtoscopic measurements is important .",
    "we shall also discuss the key physics input that enters current attempts of dynamic modeling and the uncertainties resulting from it .",
    "however , we shall try to bypass as far as possible model - dependent details and rather focus on the question of which qualitative changes in the underlying dynamics result in characteristic changes of femtoscopic data .",
    "correlation measurements provide a snapshot of the geometrical distribution of particles at the time they decouple from the reaction .",
    "this geometrical distribution provides a unique test of the dynamical evolution of the produced matter at the late stage . because the spatial extension , dynamical evolution , and lifetime of the produced system determines phase space density and thus particle reaction rates , any dynamic model for the latter has to be consistent with femtoscopic information .",
    "so far , correlation analyses have focused mainly on boltzmann ( or cascade ) models , on hydrodynamic models , or on combinations of both ( hybrid models ) .",
    "these model classes correspond to rather different equations of state .",
    "the equations of state represented by cascade models tend to be stiff unless they incorporate large number of resonant scatterings .",
    "if particles collide via @xmath352 processes where the intermediate state has a finite lifetime , the equation of state can be softened @xcite .",
    "a prominent example of a cascade model is rqmd @xcite , relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ; it is the only one which has been compared to data at ags , sps , and rhic .",
    "results for rqmd are shown in figure  [ fig : hbtexcitation ] . however , for rhic energies , the dynamic consistency of rqmd is questionable because for most of its evolution , the model uses hadronic degrees of freedom , although rqmd simulations for rhic yield an energy density which stays above that of normal nuclear matter for a significant duration ( @xmath353 fm / c ) .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : models_transport ] , rqmd , which models the expansion as a hadronic cascade , overpredicts @xmath124 and @xmath126 at rhic despite the fact that it underpredicts multiplicities . another hadron cascade model , the hadronic rescattering model @xcite , based solely on hadronic rescattering with sudden collisions , gives smaller sources , which come closer to the data .",
    "part of the difference between the two hadronic cascades may derive from rqmd s treatment of scatterings as resonant interactions with finite lifetimes , which differs from the instantaneous collisions employed in the hadronic scattering model .",
    "figure  [ fig : models_transport ] also displays results for molnar s parton cascase ( mpc ) @xcite , which aims to provide a transparent partonic toy model by modeling the collision of light partons which undergo a one - to - one hadronization to pions .",
    "mpc , which has only instantaneous two - to - two scatterings , should have the stiffest effective equation of state and underestimates the source radii .    on of the most complicated transport codes available",
    "is a multi - phase transport ( ampt ) model .",
    "ampt @xcite aims at a realistic description of all aspects of the reaction dynamics and includes a partonic cascade coupled to a hadronic cascade employing a full list of resonant interactions .",
    "ampt provides a good fit to experimental radii , though the @xmath256 fall - off is stronger than that found in the data , which fall off @xmath354 .",
    "the more rapid decrease of radius parameters with respect to @xmath256 may be due to the continuous surface - like emission characteristic of microscopic models , which when combined with cooling gives a higher relative weight for high - energy particles to have been emitted earlier in time , before the reaction volume has reached its full spatial extent .",
    "any modification that would reduce this type of emission should improve agreement with data .",
    "cautiously , one would conclude that the results in figure  [ fig : models_transport ] favor models with a stiff , but not too stiff , equation of state and no latent heat .",
    "pion radius parameters from four boltzmann / cascade models are compared to experimental rhic data . for molnar",
    "s parton cascase calculations , the reported radii are simply space - time variances . for the other models , radii are obtained from gaussian fits to correlation functions generated according to the methods described in section 2.8 .",
    "measured data for positive and negative pions are indicated by closed and open symbols , respectively.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    this conclusion is further supported if one compares the results of cascade models with those of hydrodynamic simulations or hybrid models .",
    "figure  [ fig : models_hydro ] compares results from rhic to a three - dimensional hydrodynamic model of hirano  et al .",
    "@xcite that investigates the effects of resonance decays on chemical composition , the two - dimensional model of heinz and kolb  @xcite , and a two - dimensional chiral model by zseische  et al .",
    "@xcite that performs calculations for both first order and cross - over transitions . in all cases ,",
    "the more favorable calculations are compared with the data : partial chemical freeze - out for hirano , and cross - over transition for zschiesche , but large discrepancies between the models and the data still remain .",
    "the results from zseische were taken from the cross - over transition for the lowest critical temperature , 80 mev .",
    "substituting a first order phase transition or increasing the critical temperature to 130 mev increased the value of @xmath124 relative to @xmath125 , thereby increasing the differences with the data .",
    "hirano also reported a calculation under complete chemical equilibrium at freeze - out ; this improves the agreement with v@xmath355 , but at the expense of a much larger value of @xmath124/@xmath125 .",
    "in general , these models invoke equations of state that are typically softer than those used in cascades and boltzmann calculations , and they often have latent heats to accompany the transition from the partonic phase . as a consequence , lifetime and emission duration of the produced matter are significantly larger than what one finds in cascade models , and such models often significantly over - predict @xmath126 and @xmath356 .",
    "the fact that @xmath125 comes out smaller than the data in figure [ fig : models_hydro ] is mainly due to an attempt to compensate within the available model - parameter range the very large time - scales as much as possible .",
    "purely hydrodynamic models can vary overall source volumes by adjusting the break - up criteria , but doing so can make it difficult to fit the three source dimensions , and their @xmath184 dependence , as well as other observables .",
    "several prescriptions have been applied to improve the modeling of the breakup in the late stage to depend on microscopic considerations determined by free - space cross - sections without having an extra adjustable parameter , e.g. break - up density , @xcite .",
    "an alternative to improve the description of breakup is the use of hybrid models , in which hydrodynamic evolution in the early stage is combined with cascading in the late stage . in figure",
    "[ fig : models_hydro ] , we compare results of one such hybrid model , ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd )  @xcite , to results of hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "similar results were obtained by teaney et al .",
    "@xcite . compared to hydrodynamic simulations",
    ", hybrid descriptions do not seem to notably reduce the overpredicted lifetimes .",
    "they tend to emit most of the pions at a time near or above 15 fm / c and significantly overpredict @xmath137 ratios , whereas blast - wave parameterizations favor breakup times near or slightly below 10 fm / c .",
    "however , firm conclusions that the relative failure of hybrid models derives from the chosen equations of state can not be made until comparisons are made between boltzmann and hybrid calculations that use the same equation of state .",
    "until such an analysis is performed , other issues will cloud the interpretation , such as whether viscous effects or details of the hydrodynamic / boltzmann interface dominate results and might even invalidate the hydrodynamic approach .",
    "hydrodynamic ( zschiesche , hirano , and kolb ) and hybrid hydrodynamic / cascade ( soff ) models calculations in comparison to rhic data .",
    "data are for 2@xmath249(open symbols ) and 2@xmath357(closed symbols ) source radii.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    entropy and pressure are intimately related , in that knowing the entropy density as a function of the energy density determines the pressure as a function of energy density . whereas one can intuitively understand why a lower pressure would lead to longer lifetimes and larger source dimensions , the manifestations of changing the entropy are less transparent .",
    "one way to understand the effects of changing the entropy is to associate higher entropy with a larger effective number of light degrees of freedom .",
    "for instance , if one were to hadronize via a one - to - one parton - to - pion scheme , the volume per identical particle would change by a factor of the number of degrees of freedom . if the r.m.s .",
    "momentum is the same before and after hadronization , this would imply a change in entropy per particle equal to the logarithm of the ratio of effective degrees of freedom , and if @xmath358 light partonic degrees of freedom were immediately replaced by three pionic degrees of freedom , the system would lose @xmath359 units of entropy per particle .",
    "to conserve entropy , a system must expand its volume by a similar ratio which implies an increase in radius parameters .",
    "hydrodynamic models , which manifestly conserve entropy , use the energy stored in the latent heat to provide the heat necessary to preserve entropy during hadronization .",
    "entropy conservation is more difficult to enforce in microscopic approaches .",
    "this underlines the challenges involved in applying microscopic simulations in an environment of strongly interacting matter with ill - defined degrees of freedom , and it re - emphasizes the importance of gaining a better understanding of the validity of hydrodynamic calculations in such manifestly finite situations .",
    "it is peculiar that the entropy extracted from source - size and spectral measurements is consistent with the lattice - inspired equation of state @xcite , whereas the source sizes extracted from hybrid models incorporating similar equations of state significantly overpredict source sizes .",
    "part of this contradiction can be explained by increases in the populations of baryons , which , because they inherently have more entropy per particle than do pions , can account for much of the missing entropy @xcite .",
    "thus , the hbt puzzle does not necessarily imply an entropy puzzle .",
    "the hbt puzzle is not so much that radius parameters can not be fit by models , but that our most sophisticated models , which incorporate a phase transition , fail to reproduce the data .",
    "the very gradual evolution of extracted source sizes as beam energies traverse a large range of energies is remarkable and puzzling in its own right .",
    "a simple explanation is that the equations of state do not dramatically change as the energy density changes from hadronic to super - hadronic densities , i.e. , there is not even a hint of a latent heat . in fact , the failure of hydrodynamical models to reproduce femtoscopic measurements might be largely due to unrealistically large latent heats needed to reproduce elliptic flow data  @xcite .",
    "however , as emphasized above , a host of unresolved issues prevent more quantitative conclusions .",
    "these qualifiers can not be lifted until much more thorough analyses of models are performed that entail a systematic exploration of the sensitivity of model predictions to both parameters and assumptions .",
    "this would necessitate a tremendous commitment from the community , but without it , many conclusions about the matter created in relativistic heavy ion collisions will remain vague .",
    "twenty - five years ago , the goal of femtoscopy was to demonstrate that one could measure a hadronic length scale with correlations , and if a result was on the order of a few fermi , the analysis was deemed a success . in contrast , with the improved accuracy of measurements , the enormous increase in statistics , and the simultaneous development of phenomenology and theory , femtoscopy is now considered a precision measurement .",
    "ten percent deviations between theory and experiment are now taken seriously as evidence that the spatio - temporal description of a model is significantly flawed . at rhic energies ,",
    "all six dimensions of the correlation function have been exploited to provide truly three - dimensional insight into the phase space cloud for particles of any momentum with any direction .    for relativistic heavy ion collisions ,",
    "there were expectations that a transition from hadronic to partonic matter might be accompanied by a large latent heat , which would bring about a dramatic change in the dynamics as beam energies traversed the range for exploring the mixed phase . within this range",
    ", it was expected that the latent heat and the associated softening of the equation of state would manifest itself by slowing the explosion with lifetimes approaching or exceeding 20 fm / c .",
    "the signal of the phase transition would have been an increase of the effective lifetime for a range of beam energies followed by a return to more explosive and shorter - lived reactions at even higher energies",
    ".    extended lifetimes were not observed .",
    "increasing beam energies from ags to rhic indeed causes larger energy densities and higher multiplicities , which push toward increasing the source volumes",
    ". however , much of this increase in multiplicities is absorbed by higher phase space densities rather than larger source sizes .",
    "combined with the increasing strength of radial flow , which provides smaller regions of homogeneity relative to the overall source volume , the result is that the effective dimensions change remarkably little over a wide range of beam energies .",
    "furthermore , it appears that lifetimes of the reaction never leave the neighborhood of 10 fm / c .",
    "not only does this represent a lack of evidence for a latent heat , it also suggests that there is no such latent heat .",
    "these conclusions remain only modestly guarded .",
    "theory and phenomenology are progressing , but improvements in such aspects as mean - field effects or accounting for the smoothness approximation are not expected to change conclusions by more than 10% . as with the improvements in including coulomb effects in section [ sec : systematics ] , removing some of the distortions and aberrations from the analyses is likely to be significant for fine - tuning models , but should not alter the conclusion that there is no large latent heat associated with the reaction .    the theory of modeling , i.e. , generating the source functions , has the greatest need for progress . because femtoscopic measurements are determined solely by the geometry of breakup , changes in chemical or kinetic evolution may have a significant impact on extracted source dimensions . the next generation of transport theories should be more flexible and will probably incorporate numerous effects such as in - medium mass changes , in - medium reduction of scattering cross - sections , viscous effects , and dynamical solutions for chemical rates .    despite the progress listed above ,",
    "measurement has only begun to address the rich expanse of information available in correlations .",
    "nearly all the three - dimensional analyses have been focused on identical - pion correlations .",
    "the huge data sets of the recent and upcoming runs at rhic make it possible to analyze source functions for many pairs of particles in six full dimensions .",
    "in addition to providing important verification of identical - pion measurements , these analyses address other issues , such as whether all species flow and break up together .",
    "this is not a field for the complacent . as emphasized above",
    ", efforts at rhic are just beginning to explore wholly new classes of correlations .",
    "energy densities at the lhc might surpass those at rhic by the same factor that those at rhic surpassed the ags .",
