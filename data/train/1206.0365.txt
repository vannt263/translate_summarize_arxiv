    "@xcite reported results from decaying laser shock wave experiments which provided evidence of a liquid - liquid phase transition in mgsio@xmath0 at megabar pressures .",
    "the authors measured a reversal in the shock velocity and thermal emission and interpreted their findings in terms of a liquid - liquid phase transition that occurs when the sample changes from a high density to a low density fluid state during shock decay .",
    "decaying shock experiments are a new experimental technique that allows one to map out a whole segment of the hugoniot curve with a single shock wave experiment .",
    "first - principles computer simulations have a long tradition of characterizing materials at extreme pressures  @xcite and temperatures  @xcite and of contributing to the interpretation of shock wave experiments  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this particular paper is to perform density functional molecular dynamics simulations ( dft - md ) of dense liquids  @xcite in order to verify the predictions of a liquid - liquid phase transition by spaulding _",
    "et al . _",
    "first order transitions in liquids are unusual but have been seen in experiments on phosphorus and in simulations of dense hydrogen  @xcite .",
    "all simulations were performed with the vasp code  @xcite with pseudopotentials of the projector - augmented wave type  @xcite , a cut - off for the expansion of the plane wave basis set for the wave functions of 500  ev , and the pbe exchange - correlation functional  @xcite .",
    "the brillioun zone was only sampled with the @xmath2 point to allow for extended and efficient md simulations .",
    "our simulations lasted between 1 and 20 ps and used a small time step of 0.2 fs .",
    "the electronic states were populated according to the mermin functional  @xcite .",
    "we used an orthorhombic supercell with 60 atoms that we constructed by tripling the unit cell of the post - perovskite ( ppv ) structure that we relaxed at 120 gpa .",
    "the system was heated and melted using a nos thermostat .",
    "we then explored the liquid state by scaling the velocities and changing the density accordingly .",
    "we also performed heat - until - it - melts simulations with 60 atoms starting a perfect ppv crystal at hydrostatic conditions .",
    "we then gradually increased the temperature in a fixed cell geometry .",
    "we also performed a large number of solid simulations at constant temperature and different densities .",
    "dft - md simulations , respectively .",
    "the thin black dashed lines show the @xmath3-@xmath4 paths of the solid portions of our heat - until - it - melts simulations .",
    "the computed solid and liquid shock hugoniot curves are shown in blue and red color corresponding to initial densities of 3.22 and 2.74 @xmath5g@xmath5@xmath6 to match those of the single crystal ( blue ) and glass ( red ) materials used in the experiments  @xcite .",
    "the hugoniot curves are repeated in black and white on the right for comparison with the decaying shock measurements  @xcite . from the discontinuities in the experimental hugoniot curves ,",
    "the phase boundary between a high and low density liquid was inferred ( dash - dotted line ) .",

    "three earlier predictions of the melting line are included  @xcite .",

    "the @xmath3-@xmath4 conditions of our simulations are shown in fig .",
    "[ pt ] and the resulting equation of state ( eos ) for the liquid and the post - perovskite solid phases are given in tables  [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] .",
    "initially we focused our work on 7500 k and 12500 k in order to maximize the likelihood of directly observing a phase transition in the liquid during the md simulations .",
    "however , all the thermodynamic functions , that we analyzed , varied in a perfectly smooth way as function of temperature and pressure .",
    "figure  [ ve ] shows the volume and the internal energy as function of pressure .",
    "the zero of energy was set equal to the energy of a collection of isolated atoms .",
    "we conclude from this analysis , if there exists a phase transition in the liquid phase then _ ab initio _ simulations of 60 atoms are unlikely to spontaneously transform into a different phase .    .",
    "both functions are smooth and exhibit no indication of a phase transition.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    we computed the shock hugoniot curve from the usual relation  @xcite , @xmath7 where the initial volume , @xmath8=51.77 @xmath9 , and initial internal energy , @xmath10 = @xmath135.914 ev per mgsio@xmath0 formula unit ( fu ) , were taken from a dft calculation of enstatite at 3.22 g@xmath5@xmath6 that we performed .",
    "we used the same @xmath10 to derive the hugoniot curves for a glass sample with an initial density of 2.74 g@xmath5@xmath6 .",
    "@xmath11 was assumed to be zero because @xmath12 is satisfied for all final states .",
    "the resulting dft - md hugoniot curves for liquid and crystalline mgsio@xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "our results for the solid phase agree well with the earlier shock measurements using a gas gun  @xcite . however , the agreement with the decaying laser shock results is not satisfactory .",
    "a portion of our computed hugoniot curve for the solid at @xmath13 g@xmath5@xmath6 overlaps with the measurements in the temperature range from 7000 to 9000 k. also at 450 gpa and 12500 k , the calculated hugoniot curve for the liquid agrees with the measurements but the slope of the theoretical hugoniot curve is different and it shows no sign of a phase transition .",
    "the agreement for an initial density of 2.74 g@xmath5@xmath6 is again not favorable .",
    "the theoretical hugoniot the liquid passes right through the @xmath4-@xmath3 conditions where a phase transformation is predicted based on the experimental data but dft - md simulations do not exhibit one .",
    "next we investigated the possibility of the existence of a superionic phase between the solid and the liquid phases where some ions remain stationary while others diffuse throughout the material like in a liquid  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ d ] , we plot the diffusion coefficients as a function of pressure . at 12500 k ,",
    "all ions diffuse at the same rate approximately . at 7500 k ,",
    "the diffusion is slower as one would expect in the fluid near the melting line .",
    "the oxygen ions diffuse a bit faster than the magnesium and silicon ions but there is no evidence for a superionic state .",
    "we also performed heat - until - it - melts simulations of solid samples ( fig .",
    "[ pt ] ) that we isochorically heated at a rate of 1000 k per picosecond .",
    "this approach was used to predict the superionic state of water  @xcite but our sample always went into a fully fluid state after a substantial amount of superheating .",
    "figure  [ heating ] shows that the liquid always exhibits a higher pressure than the solid when compared for the same density and temperature .",
    "this means , for given temperature and pressure , the solid is always denser than the liquid .",
    "therefore the melting line of ppv mgsio@xmath0 is expected to have a positive clapeyron slope  @xcite .",
    "we performed our simulations with only 60 atoms and all results may need to be confirmed with larger simulations that possibly also use more k - points .",
    "our longest simulations ran for 20 ps , which is fairly long for _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "if a new liquid phase emerges , one would expect to observe a spontaneous phase transformation , as long as it does not involve any large - scale rearrangements of atoms . if liquid mgsio@xmath0 phase - separates into a mgo - dominated and a sio@xmath14-rich fluid , as was predicted for the solid at approximately 1000 gpa  @xcite , we would most likely not be able to observe this process in our simulations .",
    "one would instead need to perform more expensive gibbs free energy calculations  @xcite but such a complex effort goes beyond this investigation .",
    "furthermore , if there existed a new , unknown phase in the mgsio@xmath0 phase diagram , it does not have to be a liquid .",
    "one could imagine a new stable solid phase that introduces a solid - solid - liquid triple point and may lead to an increase in the slope of the melting line .",
    "at zero temperature , existence of a post - post - perovskite phase has been intensely studied with _",
    "ab initio _ random structure search algorithms and no such phase has been found but a new , entropy - stabilized phase may still exist at high temperature . in principle",
    ", this solid - solid - liquid triple point could also be between perovskite ( pv ) , ppv , and liquid phases .",
    "this point has not yet been determined neither with experimental nor with theoretical means but pv - to - ppv transition pressure is known to increases with temperature .    one may also ask whether there exists an alternative interpretation for the experimental observations .",
    "our first recommendation would be to repeat those measurements with steady shock wave experiments in order to verify the discontinuities on the principal hugoniot curve of mgsio@xmath0 .",
    "this may require a series of shock experiments with relatively small error bars but it would be an important confirmation .",
    "it is also possible that observed shock velocity reversal is related to the melting transition of mgsio@xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ pt ] shows that most of the experimental results fall in between the computed hugoniot curves for the solid and the liquid .",
    "however , the temperatures are too high for a solid phase to be thermodynamically stable .",
    "phase transition temperatures of 10@xmath5000@xmath5 and 16@xmath5000@xmath5k have been predicted based on the measurements of single - crystal and glass material  @xcite , respectively .",
    "nevertheless it is interesting to discuss the behavior of decaying shock experiments in the presence of a melting transition .",
    "some material behind the shock front may freeze during the shock decay .",
    "this could introduce a secondary wave and thereby affect the behavior of the shock front .",
    ".,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    at the beginning of a decaying shock experiments , the sample material is compressed to a state of high pressure and high temperature on the principal hugoniot curve .",
    "as the shock decays , new material does not reach as high pressures and temperatures but stays on the hugoniot curve , which allows one to map out the whole hugoniot curve with just one shock measurement .",
    "the question is what happens to the material that had compressed to a higher @xmath3-@xmath4 state earlier .",
    "one may assume that the whole region behind the shock front will equilibrate to a new pressure , which we labeled @xmath15 in fig  [ diagram ] .",
    "any parcel of material that was shocked to a high @xmath3-@xmath4 state will adiabatically expand  @xcite to reach @xmath15 and slow down to travel at the new and reduced particle velocity .",
    "since this expansion is gradual and not associated with any shock , one typically also assumes that this expansion is isentropic  @xcite ( arrows in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] ) .",
    "while one assumes a new pressure , @xmath15 , is established , the entire sample behind the shock front is not expected to reach thermal equilibrium during the experiment .",
    "this leads to the situation where hot material at a lower density is pushing on colder material at a higher density .",
    "this could lead to a fluid dynamic instability of rayleigh - taylor type if the density contrast becomes too high and the time scale is long enough for such an instability to develop .",
    "it is important to note that hugoniot curves are steeper in @xmath3-@xmath4 space than isentropes , @xmath16 .",
    "the shock front on the hugoniot curve would always enter any new thermodynamic phase , that may exist at lower temperature , before the hotter material behind the shock front reaches it .",
    "-@xmath17 diagram of the solid and liquid segments of the shock hugoniot curves for two initial densities .",
    "the labels indicate the calculated shock temperatures.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    .,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    however , the melting transition may have an effect on the shock propagation at much higher temperature .",
    "zeldovich and raizer  @xcite showed that a shock will split into two waves if the shock hugoniot curves intersects with the rayleigh line that linearly connects the initial and final states in a @xmath3-@xmath17 diagram .",
    "if the melting transition would introduce such a splitting , it would affect the shock propagation at much higher temperatures and pressures .",
    "we plotted our liquid and solid hugoniot curves the @xmath3-@xmath17 and @xmath18-@xmath19 diagrams in figures  [ pv ] and [ usup ] .",
    "for each of the hugoniot curves , let us assume that material melts at a temperature , @xmath20 , somewhere in the range spanned by the calculation in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see fig .  [ pt ] ) .",
    "if there occurred a sudden and complete phase change from liquid to solid during a decaying shock experiments at @xmath20 , it would lead to a abrupt drop in pressure , density , shock and particle velocities because intermediate values can not be realized by either phase while satisfying eq .",
    "( [ hug ] ) .    from fig .",
    "[ pv ] , we conclude that the hugoniot curves do not intersect with the rayleigh line but the material must assume a mixed state because the particle velocity decreases gradually in a decaying shock wave experiment . following the arguments that greeff _ et al . _",
    "@xcite applied to the @xmath21-to-@xmath22 transition in solid titanium , the properties of a solid - liquid mgsio@xmath0 mixture with the solid fraction , @xmath23 , can be derived from @xmath24 for a given pair of @xmath4 and @xmath3 on the melting line . under the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium ,",
    "@xmath23 can derived from eq .",
    "( [ hug ] ) for given pressure or particle velocity .",
    "for high shock velocities , the final state of the material is fully molten .",
    "as the shock decays , the solid fraction gradually increases until the shock is too weak to introduce any melting .",
    "we now want to address the question what happens as the parcels of solid - liquid mixtures expand adiabatically . the solid fraction , @xmath23 , must change to keep the entropy of the mixture , @xmath25 constant as the pressure decreases .",
    "@xmath4 adjusts to the melting temperature for given pressure .",
    "if the solid fraction , @xmath23 , gradually increases during the expansion , the particle velocity directly behind the shock front would decrease .",
    "this is not unusual but the opposite case is much more interesting .",
    "if the liquid fraction increases during the shock decay , @xmath26 , it would imply an increase in particle velocity .",
    "as a result the shock wave would split in two waves , which would make the analysis of the visar signals much more difficult .",
    "we can determine the thermodynamic parameters for such a shock wave splitting .",
    "during the expansion , the total entropy stays constant , @xmath27 .",
    "( [ s ] ) implies , @xmath28 since the entropy of the liquid is always greater than that of the solid , a positive right term in eq .",
    "( [ ds ] ) would imply that the shock wave splits into two separate waves as the decay shock experiment enter the regime of solid - liquid coexistence . without a detailed calculations of the entropies in both phases , it is not possible to determine whether this occurs in mgsio@xmath0 because the clapeyron slope enters into the calculation .",
    "however , the entropy is accessible with thermodynamic integration techniques and equation of state models  @xcite .",
    "so our hypothesis of shock wave splitting can be tested with experimental and theoretical techniques .",
    "summarizing we can say that whether a rayleigh - taylor instability exists , a new solid phase appears , the shock wave splits into two waves , or indeed a liquid - liquid phase transition is the reason for the observed shock velocity reversal remains to be determined with future experiments .",
    "concluding our theoretical investigation , we can report that our dft - md simulations to not support the hypothesis of a liquid - liquid phase transition in mgsio@xmath0 .",
    "we were not able to give an obvious alternative interpretation of the experimental findings but we do , however , suggest the measurements be repeated with steady shock waves .",
    "the experimental findings are very interesting nevertheless and will lead to a better understanding of magnesiosilicates at high temperature .",
