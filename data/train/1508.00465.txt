    "for the design of simple transfers in astrodynamics , hohmann transfers are widely used .",
    "they consist basically in a maneuvre in a system represented by a two  body problem ( 2bp ) and their solutions , consequently given by keplerian ellipses . starting from a circular orbit around a main body ,",
    "a transfer to a different ( inner or outer ) circular orbit can be achieved with just two different impulses of properly defined sense and magnitude ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in cases where 2bp is not a suitable approximation ,",
    "a similar approach can be considered with a different simplified version of the hamiltonian representing the system .",
    "the aim of the method lays on the idea of designing a transfer between orbits that are _ exact solutions _ of an _",
    "integrable approximation _ of the studied system , using a set of impulses .",
    "since , in general , physical problems have more than one degree of freedom , a suitable construction of a normal form approximating the hamiltonian of the system is needed .",
    "furthermore , many d.o.f .",
    "make representations in configuration space inadequate , since they do not give precise hints of the time evolution of the orbits at glance .",
    "thus , the baseline is the construction of a normalized integrable approximation of the model to study , that should provide : i )  analytical solutions for the motions , and ii )  suitable surfaces of sections , tools to be used for the analysis of the effects of the impulses that conform the trasfer .",
    "+ in the last decades , several semi - analytical results have been obtained in order to ensure the stability of the motions of some trojan asteroids , orbiting around the lagrangian equilibrium points @xmath2 of the sun ",
    "jupiter system .",
    "all those works share a same common structure , summarized as follows : each approach is based on an explicit algorithm , that can be translated on a computer so as to calculate the expansion of a suitable normal form , providing a good local approximation of the complete hamiltonian of the cprtbp .",
    "such a normal form is used to approximate the orbits of some objects and to prove their stability , provided they are close enough to the equilateral lagrangian points . as far as we know",
    ", the wider coverage of the tadpole orbits around @xmath2 is given in  @xcite , that is based on the kolmogorov normal form .",
    "here , we try to improve those results , by revisiting the approach developed in  @xcite . from that article",
    "we borrow two main ideas : first , we perform the initial expansions of the cprtbp hamiltonian in a suitable set of poincar  delaunay  like coordinates ( while polar coordinates were used in  @xcite ) . that particular type of canonical variables allows us to clearly distinguish a pair of slowly varying coordinates from those quickly changing their values",
    "therefore , we average the hamiltonian with respect to the angle related to the fast dynamics . this second main idea is implemented here , by using the modern lie series formalism so as to construct an _ integrable _ normal form ; this allows us to approximate also the tadpole orbits going rather far from @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , as a major novelty with respect to  @xcite ( that is based on purely analytical techniques ) , we have translated our procedure in some codes , producing suitably truncated expansions of the normal form and , therefore , explicit numerical results .    having the tools described before , we create an algorithm which is able to test the effectiveness of different impulses , after choosing an arbitrary starting point .",
    "this approach can be applied in many different systems . in particular , we focus our work in the area surrounding the lagrangian equilibrium points @xmath2 of the earth - moon system .",
    "this kind of stability region is interesting since it is located close to the earth , and could provide a natural trapping zone for small bodies as astronomical observatories , obsolet spacecrafts or space debris in general . at the end of the paper , we characterize the effects of different instantaneous impulses and we choose the best candidates for effective transfers in the framework provided by the normal form approximating the cprtbp hamiltonian .",
    "let us introduce the standard framework of the cprtbp , as done , e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "in such a model , the motion of the two biggest bodies ( hereafter , the primaries ) is not influenced by the third one , considered massless , so the orbits of the primaries are keplerian ellipses and the third body moves under the gravitational attraction exerted by the other two .",
    "additionally , we assume that both those keplerian orbits are circular and the massless body is coplanar with the primaries .",
    "let us define the heliocentric vectors @xmath4 with @xmath5 , being @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 the position vectors of the biggest primary , the smallest one and the third body , respectively , in an _ inertial _ frame . as usual , we also define the units of measures in order to set the rotation period @xmath9 and the gravitational constant @xmath10 , and we denote with @xmath11 and @xmath12 the masses of the smallest primary and the largest one , respectively .",
    "these settings imply that the semi - major axis of the ellipse described by the orbit of @xmath13 is equal to @xmath14 , while @xmath15 .    for our purposes , it is convenient to adopt the hamiltonian formalism in the non - inertial _ synodic _ frame that co - rotates with the primaries .",
    "we define the axes so that the largest primary is always located at the origin of the synodic frame , while the fixed position of the smallest primary is such that @xmath16 .",
    "let us first introduce the action  angle canonical coordinates @xmath17 , which can be seen as modified delaunay variables for the _ planar keplerian problem_. they are given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the semi - major axis , the eccentricity , the mean anomaly and the longitude of the perihelion of the massless body , being the angle @xmath22 measured in the _ inertial _ frame .",
    "moreover , @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the mean anomaly and the perihelion longitude of the smallest primary , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath25 corresponds to the _ synodic mean longitude_. the hamiltonian ruling the motion of the third body in the non - inertial synodical frame can now be written as follows : @xmath26 where the so  called disturbing function @xmath27 is such that @xmath28    in order to remove the singularity of the delaunay  like variables when @xmath29 ( i.e. , for circular orbits ) , it is convenient to introduce canonical coordinates @xmath30 , similar to the poincar coordinates for the _ planar keplerian problem_. thus , let us define @xmath31 where the values of @xmath32 are significantly small in a region surrounding the lagrangian points , for instance , in the case of tadpole or horseshoe orbits .",
    "in fact , in those cases , it holds true since @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "let us recall that those variables have been adopted in  @xcite to study the cprtbp .    before constructing a normal form , the starting hamiltonian   ( in particular , the disturbing function  )",
    "must be expanded in poincar ",
    "like coordinates @xmath30 .",
    "such a non trivial operation is described in  @xcite , which also includes all the detailed mathematica codes explicitly producing those expansions .",
    "this approach ensures that the starting hamiltonian @xmath35 can be written in the following form as a function of the poincar ",
    "like coordinates :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xmath39 , being @xmath40 a fixed positive integer .",
    "@xmath41 is the set of functions such that    * a function @xmath42 if the generic terms appearing in its taylor  fourier expansion , which are of type @xmath43 or @xmath44 , satisfy the following relations about their coefficients : latexmath:[\\[c_{m_1,m_2,m_3,k}=d_{m_1,m_2,m_3,k}=0 \\qquad{\\rm when}\\qquad 2m_1+m_2+m_3\\neq l \\quad{\\rm or}\\quad     in principle , the expansion   can be seen as a reorganization of the taylor ",
    "fourier series giving the disturbing function ; this is made in a suitable way that allows us to successfully perform the construction of the normal form .",
    "furthermore , the criterion for the choice of @xmath40 is such that the size ( in any common functional norm ) of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 is approximately the same for any value of the index @xmath49 . in other words ,",
    "the disturbing function is splitted in terms @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath48 by using the fourier decay of the coefficients for increasing values of the harmonic @xmath52 ; let us recall that in the present work @xmath11 is regarded as a fixed small parameter of the system .",
    "let us emphasize that the expansion   contains also a non - trivial information about the keplerian part ( that corresponds to the whole hamiltonian if @xmath53 ) .",
    "in fact , since @xmath54 and @xmath55 , then one can deduce that @xmath56 when the index @xmath49 is odd .",
    "this is in agreement with the expansion of the starting hamiltonian @xmath35 , when the disturbing function is neglected and the actions @xmath57 and @xmath58 are substituted according to formula  . if we explicitely write the first main terms of the keplerian part @xmath59 ^ 2= -\\frac{3}{2}+\\gamma-\\frac{3}{2}(\\rho+\\gamma)^2\\ , \\label{eq : quadr - part - kepl - appr}\\ ] ] we conclude that the angular velocities have different order of magnitude @xmath60 because @xmath61 and the values of the actions @xmath32 and @xmath58 are small in a region surrounding the lagrangian points .",
    "thus , @xmath25 can be seen as a slow angle and @xmath62 as a fast angle .",
    "then , this motivates to average the hamiltonian over the fast angle ( see , e.g. ,   52 of  @xcite ) , in order to focus mainly on the secular evolution of the system .",
    "we remove all the terms depending on the fast angle @xmath62 , by performing a sequence of canonical transformations . in the following",
    ", this strategy will be translated in an explicit algorithm .",
    "such a procedure will allow us to produce a final hamiltonian satisfying two important properties : at the same time it provides a good approximation of the starting system , it only depens on the actions and one of the angles , i.e. , it is integrable .",
    "as discussed above , the normalization algorithm defines a sequence of hamiltonians .",
    "this is done by an iterative procedure ; let us describe the basic step which introduces @xmath63 starting from @xmath64 when both the values of the indexes @xmath65 and @xmath66 are positive .",
    "we assume that the expansions of @xmath64 is such that @xmath67 where @xmath68 @xmath69 , @xmath70 @xmath71 , @xmath72 @xmath73 , @xmath74 @xmath75 .",
    "let us recall that the hamiltonian   is suitable to start the procedure with @xmath76 , after having set @xmath77 . in formula  , one can distinguish the normal form terms from the perturbing part ; the latter depends on @xmath78 in a _ generic _ way , while in the first two terms of   the fast variables can be replaced by the action @xmath79 .",
    "the @xmath80th step of the algorithm formally defines the new hamiltonian as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the lie series operator , with @xmath83 ( being @xmath84 the classical poisson bracket ) , @xmath22 a generic function defined on the phase space and @xmath85 any generating function ( for an introduction to canonical transformations by lie series in the context of the hamiltonian perturbation theory , see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the new generating function @xmath86 is determined so as to remove from the main perturbing term is expected to decrease when the indexes @xmath87 or @xmath66 are increased , because the values of @xmath11 , @xmath32 and @xmath88 are assumed to be small ] @xmath89 its subpart that is not in normal form .",
    "this is done by solving the following homological equation with respect to @xmath90 : @xmath91 where we require that @xmath92 is the new term in normal form , i.e. @xmath93 .    when @xmath94 and @xmath95 , then there exists a generating function @xmath96 and a normal form term @xmath97 solving the homological equation  .",
    "[ lem : sol_homol_eq ]    we limit ourselves to just sketch the procedure that can be followed so as to explicitly determine a solution of   and , therefore , prove the statement above .",
    "first , we replace the fast coordinates @xmath78 with the pair of complex conjugate canonical variables @xmath98 such that @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "moreover , the homological equation   has to be expanded in taylor series with respect to @xmath98 , using the slow coordinates @xmath101 as fixed parameters ( because they are not affected by the poisson bracket @xmath102 , since @xmath103 do not depend on them ) .",
    "therefore , we solve term - by - term the equation   in the unknown coefficients @xmath104 and @xmath105 such that @xmath106 \\ , \\qquad z_{r_2}^{(r_1)}(\\rho , z,\\lambda,\\imunit{\\overline z})= \\sum_{m}\\big[\\zeta_{m}(\\rho,\\lambda)z^{m}(\\imunit{\\overline z})^{m}\\big]\\ .\\ ] ] at last , we express the expansions above by replacing @xmath98 for @xmath78 , so as to obtain the final solutions in the form @xmath90 and @xmath93 .",
    "the following property of the poisson brackets is very useful for our purposes , and since the proof is immediate , it is omitted .",
    "let @xmath107 and @xmath22 be two generic functions such that @xmath108 and @xmath109 , then @xmath110 [ lem : alg - prop - pois - brackets ]    in order to provide an algorithm easy to translate in a programming language , we are going to give explicit formulas for the new hamiltonian @xmath63 and for its expansion that can be written as follows : @xmath111 for the sake of simplicity in the calculation of @xmath112 , we redefine the same quantity several times using the same symbol .",
    "this notation of the algorithm is more similar to its translation in a programming code , and , thus , more useful : let us introduce the recursive operation @xmath113 , where the previously defined quantity @xmath114 is redefined as @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , we initially define @xmath116 then , we consider the contribution of the terms generated by the lie series applied to each function belonging to the normal form part as follows : @xmath117 where the upper limits @xmath118 and @xmath119 on the indexes @xmath120 and @xmath49 , respectively , are such that @xmath121 for what concerns the contributions given by the perturbing terms making part of the expansion of @xmath64 in  , we have @xmath122 where the limiting values for the indexes , that are @xmath118 and @xmath123 , are defined in  .    the redefinition rules   and   are set so that the new perturbing part generated by the lie series in   is coherently split in different terms according to their order of magnitude in @xmath11 and their total polynomial degree in the actions .",
    "in fact , by applying repeatedly proposition  [ lem : alg - prop - pois - brackets ] to the redefinitions in   , it is possible to inductively verify that @xmath124 @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , the terms making part of the hamiltonian  @xmath63 in the expansion   share the same properties with those appearing in  ; this ensures that the normalization algorithm can be iterated so as to construct @xmath126      from an ideal point of view , we would be interested in producing the final hamiltonian @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is defined as @xmath129 @xmath130 .",
    "in fact , such a hamiltonian would be integrable , because it would depend from the fast variables just through the action @xmath131 , due to the special form of the expansion  . in general , the problem , depends just on the fast action @xmath131 .",
    "] of the restrictions of domains prevents the convergence of the limits ( with respect to both indexes @xmath65 and @xmath132 , when the standard @xmath133norm is used ) ; thus , it is not possible to define the integrable hamiltonian on any open set ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "actually , from a mathematical point of view , expansions of type   are _ asympotic series _ with respect to both @xmath65 and @xmath132 ; this means that we have to truncate the indexes , but in a way that optimize our result . for this purpose",
    ", we can proceed as follows .",
    "first , we introduce the functions @xmath134 and @xmath135 that make explicit the splitting between the integrable and the perturbing parts in the expansion  , so that @xmath136 therefore , we look for the pair of upper indexes @xmath137 minimizing the @xmath133norm of @xmath138 ( on the set of values of the variables that we are interested to study ) .",
    "this approach can be implemented with a suitable scheme of analytic estimates , in order to reduce exponentially the remainder @xmath139 with respect to the small parameters of the problem ( see  @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "such an optimal choice about the final values of the indexes @xmath65 and @xmath66 allows us to reformulate the algorithm , in such a way that it requires just @xmath140 normalization steps , constructing the finite sequence of hamiltonians @xmath141 , where @xmath142 @xmath143 .    while the algorithm has been rearranged so as to be performed in a finite number of normalization steps , it is evident that the redefinition rules reported in formulas   and   would require to calculate infinitely many poisson brackets . in order to avoid such a problem",
    ", we have to establish two truncation rules on the terms appearing in the expansions , so as to fix ( a )  their maximal exponent @xmath144 related to the order of magnitude @xmath145 ,  ( b ) their total maximal degree @xmath146 on the index @xmath49 ( that is equal to twice the degree in @xmath32 plus the one in @xmath147 and that in @xmath148 ) . if our formal algorithm is subject to a further restriction , such that it is limited to the calculation of functions belonging to classes of type @xmath41 with @xmath149 and @xmath150 , then it can be proved that it requires a _ finite _ total number of poisson brackets .",
    "therefore , this newly restricted version of our algorithm is suitable to be translated in a programming code . in principle , the values of @xmath146 and @xmath144 should be chosen in order to optimize the final results ; in practice , they are usually fixed ( as well as the final indexes @xmath151 and @xmath152 ) so as to fit with the available computational resources .",
    "it is well known that lie series induce canonical transformations in a hamiltonian framework ; this fundamental feature will allow us to design a numerical integration method , by using both the normal form discussed above and the corresponding canonical coordinates . in order to explicitly realize such a project",
    ", we have to introduce some more complicate notations .",
    "let us denote with @xmath153 the set of canonical coordinates related to the @xmath80th step .",
    "by appying the so called exchange theorem ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , we have that @xmath154 where the variables related to the previous step , namely @xmath155 , are given as @xmath156 the r.h.s .",
    "of the equation above means that four lie series must be applied separatedly to each variable , in order to properly define all the coordinates for the canonical transformation @xmath157 .",
    "the whole normalization procedure can be described by the canonical transformation @xmath158 such a composition of all the intermediate changes of variables can be used for providing the following semi - analytical scheme to integrate the equations of motion : @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the flow induced on the canonical coordinates by the generic hamiltonian @xmath161 for an interval of time equal to @xmath162 .",
    "let us emphasize that the above integration scheme provides an approximate solution ; from an ideal point of view ( i.e. , if all the expansions were performed without errors and truncations ) , formula   would be exact if @xmath163 would correspond to the complete hamiltonian @xmath164 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath163 is _ integrable _ and its flow is easy to compute , it is convenient to introduce the temporary action  angle variables @xmath165 such that @xmath166 and @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is a constant of motion for the normal form @xmath169 . by considering @xmath168 as a fixed parameter and using the standard quadrature method for conservative systems with @xmath14  d.o.f .",

    "the same can be done for the evolution of @xmath173 , by evaluating the integral corresponding to the differential equation @xmath174 . for practical purposes ,",
    "the application of the classical quadrature method can be replaced by any numerical integrator that is precise enough .",
    "finally , the values of @xmath175 and @xmath176 can be directly calculated from those of the corresponding action ",
    "angle variables , that are @xmath177 and @xmath173 .",
    "] , reasons why using @xmath163 becomes valuable .",
    "the approximate solution provided by the scheme   is as more accurate as smaller the perturbing part @xmath139 is with respect to @xmath163 ( see their definitions in  ) .    as a final remark",
    ", we stress that it requires a _",
    "finite _ total number of operations , if we limit the the expansions of the canonical transformations as discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "thus , also the whole integration scheme   can be translated in a programming code .      in order to test the accuracy of our integrable normal form approximating the hamiltonian",
    ", we have to choose a suitable surface of section for the comparison with the complete problem .",
    "the most logical choice about the sectioning of the flow is given by the surface defined by @xmath178 , because @xmath62 is a fast angle ( recall the discussion about formula  ) .    in fig .",

    "in this work we explicitly construct an integrable normal form approximating the cprtbp hamiltonian .",
    "this is done by reformulating the approach described in  @xcite so as to use some more modern techniques , developed in the framework of the hamiltonian perturbation theory and mainly based on the lie series formalism .",
    "this allow us to design an algorithm that can be fully translated in programming codes .",
    "in particular , we produce a truncation of the normal form @xmath209 , whose the expansion in   highlights that it is an average of the cprtbp hamiltonian with respect to the angle associated to its fast dynamics .",
    "the first results provided by this revisited approach are encouraging : in some suitable surface of sections our algorithm provides very good approximations of the tadpole orbits close enough to @xmath3 .",
    "however , we are aware of the fact that the accuracy of our expansions must be strongly improved in order to face challenging concrete problems in a region far from those equilibrium points . in our opinion ,",
    "the main constraint on the quality of our results is due to the truncations on the fourier series in the slow angle @xmath25 .",
    "we think that this limitation can be removed , by representing the dependence on @xmath25 in a suitable way , so as to avoid fourier expansions .",
    "we plan to investigate such a new approach in the near future .",
    "furthermore , we show a first astrodynamical application starting from our calculation of the integrable normal form @xmath209 , which approximates the cprtbp hamiltonian .",
    "we design an algorithm that allowed to compute optimal transfers between orbits in the neighborhood of the equilateral lagrangian equilibrium points .",
    "we generate impulses in cartesian variables according to formula  , on a grid of values for @xmath196 , the magnitude of the impulse , and @xmath197 , the direction .",
    "for those , we are able to discriminate the _ suitable transfers _ , that imply a final orbit closer to the equilibrium point , according to a new criterion . using our normal form as an approximation of the complete cprtbp",
    ", we estimate the area enclosed by the final orbit , and minimizing this quantity , we select the best candidates for the transfer .",
    "a careful inspection of the plots shows that the best candidates are highly depending on the size of the impulse , and very sensitive to the changes on the angle @xmath197 .",
