    "observational astronomy is currently experiencing a golden age of digital data . the advent of sensitive electronic cameras that can be mounted on large aperture telescopes has enabled a new generation of wide - field ground - based galaxy surveys at optical and near infrared wavelengths .",
    "these surveys aim to obtain photometric data for millions of galaxies over thousands of square degrees of sky .",
    "wide - field optical survey astronomy was revolutionised by data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "data release 9 of sdss @xcite contains more than 930 million catalogued objects over 14,555 sq - deg of the northern hemisphere corresponding to a source density of @xmath264,000/deg@xmath8 .",
    "the 5000 sq - deg dark energy survey ( des ) represents the next leap forward in the southern hemisphere with an expected source density of @xmath9100,000/deg@xmath8 .",
    "des is a wide - field optical survey optimised for studies of weak gravitational lensing , large - scale structure and galaxy clusters , in particular from the millimeter wavelength south pole telescope ( spt ) sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) cluster survey . in addition",
    ", des also includes a deeper multi - epoch supernova survey over 30 sq - deg .",
    "the optical des data are complemented by near infrared ( nir ) data from the vista hemisphere survey ( vhs ; @xcite ) .",
    "together these two surveys will eventually provide a unique 7-band photometric dataset over @xmath24500 sq - deg of the southern sky .",
    "figure [ fig : area ] shows the coverage of all vhs data processed until april 2014 in the des region , together with the des science verification observations .",
    "des differs from previous optical surveys like sdss due to the red - sensitive ccds used by the decam camera and its high throughput out to wavelengths of almost 1@xmath10 m in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 filters .",
    "near infrared photometry in the @xmath13 and @xmath14-bands out to @xmath22@xmath10 m would therefore form a natural extension to the des wavelength coverage .",
    "the addition of nir photometry to optical data provides several advantages .",
    "firstly , at @xmath15 , the 4000 break in early type galaxies which is commonly used as a photometric redshift discriminator , moves from the optical to the nir bands .",
    "the addition of nir data may therefore lead to significantly more accurate photometric redshifts for galaxies at @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "these galaxies will serve as important probes of the evolution of large - scale structure with redshift .",
    "nir data is also extremely sensitive to the reddest galaxies which often reside in galaxy clusters , as well as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) at all redshifts and can therefore help with their identification .",
    "many of these sources will be targeted with the next generation of wide - field spectroscopic surveys such as desi @xcite and 4most @xcite and it is important to assess the quality of the photometric data to judge its suitability for target selection ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the des+vhs photometric data will also contribute significantly to the landscape of multi - wavelength surveys in the southern sky over the next decade , providing interesting targets for both the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) and the extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) and enabling the identification of optical counterparts for the square kilometer array ( ska ) pathfinders and eventually leading up to the full ska .",
    "finally , it should be stressed that the techniques for combining the data outlined here as well as the science applications that are described are just as relevant to combining optical and near infrared data from many other ongoing wide - field galaxy surveys - e.g. vst - atlas , vst - kids , panstarrs , hsc , skymapper , vista viking .    in this paper",
    "we describe joint optical+ nir photometric catalogues from des + vhs , produced over a single decam field covering 3 sq - deg of the des science verification data .",
    "we use the deeper des detection images to extract fluxes and associated errors from the shallower nir data .",
    "section [ sec : data ] describes the surveys used in this work and section [ sec : method ] describes the dual photometry method .",
    "the astrometry , photometry and star - galaxy separation of the combined catalogues are checked in section [ sec : astrom ] , [ sec : photo ] and [ sec : sg ] respectively .",
    "while this sort of dual photometry method has been used extensively in astronomical surveys for the construction of multi - wavelength photometric catalogues , it is usually applied to datasets that are comparable in terms of their depth and sensitivity . by contrast , the vhs data is significantly shallower than des , which means that the majority of des detections lie below the 5@xmath17 level of the vhs images .",
    "a key aim of this paper is to assess whether enough useful information can be extracted even from low signal - to - noise flux measurements , to enhance the science that will be possible with des data alone . with this in mind",
    ", we also present some illustrative science applications of our combined data including photometric redshift estimates ( section [ sec : photoz ] ) and target selection of both luminous red galaxies and quasars ( section [ sec : target ] ) .",
    "all magnitudes are on the ab system .",
    "this is the native photometric system for des and the vhs magnitudes have been converted from vega to ab using the following corrections : @xmath18=j@xmath19 + 0.937 , @xmath20=k@xmath19 + 1.839 .",
    "the dark energy survey @xcite is an optical survey that is imaging 5000 sq - deg of the southern celestial hemisphere in the @xmath21 bands using a dedicated camera , decam @xcite on the blanco 4-m telescope in ctio .",
    "the survey aims to understand the nature and evolution of dark energy using a multi - probe approach , utilising measurements of large - scale structure , weak gravitational lensing , galaxy cluster counts and a dedicated multi - epoch supernova survey over 30 sq - deg .",
    "the wide survey will go down to a nominal @xmath22-band magnitude limit of 25.3 ( 5@xmath17 ; psf ) or 24.0@xmath230.10 ( 10@xmath17 ; galaxy ) .",
    "the camera obtained its first light images in september 2012 and this was followed by a period of commissioning and science verification observations ( sv hereafter ) lasting between october 2012 and february 2013 .",
    "several high priority fields were targetted as part of this sv phase including well - known spectroscopic training set fields overlapping spectroscopic surveys like vvds , aces and zcosmos , several well - known galaxy clusters as well as @xmath2250 sq - deg of area covered by the spt survey .",
    "decam imaging overlapping data from deep spectroscopic redshift surveys were obtained for the following four fields : sn - x3 , sn - c3 , vvds f14 , and cosmos @xcite .",
    "each of the four fields covers about the area of single decam pointing , or about 3 sq - deg and more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "all fields include imaging in the 6 filters @xmath24 .",
    "the data have been processed to two imaging depths : `` main '' , corresponding to approximately des main survey exposure times , and `` deep '' , corresponding to about 3 times the exposure of a single visit to a des supernova deep field ( for sn - x3 and sn - c3 ) or deeper ( for cosmos ) .",
    "details of the data reduction and the exposure times used are given in @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we work with the decam imaging in the sn - x3 field only , processed to the  main \" survey depth .",
    "we only use the des @xmath21 photometry as @xmath25-band data will not be available for the main wide - field survey .",
    "the sn - x3 field has been chosen from among the four spectroscopic training set fields as it is the only one with complete overlap with vhs near infrared imaging . the sn - c3 field is partially covered by the vista viking survey , which complements vhs and the vvds f14 and cosmos fields lie outside the vhs survey region .",
    "the data were processed using the same codes used by des data management ( desdm ) to process des imaging data @xcite , in particular for image detrending , astrometric calibration ( scamp ; @xcite ) , image remapping and coaddition ( swarp v2.34.0 ; @xcite ) and object detection and photometry ( sextractor v2.18.7 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the typical photometric calibration uncertainty is @xmath65% .",
    "the @xmath26-band image was used as the detection image in construction of these early photometric catalogues although we note that @xmath27 images are now used by desdm for object detection in order to provide increased sensitivity to red objects . for the purposes of our analysis",
    "however , the @xmath26-band data is significantly deeper than the nir vhs data so using the @xmath26-band for detection does not affect the statistical properties of the joint optical+nir source population although we note that these catalogues are likely to be incomplete to very rare , extremely red objects .",
    "the data were generally processed by running these codes in `` standalone '' mode at fermilab , rather than by running them within the desdm processing framework at ncsa . running `` standalone ''",
    "was needed as the desdm framework was not yet fully setup at the time ( spring 2013 ) to process and calibrate the data for these isolated fields all the way through to image coaddition .    though we basically used the desdm codes",
    ", there were some detailed differences in processing and photometric calibration that are highlighted in @xcite .",
    "for the purposes of this paper however , the decam imaging over sn - x3 is representative of the optical photometry that will be available from the final des survey .",
    "the vista hemisphere survey ( vhs ) is a nir photometric survey being conducted using the vista telescope in chile , that aims to cover 18,000 sq - deg of the southern celestial hemisphere to a depth 30 times fainter than the 2mass survey in at least two wavebands ( @xmath13 and @xmath28 ) . in the south galactic cap ,",
    "@xmath24500 sq - deg of sky overlapping des is being imaged deeper in order to better supplement the optical data available from des .",
    "this area is known as vhs - des hereafter and goes down to median depths of @xmath29 and @xmath30 for 5@xmath17 detection of a point source .",
    "the remainder of the high galactic latitude sky is being imaged in the @xmath31 bands and combined with optical photometry from the vst - atlas survey .",
    "this vhs - atlas area has 5@xmath17 nominal magnitude limits of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "some portions of vhs - des and vhs - atlas also include data in the @xmath34-band .",
    "the low galactic latitude sky is known as vhs - gps and also goes down to @xmath35 . in this paper",
    ", we work with the vhs - des images and catalogues overlapping the 3 sq - deg decam pointing centred on the sn - x3 field .",
    "we now introduce several definitions pertinent to the vhs data that will be relevant later .",
    "the vircam camera used for vhs imaging constitutes a sparse array of 16 individual detectors that cover a region of 0.595 sq - deg . in order to get contiguous coverage of the 1.5 sq - deg field - of - view ( 1.02 deg in ra and 1.48 deg in dec ) ,",
    "six exposures are therefore required .",
    "these six exposures are termed pawprints and together they produce a single coadd tile . due to the smaller size of the vircam field of view relative to decam ,",
    "each decam pointing overlaps multiple vircam tiles which are combined as detailed later .",
    "vhs imaging data has been processed using the vista data flow system ( vdfs ; @xcite ) operated by the cambridge astronomical survey unit ( casu ) .",
    "data processing steps follow standard procedures for infrared photometry instrumental signature removal including bias , non - linearity , dark , flat and fringing corrections . sky background tracking and removal are done using all observations executed during a night .",
    "the pawprint images are then combined into a coadd tile .",
    "photometric calibration is done using 2mass on a tile by tile basis and makes use of the 2mass @xmath36 stellar photometry to calibrate the vhs data as detailed in @xcite .",
    "specifically , the following colour equations are derived between the 2mass and vista @xmath13 and @xmath28 filters :    @xmath37    @xmath38    the photometric calibration in the @xmath13 and @xmath28-bands has a typical uncertainty of @xmath61.5% ( hodgkin et al . in preparation ) .",
    "finally , catalogues are generated using the astrometry , photometry , shape and data quality control information .",
    "all images and catalogues used in this work are supplied with the appropriate astrometric and photometric calibrations from vdfs .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up of the des supernova fields ( including the sn - x3 field ) , is currently being conducted as part of the ozdes survey on the anglo - australian telescope ( yuan et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the fibre fed spectrograph on the aat allows ozdes to pursue several parallel scientific goals .",
    "a strong focus is on spectroscopic follow - up of supernova host galaxies and repeat observations of active galactic nuclei for reverberation mapping .",
    "other targets include galaxy clusters , luminous red galaxies , emission line galaxies , as well as a flux - limited sample of photometric redshift calibration targets .",
    "ozdes is a 5 year survey which began in 2013 and the first season of observations is now complete .",
    "ozdes redshifts have been combined with other redshifts in these fields from spectroscopic surveys including sdss @xcite , 6df @xcite , gama @xcite , vvds @xcite , vipers @xcite and snls supernova hosts @xcite .",
    "we make use of this master spectroscopic redshift catalogue to assess the quality and utility of the des+vhs catalogues in much of the analysis that follows but note here that this does not form a homogenous population of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies .",
    "the gama and 6df surveys in particular constitute the brightest and lowest redshift galaxies in the local universe while deeper surveys like vvds and vipers extend to much higher redshifts .",
    "the ozdes spectroscopically confirmed galaxies too do not form a uniform flux - limited sample due to the fact that at a fixed magnitude , redshifts are more easily determinable for certain sub - classes of galaxies in the ozdes survey .",
    "these caveats should be kept in mind when photometric redshifts for this catalogue are presented in section [ sec : photoz ] .",
    "vhs is by design much shallower than des but nevertheless represents the deepest near infrared survey that will overlap with most of the des area on completion of des .",
    "most of the des galaxies do not have an nir counterpart in the vhs 5@xmath17 catalogues .",
    "furthermore , the vhs catalogue production pipeline is different from that used by des which means that different prescriptions for profile fitting as well as different aperture radii have been used to measure magnitudes in the two surveys .",
    "combining the des and vhs data in an optimal way requires joint photometry to be carried out on the pixel level data from both surveys .",
    "the joint photometry method can make use of the deeper des detections to extract fluxes from objects that lie below the signal - to - noise threshold used in the construction of the vhs catalogues .",
    "the concept is illustrated in figure [ fig : images ] where we present des @xmath26-band and vhs @xmath13-band images centred on a galaxy cluster in the sn - x3 field which clearly demonstrates the difference in depth between the two surveys . as is apparent from this figure",
    ", there is a significant amount of information in the vhs images below the 5@xmath17 threshold used to construct the vhs catalogues .",
    "our aim in this paper is to present the first attempt at extracting this extra information directly from the vhs images by making use of the des detections .",
    "the nir data represents extra information about the source spectral energy distribution at long wavelengths and , as we will demonstrate later , even in the presence of noise , it can serve as a useful discriminant in breaking degeneracies between galaxy properties .",
    "a consequence of performing joint photometry is also so that we ensure that magnitudes are measured consistently across both surveys thus avoiding biases in the optical - nir colours due to systematic offsets between different magnitude measures for different galaxy populations .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : metrics ]    more interesting perhaps than these overall metrics are the trends in these as a function of redshift .",
    "figure [ fig : metrics ] shows both the bias and @xmath39 as a function of photometric redshift both for des and des+vhs estimates of the photometric redshift .",
    "these plots are produced after weighting the spectroscopic sample of galaxies as discussed earlier and also after removing 10% of galaxies with the largest photometric redshift errors .",
    "the bias looks relatively similar for the two datasets although as noted earlier , this bias can be estimated with a smaller error when the vhs data are included in the photometric redshift estimates .",
    "looking at the scatter we find that , in this single field there is a significant improvement in @xmath39 in the redshift bin @xmath40 , although these results may be prone to cosmic variance . at @xmath41 and @xmath16",
    "too there is evidence for a consistent drop in the scatter on addition of vhs data to des , across multiple redshift bins , although currently the error bars are large due to small number statistics in this single decam pointing , which does not contain enough spectroscopic galaxies at the edges of the des redshift distribution . inspecting the best - fit templates for those galaxies where the nir data reduces the photometric redshift scatter , we find that quite often the nir allows us to distinguish between an early - type sed and a reddened starburst sed",
    ". the larger scatter at the low and high redshift ends is driven mainly by the poorer sampling of the 4000 break by the des optical filters in these redshift ranges . at low redshifts ,",
    "@xmath25-band photometry can help traverse the balmer break while at higher redshifts , near infrared photometry is required .",
    "the minimum in the photometric redshift scatter occurs at @xmath420.7 where the 4000 break is in the middle of the optical filters .",
    "although the weighting method has been used to try and overcome biases associated with the available spectroscopic sample , in this single field , the statistics may also be strongly influenced by a small number of highly weighted galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , these first results on the photometric redshifts from des and vhs data are encouraging and suggest that the near infrared photometry derived from the des detection images , can be used to improve the des - only photometric redshift performance . in the future , widening the analysis to the full des+vhs area will enable us to have much larger sub - samples of both red galaxies as well as @xmath43 galaxies , where the vhs data is expected to result in the most substantial improvements to the photometric redshift performance .",
    "we note that the rms scatter in the photometric redshift at @xmath4 seen in the right panel of figure [ fig : metrics ] , is entirely consistent with the expectations from simulations where the vhs data was found to reduce the scatter from @xmath20.2 to @xmath20.15 at these high redshifts @xcite .",
    "in the low signal - to - noise regime probed by the vhs forced photometry catalogues , logarithmic magnitude estimates are also clearly biased and fluxes and associated errors provide a more unbiased measure of the galaxy photometry ( see e.g. discussion in appendix a of @xcite ) . adapting existing photometric redshift codes to work with negative flux measurements and associated errors will therefore undoubtedly improve the constraints on photometric redshifts from the combined des+vhs dataset .",
    "the next generation of wide - field spectroscopic surveys e.g. 4most @xcite and desi @xcite , will target a wide variety of extragalactic sources in order to constrain both models of galaxy formation and cosmic acceleration .",
    "targets for these spectroscopic surveys will need to be selected using photometric data e.g. from des and vhs @xcite .",
    "there are primarily three types of targets for which spectroscopic redshifts will be obtained - luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) at @xmath44 , emission line galaxies ( elgs ) out to z@xmath21.5 ( depending on the red cut - off of the spectrograph ) and quasars at @xmath45 where optical spectrographs can detect the ly@xmath46 forest . while the blue elgs can be effectively selected using optical colours only , the near infrared vhs data should aid the selection of both lrgs and quasars for these next generation wide - field spectroscopic surveys .",
    "we investigate the utility of our des+vhs catalogues for both lrg and quasar selection here .    as described in section [ sec : ozdes ] , spectroscopic follow - up of des targets in the sn fields is currently being conducted as part of the ozdes survey .",
    "ozdes can therefore serve as a pilot study for designing and honing photometric target selection methods using des+vhs data , for the next generation of wide - field spectroscopic surveys .",
    "once again we therefore make use of the ozdes redshift catalogue in order to assess the effectiveness of simple optical+nir target selection criteria for isolating both high redshift lrgs and quasars .",
    "these are meant to serve as illustrative examples of the feasibility of using des+vhs data for target selection for future surveys . in the future",
    ", these selection criteria will need to be further improved to produce the target densities necessary for different science applications .",
    "we have employed a simple colour - selection in des+vhs @xmath47 space to select luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) at high redshifts of @xmath480.5 which extends the redshift range of currently available spectroscopic samples for photometric redshift calibration and large scale structure studies .",
    "the colour selection is shown in figure [ fig : lrgz ] , where we demonstrate that the use of the vhs nir photometry is particularly useful for the removal of galactic m - stars , which have very similar optical colours to the lrgs .",
    "@xmath49    we apply this selection over the sn - x3 field which results in @xmath22500 lrg candidates over 3 sq - deg . out of these",
    ", there are 811 galaxies in total with spectroscopic redshift measurements from a variety of spectroscopic surveys in this field including aaomega observations obtained as part of ozdes yr 1 where the specific lrg selection described above was applied to select targets .",
    "seven hundred and nine of the 811 have high confidence redshift measurements .",
    "the number of lrg targets with secure redshifts from ozdes only is 291 , which represents @xmath240% of the secure redshift sample .",
    "the redshift distribution for all 709 galaxies is shown in figure [ fig : lrgz ] .",
    "only 1 target has @xmath50 and is not an lrg and there are three stars that were selected as lrgs . the rest of our targets with secure redshifts , are all at 0.3@xmath51 so for the subset of targets for which secure redshift identifications are possible , the contamination fraction to the colour - selection from non - lrgs is @xmath60.5% .",
    "we note that there may be a higher proportion of non - lrgs among those targets for which secure redshifts have not been measured and a thorough analysis of the purity and completeness of the lrg selection is deferred to future ozdes specific papers .",
    "we confirm through visual inspection of the spectra of the @xmath52 targets , that these are mostly early type galaxies with a prominent balmer break .",
    "the median redshift is 0.72 and the median @xmath28-band magnitude is 18.9 .",
    "we can see that the des+vhs colour - selection is therefore effectively picking high redshift lrgs",
    ". optical colour selection of lrgs for example in the boss survey , results in a sample with a lower median redshift of @xmath20.5 @xcite , albeit using a smaller optical telescope , which is less sensitive at red wavelengths than decam .",
    "however , at @xmath5 , contamination from galactic m - stars can be an issue for optical only selection methods .",
    "indeed @xcite find that optical only colour selection methods suffer from @xmath216 - 30% contamination from these m - stars and the nir photometry helps to effectively alleviate this problem .",
    "as mentioned above , using the nir selection , @xmath60.5% of spectroscopically confirmed lrg targets are found to be galactic m - stars .",
    "similar target selection criteria can therefore be applied to the combined des+vhs data resulting from the final 5 year survey in order to select extragalactic lrg targets for wide - field spectroscopic surveys like 4most and desi .",
    "next - generation wide - field spectroscopic surveys such as desi also aim to obtain spectra for quasars at @xmath45 in order to measure the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) at high redshifts through the ly@xmath46 forest .",
    "bright quasars illuminate the intergalactic medium at these redshifts enabling detailed measurements of the clustering properties of clumps of neutral hydrogen gas along the line of sight between us and the quasar , which show up as absorption features in the quasar spectra .",
    "bright quasars therefore need to be isolated as targets for spectroscopic surveys from photometric catalogues like des+vhs .",
    "quasars can be distinguished from similarly blue star - forming galaxies through morphological classification .",
    "the brightest quasars suitable for ly@xmath46 forest measurements , appear as unresolved , nuclear point sources in imaging data and are easily separated from extended sources like galaxies .",
    "more difficult is the separation of quasars from stars which substantially outnumber the quasars in terms of their space density on the sky , particularly at bright magnitudes .",
    "the optical colours of @xmath45 quasars closely resemble those of stars and the best separation is seen in the @xmath53 colour - colour plane where the well - known uv - excess of quasars relative to stars , can be used as a discriminant between the two populations @xcite .",
    "however , in the southern hemisphere , des lacks @xmath25-band coverage .",
    "alternative selection criteria therefore need to be devised , for example using quasar variability to distinguish them from stars @xcite .",
    "it has been known for some time that in addition to the well - known uv excess in quasar spectral energy distributions , they also display an excess in the @xmath14-band relative to stars @xcite , a property that has been exploited to conduct wide - field quasar surveys using the near infrared @xcite . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the kx quasars are actually more effective than the uvx method in selecting complete samples at @xmath54 where the optical quasar colours begin to run into the stellar locus .",
    "our des+vhs catalogues may therefore be useful for photometric quasar selection given the lack of @xmath25-band data in des .",
    "@xcite used a simple colour selection in the @xmath55 colour - colour plane to photometrically select quasars from the sdss+ukidss . here",
    "we present a very similar @xmath56 selection with the added advantage that at fainter magnitudes it makes use of the higher signal - to - noise @xmath22-band data from des .",
    "we also make use of _ wise _ photometry @xcite at 3.4@xmath10 m ( w1 ) and 4.6@xmath10 m ( w2 ) to further discriminate between quasars and stars .",
    "we note that the _ wise _ data contains quasars out to the highest redshifts @xcite and can therefore effectively be used to target bright quasars at all redshifts .",
    "the selection for quasars is defined as follows :    @xmath57    applying the des+vhs colour and morphology selection to our optical+nir catalogue in the sn - x3 field , we find @xmath21800 @xmath58 candidates over the 3 sq - deg .",
    "these are then matched to _ wise _ data from the _ allwise _ release with @xmath275% yielding _ wise _ counterparts . applying the _ wise _ colour selection ,",
    "we are left with 200 candidates over the 3 sq - deg . in order to test whether the selection has been effective in isolating luminous quasars , we once again make use of the ozdes master redshift catalogue which includes quasars from vvds - deep , vipers , spectroscopic follow - up of x - ray selected agn from @xcite as well as aaomega observations of the field . out of the 200 targets ,",
    "127 currently have high confidence redshift measurements .",
    "fifty one of the 127 spectroscopic objects are quasars at @xmath59 and only 13 are stars representing a stellar contamination fraction of @xmath210% for those objects with secure redshifts .",
    "in addition , there are 5 galaxies and the remaining objects are all lower redshift quasars . although the numbers are small over this single decam pointing , we conclude that the des+vhs catalogues together with _ wise _ data are proving effective in photometrically selecting quasars .",
    "these catalogues have also been used for target selection of quasars for reverberation mapping monitoring as part of the ozdes project and the larger quasar catalogue over the wider field - of - view , will be presented in yuan et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "in this first paper describing the optical + near infrared catalogues from des and vhs , we have demonstrated that these catalogues can be effectively used to improve photometric redshifts from the des - only data as well as for target selection for wide - field spectroscopic surveys . through simple colour selection criteria that have been applied to the joint catalogues from the des science verification period",
    ", we have shown that des+vhs can be used for the selection of both broad - line quasars as well as luminous red galaxies at high redshifts of @xmath60 . in future work",
    ", these selection criteria will be honed to provide purer and more complete samples of these populations .",
    "the current work has focussed in particular on photometric redshifts and target selection with des+vhs data but we highlight that the joint photometry catalogue produced from the two surveys will also enable a range of other investigations which will significantly enhance the science possible from des alone .",
    "we have shown in section [ sec : sg ] that the vhs near infrared colours could be useful for star - galaxy separation in des .",
    "the inclusion of near infrared photometry will also result in improved stellar mass estimates for des galaxies as the older long - lived stellar populations in galaxies that contribute most to their total mass , are redder in colour ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "even for the bluest galaxies , near infrared photometry can help break degeneracies in spectral energy distribution fit parameters ( e.g. @xcite ) demonstrating the utility of the vhs data in constraining stellar masses of des galaxies .",
    "des is also capable of potentially identifying very massive ( m@xmath61m@xmath62 ) galaxies at @xmath63 , should they exist , and the near infrared data will be useful in distinguishing these galaxies from other contaminant populations @xcite .",
    "the vhs data will also be more sensitive than des to rare populations of extremely red objects such as high redshift quasars @xcite , cool dwarfs in our own milky way ( e.g. @xcite ) as well as the dustiest quasars which represent supermassive black - holes in the process of formation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "many of these will be undetected or extremely faint in des but the optical photometry is nevertheless necessary in order to verify the extreme colours of these rare sources and discriminate between them and other contaminant populations .",
    "initial investigation of the colours of high redshift quasars in the des+vhs science verification data shows that the forced photometered vhs fluxes still provide useful colour information for @xmath64 quasars .",
    "the quasar cfhqs j022743@xmath1060530 was discovered by the canada france hawaii quasar survey and lies at a redshift of @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "it is the only existing high redshift quasar to overlap the des science verification observations .",
    "the search for and discovery of new high redshift quasars in the des science verification data are presented in reed et al .",
    "( in preparation ) . from the des imaging , we find that cfhqs0227@xmath10605 is undetected in the des @xmath22-band and has a @xmath11-band psf magnitude of 22.16 .",
    "we measure colours in a 1 arc sec aperture of @xmath66=3.66 and @xmath67=0.42 where the latter comes from the forced photometry des+vhs catalogue .",
    "we note here that unlike the forced photometry catalogues in the sn - x3 field presented in this paper , the joint des+vhs forced photometry catalogue overlapping cfhqs j022743@xmath1060530 uses the @xmath27 combined image for object detection and is therefore sensitive to objects that are not detected in the @xmath26-band . as mentioned in section [ sec : des ] however , these @xmath26-band drop - outs are extremely rare and use of the @xmath26-band for detection does not affect the conclusions of this paper .",
    "cfhqs j022743@xmath1060530 is among the faintest @xmath64 quasars currently known and has a signal - to - noise of @xmath21 in our @xmath13-band forced photometry catalogues .",
    "the @xmath67 colour is typically used to rule out a cool star classification as cool dwarfs in our own milky way are the main contaminants in high redshift quasar searches . despite the low signal - to - noise , we find that the measured @xmath67 colour of this source is consistent with that of a high redshift quasar @xcite .",
    "a higher signal - to - noise detection in the @xmath13-band leading to a redder @xmath67 colour , would favour a cool star identification for this object . even in the low signal - to - noise regime ,",
    "limits on the near infrared photometry obtained using the des detections can therefore help set important constraints on the colours for the identification of high redshift quasars .",
    "we have described the construction of a joint optical and near infrared ( @xmath0 ) photometric catalogue from the dark energy survey and vista hemisphere survey over a single 3 sq - deg decam pointing centred at 02h26@xmath104d36 targeted as part of the des science verification period .",
    "the availability of ancillary multi - wavelength photometric data as well as large spectroscopic samples in this field , allows us to validate the quality of our photometric catalogues and assess their utility for a range of science applications .",
    "the vhs forced photometry catalogues are shown to be robust to within a few per cent to changes in the photometric processing pipeline and the errors on the photometry are dominated by the random sky noise .",
    "we demonstrate that using the deep des detection images to extract fluxes from the vhs images at the des positions results in a factor of @xmath24.5 increase in the number of sources with optical+nir photometry . while a simple catalogue match between des and vhs provides @xmath210,000/deg@xmath8 galaxies with joint optical and nir photometry , performing forced photometry allows us to increase this number to @xmath245,000 galaxies / deg@xmath8 albeit now with lower average signal - to - noise in the infrared .",
    "almost 70% of des sources in this field have useful nir flux measurements through the forced photometry .",
    "we show that the near infrared colours of galaxies in this forced photometry catalogue are consistent with templates generated from deep photometry in the cosmos field . by matching our catalogue to deep near infrared data from the vista video survey",
    ", we show that the number counts agree very well with the video data over the magnitude range over which the two surveys overlap but the des detections allow us to probe @xmath21.5 mag deeper in the near infrared compared to the vhs 5@xmath17 catalogues . in this paper",
    "we assess how useful this joint catalogue is for a range of science applications , concentrating in particular on photometric redshifts and target selection for future wide - field spectroscopic surveys .    the addition of near infrared vhs data to des photometry results in a modest improvement in the overall photometric redshift performance in particular reducing the scatter on the photometric redshift by @xmath27 - 12% ( depending on the metric used to compute this scatter ) .",
    "we find that the vhs data allow us to quantify both the bias and scatter on the photometric redshift to better accuracy than with des alone and note that there is some evidence that the vhs data are particularly helpful in reducing the photometric redshift scatter at @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "while these results are encouraging , we caution that they are currently affected by the small number statistics of available spectroscopic samples overlapping the single field where we have conducted our analysis and are also sensitive to the photometric redshift algorithm used .",
    "our spectroscopic catalogues are over - represented at low redshifts and bright magnitudes where galaxy photometric redshifts are already well estimated with optical data .",
    "while we have attempted to correct for this bias by weighting the spectroscopic sample such that it has the same magnitude distribution as our photometric sample , in this single field , the results could be strongly influenced by a small number of highly weighted galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , the photometric redshift analysis conducted here suggests that the vhs forced photometry is likely to improve the photometric redshift estimates from des alone , particularly when larger samples with higher fractions of both high - redshift and intrinsically red galaxies become available .",
    "we introduce a simple des+vhs colour selection scheme for the identification of high redshift luminous red galaxies .",
    "our proposed selection in the @xmath47 colour - colour plane gives @xmath2900 targets per sq - deg down to a magnitude limit of @xmath58 . by matching these targets to",
    "existing spectroscopic databases as well as aaomega observations of this field obtained as part of the ozdes project , we verify that the selection proves extremely effective in isolating high redshift lrgs with a median redshift of 0.72 .",
    "contamination from non - lrgs is estimated to be @xmath60.5% for those objects with secure redshifts although we note that the contamination may be higher for the subset of objects where secure redshift identifications were not possible .",
    "this contamination is considerably lower than found using optical - only colour selection methods and the additional vhs fluxes are shown to be useful for discriminating between lrgs and galactic m - stars .    for the purposes of quasar selection we propose the use of des , vhs and _ wise _ catalogues . as des",
    "will not have @xmath25-band observations , quasars can not be separated from stars using the traditional uvx method which exploits the excess seen in quasar spectra relative to stars at uv wavelengths . instead , we make use of the kx method and propose a simple @xmath56 colour selection together with a _ wise _ colour cut for the identification of luminous quasars . our proposed selection gives a target density of @xmath270 bright quasars per sq - deg .",
    "once again utilising the many spectroscopic datasets over this field , we show that a large fraction ( @xmath240% ) of the bright quasar targets with secure redshifts lie at @xmath59 and will therefore be suitable for ly@xmath46 forest measurements .",
    "contamination from stars and low redshift galaxies is estimated to be @xmath214% for the subset of quasar targets with robust redshift measurements and most of the remaining sources with secure redshift identifications correspond to quasars at @xmath68 .    we conclude that the des+vhs catalogues will form an important dataset for obtaining good photometric redshifts of galaxies in the southern hemisphere as well as aiding target selection for future wide - field spectroscopic surveys .",
    "the vhs data will also enable a range of other science investigations that will not be possible from des alone e.g. improved stellar masses for des galaxies , the identification of high redshift and highly reddened quasars and the discovery of cool , low - mass stars in our own milky way .",
    "joint photometry from des and vhs at the pixel level will eventually result in an optical+nir catalogue of more than 200 million galaxies and @xmath270 million point sources over 4500",
    "sq - deg of the southern sky .",
    "constructing these joint catalogues will therefore enhance the science possible from both surveys and contribute significantly to the landscape of wide - field photometric surveys in the southern hemisphere over the next decade .",
