    "by the early years of the twentieth century , several workers had calculated the expected precession of the orbit of the planet mercury based on the equations of newtonian mechanics taking into account the perturbing effects of other planets in the solar system .",
    "( see doolittle @xcite for a discussion of methods , a summary of results , and early references , and stewart @xcite for a recent discussion . )",
    "the prediction was for a precession of @xmath7 arcsec per century ( in a sun - centered coordinate system ) .",
    "observation found the actual precession to be @xmath8 arcsec per century , leaving @xmath9 arcsec per century unexplained .",
    "this discrepancy remained a mystery until 1915 , when einstein , in the course of the development of general relativity , calculated the weak - field expansion of his new theory and predicted an additional precession of just this amount .",
    "@xcite since then , the precession of mercury and the other planets has been used to place bounds on the size of additional hypothetical forces .",
    "examples of such forces include the `` anti - gravity '' due to the cosmological constant @xcite , forces associated with a distance dependence of the gravitational constant @xcite , forces proposed as alternatives to dark matter @xcite , forces proposed as phenomenological explanations of the pioneer anomaly @xcite , and forces induced from higher dimensional models @xcite or extensions of general relativity @xcite .    in most of the precession calculations ,",
    "the assumption of nearly - circular orbital motion has been made in order to simplify the calculations .",
    "we show in this work that such an approximation is not necessary , and give a simple formula for the calculation of the precession induced by any central force even for highly eccentric orbits .",
    "our result can be used to get numerical values for the precession in all cases , and analytic values for power - law and logarithmic potentials .",
    "since the exact precession values can differ from the nearly - circular values by a factor of two or more , significantly more precise results for constraints on proposed new forces can be obtained through use of the present work .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we review the case of nearly - circular orbits and give a derivation of the relevant precession formula . in sec .",
    "iii we develop a formula for the precession of non - circular orbits in the form of a one - dimensional integral . in sec .",
    "iv we apply our formula to obtain precession results for a perturbing force of yukawa form as a function of the yukawa range parameter and the orbital eccentricity . in sec .",
    "v we obtain analytic results for power - law and logarithmic potentials . finally , in sec .",
    "vi we discuss a number of examples of hypothetical central - force perturbations for which precession bounds are appropriate .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the keplerian case .",
    "the unperturbed orbit equation is @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are cylindrical coordinates in the orbital plane , @xmath13 is the gravitational constant , @xmath14 is the central mass , and @xmath15 is the angular momentum per unit mass of the orbiting body .",
    "the standard elliptical solution has the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the semilatus rectum of the orbital ellipse and @xmath3 is its eccentricity .",
    "the maximum and minimum distances from the orbiting body to the force center have the values @xmath18 the semimajor axis @xmath19 is thus related to the semilatus rectum according to @xmath20 so that @xmath21 . the period @xmath22 is given by kepler s third law : @xmath23 .",
    "in the limit of nearly circular orbits we can find an approximate solution to the orbital equation that displays the precession of the axes of the ellipse . in this approach",
    "we generalize the method of ohanian @xcite .",
    "we assume the presence of a radial perturbing force @xmath24 in addition to the usual newtonian gravitational force @xmath25 .",
    "the perturbed orbit equation takes the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "the unperturbed solution is given in ( [ unperturbed ] ) above .",
    "we assume that the eccentricity @xmath3 is small , and expand @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 . to first order in @xmath3 the orbit equation can be written as @xmath31 we try a solution @xmath32 \\right \\}\\ ] ] and find , to first order in the perturbation , that @xmath33 .",
    "it follows that the precession angle ( per revolution ) is @xmath34 .",
    "we notice immediately that a @xmath35 perturbation , having @xmath36 , gives no precession .",
    "if we write the perturbing force in terms of a potential @xmath37 we find that @xmath38 where we have expressed the potential @xmath39 in terms of @xmath40 .",
    "it follows that the precession @xmath41 can be written in terms of the potential as @xmath42 where we have used @xmath43 .",
    "this is equivalent to a formula for the nearly - circular precession that has been used by dvali , gruzinov , and zaldarriaga @xcite .    for a power - law perturbing potential @xmath44",
    "the results are particularly simple .",
    "the force has the form @xmath45 , and the precession ( per revolution ) is @xmath46 there is an interesting relationship between the precession angles for powers @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the precession when @xmath49 is @xmath50 so that @xmath51",
    "in this section we will obtain an expression for the precession valid for orbits of any eccentricity and explore some of its properties . in the following sections we will discuss the yukawa force as an example where numerical techniques are required , and we will find analytic results for a number of useful potentials .    we will use energy conservation to obtain a simple expression for the precession .",
    "the conserved energy for motion in potential @xmath52 has the form @xmath53 in terms of the more useful variable @xmath40 this is @xmath54 we solve for @xmath55 and integrate to obtain @xmath56 where the sign is determined by the position in the orbit ( increasing radius or decreasing radius ) .",
    "returning to the non - perturbed problem for a moment , we see that the turning points are the solutions @xmath57 to the equation @xmath58 the angle change for a full orbit ( twice the change for the interval @xmath59 to @xmath60 ) is @xmath61 as expected .",
    "explicit expression for @xmath62 are not needed in the evaluation of this integral .",
    "we are now prepared to write down the general expression for the angle increase per complete radial oscillation ( @xmath63 from smallest to largest and back to smallest ) .",
    "it is @xmath64 where @xmath65 are the zeros of @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "the precession per revolution is thus @xmath68",
    ".    we will need approximate values for the zeros @xmath65 .",
    "we note that the expression @xmath69 can be written as @xmath70 we write @xmath71 , and find that the first - order shifts in the positions of the zeros are given by @xmath72    it is useful to express @xmath69 with its zeros explicitly displayed as @xmath73 it is clear that @xmath74 is small , of the order of the perturbation , since @xmath69 can also be written as in ( [ first_form_d ] ) and @xmath67 .",
    "an explicit approximation for @xmath74 can be found by equating the two forms for @xmath69 .",
    "we find that @xmath75 we note that the numerator of @xmath76 vanishes when @xmath77 and when @xmath78 , so @xmath76 is non - singular for the whole physical range @xmath79 . with this expression for @xmath69 ,",
    "the precession can be written as @xmath80    a number of consistency checks can be applied to this result .",
    "first , we notice that @xmath76 vanishes when either @xmath81 ( no force ) or @xmath82 ( a contribution to the @xmath35 force ) , so there is no precession in these cases . also , we can work out the precession for a nearly - circular orbit as a limiting case of ( [ general_result_1 ] ) for @xmath83 .",
    "when @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath63 are all similar , we can use a series expansion to show that @xmath86 .",
    "the corresponding precession , from ( [ general_result_1 ] ) , agrees with our earlier result ( [ near_circ_result ] ) . for a power - law perturbing potential @xmath44",
    ", the change of variable @xmath87 relates @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we find that @xmath90 which is the generalization of ( [ circular_power_relation ] ) to non - circular orbits . here",
    "@xmath91 is the semiminor axis .",
    "occasionally it is more convenient to express the perturbation as a force instead of a potential , for instance when the phenomenological perturbing force has a complicated structure or is given as an anomalous acceleration .",
    "our precession result ( [ general_result_1 ] ) can be rewritten in terms of the force by means of an integration by parts ( using @xmath92 ) in the form @xmath93 an additional advantage of this form is the absence of the potentially troublesome factor @xmath94 in the denominator . for practical use",
    "it is convenient to use a dimensionless integration variable with a fixed range .",
    "we define @xmath95 , and find @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the perturbing force at radius @xmath98 .",
    "an alternative expression for the precession , in terms of the potential , is @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the perturbing potential at radius @xmath98 .",
    "a general consequence of either form ( [ general_result_2 ] ) or ( [ general_result_3 ] ) is the fact that the precession @xmath101 contains only even powers of the eccentricity @xmath3 .",
    "this is true because only even powers of @xmath102 contribute in the integrals , and @xmath3 and @xmath102 are tied together in the definition of @xmath103 .",
    "of course , celestial dynamics is an exceedingly well - developed discipline , and expressions equivalent to ( [ general_result_2 ] ) and ( [ general_result_3 ] ) can be derived from the formulas of orbital perturbation theory given in the standard texts ( see for example danby @xcite ) .",
    "landau and lifshitz @xcite give a precession result in an alternative , but also equivalent , form .",
    "we have found the expressions ( [ general_result_2 ] ) and ( [ general_result_3 ] ) useful for further developments .",
    "the yukawa potential @xmath104 of strength @xmath105 and range @xmath106 is a field - theory - motivated @xcite assumption for a correction to the gravitational force . in this section",
    ", we work out the precession due to a perturbation of yukawa form .",
    "the precession @xmath107 due to a yukawa perturbation depends on two parameters : a range parameter @xmath108 and the eccentricity .",
    "it seems difficult to obtain an analytic form for @xmath107 , so we work numerically instead .",
    "use of either ( [ general_result_2 ] ) or ( [ general_result_3 ] ) leads to the integral form @xmath109     for the yukawa potential as a function of the range parameter @xmath110 and eccentricity @xmath3 .",
    "the contour lines are at @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",
    "the darkest ( lightest ) shading corresponds to the smallest ( largest ) values for the relative precession .",
    "the medium gray shown on the left side of the plot corresponds to values near one . as expected , the largest variations from one occur for large eccentricity .",
    "surprisingly , there is a range of @xmath110 for which the relative precession is depressed from its @xmath115 value.,width=384 ]    the small-@xmath3 limit of this , obtained either as the first non - vanishing term in an expansion in @xmath3 or by use of ( [ near_circ_result ] ) directly , is @xmath116 we take @xmath117 to set the scale for the yukawa precession , and focus instead on the effect of eccentricity encoded in the relative precession @xmath118 where @xmath119 the integral for the relative precession is @xmath120 the relative precession can give an important correction to the zero - eccentricity result .",
    "for example , the relative precession of the asteroid icarus ( with eccentricity e=0.827 ) with a yukawa perturbation having range parameter @xmath121 would be @xmath122 .",
    "the general behavior of @xmath118 as a function of its parameters is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "for most values of its parameters @xmath123 , and the constraints on the yukawa strength parameter @xmath105 from precession bounds are strengthened by taking the eccentricity dependence of @xmath118 into account .",
    "for some perturbing potentials it is possible to obtain analytic precession results . in this section",
    "we work out the analytic results for power law and logarithmic perturbations .",
    "there are known expressions for the precession due to a few particular power law perturbations .",
    "the small - field expansion of general relativity , valid outside a spherically symmetric mass , leads to a potential proportional to @xmath124 .",
    "a constant force has a potential proportional to @xmath103 .",
    "also , a uniform dark energy force is modeled by a potential proportional to @xmath125 .",
    "we give a general expression for a perturbative potential @xmath44 that contains these results as special cases .    for a power law potential",
    "we take @xmath44 , and apply ( [ general_result_3 ] ) .",
    "it turns out to be easiest to work first with a negative exponent . in particular , for a potential @xmath126 , the precession is @xmath127 the integral can be done by expanding @xmath128 in a series and integrating term by term .",
    "one finds that @xmath129 in the first step here we made use of the fact that only even powers of @xmath102 survive the integration .",
    "our complete result then for negative powers is @xmath130 where @xmath131 the precession for positive powers can be obtained by using ( [ elliptical_power_relation ] ) or the hypergeometric identity @xcite @xmath132 and is @xmath133 we have chosen to write @xmath101 in terms of the semilatus rectum @xmath134 for negative powers and in terms of the semimajor axis @xmath19 for positive powers in order to simplify the formulas .",
    "we note that expressions ( [ power_law_negative ] ) and ( [ power_law_positive ] ) are in fact both valid for all @xmath47 .",
    "the hypergeometric function @xmath135 terminates whenever one of its first two arguments is zero or a negative integer , which happens for any natural number @xmath47 . more generally ,",
