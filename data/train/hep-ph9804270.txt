    "unitarity and analyticity require the addition of an imaginary part thereby providing total widths for the resonances as well as giving some curvature to the trajectories .",
    "the modest aim of our work is as follows . using the positivity of the imaginary part and the positivity of the slope",
    ", it is observed that the real parts of trajectories can rise no faster than linearly .",

    "physically , our hypothesis embodies the dictum that _",
    "`` strong interactions are as strong as they can be''_. it is also satisfactory mathematically since a small imaginary part can only curve @xmath7 downwards from linearity .",
    "the limit @xmath2 equals zero corresponds to no imaginary part and a linear real trajectory .",
    "implications of the resulting deviations from linearity are studied for the real parts to discover significant changes in the intercept , in agreement with experimental observations . on the other hand ,",
    "analysis of the imaginary parts leads us to a pleasing result that total widths of high mass resonances grow linearly with mass , a fact which we show to be true experimentally , @xcite , both for mesons and for baryons .",

    "hence , we have proof ad absurdum .",
    "a similar derivation holds also for the lower bound condition : @xmath19    our hypothesis of maximum complexity may be written in the following suggestive `` renormalized '' form ( s )  |(s )  z(s ; ) [ maxco1 ] where , @xmath20 symbolizes the real , linear `` unrenormalized '' trajectory and @xmath21 is the complex``renormalization '' factor with the boundary conditions    l z(s;=0)=1 +     [ maxcol2 ] the above eq.(6 ) makes both re and i m @xmath0 to grow like @xmath1 , and the asymptotic phase of @xmath22 goes to a constant .",
    "this leads total widths to grow like @xmath23 as shown below .",
    "writing the contribution of a trajectory to an angular momentum @xmath24 partial wave amplitude as t(j , s)= , [ amp1 ] and comparing it to a breit - wigner form for a given @xmath24 resonance , it is easily seen that for a resonance of mass @xmath25 and total width @xmath26 ( m^2 ) (m^2 ) m _",

    "let us write a dispersion relation for @xmath28 , normalize @xmath29 at a threshold called @xmath30 and impose that it has a zero at @xmath31 : ( s)=()(^2 ) e^ [ dr ] where @xmath32 .",

    "for this case , the integrals in eq.([dr ] ) can be done explicitly for the three different regions :    * * region i * : @xmath37 . + for @xmath37 , @xmath38 is complex . hence both the real and the imaginary part of the pole are different from zero .",

    "the model exhibits two main features .",
    "first , as our initial conditions required , the pole function has a positive imaginary part vanishing at threshold .",
    "secondly , the slopes for the space and time - like regions do differ once the trajectories acquire an imaginary part .",
    "in fact , as confirmed by experimental data in @xmath5 charge exchange , the slopes are larger in the space - like region .",
    "above threshold ( region i for which @xmath37 ) , the formula for the imaginary part may more conveniently be written as follows ( s)= ( ^p ) ( s ) [ i m a ] for high mass time - like limit ( @xmath44 ) , eq.([ima ] ) leads to a very simple expression ( s)= ( s ) [ imaapp ] according to the previous eq.([imaapp ] ) , the imaginary part of the pole would be essentially linear with the squared energy just as the real part .",
    "we verify this behavior for various meson and baryon resonances .    in figure 1",
    ", we analyze experimental data for the @xmath45 resonances . on the left side",
    "we show the real part of the trajectory ( @xmath24 vs @xmath46 ) through resonance masses . on the right side",
    "we show the corresponding imaginary part ( as given by eq.([amp2 ] ) ) employing the total widths of the @xmath45 resonances , versus the squared mass values of the @xmath45 resonances .",
    "as we can see , the asymptotic limit described in eq.([imaapp ] ) holds for this system quite accurately .",
    "the slope of re @xmath22 is found to be around 0.88 @xmath47 and the slope of i m @xmath22 is found to be around @xmath48 confirming that the @xmath2 parameter in eq.([imaapp ] ) is indeed quite small ( about a few percent ) .",
    "earlier trnqvist , @xcite , had found a similar systematics for the total widths of light mesons purely phenomenologically .",
    "wherever our regge analysis overlaps with his , we are in complete agreement .      in order to be able to use all resonance data lying on a given trajectory , including those for which threshold corrections are substantial , it is convenient to use the following expression for the total width , =( ) [ width ] where = [ rhoeff ] and @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 .",
    "we note that    * for a low mass resonance , such as the @xmath4 , the above expression differs from its asymptotic limit by a factor two ; * for the @xmath52 resonance the width is quite small since its primary decay via the @xmath53 channel occurs only through the lower tail of the @xmath4 .",
    "an effective mass for @xmath54 mev has been used ; * for @xmath55 , the effective threshold factor has been determined through its p- wave decay ( @xmath56 ) into @xmath57 and its s- wave decay ( @xmath58 ) into @xmath59 channel ; * similarly , for @xmath60 , the effective threshold has been determined through its decay @xmath61 each into @xmath62 ( p- wave ) and @xmath63 ( s- wave ) .    in figure",
    "( 2 ) , we show a plot of @xmath64 for light flavoured mesonic systems ( the @xmath4 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 recurrences ) and baryonic systems ( the @xmath68 , @xmath45 , @xmath30 and @xmath69 recurrences ) .",
    "since the input total widths ranged over a factor of a hundred , it is fair to conclude that much order has been restored for each system and moreover a not too dissimilar asymptotic value for all the light systems can be inferred .",
    "as stated earlier , slopes for the space and time - like regions of the real part of the trajectory differ once the trajectories acquire an imaginary part .",
    "the slope is seen to be larger in the space - like region , according to eqs.([t1]),([f1]),([fi1 ] ) and ( [ f3 ] ) .    the most suitable example to check the different values for the slope",
    "is given by the @xmath4 trajectory , where analyses of experimental data have been performed in both regions .",
    "the time - like slope is found to be around @xmath70 , @xcite . to infer the space - like slope",
    ", we turn to the high - energy limit of @xmath71 . here",
    "the @xmath4 trajectory exchange ought to be a good approximation being the only one with the right t - channel quantum numbers .",
    "earlier analyses of the differential cross section for the above scattering had revealed that the effective @xmath4 trajectory for negative t acquires a curvature and if linearity is imposed , one is led to a larger value for the slope near s=0 : @xmath72 in @xcite , @xmath73 in @xcite and @xmath74 in @xcite .    our model describes the above picture quite well . in figure ( 3 ) experimental data for the masses of the @xmath4 resonances and the analyses in @xcite for the space - like @xmath4 trajectory are plotted again with predictions from our model , eqs.([t1]),([f1]),([fi1 ] ) and ( [ f3 ] ) .",
    "the full line is for @xmath75 , which would imply no variation for the slopes between the two regions .",
    "the dotted and dashed lines , which are for @xmath76 , describe data in both regions . the threshold factor which appears in eq.([t1 ] ) , was taken to be @xmath77 ; and @xmath78 .    for the above parameters , the intercept @xmath79 is found to be 0.525 , which is in good accord with the effective intercept value @xmath80 obtained through the total cross section analysis by donnachie and landshoff , @xcite .",
    "in this work we have shown how constraints due to analyticity and unitarity applied to a regge pole function lead to rather powerful predictions for the hadronic systems .",
    "an admittedly simple model for the phase consistent with positivity , the threshold and asymptotic conditions was presented which appears to work reasonably well .",
    "since the imaginary part of the pole is directly related to the total widths of the hadronic resonance states , quantitative predictions can be made once we know the @xmath2 parameter , i.e. value of the asymptotic phase . for @xmath45 and @xmath4 recurrences we found @xmath81 to be in good agreement with data .",
    "experimental data are consistent with our conjecture that the asymptotic phase has very nearly the same value for all of the light baryonic and mesonic sector .",
    "moreover , whenever the threshold factor is close to one , the imaginary part of the trajectory appears to be approximately linear just as the real part is .",
    "a more complete analysis shall be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "regarding the real part of the trajectory , we showed that the slopes for the space and time - like regions indeed differ enough to be measurable .",
    "the analysis was presented for the @xmath4 trajectory , where much data are available , both in the resonance region and in the space - like region through the @xmath5 charge exchange reaction .    999 - review of particle properties ( 1996 ) , i-720 .",
