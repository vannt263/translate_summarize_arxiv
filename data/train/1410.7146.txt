    "in physics and chemistry , we need to accurately estimate the long - range electrostatic interactions among charged and polar particles . to this end",
    ", a large number of simulations have been performed and the ewald method is a famous technique for efficiently summing these interactions using the fourier transformation @xcite . it has been used to investigate the bulk properties of charged and polar particles under the periodic boundary condition in three dimensions ( 3d ewald ) @xcite . it has also been modified for film - like systems under the periodic boundary condition in the lateral directions ( 2d ewald ) @xcite .",
    "several groups @xcite have performed simulations of dipole systems in electric field between parallel metal walls .",
    "however , not enough efforts have been made on dynamics , where applied electric field can be nonstationary .",
    "such nonequilibrium situations are ubiquitous and are of great scientific and practical importance .",
    "hence , this paper aims to give a general scheme of treating water under electric field and investigate the dielectric relaxation after field reversal .",
    "hautman et al.@xcite developed a 3d ewald method assuming parallel , smooth metal walls , where the constant potential condition is satisfied at the metal walls ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) and the periodic boundary condition is imposed along the @xmath5 and @xmath6 axes . in this case , each charged particle in the cell induces surface charges producing a potential equivalent to that from an infinite number of image charges outside the cell .",
    "perram and ratner @xcite found some relations on these image charges . in the same scheme ,",
    "klapp@xcite treated dipoles interacting with the soft - core potential to find wall - induced ordering .",
    "the present authors @xcite extended this 3d ewald method for charged and polar particles to examine surface effects , ionic crystals , dipole chains , and local electric field . in this paper",
    ", we use this method for water .",
    "we also mention other methods .",
    "shelley and patey @xcite assumed empty ( vacuum ) slabs outside the cell , which the particles can not enter due to the repulsive wall potentials . if the regions @xmath7 and @xmath8 are empty , the 3d ewald method can be used with period @xmath9 along the @xmath10 axis . also with empty slabs , yeh and berkowitz@xcite applied electric field accounting for the local field from net polarization .",
    "they found that the computing time with this 3d ewald method was ten times faster than that with the 2d ewald method . with such empty regions , however , charged or polar particles are effectively in contact with neutral , non - polarizable walls .",
    "siepmann and sprik @xcite assumed atomic particles forming a crystal and interacting with water molecules via a model potential at the surface .",
    "they varied charges of these atoms continuously to maintain the constant potential condition in metal .",
    "this model was used to study water and ions between electrodes with the aid of the 2d ewald method @xcite .",
    "et al._@xcite proposed an efficient simulation method accounting for the primary image charges closest to the boundary walls and uniform ( average ) surface charge densities .",
    "surface charges increase locally as charges or dipoles in the liquid region approach a metal wall . as a result ,",
    "water molecules are adsorbed and oriented near a metal wall@xcite .",
    "they form a stern surface layer @xcite even without ions , where the electric potential changes appreciably on a microscopic length .",
    "it also follows that the surface charges exhibit significant in - plane fluctuations with a correlation length @xmath11 .",
    "we shall see that the electric field due to these surface charges tends to be uniform in the bulk where the distances from the walls much exceeds @xmath11 .",
    "we are not aware of previous microscopic calculations to check the validity of the classical theory of dielectrics @xcite .",
    "hence , we calculate the average and fluctuations of the local electric field @xmath12 acting on each molecule @xmath13 . in particular , we consider a nanometer - size sphere surrounding each molecule . in our simulation ,",
    "the local field contribution from the sphere interior consists of an average ( a deviation from the classical lorentz field ) and large fluctuations ( @xmath14 with @xmath15 ) , while that from the sphere exterior is obtained from the continuum electrostatics with small fluctuations .",
    "we also present a first study of nonequilibrium water , where the polarization relaxes after a reversal of applied electric field . in this relaxation , rotational jumps with large angle changes play a major role .",
    "these largely rotated molecules form clusters causing breakage and reorganization of the hydrogen bond network . in previous simulations on water ,",
    "collective hydrogen - bond dynamics was studied at @xmath16 k @xcite and marked dynamic heterogeneities were observed in translation and rotation in supercooled states @xcite .",

    "ii , we will reexamine the ewald scheme for water between metal walls . in sec .",

    "\\(i ) in sec.ii , we have explained our simulation method .",
    "we have shown that the surface charges yield an electric potential consisting of the average part @xmath513 and a deviation @xmath110 , where @xmath514 is the mean surface charge at @xmath3 .",
    "then , each charge @xmath68 is acted by the field from the surface charges and the dipolar field @xmath130 from the other charges in the cell .",
    "we have expressed the electrostatic potential @xmath29 in terms of @xmath110 in eq 23 not using the image charges .",
    "if @xmath110 is negligible , we can justify the simulation methods by yeh and berkowitz@xcite and by petersen _",
