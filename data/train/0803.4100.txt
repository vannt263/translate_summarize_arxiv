    "the immense luminosity of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) means that in principle they could be observed to very high redshift ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) . they are associated with massive stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and there is accumulating evidence , albeit indirect , that they are preferentially ( although not exclusively ) found in lower - metallicity environments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it therefore seems likely that grbs will be produced even by the earliest generations of population ii stars in the universe , and possibly by population iii .",
    "this opens up the possibility that they could pinpoint the first luminous objects to form after the big bang ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "various authors have attempted to model early star formation and infer a likely grb rate as a function of cosmic time .",
    "although there are many uncertainties in these models ( which get larger as one attempts to push them earlier ) , they do predict that as many as @xmath3510% of  grbs could be at @xmath4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in broad agreement with observational findings to date @xcite , and help make the case that occasional grbs could be found at much higher redshifts .",
    "candidate high redshift bursts have normally been identified photometrically by a sharp break in the optical to near - infrared ( nir ) spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of their afterglow light .",
    "the presence of a strong break in the afterglow spectrum is indicative of high opacity due to ly@xmath5 absorption from neutral hydrogen clouds in the early universe .",
    "indeed this technique has already facilitated the identification of the high redshift afterglows of grb 050814 @xcite and grb 050904 @xcite , the latter of which was confirmed to be at @xmath6 by a deep optical spectrum @xcite .",
    "recently , grb 060927 was found at @xmath7 , and again its very red @xmath8 colour provided the first indication of extreme distance @xcite .    however , the situation can at times be more complicated . although grb afterglows generally produce clean power - law spectra , they are subject to reddening from interstellar dust , the imprint of which can mimic the ly@xmath5 break .",
    "this is especially problematic if the sed is poorly sampled , as is often the case due to the difficulty of obtaining deep simultaneous multi - band optical and nir photometry for many bursts , even when well placed for observation .",
    "hence , there may be some degeneracy between a burst that lies at high redshift , and one that is highly reddened by intervening dust . a large proportion of star - formation in the high - redshift universe is thought to be heavily dust obscured ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , leading to the expectation that many grbs , having short - lived progenitors , should occur in such regions .",
    "rather surprisingly , in practice , examples of even moderately high extinction are rather rare @xcite .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that grb hosts on the average seem to be less dusty than other populations of high-@xmath9 star - forming galaxies @xcite , and probably also because grbs destroy dust for considerable distances along our line - of - sight to them ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observational bias against discovering faint , dust reddened bursts is doubtless also a contributing factor at some level .",
    "indeed , @xcite have argued that the higher average excess hydrogen column ( @xmath10 ) ( and hence presumably obscuration ) inferred in bright  bursts compared to bepposax and hete2 , may be responsible for a dearth of @xmath11 in the  sample with measured redshifts ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in any event",
    ", the potential of grbs as high redshift probes has encouraged increasing efforts to obtain early nir followup of afterglows .",
    "many grbs have had no optical afterglow found , but only in a few cases were searches deep and early enough to make them interesting .",
    "here we present deep optical and nir observations of the afterglow of grb 060923a .",
    "the nir observations uncovered a very faint @xmath0-band afterglow only an hour after the burst , which was not visible in subsequent @xmath12 and @xmath13 band imaging .",
    "deep gemini observations show that the afterglow was also very faint in the optical .",
    "we discuss possible explanations of this extreme colour in context of both a high redshift and high extinction origin for the burst .",

    "the burst was of the long - duration class with @xmath14  s , and a photon index @xmath15 .",
    "the total fluence of the burst was @xmath16 ergs @xmath17 in the 15150 kev band , and peak photon flux in a 1  s bin was @xmath18  @xmath17  s@xmath19 @xcite .",

    "the x - ray afterglow initially declined rapidly with @xmath22 ( following the convention for flux density , @xmath23 ; and 90% errors ) and then entered a plateau phase for approximately 1 hour , finally settling into a shallower ( @xmath24 ) decay .",
    "fitting an absorbed power - law spectrum to the orbit 2 ( 1.2 to 1.9 hours post burst ) and orbit 3 ( 2.8 to 3.4 hours ) data we infer a spectral slope @xmath25 ( 90% errors ) and an effective column density of neutral hydrogen of @xmath26  @xmath17 ( @xmath27 errors and milky way abundance assumed ) , compared to a foreground estimated as @xmath28 @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "no counterpart was seen with the uv - optical telescope ( uvot ) to an unfiltered magnitude limit of about 18.5 .",

    "longer ftn observations over the next hour found deeper limits of around @xmath32 .",
    "we obtained our first @xmath0-band image at the 3.9  m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) on mauna kea at 06:07 ut , approximately 55 minutes after the burst , which was followed with a set of multicolour ( @xmath33 ) observations that began at 06:35 ut .",
    "these observations were reduced via the orac - dr pipeline ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "photometric calibration ( also for the other nir observations reported below ) was performed relative to three 2mass stars in the field . in these images we found a fading source in the @xmath0-band close to the x - ray centroid at position @xmath2016:58:28.16 , @xmath21 + 12:21:38.9 ( j2000 ; astrometric calibration tied to nomad 1.0 stars and accurate to 0.25 arcsec in each coordinate ) , which was not visible in either the @xmath12 or @xmath13 band observations . at @xmath34 within an hour of the burst , this is considerably fainter than previous afterglow detections in nir estimated at the same epoch .",
    "for example , the faint , red afterglow of grb 050215b was also only seen in @xmath0 , but would have been @xmath35 at 1 hour based on extrapolating back the later time decay curve @xcite .",
    "more optical observations were made at gemini north on mauna kea beginning at 07:19 ut ( 2.1 hours post burst ) in the sloan @xmath36 and @xmath37 filters .",

    "formally these data yielded no significant detection to deep limits , although there was marginal evidence of excess flux in the @xmath36 band .",
    "for such a faint afterglow , nir spectroscopy was not a feasible option , and further information could only be gained from imaging .",

    "( the location of the burst was such that it was only observable above 30@xmath38 altitude for about 90 minutes after the end of evening twilight for the northern observatories , and less in the south ) .",
    "the optical observations were again reduced via standard procedures using iraf tools ( in this case the sdss sequence magnitudes were transformed to cousins passbands via the equations of lupton ( 2005 ) , to provide a better match to the filters used ) , while isaac observations were processed with _",
    "eclipse_. these images provided a clearer detection of a faint , extended galaxy coincident with the afterglow position , the implications of which we discuss below .",

    "the former of these confirmed the host detection at @xmath41 , but also showed the burst to have occurred on the optically brightest region of the galaxy .",
    "a very faint continuum trace was seen in the optical spectrum extending at least as blue as 4600   , but there were no indications of any significant emission lines .",
    "the two ( early- and late - time ) isaac @xmath0-band images each showed marginal ( @xmath42 ) evidence of excess flux in an aperture centred on the afterglow location , and combining the two measures yields an estimated host magnitude of @xmath43 .    the discovery @xmath0-band image , and final vlt optical image showing the faint host , are shown in fig .",

    "[ default ]",
    "the extremely red colours of the afterglow implied by the non - detections in the optical suggest that the flux at wavelengths shortward of about 1.5  @xmath52 m is significantly suppressed ( see fig .",
    "[ sedfigure ] ) .",
    "relatively few grb afterglows exhibit such red colours @xcite .",
    "this is probably due to a combination of factors : for instance , grbs are expected to destroy dust ( especially the smaller grains ) for many parsecs along the line of sight ; and , despite increasingly effective nir campaigns , there is still some selection bias against picking up the reddened afterglows .",
    "however , most importantly , studies of grb host galaxies have found relatively few that exhibit signs of high dust content .",
    "for example , the number with detectable submm emission is below that expected based on the proportion of global star formation thought to take place in ultra - luminous dusty galaxies @xcite .",
    "similarly mm observations at iram ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and mir observations with _ spitzer _",
    "@xcite also find that grb hosts have relatively little emission on the average .",
    "a small number of grbs have taken place in extremely red galaxies ( eros ) at moderate redshifts , which is presumably indicative of dust reddening ( ( e.g .",
    "grb  030115 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( grb  020127 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) , but even these cases are not massive dusty galaxies judged by their far - ir emission @xcite .",
    "the rare red afterglows are likely to be the result of either extreme reddening or high redshift .",
    "we discuss each of these possibilities in relation to grb  060923a below .",
    "as discussed above , highly reddened afterglows and dusty host galaxies are rare amongst grbs observed to date . from fig .",
    "[ eiso ] we see that the energetics of the burst are such that the prompt emission would not be extreme even if it originated at @xmath53 .",
    "the afterglow is faint in all bands , consistent with a high-@xmath9 interpretation .",
    "similarly , the rest - frame duration of the prompt emission would have been about 5  s at such redshifts , quite reasonable for a long grb .    although the @xmath13 band limit from our short ukirt exposure is not very constraining , it is clear from fig .",
    "[ sedfigure ] that in the absence of dust extinction , a redshift around @xmath54 or greater is required to explain the red @xmath55 colour of the afterglow . as discussed below , however , the detection of a host galaxy in the optical rules out this possibility .      the discovery of a host galaxy in the optical suggests a moderate redshift , and specifically the detection in our fors1 spectrum of light down to @xmath56     indicates @xmath2 , since above that redshift the ly@xmath5 forest should render invisible the already weak continuum trace ( a harder upper bound @xmath57 comes from the lyman limit ) .",
    "in fact , the magnitude and colour of the galaxy are entirely typical of other long - duration grb hosts @xcite . at first sight",
    "it may seem somewhat surprising that the host colour , @xmath58 , is not unusually red if the afterglow is highly reddened .",
    "this could be explained geometrically , for example if we are viewing the burst through an edge - on disk or it is embedded in an extended star - forming complex where either the dust is patchy and widely distributed , or its scale length is longer than can be destroyed by the prompt uv flash from the burst itself .",
    "interestingly , low surface brightness ",
    "filaments \" can be seen extending south - east and south - west of the bright knot for several arcseconds ( fig .",
    "[ mosaicimage ] , lower panel ) .",
    "this would be unusually large if it is all part of a single host , but might indicate a merger or interacting morphology .",
    "this in turn could have triggered star formation , some of it dust enshrouded , producing the bright knot and the grb progenitor .",
    "however , even prior to identification of the likely host , there were a number of reasons to doubt the very high redshift hypothesis .",
    "in particular , the significant excess column density above the galactic foreground , inferred from the x - ray spectrum . at very high-@xmath9 the rest - frame soft x - rays move out of the /xrt bandpass , so even high columns in the host will produce little attenuation ( presumably exacerbated by the low metallicity at early cosmic times ) .",
    "for example , in the sample of 55  long - duration bursts with redshifts considered by @xcite , none of those above @xmath59 showed such a high excess column as seen here .",
    "we should caution , however , that the reliability of column densities derived from evolving x - ray afterglow spectra has been questioned by @xcite . this could be particularly relevant if truly at high-@xmath9 since time - dilation would mean the xrt was observing early in the rest - frame .",
    "however , the faintness and redness of the afterglow in the nir bands , and the fact that the spectral slope between the nir and x - ray , @xmath60 , also requires a strong spectral break , can all be explained most easily if there is significant dust attenuation even in @xmath0 .",
    "we illustrate this further with the inset panel in fig .",
    "[ sedfigure ] , which shows a combined fit to the x - ray and nir data . the model in this case",
    "is fixed at @xmath61 , and assumes smc extinction law , metallicity and gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "the unabsorbed spectrum is a @xmath62 power - law which breaks to @xmath63 . in fact",
    "this cooling break must be close to , or in the xrt band to provide a good simultaneous fit .    more generally , in fig .",
    "[ av ] we show how several constraints on the afterglow properties would vary with assumed redshift . for simplicity , and to reduce the number of free parameters , we assume here an smc dust extinction law and gas - to - dust ratio of @xmath64 atoms  @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the solid line shows the rest - frame extinction required to produce @xmath65 from an intrinsic @xmath62 afterglow spectrum ( equivalent to @xmath66 , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in a rather model independent way , then , we can state that the afterglow should lie around this line or above it .",
    "the shaded region shows the foreground - subtracted  column density ( the @xmath27 full range ) derived by assuming the curvature of the x - ray spectrum is due to absorption by heavy elements . for consistency",
    "we also assume smc metallicity here , so whilst the absolute scale may be wrong , the comparison of @xmath67 and @xmath68 should be valid .",
    "finally , the hatched region shows the results of model fitting to the combined x - ray and k - band data . specifically , we extracted a /xrt x - ray spectrum such that its observation log midpoint coincided with the time of the k band photometry .",
    "we fitted these together in count space ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with models consisting of an absorbed power law or absorbed broken power law .",
    "a single power law is ruled out from the fits , unless the gas - to - dust ratio is very low .",
    "the broken power law high energy slope was fixed at a spectral index of @xmath69 as found in fits to the x - ray spectrum alone .",
    "the lower energy slope was fixed at @xmath70 as expected for a cooling break in the standard fireball model @xcite .",
    "below @xmath71 the fit becomes unacceptably poor ( @xmath72% from a @xmath73 test ) .",
    "the region shown is curtailed at the upper end at @xmath74 based on the limits from the optical spectrum discussed below .",
    "the vertical extent of the region represents the 90% error range on @xmath67 .",
    "we note that the hatched area is essentially consistent with the requirement of a reddened afterglow ( above the solid curve ) .",
    "the part of the hatched region which does not coincide with the grey shaded band corresponds to best fitting models where the curvature of the x - ray spectrum is partly due to a cooling break , hence reducing the required absorption .",
    "in fact , the hardness ratio for the orbit 2 spectrum is consistent with that for orbit 3 and also for the combined spectrum beyond orbit 3 , providing no evidence for a moving spectral break , but the statistics are too poor to make a firm statement .    we could , of course , have allowed more freedom in the model fitting , for example by not fixing the gas - to - dust ratio . however , allowing this to be a free parameter finds models with lower @xmath10  column at a given extinction , whereas , for long grb afterglows , the columns determined from x - rays are more often in excess of those determined from the reddening ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a larger than expected cooling break ( @xmath75 ) could in principle reduce the required extinction , but then we would not explain the reddening of the afterglow . in any case , even with greater freedom it is hard to find any reasonable solution at @xmath76 .",
    "we conclude that the burst likely occurred at @xmath77 , which , combined with the constraint @xmath2 , requires @xmath78 .",
    "this extinction would be high by typical grb standards , but quite moderate compared to sight lines close the plane of a disk galaxy or through large dust - enshrouded star - forming regions .",
    "we note that , whilst not common , optically dark bursts in blue galaxies at moderate redshifts , have been identified before , for example , grb  970828 @xcite , grb  000210 @xcite , grb  051022 @xcite and grb  070306 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it remains odd that the location of the burst in this case places it within @xmath79  arcsec , corresponding to at most a kiloparsec or two ( at any plausible redshift ) , of the optically brightest part of the host . this strong spatial coincidence between burst position and the optically brightest regions of their hosts",
    "is seen in many other low - reddening long grbs @xcite , and may be a consequence of the very short life - times of massive - star grb progenitors , which do not move far from the star - forming region of their birth @xcite . in the case of grb  060923a , unless there is some separation along the line - of - sight , we require the dust - attenuated grb to be close to a relatively unreddened region that dominates the optical light of the galaxy .",
    "a plausible geometry is one in which high optical - depth molecular clouds provide patchy obscuration of a large star - forming complex ( cf .",
    "ngc 604 in m33 as a possible low - redshift analogue ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the sight - line to the grb happens to intersect one of these .",
    "there is great interest in grbs with very red optical - nir colours since they could be at very high redshift .",
    "grb 060923a is arguably the most extreme example found to - date , being detected in the k - band , but with only deep limits in early observations in all bluer filters .",
    "if purely due to a ly@xmath5 break in the near - ir , this would indicate a redshift beyond @xmath80 .",
    "however , our later - time optical observations revealed a faint galaxy , presumably the host , at the same position , which must be at a more moderate redshift , probably @xmath2 but certainly not above @xmath81 .",
    "the morphology of the host : a bright knot coincident with the grb itself , and extended low surface brightness features may indicate a merger / interaction has produced this burst of star formation .",
    "a combined analysis of the x - ray and optical / nir data suggest that the burst is also likely to have @xmath77 in order to reconcile the absorption required in both bands .",
    "there is , of course , a slim chance that the grb is coincident with an unrelated foreground galaxy . following the analysis of @xcite we calculate a probability that the afterglow would be found coincident with an unrelated galaxy as bright as @xmath82 to be about 3%  a small but non - negligible figure .",
    "however given the close alignment of the afterglow with the brightest knot of the galaxy , and that the colour and magnitude of the putative host are otherwise very plausible for a typical long - duration grb , the conservative explanation remains that this is a case of dust rather than distance .",
    "grb  060923a nonetheless is likely to be representative of some proportion of the dark grb population which optical surveys are biased against finding .",
    "it is therefore also a good example of the kind of interlopers which we must be able to reject in order to identify very high redshift grbs .",
