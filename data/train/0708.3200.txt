    "modification of the al surface properties by deposition of different kinds of atoms has been studied both experimentally@xcite and theoretically.@xcite specifically , the deposition of au atoms on the al(001 ) surface , which is the subject of our present work , has been studied experimentally@xcite and to our knowledge , there is no report in the literature on theoretical work .",
    "the analysis of the experiment conducted by egelhoff  @xcite had shown that for sufficiently high coverages ( around 10  ml ) , the au atoms had been deposited on the al(001 ) surface in the form of clusters which is different from the layer - by - layer deposition .    in this work , we have studied the effects of deposition of gold atoms with low - coverages ( @xmath4 0.11 , 0.25 , 0.50 , 0.75 , 1.00  ml ) on the al(001 ) surface properties . at these low coverages ,",
    "the clustering effect would be negligible .",
    "for this purpose , we have carried out first - principles calculations within the density functional theory ( dft).@xcite our calculations for the clean al(001 ) surface shows outward relaxations for the interlayer spacings , consistent with the other _ ab initio _ calculations@xcite and the latest experiment.@xcite in the au / al(001 ) system , we have shown that the work - function , average binding energy , geometries , and induced surface dipole moments of the al(001 ) surface changes with increasing the surface density of au adatoms . since the electronegativity of au atom is higher than that of al atom ( 2.4 for au and 1.5 for al , see ref .  ) , adding au atoms on the al surface , pulls more electrons from the substrate and hence increases the magnitude of the surface dipole moment which , in turn , increases the work - function . however , by increasing the surface density of au adatoms , the induced dipole moment shows a decrease from @xmath1  ml to @xmath2  ml with a sharp dip at @xmath0=0.25  ml , a maximum at @xmath0=0.50  ml , and a slow decrease up to @xmath0=1.00  ml .",
    "we have explained this behavior by analyzing the distribution of space charge of electrons and ions in the slab .",

    "we have used the quantum - espresso code@xcite for the electronic structure calculations of the bulk al , al(001 ) surface , and au / al(001 ) system .",
    "the calculations are based on the dft and the self - consistent solution of the kohn - sham ( ks)@xcite equations . for the exchange - correlation",
    ", we have used the gga of perdew _ et al _  @xcite ; and for the valence electrons of the al and au atoms , we have used the scalar - relativistic ultra - soft@xcite pseudo - potentials.@xcite for the al pseudo - potential , the electronic configuration @xmath5 with the same cut - off , @xmath6 a.u .",
    ", for both orbitals ; and for the au pseudo - potential , the electronic configuration @xmath7 with respective cut - offs @xmath8 a.u . were used .    to calculate the bulk properties of fcc al , we have tested different k - point samplings and energy cut - offs for the plane wave basis , and have performed the brillouin - zone integrations using the methfessel - paxton smearing@xcite with 0.05  ry of broadening for appropriate set of ( @xmath9 ) monkhorst - pack grid@xcite and a 38 ry cut - off for the plane wave basis set . using these parameters ,",
    "we have solved the self - consistent ks equations for different lattice constant values and obtained the equilibrium lattice constants as those minimizing the total energies .",
    "we have considered the atoms in their equilibrium state , when the forces on the atoms were converged to within 1  mry / a.u .",
    "the al(001 ) surface is modeled by a supercell composed of a 7 atomic layers with a ( @xmath10 ) surface unit cell ( with the surface - cell size taken from the bulk calculation ) and a vacuum region of 15 empty layers . the kinetic energy cut - off for the plane wave basis and the k - point mesh were chosen as 38 ry and ( @xmath11 ) , respectively .    for the au / al(001 ) system , using eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , we have first found the hollow sites as the preferred adsorption sites , and then a 7-layered al slab was taken as substrate .",
    "the au atoms were positioned above the preferred adsorption sites on the al(001 ) surface , and a vacuum region of 13 empty layers was taken .",
    "the surface structures of ( @xmath12)-au , ( @xmath13)-au , ( @xmath14)-au , ( @xmath13)-3au , and ( @xmath10)-au were chosen for coverages @xmath0=0.11 , 0.25 , 0.50 , 0.75 , and 1.00  ml , respectively . in order to preserve the inversion symmetry ,",
    "we have positioned the au atoms on both sides of the slab . for au adsorption on the al(001 ) surface ,",
    "the average binding energy per au atom is defined as @xmath15,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath16 is the total number of symmetrically adsorbed au atoms on the two sides of the slab ( @xmath17 on each side ) and @xmath18 is the total energy of an isolated au atom .",
    "@xmath19 is the total energy of a 7-layered al supercell having a @xmath20 surface unit cell with one al atom at each layer , and @xmath21 is the total energy of a supercell composed of a 7-layered al substrate and au adatoms with coverage @xmath0 and the surface structure of al(001)-@xmath22-@xmath23au . for example , in @xmath24  ml , @xmath21 is the total energy of a supercell composed of a 7-layered al substrate with 4 al atoms on each layer and 3 au atoms at each side of the slab .",
    "the surface structure in this case is al(001)-@xmath25 - 3au . the binding energy , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , is the energy that is gained upon adsorption of a free au atom on the al(001 ) surface . in this definition",
    ", a positive number indicates that the adsorption is exothermic with respect to the free au atom ; and a negative number indicates that it is endothermic ( i.e. , adsorption does not take place ) .",

    "side , a ( @xmath26 ) k - point mesh for the brillouin - zone integrations , and 38 ry for the cut - off energy of the plane - wave basis .",
    "this choice of k - point mesh was adopted so that the k - point density becomes the same as in the au bulk calculations .",
    "however , the result obtained using the gamma point alone was the same to within 2 decimals .",
    "on the other hand , choosing 7- and 9-layered al slabs and adsorption of 1 ml of au atoms in each case , the difference in the binding energies was within @xmath27 ev , and the difference in the equilibrium distance of au atom from the al surface was less than 0.01  @xmath28 . with these testings , we have chosen a 7-layered al slab as the substrate in our calculations ; a ( @xmath11 ) k - mesh , and 38 ry cut - off energy for studying the au adsorption with ( @xmath10 ) surface structure which corresponds to @xmath0=1  ml . in order to preserve the same k - point density for different coverages , we have used ( @xmath29 ) mesh for ( @xmath12)-au ( @xmath1  ml ) , ( @xmath30 ) mesh for ( @xmath13)-au ( @xmath2  ml ) , ( @xmath31 ) mesh for ( @xmath14)-au ( @xmath32  ml ) , and ( @xmath33 ) mesh for ( @xmath34)-3au ( @xmath24  ml ) surface structures .    in our supercell calculations , to calculate the work - function of a given surface , which is defined as the minimum energy needed to remove an electron from a crystal to a point outside that surface , we find the difference between the electrostatic potential in the middle of the vacuum region and the fermi energy of the slab . for more accurate results , we have considered sufficiently large vacuum region to prevent the overlap of the wave functions of the neighboring slabs .",
    "in order to analyze the bonding behavior for different coverages , we have considered the difference electron density@xcite , @xmath35 , which is sensitive to the changes in the charge density , and is defined as @xmath36 in which @xmath37 is the total electron density of the substrate - adsorbate system , @xmath38 is the total electron density of clean al(001 ) slab , and @xmath39 is the total electron density of the isolated au adlayer .    to evaluate the induced surface dipole moment due to au adsorption , we adopt two different methods . in method 1",
    ", we use the helmholtz equation ( in debye units),@xcite which is defined as @xmath40 in which @xmath41 is the area in @xmath42 per ( @xmath10 ) surface unit cell , @xmath43 is the work - function change in electron volts , and @xmath0 is the coverage . in method 2 , we resort to the self - consistent charge - redistributions and directly use the integration @xmath44,\\ ] ] in which @xmath45 is the integral of the self - consistent adsorbate - substrate charge density over the surface unit cell ( @xmath46 ) divided by @xmath47 ; and @xmath48 is the same average , but here of the superposition of the self - consistent charge density of the isolated substrate and the self - consistent charge density of the isolated au adlayer . the limits of the integral , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are , respectively , the position of the central layer of the substrate and the distance of the middle of the vacuum region from the central layer in the adsorbate - substrate system . here ,",
    "the position of the central layer of the isolated substrate is identified with the position of the central layer of the adsorbate - substrate system and the position of the isolated au adlayer is identified with the position of the au adlayer in the adsorbate - substrate system .",
    "therefore , because of fixed positions , the contributions of the ion charges of the au adlayer and the central layer ( in fact , in our case , the central as well as its first neighbor layers ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) cancel out .",
    "however , there is no such cancelation in the electronic charge density . in other words , in our 7-layered substrate , only the topmost two layers of the substrate contribute in the ionic redistribution . to apply eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , we use the discretized form @xmath51 in which @xmath52 is the distance of the slice of thickness @xmath53  @xmath28 from the slab center and @xmath54 is the change in the slice electronic charge .",

    "in order to study the adsorption of au atoms on al(001 ) surface , we had to consider first the bulk al , clean al(001 ) , and the isolated au atom .",
