    "at temperatures large compared to the intrinsic scale of qcd , @xmath4 , the running qcd coupling constant is small , and perturbation theory should be a useful tool for studying thermodynamic and dynamic properties of the theory .",
    "this is true in principle , at least .    in practice , there are obstacles to the use of perturbation theory .",
    "the first is that hot qcd has an intrinsically nonperturbative scale , at wave numbers @xmath5 , or length scales @xmath6 .",
    "( the running coupling @xmath7 should be evaluated at a scale of order @xmath8 . )",
    "the presence of nonperturbative physics at this scale has nothing to do with asymptotic freedom or the existence of the scale @xmath9 ; even at temperatures many orders of magnitude above @xmath9 , nonperturbative physics sets in at a scale only a little lower than the thermal scale , @xmath10 . some observables are not very sensitive to this infrared scale ; but any observable will be sensitive to this scale at some order in the coupling expansion .",
    "for instance , the debye screening length carries nonperturbative corrections which are suppressed by only one power of @xmath11 @xcite ; photon emissivity is believed to receive nonperturbative corrections suppressed by @xmath7 @xcite ; and the baryon number violation rate arises entirely from nonperturbative physics , and is sensitive at leading order @xcite .",
    "the measurables which show thermal effects with the least sensitivity to the nonperturbative scale are the standard thermodynamic parameters , such as pressure , entropy density , and energy density . for these quantities ,",
    "perturbation theory can determine all coefficients up to @xmath12 , and that calculation has been carried out @xcite .",
    "( it is also possible to compute the @xmath13 term , and this is in progress @xcite . ) with the coefficients of the pressure up to @xmath12 in hand , one can diagnose the quality of the perturbative expansion , by seeing how quickly successive partial sums converge . here",
    "we meet the other problem of perturbation theory at finite temperature ; even when the perturbative series exists to some order , it shows very poor convergence .",
    "this problem is distinct from the presence of nonperturbative magnetic physics ; for instance it also appears in hot qed , which is free of strongly coupled ir behavior @xcite .",
    "recently this problem has received renewed attention .",
    "three groups have proposed reorganizations or partial resummations of the thermal perturbative expansion , which are hoped to improve the convergence , and therefore the utility , of perturbation theory .",
    "andersen , braaten , and strickland , following an earlier proposal by karsch _",
    "_ in scalar field theories @xcite , have proposed to do so by adding the hard thermal loop ( htl ) lagrangian to the action at tree level and subtracting it again with a counterterm treated as formally higher order , a technique they call hard thermal loop perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "blaizot , iancu , and rebhan have proposed a technique based on 2pi @xmath14 derivable methods , together with a set of approximations to render the method tractable , also based on hard thermal loops @xcite .",
    "a similar proposal was recently made by peshier @xcite .",
    "all three groups have produced predictions for the qcd pressure , both for pure glue and for qcd with fermions .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to judge whether the techniques are successful , since all we know independently about the qcd pressure are the perturbative series , which is only useful at uninterestingly weak coupling , and lattice results from the bielefeld group @xcite , which are only at such large coupling that it is not clear whether the resummation techniques should still work .",
    "the resummation techniques have also been applied to scalar field theory , but in that case exact results are only known for o(@xmath15 ) scalar theory at large @xmath15 , which is an almost trivial theory .    for this reason",
    "we think it advantageous to have accurate results for the pressure , in a theory as close to qcd as possible . in this paper",
    "we present a calculation of the thermal pressure in qcd with a large number of fermions , @xmath0 , at next to leading order ( nlo ) in a large @xmath1 expansion and for general @xmath3 , which is treated as @xmath16 .",
    "this theory contains a great deal of the physics of qcd ; for instance , the gauge fields are screened by the plasma with the same complicated frequency and momentum dependence as in full qcd .",
    "the perturbative series for the pressure shows poor behavior , as in full qcd .",
    "of course , some of the interesting physics of full qcd is absent at nlo in this expansion .",
    "this is unfortunate ; but on the other hand it is what allows us to solve this theory . for previous exact results in 6 dimensional scalar theory ,",
    "see @xcite ( who encountered some similar issues , regarding landau singularities , to those present here ) .",
    "we should emphasize now that , since all of the physics of large @xmath1 qcd is also present in full qcd , any approximation which shows poor performance in large @xmath1 qcd can not be expected to be valid for full qcd either .",
    "the reverse need not be the case ; an approximation which works at large @xmath1 may stumble over the physics which is left out in the large @xmath1 expansion .",
    "therefore , an approximation s performance against our results should be considered an optimistic estimate of its performance in full qcd .    in the next section",
    ", we will explain what we mean by large @xmath1 qcd . in section [ sec :",
    "compute ] , we describe how the calculation of the qcd pressure is carried out in this theory .",
    "our results and conclusions are presented in section [ sec : results ] , but we very briefly summarize them here . at small effective coupling @xmath3 ,",
    "the pressure is close to the free theory value , and perturbation theory works well .",
    "as the effective coupling is increased , @xmath17 falls at first , but eventually rises ; it becomes of order its free theory value about where landau pole ambiguities become uncomfortably large .",
    "the entropy shows the same behavior .",
    "it is difficult to obtain such behavior in an ideal quasiparticle approximation , such as the model of peshier , kmpfer , pavlenko , and soff @xcite .",
    "by large @xmath1 qcd , we mean qcd with the number of colors @xmath18 taken as fixed and @xmath16 , but with the number of fermionic species @xmath1 taken large and the gauge coupling @xmath7 taken small , so that the combination @xmath3 , which serves as an effective coupling strength , remains fixed and @xmath16",
    ". therefore , in @xmath1 counting , a factor of @xmath7 is treated as @xmath19 .",
    "this procedure is appropriate because it is the effective coupling which determines the convergence of perturbation theory .    in the following",
    "it will be useful to define @xmath20 as @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the quadratic casimir of the representation containing the fermions and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the dimensions of the fermionic and adjoint representations . in su(@xmath18 )",
    "gauge theory but with adjoint fermions , @xmath25 .",
    "other than overall factors involving @xmath18 , all the nontrivial coupling dependence of the pressure and entropy which we will find will depend on @xmath20 .",
    "note that @xmath20 is renormalization point dependent ; at leading order in @xmath1 its renormalization point dependence is , @xmath26 there are no corrections involving higher powers of @xmath20 ; all corrections to this relation are suppressed by at least one power of @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , one can solve completely for the scale dependence of @xmath20 , at leading order in @xmath27 ; @xmath28 clearly the theory has a landau pole at @xmath29 .",
    "we will define @xmath30 so that the gauge field propagator diverges at @xmath31 ; under this definition , @xmath32 . there is no hope that some strong coupling dynamics somehow generate a strongly coupled uv fixed point , because eq .",
    "( [ eq : scale_dep ] ) is exact at leading order in @xmath27 .",
    "therefore the theory technically does not exist .",
    "this problem is fatal if @xmath33 ; but for @xmath34 we argue that it is not .",
    "the landau pole means that the theory as such becomes ill defined ; but it is possible to `` rescue '' the theory by introducing either additional heavy degrees of freedom or high dimension operators , if they arise at a scale @xmath35 .",
    "for instance , if the operator @xmath36 is added to the lagrangian with coefficient greater than 1 , the gauge propagator becomes nonsingular at all energies , which is sufficient for our nlo calculation to proceed .",
    "this term ruins the renormalizability of the theory , but in a way which will not appear in the nlo calculation of the pressure .",
    "what the landau pole does mean is , that the exact definition of the theory is ambiguous , and quantities like the entropy or the pressure are only completely well defined after the physics which resolves the landau singularity has been specified .",
    "the size of the ambiguity is , however , suppressed by a positive power of @xmath37 , which for the pressure at nlo turns out to be @xmath38 .",
    "so provided that @xmath30 is kept suitably larger than @xmath8 , the relative size of the ambiguity is tiny and can be ignored .",
    "as @xmath20 is increased , this new ambiguity remains tiny long after the convergence of perturbation theory for the pressure has broken down .",
    "therefore , we will forge ahead and compute the pressure , without specifying the uv completion ; but we will only work with values of @xmath39 for which @xmath40 , which proves abundantly sufficient to keep the relative ambiguity in the nlo pressure below @xmath41 .",
    "the other feature of large @xmath1 gauge theory which we should emphasize is , that the nonabelian nature of the theory is not very important .",
    "this is because the gauge field self - interactions carry powers of @xmath11 without introducing powers of @xmath1 .",
    "in particular the gauge self - interactions will have no relevance in the calculation we perform here , and first appear , in the pressure and entropy , at nnlo ( next to next to leading order ) in @xmath27 .",
    "therefore our results will apply both to qed and qcd .",
    "in a relativistic field theory with vanishing chemical potentials , the pressure and free energy density are opposites , @xmath42 ; so we compute the pressure by computing the free energy , which equals the trace of the sum of all 1pi vacuum bubble graphs .",
    "this is to be done at finite temperature , which means in euclidean space with time extent @xmath43 , periodic boundary conditions for bosons , and antiperiodic boundary conditions for fermions . to get the _ thermal _ pressure , we subtract off the result at zero temperature ; the difference will be finite , though renormalization is still necessary because the result depends on the coupling @xmath20 and this coupling runs .",
    "= 5.5 in    at leading order , @xmath44 , there is only one diagram , a bare fermionic loop , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "its contribution to the pressure is euclidean and [ - + + + ] minkowski metric .",
    "four - vectors are written with upper case letters , their space and time components in lower case , so if @xmath45 is a 4-vector , then @xmath46 is its time component , @xmath47 is the spatial vector and @xmath48 its magnitude .",
    "the minkowski continued frequency is typically denoted with a different letter , usually @xmath49 . ] @xmath50 here the trace is over group and dirac indices , and the fermionic sum - integral symbol means @xmath51 we have written this in 3 + 1 dimensions , but dimensional regularization is implied . at leading order ,",
    "since the @xmath52 value is subtracted off , this is irrelevant , the result is finite and equals @xmath53 this is the usual free theory value ; @xmath54 counts the number of degrees of freedom [ the 4 counts the two spin states each for particle and anti - particle ; @xmath23 is the number of colors , @xmath55 for fundamental representation fermions in su(@xmath18 ) ] .    at nlo , there are an infinite number of diagrams , but the structure is extremely simple ; all contributions look like a gauge boson propagator with an arbitrary number of fermion loops , and counterterm insertions , inserted .",
    "no other graphs contribute at @xmath56 .",
    "this is because the only way to add a loop to a graph without changing the power of @xmath1 , is to add a fermion self - energy loop ( or the required counterterm ) to a gauge boson propagator ; any other way to add a loop introduces a @xmath7 without another factor of @xmath1 , and @xmath57 .",
    "this is the reason that large @xmath1 gauge theory is so simple ; the large @xmath1 limit is a much stronger organizing principle than large @xmath18 .",
    "this set of diagrams can of course be resummed by the standard schwinger - dyson trick .",
    "therefore the nlo contribution to the pressure is given by @xmath58^{\\mu \\nu}(q )       + \\pi^{\\mu \\nu}_{\\rm th}(q ) \\right ] \\ ; \\ ;      - \\int_{q } \\",

    "the group trace is trivial , it gives @xmath24 [ which is @xmath59 for su(@xmath18 ) and 1 for qed ] .",
    "the bosonic sum - integral symbol means @xmath60 @xmath61 is the fermionic plus counterterm contribution to the gauge boson self - energy at finite temperature , @xmath62 is the vacuum value , and @xmath63 is the free inverse propagator . our sign convention for @xmath64 is chosen so that our @xmath64 agrees with the usual minkowski , [ + - - - ] @xmath64 .",
    "the same expression for the pressure can be derived from the luttinger - ward relation @xcite , with a comparable amount of work .",
    "both vacuum and thermal self - energies are gauge invariant , since their evaluation does nt involve gauge field propagators .",
    "they are also exactly transverse , @xmath65 , and together with rotational invariance this ensures that @xmath66 can be expressed in terms of two scalar functions @xcite , @xmath67 the exact form of @xmath68 and @xmath69 are not important for our problem , all that matters to us is that they are properly normalized projection operators , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 ( which is @xmath73 , since right now we are in euclidean space ) . for the vacuum self - energy ,",
    "the transverse and longitudinal components are the same , and their value is well known ; @xmath74 here @xmath75 is the  renormalization point .",

    "if we choose a gauge where @xmath63 factorizes in the same way as @xmath64 , the lorentz trace and logarithm will commute .",
    "for instance , in feynman gauge , @xmath76^{\\mu \\nu}(q ) = \\eta^{\\mu \\nu } q^2 $ ] , and ( dropping the overall group factor ) @xmath77^{\\mu \\nu}(q )       + \\pi^{\\mu \\nu}_{\\rm th}(q ) \\right ]      = 2 \\ln ( q^2 + \\pit + \\pivac ) + \\ln(q^2 + \\pil + \\pivac )       + \\ln(q^2 ) - 2 \\ln(q^2 )      \\ , .\\ ] ] the contribution containing @xmath78 comes from @xmath68 ; the contribution containing @xmath79 comes from @xmath69 ; the positive @xmath80 contribution comes from @xmath81 , and the @xmath82 contribution comes from the ghosts , which have no self - energy at this order in @xmath1 . in a general covariant gauge the @xmath81 term would be shifted by @xmath83 with @xmath84 the gauge fixing parameter ; but this contributes equally to the vacuum and thermal contributions and so drops out . for any @xmath85 which is @xmath46 independent . the easiest way to see this is directly in the time domain , though it also follows easily on rotating to minkowski frequency .",
    "the result for @xmath86 in coulomb gauge differs by a factor of @xmath87 from the covariant result , but this also cancels between vacuum and thermal for the same reason . ] the next task is to evaluate the thermal self - energy .",
    "this has been done by weldon @xcite ( in minkowski space , but the continuation is elementary ) .",
    "his result is listed in the appendix ; unfortunately it involves an integration which to our knowledge can not be done in closed form .    because the self - energies @xmath79 , @xmath78 are only expressed as single integrals and not as closed form , analytic expressions , at this point we must either make approximations , or turn to semi - numerical methods .",
    "we want exact results ; otherwise there is no point in our looking at this theory .",
    "so the calculation will have to become more numerical .",
    "the difference between a sum - integral and an integral is an inconvenient quantity for numerical analysis , especially when issues of uv regulation have not all been addressed . at large values of @xmath88 ,",
    "the argument in the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pnlo ] ) is smooth , and the difference between a sum - integral and an integral is exponentially suppressed , by @xmath89 .",
    "so it is only the moderate @xmath90 region where we need to handle sum - integration . in this region , this can be done by re - expressing the frequency sum as a contour integration and continuing to minkowski frequency .",
    "namely , we note that the function @xmath91 has poles at @xmath92 , of residue @xmath93 . so the matsubara sum can be replaced by a contour integral , @xmath94 where the contour runs just above the real axis from @xmath95 to @xmath96 , and then just below the axis back to @xmath95 .",

    "there are no infrared problems in evaluating the above expression ; we discuss ultraviolet issues next .",
    "the thermal and vacuum contributions fail to cancel for two reasons .",
    "first , there is the factor of @xmath105 associated with the thermal contribution , which can be traced to the difference between @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "there are no ultraviolet problems associated with this piece , since at large @xmath49 it is exponentially suppressed by @xmath108 , while at large @xmath109 but moderate @xmath49 , the thermal self - energy has an exponentially small imaginary part , @xmath110 .",
    "therefore this piece is exponentially ultraviolet safe .",
    "next , there are @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "they are only power suppressed at large @xmath45 , and can potentially cause more trouble . to understand this region it is best to go back to the euclidean expression , in minkowski space ; but terms without @xmath111 can be performed either in minkowski space , or in euclidean space  integrating , not summing , on @xmath46or using some mixture , as convenient . ] and expand in small @xmath112 . in this small @xmath112 limit , the logarithms can be expanded , @xmath113 using eq .",

    "if one performs an angular average over the ( euclidean ) direction of @xmath45 , at fixed @xmath116 , then @xmath117 averages to zero , while the rest is a function of @xmath88 only ; so any regularization or cutoff procedure which respects euclidean invariance will be uv well behaved . however ,",
    "if we perform the @xmath46 integration first , at fixed @xmath109 , and then perform the @xmath118 integration , then because of the logarithm in the denominator , the result does not vanish ; instead the @xmath46 integral gives a result of order @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , performing the @xmath46 ( or minkowski @xmath49 ) integration first and the @xmath118 integration last holds out the potential for fake logarithmic divergences .    any sensible way to uv",
    "complete the theory , to deal with the landau pole , will respect euclidean invariance .",
    "therefore , however we deal with very large @xmath88 values , we should do so in a euclidean invariant way .",
    "we choose to apply a large momentum cutoff procedure ; we stop the @xmath120 integration at @xmath121 , for @xmath122 , varying the value of @xmath123 between 1/4 and 1/2 to estimate the irreducible ambiguity . applying a euclidean",
    "invariant high dimension operator cutoff works similarly .",
    "as we just indicated , it is necessary to cut off the integration at a finite value of @xmath88 , lower than @xmath124 .",
    "this also requires some extra care with our minkowski continuation ; we must compute the great arcs at complex @xmath46 which connect the minkowski and euclidean contours .",
    "our procedure is this .",
    "first , we perform the minkowski integration up to @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( the contribution linear in @xmath111 is carried to larger @xmath109 ) .",

    "great care must be taken close to the light - cone at large @xmath109 . to speed things up ,",
    "the integrals required for the self - energies are expressed in terms of a handful of integrals of one variable ( either @xmath127 $ ] or @xmath128 $ ] ) , which are tabulated and spline interpolated so only two integrations nest .",

    "the lowest order term at large @xmath88 , after angular averaging , comes from @xmath134 , so the irreducible landau pole introduced ambiguity is @xmath135 , as claimed earlier .",

    "the numerical error is less than 2 in the last place shown , and is dominated by numerical issues ; landau pole ambiguity is at most 1 in the last digit in all entries . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     what are the implications of our results for full qcd ? obviously it does not make sense to use large @xmath1 qcd directly to model the behavior of real world qcd ; after all , in the physically interesting range of temperatures , real world qcd has 3 flavors , which is definitely not @xmath156 .",
    "this was anyway not the point of studying large @xmath1 qcd .",
    "our object was to present a testing ground for other techniques .",
    "we expect these techniques to be accurate at small @xmath20 but , possibly , to break down at some larger value .",
    "what does that imply for their performance in real qcd ?",
    "as we have tried to emphasize , success at large @xmath1 probably does not ensure success in full qcd ; but failure at large @xmath1 almost certainly means the technique is not valid .",
    "but it would also be nice to have a rough way of equating a value of @xmath20 to a comparable value of the qcd coupling @xmath157 , so if a technique works at weak coupling but later breaks down , we can estimate its range of validity in full qcd .",
    "probably the most reasonable way to equate @xmath20 with @xmath157 is to compare values of the debye mass .",
    "at least , this makes sense in the picture where screening is the dominant physical process changing the pressure .",
    "the debye mass for each theory , at leading order , is , the large @xmath1 expression would be correct through order @xmath158 . ]",
    "@xmath159 equating these , for 3 flavor qcd , gives @xmath160 .",
    "so @xmath161 ( relevant for temperatures of order 100gev ) is comparable to @xmath162 , whereas @xmath163 ( relevant closer to the qcd phase transition temperature ) is comparable to @xmath164 .    in conclusion , we have presented exact results at next - to - leading order ( first nontrivial order ) for the pressure of large @xmath1 qcd .",
    "these results should be useful for testing the reliability of resummed perturbative techniques , used for full qcd .",
