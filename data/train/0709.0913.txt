    "single - impurity anderson model ( siam ) has attracted much interest of theoretical physicists from its introduction in the early sixties of last century as a simple model for formation of local magnetic moments.@xcite one of the reasons for the interest in siam has been its connection with the @xmath0 exchange model and the kondo effect @xcite demonstrating a nontrivial strong - coupling behavior .",
    "the model won on importance after finding an exact solution with an algebraic bethe ansatz.@xcite revival of interests in reliable methods suitable for solving impurity models was brought with the concept of the dynamical mean - field theory of correlated lattice electrons.@xcite in particular , methods addressing dynamical properties of impurity models have been demanded in the mean - field description of strongly correlated systems .",
    "since the exact algebraic approaches cover only static properties , a number of approximate analytic and numerical approaches have been revisited in the effort to provide an accurate impurity solver for strong electron correlations .",
    "the direct way to treat the dynamics of siam is to use the perturbation theory in the interaction strength .",
    "it is known that such a perturbation series converges for all interaction strengths and already second order gives rather accurate results.@xcite unrenormalized weak - coupling expansions break down in critical regions of any phase transition signaled by a singularity in a two - particle correlation function .",
    "hence , extension of perturbative expansions to the strong - coupling regime of translationally invariant lattice models is questionable . on the other hand , strong - coupling expansions based on the infinite - interaction model @xcite",
    "fail to reproduce the fermi liquid regime in the weak - coupling limit . a dynamical theory reliably describing the transition from the weak - coupling fermi liquid to a strong - coupling solution is still missing .",
    "presently , the most comprehensive quantitative approaches producing dynamical properties of the impurity models are quantum monte carlo ( qmc)@xcite and the numerical renormalization group ( nrg).@xcite the latter scheme was first devised by wilson when solving the @xmath0 exchange model and later extended to siam in ref .  .",
    "although designed for static thermodynamic properties , nrg can be used to some extent for the calculation of dynamical quantities as well.@xcite since the quantum monte carlo is restricted to rather high temperatures , nrg represents now - a - days the most accurate quantitative low - temperature and low - energy solution of impurity problems for intermediate couplings.@xcite    unbiased numerical schemes such as nrg and qmc are reliable only for nonsingular quantities .",
    "a critical behavior can be deduced in these schemes only from extrapolations .",
    "when no simple scaling law holds we can not make definite conclusions on the existence and character of the critical behavior in the strong - coupling regime of correlated electrons only from numerical data .",
    "an analytic theory is needed for this purpose .",
    "we recently developed an analytic approximate scheme summing selected classes of feynman diagrams for the two - particle vertex.@xcite the approximation is justified in the critical region of the bethe - salpeter equation in the electron - hole scattering channel and uses a simplified version of the parquet equations for the electron - hole and electron - electron irreducible vertex functions .",
    "we demonstrated that in the symmetric case of siam , the low - energy kondo scale is qualitatively correctly reproduced ( universal features thereof ) in this approximation.@xcite    in this paper we discuss the strong - coupling kondo behavior in siam in a more general context beyond the symmetric case .",
    "for this purpose we use simplified parquet parquet equations .",
    "we introduce a general method of simplification of the parquet equations for impurity models .",
    "it is based on a partial separation of short- and long - range energy scales induced by a singularity in one of the bethe - salpeter equations for the two - particle vertex . in the critical region of a singularity in the vertex function",
    "we replace regular functions ( no critical long - range fluctuations ) by constants and keep dynamical only the singular ones with critical fluctuations . in this way",
    "we do not affect the universal features of the critical behavior .",
    "unlike the classical criticality we are , however , unable to uniquely separate short- and long - range fluctuations in the strong - coupling limit of correlated electrons .",
    "the universal and non - universal properties are mixed up there .",
    "we hence have to decouple the short- and long - range fluctuations with an additive approximation to make the ansatz of separation of scales consistent",
    ". we can do it in several ways . here",
    "we discuss two of them . in the first one , introduced in ref .  , we demand fulfilling of the parquet equations for regular vertices averaged over short - range fluctuations to obtain constants .",
    "this is a mean - field - type approximation that can be applied in the whole region of the input parameters also beyond the critical region of the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "it is a fully consistent approximation in the fermi - liquid regime .",
    "another , more accurate way of decoupling short- and long - range fluctuations introduced in this paper is to use systematically the dominant small energy scale shaping the singularity in the vertex function to reduce the frequency dependence of regular functions .",
    "the latter approach is more precise as concerns the critical behavior but less flexible as concerns applicability outside the critical region .",
    "studying the kondo behavior in siam we distinguish its two different aspects .",
    "first , we introduce a small dimensionless scale connected with a singularity in the two - particle vertex that we call the kondo scale . from this scale",
    "we derive the kondo temperature as a cutoff screening the actual singularity that can not be reached in impurity models .",
    "next we analyze the behavior of one - electron functions in the kondo limit , i.  e. , with a quasi - divergent two - particle vertex .",
    "we demonstrate the existence of a narrow kondo resonance peak near the fermi energy for small deviations from the symmetric situation .",
    "we calculate the position of the kondo peak and estimate its width .",
    "we also discuss the existence of the satellite hubbard bands in the strong - coupling limit .",
    "it is more elaborate to study asymmetric situations in impurity models than the symmetric case .",
    "we must introduce an effective chemical potential controlling the occupation of the impurity level . to guarantee consistency of approximations ,",
    "the chemical potential must be determined self - consistently from the actual filling of the impurity level .",
    "it means that independently of the form of one - electron propagators we use in the approximate treatment we have to calculate impurity filling from the full spectral function with the self - energy obtained in the parquet approximation .",
    "we hence must achieve a static one - particle self - consistency . only in this way we avoid spurious ( hartree - type ) transitions in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : parquets ] we introduce the parquet equations for impurity models .",
    "the simplifications of the parquet equations in the critical region of a singularity in the bethe - salpeter equations are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : simplified ] .",
    "two - particle functions in the kondo regime are calculated in sec .",
    "[ sec : kondo - scale ] and the one - particle functions in sec .",
    "[ sec : self - energy ] .",
    "we start our investigation with the hamiltonian of siam that reads @xmath1 we denoted @xmath2 . when calculating the grand potential and thermodynamic properties of the impurity site we can explicitly integrate over the degrees of freedom of the delocalized electrons . to this purpose we standardly replace the local part of the propagator of the conduction electrons by a constant @xmath3 the value of which we set as the energy unit . with this simplification",
    "we expand all dynamical and thermodynamic quantities in powers of the interaction strength @xmath4 and rearrange appropriately the resulting series .",
    "the principal idea of the parquet approach is to derive the self - energy and other thermodynamic and spectral properties via a two - particle vertex @xmath5 .",
    "this vertex is standardly represented via bethe - salpeter equations .",
    "the bethe - salpeter equations express the full two - particle vertex by means of irreducible ones that can be generically represented as@xcite    [ eq : bs - parquet ] @xmath6_\\alpha \\star \\gamma\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the irreducible vertex in channel @xmath8 , the brackets @xmath9_\\alpha$ ] stand for an appropriate interconnection of internal variables in the chosen scattering channel @xmath8 and @xmath10 represents summation over intermediate states created during the scattering process .",
    "we use in our consideration only singlet electron - hole and electron - electron scattering channels .",
    "the consistency of approaches with more two - particle vertices is guaranteed by the parquet equation that reads @xmath11    we introduced a vertex @xmath12 irreducible in both channels that in the parquet approximation is replaced by the bare interaction @xmath4 .",
    "the parquet equation   says that the full two - particle vertex is a sum of the irreducible vertices from the electron - hole channel ( @xmath13 ) and from the electron - electron channel ( @xmath14 ) from which the completely irreducible vertex ( bare interaction ) is subtracted .",
    "equation is used in each bethe - salpeter equation   to exclude the full vertex @xmath5 and to close the approximation for the irreducible vertices @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in the impurity case",
    "the dynamical variables in the vertex functions are matsubara frequencies .",
    "hence the explicit form of the parquet equations with the electron - hole and electron - electron singlet channels read    [ eq : bs ] @xmath15\\ .",
    "\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and @xmath16 .",
    "\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    these equations form a set of coupled nonlinear integral equations that can not be solved by available analytic means . their numerical solution with @xmath17 is available only for high temperatures@xcite in the region irrelevant for quantum effects induced by strong electron correlations . since we do not know the exact form of the completely irreducible vertex @xmath12 we have to resort in the parquet approach to approximations anyway",
    "for most of physically interesting situations it is not necessary to know the detailed form of the completely irreducible vertex @xmath12 .",
    "if it is a regular function it is reasonable to replace it with the bare interaction , which is standardly done in the parquet approximation .",
    "it is then futile to try to solve the parquet equations with a tremendous effort in regions where no significant deviations from fermi liquid or gas are present .",
    "the principal area of application of the parquet approach should be in the low - temperature strong - coupling region where the standard weak - coupling schemes fail .",
    "the critical region of a singularity in one of the bethe - salpeter equations is the situation where the difference between the parquet theory and other weak - coupling schemes becomes significant .",
    "parquet equations due to their nonlinear character introduce a two - particle self - consistency enabling to handle properly the critical behavior .",
    "in particular , the two - particle self - consistency effectively suppresses spurious non - physical singularities of one - particle approximations .",
    "that is why we try to solve the parquet equations , at least in an approximate way , in the critical region of a singularity in bethe - salpeter equations .",
    "fortunately , singularities with divergent vertex functions offer a natural way of a simplification of the parquet equations .",
    "this simplification is a separation of long - range fluctuations of divergent quantities from the short - range ones of regular functions . in the critical region of a singular vertex",
    "we then treat finite differences in regular functions as negligible with respect to macroscopic changes shaping the singular behavior .    to make the simplification of the parquet equations effective we must rearrange the weak - coupling expansion in such a way that we first reach the critical region of a singularity in bethe - salpeter equations . in siam it is achieved in the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , that is , the bethe - salpeter equation in the electron - hole channel with the bare interaction and the hartree one - electron propagators .",
    "the two - particle vertex in matsubara frequencies then reads @xmath18 where we denoted @xmath19 the dynamical electron - hole bubble .",
    "it is easy to evaluate the electron - hole bubble with the hartree propagators @xmath20 to be @xmath21 \\frac \\delta { [ ( x -      \\overline{\\mu})^2 + \\delta^2]^2}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is an effective chemical potential measuring deviations from the symmetric case @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the fermi function .",
    "we used @xmath25 , the actual occupation per spin of the impurity level . since the static value @xmath26",
    ", we choose a finite interaction strength @xmath4 and a very low ( zero ) temperature @xmath27 so that we are very close to the singularity in vertex @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "we now rearrange the expansion beyond rpa in such way that we remain all the time in the critical region of this singularity .",
    "we then replace the interaction strength @xmath4 as an expansion parameter by a new small scale @xmath30 .",
    "we keep this scale fixed during summation of diagrams and use it to separate large ( relevant ) from small ( irrelevant ) quantities .",
    "we will discuss ways how we can use the existence of a small ( large ) scale to simplify the parquet equations .",
    "in fact we will see that it is not the scale @xmath31 itself but rather @xmath32 that is taken as a small parameter in the expansion beyond rpa in the critical region of the electron - hole vertex . by the parquet equations we effectively replace the direct summation of diagrams beyond rpa and their renormalization in the critical region of the singularity in the bethe - salpeter equation from the electron - hole channel . in analogy with classical criticality",
    ", rpa corresponds to a static mean - field approximation and the parquet approach to renormalization - group dynamical corrections to the mean - field critical behavior .      by solving the parquet equations in the critical region of a bethe - salpeter equation we assume that no other critical point emerges beyond that found in the one - channel ( mean - field ) approximation .",
    "the singularity in siam emerges in the electron - hole scattering channel and hence the irreducible vertex from the electron - electron channel @xmath33 is singular in the variable @xmath34 .",
    "as no other critical scattering appears in the model , the irreducible vertex from the electron - hole channel @xmath35 remains regular .",
    "we now neglect all finite differences in regular functions and replace @xmath13 with a constant , an effective interaction @xmath36 . inserting this ansatz in eq .",

    "this simple form enables us to control analytically the critical behavior of the singular vertex @xmath14 .",

    "we must do the same on the right - hand side as well .",
    "it contains , however , singular functions .",
    "we hence can not demand equality of both sides for a specifically chosen matsubara frequency . to make our simplifying ansatz consistent we have to first regularize the right - hand side of eq .   and grant equality only in a mean . to achieve consistency",
    "we multiply both sides with @xmath40 and @xmath41 and sum over fermionic matsubara frequencies @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we further put @xmath44 to keep the effective interaction real .",
    "since the low - frequency contributions are the most relevant ones , we obtain @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the static electron - electron bubble .",
    "further on we used a notation    [ eq : convolutions - def ] @xmath47 @xmath48    equations   and  - form a closed set of relations determining the static effective interaction @xmath36 and the dynamical vertex @xmath49 as functionals of the one - particle propagators @xmath50 and the bare interaction @xmath4 .",
    "they were derived and justified in the critical region of a singularity in the bethe - salpeter equation from the electron - hole channel .",

    "the form of the defining equations for @xmath49 and @xmath36 enables their application in the whole region of the input parameters .",
    "the approximation remains consistent everywhere in the fermi - liquid regime .",
    "separation of large scales ( potentially divergent functions ) and small scales ( regular functions ) is incomplete in siam . to stay close to the critical point of the singularity in @xmath51 we need to know the value of the effective interaction @xmath36 .",
    "we do not need to know , however , the detailed frequency dependence of vertex @xmath13 but only its action in bethe - salpeter equation  . with an effective static interaction",
    "we make a replacement @xmath52 in the exact parquet equation .",
    "this replacement is qualitatively correct if we treat integrals ( sums over matsubara frequencies ) of singular functions as regular ones and as far as the effective interaction @xmath36 remains finite .",
    "we will see that in siam it is always the case even in the limit @xmath53 .",
    "although the critical behavior of the singular vertex @xmath51 does not depend on the value of the effective interaction @xmath36 , we need its value to determine the asymptotic behavior when the critical point is approached .",

    "the averaging of eq .",
    "we used in the preceding subsection to reach consistency in the determination of the effective interaction is only one , mean - field way .",
    "we can proceed in a more accurate way if we fully utilize the dominance of the low - frequency asymptotics of the singular vertex .",
    "we can approximate the singular vertex in the critical region with @xmath56 as @xmath57 where we denoted @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",

    "such a static replacement can not be done , however , in singular functions . before we can set redundant frequencies to zero in eq .",
    "we multiply both sides either by @xmath40 or by @xmath41 and integrate over @xmath42 or @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the output is a `` sufficiently '' regular function with maximally logarithmically divergent terms proportional to @xmath63 where we already can put all external frequencies to zero .",
    "we then obtain another equation for the effective interaction @xmath64 where we denoted @xmath65 .",
    "this approximation is applicable only at zero temperature with the sums over matsubara frequencies replaced by integrals . in this approximation , however , the singularity in the two - particle vertex is treated more accurately , since unlike the preceding construction we treated here logarithmically divergent scales of order @xmath63 more sensitively .",
    "logarithmic terms may go lost or be washed out by additional summation over fermionic matsubara frequencies used in the preceding subsection .",

    "this result deviates from the atomic limit levels @xmath150 , but we must realize that the hubbard satellite peaks in the kondo regime are not related to the atomic limit , since the latter is not ( can not be ) part of the solution with a singular two - particle vertex .",

    "we succeeded in simplifying the parquet equations to a manageable form without loosing consistency and fundamental characteristics of the fermi - liquid regime for arbitrary fillings of the impurity level .",
    "we showed that the derived simplified parquet equations for two - particle irreducible vertices in the electron - hole ( @xmath13 ) and electron - electron ( @xmath14 ) singlet channels result from a resummation of the diagrammatic perturbation expansion in the critical region of a singularity in the two - particle vertex .",
    "such a singularity emerges in siam due to multiple electron - hole scatterings .",
    "the resummation of the perturbation expansion proceeds so that the critical region is reached first within rpa .",
    "diagrammatic contributions beyond rpa are then summed not to be driven out of the critical region of the two - particle vertex .",
    "singularity in the two - particle vertex is controlled by a vanishing scale .",
    "this new scale replaces the interaction strength in the perturbation expansion beyond rpa and is used to select relevant contributions in the critical regime .    the principal assumption for rearranging the diagrammatic expansion in a two - particle criticality is to explicitly sum and control two - particle contributions .",
    "we distinguish two basic classes of two - particle functions : singular and regular .",
    "the former diverge with vanishing of the critical scale and the latter remain finite .",
    "logarithmically divergent functions ( integrals over the singular functions ) are treated as ( marginally ) regular ones .",
    "the critical scale enables us to neglect finite differences in the regular two - particle functions and replace them with constants .",
    "only the potentially divergent functions are kept dynamical in the two - particle criticality .",
    "even more , only the singular low - frequency asymptotics matters in the critical region .",
    "it is clear that contributions beyond rpa must be summed in a self - consistent way to make the perturbation theory of siam singularity - free for any finite interaction strength .",
    "the parquet equations provide us with the necessary two - particle self - consistency .",
    "we presented two ways how to simplify the parquet equations in the critical region of the singularity in the electron - hole channel .",
    "they differ in the way we suppress the frequency dependence of regular functions .",
    "this ambiguity , however , influences only non - universal critical properties . in the first construction we replaced the regular vertices with their specific averaged values . in the second one we used the fact that only frequencies of order of the vanishing critical scale remain important . in both cases we reached a set of manageable equations determining an effective interaction , replacing the bare one in rpa , and the singular two - particle vertex .",
    "the solution of the simplified parquet equations led to the kondo behavior in the strong - coupling regime for all fillings of the impurity level .",
    "we found that the vanishing critical scale of the two - particle vertex is the one determining the kondo temperature at which the two - particle vertex saturates and the kondo temperature overtakes the control of the low - temperature behavior of two - particle vertex and correlation functions .",
    "we thus find that the kondo behavior is just a critical behavior due to a singularity in the two - particle vertex induced by frequency fluctuations .",
    "the critical point in siam is reached only by infinite bare interaction , but the critical region extends deep into the physical domain of its finite values . unlike the existing ( approximate ) solutions of siam we clearly demonstrated the two - particle origin of the kondo behavior .",
    "in fact , it is not the density of states on the fermi surface @xmath153 that controls the kondo behavior but rather the electron - hole bubble @xmath154 .",
    "it is fortunate that for the lorentzian dos used here and in the bethe ansatz the two numbers coincide .",
    "finally we investigated one - electron functions in the kondo regime .",
    "we related the two - particle kondo scale with the width of the quasiparticle peak near the fermi energy and found a good qualitative agreement with the exact result .",
    "we were able to estimate analytically the width of this peak and showed that it is well formed only close to the half - filled case .",
    "farther away from the symmetric situation the kondo resonance dissolves in the bulk of other states .",
    "we also showed that our parquet approximation not only reproduces correctly the kondo resonance in the spectral function but it is also able to produce the satellite hubbard bands .",
    "we found a criterion for their existence and an estimate for the positions of their centers .",
    "to summarize , we presented a simple analytic approximation producing dynamical properties of siam for all interaction strengths and impurity fillings .",
    "it correctly reproduces universal features of the low - temperature kondo behavior and predicts a kondo resonance peak near the fermi energy in the strong - coupling regime for small deviations from the electron - hole symmetric case . at intermediate couplings it is in a good quantitative agreement with more laborious numerical renormalization - group calculations .",
    "we identified the kondo behavior as the critical behavior near a singularity in the electron - hole bethe - salpeter equation with balanced electron - hole and electron - electron multiple scatterings .",
    "the electron - hole scatterings are needed to reach a singularity in bethe - salpeter equations and the electron - electron ones to screen the inter - particle interaction . due to its universality",
    ", the approximation can easily be extended to more complex multi - orbital or translationally invariant lattice models for a reliable qualitative and quantitative investigation of a transition from weak to strong - coupling regimes in materials with tangible electron correlations .",
