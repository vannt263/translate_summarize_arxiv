    "the description of macroscopic states has been achieved succesfully in the case of systems which are in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "indeed , for these , gibbs approach via the canonical or other ensembles , describes in a well - defined manner most equilibrium systems ( under appropriate ergodicity assumptions ) , and is also well - supported by experiment . on the other hand , the goal of similarly describing appropriate macroscopic states for systems out of equilibrium has , so far , not been achieved in general , and the attempts to do so have met with serious difficulties .    an interesting intermediate case is found for so - called metastable systems .",
    "these arise typically near first order phase transitions , when a phase , which is not the thermodynamically most stable one for the values of the parameters considered , is nevertheless observed to persist over very long times .",
    "a typical instance occurs , for example , when a system is rapidly quenched from a region in which a given phase is stable to another region in which the phase is unstable .",
    "traditionally ( see , for example , maxwell @xcite ) , such states have been considered in a purely thermodynamic framework .",
    "analytic forms of the free energy , which involved non - convexities , were taken to reflect physical reality , and the states showing local thermodynamic stability ( for example , those which have positive susceptibility or compressibility ) were identified with metastable states as observed in nature .",
    "this straightforward explanation , however , suffered a serious blow when it was understood that short - range systems must necessarily have convex free energies , as was shown , for example , in @xcite .",
    "the presence of non - convex parts in the free energy of a van der waals system is hence necessarily linked to the fact that the van der waals model is exact only in the limit of long - range potentials .    nevertheless , a great deal of work followed along these lines .",
    "in particular , langer @xcite showed how the original program of maxwell and van der waals could be carried out under quite reasonable assumptions on the nature of the singularities present near the coexistence curve of two phases .",
    "the metastable phase was there assumed to be destabilized by the possible  but very unlikely  presence of large droplets of the stable phase . that droplets of the stable phase are unlikely to arise was explained by the fact that they must appear previously as smaller droplets , which are themselves highly unlikely , since they are strongly suppressed by the effect of surface tension . in such models , the free energy and the partition function",
    "are obtained from the corresponding equilibrium quantities by a highly non - trivial analytic continuation around an essential singularity .",
    "the reason why the physical metastable free energy should be identified with the result of such an analytical continuation , however , is not entirely clear in this approach . indeed",
    ", this could hardly be otherwise , since the basic objects with which this framework operates are drawn from equilibrium statistical mechanics , whereas the metastable state , being subject to decay to a state very different from itself , is intrinsically a non - equilibrium object , albeit perhaps a particularly simple one .",
    "in a different line of attack , penrose and lebowitz @xcite studied metastability directly from a dynamical point of view .",
    "their considerations were limited to rather particular models , but the principles involved seem capable of great generalization .",
    "the crucial idea was the introduction of a _ restricted ensemble _ , defined in such a way as to prevent nucleation from ever taking place .",
    "if such a dynamics could indeed be defined in such a way as to have the characteristics of a typical equilibrium process , then the thermodynamic approach would be , in a sense , vindicated .    in more recent work , gaveau and schulman @xcite",
    "have succeeded in making this quite precise in the very general framework of arbitrary markov processes .",
    "their approach consists in assuming that some non - equilibrium eigenstate of the linear operator arising in the master equation describing the dynamics has an anomalously small eigenvalue with respect to all others . in systems",
    "for which the thermodynamic limit has not yet been taken , arguments taken from the classical theory of nucleation will often strongly suggest the existence of such slowly decaying states . as to the thermodynamic limit , it has been forcefully argued in @xcite that it may in fact be quite misleading when applied to metastable systems . in their work , they essentially show the following :    1 .   under their assumptions ,",
    "the space of configurations separates into two disjoint subsets , which are both almost invariant under the dynamics , one of which can be identified as the metastable region . in particular ,",
    "if the system is started in this region and allowed to evolve until it attempts to leave it , after which it is killed , then the evolution of the system is similar to that in which the system evolves in the usual manner .",
    "2 .   similarly",
    ", they show that the average time to escape from the metastable region is very large .    in this work",
    "we develop a rather simple formalism , along lines similar to those of gaveau and schulman , that sharpens and extends their results in various ways ; our development was outlined in @xcite .",
    "we confine ourselves to ergodic and acyclic processes satisfying detailed balance , for which the stationary distribution can unambiguously be identified with the equilibirum distribution in the appropriate ensemble of statistical mechanics . for such systems , a restricted dynamics",
    "in which the process is reflected , instead of killed , each time it attempts to leave the metastable region is shown to also be close to the original process .",
    "( this kind of restriction was also used in a slightly more specific context in @xcite . )",
    "this restricted process reaches an equilibrium state described by a distribution which is proportional to the equilibrium distribution of the original unrestricted process .",
    "we also show that under suitable conditions , any initial condition decays quickly into either a metastable state , in which case the system is described by the equilibrium distribution of the restricted process , or to equilibrium .    in this respect ,",
    "another important point in which we sharpen the results of gaveau and schulman is the following : they prove that _ on average _ it takes a long time for a system to decay from the metastable phase to equilibrium .",
    "this , however , is not enough to account for the expected behavior of metastable systems : for example , if a system were to decay in a time of order one with probability @xmath0 and in a time of order @xmath1 with probability @xmath2 , then the average decay time would be of order @xmath3 , and hence would diverge as @xmath4 , yet no one would call such a system metastable . indeed , in agreement with @xcite , one expects metastable states to reach a ( quasi-)stationary regime quickly and then , in a relatively abrupt maner , decay to equilibrium .",
    "the broadness of the distribution of the time intervals during which the state remains in the metastable ( quasi-)stationary state is what gives rise to the slow decay of the distribution describing such a state . here",
    "we show that , under the assumptions required to define metastability , it is in fact true that the _ probability _ of decay in a short time is very small , in accordance with the intuitive picture given above .",
    "these result support the idea behind the restricted process approach .",
    "furthermore , since we are really dealing with partition functions of two systems , both of which are equilibrium systems , the logarithm of the proportionality constant is related to the difference in free energy between the unrestricted and restricted systems , corresponding to the stable and the metastable phases respectively .",
    "another interesting consequence of these observations is the following : since a metastable system can , to a good approximation , be described by an equilibrium process over certain time scales and the usual connections between time correlations and response to small external perturbations ( fluctuation  dissipation theorem ) hold exactly in the restricted dynamics , then , again to a good approximation , they will also hold in the metastable state .",
    "it is therefore legitimate , say , to measure the frequency dependent susceptibility in a metastable state by computing the fourier transform of the magnetization autocorrelation function @xcite .    to illustrate some of the results described above",
    ", we study a two - dimensional ising model subject to an external field .",
    "we parametrize the phase space by reduced variables ( in this case magnetization and total spin  spin interaction energy , which are adequate for the system sizes we are considering ) and evaluate the equilibrium distribution over the complete parameter space using the wang  landau algorithm . within the metastable region ,",
    "we compare the equilibrium distribution to the metastable distribution obtained from monte carlo simulations of the kinetic ising system . in the metastable region within the space of reduced variables , we show that the metastable distribution is indeed proportional to the equilibrium distribution , with the proportionality constant being as derived in the theory .",
    "finally , we extend the formalism to the case in which the system has several metastable states .",
    "this gives rise to minor complications due to the possibility that the system may decay to equilibrium by passing through other metastable states .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ] , we review the formalism , which is similar to that used by gaveau and schulman , and the assumptions and notation to be used throughout the paper . in section  [ sec:3 ] , we present and derive the results described above in the case where the system has a single metastable state . in section  [ sec:4 ] ,",
    "we show how our ideas can be applied to the ising model , at least for sufficiently small systems .",
    "the results shown in the previous sections can be confirmed using this test model . in section",
    "[ sec:5 ] , we discuss the complications appearing when a finite number of metastable states are taken into account , instead of only one .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec:6 ] , we present some conclusions and outlook .",
    "we set up the description of slowly decaying as well as metastable states within the general framework of markov process , which can then be applied to a large variety of systems .",
    "finite _ set @xmath5 of elements @xmath6 , we consider a continuous time markov chain on this set defined by transition rates @xmath7 .",
    "the probability @xmath8 to encounter the system at time @xmath9 in the configuration @xmath6 then obeys the master equation @xmath10 . \\label{eq:2.1}\\ ] ] if this markov process satisfies the conditions of ergodicity and aperiodicity , see @xcite , which are usually satisfied in the systems we are interested in , then the probability distribution @xmath11 approaches a unique equilibrium distribution @xmath12 as @xmath13 .",
    "we will further assume that the system obeys detailed balance .",
    "that is , @xmath14 holds for all @xmath6 .",
    "we rewrite ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) in the operator form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a vector with index @xmath6 , and @xmath17 is a linear operator on the space of all such vectors .",
    "a scalar product of two vectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be defined as @xmath20 under which , given the detailed balance condition ( [ eq:2.2 ] ) , the operator @xmath17 is self - adjoint : @xmath21    since the underlying vector space is finite - dimensional , there is a complete orthonormal set of @xmath22 eigenvectors @xmath23 satisfying @xmath24 where the @xmath25 are by definition arranged in increasing order , and @xmath22 is the number of elements of @xmath5 , i.e.  the number of possible configurations .",
    "the existence of an equilibrium distribution implies that @xmath26 and the corresponding @xmath27 is in fact the equilibrium distribution .",
    "all other @xmath25 are strictly positive .    using the orthonormality of the @xmath23 we can write @xmath28 implying that @xmath12 is normalized and that adding to it arbitrary multiples of @xmath29 , when @xmath30 , does not alter this normalization .",
    "the completeness of the eigenvectors ( [ eq:2.6 ] ) implies that @xmath31 this leads to an exact expression for the probability of arriving from @xmath32 to @xmath6 in time @xmath9 : @xmath33 in the following , we shall say that a system is slowly decaying if at least one of its eigenvalues @xmath34 is much less than all the others . at first",
    ", we shall limit ourselves to the case in which there is only one slow eigenvalue , that is , when @xmath35 for all @xmath36 .    now consider a process evolving from the initial condition @xmath32 .",
    "then , from ( [ eq:2.9 ] ) , in the relevant time range @xmath37 , one finds that the configuration @xmath6 is occupied with the following ( time - independent ) probability @xmath38 note that , due to ( [ eq:2.7 ] ) , this is normalized .",
    "also , since it differs exponentially little from the exact result , we may conclude that it is positive , except perhaps in some places where it assumes exponentially small negative values .",
    "this situation can be corrected by setting the negative values to zero and recomputing the normalization , which leads to negligible alterations .",
    "this result focuses our attention on the value @xmath39 , which characterizes the nature of the initial condition .",
    "this quantity will be central to all that follows .",
    "in particular it will allow us to determine when the initial condition can be called metastable and the resulting probability distribution given by ( [ eq:2.10 ] ) can justifiably be identified with that of a metastable state .",
    "in what follows , we denote @xmath40 by @xmath41 , and the maximum value of @xmath41 over all @xmath42 by @xmath43 .",
    "next we define the sets @xmath44 and @xmath45 as follows : @xmath46 and @xmath45 is defined as the complement of @xmath44 in @xmath5 .",
    "we show in section  [ sec:3 ] that the choice of the factor @xmath47 to define the lower bound on @xmath41 in ( [ eq:2.103 ] ) is relatively arbitrary",
    ".    equation ( [ eq:2.103 ] ) defines a partition of phase space into two disjoint sets . in the following",
    "we shall address the question of the extent to which we can use this partition to define a metastable state , and in particular , to understand when a standard thermodynamic approach to the study of such systems is legitimate .",
    "to this end we single out among the slowly decaying systems those characterized by the condition that the probability of being found within @xmath44 in equilibrium is negligibly small , i.e.  such that @xmath48 we will call metastable systems the slowly decaying systems satisfying this condition . in particular , from normalization , metastable states satisfy : @xmath49 we now turn to proving various properties both for slowly decaying systems not satisfying condition ( [ eq:2.11 ] ) , and for metastable systems , with a view to justifying the usual assumptions concerning the description of the latter .",
    "we begin by considering a slowly decaying system with a single slow mode , so that its phase space is partitioned into @xmath45 and @xmath44 as before .",
    "we first consider the case in which the initial condition @xmath32 satisfies @xmath50 in this case , we define @xmath51 as the quasi - stationary distribution which arises from this initial condition over the time range @xmath52 , given by ( see ( [ eq:2.10 ] ) ) @xmath53      let us define the random variable @xmath54 as the time at which a path starting at @xmath32 satisfying ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) reaches @xmath45 for the first time .",
    "a key result is that with high probability this time is large .",
    "indeed , for these processes , we have @xmath55 here @xmath56 denotes the probability of an event ; for example , the lhs of ( [ eq : a.8 ] ) denotes the probability of @xmath54 being less than @xmath9 .    to prove this , we proceed as follows .",
    "we denote by @xmath57 the path followed by the process starting at @xmath58 of the markov process defined by ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) , and by @xmath59 the expectation value .",
    "the set @xmath44 is defined by a condition on the function @xmath41 , so to study the first exit time @xmath54 from this set , we must consider the evolution of @xmath60 $ ] as a function of time .",

    "this result is of considerable interest .",
    "it represents a significant sharpening of a result due to gaveau and schulman @xcite , stating that the _ average value _",
    "@xmath71 is large .",
    "here we show that , for appropriate initial conditions , the system is very unlikely to leave @xmath44 before time @xmath9 in the relevant time range @xmath72 . from this result",
    "one may also derive the following estimate on @xmath73 and @xmath74 , which will be of use later : @xmath75 \\leq{\\mathbb{p}}(t\\leq t ) \\ll1 .",
    "\\label{eq : a.33}\\ ] ] the inequality follows from the fact that @xmath76 is equal to the total probability of finding a system started at an initial condition @xmath32 with @xmath77 in @xmath45 at time @xmath9 .",
    "but this is less than @xmath78 , so that the estimate ( [ eq : a.33 ] ) follows .",
    "if we think of @xmath51 as describing a metastable state , then ( [ eq : a.33 ] ) states the ( perhaps unsurprising ) fact that the metastable state is entirely concentrated outside @xmath45 .",
    "note that the converse , namely that @xmath79 has only negligible weight in @xmath44 can not be shown in a similar way .",
    "rather , this condition is what we introduce in equation ( [ eq:2.11 ] ) as an _ additional hypothesis _ to single out true metastable states from slowly decaying systems .",
    "we now introduce a restricted markov process in order to be able to treat the slowly decaying system as if it were in fact in equilibrium . to this end , define the following restricted transition rates : @xmath80 it is clear that the rates @xmath81 only allow for connections within @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , the @xmath82 process can be intuitively understood as a process that imposes reflecting boundary conditions at the border separating @xmath44 from @xmath45 .. ] since @xmath12 satisfies detailed balance in the original process , it is still the equilibrium distribution for this restricted process , with respect to which it also satisfies detailed balance .",
    "but the restricted system is no longer ergodic , and therefore @xmath12 is not the unique stationary distribution .",
    "indeed , @xmath83 defined by @xmath84 is stationary for any constants @xmath85 and @xmath86 . in particular",
    ", we may choose these constants so that @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "this implies that @xmath89    of course , it is now very tempting to identify @xmath90 with @xmath91 . in order to do this ,",
    "we need to show that the process defined by ( [ eq : a.21 ] ) , which we denote by @xmath82 ( for restricted ) , remains close to the original markov process defined by the rate @xmath92 , which we denote by @xmath16 ( for physical ) .",
    "this can indeed be shown for a slowly decaying system , if the initial condition @xmath32 satisfies @xmath77 and @xmath9 is in the relevant time range @xmath93 .",
    "we define closeness as follows : for any subset @xmath94 , define @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are paths of the @xmath16 and @xmath82 processes , respectively .",
    "we will say that the two processes are _ close in variation _ if @xmath98 is small for any @xmath94 .    for the proof ,",
    "we make the following observation , inspired by the coupling techniques of probability theory .",
    "we define a compound process @xmath99 on the product space @xmath100 as follows : @xmath101 moves according to the @xmath16 process , that is , via the rates @xmath102 , and @xmath103 follows @xmath101 around as long as the latter remains in @xmath44 .",
    "as soon as @xmath101 leaves @xmath44 , however , each process evolves independently according to their respective rates . by construction",
    ", the projections of the compound process @xmath104 on either subspace yield the processes @xmath82 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the two paths @xmath97 and @xmath96 can thus be viewed as projections of the process @xmath104 .",
    "we wish to show that @xmath105 is small in the relevant time range .",
    "this is achieved as follows : again let us introduce the random time @xmath54 as the first time at which @xmath96 , starting from @xmath68 for which @xmath106 , leaves @xmath44 .",
    "it then follows by the construction of the process @xmath104 that @xmath107 which is indeed small for @xmath108 according to ( [ eq : a.8 ] ) . as this holds for any @xmath109 ,",
    "the probability distribution for the restricted process is close in variation to that of the physical process .",
    "this implies that within the relevant time range , if @xmath110 , then @xmath111 where @xmath112 denote the transition probabilities from @xmath68 to @xmath6 in a time @xmath9 for the physical and the restricted process respectively . again",
    "choosing @xmath68 such that @xmath106 and expressing each of these distributions in terms of the eigenfunctions of their respective evolution operators , we have : @xmath113 and @xmath114 then , the relation expressed in ( [ eq : a.231 ] ) implies that @xmath115 , if these quantities are not negligible in @xmath44 , in which case we also have @xmath116 . thus , again in the time range @xmath37 , we are left with @xmath117 which , together with the fact that @xmath118 , leads to @xmath119 we have therefore two results of interest : on the one hand , the first passage time from a state @xmath32 satisfying @xmath77 to @xmath45 is very unlikely to be short . on the other ,",
    "the process starting at @xmath32 restricted to remain forever in @xmath44 is quite similar to the original unrestricted process for times in the relevant time range .",
    "so far we have restricted attention to initial conditions @xmath68 such that @xmath69 .",
    "we now show that to a large extent this requirement on the initial condition becomes unnecessary if one makes the hypothesis that the system is a metastable one , that is , that ( [ eq:2.11 ] ) holds . for such systems we will prove the following basic property : no matter what the initial condition @xmath68 is , provided it satisfies @xmath120 , within a time of order @xmath121 the system will either be in @xmath45 or else it will satisfy approximately the condition @xmath60=c$ ] .",
    "this means , therefore , that the two results described above can be applied whatever the initial condition , provided only that the process remains within @xmath44 for a short time .    to show this we first need an auxiliary result , which also depends on the extra assumption that defines metastability : if we consider an initial condition @xmath122 such that @xmath123 , then the probability that this initial condition ends up in @xmath45 , after a time significantly larger than @xmath124 has elapsed , is @xmath125 . indeed , in the relevant time range @xmath126",

    "this result further implies that for values of @xmath125 such that @xmath129 , where @xmath76 is defined by ( [ eq : a.33 ] ) , we have @xmath130 indeed , consider a system evolving from an initial state given by @xmath131 .",
    "the probability of finding the system in @xmath45 after a time @xmath9 will then be given by @xmath132 it then follows that @xmath133 now , equation ( [ eq : prob - p ] ) implies that , in the relevant time range , @xmath134 so that @xmath135 however , since the initial state was @xmath136 , which is essentially stationary in this time range , we have @xmath137 , giving @xmath138 since @xmath76 is negligibly small , we thus find that @xmath139 .    in a similar way",
    ", we can show that @xmath12 is non - negligible only for the states for which @xmath140 .",
    "this time consider @xmath141 after a time of order @xmath124 , at least @xmath142 of these states will end up in @xmath44 .",
    "thus , following the same line of reasoning as before , we can conclude that @xmath143 but our basic hypothesis is that for metastable states , @xmath144 is negligibly small , thus @xmath145 for @xmath146 . in other words ,",
    "if the condition for metastability , equation ( [ eq:2.12 ] ) , holds when @xmath44 is defined by the inequalities ( [ eq:2.103 ] ) , then a similar claim can be shown when the prefactor @xmath47 is replaced by essentially any other number well within @xmath76 and @xmath147 .",
    "this means , in fact , that outside a boundary set with relatively small measure both with respect to @xmath79 and to @xmath128 , the function @xmath41 takes only the values @xmath148 and @xmath43 .",
    "conversely , it is obvious that if @xmath145 for all @xmath125 within @xmath76 and @xmath149 , then the state will be metastable in the sense that equation ( [ eq:2.12 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "no similar converse statement holds for @xmath150 : in that case , @xmath150 was found to be negligible as a consequence of the fact that the probability of leaving @xmath44 within the relevant time range is negligibly small .",
    "this , as we have seen , is the case for arbitrary slowly decaying systems , if the initial condition @xmath32 satisfies @xmath77 .",
    "thus , for non - metastable slowly decaying states , @xmath150 would be negligible due to the very slowness of their decay .",
    "however , such modes would not correspond to metastable states unless assumption ( [ eq:2.12 ] ) held , and thus , @xmath145 .    for non - metastable slowly decaying systems",
    ", we have that @xmath151 is not negligible , indicating that one can find states @xmath6 in equilibrium with any value of @xmath41 , including @xmath152 , all of which would decay slowly . for such initial conditions , the almost certain absence of decay within the relevant time range can not be expected .",
    "in fact , instead of reaching a stationary state which suddenly decays , the properties of these systems will evolve continuously in time until they reach equilibrium .",
    "physical examples of such slowly decaying systems are hard to come by : the obvious instances that come to mind ( slow hydrodynamic modes , such as diffusion , necessary to reach a uniform equilibrium from a long- wavelength perturbation ) almost invariably involve a quasi - continuum gapless spectrum near zero , and are thus ruled out by our basic assumption . on the other hand ,",
    "a trivial , though unenlightening , example shows that non - metastable but slowly decaying states do exist : if one specific spin in an ising model is flipped at a much slower rate than all others , it will , as is easily verified , create a slowly decaying eigenstate which is not metastable in the sense that it does not satisfy",
    "( [ eq:2.11 ] )      the picture that emerges then , is that for systems having metastable states , after a relatively short transient time , the system will only be found in states @xmath6 for which either @xmath140 ( equilibrium ) or @xmath153 ( metastable ) , independently of the initial condition .",

    "nevertheless , the functions @xmath301 together with @xmath27 still form a linearly independent basis set , and the description of the system can be carried out in terms of these functions , which are essentially stationary in the relevant time range .",
    "now , for the slowly decaying states @xmath301 to describe metastability , an additional condition is still required , namely @xmath302 for all @xmath257 .",
    "thus , the functions @xmath301 are not only assumed to essentially be different from zero on disjoint sets , but also , the states they describe are assumed to be extremely improbable in equilibrium .",
    "the aim now is to show that , if the system starts from an arbitrary initial condition , then , with high probability , it either evolves to a state for which the @xmath303 are close to those of a @xmath304 or to equilibrium .",
    "further , this happens on a `` short '' timescale , that is , of the order of at most @xmath288 .",
    "as before , the first step in this direction is to consider the evolution of a system starting at an arbitrary @xmath32 .",
    "after a time of order @xmath288 has elapsed , the system will be described by the probability distribution @xmath305 we can express the functions @xmath276 in terms of the @xmath292 and the equilibrium distribution @xmath73 , as @xmath306 where the coefficients are obtained from ( [ eq:3a.5 ] ) and ( [ eq:3a.510 ] ) and from the orthogonality between @xmath12 and @xmath276 , as well as from the fact that @xmath12 is negligible on each @xmath279 .",
    "thus we can rewrite the expression for @xmath307 as @xmath308p_0(\\sigma )      + \\sum_{\\beta=1}^k\\left[\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^k       \\frac{c_\\alpha      ( { { \\sigma_0}})c_\\alpha(\\sigma_\\beta)}{z_\\beta }      \\right]q_\\beta(\\sigma).\\ ] ] the above expression means that the system has evolved to one of the states described by a @xmath309 distribution , with probability @xmath310 and will decay to equilibrium with probability @xmath311 thus , for the process @xmath57 starting at @xmath312 the functions @xmath313 $ ] tend to the values @xmath314 with probability @xmath315 , or to zero with probability @xmath316 , in a time of order @xmath288 .",
    "further , note that if we choose @xmath317 in equation ( [ eq:3a.533 ] ) , then we find @xmath318 otherwise , the system would quickly leave @xmath319 even though it had started at @xmath320 , which is contrary to what we have shown in equations ( [ eq:3a.3 ] ) and ( [ eq:3a.4 ] ) . this",
    "can also be understood as a statement that the functions @xmath321 are othonormal with respect to the scalar product ( [ eq:2.5 ] ) .",
    "thus , a system starting at an arbitrary initial state will either decay to equilibrium or evolve to a state described by one of the metastable distributions @xmath301 . if it reaches the metastable state @xmath301 , then the function @xmath322 for this process will grow to @xmath323 .",
    "this occurs in a time of order @xmath288 , after which the results pertaining to processes characterized by having the maximal value of @xmath322 apply .",
    "in particular , it will be very probable that the process remains in @xmath279 for a long time .",
    "further , once in the metastable state , it is described by the equilibrium distribution restricted to that region of phase space , which is again the expected physical behavior of metastable states .    finally , note that a formula analogous to @xmath156 , which was derived for the case of one metastable state , can be obtained as follows .",
    "we have @xmath324 ,      \\label{eq:3.a.534}\\ ] ] and upon substituting @xmath290 for @xmath6 and using the fact that @xmath325 , one finally obtains @xmath326    the other feature that can be discussed within this formalism is the decay path of a metastable system . for this concept to be clear cut , we will consider the case in which the decay rates of the metastable states , while still small , are very different from each other . in such a scenario , there are time scales on which the fastest metastable state has decayed with certainty whereas no other one has .",
    "the question then is whether we can evaluate the probability that a system originally in the short - lived metastable state will decay to another metastable state .",
    "since the eigenvalues of the evolution operator are assumed to be ordered in increasing magnitude , we denote by @xmath327 the distribution describing the metastable state with shortest lifetime .",
    "this distribution has support on @xmath328 which is characterized by @xmath329 .",
    "now , after a time greater than @xmath330 , the contributions from @xmath331 vanish and the initial distribution evolves into @xmath332 with the probability of finding the system in the initial metastable state vanishing : @xmath333 although @xmath334 is still normalized .",
    "in particular , this means that @xmath335 for @xmath336 .    expressing @xmath337 in terms of the remaining @xmath338",
    ", we find that the probability that the state be found in @xmath279 is given by @xmath339 where we have used ( [ eq:3a.5335 ] ) in the last equality .",
    "thus , the probability for the decay from this metastable state to another can be obtained from the values of the coefficients @xmath314 appearing in the previous equation .",
    "( note that the above expression implies that @xmath340 . )",
    "the probability that the state instead decays directly to equilibrium is @xmath341 thus , under certain circumstances , when the decay rates of the various eigenmodes are very different or their corresponding metastable states fall along different paths , the complete decay of the system can be described as an irreversible markov chain with transition probabilities given by equations ( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) .",
    "a fundamental issue in metastable systems concerns the possibility of describing them as thermodynamic equilibria ( in an extended sense ) of the system at hand .",
    "the fact that they decay to an equilibrium state which is in general quite different appears to preclude such an approach , as do the various results concerning the impossibility of analytically continuing the free energy beyond the coexistence curve . on the other hand ,",
    "the use of a thermodynamic approach is routine in the applied work on the subject .    in this work ,",
    "we have attempted to justify the thermodynamic approach starting from a markovian description .",
    "while this may , at first , seem to be an exceedingly restrictive assumption , a moment s thought will show the contrary : indeed , the markovian approximation is expected to become reasonable on large time scales .",
    "but metastability is essentially concerned with that time range which covers times much larger than any microscopic relaxation time but much shorter than the average nucleation time ( which we have , throughout the paper , called `` the relevant time range '' ) . if such a range does not exist , or if it is not large enough , then we may not meaningfully speak of a metastable state .",
    "the markovian approximation is therefore expected to be relevant within the time range of interest .    further , we assume that the markovian dynamics satisfies detailed balance .",
    "this last condition is not essential , and indeed , other approaches along similar lines have been made without the assumption of detailed balance @xcite .",
    "however , in addition to simplifying the derivation , this assumption allows the unambiguous identification of the probability distribution describing the equilibrium state with that of equilibrium statistical mechanics , thus justifying the use of concepts from equilibrium statistical mechanics and thermodynamics in the description of metastable states .    finally , we have limited ourselves systematically to finite systems . on the one hand",
    ", this comes from the fact that severe technicalities arise whenever infinite systems are considered as such . more specifically , however , as already argued by gaveau and schulman @xcite , the thermodynamic limit presents some unique difficulties for metastability : indeed , since the size of the critical nucleating droplet remains constant as the thermodynamic limit is attained , the time in which the first such droplet will arise goes to zero as the system size increases to infinity .",
    "our definition of a metastable state includes two components : first , it should involve an isolated eigenstate ( when the system has only one metastable state ) of the master operator having an exceptionally low eigenvalue .",
    "this eigenstate allows us to define the metastable region in the phase space of the system .",
    "second , we impose a technical condition ( [ eq:2.11 ] ) meaning that the probability of being in a metastable state at equilibrium is vanishingly small .",
    "the first condition serves to discard the possibility of slow decay mediated by long wavelength hydrodynamic modes .",
    "indeed these usually arise as a quasi - continuum of low - lying excitations and therefore can not satisfy the condition of being isolated . on the other hand ,",
    "the technical condition ( [ eq:2.11 ] ) is rather more difficult to understand .",
    "physically , however , since the properties of the metastable and equilibrium phases are markedly different , it is clear that we should make such a requirement of any metastable state , as was already pointed out in @xcite .    under the above hypotheses we have shown the following results : first , that any initial condition whatsoever will relax , in a short time , to a state which is either fully in the metastable region or to equilibrium .",
    "further , any state starting well inside the metastable region has a very low probability of leaving it in the relevant time range .",
    "we were also able to generalize these results to the case in which a finite number of metastable states exist .",
    "we could not , however , extend this to situations in which the number of metastable states grows with the system size : this clearly can not be done , since it would include , among others , the case of slowly decaying hydrodynamic modes , which correspond to a physically entirely different situation .",
    "a further important result allows to justify the thermodynamic treatment : we show that if one starts inside the metastable region , then a markov process which reflects the system whenever it attempts to leave the metastable region , is in fact close to the original physical process over the relevant time range .",
    "we may therefore , for properties which can be observed over the relevant time range , use this `` restricted '' process instead of the original one : all the difficulties associated with the existence of nucleation then disappear , so we may apply the entire machinery of equilibrium statistical mechanics to it ( green  kubo formulae , linear response and so on ) while remaining close to the correct answer for the original system .",
    "the main open issue clearly concerns systems with a macroscopic number of low - lying eigenstates of the master operator .",
    "at least two apparently different classes of such systems are known : on the one hand , as we have said before , systems in which slow hydrodynamic modes play a role . on the other hand ,",
    "both structural and spin glasses are assumed to exhibit a large number of metastable states .",
    "clearly , neither can , at present , be treated by the methods presented here , but their extension to such systems certainly presents an interesting challenge .",
