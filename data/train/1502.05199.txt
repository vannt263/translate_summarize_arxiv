    "the discovery of neutrino oscillations by the super - kamiokande ( super - k ) experiment in 1998  @xcite opened a new window to explore physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "evidence of neutrino oscillations is one of the most convincing experimental proofs known today for the existence of bsm physics at work .",
    "the mixing parameters of neutrinos were found to be remarkably different from those of quarks , which suggests the presence of an unknown flavor symmetry waiting to be explored .",
    "the extremely small masses of neutrinos compared with those of their charged partners lead to the preferred scenario of a seesaw mechanism  @xcite , in which small neutrino masses are a reflection of the ultra - high energy scale of bsm physics .",
    "furthermore , a theoretical framework called leptogenesis points to the intriguing possibility that @xmath0 asymmetries related to flavor mixing among the three generations of neutrinos may have played an important role in creating the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe  @xcite .",
    "this makes a study of the full picture of neutrino masses and mixings and the measurement of the @xmath0 asymmetry in the neutrino sector among the most important and urgent subjects in today s elementary particle physics world .",
    "@xmath0 asymmetry in the neutrino sector arising from the presence of the phase which corresponds to the kobayashi - maskawa phase  @xcite in the quark sector , can only be seen if all the three mixing angles governing neutrino oscillations differ from zero .",
    "the super - k detector has successfully measured all three angles .",
    "the angle @xmath16 was first measured in atmospheric neutrino observations  @xcite , @xmath17 was constrained in solar neutrino observations  @xcite ( together with another water cherenkov detector sno  @xcite ) , and the evidence of non - zero @xmath18 was found by t2k  @xcite which used super - k as the far detector . in 2013 , t2k established @xmath19 oscillation with 7.3@xmath13 significance , leading the way towards @xmath0 violation measurements in neutrinos  @xcite in combination with precise measurements of @xmath18 by reactor neutrino experiments  @xcite .",
    "the highly successful super - k program indicates that hyper - kamiokande ( hyper - k ) is well placed to discover @xmath0 violation .    in this paper ,",
    "the physics potential of a long baseline neutrino experiment using the hyper - kamiokande detector and a neutrino beam from the j - parc proton synchrotron is presented .",
    "the hyper - k detector is designed as a next generation underground water cherenkov detector that serves as a far detector of a long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment for the j - parc neutrino beam and as a detector capable of observing proton decays , atmospheric and solar neutrinos , and neutrinos from other astrophysical origins .",
