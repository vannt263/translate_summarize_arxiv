    "@xcite , ion - driven fast ignition ( ifi ) has been taking an increasing interest over the last years .",
    "ion fast ignition @xcite offers several advantages over efi , such as generation of collimated beams , well known interaction with the plasma and higher flexibility .",
    "some examples of such a flexibility are the control of ion spectra @xcite , the possibility of choosing the optimal ion species @xcite , including deuterium ions @xcite , and the use of multiple beams for target irradiation @xcite .",
    "ifi progress so far can be summarized by the experimental achievement of the required ion energies , high conversion efficiencies @xcite and ion beam focusing @xcite .",

    "most of the ignition studies carried out so far are based on rather ideal target configurations and simplified ion interaction models .",
    "for instance , these models do not take into account cone tip and coronal plasma energy deposition nor scattering of the beam ions in the hot plasma between the cone tip and the dense core .",
    "fully integrated numerical modeling of the ifi scheme , from beam generation to fuel ignition , is not possible today with the present computer resources .",
    "it requires the integration of physical processes with very different spatial and temporal scales . in this paper",

    "the beam is generated by the tnsa scheme @xcite , which yields ions with a maxwellian energy distribution . in order to reduce the ion time spread along the stand - off distance from the generation foil to the dense fuel",
    ", we assume that a re - entrant cone is attached to the compressed fuel for generating the ion beam as close as possible to the dt .",
    "two configurations of the compressed fuel at stagnation have been considered .",

    "the simulation box corresponding to this case is shown in fig .",

    "diamond - like - carbon ( dlc ) , aluminum , copper and gold have been chosen as materials for the cone tip in order to check the importance of ion energy losses and scattering on the beam energy deposition in the core .",
    "in realistic target designs , the cone should be protected from the x - rays coming from shell implosion by using heavier materials , such as lead or gold , at the cone walls .",

    "ignition energies depend on the target density distribution and , in particular , on the coronal plasma surrounding the core . for the 1d imploded density profile with the long coronal plasma shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1]b , the ignition energies are minimized for the optimal ion temperatures of @xmath50 = 8 mev and @xmath51 = 200 mev for proton and carbon ion beams , respectively . for the super - gaussian density profile almost without coronal plasma shown in fig .",

    "we analyze first the perfectly collimated beams , figs .",
    "[ fig:8]a , c and e. protons with a maxwellian energy distribution show a more localized energy deposition than carbon ions with the same distribution .",
    "this can be explained by the better balance between range lengthening ( which is more pronounced for protons than for carbon ions ) and energy spread found for proton beams .",
    "this effect is even more evident by comparing the energy deposition by maxwellian and quasi - monoenergetic carbon ions , which have a very small energy spread and , thus , their energy is deposited in a volume determined mainly by the range lengthening effect .",
    "the higher energy deposition by the maxwellian ions in the coronal plasma is also remarkable .",
    "note in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] that the beams have a penetration into the dense core around 1.5 g@xmath4 , and slightly higher for the quasi - monoenergetic ions .",
    "these values are higher than the optimal value of 1.2 g@xmath4 @xcite due to the energy deposition in the coronal plasma .",
    "the coupling efficiencies , defined as the energy deposited in the dt at densities higher than 200 g@xmath5 , for the perfectly collimated beams are 0.58 for the maxwellian proton and carbon beams , and 0.70 for the quasi - monoenergetic carbon ions , similar to those reported in refs .",
    "coupling efficiencies rise substantially for the super - gaussian dt density distribution of fig .",

    "again , these ions penetrate deeper in the core , heating a much larger volume than the maxwellian ions .",
    "the ignition energies for different beams as a function of the ion divergence half - angle are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] .",
    "these energies have been obtained as described in section iii.a . as expected ,",
    "the ignition energies show a rapid increase with the beam divergence angle .",
    "the small differences between maxwellian proton and carbon ions can be explained by the lower range lengthening of carbon ions , which does not balance completely their energy spread along the source - target distance .",
    "it is relevant here to recall that ignition energies are almost independent of the beam ion atomic number , provided that ions have the optimal mean kinetic energy , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "the much lower ignition energies found for quasi - monoenergetic ions show the strong dependence of ignition energies on ion spectrum and the better coupling of quasi - monoenergetic ions with the plasma .    for maxwellian ions ,",

    "they are within the bottom shaded area of fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] . note that for the case of low areal density , the kinetic energy of carbon ions has been reduced from 650 to 400 mev in order to have the optimal beam - target coupling .    for the divergence half - angles of 5@xmath66 found in planar foils experiments @xcite and assuming a laser - to - ion conversion efficiency of 15% , our results show that it would be sufficient with an igniting laser beam energy between 130 and 90 kj for maxwellian ions , and from 75 to 60 kj for quasi - monoenergetic ions , depending on the coronal plasma areal density .",
    "ignition energies of the target shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a heated by maxwellian protons with temperature @xmath72 7 mev . curve labeled by squares shows the ignition energies for protons injected at the inner surface of the cone tip .",
    "the curve labeled by diamonds corresponds to protons injected at the outer surface of the cone tip and the curve labeled by triangles to protons injected at @xmath11 = 65 @xmath0 m . in all cases the beam spot diameter is 30 @xmath0 m . ]      in the cases analyzed in figs .",
    "5 to 9 , we have assumed that the beam is focused by the cone walls on the inner surface of the cone tip . in this case , the stand - off distance between the focusing point and the dt core is maximum and the beam has more room to spread out . as there is experimental and simulation evidence of beam focusing beyond the cone",
    "tip @xcite , it is worthwhile extending the study carried out in the last sections to situations in which the beam is focused closer to the dense core . in this case , the dt heating by divergent beams is more efficient due to the lower beam radius at the core .    in order to analyze the effect of the beam focusing point on the ignition energies ,",
    "two additional cases have been considered : ( i ) a proton beam focused on the outer surface of the cone tip and ( ii ) a proton beam focused 40 @xmath0 m away from the dense core ( @xmath11 = 65 @xmath0 m ) . in both cases , protons are focused on a 30 @xmath0 m diameter spot and have a maxwellian energy distribution with @xmath50 = 7 mev .",
    "the ignition energies obtained for the 1d imploded target density profile are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] .",
    "note the large reduction of the ignition energies when the proton beam is focused closer to the dt core .",
    "for instance , if the beam is focused 40 @xmath0 m away from the core , the ignition energies @xmath76 are much lower than in the reference case and depend weakly on the divergence half - angle .",
    "even if the beam is focused on the outer rather than on the inner surface of the cone tip there is a substantial reduction of @xmath76 , specially for large divergence half - angles .",
    "our simulations have evidenced that ion beam ignition energies have been underestimated so far by using simplified energy deposition models and target designs . fast ion spectrum , focusing spot diameter and position , beam divergence and ion scattering with the cone tip are key parameters that determine ignition energies .",
    "taking into account all these parameters requires a kinetic treatment of ion energy deposition such as the linear fokker - planck model used in this work .",
    "thus , our results generalize those obtained with the standard linear particle tracking method used so far .",
    "ignition energies of compressed targets have been evaluated in the limits of high and low coronal plasma areal densities .",
    "the goal has been to obtain an upper and lower limits of beam energy requirements for ifi .",
    "the results of our study can be summarized as follows :    \\i ) the ion beam diameter on the dense core should not exceed around 40 @xmath0 m , which is even higher than the focal spots inferred from experiments @xcite and obtained in large scale pic simulations of ion acceleration in the ifi scenario @xcite .",
    "beam focusing is one of the most challenging issues of ifi , with high chances of success in future ifi experiments .",
    "\\ii ) the cone tip material should be as light as possible in order to reduce ion scattering .",
    "intermediate materials such as copper are acceptable because they give rise to a modest increase of the ignition energies when compared with light materials .",
    "\\iii ) as expected , ignition energies depend strongly on the beam divergence .",
    "our calculations show that for the beam divergence half - angle of 5@xmath66 measured in the recent experiments , the ion beam ignition energies of the targets considered here are from 13 to 20 kj , depending on the density distribution of the imploded fuel .",
    "these energies are substantially higher than the standard ignition energies of 10 kj considered so far .",
    "\\iv ) assuming the laser - to - proton conversion efficiency of 15% found in recent experiments @xcite , the laser beam energies required for ignition are in between 90 and 130 kj for small and large coronal plasma areal densities , respectively . in principle",
    ", these energies could be affordable with the present laser technology .",
    "\\v ) the position of the ion beam focusing point is crucial to reduce the ignition energies . if it is beyond the cone tip ,",
    "the ignition energies would be reduced substantially and would be less sensitive to the ion divergence .",
    "\\vi ) if beam focusing were demonstrated for advanced schemes , such as the break - out afterburner scheme @xcite , quasi - monoenergetic ions instead of tnsa ions should be used due to their better coupling with the compressed fuel .",
    "the challenge over the forthcoming years will be to perform experiments relevant for a full characterization of ion generation , focusing and interaction with imploded targets in conditions close to those found in ifi .",
    "the success of ifi will depend on the possibility of generating ions by means of high contrast , highly uniform laser beams and focusing the ion beam into 20 - 30 @xmath0 m spots as close as possible to the imploded dt core .",
    "future studies will include pic simulations of ion acceleration and focusing to get a full characterization of the ion source .",
    "this will be followed by integrated simulations similar to those presented here , but with a self - consistent ion source .",
