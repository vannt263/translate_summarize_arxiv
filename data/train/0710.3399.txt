    "dynamics in the solar corona takes on a wide range of forms . on one hand ,",
    "the corona is the setting for the most violent eruptions in the solar system : solar flares and coronal mass ejections @xcite . on the other , coronal",
    "heating makes the corona almost a thousand times hotter than the photosphere , even in the quiet sun @xcite .",
    "@xcite unified these two phenomena by proposing that micro- and nano - flares , less energetic cousins of eruptive flares , heat the corona .",
    "this model gained credence from studies showing that solar flares exhibit power law statistics @xcite over a wide range of scales for many quantities .",
    "[ see @xcite for a review . ] in addition , stellar flares have similar light curves to solar flares @xcite and also exhibit power law statistics @xcite , suggesting that the physics of the solar corona is generic to sun - like stars .",
    "coronal dynamics remains an active research area @xcite .",
    "details of the eruption process including how magnetic energy is stored , how eruptions onset , and how the stored energy is converted to other forms are still open questions .",
    "in addition , while micro- and nano - flares are believed to be a major contributor to coronal heating , the authors know of no theory which explains why the coronal temperature and density have the values they have , as opposed to larger or smaller values .    in this paper",
    ", we propose that the condition of the corona is regulated by magnetic reconnection @xcite , a dynamical process which converts magnetic energy into kinetic energy and heat and energizes particles . magnetic energy is stored during collisional ( slow ) reconnection , which has been shown to drive the coronal plasma toward lower collisionality @xcite .",
    "if the plasma becomes marginally collisionless , a bifurcation in the underlying dynamics of reconnection occurs @xcite .",
    "this bifurcation , which occurs when two length scales @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( to be defined below ) are comparable , catastrophically initiates fast ( hall ) reconnection , releasing the stored energy in the form of an eruption .",
    "the condition of marginal collisionality , therefore , sets an upper bound on how hot the coronal plasma can be for a given density . the continual driving toward lower collisionality of the pre - flare corona by slow reconnection enforces the self - organization of the corona to a state of marginal collisionality where @xmath2 .",
    "we present finer details of this process below .",
    "then , we perform the first observational test of this model using a large sample of data from stellar flares on sun - like stars .",
    "we find that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are comparable for every event in the sample , indicating that stellar coronae do self - organize into a marginally collisional state .",
    "magnetic reconnection depends strongly on the collisionality of the plasma .",
    "collisional ( sweet - parker ) reconnection @xcite is exceedingly slow . the thickness @xmath0 of the sweet - parker diffusion region is given by @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the alfvn speed , @xmath5 is the strength of the reconnecting magnetic field , @xmath6 is the ion mass , @xmath7 is the density , @xmath8 is the resistivity , and @xmath9 is the length of the sweet - parker diffusion region in the outflow direction .",
    "the normalized reconnection rate @xmath10 is @xmath11 for coronal parameters , where @xmath12 is the inflow speed .",
    "collisionless ( hall ) reconnection has a reconnection rate of the order of 0.1 @xcite , six orders of magnitude faster than sweet - parker reconnection for coronal parameters .",
    "recent studies @xcite showed that the transition from collisional to collisionless reconnection is catastrophic , occurring when @xmath0 becomes smaller than the ion gyroradius @xmath1 . at this scale , magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) breaks down and the hall effect ( absent in mhd ) allows reconnection to be fast @xcite .",
    "the transition can be described as a bifurcation @xcite which takes stable equilibria out of existence as a control parameter ( @xmath13 ) varies .",
    "the relevant gyroradius @xmath1 for anti - parallel reconnection is the ion inertial scale @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the ion cyclotron frequency , @xmath17 is the ion plasma frequency , and @xmath18 is the ion charge . for reconnection with a ( guide ) magnetic field along the current sheet , the relevant gyroradius becomes @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the sound speed @xcite .    to see how magnetic reconnection self - organizes the corona , consider an active region . before an eruption",
    ", the plasma can not be collisionless : if it were , the stored magnetic energy would be rapidly released by hall reconnection .",
    "therefore , the pre - flare active region must be collisional .",
    "since ( collisional ) sweet - parker reconnection is exceedingly slow , magnetic energy can be stored .",
    "[ by `` collisional '' , we mean @xmath21 , which , using eqs .",
    "( [ deltaspdef ] ) and ( [ didef ] ) , is equivalent to @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ion - electron collision frequency .",
    "therefore , reconnection is collisional when the ion transit time along the sweet - parker diffusion region is longer than the ion - electron collision time .",
    "see also @xcite . ]",
    "when sweet - parker reconnection begins in the corona , _",
    "e.g. , _ as a result of two coronal flux tubes coming together , the reconnecting magnetic field @xmath5 is initially much weaker than the strong asymptotic magnetic field in the core of the flux tube , _",
    "i.e. , _ the reconnection is embedded within a wider current sheet . from equation  ( [ deltaspdef ] )",
    ", the thickness of the diffusion region will be relatively wide , so that @xmath24 .",
    "it was shown @xcite that embedded sweet - parker reconnection spontaneously self - drives the current sheet to thinner scales , even without external forcing .",
    "this is because the reconnection inflow convects stronger magnetic fields into the diffusion region , which causes @xmath0 to decrease [ see eq .",
    "( [ deltaspdef ] ) ] .",
    "thus , the reconnection process itself self - drives the system toward lower collisionality .",
    "if the asymptotic field is strong enough so that @xmath25 , _ i.e. , _ the system becomes marginally collisionless , then a bifurcation causes hall reconnection to begin , eruptively releasing the stored energy .",
    "[ we note in passing that if @xmath5 in an active region is not strong enough to ever satisfy @xmath26 for a given density and temperature then no eruption occurs , potentially providing an observational constraint on which active regions erupt and which do not . ] after the eruption , the corona returns to a collisional state , and the process begins again .",
    "the continual self - driving of the corona toward lower collisionality keeps coronal parameters near the critical condition where the bifurcation occurs ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "we propose that this process regulates the temperature of the corona .",
    "if the temperature @xmath27 of the corona is larger than the critical value , the spitzer resistivity @xmath8 is smaller ( since @xmath28 ) . from equation  ( [ deltaspdef ] ) ,",
    "a smaller @xmath8 allows a smaller @xmath5 to initiate an eruption . as such , less magnetic energy is stored and released , and the corona cools . alternately ,",
    "if the corona is cooler than the critical value , a larger magnetic field is required to set off an eruption .",
    "more magnetic energy is stored and released , increasing the temperature .",
    "either way , the temperature is driven back to the critical value .",
    "@xcite independently proposed a similar model based on the density , which we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec - disc ] .",
    "observational verification of this model entails confirming that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are comparable at fast reconnection onset .",
    "laboratory experiments @xcite are consistent with this condition , but direct observations are impossible because the length scales are not resolvable .",
    "indirect verification is possible by estimating @xmath0 and @xmath1 for coronal parameters . for a solar active region ,",
    "one finds both length scales to be a few meters , as has been noted previously @xcite .",
    "an important question is whether this agreement is indicative of a general mechanism or is just a coincidence for solar parameters .",
    "we use data from a recent study @xcite which analyzed 134 eruptive flares from 44 stars of spectral type f , g , k , and m , using the deep survey / spectrometer instrument on the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ euve _ ) satellite .",
    "the data come from a single instrument on a single satellite , so there are no spurious variations due to different instrumental characteristics .",
    "see @xcite for a thorough discussion of the data .",
    "the @xmath18-folding time @xmath29 for the flare signal to decay and the emission measure @xmath30 were extracted from flare light curves .",
    "because of interruptions in _ euve _ data during some flares , @xcite presented the @xmath29 values for each flare as a unique value , a range of values or an upper bound .",
    "we retain events having a particular value or a range ( using the average ) and omit events given as bounds , leaving 107 events from 37 stars .",
    "post - flare parameters ( the temperature @xmath27 , density @xmath7 , minimum magnetic field @xmath31 , and length @xmath32 and cross sectional area @xmath33 of coronal loops ) were derived @xcite from @xmath29 and @xmath30 using an approach due to @xcite , which assumes that @xmath29 is comparable to the radiative and conductive cooling times .",
    "taking @xmath34 , one finds @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 , and @xmath37 are constants ( in cgs units ) . a lower bound for the magnetic field @xmath31",
    "is estimated by requiring the magnetic pressure @xmath38 to be at least as large as the gas pressure @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is boltzmann s constant , to maintain a coronal loop . as a test of the model , @xcite surveyed the literature for independent measurements of @xmath41 , and @xmath31 for the stars in their study , finding that 178 of 212 measurements were consistent with the haisch model .",
    "this justifies treating the derived parameters as valid independent of the haisch model .",
    "we first verify that the haisch model gives reasonable results for solar parameters .",
    "eruptive solar flares have @xmath42 sec and @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "using these values , the haisch model predicts post - flare parameters of @xmath44 mk , @xmath45 @xmath46 , @xmath47 cm , and @xmath48 g. compact solar flares have @xmath49 sec and @xmath50 @xmath51 @xcite . using these values",
    ", the haisch model gives @xmath52 mk , @xmath53 @xmath51 , @xmath54 cm , and @xmath55 g. these ranges of @xmath56 and @xmath31 are consistent with independent empirical values obtained from images and x - ray data for flaring loops in the sun @xcite .    to calculate @xmath0 and @xmath14 from the haisch model , we use @xmath31 for the upstream magnetic field and @xmath7 for the density .",
    "sweet - parker current sheets extend to system scales @xcite , so @xmath9 is on the order of the coronal loop radius @xmath57 , consistent with the haisch model .",
    "finally , we use @xmath27 to calculate the spitzer resistivity @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the electron mass and @xmath60 $ ] is the coulomb logarithm .",
    "use of this formula is justified because the electron mean free path ( @xmath61 km for solar conditions , where @xmath62 is the electron thermal speed and @xmath63 is the electron - ion collision frequency ) is small compared to length scales in the outflow direction ( @xmath64 km ) and along the current sheet ( @xmath65 km ) .",

    "it is encouraging that the slope of the line in fig .",
    "[ spvsdi ] is consistent with unity .",
    "however , there are ambiguities in the data analysis .",
    "for example , we used @xmath14 as the critical length scale , whereas @xmath75 is more applicable to the corona ( but more difficult to estimate ) .",
    "these scales differ by a factor of @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the ratio of gas pressure to total magnetic pressure . if @xmath78 in the corona , this introduces a factor of a few .",
    "the present analysis does not intend to distinguish between the two gyroradii ; rather , the results demonstrate that @xmath0 is within a factor of a few of the critical length scale @xmath1 in active stellar coronae .    a caveat of the result in fig .",
    "[ spvsdi ] pertains to how the parameters are derived in the haisch model . using equations ( [ deltaspdef ] ) , ( [ didef ] ) , and ( [ spitzer ] ) , using @xmath79 , and eliminating @xmath5 by defining the ratio of gas pressure to magnetic pressure in the reconnecting magnetic field as @xmath80",
    ", we find @xmath81 .",
    "treating @xmath82 as a fixed parameter and eliminating @xmath83 and @xmath32 using equation ( [ haisch ] ) gives @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a constant .",
    "the slow dependence on @xmath86 significantly suppresses scatter in the observational data when evaluating @xmath87 .",
    "however , the magnitude of @xmath87 is unconstrained by the haisch model , so the slope of the line in fig .",
    "[ spvsdi ] being of order unity is significant .",
    "furthermore , since the data obtained using the haisch model agrees with independent determinations of the same quantities from other studies @xcite , it is reasonable to assert that data obtained independently from the haisch model would fall close to the same line .",
