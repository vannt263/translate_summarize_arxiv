    "<S> the structure and dynamics of relaxors has been one of the long - standing challenges in solid - state physics , with the current model of polar nanoregions in a non - polar matrix providing only a qualitative description of the relaxor phase transitions . in this paper , we investigate the local structure and dynamics in 75%pbmg@xmath0nb@xmath1o@xmath2 - 25%pbtio@xmath2 ( pmn - pt ) using molecular dynamics simulations and the dynamic pair distribution function technique . </S>",
    "<S> we show for the first time that relaxor transitions can be described by local order parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that structurally , the relaxor phase is characterized by the presence of highly anisotropic correlations between the local cation displacements . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations resemble the hydrogen bond network in water . </S>",
    "<S> our findings contradict the current polar nanoregion model ; instead , we suggest a new model of a homogeneous random network of anisotropically coupled dipoles .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , relaxor ferroelectrics have become important in technological applications , resulting in a revival of interest in this longstanding fundamental scientific problem .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite compared with normal ferroelectrics , relaxors exhibit a stronger piezoelectric effect , a high permittivity over a broad temperature range , and unique dielectric response with strong frequency dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the inverse dielectric response starts deviating from the curie - weiss law at the burns temperature ( @xmath3 ) , significantly above the curie temperature ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the past several decades , these effects have been ascribed to the appearance of polar nanoregions ( pnrs ) which form spherical or elliptic clusters in non - polar matrix at @xmath3 due to random fields in the material , with the size and the interactions of the pnr increasing as @xmath5 is lowered to the vogel - fulcher freezing temperature ( @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , this model provides only a qualitative description of the changes in the structure through relaxor transitions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , recent studies using raman , nmr , neutron scattering pair distribution functions ( pdfs ) , and diffuse scattering techniques  @xcite have demonstrated that static local polarization on at least a nanosecond time scale appears only at a temperature @xmath7 roughly halfway between @xmath3 and @xmath6 .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we use molecular dynamics simulations and analysis of pdfs for 75%pb(mg@xmath0nb@xmath1)o@xmath2 - 25%pbtio@xmath2 ( pmn - pt ) to show that relaxor transitions are characterized by well - defined and observable local order parameters and are due to the onset of anisotropic nanoscale correlations of the in - phase cation motions . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations do not form clusters and therefore can not be explained by the current pnr model . </S>",
    "<S> rather , the couplings between displacements are analogous to the network of hydrogen bonds in water . both in water and in relaxors , </S>",
    "<S> the presence of such a network in a polar environment leads to unique physical properties . </S>",

    "<S> , a short pb - o peak appears at @xmath11550  k , same as the experimental @xmath3=550  k of 0.75pmn-0.25pt .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this can be clearly seen in a 1d plot of the integrated high - frequency dpdf intensity at @xmath9=2.38    versus temperature ( figure 1e ) , where a more rapid rise of dpdf intensity with lower @xmath5 sets in at 550  k. though the color change in figure 1d is subtle , the 1d plot for the integrated lower - frequency dpdf intensity at @xmath9=3.3    ( figure 1f ) shows two changes of slope at 550  k and at 425  k. the transition at 425  k is at a temperature that is intermediate between the experimental @xmath3=550  k and @xmath6=380  k of 0.75pmn-0.25pt .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the integrated lower frequency dpdf intensity for the short pb - o distance ( figure 1d ) shows a split of the pb - o peak away from the main pb - o and o - o distances peak at 2.83   . </S>",
    "<S> since the splitting gives rise to a decrease of the dpdf intensity at the distance between the two peaks , we examine the integrated lower frequency dpdf intensity for @xmath12    ( figure 1 g ) . </S>",
    "<S> this shows two changes of slope at 525  k and at 350  k , with the rapid intensity decrease and strong peak splitting appearing at temperatures slightly below the experimental @xmath6=380  k of 0.75pmn-0.25pt . </S>",
    "<S> similar features are present in the integrated dpdf intensities for pmn obtained by dmowski _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> ( figure 1a - b ) . </S>",
    "<S> here , in integrated dpdf in the higher frequency interval ( figure 1a ) , the 2.4    peak appears at @xmath11600  k , close to @xmath3=630  k of pmn . in the lower frequency ( figure1b ) , at @xmath13    there is a strong intensity enhancement at @xmath11300  k , between pmn @xmath3=630  k and @xmath6=200  k ,  @xcite and a faint increase in intensity above 300  k. the 2.4    peak visibly splits off from the main 2.8    peak at @xmath11170  k , slightly below @xmath6=200  k. the correspondence between the transition temperatures found in our dpdf data and the experimental 0.75pmn-0.25pt values as well as the good agreement between the main features of the experimental pmn and computational 0.75pmn-0.25pt dpdfs show that our simulations are a good basis for investigating the structure and dynamics in relaxor ferroelectrics .    </S>",
    "<S> cation - oxygen instantaneous and time - averaged pdfs ( figure 2 ) reveal the changes in the dynamics as the temperature is lowered and the system undergoes a sequence of transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the peak of the instantaneous pb - o partial pdf @xmath14 presented in figure 2a corresponds to the pb - o@xmath15 cage and is asymmetric for all temperatures with the positively skewed distributions of @xmath14 above @xmath16  k. this means that pb atoms shift away from the center of their o@xmath15 cages even in the high - temperature paraelectric phase , in agreement with previous results .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite unlike @xmath14 , the time - averaged pb - o partial pdf @xmath17 in figure 2b shows almost symmetric pb - o peaks centered at 2.81    for @xmath18475  k , indicating a small and temperature independent time - averaged pb atom off - centering . </S>",
    "<S> such small time - averaged local cation displacements were observed in previous simulations and are due to the strong local random fields created by the local variations in the @xmath19-cation arrangement .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    to clearly show the changes of local structure with temperature , we use the short pb - o peak positions for @xmath14 and @xmath17 to calculate the magnitude of the instantaneous and the time - averaged static local pb displacements ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) shown in figure 2c . </S>",
    "<S> these are obtained by subtracting the peak position from 2.83    pb - o distance of the high symmetry pb - o@xmath15 cage at the 0.75pmn-0.25pt lattice constants . </S>",

    "<S> , title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]    examination of the data in figure 2c shows that three phase transitions occur at @xmath3=550  k , @xmath7=450  k and @xmath6=375  k , separating four distinct regions . </S>",
    "<S> the values of all three transition temperatures are agreement with experimental 0.75pmn-0.25pt data .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for @xmath27 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are both small and change little with temperature . for 450  k@xmath28550  k , @xmath20 increases rapidly as @xmath5 is lowered , while @xmath21 is the same as for @xmath29  k. the increasing dynamic displacement component @xmath22 indicates the onset of the dynamic relaxor phase . for 400  k@xmath28450  k , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 increase slowly and @xmath22 starts to plateau . </S>",
    "<S> finally , at @xmath5=375  k , another transition takes place with @xmath21 increasing rapidly and @xmath22 decreasing and both then saturating at their low temperature values , as the system undergoes a transition into the frozen phase .    the transition at @xmath7 is characterized by the change in @xmath21 ; we therefore assign the difference between the calculated @xmath21 and the @xmath21 of the paraelectric phase as the order parameter for the low - temperature phases at @xmath30475  k. the @xmath31 is related to the edwards - anderson spin glass order parameter @xmath32 , defined as @xmath32=@xmath33  @xcite , which measures the average magnitude of the static local polarization in the material and has been used to model relaxor behavior .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite using nmr experiments on pmn and an analytical random - bond random - field spin model , blinc _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ have previously shown that @xmath32 rises above zero at a temperature between @xmath3 and @xmath6 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this is similar to our finding of @xmath31 rising above the paraelectric value at @xmath7=450  k. since @xmath32 and @xmath21 _ do not _ change at @xmath3 , the freezing of the local displacements that has been the focus of previous investigations is not the relevant process for the onset of relaxor behavior at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> rather , the transition at @xmath3 is characterized by the increase in the local scalar magnitude of the instantaneous cation displacements @xmath20 ( figure 2c ) . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore assign the difference between the calculated @xmath20 and the @xmath20 of the paraelectric phase as the order parameter for the dynamic relaxor phase found for @xmath11475  k@xmath28550  k.    inspections of nb - o and ti - o partial pdfs ( figure 2d ) show trends similar to those observed for pb displacements ( mg cation displacement magnitudes are close to zero for all temperatures ) . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference between the pb and @xmath19-cation displacements is that the dynamic component of the off - center displacement @xmath34 peaks at a higher temperature for the @xmath19-cations than for the pb atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the cation - oxygen bonding is more distributed and flexible in the pbo@xmath15 cuboctahedron than in the @xmath19o@xmath35 octahedron . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the freezing temperature of the pb displacements lower than for the nb and ti cations .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that a local quantity such as pb displacement magnitude shows order parameter behavior implies that local interactions are at the root of relaxor behavior . </S>",
    "<S> enhanced local correlation between the pb displacements is the physical origin of the increase in @xmath20 for @xmath36  k. pb atom displacements in neighboring unit cells are coupled , so that correlated displacements in the same direction ( even if time - averaged to zero ) allow a greater magnitude of individual pb ion off - centering . </S>",

    "<S> , title=\"fig:\",width=316 ]    we compare pb - pb @xmath8 along the ( 100 ) , ( 110 ) and ( 111 ) high symmetry directions . in fig.3 , we show only the ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) directions since the intensities along ( 111 ) directions are only slightly weaker than the intensities along ( 110 ) directions . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath8 reveal the spatial extent and the frequency spectrum of the correlated cation motion . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the correlations between pb displacements are enhanced between @xmath6 and @xmath3 and exhibit a strong direction dependence . </S>",
    "<S> starting at @xmath3 , the @xmath8 data along the ( 100 ) direction show a strong increase in intensity at low @xmath25 , with a shift of the low frequency peak to below 0.1 mev as @xmath5 approaches @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity weakens and the peak position changes as @xmath9 increases from 4    to 20   , but the appearance of low-@xmath25 peaks at @xmath3 and their shift to lower frequencies with lower @xmath5 is present for all dpdf along the ( 100 ) direction . by contrast , although the ( 110 ) and ( 111 ) directions also show peaks in the in - phase vibration intensity , they decay dramatically with increasing distance . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for all temperatures , we find essentially zero dpdf intensity for the ( 330 ) pb - pb peaks , which indicates a lack of correlated in - phase oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that below @xmath3 , the coupling between the local dipoles created by pb displacements is anisotropic , with strong interactions only between the dipoles located along cartesian directions . </S>",
    "<S> anisotropic correlations between cation displacements were also very recently reported by akbarzadeh et al . in ba(zr , </S>",
    "<S> ti)o@xmath2 relaxor .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the direction dependences of the @xmath19-cation-@xmath19-cation correlations are more substantial and anisotropically strong coupling , confined to @xmath19-cation sublattice , along the cartesian directions is present even in the high temperature paraelectric phase of pmn - pt . </S>",
    "<S> ( see in supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is in disagreement with the current model of pnr inside a non - polar matrix , where correlations should extend along all directions as the temperature is lowered below @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> the stronger correlation along the ( 100 ) direction indicates that the pb displacement coupling is not solely due to the dipole - dipole interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy is induced by the through - oxygen interactions between nearest - neighbor cations that share one ( for the @xmath19-cations ) or more ( for pb ) o atoms along a cartesian direction in the @xmath39o@xmath2 structure . </S>",
    "<S> these interactions are stronger for the @xmath19-cations , due to the much higher average bond valence of each @xmath19-cation - oxygen bond ( 4/6 ) compared to the valence of the average pb - o bond ( 1/6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sharing brings strong @xmath19-cation displacement coupling even in the paraelectric phase . on the other hand , for pb atoms , the coupling along ( 100 ) is weaker and is therefore absent above @xmath3 .    despite the presence of strong @xmath19-cation-@xmath19-cation displacement correlations , at @xmath27 pmn - pt still exhibits normal paraelectric behavior . </S>",
    "<S> we ascribe this to the fact that the strongly correlated @xmath19-cation displacement chains are one dimensional and therefore can not undergo a phase transition into a more ordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the through - oxygen interactions , the chains of the @xmath19-cation-@xmath19-cation correlations enhance pb atom correlations along the cartesian directions . at @xmath3 , as the pb atom displacements next to the strongly correlated @xmath19-cation chains become correlated , the correlated region becomes three - dimensional , enabling a phase transition from a disordered paraelectric phase to a locally correlated dynamic relaxor phase .    </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the region of correlation is strongly anisotropic , with a network of tube - like correlations along the cartesian axes and a radius of around 7.5    in the other directions . </S>",
    "<S> this is the same as @xmath40    estimated for the size of pnr by gehring _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> based on the `` waterfall effect '' in 0.8pmn-0.20pt .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the change of the low @xmath25 part of the spectrum from a sharp peak at @xmath27 to a broad band absorption for @xmath41 is in agreement with the waterfall effect observed by neutron - scattering experiments in relaxor materials . </S>",
    "<S> a waterfall dispersion relation will result in a density of states with a peak at higher @xmath25 and a flat region on the low - frequency side of the peak , precisely as observed in our @xmath42 ) for @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our simulations suggest that the experimentally observed waterfall effect is due to the correlated in - phase vibrations of cation pairs coupled by short - range through - oxygen interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> the correlations between cation displacements show a strong dependence on the identity of the atoms . for low @xmath25 , high intensity of in - phase vibrational correlation </S>",
    "<S> is favored by nb and is disfavored by mg , with ti intermediate . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly pronounced for the pb-@xmath19-cation @xmath8 where the pb - mg @xmath8 shows weaker changes with temperature for the short @xmath9=3.5    ( 111 ) peak ( see in supplementary information ) , in contrast to all other atom pairs at @xmath44  ( including mg - mg ) . </S>",
    "<S> previous bvmd simulations have found that mg atoms and nb atoms surrounded by mg atoms ( nb@xmath45 ) exhibit fast arrhenius dynamics typical of the high - temperature paraelectric phase even for @xmath46 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite since mg - mg , mg - nb and mg - ti @xmath8 all exhibit the intensity at low @xmath25 associated with relaxor behavior , we assign the lack of pb - mg coupling as the cause of the paraelectric - like dynamics of the mg and nb@xmath45 atoms .    </S>",
    "<S> the current understanding of the relaxor transitions is that at @xmath3 small and dynamic spherical pnr form within a paraelectric matrix ; as @xmath5 is lowered , the pnr grow , show smaller polarization fluctuations , and start to freeze in at @xmath7 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite at @xmath6 , a percolation transition takes place as all of the pnr coalesce into a a single cluster resulting in the freezing of the local polarizations .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the static relaxor state is described as inhomogeneous and consisting of static pnr in a statically non - polar matrix , with volume fraction of the pnr of about 0.3 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    our results cast doubts on the conventional picture of relaxor structure and dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> recent md simulations have shown that structural and dielectric properties of pmn - pt can be reproduced without pnr .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite relaxor behavior in pb - based perovskites was also shown to be controlled by local structure parameters .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in this work , we find that the average magnitude of local cation displacements is quite large at @xmath47=375  k , with @xmath48 magnitude of @xmath110.40   , close to that found in the prototypical normal ferroelectric pbtio@xmath2 . in ferroelectric perovskites , </S>",
    "<S> uncorrelated displacements incur a large energy cost due to oxygen atom under- and overbonding , increased @xmath49-@xmath19 cation repulsion , and unfavorable dipole - dipole interactions .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite therefore , a large magnitude of local polarization requires strong correlated displacements , as found in our simulations of pmn - pt ; this is inconsistent with the idea that most of the material exists in a non - polar matrix state . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we find that correlations between the cation displacements are highly anisotropic and are weak for ( 110 ) and ( 111 ) directions even at temperatures close to @xmath6 ; this is inconsistent with the picture of the strongly polarized spherical nanoclusters .    </S>",
    "<S> we therefore suggest a alternate model for relaxor structure and dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the transition at @xmath3 is characterized by a shift from dipole - dipole interactions to the anisotropic short - range , through - oxygen coupling along the cartesian directions . at high @xmath5 , </S>",
    "<S> the thermal energy is high enough to disrupt the through - oxygen coupling , so that dipole - dipole interactions play a dominant role in determining the dynamics of the system . at @xmath3 , the energy lowering due to correlated displacements and the decrease in oxygen atom overbonding is larger than the entropy cost of correlated displacements . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the structure changes to a network of strong , through - oxygen coupled motions along the cartesian axes . </S>",
    "<S> such a transition is similar to the changes that take place when superheated water is cooled down to room temperature , where a standard polar liquid local structure dominated by dipole - dipole interactions is transformed into a directional , highly anisotropic random h - bond network with unique structural and dynamical properties . extending an analogy suggested by pirc and blinc relating the ferroelectric phase to solids and the paraelectric phase to liquids ,  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we suggest that relaxors are analogous to hydrogen - bonded water . </S>",
    "<S> a coupling network mediated by o atoms plays the role of the h - bonds in water and preferential bonding directions lead to dynamic clusters of correlated displacements of various sizes . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that water exhibits vogel - fulcher dielectric response including some extremely slow relaxation processes due to the collective h - bond network behavior further supports this analogy .  </S>",
