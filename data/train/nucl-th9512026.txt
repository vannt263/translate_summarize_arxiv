    "in recent years considerable efforts have been devoted to the development of relativistic nuclear models , whose basis is usually a relativistic lagrangian containing nucleons and mesons@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the traditional concept of interparticle potential has proved to be quite useful in nuclear physics and rather sophisticated techniques of calculation have been developed within the hamiltonian formalism .",
    "it is clear that it would be useful to be able to reformulate the relativistic problem of interacting dirac particles in terms of pauli spinors and potentials , since this would allow one to employ the non - relativistic computational techniques .",
    "furthermore , the high energies and high momentum transfers accessible at facilities such as cebaf require calculations to be performed in regimes where the relativistic kinematics is certainly important : then , one may ask the question whether genuine relativistic dynamical effects are present and to which extent they may reconducted to a potential treatment .",
    "a possible way of connecting the two approaches relies on hamiltonians containing the nucleon relativistic kinetic energy and a potential obtained by expanding at some order in @xmath0 the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) scattering amplitude .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite the quasielastic charge response of electron scattering has been evaluated in the relativistic fermi gas model using the bonn potential expanded up to @xmath1 .",
    "a similar approach has been followed in ref .",
    "@xcite , using a relativistic hamiltonian in variational monte carlo calculations .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show how a systematic expansion of the nucleon - nucleon interaction in a many - body nuclear system can be constructed , using the well - known foldy - wouthuysen transformation .",
    "the many - body problem , expressed in terms of relativistic green s functions and meson - nucleon vertices , is transformed to an exactly equivalent one , in terms of modified green s functions and vertices .",
    "after projection on the positive energy states and expansion in powers of @xmath0 one recovers the familiar relativistic potentials .",
    "this procedure gives a systematic way of dealing with @xmath0 expansions in a many - body context : it allows one to address , for instance , the issue of _ self consistency _ , i.  e. the fact that the dirac spinors depend on the nucleon mass , which is modified by the medium . in terms of relativistic hamiltonians",
    ", this means that the potential , which affects the effective nucleon mass via the self - energy , should in turn depend on it . in a fully relativistic context",
    "this problem is rather simple to solve , whereas in a non - relativistic framework it is ill - defined .    in the following we",
    "shall not be concerned with antinucleons degrees of freedom : although this is an interesting issue in itself , we would like to maintain our initial commitment of trying to understand the nuclear phenomena including `` simple '' relativistic effects , such as kinetic energies and momentum - dependent potentials .",
    "any failure in this program might of course open the way to more interesting relativistic effects , like , e.  g. , vacuum polarization .",
    "the reader should also be aware of a potential source of inconsistency connected to retardation effects .",
    "in fact , the parameters of empirical nn potentials , such as the bonn one , have usually been fixed assuming a static interaction . although the inclusion of retardation in the formalism developed in the present paper is rather straightforward , when dealing with an empirical nn potential this may not be the most appropriate course to follow .",
    "since in the following we have applied the formalism only to hartree calculations , which are not affected by this problem , we have considered , for simplicity , static propagators for the meson fields .",
    "the issue will have to be reconsidered when dealing , e.  g. , with random phase approximation calculations .",

    "[ sec : rel - h - cal ] the hartree problem is solved , comparing the results obtained with the relativistic hamiltonians to the exact ones . finally , in the last section we present our conclusions .",
