    "in addition , interesting direct limits have been placed on the higgs boson mass and the masses of supersymmetric and other new particles@xcite . as a means to continue to address these important issues , the design of linear @xmath15 colliders with center - of - mass energies in the range 0.32.0  tev is being actively pursued worldwide@xcite . with an appropriate design , an @xmath15 collider could also be operated as an @xmath4 collider@xcite .",
    "the construction of high energy @xmath4 colliders has not been pursued in recent times .",
    "the probable reason for this lack of activity is the absence of @xmath16-channel resonance production in @xmath4 due to lepton number conservation .",
    "however , precisely because direct channel resonances are not expected , high energy @xmath4 collisions could be a clean way to uncover physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , and several new physics signals have recently been discussed@xcite .",
    "there are a number of interesting physics possibilities for an @xmath4 collider . in the context of supersymmetry",
    ", searches could be made for scalar electron and chargino pair production@xcite .",
    "for example ,",
    "the chargino production process @xmath17 with @xmath18 decays gives @xmath8 final states .",
    "searches could also be made for doubly - charged higgs bosons@xcite , doubly - charged gauge bosons@xcite or @xmath19 production@xcite .",
    "massive majorana neutrino exchange could allow @xmath20 production@xcite , although due to double @xmath21-decay constraints the cross section must be very small .",
    "tests of anomalous vector boson couplings could be made@xcite , such as the @xmath22 coupling from the @xmath23 process .",
    "in the present paper we calculate sm expectations for single and pair production of vector bosons in @xmath4 collisions which are of interest for tests of electroweak theory and as backgrounds to new physics possibilities .",
    "we calculate the associated production of a neutral higgs boson and a weak boson .",
    "we also study the possibility of detecting strong @xmath8 scattering and quantitatively evaluate the enhancement of @xmath8 production due to a doubly - charged higgs boson . at the end",
    ", we will briefly discuss the effects of beamstrahlung and bremsstrahlung on the effective center - of - mass energies and the effective luminosities of the @xmath4 colliders .",
