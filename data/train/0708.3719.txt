    "a few dozens of very young and massive stars have been found in the central parsec of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "these stars are a few million years old @xcite and lie on a disk @xcite or two disks @xcite .",
    "the disks rotate around the central black hole ( bh ) and are at large angles with each other .",
    "one disk rotates clockwise in projection , the other counterclockwise @xcite .",
    "these disks are coeval to within 1 myr .",
    "the orbit of the stars on the clockwise rotating disk are circular @xcite or eccentric have lower - limit eccentricities of @xmath1 @xcite , while those on the counterclockwise disk have high eccentricities at around 0.8 @xcite . in the central parsec , in situ formation of these stars",
    "seems difficult because of the strong tidal field of the central bh . to overcome this difficulty , two possibilities have been suggested : ( 1 ) in situ star formation in a massive accretion disk , or ( 2 ) inspiraling young star clusters .",
    "the accretion disk scenario was proposed by @xcite .",
    "a dense gaseous disk is formed from a molecular cloud which somehow fell to the neighborhood of the central bh .",
    "if the disk is sufficiently massive it can become gravitationally unstable , resulting in fragmentation and formation of stars . however , this scenario is problematic .",
    "observations have shown that two disks are at large angles with respect to each other and these stars on the disks formed almost at the same time . in this scenario ,",
    "two disks must have existed simultaneously within 1 myr .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to make stars with eccentric orbit from accretion disks @xcite .",
    "the star cluster inspiral scenario was proposed by @xcite .",
    "a star cluster was formed at a distance of tens of parsecs from the gc and spiraled into the gc due to the dynamical friction .",
    "this scenario is supported by the observational fact that two young dense star clusters , the arches and quintuplet clusters are observed at the distances of @xmath2 30 pc from the gc@xcite .",
    "although this scenario can explain two stellar disks without difficulty , numerical simulations have shown that it would take too long time for the star cluster to inspiral to the central parsec unless it was very massive or its initial position is very near from the gc ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter pz03 ; grkan & rasio 2005 ) .    in these works ( pz03 ; grkan & rasio 2005 ) , the orbit of the cluster within its parent galaxy was calculated using the dynamical friction formula @xcite . with this approach",
    ", the inspiral timescale might have been overestimated . in @xcite , we performed fully self - consistent @xmath0-body simulations of a satellite galaxy within its parent galaxy and found that the orbital decay of the satellite is much faster than those calculated analytically from the dynamical friction formula .",
    "this difference was caused by particles escaped from the satellite .",
    "one mechanism is that the direct gravitational forces from escaped particles worked as effective drag force to the satellite .",
    "the second mechanism is that escaped particles remain close to the body of the satellite and enhance the dynamical friction .",
    "these effect should also work in the case of star clusters .",
    "therefore , a fully self - consistent @xmath0-body simulation is necessary to obtain correct results for the orbital evolution of star clusters .",
    "kim & morris ( 2003 ; hereafter km03 ) performed self - consistent @xmath0-body simulations of star clusters near the gc .",
    "their results showed that if the initial central density of a star cluster was initially very high ( @xmath3pc@xmath4 ) , the cluster can deliver stars to the central parsec of the galaxy . in these simulations , however , the internal evolution of the star clusters was neglected .",
    "the stars in their model of star clusters have an equal mass and a large softening length of 0.025pc .",
    "such star clusters experience neither mass segregation nor core collapse .",
    "however , if the core collapse occurs , the core density of a star cluster increases .",
    "the initial high density of the core will not be necessary .",
    "thus , it is also important to solve the internal evolution correctly .",
    "such a fully self - consistent @xmath0-body simulation has been impossible with conventional numerical methods .",
    "while star clusters need a very accurate scheme such as the combination of fourth - order hermite scheme and direct force calculation , galaxies contain too many particles to use the direct force calculation . to solve this problem ,",
    "we have developed a new tree - direct hybrid scheme , the `` bridge '' scheme @xcite .",
    "the bridge scheme enables us to perform fully self - consistent @xmath0-body simulations of star clusters within their parent galaxies in a realistic time ( less than 2 days with a single grape-6 board ) .",
    "we performed fully self - consistent @xmath0-body simulations of evolution of star clusters within their parent galaxies using the bridge scheme .",
    "we also performed the `` traditional '' @xmath0-body simulations , in which the orbital decay of the star cluster is calculated using the dynamical friction formula for comparison .",
    "we found that the inspiral timescale of the star cluster is shorter than that obtained in previous studies .",
    "in addition , if the initial orbit of the star cluster is eccentric , the timescale of inspiral is much shorter than that for a cluster in the circular orbit of the same apocenter distance .",
    "the eccentricities of the stars escaped from the star cluster distribute around the eccentricity of the star cluster . thus ,",
    "if a star cluster is initially in an eccentric orbit , it naturally explains the rather high eccentricities of the stars in the observed `` disks '' . also , because of the mass segregation effect , very massive stars ( more than @xmath5 ) remained in the cluster and were brought very close to gc .",
    "thus , we conclude that the timescale problem with the cluster inspiral scenario was partly because of the wrong treatment of the dynamical friction and partly because the limited assumption of the circular orbit , and it is not difficult to make the central stellar disks from inspiraled star clusters .",
    "we describe the simulation method and initial conditions in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we show the results of simulations .",
    "section 4 is for summary and discussions .",
    "we adopted a king model with @xmath6 for the model of a star cluster .",
    "its core radius , @xmath7 , half - mass radius , @xmath8 , and tidal radius , @xmath9 , are 0.087 pc , 0.13 pc , and 0.47 pc , respectively .",
    "it consists of 65536 stars and we assigned each star a mass randomly drawn from a @xcite initial mass function between 0.3 and 100 @xmath10 , irrespective of position .",
    "the total mass of the star cluster , @xmath11 , is @xmath12 .",
    "this model imitates the arches cluster @xcite , whose mass and velocity dispersion are @xmath13 within 0.23 pc and 22 km s@xmath14 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the arches cluster is located at @xmath15 pc from the gc .",
    "we , however , placed our cluster much closer to the gc , to compare our result with those of pz03 . in table",
    "[ tb : models ] , we summarize the model parameters .",
    "we used two galaxy models as a model of the central region of the galaxy ; one includes the central smbh ( galaxy 1 ) and the other does not ( galaxy 2 ) . for the galaxy model 1",
    ", we adopted a king model with non - dimensional central potential of @xmath16 .",
    "we scaled the density and velocity dispersion of our model at 5 pc from the gc to the those of the galaxy .",
    "the density at 5 pc is @xmath17 and the one - dimensional velocity dispersion is 64 km s@xmath14 in our scales , while the observed density at 5 pc is @xmath18 @xcite and the observed velocity dispersion is 54 km s@xmath14at @xmath2 4 pc @xcite .",

    "the total mass of the galaxy , @xmath19 , is @xmath20 , and the core radius , @xmath21 , and the half - mass radius , @xmath22 , are 0.66 pc and 21 pc , respectively .",
    "we used @xmath23 particles to model the galaxy .",
    "the mass of a particle of the galaxy is 40 @xmath10 .",
    "since our galaxy model has the finite core size of 0.66pc , the orbital evolution of the star cluster should be reasonably accurate as far as its distance from the gc is more than 1pc .",
    "the galaxy model 2 is a more realistic model of than model 1 .",
    "it includes a central super - massive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "this model is based on king model .",
    "we put a smbh at the center of the galaxy with king model @xmath16 and integrated it for around two crossing times .",
    "the central region of the galaxy evolved and its density profile became cuspy .",
    "this model roughly represents the galactic center between 0.1 and 5 pc .",

    "the initial position and velocity of the star cluster are shown in table [ tb : initial ] .",
    "we calculated two orbits ; one is circular ( model c ) and the other is eccentric ( model e ) for the galaxy model 1 , and two eccentric orbits ( model b1 , b2 ) for the galaxy model 2 . in model b1 , the star cluster has almost the same eccentricity as the previous simulation without smbh . in model b2 ,",
    "the eccentricity of the star cluster is lower than model b1 .",
    "the orbital elements for the eccentric case were chosen so that the star cluster would survive at least for several orbits . at first",
    ", we tried the eccentric orbit with the same orbital energy as that of the circular case .",

    "this result suggests that previous studies underestimated the inspiral timescale of star clusters .",
    "this effect is not very large , but not negligible .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mass_cir ] , it seems that the mass loss in the very late stage ( after more than 80% of the initial total mass is lost ) seems to be significantly slower for the case of full @xmath0-body simulation than those for other two simulations , even though the cluster is much closer to gc .",
    "this difference is probably due to the finite core size of our galaxy model ( @xmath74 ) and not the reality . in order to study the evolution after this stage",
    ", we need to use a more realistic model of the mass distribution of the central parsec of the galaxy , which includes the central massive black hole .",
    "in addition , stellar collision and merger within the star cluster must be modeled .",
    "we are currently working on such an extension of the bridge code .",
    "figures [ fig : core_cir ] and [ fig : density_cir ] show the core radius and the core density of the star cluster .",
    "the core collapse occurred at around @xmath75 myr .",
    "the core collapse times are also the same among the three simulations .",

    "the initial distance of the star cluster from the gc is 5 pc .",
    "the star cluster is elongated and particles are stripped due to the tidal force of the galaxy .",
    "the stripped particles form complex tidal tails .",
    "figure [ fig : radius_ecc ] shows the orbital evolution of the star cluster .",
    "the orbital decay of the full @xmath0-body simulation is faster than the traditional simulations , as was the case in the runs from the circular orbit . in this case also , the evolution of the bound mass is the same among the three simulations ( see figure [ fig : mass_ecc ] ) .",
    "moreover , this result shows that variable @xmath72 works better than constant @xmath72 .",
    "figures [ fig : core_ecc ] and [ fig : density_ecc ] show the core radius and the core density of the star cluster .",
    "these show that the core collapse occurred at around @xmath76 myr .",
    "the core collapse time is almost the same as that for the case of the circular orbit , even though the bound mass at the collapse time is different by almost a factor of two .",
    "the half - mass relaxation time at the time of the collapse was 0.11 myr and 0.34 myr , in model c and e , respectively .",
    "thus , if clusters are rapidly losing its mass due to the tidal field , the apparent age measured by the present relaxation time can show large variations , even if they started from the same initial condition and collapsed at the same time .",
    "furthermore , the core collapse times are the same as that in the case without massloss due to the tidal field .",
    "the core collapse time , @xmath77 , is estimated as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is half - mass relaxation time @xcite . from this equation",
    ", we obtain the core collapse time of our model star cluster as 0.51 myr .",
    "our results agreed with it .",
    "figure [ fig : radius_bh ] - [ fig : density_bh ] shows the results of model b1 ( dashed curves ) and b2 ( dotted curves ) , where the galaxy model has a central bh .",
    "solid curves show the result of model e ( no bh ; the same as the solid curve in figure [ fig : radius_ecc ] - [ fig : density_ecc ] ) .",
    "the orbital evolution of the star cluster in model b1 and b2 is essentially similar to that in model e. however , the orbital decay in model b1 is somewhat slower than that in model e. as is clear in figure [ fig : mass_bh ] , in model b1 , the mass loss at the pericenter passage is much larger than in the case of model e. therefore , the core collapse did not occur and the core density of the cluster did not increase .",
    "this is because the star cluster suffers the strong tidal force from the smbh at the pericenter .",
    "the small mass of the star cluster slows the orbital evolution of the star cluster .",
    "furthermore , the strong tidal field disrupts the star cluster much faster than the case without smbh .    in model b2 ,",
    "the pericenter of the star cluster is farther than that in model b1 .",
    "the evolution of the bound mass is the same as the case without smbh .",
    "however , the orbital evolution is much slower than that of model b1 , because the pericenter of the star cluster is farther .",
    "the cluster model and its orbital evolutions in model e and b1 are almost the same as simulation 8 of km03 .",
    "their model of the galaxy has a power - law density profile with the central smbh , while our galaxy model 1 for model e has no smbh .",
    "however , the enclosed mass of the galaxy in km03 is very similar to ours between around 1 and 10pc . in their simulation ,",
    "the star cluster was totally disrupted before 1 myr , but in our simulation , the star cluster has 30% of its initial mass at the end of our simulation ( 0.75 myr ) .",
    "the difference is caused by the internal evolution of the star cluster . in our simulation , mass segregation and core collapse of the cluster",
    "made the central density much higher , which prevent the complete disruption of the cluster .",
    "on the other hand , in km03 , such an evolution was prevented by the numerical method they used .",
    "on the other hand , the cluster in model b1 was disrupted before the core collapse occurs by the strong tidal field of the central smbh . at around 1 pc , the enclosed mass of galaxy model 2 which includes",
    "a smbh is twice as large as that of k04 s model .",
    "such a difference of the enclosed masses is caused by the mass of the smbh .",
    "we adopted @xmath80 @xcite , while km03 did @xmath81 .",
    "thus , the presence of a smbh has considerable effect on the evolution of star clusters .",
    "the main effect is that the tidal field near the gc becomes much stronger , resulting in faster mass loss from star clusters and preventing its core collapse . in the models we tested ,",
    "the core collapse time is about the same as the time of the complete disruption in model b1 .",
    "if the core collapse time is somewhat faster , it is possible that the cluster survives and approaches to the gc .",
    "in particular , if an imbh is formed within the star cluster , it would significantly help the survival of the cluster .",
    "we will study this aspect in more details in the forthcoming papers .",
    "for some of the stars in the central parsec , the projected positions and the proper motions have been measured , and their orbital elements have been estimated @xcite .",
    "young and bright stars apparently belong to one of the two `` disks '' ( clockwise and counter - clockwise rotating disks ) , though the existence of the counter - clockwise disk is controversial @xcite .",
    "the eccentricities of the stars on the counter - clockwise rotating disk are high , @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "for the stars on the clockwise rotating disk , @xcite concluded their orbits are circular , while @xcite concluded the lower limits of their eccentricities distribute between 0.0 and 0.8 .",
    "these high eccentricities are difficult to explain with the in - situ formation scenario , and also have been thought to be difficult to explain with cluster inspiral scenario , since in both cases the stars would have close - to - circular orbits .",
    "we investigated the eccentricities , @xmath83 , and inclinations , @xmath84 , of stars escaped from the star cluster ( i.e. unbound stars ) for model c and e. figures [ fig : ei_cir ] and [ fig : ei_ecc ] show the eccentricities and inclinations of escaped stars and their evolutions for model c and e , respectively . in these figures ,",
    "the @xmath85-axis is the semi - major axis , @xmath86 , of the star .",
    "the eccentricity is defined as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the apocenter and pericenter distances , respectively .",
    "we obtained the peri- and apocenter distances by integrating the orbits of the stars in the model potential .",
    "the inclination is defined as @xmath90 , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the angular momentum and its @xmath93 component , respectively .",
    "the top panels show the eccentricities and inclinations of the stars escaped before @xmath94 myr .",
    "the central gap corresponds to the semi - major axis of the star cluster , and the left and right wings are the stars on the leading and trailing arms , respectively .",
    "the distributions of the escaped stars on the @xmath95 and @xmath96 plains expand because of the time - varying gravitational force from the star cluster ( see the middle panels ) .",
    "the bottom panels show the distribution of all escaped stars at the last snap shots , @xmath97 myr .",
    "even in the case of the circular orbit ( model c ) , the eccentricities of the escapers in innermost orbits can reach rather large values .",
    "however , in the case of the eccentric orbit ( model e ) , the eccentricities of the escapers are even higher .",
    "they distribute between 0.4 and 0.8 , being consistent with the observed values of stars in the two `` disks '' .",
    "thus , if the cluster is initially in a highly eccentric orbit , the high eccentricities of observed stars are naturally explained .",
    "figure [ fig : mf1 ] shows the evolution of the mass function ( mf ) of the stars bound to the star cluster for model c. we can see that the slope of the mass function for @xmath98 becomes flatter as the system evolves , while that for @xmath99 shows rather little change . to see this effect more clearly , in figure",
    "[ fig : mf ] we plot the fraction of the mass retained in the cluster as the function of the stellar mass for model c. stars with mass @xmath100 are almost perfectly retained in the cluster , and the retention rate quickly drops in the range of @xmath101 . for @xmath99 ,",
    "retention rate becomes smaller for smaller mass , but the dependence becomes much weaker .",
    "figure [ fig : rm ] shows the evolution of the enclosed mass in @xmath102 , the distance from the center of the star cluster for model c. the enclosed masses are calculated for five mass ranges .",
    "initially , all mass ranges have same profile . at @xmath94 myr , the most massive stars have sank to the center and the second massive stars also shows some central condensation . at @xmath103 myr ,",
    "a large fraction of stars more massive than 10 @xmath10 have sank to the center ( within radius 0.02 pc ) .",
    "however , the distribution of stars with mass less than @xmath104 have not changed significantly .",
    "thus , the stars heavier than 10 @xmath10 remained in the star cluster .    we can estimate the critical mass of the star at which this change in the behavior occurs , by calculating the mass of the star at which the dynamical friction just balances the two - body heating .",
    "first , we consider the energy change of the stars in the system consisting of two components with the masses @xmath105 and @xmath106 . assuming that the velocity dispersions of both components are maxwellian , the mean energy change of a star of mass @xmath105 is expressed as @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are mean specific kinetic energy of each components , @xmath110 is the number density of the stars of mass @xmath106 , and @xmath61 is the coulomb logarithm @xcite . at least in the initial model ,",
    "the velocity dispersion of the stars is independent of the mass .",
    "so we can set @xmath111 . in this case ,",
    "equation ( [ eq : energy1 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a constant .",
    "now we consider the case of continuous mass distribution , in which the mass distribution of @xmath106 is given by @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a constant .",
    "the number density of mass @xmath106 , @xmath110 , is expressed as @xmath116 by substituting equation ( [ eq : mf ] ) to ( [ eq : energy2 ] ) and integrating it over mass @xmath106 , we can obtain the energy change of stars with mass @xmath105 as @xmath117_{m_{\\rm min}}^{m_{\\rm max}},\\label{eq : energy3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the maximum and minimum mass of the mf and @xmath120 is a constant .",
    "if the right side of equation ( [ eq : energy3 ] ) is negative , the star with mass @xmath105 loses energy and sink to the center of the star cluster .",
    "the minimum mass with the negative energy change , @xmath121 , is expressed as @xmath122 where we defined @xmath123 and @xmath124 . using the values used for our model , @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127",
    ", we obtain @xmath128 .",
    "this value agrees well with the mass where the power - low index of the mf breaks in figure [ fig : mf ] .",
    "if @xmath129 , we obtain @xmath130 therefore , @xmath131 when @xmath132 , the value of @xmath121 varies from @xmath119 to @xmath118 .",
    "the observed mf of the stars in the central parsec is much flatter than salpeter @xcite .",
    "the cluster inspiral model rather naturally explain this flat mf , since only the most massive stars remain bound to the cluster and are carried to the central region of the galaxy .",
    "we performed fully self - consistent @xmath0-body simulations of a star cluster within its parent galaxy and compared the orbital and internal evolutions of the star cluster with those obtained by `` traditional '' simulations , in which the orbital evolution of the star cluster is calculated from the dynamical friction formula .",
    "we confirmed that the inspiral timescale of the star cluster is shorter than that obtained from the `` traditional '' simulations .",
    "furthermore , our results showed that the core collapse make the core density of the cluster increase and helps the cluster survive .",
    "we performed simulations of circular and eccentric orbits of the star cluster . in previous studies ,",
    "most of the simulations were from circular orbits ( pz03 ; grkan & rasio 2005 ) .",
    "we found that , however , eccentric orbits are more favorable to explain the distribution of stars around the gc for following reasons .",
    "first , eccentric orbits are natural , if the formation of star clusters was triggered by collisions between gas clouds .",
    "second , star clusters with eccentric orbits can approach to the gc much faster than those with circular orbits ( km03 ) .",
    "third , @xcite showed that many stars in the counterclockwise rotating disk have high eccentricities ( @xmath133 ) , while the distribution of the eccentricities of the stars in the clockwise disk is very broad .",
    "since the eccentricities of the escaped stars distribute around the eccentricity of the star cluster , the star cluster model with eccentric orbits can naturally explain the existence of high - eccentricity stars .",
    "the power - low index of the mf of the bound stars to the star cluster breaks at around 7.9 @xmath10 .",
    "stars heavier than this mass sink to the center of the star cluster due to the mass segregation .",
    "since the tidal stripping removes the stars outside of the star cluster , the massive stars selectively remain in the star cluster . as a result",
    ", the star cluster carries only massive stars to the gc .",
    "the star cluster scenario can reproduce the flat mf in the central parsec , without the need for nonstandard initial mass function .",
    "first , we showed the orbits of star clusters decays faster in full @xmath0-body simulations than in `` traditional '' simulations , which treat the dynamical friction analytically using a king model @xmath134 as a model of the central region of the galaxy .",
    "the model is sufficient for such comparisons , but not for more realistic comparison between our model and the stars in the gc because within @xmath21 pc the mass density of our model is much lower than that of the actual galaxy .",
    "next , we showed the case of more realistic galaxy model with a central bh .",
    "the orbital evolution was similar that in the model without a bh . for the comparison between our simulations and the actual stars , however , we need more simulations in various initial conditions . we will report more detail result of runs with the central smbh in forthcoming papers .      irs 13e consists of seven stars within a projected diameter of @xmath2 0.02 pc and is located at @xmath2 0.14 pc in projection from the gc and these stars have very similar proper motions @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that irs 13e is the remnant core of a star cluster that have fallen to the gc and dissolved there and that the members of irs 13e are bound by a central imbh . from the analysis of proper motions",
    ", the minimum mass of the imbh was estimated as 1300 @xmath10 @xcite - @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "in this paper we simulated the evolution of star clusters only before the core collapse because of the limitation of our present code .",
    "our code currently can not treat the post - collapse evolution since we use the softened potential .",
    "collisions and mergers between stars would have occurred and an imbh would have be formed , if our code can handle these events .",
    "the star cluster inspiral scenario might reveal the origin of the irs 13e . we are currently working to implement collisions and mergers .",
    "the result will be reported in the future papers .",
