    "nearby star forming regions display a continuum of properties , ranging from isolated young stellar objects and loose `` aggregates '' @xcite to dense clusters containing hundreds if not thousands of stars within parsec sized regions @xcite .",
    "the diverse range of observed stellar environments reflect the various physical processes that initiate star formation over the lifetime of molecular clouds . in principle , the predominant mechanisms that lead to star formation can be inferred by reconstructing the star formation rate in molecular clouds as a function of time and stellar mass . while a comprehensive picture of how star formation evolves in time",
    "requires obtaining masses and ages for the individual stars that have formed within a cloud , constraints on the star formation history can nonetheless be obtained from a census of the embedded stellar population to establish the number of stars that have formed and where in the cloud they tend to be located .",
    "the stellar population associated with a cloud is most often identified using large scale surveys for an emission feature commonly associated with pre - main - sequence stars , such as far - infrared emission ( e.g. beichman et  al .",
    "1986 ) , near - infrared excesses ( e.g. cambrsy et  al .",
    "1998 ) , h@xmath4 ( e.g. nakano , wiramihardja , & kogure  1995 ) , or x - rays ( e.g. walter et  al .  1988 ) .",
    "while such studies generally produce reliable catalogs of young stellar objects , they may not provide a complete census of the stellar population in molecular clouds .",
    "surveys for far - infrared emission , near - infrared excesses , and h@xmath4 in particular generally detect pre - main - sequence objects surrounded by an optically thick circumstellar disk or envelope .",
    "the evolution of circumstellar material as a function of stellar age and mass remains poorly quantified , which makes it difficult to infer the extent of the stellar population not currently in this phase of stellar evolution and not detectable by these diagnostics . indeed , x - ray observations , which probe stellar chromospheric activity and",
    "can readily detect stars as old as @xmath1100  myr in nearby ( @xmath5200  pc ) star forming regions , have detected a widespread population of objects in and around molecular clouds .",
    "the interpretation of the x - ray results remain controversial , though , as the spatially extended x - ray population may represent older pre - main - sequence stars that have dispersed from molecular clouds , stars that formed in surrounding cloudlets @xcite , or young main sequence stars that have formed in the solar neighborhood in the past 100  myr @xcite .",
    "furthermore , x - ray observations in the pre - chandra era lack the required combination of sensitivity , coverage , and angular resolution to provide an accurate census of the stellar population contained in both isolated star forming regions and dense clusters over entire molecular clouds .",
    "an alternative approach to infer the underlying stellar population in molecular clouds is to statistically determine the excess number of stars observed toward the cloud relative to the expected field star contribution .",
    "such star count techniques are best suited for molecular clouds located at high galactic latitudes where the field star contamination is less severe , and for near - infrared wavelength surveys where embedded stars are more readily detected .",
    "while near - infrared star count analyses have the obvious limitation that individual young stellar objects can not be uniquely identified for further study , they represent a powerful probe of the stellar population in that near - infrared emission generally originates from the stellar photosphere ( except for the heavily accreting objects ) .",
    "the intrinsic brightness of a star then depends foremost on the stellar mass ( and age for pre - main - sequence objects ) , and the parameter space probed by a set of observations can be estimated with the aid of pre - main - sequence evolutionary models .",
    "further , current observations are generally sensitive to stars spanning a broad range of masses and ages , including objects in nearby molecular clouds with masses below the hydrogen burning limit , and have the angular resolution needed to resolve many of the stars in dense clusters .",
    "thus near - infrared star count studies have the potential obtain a more unbiased census of the embedded stellar population in molecular clouds .",
    "the first extensive near - infrared observations to statistically characterize the spatial distribution of young stars in a molecular cloud was the @xmath6   band survey of orion  b ( l1630 ) by lada et  al .",
    "( 1991 ; see also li , evans , & lada  1997 ) .",
    "surveys of other regions with similar aims have since been conducted for orion  a ( l1641 ; strom , strom , & merrill  1993 ) , ngc2264 @xcite , the rosette @xcite , ngc1333 @xcite , and ophiuchus @xcite among others ( see recent reviews by allen & hillenbrand  2000 ; meyer & lada  2000 ; clarke , bonnell , & hillenbrand  2000 ) .",
    "a synthesis of these results suggest that more than half of the stellar population in molecular clouds is contained in clusters with various sizes and densities @xcite .",
    "however , most near - infrared observations to date cover only a fraction of the total cloud area and nearly all have been predisposed toward regions within clouds known _ a priori _ to contain prominent star formation activity ( and likely clusters ) . thus current near - infrared observations do not accurately characterize the spatial distribution of stars over entire molecular clouds .",
    "the 2 micron all sky survey ( _ 2mass _ ) removes many of the limitations of prior observations and has provided the first sensitive , uniformly calibrated @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9  near - infrared survey over entire molecular clouds . in this paper",
    ", we analyze data from the _",
    "2mass _  second incremental release to investigate the spatial distribution of young stars in the perseus , orion  a , orion  b , and monoceros r2 ( monr2 ) molecular clouds in order to determine the relative importance of cluster and isolated stellar systems .",
    "these clouds were chosen for this study since they are nearby with distances less than 1  kpc to maximum sensitivity to the low mass stellar population , are located at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath10 ) to minimize field star contamination , and have available @xmath11co  maps that are required for the analysis presented here .",
    "the results from this study are presented as follows . in section  [ data ] , we review the characteristics of the _ 2mass _  data and select a subset of the point source catalog for analysis . in section  [ analysis ] , the near - infrared star counts toward the perseus , orion  a , orion  b , and monr2 molecular clouds are used to identify any cluster and distributed stellar populations .",
    "the implications of these results for the star formation history of molecular clouds is discussed in section  [ discussion ] , and the conclusions are summarized in section  [ summary ] .",
    "the near - infrared data analyzed in this study were obtained from the _ 2mass_second incremental data release .",
    "the observational goal of _ 2mass _  is to survey @xmath395% of the sky simultaneously in the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9  bands .",
    "the data are obtained by scanning a series of @xmath12  long tiles aligned in declination . each position in a tile is observed first with a short , 51  msec integration to recover photometry for bright stars ( between @xmath1 5 - 8@xmath13 ) , and then with a relatively long , 1.3  sec integration for deeper photometry .",
    "adjacent images within a tile overlap such that each position on the sky is nominally observed 6 times .",
    "the pixel scale of the observations is 2 , but since overlapping images within a tile are designed to subsample the raw camera pixels , the coadded images produced in data reduction from the long integration frames have a pixel scale of 1 .",
    "the _ 2mass _   second incremental release point source catalog contains a list of positions and magnitudes for point sources in @xmath147% of the sky that have a photometric uncertainty @xmath14 0.155@xmath13  ( i.e. a signal to noise ratio @xmath15 ) in at least one of the three observed bands .",
    "this study analyzes a subset of the catalog that includes the perseus , orion  a , orion  b , and monr2 molecular clouds . at the time of the second incremental release , _",
    "2mass _  data are available for the entire area of the monr2 and orion  a molecular clouds , @xmath180% of perseus , and @xmath170% of orion  b. the galactic coordinates of these clouds and their adopted distances are summarized in table  [ tbl : clouds ] .    the _",
    "2mass _  point source data need to be analyzed at magnitude limits bright enough to ensure uniform completeness across the region studied .",
    "the magnitude thresholds for the three bands were set by computing as a function of magnitude the average signal to noise ratio and the fraction of stars that have a signal to noise ratio @xmath16 10 for point sources between galactic longitudes of 130  and 250  and galactic latitudes of -50  and + 50 . based on this analysis , the faint magnitudes thresholds for analyzing the star counts",
    "were set at 15.8@xmath13 , 14.9@xmath13 , and 14.3@xmath13  at @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9  band respectively . at these thresholds",
    ", the average signal to noise for the point sources is between 14 - 15 , and greater than 99% , 99% , and 97% of the sources at these magnitude limits have a photometric uncertainty corresponding to a signal to noise ratio @xmath16 10 .",
    "stars brighter than @xmath15@xmath13  are saturated even in the short integration data , and as a conservative limit , it was required that stars be fainter than 6.0@xmath13  in the appropriate band to be included in the analysis . at the galactic coordinates of the clouds studied here , the average source densities at the faint magnitude thresholds are @xmath52arcmin@xmath0 , which implies a typical source separation of @xmath1740 .",
    "thus source identification will only be confusion limited in the densest clusters which can have substantially higher surface densities than these average values .",
    "individual survey tiles may have poorer sensitivity than the adopted magnitude thresholds if spatial structure in the sky background from airglow emission added substantially to the sky noise ( especially at @xmath8  band ) at the time of the observation or if the sky background was much higher than average ( especially at @xmath9  band ) .",
    "data adversely affected by airglow were identified and removed in the present analysis by finding all tiles in the second incremental release scan database in which the observed sky noise was 20% higher than the expected noise computed from the sky background level . the percentage of the total number of tiles ( @xmath19400 total ) removed due to this criteria amounted to 0% , 8% , 0.1% at @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9  band respectively . to remove lower sensitivity data because of a high sky background level ,",
    "tiles in which the average signal to noise ratio is less than 10.0 at the adopted magnitude thresholds were also discarded .",
    "the percentage of tiles removed by this criteria were 0.14% , 0.07% , and 0.25% at @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9  band .",
    "finally , some point sources identified around bright stars ( @xmath18 @xmath5 9.5@xmath13 ) were omitted when drafting the second incremental release catalogs so that image artifacts from bright objects would not reduce the data reliability .",
    "the masked areas are primarily due to diffraction spikes and circular regions centered on bright saturated stars .",
    "the dimensions of these masks depend on the magnitude of the bright star and effectively create holes in the star count maps . using the quantitative description of these masks provided in the",
    "_ 2mass _  explanatory supplement , the fraction of each pixel in the star count map that has been partially or completely masked was computed as a function of magnitude and was used to correct the star counts maps on a pixel by pixel basis .",
    "a @xmath9  band stellar surface density map for the area between galactic longitudes of 130  and 250  and galactic latitudes of @xmath19  and @xmath20  is shown in figure  [ ksqrt ] .",
    "the surface density map was generated by binning stars with @xmath9  band magnitudes between 6.0@xmath13  and 14.3@xmath13  in @xmath21 cells .",
    "the galactic plane is clearly visible as a band of stars extending across the center of the image .",
    "the location of the perseus , orion a , orion b , and monr2 molecular clouds are labeled in figure  [ ksqrt ] , but because of the low @xmath9  band extinction , the outline of the clouds are only faintly seen in absorption against the backdrop of field stars . to gain a better perspective on the location of various molecular clouds ,",
    "figure  [ jk ] presents a map of the average @xmath22   stellar color for the same region shown in figure  [ ksqrt ] .",
    "large @xmath22   colors , represented by darker gray scales in figure  [ jk ] , are attributed to background field stars and embedded young stellar objects reddened by dust associated with molecular clouds . the taurus , perseus , orion  a , orion  b , and monr2 molecular clouds are clearly visible in figure  [ jk ] , as well as numerous clouds in the galactic plane .",
    "the outline of the clouds agree well with that inferred from optical star counts @xcite and far - infrared emission @xcite .",
    "the observed star counts toward a molecular cloud consist of unreddened foreground field stars , background field stars reddened by dust within the cloud , and young stars associated with the cloud itself .",
    "the spatial distribution of young stars in the cloud can then be obtained by removing the field stars from the star count map .",
    "ideally one would like to specifically identify the individual young stars so that they can be furthered studied .",
    "however , near - infrared photometry alone can not uniquely distinguish field stars from the stellar population associated with the cloud .",
    "stars with relatively blue near - infrared colors can either be foreground field stars , background field stars appearing through holes in the cloud , or young stars on the surface of the cloud .",
    "similarly , red stars can either be background reddened field stars or pre - main - sequence objects embedded in the cloud .",
    "the degeneracy between the field and embedded stellar population can be only partially reduced by considering both the magnitudes and colors .",
    "therefore , instead of attempting to uniquely identify which stars are associated with the cloud , the embedded stellar population was inferred statistically by first constructing a semi - empirical model of the expected field star surface density toward the cloud , and then subtracting the field star model from the observed stellar surface density map . in principle , the star count analysis can be done by simultaneously analyzing the five observable quantities for each star ( i.e. galactic longitude and latitude and the observed @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9  band magnitudes ) . in the analysis conducted here",
    ", the three near - infrared bands are analyzed separately to determine if each band provides a consistent picture of the embedded stellar population .",
    "the following sections describe how the semi - empirical field star model was generated using _",
    "2mass _  observations of regions away from the molecular clouds and published @xmath11co(10 )  maps as a tracer of the cloud extinction .",
    "the field star subtracted stellar surface density map is then used to identify stellar clusters and any stars distributed more uniformly throughout the molecular cloud .",
    "the expected number of field stars toward the molecular clouds in the absence of extinction from the cloud itself was estimated using _",
    "2mass _  observations of regions outside the molecular cloud boundaries .",
    "this was accomplished by fitting legendre polynomials as a function of galactic longitude and latitude to @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9  surface density maps for the region between @xmath23  to 240  and @xmath24  to @xmath25  binned in @xmath21 cells ( see figure  [ ksqrt ] ) .",
    "this bin size was chosen so that large scale gradients in the field star counts are well resolved while maintaining a manageable image size .",
    "a global fit was performed to the large scale surface density maps as opposed to fitting a localized region around each cloud since several blocks of _ 2mass _  tiles were not available at the time of this study , especially near the orion  b molecular cloud . without these tiles ,",
    "a localized polynomial fit is poorly constrained near the cloud boundaries .",
    "lines of sight in the surface density map that pass through an obvious stellar cluster ( see figure  [ ksqrt ] ) or that intercept a molecular cloud as traced by molecular emission @xcite or red @xmath22  colors ( see figure  [ jk ] ) were excluded from the fit .",
    "at least a 0.5  border around each cloud was also excluded which prevented any potential young stars surrounding the clouds from influencing the polynomial fit .",
    "the remaining @xmath1180,000 pixels in each surface density map were then fitted with legendre polynomials .",
    "the order of the polynomial fit was increased until the systematics in the residuals as a function of position were no longer evident .",
    "a seventh order polynomial fit in both longitude and latitude were ultimately used .",
    "the results from the polynomial fit are examined in figure  [ fit ] , which shows as a function of galactic latitude the observed mean stellar surface density , the mean residuals after subtracting the polynomial fit , and the rms in the residuals for each band .",
    "the rms of the residuals varies between @xmath1 0.1 - 0.3arcmin@xmath0  depending on the band and the galactic latitude , and is consistent with that expected from poisson statistics within the @xmath21 bin sizes .",
    "the polynomial fit described above was interpolated to yield the expected surface density of field stars as a function of galactic longitude and latitude toward the molecular clouds in the absence of extinction from the cloud itself .",
    "the uncertainties associated with interpolating the polynomial fit were assessed by performing a similar fit to star counts at the same galactic longitude but at positive latitudes where are there essentially no clouds ( see figure  [ jk ] ) .",
    "the molecular clouds masks used in fitting the star counts at negative latitude were also used at positive latitudes in in order to preserve the geometry and number of masked regions .",
    "the accuracy of the interpolated polynomial fit was assessed by subtracting the fit from the observed star counts in the masked regions and computing the rms of the residuals in areas 6  deg@xmath26 in size , which is a typical area of the larger clouds analyzed here .",
    "it was found that the average difference over this sized region between the interpolated fit and the observed star counts is @xmath50.003arcmin@xmath0  in each band with a rms deviation of @xmath1 0.002arcmin@xmath0 .",
    "dust within the molecular clouds obscures background field stars and depresses the total field star counts relative to the interpolated polynomial fit .",
    "the number of field stars that are obscured depends on the extinction along the line of sight and the frequency distribution of magnitudes for the background field star population , as foreground field stars will not be further reddened by the cloud .",
    "the extinction as a function of position through the molecular clouds was estimated using published @xmath11co  maps of the monr2 , orion  a , orion  b , and perseus molecular clouds kindly provided by j. bally ( see padoan et  al .  1999 ; miesch & bally  1994 ; bally et  al .",
    "these maps have a full - width - at - half - maximum beam size of 100  with a sampling of 60 .",
    "while the molecular gas will contain substructure within the 100@xmath27 beam , these maps resolve the large scale structural features present in these clouds and should accurately trace the global spatial distribution of extinction .",
    "assuming that the @xmath11co(10 )  emission is optically thin and in local thermodynamic equilibrium , the @xmath11co  column density can be estimated from the j=1 - 0 integrated intensity using the formula @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the excitation temperature and @xmath30 the integrated @xmath11co(10 )  intensity .",
    "the derived @xmath11co  column densities will be in error by less than a factor of 2 by assuming @xmath29=10  k as long as the actual excitation temperature is less than 30  k. such high excitation temperatures are expected only toward the embedded ob stars which occupy a small fraction of the total cloud area in any of these regions .",
    "the @xmath11cocolumns densities can be converted into visual extinctions using the empirical @xmath31@xmath32 correlations that has been observed in many clouds @xcite .",
    "these studies have shown that the ratio of @xmath31 to @xmath32 is typically within the range of @xmath1@xmath33  cm@xmath0  mag@xmath35  and that @xmath11co  is detectable only when the visual extinction reaches a threshold value of @xmath10.5 - 1.5 magnitude due to photodissociation of the molecules at low column densities @xcite . to determine the sensitivity of the field star model on the derived extinctions , three different set of assumptions were adopted to convert the @xmath11co  column densities into visual extinctions .",
    "the `` nominal '' extinction model assumes a @xmath36 ratio of @xmath37  cm@xmath0  mag@xmath35  as derived by @xcite and that the extinction needed to detect @xmath11co(10 )  is @xmath38@xmath13 .",
    "this calibration was adopted since it has the best statistical accuracy among published observations and the parameters are in the middle of values generally observed in molecular clouds .",
    "similarly , a `` low '' extinction model was derived by assuming a @xmath36 ratio of @xmath39  cm@xmath0  mag@xmath35  and a visual extinction threshold of 0.5@xmath13 , and a `` high '' extinction model was obtained by assuming a @xmath31/@xmath32 ratio of @xmath40  cm@xmath0  mag@xmath35  and a visual extinction threshold of 1.5@xmath13 .",
    "the low and high extinction models adopt parameters at the extrema of the observed values and are assumed to represent the plausible range of visual extinction and are not formal 1@xmath41 confidence intervals .",
    "the masses of the clouds under these three extinction assumptions are summarized in table  [ tbl : clouds ] .",
    "the observed correlation between @xmath11co  column density and visual extinction is valid for @xmath42@xmath13  @xcite . for @xmath32 @xmath1710@xmath13 , the @xmath11co(10 )",
    "emission is saturated and is not a reliable tracer of the extinction .",
    "the @xmath11co  maps used here have a 3@xmath41 detection level corresponding to a visual extinction of @xmath10.2@xmath13  ( not including the visual extinction threshold ) for the nominal extinction model .",
    "the fraction of the perseus , orion  a , orion  b , and monr2 cloud area with an inferred visual extinction @xmath14 5@xmath13  is 95% , 88% , 92% , and 98% respectively .",
    "therefore , @xmath11co(10 )   emission should accurately trace the extinction over nearly the entire cloud area .",
    "the last step in constructing the field star model is to estimate the fraction of background field stars that become obscured by dust within the molecular clouds .",
    "this fraction was estimated using the extinction maps described above and the @xcite galactic star count model .",
    "this model agrees with the observed star counts to within 15% for high galactic latitude regions ( @xmath43 ) that do not contain additional reddening along the line of sight from molecular clouds . since perseus , orion  a , orion  b , and monr2 are all located at galactic latitudes between @xmath44  and @xmath45",
    ", we expect that this model should provide an accurate estimate of the fraction of field stars that are foreground to the molecular clouds .",
    "the @xcite model predicts that the fraction of the total field star counts contributed by foreground field stars ranges from 0.05 - 0.08 in perseus to 0.2 - 0.4 in monr2 in the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9  bands .",
    "the predicted absolute level of the foreground field star contamination is between 0.04arcmin@xmath0   ( perseus ) and @xmath50.3arcmin@xmath0  ( monr2 ) .    for each line of sight toward the molecular clouds with a @xmath11co(10 )  detection , the expected number of field stars were computed using the wainscoat star model with and without the @xmath11co  derived extinction added at the appropriate cloud distance .",
    "the fraction of the field star population in this model that are reddened to magnitudes outside the adopted thresholds ( see section  [ data ] ) was then computed , and the expected field star contribution inferred from the polynomial fits was reduced by the same fraction for that line of sight .",
    "thus the total number of unreddened field stars is still determined by _ 2mass _  observations , and only the relative fraction of field stars obscured by extinction from dust in molecular clouds is model dependent . in performing the calculations",
    ", we adopted the interstellar reddening vector from @xcite and the cloud distances summarized in table  [ tbl : clouds ] .",
    "uncertainties in the molecular cloud distances and the three dimensional structure of the clouds contribute to uncertainties in the field star model since extinction from the molecular cloud is applied only to the background field stars .",
    "the distance dependent uncertainties on the field star subtraction were quantified using the @xcite star count model . adopting an average visual extinction of 3@xmath13",
    "as implied by the @xmath11co  maps , the @xmath6 band field star surface density computed from the wainscoat model will vary by @xmath1@xmath46 0.002arcmin@xmath0  for perseus , @xmath46 0.004arcmin@xmath0  for orion  a and orion  b , and @xmath46 0.014arcmin@xmath0  for monr2 by changing the cloud distance by @xmath46 20% from the nominal assumed value .",
    "the corresponding uncertainties at @xmath7  and @xmath8  bands are higher by a factor of @xmath12 - 3 .",
    "the uncertainties are largest for monr2 since it is the most distant cloud analyzed here and the foreground field stars contain a greater fraction of the total field star counts than toward perseus , orion  a , or orion  b. in addition , since molecular clouds are three dimensional structures , there may be systematic variations in the distances to different parts of the cloud .",
    "for the orion molecular clouds in particular , @xcite argue that the near edge of the orion  a and orion  b molecular clouds is at a distance of @xmath1320pc , and the far edge is at a distance of @xmath1500pc .",
    "the difference in the field star model between these two distances for a visual extinction of 3@xmath13  is @xmath1 0.006arcmin@xmath0 .",
    "the stellar population associated with the cloud can be inferred by subtracting the field star model from the observed star counts . instead of using the binned star count maps that were produced for the field star polynomial fit , ( e.g. figure  [ ksqrt ] ) ,",
    "stellar surface density maps were re - generated for the molecular clouds from the observed star counts using adaptive kernel density estimation @xcite . in this method ,",
    "each star is represented by a kernel function , such as a gaussian , where the width of the kernel depends on the local stellar density as described below .",
    "the sum of the individual kernel functions yields the stellar density map for the cloud .",
    "the advantage of adaptive kernel density estimation compared to a fixed kernel size or a binned star count map is that the resolution of the map varies with the local stellar density which enables compact clusters to be more readily identified .",
    "the kernel width for each star was computed using the procedure outlined in @xcite .",
    "first , a pilot stellar density map , @xmath47 , was constructed using the standard kernel density estimate as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the bandwidth that controls the amount of smoothing , @xmath6 is the kernel function , and @xmath50 is the number of stars .",
    "the results are not sensitive to the choice of the kernel function , and a radially symmetric gaussian kernel was adopted such that @xmath51 for the pilot density estimate , the bandwidth , @xmath49 , was fixed at the angular size corresponding to 0.25  pc in anticipation that clusters and their associated dense molecular cores have typical sizes of @xmath11pc . a local bandwidth , @xmath52 , was then computed for each star as @xmath53^{-\\alpha},\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the geometric mean of @xmath55 . following @xcite ,",
    "@xmath4 was set to be 0.5 .",
    "thus in regions of low stellar surface density such that @xmath56 is small , the local bandwidth , @xmath57 , is relatively large and the data are heavily smoothed .",
    "conversely , in regions of high density such that @xmath58 is large , @xmath57 is relatively small and the data are smoothed less . the adaptive kernel density estimate was then computed as @xmath59 as for the pilot density estimate , the bandwidth , @xmath49 , was chosen to be 0.25  pc . the expected number of field stars for each pixel in the map ( see section  [ model ] )",

    "the signature of a distributed population is a positive average stellar surface density toward lines of sight outside the cluster boundaries but within the molecular cloud after subtracting the field star contribution to the observed star counts .",

    "the number of lines of sight with a negative surface density and the width of the histograms in figures  [ perseus_hist]-[monr2_hist ] depend on the kernel size used to generate the surface density maps and the surface density of the field star population . since the nominal kernel width is set to a constant linear size of 0.25pc , the angular size of the kernel will be smallest for the more distant cloud , monr2 , and largest for the nearest cloud , perseus .",
    "the perseus star count map will then be more heavily smoothed and have smaller fluctuations in the observed star counts about the model field star population than monr2 , as observed .    the mean surface density of the distributed population was obtained by averaging the field star subtracted surface density map for regions outside the cluster boundaries but within the @xmath11co  map area as represented graphically by the hatched histograms in figures  [ perseus_hist]-[monr2_hist ] .",

    "the formal 1@xmath41 uncertainties in the mean stellar surface densities computed from the distribution of points in the hatched histogram are @xmath10.005arcmin@xmath0  in each band for perseus , orion  a , and orion  b , and @xmath10.009arcmin@xmath0  for monr2 . by comparison ,",

    "thus compared to the other field star model uncertainties discussed in section  [ model ] , the largest source of uncertainty in the mean stellar surface density for the distributed population is converting the @xmath11co  integrated intensity to visual extinction .    the range of possible surface densities for the distributed population from the three extinction models is shown graphically in figures  [ perseus_cuts]-[monr2_cuts ] .",

    "this has been in fact done for the orion  a and orion  b molecular clouds , but the results remain inconclusive . both h@xmath4 @xcite and x - ray @xcite surveys of this region find a source density of @xmath11  star  deg@xmath0 in regions surrounding the orion molecular clouds and ob association .",
    "up to one - third of the x - ray sources may be unrelated foreground stars @xcite perhaps related to gould s belt @xcite , but in any event , the surface density of sources is too low to contribute significantly to the total population in the orion  a and orion  b molecular clouds relative to the clusters .",
    "h@xmath4 emission is likely not sensitive to the majority of the older stars likely to constitute a old dispersed population , though , and at the distance of the orion clouds , the rosat all sky survey is able to detect only to the more luminous x - ray t tauri stars @xcite . in more nearby clouds , however , follow up studies of the widely distributed rosat x - ray sources indicate that many these objects likely do not represent a dispersed population , but rather solar - type zero age main sequence stars or older pre - main - sequence stars unrelated to the existing molecular clouds ( magazz et  al.1997 ; see also briceo et  al .",
    "1997 , favata , micela , & sciortino 1997 ) .",
    "further , a large scale x - ray and objective - prism survey of taurus failed to find any new t tauri stars older than 5  myr @xcite .",
    "if most of the stars that have formed over the lifetime of the perseus , orion  a , orion  b , and monr2 molecular clouds are still associated with the molecular gas , then the high fraction of the total stellar population contained in clusters implies that either the star formation rate is currently higher than it has been in the past @xcite , or that molecular clouds have relatively young ages @xcite . @xcite",
    "re - analyzed published hr diagrams for a number of nearby star forming regions with a single set of pre - main - sequence models and argued that star formation over entire molecular clouds ( e.g. taurus and chamaeleon  i ) and individual clusters ( e.g. the orion nebula cluster ) started at a low rate @xmath17 10  myr ago and has increased dramatically within the past 1 - 3  myr . in their scenario ,",
    "molecular clouds remain relatively dormant for much of their cloud lifetime since individual dense cores are supported against gravitational collapse by magnetic fields , and the time scale to dissipate the magnetic support is on the order of @xmath110  myr ( see also palla & galli  1997 ) .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , suggested that the lack of old stars in taurus this is a consequence of the molecular filaments that make up the cloud having formed only within the past few million years in turbulent flows in the interstellar medium . in this scenario , taurus is an intrinsically young cloud that has not had time to form old stars ( see also elmegreen  2000 ) .",
    "the difference between the two pictures for the evolution of molecular clouds has important consequences for molecular cloud evolution . in the @xcite scenario ,",
    "molecular clouds are in a quasi - static state for most of their lifetime , while the @xcite model suggest clouds form and evolve dynamically in the interstellar medium .",
    "if the @xcite model is correct , most molecular clouds should not contain a substantial stellar population since they are relatively dormant for most of their cloud lifetimes .",
    "the difficulty with this scenario is that it would imply that we are observing a number of molecular clouds in the solar neighborhood just as they are forming a substantial fraction of their total stellar population in young clusters .",
    "this would include not only the 4 molecular clouds studied here , but also chamaeleon  i , lupus , and taurus .",
    "this is not necessarily an observational bias in that these clouds are frequently studied because they have active star formation , as star formation and stellar clusters appear to be ubiquitous in molecular clouds .",
    "more than half of the clouds within 200  pc of the sun are forming an appreciable number of t tauri stars ( feigelson  1996 and references therein ) , and most giant molecular clouds within 3  kpc of the sun are forming ob stars and presumably an accompanied clusters of lower mass stars @xcite . in this respect , imposing a short lifetime for molecular clouds would qualitatively account for the lack of a substantial older stellar population in molecular clouds without the need to impose a higher than average star formation rate at the current time @xcite .",
    "a more systematic survey of a volume limited sample of molecular clouds seems warranted though to better establish the frequency of clusters within molecular clouds as a more comprehensive observational test of these two pictures of cloud evolution .",
    "we investigate the spatial distribution of young stars associated with the perseus , orion  a , orion  b , and monr2 molecular clouds using @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9  star counts from the _",
    "2mass _  second incremental release .",
    "the stellar population associated within these clouds is determined statistically by subtracting a semi - empirical model for the field star contamination from the observed stellar surface density maps .",
    "the field star model is constructed using _",
    "2mass _  observations of the regions surrounding the clouds to measure the total field star surface density , published @xmath11co(10 )  maps to determine the cloud extinction , and the @xcite galactic star count model to estimate the fraction of field stars that are background to the clouds .",
    "the stellar population is categorized into compact stellar clusters and a distributed stellar population .",
    "individual stellar clusters are identified as peaks in the field star subtracted , stellar surface density maps , and the distributed stellar population is defined as any excess star counts outside the cluster boundaries but within the molecular cloud as traced by @xmath11co(10 )  emission .    the number of clusters within the studied molecular clouds , including clusters identified in the literature in regions not yet observed with _",
    "2mass _ , varies from 2 in perseus to 7 in orion  a. the total number of stars contained within the clusters is @xmath3393 in perseus , @xmath31992 in orion  a , 606 in orion  b , and 543 in monr2 .",
    "more than half of the cluster members in each cloud is contained in just a single rich cluster .",
    "a distributed stellar population is detected in the orion  a and monr2 molecular clouds within the uncertainties of the fieldstar subtraction at a @xmath9  band surface density between 0.013arcmin@xmath0  and 0.084arcmin@xmath0 .",
    "model calculations suggest , however , that the surface density of the distributed population in the clouds may be underestimated by as much as a factor of three if the stars have been forming with a miller - scalo initial mass function between 0.08m@xmath66  and 10m@xmath66  at a constant star formation rate for up to 100  myr . after taking into consideration the possible evolutionary status of the distributed population ,",
    "the star formation efficiencies implied by the sum of cluster and distributed populations varies between @xmath11 - 9% for the four clouds .",
    "the percentage of the total observed stellar population contained in clusters alone is 80% , 73% , 100% , and 56% for perseus , orion  a , orion  b , and monr2 respectively for the nominal extinction model , but may be up to a factor of two lower depending again on the age of the distributed population .",
    "nonetheless , the high fraction of stars currently contained in clusters is surprising given that embedded clusters typically have ages ( @xmath52  myr ) that are substantially younger than that often assumed for molecular clouds ( 10 - 100  myr ) .",
    "these results indicate that either each of these molecular clouds have been forming stars at a higher rate in the last couple of million years than in the prior history , or that the ages of molecular clouds are younger than generally assumed .",
    "jmc would like to thank lynne hillenbrand for numerous discussions and comments on this work .",
    "he is also grateful to john bally for providing the @xmath11co  molecular line maps .",

    "<S> the fraction of the total stellar population contained in clusters for the nominal extinction model ranges from @xmath150 - 100% if the distributed population is relatively young ( @xmath2  10  myr ) , to @xmath125%-70% if it is relatively old ( @xmath1 100  myr ) . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively high fraction of stars contained in clusters regardless of the age of the distributed population , in conjunction with the young ages generally inferred for embedded clusters in nearby molecular clouds , indicates that a substantial fraction of the total stellar population in these regions has formed within the past few million years in dense clusters . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that either the star formation rate in each these clouds has recently peaked if one assumes clouds have ages @xmath3 10  myr , or molecular clouds are younger than typically thought if one assumes that the star formation rate has been approximately constant in time . </S>"
