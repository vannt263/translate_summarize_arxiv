    "over the last two decades , a great deal of attention has been paid to the so - called nonextensive tsallis entropy , both from theoretical and observational viewpoints .",
    "this particular nonextensive formulation @xcite seems to present a consistent theoretical tool to investigate complex systems in their nonequilibrium stationary states , systems with multifractal and self - similar structures , systems dominated by long - range interactions , anamolous diffusion phenomena , among others .",
    "some recent applications of tsallis entropy @xmath2 to a number of complex scenarios is now providing a more definite picture of the kind of physical problems to which this @xmath1-formalism can in fact be applied .    in this",
    "regard , systems of interest in geophysics has also been studied in light of this nonextensive formalism . in this particular context , the very first investigation was done by abe @xcite who showed that the statistical properties of three - dimensional distance between successive earthquakes follow a @xmath1-exponential function with the nonextensive parameter lying in the interval @xmath3 $ ] @xcite . since then ,",
    "other geophysical analyses have been performed as , for instance , the statistics of the calm time , which indicates a scale - free nature for earthquake phenomena and corresponds to a @xmath1-exponential distribution with @xmath4 @xcite , and models for temperature distributions and radon emission of volcanos @xcite .",
    "more recently , a very interesting model for earthquakes dynamics related to tsallis nonentensive framework has been proposed by sotolongo - costa and posadas ( scp model ) @xcite . such a model consists basically of two rough profiles interacting via fragments filling the gap between them , where the fragments are produced by local breakage of the local plates . by using the nonextensive formalism the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite not only showed the influence of the size distribution of fragments on the energy distribution of earthquakes but also deduced a new energy distribution function ( edf ) , which gives the well - known gutenberg - richter law @xcite as a particular case .    however , in dealing with this nonextensive framework , a particular attention must be paid to the possible definitions for mean values , which play a fundamental role within the domain of this nonextensive statistics @xcite . in this concern ,",
    "recent studies of the properties of the relative entropy and the shore - johnson theorem for consistent minimum cross - entropy principle , revealed the necessity of the so - called @xmath1-expectation value in studies involving this nonextensive statistical mechanics ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "thus , by introducing this @xmath1-definition of mean value we re - analyzed the fragment - asperity interaction model of sotolongo - costa and posadas @xcite .",
    "moreover , a new scale law between the released relative energy @xmath5 and the @xmath6-dimensional size of fragments has also been introduced . by using the standard method of entropy maximization",
    "we also deduced a new energy distribution function , which differs considerably from the one obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to test the viability of our appoach we used data taken from two seismic catalogs , namely , neic and bulletin seismic of the revista brasileira de geofisica .",
    "it is shown that although both approaches provide very similar values for the nonextensive parameter @xmath1 , the other physical quantity , e.g. , the energy density differ by several orders of magnitude .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the standard formalism of nonextensive statistical mechanics is reexamined , as well as the theorical basis of scp model . in sec iii ,",
    "a new edf is analytically calculated through extremization of tsallis entropy under the constrains of the @xmath1-expectation value and normalization condition . in sec iv , we test this new edf with data from two different catalogs and estimate the best - fit values for the nonextensive parameter @xmath1 and the proportionality constant between the released relative energy @xmath5 and the volume of the fragments @xmath7 , i.e. , the energy density , @xmath8 .",
    "we end this paper by emphasizing the main results in the conclusion section .",
    "in this section , we recall the nonextensive theoretical basis of the scp model",
    ". as widely known , the tsallis statistics generalizes the botzmann - gibbs statistics in what concerns the concept of entropy .",
    "such formalism is based on the parametric class of entropies given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the boltzmann constant . in the scp model",
    ", @xmath11 stands for the probability of finding a fragment of relative surface @xmath12 ( which is defined as a characteristic surface of the system ) , @xmath1 is the nonextensive parameter and the @xmath1-logarithmic function above is defined by @xmath13 which recovers the standard boltzmann - gibbs entropy @xmath14 in the limit @xmath15 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that most of the experimental evidence supporting tsallis proposal are related to the power - law distribution associated with @xmath2 descripition of the classical @xmath16-body problem @xcite .",
    "the scp model is a simple approach for earthquakes dynamics revealing a very interesting application of the tsallis framework .",
    "indeed , the fundamental idea consists in the fact that the space between faults is filled with the residues of the breakage of the tectonic plates . in this regard ,",
    "the authors studied the influence of the size distribution of fragments on the energy distribution of earthquakes .",
    "the theoretical motivation follows from the fragmentation phenomena @xcite in the context of the geophysics systems . in this latter work ,",
    "englaman et al showed that the standard botzmann - gibbs formalism , although useful , can not account for an important feature of fragmentation process , i.e. , the presence of scaling in the size distribution of fragments , which is one of the main ingredients of the scp approach .",
    "thus , a nonextensive formalism is not only justified in scp model but also necessary since the process of violent fractioning is very probably a nonextensive phenomenon , leading to long - range interactions among the parts of the object being fragmented ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in reality , such an influence was earlier emphasized in other investigations @xcite . in general lines ,",
    "the scp model follows similar arguments to those presented in refs .",
    "@xcite being , however , a more realistic seismic model than the one proposed in ref . @xcite .",
    "in particular , the theoretical ingredients reads :    * the mechanism of relative displacement of fault plates is the main cause of earthquakes ; * the surfaces of the tectonic plates are irregular and the fragments filling the space between them are very diverse and have irregular shapes ; * the mechanism of triggering earthquakes is established through the combination of irregularities of the fault planes and the distribution of fragments between them ; * the fragment distribution function and consequently the edf emerges naturally from a nonextensive framework .    from the above arguments ,",
    "the edf deduced in ref .",
    "@xcite is given by @xmath17 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the above expression describes very well the energy distribution in all detectable range of magnitudes , unlike the empirical formula of gutenberg - richter @xcite .    0.1 in",
    "now , let us discuss the standard method of maximization of the tsallis entropy . here and hereafter",
    ", the boltzmann constant is set equal to unity for the sake of simplicity .",
    "thus , the functional entropy to be maximized is @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the lagrange multipliers .",
    "the constrains used above are the normalization of the distribution @xmath21 and _ the @xmath1-expectation value _",
    "@xmath22 with the escort distribution @xcite given by @xmath23 by considering the same physical arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite , we derive , after some algebra , the following expresion for the fragment size distribution function @xmath24^{1 \\over 1-q},\\ ] ] which corresponds to the area distribution for the fragments of the fault plates . here , however , differently from ref .",
    "@xcite , which assumes @xmath25 , we use a new energy scale @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the proportionality between the released relative energy @xmath5 and @xmath7 ( @xmath27 is the size of fragments ) is now given by @xmath28 , where @xmath12 scales with @xmath29 and @xmath8 ( the proportionality constant between @xmath30 and @xmath7 ) has dimension of volumetric energy density .",
    "in particular , this new scale is in accordance with the standard theory of seismic rupture , the well - known seismic moment scaling with rupture length ( see , for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the new edf of earthquakes is , therefore , obtained by changing variables from @xmath31 to @xmath32 . from ( [ sigma ] )",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath33^{1 \\over q-1}},\\ ] ] which has also a power - law form with @xmath34 and @xmath35 given by @xmath36 in the above expression , the energy probability is written as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 corresponds to the number of earthquakes with energy @xmath30 and @xmath16 total number earthquakes .",
    "in order to test the viability of the new edf above derived [ eq .",
    "( [ pe ] ) ] we introduce the cumulative number of earthquakes , given by integral @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the number of earthquakes with energy larger than @xmath41 .",
    "now , substituting ( [ pe ] ) into ( [ inte ] ) , and considering @xmath42 ( @xmath43 stands for magnitude ) it is possible to calculate the above expression . in reality , note that depending on the value of @xmath1 the limits of the integral ( [ inte ] ) presents a cutoff on the maximum value allowed for energy @xmath5 , which is given by @xmath44 for the intervals @xmath45 and @xmath46 , while for @xmath47 the cutoff is absent in the distribution .",
    "note also that in the limit @xmath15 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 goes to the exponential function .",
    "as matter of fact , the calculation of the integral ( [ inte ] ) for @xmath50 leads to the general expression @xmath51 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which , similarly to the modified gutenberg - ricther law ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for more details ) , describes appropriately the energy distribution in a wider detectable range of magnitudes .",
    "figure 1 shows the relative cumulative number of earthquakes ( @xmath52 ) as a function of the magnitude @xmath43 .",
    "the data points , corresponding to earthquakes events lying in the interval @xmath53 , were taken from two different catalogs , namely , bulletin seismic of the revista brasileira de geofsica ( left panels ) and neic ( central and right panels ) .",
    "the left , central and right panels show the results of our analysis for the samambaia fault , brazil ( 100 events ) , new madrid fault , usa ( 173 events ) , and anatolian fault , turkey ( 8980 events ) , respectively .",
    "we note that , similarly to original version of scp model , our approach , represented by eqs .",
    "( [ sigma])-([11 ] ) , provide a very good fit to the experimental data of the two catalogs here considered .",
    "it is worth emphasizing , however , that the energy density differ by several orders of magnitude from our model to the original scp model .",
    "therefore , we expect that other independent estimates of the parameter @xmath8 may indicate which approach is more physically realistic . the estimates of the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath8 obtained in this paper and in ref",

    "@xcite , what seems to be the correct definition for expectation values within the tsallis nonextensive statistical mechanics was rediscussed . based on properties of the generalized relative entropies and the shore - johnson theorem ,",
    "it was shown that the expectation value of any physical quantity in this extended framework converges to the normalized @xmath1-expectation value , instead of to the ordinary definition .    in this paper , by considering this _ necessity _ of @xmath1-expectation values in tsallis nonextensive framework , we have revisited the fragment - asperity interaction model for earthquakes , as introduced in ref .",
    "a new energy distribution function has been calculated , which allowed us to determine the relative cumulative number of earthquakes as a function of the magnitude .",
