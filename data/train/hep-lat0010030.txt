    "lattice qcd allows a first principles determination of hadronic properties , including the matrix elements of operators between hadronic states . among the more interesting matrix elements are those of the @xmath5 , four - fermion operators which are responsible for the decay of a kaon into two pions .",
    "these matrix elements are needed to relate the values of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix in the standard model to physical measurements .",
    "direct measurements of @xmath6 on the lattice are not possible @xcite , due to the two pions in the final state , although a recent suggestion involving tuning the lattice volume @xcite looks promising .",
    "alternatively , lowest order chiral perturbation theory can be used to relate @xmath7 to @xmath8 and @xmath2 matrix elements @xcite , which can be measured on the lattice .",
    "this approach has been extensively studied and , while quite straight - forward in principle , requires careful control over a wide range of phenomena .    of central importance to a calculation relying on chiral perturbation theory",
    "is precise control over chiral symmetry on the lattice .",
    "a major advance in this long - standing problem is the idea of four - dimensional chiral fermions arising from mass defects in a higher - dimensional fermion formulation @xcite . with improved chiral symmetry at finite lattice spacing , the lattice ward - takahashi identities , without complicated renormalization ,",
    "are much closer to the continuum ones . here",
    "we seek to understand how the residual chiral symmetry breaking effects for domain wall fermions enter the removal of unphysical , power divergent contributions , which is needed to get @xmath9 from @xmath1 and @xmath10 matrix elements .",
    "the riken - bnl research center / bnl/ columbia ( rbc ) collaboration has recently finished extensive quenched simulations of the hadron spectrum and low - energy qcd physics , using domain wall fermions @xcite , with a particular focus on the residual chiral symmetry breaking effects due to finite values for the fifth dimension , @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "( similar work was also reported in @xcite . )",
    "this work produced quantitative values for the residual quark mass @xmath12 , which enters low energy qcd physics through the effective quark mass , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the input bare quark mass .",
    "the residual quark mass was shown to be small , @xmath15 the strange quark mass for @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "it was also found that topological near - zero modes of the domain wall fermion operator , which are not suppressed by a fermionic determinant in quenched simulations , have pronounced effects on quark propagators for small @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , for large volumes where topological near - zero mode effects are suppressed , a non - linear dependence of @xmath18 on @xmath14 was found , consistent with a quenched chiral logarithm .",
    "thus , even though the chiral properties of domain wall fermions are quite improved over other formulations , these quenched pathologies can appear in simulation results .",
    "we have also finished measuring @xmath1 and @xmath19 matrix elements for the 10 @xmath3 effective four - fermion operators @xcite relevant to determinations of @xmath20 and the real parts of the @xmath21 and 3/2 amplitudes for @xmath22 decays .",
    "we have results for 200 quenched lattices of size @xmath23 with @xmath17 and @xmath24 and a variety of light and heavy quark masses .",
    "( for more details about the simulations see @xcite . )",
    "the analysis of these results requires control over the residual chiral symmetry breaking effects and an understanding of the role of quenched pathologies in our data .",
    "this report is a summary of our progress to date .",
    "a final step in determining physical matrix elements is the matching of continuum and lattice operators .",
    "this has been done using non - perturbative renormalization @xcite and details can be found in @xcite .",
    "furman and shamir @xcite defined axial transformations for domain wall fermions , which lead to the ward - takahashi identity @xmath25 here @xmath26 at the four - dimensional point @xmath27 includes spinors from all values of the the fifth coordinate . the pseudoscalar density @xmath28 is constructed from four - dimensional fields in the standard way and @xmath29 is constructed from `` mid - point '' spinors at @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "( the notation is as in @xcite . )    for physics that involves momentum scales much less than the cutoff , the extra term in eq .",
    "[ eq : ward_tak_id ] involving @xmath32 ( the `` mid - point '' term ) , gives a contribution of the form @xmath33 .",
    "this defines @xmath12 to @xmath34 , since the low - energy qcd physics of domain wall fermions should by describable by an effective lagrangian .",
    "however , in matrix elements involving divergent quantities one only expects that @xmath35 . since divergent expressions enter in @xmath36 amplitudes and we must manipulate the ward - takahashi identities to remove them , these effects need to be understood .    to test our understanding of @xmath12 effects and our data ,",
    "we first consider @xmath37 in eq .",
    "[ eq : ward_tak_id ] . summing over",
    "@xmath27 gives ( no sum on @xmath38 ) @xmath39 j^a_5(y ) \\rangle      - \\langle \\overline{q } q \\rangle = 0    \\label{eq : int_wi}\\ ] ] the term in the sum without @xmath40 gives @xmath41 pion pole terms plus @xmath42 contact terms along with constant terms and terms of higher order in @xmath14 .",
    "similarly the mid - point term gives @xmath43 pion pole terms , plus @xmath44 contact terms as well as constant contributions .",
    "the pion pole terms enter as @xmath45 in eq .",
    "[ eq : int_wi ] while the contact contributions enter as @xmath46 .",
    "this form for the pion pole term is consistent with @xmath47 at @xmath48 .",
    "thus we are lead to expect a gell - mann  oakes  renner relation for domain wall fermions with the form @xmath49 this relation holds at non - zero values for @xmath14 , with the @xmath50 contact term contribution being cancelled by the similar term in @xmath51 .",
    "of course , there may be other quenched pathologies entering this expression , such as effects from topological near - zero modes or quenched chiral logarithms .",
    "we have measured @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath12 and @xmath54 for @xmath55 lattices at @xmath16 @xcite and plot our results in figure [ fig : gmor ] .",
    "one sees that for @xmath17 , the larger mass points are approximately linear , but do not seem to extrapolate towards the value of @xmath54 at @xmath56 . for @xmath57 ,",
    "the extrapolation is much closer , as is expected since @xmath12 has decreased by almost a factor of 2 .",
    "also shown are solid lines representing the left - hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : gmor ] when a quenched chiral logarithm fit is used for @xmath58 .",
    "one sees that the effect of chiral logarithms is to exacerbate the disagreement in the extrapolation .",
    "thus we have evidence for residual mass contact terms in this simple ward - takahashi identity .    in conclusion , we note that for @xmath17 , the quantity @xmath59 , which is 1 in chiral perturbation theory , differs from 1 by around 20% for our data .",
    "thus one should avoid introducing extraneous powers of this quantity while manipulating the data .",
    "we now turn to the ward - takahashi identities useful for subtracting the divergent contributions to @xmath1 matrix elements .",
    "here we discuss our tests of a particular method for removing the divergent effects in @xmath61 matrix elements .",
    "following @xcite , we define a subtracted operator @xmath62    \\label{eq : osub}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is a @xmath3 four - fermion operator and @xmath64 is chosen such that @xmath65 then following @xcite , but noting that contact terms in the ward - takahashi identities coming from @xmath12 effects will enter , we find @xmath66 where the derivative removes any contact terms proportional to @xmath12 .    the successful removal of the effects of mixing with the dimension three operators implemented in eq .",
    "[ eq : osub ] requires chiral symmetry .",
    "we first check this with a simpler ward - takahashi identity , obtained by inserting an operator @xmath67 in eq .",
    "[ eq : ward_tak_id ] .",
    "the pion pole terms in the ward - takahashi identity then lead to @xmath68 there are no power divergent operators in this ward - takahashi identity , so the coefficient of the @xmath14 and @xmath12 contact terms are finite , but there may still be quenched chiral logarithm effects present . in figure",
    "[ fig : k2pi_sbard ] we plot the left - hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq : k2pi_sbard ] versus @xmath14 .",
    "we see that for larger @xmath14 , the points appear to extrapolate reasonably well to 1 , but there is noticeable curvature for small quark masses .",
    "the figure includes results for axial vector sources , which agree with those for pseudoscalar sources , indicating that topological near - zero modes are not the origin of this non - linearity .",
    "we are investigating whether this can be explained as a quenched chiral logarithm .",
    "=    we determine @xmath64 from measurements of @xmath69 for non - degenerate masses for the strange and down quarks .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig : o2 ] shows a plot of @xmath70 versus @xmath71 .",
    "we see good linearity which allows for a reliable determination of @xmath72 , with statistically errors at the few percent level for this particular operator .",
    "=    with the value of @xmath72 determined , @xmath73 is known and figure [ fig : o2 ] shows @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the @xmath76 part of @xmath4 . in lowest order chiral perturbation theory ,",
    "the denominator is a constant , so the desired @xmath0 matrix element is given by the slope and the intercept is related to @xmath12 .",
    "we are looking carefully for non - linearities in our data , paying particular attention to the quenched chiral logarithm effects recently calculated in @xcite .",
    "we have seen that the ward - takahashi identities for domain wall fermions include @xmath44 contact terms which can be removed by taking derivatives with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "our data also show evidence for non - linear dependence on @xmath14 , some of which may be due to quenched chiral logarithms .",
    "we have shown that the subtracted operator @xmath73 can be determined and are now doing the subtractions for all the operators .",
