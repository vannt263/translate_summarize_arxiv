    "two of the most basic questions concerning any knot invariant are : `` does it detect the unknot ? '' and `` is it additive under connected sum ? '' among the classical topologically - defined invariants , seifert genus and bridge number are both well - known for their `` yes '' answers to both questions .",
    "other invariants such as tunnel number and gabai width , although they both detect the unknot , have more complicated stories when it comes to additivity . in this paper , we define , for almost any graph in almost any 3-manifold , two new families of invariants which both detect the unknot in @xmath0 and are additive under connected sum . for graphs ,",
    "they also satisfy a certain type of additivity under trivalent vertex sum . in this introduction",
    ", we give a brief overview of the definition of the invariants ( leaving the technicalities until later in the paper ) , state our main results , and discuss the connection between our invariants and the classical invariants of bridge number , tunnel number , and gabai width .",
    "this work relies on our previous paper @xcite .",

    "we make the following :    _ running assumption : _ every sphere in @xmath2 separates , and @xmath4 has no vertices of valence 2 .    if @xmath4 is a 1manifold properly embedded in a 3-manifold @xmath2 , we will write @xmath5 to mean @xmath2 with an open regular neighborhood of @xmath4 removed . if @xmath6 is a properly embedded surface ,",
    "we write @xmath7 to mean that @xmath8 is transverse to @xmath4 and @xmath9 to indicate the result of removing an open regular neighborhood of @xmath8 from both @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "all surfaces appearing in this paper are orientable .",
    "a surface @xmath7 is * essential * if it is incompressible , not @xmath10-parallel in the exterior of @xmath4 , and not a 2-sphere disjoint from @xmath4 bounding a 3-ball disjoint from @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath11 is a ( 2 or 3-dimensional ) manifold , we use the notation @xmath12 to mean that @xmath13 is a connected component of @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , @xmath14 will indicate that @xmath15 is a component of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",

    "we say that @xmath1 is * irreducible * if @xmath4 is irreducible and if every ( tame ) sphere in @xmath5 bounds a 3-ball in @xmath18 .",
    "for a 3-manifold @xmath2 , we let @xmath19 denote its heegaard genus , i.e. the minimal genus of a heegaard surface for @xmath2 .",
    "the * tunnel number * for a pair @xmath1 is one less than the heegaard genus for the exterior of @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath20 . a * lens space * is any compact , connected , orientable 3-manifold @xmath2 such that @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",

    "the initials `` v.p . ''",
    "stand for `` vertex - punctured '' and indicate that vertices in @xmath4 are treated in a similar way to boundary components of @xmath2 .",
    "the components of @xmath25 can be partitioned into two sets : the thick surfaces and the thin surfaces .",
    "the union of the thick surfaces is denoted @xmath26 and the union of the thin surfaces is denoted @xmath27 ( so @xmath28 means that @xmath29 is a thick surface and @xmath30 means that @xmath31 is a thin surface . ) we will consider multiple v.p .- bridge surfaces @xmath25 which are _ reduced _ , _ linear _ , and _",

    "see section [ sec : prel ] for precise definitions .",
    "we let @xmath32 denote the set of reduced , linear , oriented multiple v.p .- bridge surfaces for @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath33 is a ( 3-manifold , graph)-pair and if @xmath7 is a surface , we define the * extent * of @xmath8 to be @xmath34 if @xmath8 is connected , this is simply @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the genus of @xmath8 .",
    "two cases are of particular interest : if @xmath8 is a minimal bridge sphere for a link @xmath37 , then @xmath38 is one less than the bridge number @xmath39 of @xmath4 , and if @xmath8 is a minimal genus heegaard surface for the exterior of a link @xmath37 , then @xmath38 is the tunnel number @xmath40 of @xmath4 . in both cases",
    ", @xmath8 will meet the requirements for being a v.p .- bridge surface for @xmath41 .",
    "for a given @xmath42 , we define the * net extent * @xmath43 and * width * @xmath44 as follows : @xmath45 to each multiple v.p .- bridge surface , we can also associate a number , the * net euler characteristic * of @xmath25 which is simply @xmath46    our two families of invariants are then defined as @xmath47 in both cases , the minimum is taken over all @xmath42 having the property that @xmath48 . as noted above for a knot @xmath49 , @xmath50 is related to classical invariants : for any @xmath51 , the quantity @xmath50 is at most @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the bridge number of @xmath54 and , for large enough @xmath55 , @xmath50 is also at most the tunnel number @xmath56 of @xmath54 .    the formula for width , on the other hand , is motivated by the well - known formula for gabai",

    "consider multiple v.p .- bridge surfaces @xmath25 for @xmath57 with the property that the components of @xmath25 are concentric spheres .",
    "then gabai width is defined as the minimum over all such @xmath25 of the quantity @xmath58 our invariant @xmath59 for knots in @xmath0 can be seen as a variant of gabai width , where we generalize the types of surfaces @xmath25 admitted into the sum and adjust the formula to take into account the euler characteristics of the spheres .",
    "we prove ( corollary [ cor : non - negativity for surfaces ] ) that , as long as @xmath60 , where @xmath19 is the heegaard genus of @xmath2 , both @xmath61 and @xmath62 are non - negative .",
    "indeed , theorem [ net extent detects unknot ] shows that if @xmath4 is a knot and if @xmath2 does not have a lens space summand , then @xmath63 implies that @xmath64 and @xmath4 is the unknot .",
    "a similar result holds for width , although we need to add more hypotheses on @xmath2 or @xmath55 .",
    "finally , we make a passing comment on the role of @xmath55 .",
    "when working with bridge surfaces or heegaard surfaces , it is often useful to maintain some control over the euler characteristic of the surfaces .",
    "introducing the parameter @xmath55 allows us to do that .",
    "observe that , by the definition , both net extent and width are non - increasing as @xmath55 increases .",
    "that is , for all @xmath65 , @xmath66 it is easily seen that the values of both @xmath67 and @xmath68 are integers or half - integers .",
    "thus , the sequences @xmath69 and @xmath70 are eventually constant at @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "suppose that @xmath73 and @xmath74 are disjoint ( 3-manifold , graph ) pairs such that @xmath75 and @xmath76 are either both disjoint from the vertices of @xmath77 and @xmath78 or both are trivalent vertices of @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",

    "since we require that the summing be done sequentially , the graph in @xmath2 dual to the summing spheres is a tree . under the assumption that no sphere in @xmath2 is non - separating , that @xmath4 is a knot , and that @xmath1 is non - trivial , then miyazaki ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1 ) has shown that @xmath1 has a unique prime factorization , up to re - ordering .",
    "this was extended to the situation where @xmath4 is a @xmath95-graph by matveev and turaev @xcite .",

    "we prove :    let @xmath112 be non - trivial , and let @xmath55 be any integer with @xmath60 .",
    "then there is a prime factorization of @xmath1 into @xmath97 so that there exist integers @xmath113 , summing to at most @xmath114 , and @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the number of thrice punctured spheres in the decomposition .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath117 or if @xmath118 and @xmath119 , then also @xmath120    the result for width is particularly striking . for many years , it was an open question as to whether or not gabai width satisfied an additivity property with respect to connected sum of knots .",
    "indeed , for some classes of knots @xcite , gabai width is additive . in @xcite , however , scharlemann and thompson proposed counter - examples to the additivity of gabai width and in @xcite , blair and tomova proved that one of those proposed counter - examples is actually a counter - example .",
    "on the other hand , theorem [ main theorem ] shows that our invariant @xmath121 , which is a slightly modified version of gabai width , _ is _ additive under connected sum and , even more surprisingly , `` higher genus '' widths are also additive . for more details ,",
    "see section [ comparison ] .",
