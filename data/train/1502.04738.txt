    "( h ) shows an  1330    sji space ",
    "time plot from the same cut  1 at higher resolution with similar behaviors because of    in the doppler velocity distribution observed by , a striking feature is a _ two - component composition _ during the early phase of the eruption : a primary ( a ) bright and broad component being slightly blueshifted and/or mildly redshifted , and a secondary ( b ) highly redshifted , comparably faint and narrow component , as shown in .",
    "the two components , yet with different structures , are somewhat parallel to each other , separated by @xmath1@xmath2 , with a similar trend of growing redshifts ( up to @xmath0 ) with height .",
    "they can be identified in all bright lines , including the  2796    and h  2803   ,  1335 and 1336   , and  1403    lines .",
    "( note that the  1335    component  b almost overlaps with the 1336    component  a. ) one possibility consistent with the gap between the two components is that the erupting material is spatially distributed in a _ hollow _ , rather than _ solid _ , cone shape .",
    "as time progresses , the two components gradually merge into a single component with decreasing line widths . at later times",
    ", the entire spectrum evolves from red- to blueshifts , while maintaining the same general slope with height as noted below ( see , bottom ) .",
    "this evolution can be clearly seen from the wavelength or velocity  time plot shown in ( g ) , obtained by averaging the  2796    spectra over the entire region above the chromospheric limb .",
    "we fitted the velocity  time positions of component b and later the merged single component with a smooth spline function , shown as the solid green curve , to characterize the temporal evolution .",
    "this curve exhibits an initially rapid and then gradual decline with time , similar to that of the pos velocity shown in ( f ) .",
    "more interestingly , its crossing at zero doppler velocity , i.e. , the change from red- to blueshifts at 02:50  ut ( marked by the vertical dotted line ) , _ coincides with _ the switch of sign for the pos velocity and the apexes of the ballistic pos trajectories shown in ( e ) , indicating a transition from upward eruption to downward fallback of the material .",
    "this transition may also explain the onset of the faster drop of the  2796    intensity at the same time ( see ( d ) , red line ) .",
    "we can estimate the 3d velocity vector using simultaneous pos and doppler velocities .",
    "for example , during 02:3002:45  ut , the two velocities ( ( f ) , red crosses and green curve ) are almost the same , indicating an angle of @xmath1@xmath49 behind the pos .",
    "this is an upper limit , because the eruption component  b has the highest redshift .",
    "a more accurate estimate can be obtained during the late phase when the velocity distribution is relatively simple . at 03:06:15  ut ( see ( h ) )",
    ", for instance , the fallback material exhibits blueshifts increasing almost linearly with decreasing heights .",
    "this is consistent with a similar trend of the pos velocity ( white dashed line ) obtained from the last parabolic trajectory in ( e ) covering this time .",
    "specifically , the blueshift increases from @xmath50 to @xmath51 by 36% over the pos height range of @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) within the  fov .",
    "this percentage change is similar to the 33% increase of the pos velocity from @xmath54 at 03:03:32  ut to @xmath55 at 03:08:04  ut over the same height range .",
    "these two pairs of velocities give a consistent angle of @xmath56 between the velocity vector and pos .",
    "this provides additional support for our interpretation of the late - phase blueshift as evidence of material falling back , and implies that the fallback trajectory within this height range is oriented at a constant angle from the pos .",
    "helical structures have been commonly seen in imaging or spectroscopic observations of solar eruptions , including cmes , prominence eruptions , and jets or surges @xcite .",
    "we found compelling new evidence in this event , with the combination of high - resolution sjis and spectra offering critical clues to the 3d structure .    in the pos ,",
    "aia images show cork - screw shaped threads , especially early in the eruption when the morphology is relatively simple ( e.g. , ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "their temporal evolution is manifested in the multiple sinusoidal tracks shown in ( i ) , an  1330    sji space  time plot obtained from cut  2 , perpendicular to the eruption axis .",
    "in contrast , during the late phase , e.g. , after 03:00  ut , the falling material shows no longer sinusoidal , but essentially flat tracks .",
    "this suggests that the pre - stored magnetic helicity or twists have been transported into the heliosphere by the eruption and thus the falling material returns as streamline flows along untwisted field lines , similar to those in previously reported helical jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "doppler measurements by  provide several clues for the interpretation of the above pos observations as torsional / rotational motions , rather than transverse oscillations .",
    "the  slit is oriented at @xmath33 clockwise from the central axis of the eruption , allowing it to cover both sides of the axis , i.e. , with its lower portion sampling the left - hand side and the upper portion sampling the right - hand side .",
    "we find that early in the eruption , the initial blueshifts of some individual features switch to redshifts _ with time _ as they travel upward along the slit ( see ( a)(c ) and animation  2 for an example ) .",
    "moreover , in _ single spectral snapshots _ , the primary ( a ) spectral component of the eruption at times show predominant blueshifts at lower heights that smoothly transition to redshifts at larger heights ( e.g. , ( b ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "the combination of these observations indicates a _ counter - clockwise rotation _ of the erupting material when viewed top - down .",
    "note that sometimes both components  a and b show no sign of blueshifts but only redshifts that generally grow with height .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the eruption occurs behind the limb and large redshifts due to outward radial motions are expected and can reduce or even reverse the blueshifts caused by rotations .",
    "we can further infer the handedness of the helices by combining pos and doppler observations .",
    "early in the event , sjis show material threads progressing transversely from left to right . to be consistent with the above inferred counter - clockwise rotations with dominant blueshifts on the left , such threads must be located on the _ front side _ of the eruption , although the  1330    sji emission is likely optically thin above the  limb and thus we are seeing both the front and back sides . noting that these threads are oriented from lower - right to upper - left , we conclude that they are _ left - handed helices_. their counter - clockwise rotations are thus consistent with relaxation or unwinding , rather than tightening , motions of the helices , which are expected for such an eruption .",
    "we also found sinusoidal spectral variations along the slit and their progression toward greater heights with time , best seen during 02:31:1202:32:19  ut ( ( d ) ) .",
    "this may be evidence of ( multiple ) small - scale ( @xmath1@xmath57 across ) helical sub - structures within the overall eruption , which are also evident in sjis ( e.g. , see the unfolding feature near 02:45  ut in animation  2 ) .",
    "the  2796    and h  2803    lines and their intensity ratio can provide useful plasma diagnostics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in general , this k / h ratio is expected to be @xmath12 for optically thin , collisionally excited ( thermal ) emission .",
    "previously reported values include 2 for an active - region prominence @xcite , 1.7 for a quiescent prominence @xcite , and 1.331.35 for quiescent prominences",
    "recently observed by   .    as shown in ( top ) , we identified various corresponding features in both the k and h lines , integrated their continuum - subtracted intensities , and obtained their ratios , which are labeled together with the line - centroid doppler velocities .",
    "the mid row in shows some sample spectra at selected positions . unlike their on - disk or chromospheric counterparts , the off - limb  and h lines of both erupted material and coronal rain have no central reversal , similar to those in  observed prominences , suggestive of a low pressure or thickness and optically - thin regime .",
    "however , for the fallback material ( ( f ) ) , the k line has a comparably lower peak intensity .",
    "we repeated this analysis for a total of 156 features selected from eight spectra through the course of this event .",
    "the resulting intensity ratio is plotted against the line - centroid doppler velocity and k line intensity ( ( g ) and ( h ) ) , categorized for four types of features : the primary ( a ; black plus signs ) and secondary ( b ; green diamonds ) eruption components , fallback material ( blue triangles ) , and coronal rain ( red crosses ) . as a reference ,",
    "the k / h ratios of the on - disk quiet sun and chromosphere at the limb have medians and standard deviations of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "the coronal rain has the highest k / h ratio of @xmath60 , the lowest doppler velocity nearly zero , and a moderate intensity .",
    "eruption component  a has a moderate k / h ratio of @xmath61 , a small doppler velocity , and the highest intensity of @xmath62 .",
    "eruption component  b has a somewhat smaller ratio of @xmath63 , the highest doppler velocity of @xmath3@xmath2 redshifts , and a moderate intensity about 6 times smaller than that of component  a. the fallback material has the lowest k / h ratio of @xmath64 , a moderate blueshift , and the lowest intensity .",
    "the k / h ratios of the fallback material are particularly interesting , yet puzzling . during the late phase of the event , as progressively less material",
    "is present off - limb and as the intensity drops with time , one would expect the  and h emission to approach the optically - thin regime and thus a k / h ratio close to 2 .",
    "however , the @xmath65 median ratio is surprisingly small , the lowest among all reported values for prominences and even less than those of the quiet - sun disk ( @xmath58 ) and chromosphere ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "more interestingly , the k / h ratio @xmath66 is highly correlated with both the line - centroid doppler velocity @xmath67 and the k line intensity @xmath68 , with linear correlation coefficients of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "a linear regression gives @xmath71 , leading to a ratio of unity at @xmath72 .",
    "we also obtained  1330    sji intensities averaged within the y - direction ranges corresponding to those boxes defined in the spectra of the fallback material ( e.g. ( c ) ) and within an x - direction range of @xmath73 covering all the 8-step raster positions .",
    "they show a comparably weak but noticeable correlation with the k / h ratios .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising because of the similar temporal trends of the  1330    sji and  line intensities , as shown in ( d ) .",
    "we note that the off - limb k and h lines have contributions from both radiative excitation by the solar surface radiation and local collisional ( thermal ) excitation .",
    "their relative importance depends on the pressure ( density and temperature ) of the material and is estimated as follows .",
    "we assume that the  line emitting plasma is optically thin , an assumption valid only for thin , low - pressure prominence threads .",
    "then each plasma blob receives the full incident radiation and emits both scattered ( @xmath74 ) and thermal ( @xmath75 ) radiation .",
    "regardless of the frequency redistribution process , @xmath74 is the product of the geometric dilution factor and the chromospheric intensity , for which we adopt the line - center intensity of @xmath76 from .",
    "@xmath75 is the product of the photon destruction probability @xmath77 and the planck function @xmath78 at the plasma temperature @xmath10 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath77 is proportional to the electron density @xmath79 and steadily increases with @xmath10 ( so does @xmath78 ) .",
    "we find that    1 .   for a typical prominence density of @xmath80 ( e.g. ,",
    "see table  4 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a low temperature of @xmath81 , the radiation term @xmath74 dominates over the collisional term @xmath75 by orders of magnitude , while 2 .   an increase in density above @xmath82 and/or in temperature to @xmath83 would result in the collisional - term dominance .",
    "determining the relative importance of @xmath74 and @xmath75 for the specific event under study requires the knowledge of the plasma density . to this end",
    ", we utilized the density sensitive  1399.774/1401.156    line ratio . in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio",
    ", we first obtained a spectrum ( see ( a ) ) by averaging two raster scans when these lines are relatively bright and overlaps due to doppler shifts are relatively small .",
    "we then averaged all off - limb spectra to obtain the profile shown in ( b ) , which then gives a continuum - subtracted , integrated  1399.774/1401.156    intensity ratio of 0.234 for the primary ( a ) eruption component .",
    "according to the chianti  v7.1 database @xcite , this ratio translates to a predicted density of @xmath84 ( see ( c ) ) .",
    "its uncertainty originates mainly from line blending , which is estimated as follows : ( i ) we found that the  1399.774    line is blended by the  1399.962    line at an upper - limit 6% level . ( ii )",
    "we could not identify any  1401.514    line emission beyond the quiet - sun disk and thus its blend to the  1401.156    line is considered negligible .",
    "nevertheless , we assumed a conservative 20% uncertainty for the line ratio , which gives a density range of @xmath85@xmath86 .    for radiatively excited emission from moving objects , there is a _",
    "doppler dimming _ effect in which the incident line emission from the solar surface is doppler - shifted out of resonance .",
    "this effect has been extensively investigated for hydrogen and helium lines and recently modeled for the  and h lines .",
    "note that the wings of the chromospheric k and h lines are somewhat different .",
    "therefore , when a moving object resonantly absorbs the doppler - shifted wings followed by de - excitation radiation , the emergent k / h ratio can depend on the doppler velocity .",
    "this may potentially explain their observed correlation . as a proof - of - concept exercise",
    ", we model the /h ratio due to doppler dimming as follows .",
    "again , we assume that the erupted material is optically thin and ignore collisional excitation according to the above analysis . thus the  and h emission is simply resonant scattering of the incident chromospheric radiation , with no radiative transfer taking place .",
    "we also assume that the solar surface is a sphere producing uniform radiation , for which we adopt an -observed quiet - sun  and h spectrum , and ignore limb darkening or brightening . for an object at a height",
    "@xmath87 moving at a velocity @xmath88 in the radial direction , we calculate its incident radiation by integrating the doppler - shifted radiation from the entire visible solar surface , as schematically shown in ( a ) .",
    "this spatial average can alter the shape of the absorbed line profile , because the radial velocity @xmath88 has different parallel components @xmath89 projected along incident rays from different directions that determine the doppler shifts . as an example , ( b ) and ( c ) show the average  and h profiles incident on an object moving at different velocities at a height of 100  mm , which is near the lower limit of the height range of the -observed prominence material according to its behind - the - limb source location . at @xmath90@xmath91 ,",
    "the central reversals of both lines disappear . because mg is a heavy element , the thermal broadening is expected to be small and",
    "we assume a delta - function profile for the scattering agent ( moving object ) .",
    "thus the scattered emission is essentially the incident radiation at the line center ( @xmath92 ) , as marked by the vertical dashed line .",
    "the ratio of the k and h intensity at this position , as shown in ( d ) , would be equivalent to the observed line ratio .",
    "for a stationary object ( @xmath93 ) , this k / h ratio is @xmath94 . for a moving object ,",
    "the two lines are dimmed by different factors . at @xmath95 , for example , the k line center intensity is reduced by a factor of 0.10 , while the h line by 0.14,leading to @xmath96 .",
    "such dimming factors are on the same order of magnitude as those modeled for a moving prominence .",
    "repeating this for different height @xmath87 and velocity @xmath88 values , we obtained the dependence of the k / h ratio @xmath66 on these two quantities , as shown in ( e ) .",
    "these curves have a butterfly shape and generally decrease with increasing @xmath88 or @xmath87 .",
    "there is a positive correlation between @xmath66 and @xmath88 near @xmath95 ( @xmath970 for falling material ) , which qualitatively agrees with the observed correlation shown in ( g ) .",
    "a blue - red asymmetry is present , with smaller k / h ratios for radially outward velocities ( @xmath88@xmath30 ) , because of the asymmetry in the  and h wings . for lower heights ,",
    "the butterfly curves have a broader top portion at values close to that at @xmath93 , because relatively more incident radiation originates from large angles away from the local radial direction at the object .",
    "such radiation is less doppler - shifted due to the smaller @xmath89 component of the assumed radial velocity projected along those rays .",
    "note that the eruption component  b is about @xmath2 higher in doppler velocity and a factor of 6 fainter in intensity than component  a , and even fainter than the coronal rain .",
    "we suggest that doppler dimming may contribute to its faintness , among other possible factors , such as a smaller emission measure .",
    "1 .   the ejected material is detected in bright lines at chromospheric to transition - region temperatures ( @xmath98@xmath38 ) .",
    "we find no obvious delay among lines at different temperatures , suggesting _ no detectable temperature changes _ ( see ) .",
    "2 .   the prominence eruption has a maximum pos velocity of @xmath1@xmath99 and redshift of @xmath0 , while the white - light cme has a maximum pos speed of @xmath27 ( ) .",
    "these values are near the _ higher end _ of the velocity distribution reported for prominence eruptions .",
    "the erupting material exhibits a cascade with time toward lower velocities , with a transition from upward ejection to downward fallback consistently manifested in _ both pos velocities and doppler shifts _ ( red to blue drift ) . during the fallback phase , at a given time ,",
    "larger blueshifts are found at lower heights , consistent with the downward acceleration of the falling material ; at a given height , the blueshift increases with time , consistent with the fact that material falling later returns from greater heights and is originally ejected at larger initial velocities earlier .",
    "there are _ two components _ of erupted material in doppler velocity : a primary ( a ) , bright component of comparably small doppler shifts and a secondary ( b ) , faint , highly redshifted component .",
    "the two components are separated by @xmath1@xmath2 , suggestive of a hollow , rather than solid , cone shape , in which the material is distributed ( ) .",
    "we also suggest that stronger doppler dimming of component  b can contribute to its relatively smaller intensity .",
    "the combination of a blue- to redshift transition with height along the slit and cork - screw shaped threads and sinusoidal transverse motions imaged in the pos indicates that the eruption involves a _ left - handed helical structure _ undergoing counter - clockwise ( when viewed top - down ) unwinding / relaxation motions ( ) . such a handedness originating from the southern hemisphere ( ar  12051 ) is opposite to the dominant hemispheric rule of magnetic helicity for active regions .",
    "we find a wide range of /h line intensity ratios .",
