    "many problems in quantum physics can be discussed using a model in which one or more mesoscopic or even macroscopic coordinates @xmath4 , etc .",
    ", interact with a background environment ( one coordinate might also represent an experimental probe , or even an observer ) . in such models ( which have a long history @xcite ) all variables , including the environmental ones , are treated _ quantum - mechanically_. the aim is to find the behaviour of @xmath4 , etc . , after _ averaging _ over the environmental variables in some way .",
    "it is certainly not obvious that one can discuss the real world in this way , given the complexity of @xmath1-body systems .",
    "however we now know that many ( but not all ) mesoscopic or macroscopic systems can be described _ at low energies _ by a few `` canonical models '' , where a simple `` central system '' ( eg . , a 2-level system , or an oscillator ) couples to an environment .",
    "remarkably , there appear to be only two types of environment , describable as baths of either oscillators or spins .",
    "one way of trying to justify such models is the `` renormalisation group '' viewpoint @xcite , which maintains that most physical systems fall into a few `` universality classes '' , each scaling to its own `` fixed point '' in the space of possible hamiltonians .",
    "all systems in a given university class use the same canonical hamiltonian- the differences between different systems lying in the different values of the relevant couplings in this hamiltonian .",
    "although this `` hard rg '' philosophy clearly fails in some cases , it is a useful starting point for the present article , in which the quantum environment is modelled by a `` spin bath '' ( usually of 2-level systems , or `` spin-@xmath5 '' systems ) .",
    "the finite hilbert space of each bath spin makes the spin bath appropriate for describing the low energy dynamics of a set of _ localised _ environmental modes .",
    "we concentrate on one particular `` central spin '' model @xcite in which the central system itself reduces to a 2-level system ; but we also discuss cases where the central system is a one - dimensional coordinate ( a `` particle '' ) moving through a field of spins .",
    "another well - known set of canonical models describes the environment as a set of uncoupled oscillators- these include the `` spin- boson '' model @xcite and the `` caldeira - leggett '' model @xcite .",
    "the spin - boson model couples a central 2-level system to the oscillators , and is thus the analogue of the central spin model ; and the caldeira - leggett model couples a tunneling particle to the oscillators .",
    "these oscillator models all derive from a scheme proposed by feynman and vernon @xcite , to describe a central system coupled _ weakly _ to @xmath1 environmental modes ; as they showed , the mapping to an oscillator bath can only be made rigourously _ if the coupling is weak_. oscillator models are thus best adapted to @xmath1 _ delocalised _ environmental modes ( where the coupling is automatically @xmath6 , and thus small for large @xmath1 ) .",
    "however , readers familiar with low - temperature physics will know that at low energies , the entropy and heat capacity of almost all real physical systems are dominated instead by _ local _ modes such as defects , impurity spins , and nuclear spins @xcite .",
    "typically these relax very slowly at low @xmath0 because little phase space is available in their coupling to any delocalised modes ( or to each other )",
    ". however they often couple strongly to any mesoscopic or macroscopic collective coordinate , which then easily perturbs them .",
    "this coupling is of course _ independent _ of @xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately , even though spin bath models have been studied sporadically for many years @xcite , the results have often been misleading , either because they treat some weak - coupling limit ( sometimes made @xcite by arbitrarily multiplying the coupling to each of the @xmath1 bath spins by a factor @xmath7 , for no good physical reason ) , or because they drop some of the important couplings to the bath spins , in order to solve the model . in the weak - coupling limit",
    ", spin bath models can be mapped to oscillator baths @xcite ( in accordance with the original remarks of feynman and vernon @xcite ) .",
    "however one is often nowhere near the weak - coupling limit , and the mapping to the oscillator bath then _ fails _ in general @xcite .",
    "this demands a new approach , which is the subject of this review .",
    "it may be useful to mention _ why _ many physicists are interested in models of this kind . here",
    "are some of the reasons :    \\(i ) very rapid progress in work on intrinsically quantum processes ( interference , tunneling , etc . ) occurring at the nanoscopic and mesoscopic scales @xcite , plus speculations about the coming `` nanotechnological revolution '' .",
    "perhaps the most exciting idea in this area is that of making `` quantum computers '' using nanoscopic superconductors @xcite , semiconductors @xcite , or nanomagnets . needless to say , the technological repercussions of this work will be enormous , provided the crucial problem of decoherence can be overcome .",
    "\\(ii ) physicists need to understand the mechanisms of decoherence and quantum dissipation @xcite in nature , and the crossover to ( or `` emergence '' of ) classical behaviour from quantum physics as either size , temperature @xmath0 , external fields , or couplings to the environment are increased .",
    "these issues are not only relevant to quantum device design , but also to problems in quantum gravity , and to the infamous `` quantum measurement '' problem @xcite .",
    "the existence of low-@xmath0 canonical models , going beyond the phenomenology of stochastic or master equations @xcite to work with closed hamiltonians , is invaluable here .",
    "recent examples include the analysis of quantum spin glass relaxation @xcite , quantum relaxation in nanomagnets @xcite and tunneling superconductors @xcite ) , and the study of quantum chaotic systems , stochastic resonance @xcite and dissipative tunneling in ac fields @xcite .",
    "earlier such models have been used for decades to discuss relaxation in fields like quantum chemistry @xcite or nuclear physics .",
    "\\(iii ) both oscillator and spin bath models map to many important models in quantum field theory .",
    "thus the `` spin - boson '' model mentioned above @xcite maps , for specific parameter values , to the kondo model , the thirring and sine - gordon models , and various other 2-dimensional field theories .",
    "although similar mappings have yet to be exploited in great detail for the spin bath , they will obviously be very useful for , eg . , lattice spin models .",
    "most work in these areas has used oscillator bath representations of the environment , with the tacit assumption that delocalised environmental modes dominate the physics .",
    "however , experiments on quantum nanomagnetic systems @xcite , on glasses @xcite , and on mesoscopic conductors @xcite , as well as theoretical debate about the mechanisms of decoherence in nature , clearly require a more general point of view .",
    "in fact we shall see that spin baths behave very differently from oscillator baths .",
    "for example , the oft - discussed connection between dissipation and decoherence which exists for oscillator bath environments @xcite is absent here- one can even have decoherence with no dissipation at all @xcite , because of the quantum phase associated with the spin bath dynamics .",
    "although the existence of a quantum phase associated with spin is obvious ( it is a quantum variable ) , it was not until haldane @xcite and berry @xcite discussed its topological properties that physicists realised its practical importance , in terms of the path traced out on the spin sphere .",
    "just as in the usual aharonov - bohm effect , the `` flux '' enclosed by a path ( given here by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the spin and @xmath10 is the enclosed solid angle on the unit spin sphere ) is equal to a dynamical phase- but now these are both in _ spin space _ , not in real space .",
    "these ideas ( and related experiments ) were the centre of enormous interest in the mid - late 1980 s , in almost all fields of physics ( and were extensively reviewed then @xcite ) .",
    "in this article we will be interested in the spin phase of the _ environment_. we stress here that the environmental `` spin '' variables may not necessarily refer to real spins ( they can describe defects , or other such `` 2 level systems '' ) , but they will still have an associated dynamic topological phase , which can be described by an effective spin bath variable . the environmental spin phase interacts with the phase of the central system , causing phase decoherence in its dynamics @xcite . from the point of view of measurement theory , this environmental phase decoherence comes from a `` phase measurement '' made by the spin environment @xcite , in a kind of `` inverse stern - gerlach '' setup ( where the spins , instead of being measured , are themselves doing the measuring ! ) .",
    "such phase decoherence also arises from oscillator baths , in a rather different ( and much less effective ) way @xcite .",
    "in fact , the relevant phases involve both an adiabatic `` berry '' term and a second term coming from transitions between different bath states ( section 3.a ) .",
    "there are also other decoherence mechanisms associated with the bath spins , coming from both the temporal fluctuations of the bias on the central system caused by the spin bath ( section 3.d ) , and from the precession of the spins in the spin bath ( with their associated phase ) _ in between _ transitions of the central system ( section 3.c ) .",
    "thus the question of how the bath spin dynamics influences the central system is not simply a question of looking at berry phases .",
    "practical application of the theory to , eg . ,",
    "squids , or nanomagnets , or `` qubits '' ( section 5 ) , must include all mechanisms properly ( section 3.e ) .",
    "the tactic adopted in this article is to focus on a `` central spin '' model @xcite ( sections 3 and 4 ) , in which the role of each term is exposed rather clearly ; after this one sees how things generalise to other models .",
    "this model is directly relevant to qubits , and to the observation of mesoscopic or `` macroscopic '' quantum coherence- indeed we maintain that any practical design of such devices must involve the elimination , by one means or another , of _ all _ decoherence mechanisms from the relevant spin bath @xcite .",
    "we begin the article ( section 2 ) by showing how both oscillator and spin bath models arise as the low - energy truncated versions of higher energy hamiltonians .",
    "we give several examples , both magnetic and superconducting , to illustrate this .",
    "then , in section 3 we explain how , mathematically , one averages over the spin bath variables to find the behaviour of the central system .",
    "this is done pedagogically- we use the example of the central spin model ( and compare it with the spin - boson model ) .",
    "various simple limits are introduced , and solved , before the general technique is given at the end of section 3 . in section 4",
    "we give some results @xcite for the dynamics of the central spin model , in various regimes , to show how the physics is influenced by the spin bath ; and we also show how the system reduces to the spin - boson system in the weak - coupling limit . for those readers interested in the mathematical details , these are sketched in 2 appendices .",
    "finally , in section 5 we return to physical applications , particularly to quantum magnetic systems and superconductors .",
    "we then discuss decoherence , and show how this should persist even in the @xmath3 limit .",
    "we finish by discussing the important application of the central spin model to decoherence in qubits and in quantum computation .",
    "in studying the low - energy dynamics of a central quantum system coupled to an environment , we begin by  truncating out \" the unwanted high - energy physics , to produce a low - energy effective hamiltonian .",
    "this is of course a quite general technique in physics , and one way to approach it is illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "typically one has a reasonably accurately known ",
    "high - energy \" or ",
    "bare \" hamiltonian ( or lagrangian ) for a quantum system , valid below some  ultraviolet \" upper energy cut - off energy @xmath11 , and having the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an @xmath14-dimensional coordinate describing that part of the system we are interested in ( with @xmath15 the corresponding conjugate momentum ) , and @xmath16 are @xmath17-dimensional coordinates describing all other degrees of freedom which may couple to @xmath18 .",
    "conventionally one refers to @xmath16 as environmental coordinates .",
    "@xmath19 is of course a low - energy form of some other even higher - energy hamiltonian , in a chain extending ultimately back to quarks , leptons , and perhaps strings .",
    "if , however , one is only interested in physics below a much lower energy scale @xmath20 , then the question is - can we find a new effective hamiltonian , of form @xmath21 in the truncated hilbert space of energies below @xmath20 ?",
    "in this @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are generalised @xmath25-dimensional coordinates of interest , and @xmath26 are @xmath1-dimensional environmental coordinates coupled to them .",
    "since we have truncated the total hilbert space , we have in general that @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "why do we make this truncation ( after all , its inevitable effect will be to generate new couplings between the low - energy modes ) ? essentially because in many cases the truncation pushes the new @xmath22 towards some low - energy ",
    "fixed point \" hamiltonian ; and many different physical systems may flow to the same fixed point .",
    "this allows us to speak of  universality classes `` of quantum environment , and of a small number of ' ' canonical `` effective hamiltonians .",
    "all physical systems in the same universality class will be described by the same form for @xmath29 , albeit with different values for the couplings .",
    "as one varies the uv cut - off @xmath20 , the couplings change and any given system moves in the ' ' coupling `` or ' ' effective hamiltonian \" space ; but they all move towards the same fixed point ( or fixed line , in some cases ) as @xmath30 is reduced . the various coupling terms in @xmath31 , simply parametrise the path it takes as @xmath32 ( fig.1 ) .",

    "@xcite for comparision of spin and oscillator bath systems , and @xcite for specific examples . in this article",
    "we will go directly to the canonical models , giving some examples of each so that readers can see how the high - energy hamiltonians are related to the models for some real systems .",
    "to warm up we recall the basic structure of the oscillator bath effective hamiltonians , and then move on immediately to discuss various canonical models involving spin baths .      for models in the general `` universality class '' of oscillator bath environments",

    "we have introduced a topological phase @xmath52 for the central system , which depends in general on an external field ; the simplest and best - known example is a form @xmath53 , arising from the interference between 2 paths of amplitude @xmath54 in the motion of the central system .",

    "this form is not the most general one- apart from dropping external field effects ( for which see below ) we have also restricted the central spin phase in a simple @xmath174 form ( _ cf_. introduction ) .",
    "as discussed below , both @xmath175 and @xmath176 incorporate spin bath renormalisation effects .",
    "the factor of 2 in front of @xmath175 is somewhat arbitrary ( if the cosine is one , then the actual `` tunnel splitting '' coming from ( [ 1.24 ] ) , in the absence of spin bath effects , will be @xmath177 ) .",
    "the basic form of ( [ 1.24 ] ) is actually fairly easy to understand .",
    "the extra phase in the first `` non - diagonal '' term ( adding to @xmath176 ) comes from the topological phase of the bath spins as they make transitions @xcite .",
    "there are also diagonal terms , and a weak interaction @xmath178 between the bath spins .",

    "the ratio @xmath182 is arbitrary . in sections 4 and 5",
    "we shall see there is a weak coupling limit to this model , in which it reduces to a spin - boson system .",
    "before this model was derived in this general form and then solved , a number of special cases had already been looked at @xcite . in particular , shimshoni and",
    "gefen @xcite included only the diagonal terms @xmath183 and @xmath184 , and examined the results in weak coupling in the presence of an ac field ( see also @xcite ) ; they clearly recognised that the problem was different from an oscillator bath one .",
    "let us now discuss the different terms in ( [ 1.24 ] ) , in the order they appear ( cf . fig .",
    "\\(i ) _ non - diagonal terms _ : that an extra phase term should exist , coming from the spin bath , is obvious on general grounds ( cf .",
    "introduction ) .",
    "one can understand its algebraic form in the following way .",
    "notice that @xmath185 in ( [ 1.24 ] ) operates on both the central spin _ and _ the spin bath ; and the effect of a single giant spin transition on @xmath186 can always be written as a transition between initial and final nuclear states , in the form @xmath187 , where @xmath188 } \\label{chi.2}\\ ] ] the integral over @xmath189 is only defined once we know the trajectory of the central system during the tunneling event .",
    "it is in this sense that we say @xcite that the instanton has become an `` operator '' in the space of the spin bath modes .",
    "notice that in general the central spin phase @xmath176 and splitting @xmath190 are renormalised by the bath couplings @xcite : @xmath191 the @xmath192 are `` berry phase '' terms coming from the bath spin dynamics during a central spin flip , and the @xmath193 come from high - frequency modifications of the original high - energy potential ( `` barrier fluctuations '' ) .",
    "one can show that both @xmath194 and @xmath195 are @xmath196 , where @xmath197 is the larger of @xmath179 , and we will ignore these terms from now on .",
    "expanding out the cosine in ( [ 1.24 ] ) gives a series of terms like @xmath198 in which the instanton flip of the central spin couples simultaneously to many _ different _ bath spins- a single central spin transition can cause multiple transitions in the bath ( fig .",
    "2 ) . later we will introduce a parameter @xmath199 which measures the average number of bath spins flipping during each instanton .",
    "\\(ii ) _ diagonal terms _ : these act _ between _ transitions of the central spin ( fig . 2 ) , and are also easy to understand . formally ,",
    "one starts by considering the `` initial '' and `` final '' fields ( ie .",
    ", before and after a transition of @xmath172 ) acting on @xmath200 .",
    "calling these fields @xmath201 and @xmath202 respectively ( fig .",
    "3 ) , we define the _ sum _ and the _ difference _ terms as @xmath203 where @xmath204 and @xmath205 are unit vectors . then the truncated diagonal interaction takes the form @xmath206",
    "i.e. , one term which changes during a transition of the central system , and one which does not .    the longitudinal coupling @xmath207 determines the gross structure of the bath states in energy space : it also determines an `` internal bias field '' @xmath208 acting on @xmath209 .",
    "the 2 levels of bath spin @xmath210 are split by energy @xmath183 , depending on whether @xmath211 is parallel or antiparallel to @xmath209 .",
    "the effect of this on the @xmath212 fold multiplet of bath states surrounding each central spin state is shown in fig .",
    "4 . suppose we classify these states by their `` polarisation group '' ; all bath states whose total longitudinal polarisation @xmath213 are in polarisation group @xmath214 .",
    "since the @xmath183 vary from one bath spin to another , states in polarisation group @xmath214 are spread over an energy range @xmath215 ; and the entire manifold of states , comprising all polarisation groups , is spread over a larger energy range @xmath216 .",
    "let us define _ normalised _ densities of states @xmath217 and @xmath218 for these 2 distributions , so that @xmath219 where @xmath220 . in almost any physical case one will have strongly overlapping polarisation groups , so that for all but very small values of @xmath1 , or except in the extreme wings of the distributions , one has @xmath221 @xmath222",

    "where @xmath230 , @xmath218 can no longer be treated as gaussian- however there is an intrinsic lower limit to the linewidth of each polarisation group set by the interspin interaction @xmath178 .",
    "this `` intrinsic linewidth '' @xmath231 , where @xmath100 is a typical value of @xmath178 ; in any physically realistic case this is usually enough by itself to cause complete overlap of all groups ( the essentially non - interacting case where @xmath232 , ie .",
    ", @xmath233 for all bath spins , and @xmath234 , was actually studied by garg @xcite ) .",
    "the `` transverse '' couplings @xmath184 arise when the fields before/ after a transition , acting on the @xmath235 , are not exactly parallel or antiparallel .",
    "this can happen in many ways , either because of external fields which couple to the bath spins , or because of a lack of symmetry in the underlying dynamics of the central system , or in its coupling to the bath modes .",
    "thus they are non - zero in any realistic situation .",
    "\\(iii ) _ internal spin bath dynamics _ : finally , the interaction @xmath178 is usually so weak that it does not change under truncation .",
    "if this term is absent , the spin bath will have no `` intrinsic '' dynamics , and remains inert between transitions of @xmath172 .",
    "thus even if small , @xmath178 is important , since it allows the bath state to evolve during these intervals .",
    "the most important effect of @xmath178 is that it allows the longitudinal bias field @xmath236 to fluctuate in time , between and during transitions of @xmath172 .",
    "notice , however , that with the hamiltonian in the form ( [ 1.24 ] ) , _ only fluctuations within the same polarisation group are allowed_. in nmr language , only @xmath237 processes occur in the intrinsic dynamics of the spin bath- changes in @xmath214 can only occur via the interaction with the central spin .",
    "this will only be true at low @xmath0- at higher @xmath0 longitudinal relaxation ( ie .",
    ", `` @xmath238 processes '' , in nmr language ) between different polarisation groups should be included in a realistic model . such processes ( which arise from the interaction of the spin bath modes with other environmental modes , or with thermally excited higher modes of the central system , above the uv cutoff energy @xmath20 ) are almost always very slow when @xmath239 .",
    "on the other hand @xmath237 fluctuations will persist until @xmath240 ; in the physical examples studied so far this means they persist down to @xmath241 temperatures or below .",

    "to extract useful information from the low - energy canonical models , we must calculate their dynamical properties .",

    "the correlation properties of @xmath479 are those just described- our task is simply to functionally average over these fluctuations in the calculation of @xmath345 . in doing this",
    "we will make the physically sensible assumption of `` fast diffusion '' of @xmath479 , such that the time @xmath480 it takes for the bias to diffuse across the `` resonance window '' , of energy width @xmath190 , satisfies @xmath481 .",
    "then the system has no time to tunnel coherently , but can only make an incoherent `` landau - zener '' transition . since the bias changes by @xmath482 in a time @xmath483 , this formally requires that @xmath484 this problem is solved in appendix a , by performing a _ weighted average over dynamic bias fluctuations _ , with the restriction that these only occur inside polarisation group @xmath214 ; the relevant average is @xmath485 where @xmath486 is the correlator of the dynamic spin bath fluctuations ( see appendix a ) .",

    "we see that the important role of the bath dynamics is ( i ) to _ unblock _ the central spin dynamics , by helping it to find resonance , now over an energy window of width @xmath490 ( instead of @xmath321 ) around zero bias ( recall fig .",

    "second , ( [ jltp.446 ] ) should not be applied uncritically to experiments , even on single quantum systems .",
    "this is because in a real experiment there will also be ( i ) couplings to oscillator baths , and ( ii ) the relaxation will change once @xmath614 . in superconductors or metals , electronic oscillator baths will often dominate the relaxation @xcite , even at short times ( for their effect on _ coherence _ , see section 5.c below ) . even in insulating systems ,",
    "one eventually expects the coupling to phonons to take over at long times @xcite , since this causes exponential decay- even if very slow , this will eventually become faster than the spin bath - mediated logarithmic decay in ( [ jltp.446 ] ) .",

    "the weak - coupling regime is thus defined by the condition @xmath615 , ie . , both @xmath184 _ and _ @xmath183 are @xmath616 . again , a variety of cases is possible depending on how large are ratios like @xmath617 and @xmath618 , or parameters like @xmath199 and @xmath437 . in the following",

    "an understanding of decoherence mechanisms is central to the exploitation of mesoscopic systems in quantum devices , as well as to general questions about how quantum mechanics applies on the large scale , @xcite , and the quantum measurement problem @xcite .",
    "it has become particularly important now that efforts are being made to construct `` qubit '' devices , with a view to making quantum computers .",
    "the last 15 years have seen a total transformation in how such questions are discussed- instead of vague analyses in terms of `` measurements '' by the environment , we now have precise and generally applicable models , which can be tested in many experiments .",
    "the basic issues are ( i ) whether phase coherence can be preserved in the reduced density matrix of the system of interest and ( ii ) what are the decoherence mechanisms destroying it . here",

    "almost all microscopic analyses of this problem have assumed environments of electronic excitations which can be mapped onto oscillator baths ( see , eg . , @xcite ) .",
    "in our opinion , as discussed in section 4.b , the basic problem is simply that the main source of decoherence in most systems ( including squids ) at low @xmath0 will not be any oscillator bath , but the spin bath of paramagnetic and nuclear spins . as discussed in section 2.g and 4.b , the low - energy scale of this spin bath means it will not usually have a big effect on squid tunneling , but its effect on macroscopic coherence or on superconducting qubits will be rather large .",
    "although a superconducting qubit has not yet been built , experiments may be getting rather close @xcite . to see how big spin bath effects on coherence might be , let us recall that the effect of paramagnetic impurities is to create a gaussian multiplet of spin bath states of width @xmath725 in energy for a squid containing a total of @xmath726 paramagnetic impurities interacting with the supercurrent , where @xmath727 is the change in field on each paramagnetic impurity caused by the change in flux state of the squid . to see coherence it is necessary , from the discussion of section 4.b , that @xmath728 , because the decoherence time coming from the spin bath is @xmath729 ; this essentially sets a lower bound for @xmath321 .",
    "as discussed in some detail in a recent paper @xcite , this turns out to be a rather stringent requirement on real squids ; in fact in the experiments of the lukens group @xcite one infers a value @xmath730 from their resonant linewidths .",
    "obviously this value could be reduced a great deal by careful attention to the nuclear and paramgnetic spin impurity composition in the system ( as well as to the sample geometry ) .",
    "\\(ii ) _ decoherence in magnets _ : the most dramatic claims for the observation of macroscopic coherence have been made by awschalom et al .",
    "@xcite , working on randomly oriented dilute ensembles of ferritin macromolecules ( which order antiferromagnetically , but carry an excess moment of somewhat random size ; the antiferromagnetic `` nel '' moment is @xmath731 ) . in an effort to make the molecule size as uniform as possible , these authors filtered them magnetically .",
    "they also artificially engineered molecules of smaller size .",
    "the essential result was the observation of an absorption peak at @xmath732 frequencies , whose frequency varies approximately exponentially with the size of the molecules .",

    "there have been widespread objections to this interpretation , both on theoretical and experimental grounds @xcite , and so far no other group has succeeded in confirming the experiments .",
    "note that the awschalom group saw similar resonances ( also with an exponential dependence of resonant frequency on size ) in large feco@xmath733 particles , but did _ not _ attribute this to tunneling @xcite .    as we discussed in the previous sub - section",
    ", there is now very extensive evidence that nanomagnetic molecules in macroscopically ordered crystals tunnel _",
    "incoherently _ in the low-@xmath0 quantum regime @xcite .",
    "there is thus an apparent contradiction between the ferritin work and that done in the mn-12 and fe-8 systems ( particularly since the ferritin molecules are much larger and certainly contain a lot of spin disorder ) .",
    "thus in the very well - characterised @xmath136 - 8 molecular crystals used by the florence and grenoble groups , the parameter @xmath437 characterising decoherence from the orthogonality blocking mechanism varies @xcite , even in an ideal sample , between @xmath734 in zero applied field ( depending on the annealing - dependent spread @xmath735 in the intermolecular dipolar fields ) , to @xmath736 when @xmath737 ( where the first zero in @xmath190 is supposed to occur @xcite ) .",
    "recalling from sections 3.c and 4.a that coherence is practically eliminated unless @xmath446 , it is hard to see how experiments on these particular molecules in low fields will stand much chance of seeing it .",
    "on the other hand it is clear that future experiments on _ single _ nanomagnets in the quantum regime might have a chance of seeing coherence _",
    "_ one could raise @xmath321 to values @xmath738 the hyperfine couplings @xmath197 ( presumably using a large external transverse field ) , thereby making @xmath446 and so removing decoherence ( and also reducing the problem to a straightforward spin - boson model- see section 4.b ) .",

    "\\(iii ) _ decoherence as _ @xmath3 : let us now consider the general question of decoherence effects at low @xmath0 .",
    "decoherence is often ( particularly in conductors ) characterised by a `` decoherence time '' @xmath714 , for the phase dynamics of the degree of freedom of interest . if and when @xmath714 is meaningful , it may be much shorter than the energy relaxation time @xmath742 ( _ cf . _ the example of a single oscillator coupled to an oscillator bath @xcite , or the examples of topological decoherence given for the spin bath in sections 3.a and 4.a above ) ) .",
    "coherence exists if @xmath743 , where @xmath321 is the characteristic frequency of the system s phase dynamics .",
    "notice that what allows us to discuss this problem with any generality at all is the assumption , discussed in sections 1 and 2 , that a few canonical models describe the low-@xmath0 behaviour of most physical systems .",
    "extensive study of the relevant canonical oscillator bath models ( in particular , the spin - boson model @xcite and the `` oscillator on oscillators '' model @xcite ) show that with a power - law form @xmath744 , decoherence disappears as @xmath170 for @xmath745 ; for the ohmic form @xmath746 decoherence is finite at @xmath747 , but can be made small if @xmath748 .",
    "if the electronic spectrum is gapped the ohmic dissipation falls off exponentially in the low @xmath0 limit ( thus for superconductors @xcite one has @xmath749 for @xmath750 , and for magnetic solitons @xcite one has @xmath751 for @xmath752 , where @xmath753 and @xmath754 are the bcs and magnon gaps respectively ) .",
    "thus , if one believes the oscillator bath models , coherence ought to be easily observable at low @xmath0 ; the condition @xmath755 is clearly satisfied for temperatures well below the gap energy .    if we examine the canonical spin bath models we find a very different story @xcite .",
    "consider first the central spin model as @xmath3 ; we will go to such a low temperature that all of the spins in the spin bath order in the field of the central spin ( ie .",
    ", @xmath756 in some cases ) , ie .",
    ", all intrinsic fluctuational dynamics of the bath is frozen out .",
    "does decoherence disappear ?",
    "no , because the mechanisms of topological decoherence ( induced bath spin flip ) and orthogonality blocking ( precession of the bath spins in between central spin flips ) still exist- the bath can still acquire dynamics from the central spin . we emphasize here that this physics can not be described by an oscillator bath model . from the results in section 4 we see",
    "there is a residual constant decoherence as @xmath3 , coming from the spin bath , which in an experiment would be signalled by a saturation of @xmath714 once oscillator bath effects had disappeared .",
    "the extent of this decoherence is characterised by the behaviour of @xmath459 , ( cf . section 4.a ) , and we saw that unless both @xmath437 and @xmath199 were @xmath757 , decoherence was strong . in the case where all bath spins are polarised by the central spin ,",
    "transitions are blocked anyway- there are no spins in the @xmath445 polarisation group !    we conclude that for any system described by the central spin model ( ie . , where the central system reduces to a 2-level system at low energies ) , a general consequence of the coupling to a spin bath will be a loss of coherence , via either the topological decoherence or orthogonality blocking mechanisms , even in the @xmath3 limit . the residual coherence ( if any ) will depend on the strength of the couplings to the spin bath , in a way discussed quantitatively in sections 4 and 5 .",

    "these results show that the naive inference of ballistic propagation from the second moment result is wrong- in reality one has strongly anomalous diffusion ( with an energy - dependent diffusion coefficient , demonstrated by the @xmath778-dependence of the results ) .",

    "similar results apply for the orthogonality- blocked case as a function of @xmath437 .",

    "it is clear that if @xmath569 for all spins , _ and _ provided there are no non - diagonal momentum couplings to the bath , we can not get decoherence by the same mechanism as above , since there is only one state in the relevant polarisation group- the particle will then move freely without disturbing the spins in any way .",
    "however in any other case phase will be exchanged with the bath in the same way as above , with or without dissipation ( which will certainly arise in the weak - coupling limit @xmath786 ) .",

    "the first simply ignores decoherence ( apart from occasionally referring to it as the main stumbling block preventing the construction of a quantum computer ! ) , whereas the second regards decoherence as the crucial problem , and either tries to treat it theoretically ( eg . , @xcite ) or maintains that a quantum computer will never be built because of it ( eg . , @xcite ) .",

    "<S> the quantum dynamics of mesoscopic or macroscopic systems is always complicated by their coupling to many `` environmental '' modes . at low @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> these environmental effects are dominated by </S>",
    "<S> _ localised _ </S>",
    "<S> modes , such as nuclear and paramagnetic spins , and defects ( which also dominate the entropy and specific heat ) . </S>",
    "<S> this environment , at low energies , maps onto a `` spin bath '' model . </S>",
    "<S> this contrasts with `` oscillator bath '' models ( originated by feynman and vernon ) which describe _ delocalised _ environmental modes such as electrons , phonons , photons , magnons , etc . </S>",
    "<S> the couplings to @xmath1 spin bath modes are _ independent _ of @xmath1 ( rather than the @xmath2 dependence typical of oscillator baths ) , and often strong . </S>",
    "<S> one can not in generalmap a spin bath to an oscillator bath ( or vice - versa ) ; they constitute distinct `` universality classes '' of quantum environment .    </S>",
    "<S> we show how the mapping to spin bath models is made , and then discuss several examples in detail , including moving particles , magnetic solitons , nanomagnets , and squids , coupled to nuclear and paramagnetic spin environments .    </S>",
    "<S> we then focus on the `` central spin '' model , which couples a central 2-level system to a background spin bath . </S>",
    "<S> it is the spin bath analogue of the famous `` spin - boson '' oscillator model , and describes , eg . , the tunneling dynamics of nanoscopic and mesoscopic magnets and superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> we show how to average over ( or `` integrate out '' ) spin bath modes , using an operator instanton technique , to find the central spin dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the formal manouevres involve 4 separate averages- each average corresponds physically to a different `` decoherence '' mechanism acting on the central spin dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> each environmental spin has its own topological `` spin phase '' , which by interacting with the phase of the central system , decoheres it- this can happen even without dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> we give analytic results for the central spin correlation functions , under various conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> we then describe the application of this theory to magnetic and superconducting systems . </S>",
    "<S> particular attention is given to recent work on tunneling magnetic macromolecules , where the role of the nuclear spin bath in controlling the tunneling is very clear ; we also discuss other magnetic systems in the quantum regime , and the influence of nuclear and paramagnetic spins on flux dynamics in squids .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss decoherence mechanisms and coherence experiments in superconductors and magnets . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a spin bath environment causes decoherence even in the @xmath3 limit . </S>",
    "<S> control of this decoherence will be essential in the effort to construct `` qubits '' for quantum computers . </S>"
