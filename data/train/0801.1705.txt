    "the dna molecule is the basic genetic material . the ability of dna to pack and fold into chromosomes or to serve as a template during transcription and replication depends on the particular elastic properties of the molecule as modified by local interactions . attribute to the rapid development of the technique of directly manipulating single molecule@xcite , measurement of elastic properties of single dna molecule under stretching or twisting becomes possible recently .",
    "an interesting new phenomena revealed by experiments is that there exists a new state , called s - state which exhibits exotic elastic properties distinguished from the b state .",
    "the dsdna molecule can be extended to almost as twice as its original length before transits to the new state .",
    "there is a sharp transition between the b - state and the s - state , which shows an evidence of high level of cooperativity of molecules in the dsdna .",
    "authors have argued that there must be unknowing dsdna molecular configuration corresponding to the structural transition .",
    "references@xcite provided valuable insights",
    ". however , discrepancy ( for example , untwisted or helical ) still exists .",
    "several models were proposed to fit data of the dsdna molecule response to external force .",
    "the freely jointed chain ( fjc ) model treats dsdna simply as a polymer joined freely by rigid units and neglect the base - stacking interaction between two adjoint base pairs .",
    "it fits the data at low force limit well for dna molecule .",
    "however , the fjc model can not be used to describe the behavior of dsdna molecule which subjected to stretching and twisting simultaneously .",
    "it is well - known that twisting also plays an important role during the structural transition process of dsdna molecule . from a biological point of view",
    ", torsional stress is indeed popular in the living cell and may strongly influence dsdna functioning .",
    "the phenomenological model@xcite , which takes stretching and twisting both into account , describes every state with five independent parameters and trends no phase transition occurred in the course of stretching and twisting .    in this paper , we present an ashkin - teller like model to describe the elastic response of dsdna molecule in a unified framework ( various states with the same parameter ) and try to find the structural transition mechanism of dsdna molecule .",
    "the fjc model describes dsdna molecule simply as joined rigid units . while stretching one end of the molecule along the direction of the strand and fixing another end",
    ", one can deduce a force - extension relation@xcite as    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is effective unit persistent length and @xmath3 is displacement of dsdna molecule along the strand under external force @xmath4 .",
    "it is well - known that dsdna is a double - stranded linear biopolymer , each strand is a covalently linked chain of nucleotides .",
    "nucleotides come in four varieties and are composed of three distinct parts : a sugar called deoxyribose , a phosphate group , and one of four units , adenine , guanine , thymine , and cytosine called bases .",
    "each of the four bases attached to nucleotides is hydrophobic and capable of hydrogen - bonding with another complementary base .",
    "each arm of the dsdna is formed , in turn , by a covalent bond between the phosphate group of one nucleotide and the hydroxyl group of its neighbor nucleotide s sugar .",
    "the bond is often referred to as the phosphodiester bond and the two arms collectively build up the dna backbone .",
    "this classical b - dna structure is the basic dsdna conformation found inside living cells .",
    "now , it is generally accepted that contribution from base - stacking is the main reason help to form steady two strand helix configuration , and it also determines the dsdna s local transformation .",
    "unfortunately , the precise picture about base - stacking is still unknown .",
    "the fjc model treats the dsdna molecule composed of two interacting strands simply as the freely joined rigid units and neglects the interaction between two adjoint bases ( base - stacking ) .",
    "it is suspected reasonably that it fails to describe high force extension and can not take the torque effect into account . here , we suggest an ashkin - teller like model ( based on the ashkin - teller model@xcite in statistical mechanics ) to describe in a uniform way the elastic response of dna molecule to both external force and torque .",
    "the hamiltonian of the ashkin - teller like model with external force ( @xmath4 ) and torque ( @xmath5 ) is of the form    @xmath6 , \\label{h}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are 1-dimension unit orientation vectors ( takes values of @xmath9 ) .",
    "@xmath10 describes the strength of base - stacking interaction between two adjoint base pairs . in the case of @xmath11 ,",
    "the model reduces to two decoupled chains . @xmath12 and @xmath13 are constant parameters .",
    "it is obvious that the strength of base - stacking interaction depends on structure of dna molecule as well as external conditions in which the dna is studied . in general case of the dna molecule under stretching and twisting , we give a simple phenomenological describing of the base - stacking interaction strength as    @xmath14    where @xmath5 denotes the supercoiling degree defined as @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the linking number of the two strands whose value is the sum of the twist and the writhe , @xmath17 is the linking number of two strains in natural state .",
    "the average unit bending persistence length can be calculated by the formula    @xmath18 \\langle s+\\tau\\rangle=\\displaystyle\\frac{\\displaystyle\\sum_{s_i,\\tau_i=\\pm 1}(s_j+\\tau_j ) e^{-\\beta e_i}}{z}~ , \\label{m1 } \\end{array}\\ ] ]    where @xmath2 is the unit physical bending persistence length ( takes the value of @xmath19 nm per base pair ) , and @xmath3 denotes the partition function of dna molecule    @xmath20    . stretching and twisting .",

    "other parameters are selected as : @xmath23 m ( from ref.@xcite ) , @xmath24 nm , @xmath25 and @xmath19 nm as physical length per base pair . ]    the total relative extension of dsdna molecule under stretching and twisting can be obtained    @xmath26    in fig .",
    "3 , we present a plot of the relative extension of dsdna molecule @xmath27 . stretching and twisting .",
    "the surfacegraphics demonstrates clearly that the ashkin - teller like model describes well the elastic response of dsdna molecule under both stretching and twisting simultaneously with same parameters for the b and s state when the dna molecule stretched over its contour length .",
    "3 exhibits three distinct dna states ( corresponding to different elastic property ) and transitions among them induced by external stretching .",
    "furthermore , it reveals quantitatively that the transition between b - form to s - state is influenced greatly by external twisting . with the supercoiling @xmath5 increasing from negatively to positively supercoiled ,",
    "the transition from the b form to the s - state needs larger external force and the cooperative transition becomes more sharpened .",
    "this is in agreement quantitatively with experiments .        to further investigate the relative extension of the dna molecule under stretching with fixed twisting and to compare with the experiment data@xcite , we present the force - extension curves with fixed supercoiling @xmath5 in fig .",
    "it is in good agreement with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "the model gives also the asymmetric behavior of the relative extension of the dsdna molecule between negatively supercoiled and positively supercoiled region ( see fig .",
    "5 ) .        at the region of negatively supercoiled",
    ", the elastic response of dsdna behaves differently for different twisting while keeping force a constant .",
    "however , when @xmath5 rises up to about @xmath28 , all curves get - together and have no difference in the course of @xmath5 increasing continuously .",
    "these results indicate that twisting have much more influence on negatively supercoiled dsdna than on positively supercoiled one .",
    "the realistic significance of the exotic behavior for dsdna molecule is that , in the living , cell dsdna is usually negatively supercoiled ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "experiments@xcite really showed asymmetric behavior of elastic response of dsdna molecule when external force is under @xmath30 pn and the stretched dsdna molecule is smaller than its contour length .",
    "our model reveals that the same property still exists after dsdna molecule is stretched over its contour length .",
    "we wish more elaborate experiments should check the validity of the prediction .",
    "relative extension under external force(in the case of @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    ", torsion free ) . while the dsdna molecule is stretched to its contour length , the folding angle has value @xmath33 , which is in good agreement with the realistic structure of dsdna ( with @xmath34 ) . ]",
    "@xcite postulated that dsdna structure should be extremely important to its elastic properties and introduced a structural parameter : the folding angle @xmath35 , which describes the angle between one of dsdna backbones and central axis . in the ashkin - teller like model , value of folding angle",
    "can also be obtained    @xmath36    fig .",
    "6 demonstrates that the elastic behaviors of dsdna molecule under external force are really closely related to its structure and the postulation @xcite is verified .",
    "as shown above , the ashkin - teller like model describes well the elastic behavior of dsdna molecule .",
    "the base - stacking interaction between the double stranded structure is represented by the strength of `` four site '' interaction @xmath10 uniformly . we know that this base - stacking interaction is the main factor maintaining the stable double - helix structure and resulting in configurational transformation . without this interaction",
    "the model reduced to two decoupled chains .",
    "the fact provides possibility of describing elastic response of dsdns and ssdna in a unified frame .     and @xmath37 .",
