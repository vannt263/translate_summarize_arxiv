    "the constitution of the interior of neutron stars is still considered an open question by the scientific community . not only are neutron stars highly dense compact astrophysical objects , the extreme conditions near the center have led to the hypothesis that the core consists entirely of _ quark matter _ , in which the constituent quarks comprising the neutrons become deconfined . moreover , based on the mit bag model , it was first argued explicitly by witten @xcite that the most stable state of matter is _ strange quark matter _ , which is a mixture containing roughly the same number of up , down , and strange quarks .",
    "quark matter is of interest for a number of reasons .",
    "for example , that compact stars could result in a topology change , that is , in the formation of wormholes , had already been suggested in ref .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the topology change inside a neutron star requires a quark - matter core of a certain minimal radius .",
    "the survival of quark nuggets from the early universe is also a possibility . using the mit bag model , it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that quark matter may be a suitable candidate for dark matter .",
    "in fact , a strange star may be regarded as a huge strangelet .    in qcd ,",
    "the interaction between quarks becomes weak for a large exchange of momentum .",
    "so , for a sufficiently large temperature or density , or both , interaction between constituent quarks becomes very weak and , consequently , they become deconfined . in heavy ion collider experiments deconfinement of quarks may be brought about at high temperatures ( @xmath1 180 mev or above ) .",
    "but neutron stars are cold ( @xmath1 few kev ) .",
    "extremely large chemical potential at the core of the neutron star plays the central role for deconfinement of the quarks . at densities of nearly twice nuclear density , hyperons appear in neutron star matter and this state is known as the hadronic phase ( hp ) , whereas a deconfined quark matter phase is obtained as a phase transition from the hadronic phase at densities much higher than the nuclear density .",
    "if the conversion of neutron - star matter to quark matter is not confined to the core , then the result is a _",
    "quark star_. under certain conditions , it is theoretically possible for some up and down quarks to be transformed into strange quarks . since the strange matter is the true ground state of matter , nothing can stop the conversion of the entire quark star into starnge matter once the core gets converted into strange matter .",
    "thus a neutron star gets converted into a strange star . in this paper",
    ", we propose a new deterministic model for strange stars based on the mit bag model .",
    "+ we organize our paper as follows : + in sec ii , we have provided the basic equations . in sec .",
    "iii , we have obtained the solutions of physical parameters . in section iv , we have studied mass - radius relation & surface redshift of the stranger stars . the article is concluded with a short discussion .",
    "to describe the spacetime of the interior of the strange star , we assume the metric to be @xmath2 and then recall that the most general energy momentum tensor compatible with spherically symmetry is @xmath3 with @xmath4    the einstein field equations are listed next .",
    "@xmath5+\\frac{1}{r^2}= 8\\pi \\rho , \\label{eq : lam}\\ ] ] @xmath6-\\frac{1}{r^2}= 8\\pi p_r , \\label{eq : nu}\\ ] ] @xmath7 = 8\\pi p_t .",
    "\\label{eq : tan}\\ ] ] our analysis begins with a set of astrophysical objects considered to be candidates for strange stars .",
    "the masses and radii of these compact objects are listed in table 1 .",
    "the interpolation technique has been used to estimate the cubic polynomial that yield the following expression for the mass as a function of the radial coordinate @xmath8 :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the observed evidence for the existence of strange stars has also led to observed masses and radii .",
    "these observations are used in this paper to obtain an interpolation function @xmath9 , which proved to be an effective model for strange stars .",
    "the subsequent analysis is based on the mit bag model and yields both the radial pressure @xmath10 and the transverse pressure @xmath11 , as well as the energy density of the strange star .",
    "subsequently , @xmath9 was used to show that a mass - radius relation due to buchdahl is satisfied in our model of a strange star . from our results",
    "we can predict some characteristics of a strange star of radius , say 9.9 km .",
    "one can see that we have set @xmath12 in our calculations .",
    "now , if one substitutes @xmath13 and @xmath14 into relevant equations , the value of the surface density of the predicted strange star of radius 9.9 km turns out to be @xmath15   gm  @xmath16 . note that our model can not predict the central density since we can not get the values of the physical parameters less than 6.2 km radius .",
    "also , we can predict the mass of strange star of radius 9.9 km as @xmath17 .",
    "the compactness of the star will be 0.2548 and corresponding redshift is z=0.4285 .",
    "this high redshift is convenient for explaining strange stars .",
    "we can definitely state that our predicted strange star is more compact than neutron stars . in 2008 , cackett et al .",
    "@xcite reported that redshift of a strange star in the low - mass x - ray binary 4u 1820 - 30 is @xmath18 .",
    "this supports our prediction on strange stars in the low - mass x - ray binary 4u 1820 - 30 .",
    "recently , x - ray binaries xte j1739 - 285 were suggested as strange stars @xcite .",
    "we hope our method can be used to determine different characteristics of these strange stars .",

    "however , the maximum mass predicted from the consideration of the existence of hyperons or bosons , is much smaller than the recently discovered compact objects like j1614 - 2230 @xcite or j0348 + 0432 @xcite .",
    "these observations practically rules out the possibility of existence of hyperons , bosons or pure neutrons inside the so called neutron stars . the hadrons inside these stars must get converted to quark or strange quark matter .",
    "so , though these compact star candidates are called neutron stars , the theoretical predictions of qcd confirm the transformation of hadrons to quark or strange quark matter .",
    "hence , from theoretical consideration we are safe to consider these compact objects as strange stars .",
