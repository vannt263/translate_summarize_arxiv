    "besides , due to the inherent curl of the source polarization induced , magnetic - type resonances in nanostructures will inevitably cause generation of magnetic multipoles , whose relative contribution into nonlinear response is usually overshadowed by more pronounced nonlinear dipole and quadrupole in metallic setups .",
