    "although many kinds of superconductors have been discovered , the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 of the cuprate superconductors still remains to be the highest , and the possibility of further enhancing @xmath0 still attracts much attention . to achieve higher @xmath0 ,",
    "it is important to understand the key parameters that control @xmath0 , and from this viewpoint , there have been studies that have focused on the correlation between @xmath0 and the lattice parameters such as the in - plain bond length(@xmath4)@xcite or the apical oxygen height(@xmath5 ) @xcite measured from the cuo@xmath6 planes .",
    "theoretically , we have studied the material dependence of @xmath0 in refs.@xcite , and introduced a two - orbital model that takes into account the @xmath3 and @xmath2 wannier orbitals . in most of the theories of the cuprates , only the @xmath3 ( and the hybridized oxygen @xmath7 ) orbital",
    "is considered , but actually it has been noticed from the early days that in ( la , sr)@xmath6cuo@xmath8 , which has small @xmath5 and relatively low @xmath0 , there is a strong mixture of the @xmath2 orbital component near the fermi level@xcite .",
    "in fact , nowadays there have been more studies that focus on the @xmath2 orbital or the related apical oxygen @xcite . in refs.@xcite",
    ", we have shown that this mixture of the @xmath2 orbital component near the fermi level works destructively against @xmath9wave superconductivity , and hence this is the main reason of the material dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "studying the pressure effect on @xmath0 is an _ in situ _ way of attacking the problem of the correlation between @xmath0 and the lattice structure .",
    "it is well known that in most of the cuprates , application of pressure enhances @xmath0@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has been revealed that the pressure effect exhibits strong anisotropy@xcite . in our recent theoretical study on the pressure effect in the cuprates",
    ", it has been revealed that in addition to the @xmath2 effect , the roundness of the fermi surface , which is controlled by cu-@xmath10-@xmath3 hybridization , and also the band width are important parameters that governs @xmath0 under pressure@xcite .    in the present paper , after briefly reviewing the main results obtained in ref.@xcite , we study more closely the effect of the band width by applying the fluctuation exchange approximation(flex)@xcite to the two - orbital model .",
    "secondly , we will explain the difference of the @xmath2 orbital effect between the multi - layer and single - layer systems under hydrostatic pressure .",
    "we first obtain the crystal structure of the single - layer cuprates la@xmath6cuo@xmath8 and hg@xmath6bacuo@xmath8 under ambient pressure .",
    "namely , we calculate the total energy by first principles calculation@xcite varying the lattice constants , and fit the result by the standard burch - marnaghan formula@xcite to obtain the structure at the most stable point . from such calculation",
    ", we can obtain the crystal structure within one percent discrepancy from the lattice constants determined experimentally@xcite . to obtain the lattice structure under hydrostatic pressure , we optimize the poisson s ratio and atomic position by first principles reducing the cell volume to 95@xmath11 or 90@xmath11 of the lattice structure under ambient pressure . since the compressibility in the cuprates",
    "is known to be about @xmath12 gpa@xmath13@xcite , @xmath14 corresponds to a pressure of about 10 gpa .      using the obtained crystal structure under ambient or hydrostatic pressure , we construct maximally localized wannier orbitals@xcite to extract the hopping parameters of the @xmath3-@xmath2 two - orbital model@xcite . as for the electron - electron interactions , we consider the on - site intraorbital coulomb repulsion @xmath15 , interorbital repulsion @xmath16 , the hund s coupling @xmath17 and the pair - hopping @xmath18 .",
    "here we also keep the orbital su@xmath19 requirement , @xmath20 .",
    "we set @xmath21 ev , @xmath22 ev and @xmath23 ev unless mentioned otherwise .",
    "estimates of @xmath15 for the cuprates is @xmath24 , @xmath25ev ( namely , @xmath15 is about @xmath26 ev ) , and @xmath27 , so the values adopted here are within the widely accepted range .",
    "we apply flex to this model to obtain the green s function renormalized by the many - body self - energy correction . in flex",
    ", we define the spin and charge susceptibilities as follows ;    @xmath28    @xmath29    where @xmath30 , the irreducible susceptibility is @xmath31 with the interaction matrices    @xmath32    @xmath33    here , @xmath34 are orbital indices . considering the self - energy correction originating from these susceptibilities , we solve the dyson equation in a self - consistent manner .",
    "then the renormalized green s function is substituted to the linearized eliashberg equation for superconductivity ,    @xmath35    the maximum eigenvalue @xmath36 in the above equation reaches unity at the superconducting transition temperature @xmath37 , so that @xmath36 calculated at a fixed temperature can be used as a measure for @xmath0 . here , we calculate @xmath36 at @xmath38 ev for la and @xmath39 ev for hg .",
    "the reason for this is because @xmath40 k of hg is about three times larger than for la with @xmath41 k@xcite .",
    "in fig.[hydro ] , @xmath36 is depicted as a function of the unit cell volume .",
    "@xmath36 increases in la and in hg cuprates with hydrostatic pressure , and this agrees with the well - known experimental result that @xmath0 goes up monotonically under pressure in the cuprates@xcite .",
    "to understand this result , we have introduced three important parameters , the level offset @xmath42 , the roundness of fermi surface ( @xmath43 defined below ) and the band width @xmath44@xcite . to decompose the pressure effect into the contribution from the variation of these parameters , we vary each parameter `` by hand '' from the original value at @xmath45 to the value at @xmath14 separately , and calculate the variation in @xmath36 .",
    "this result is also depicted in fig.[hydro ] as the length of arrows .",
    "@xmath42 is the on - site energy difference between @xmath3 and @xmath2 wannier orbitals in the two - orbital model , so this is a measure of the @xmath2 orbital effect , which has been found to work destructively against @xmath1-wave superconductivity in our previous study@xcite . the effect of @xmath42 is dominant in la compound because la originally has small @xmath42 thereby suppressing @xmath0 , so its increase under pressure is effective for the @xmath0 enhancement .",
    "note that in la system , @xmath42 increases under pressure because the absolute magnitude of the crystal field increases in spite of the reduction of @xmath46 . on the other hand ,",
    "in the hg compound the pressure effect through @xmath42 is negligible because @xmath42 is intrinsically large .",
    "instead , the other two parameters are effective .",
    "@xmath43 is defined as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the @xmath49-th neighbor hopping within the @xmath3 orbital .",
    "the roundness of fermi surface is enhanced by the increase of this value , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are mostly mediated by the cu-@xmath10 orbital ( which is effectively included in the two wannier orbitals in the present model ) with the path of @xmath52@xcite .",
    "it is known that the roundness of the fermi surface works against the spin - fluctuation - mediated superconductivity@xcite , so the reduction of the @xmath10 effect enhances @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath10 orbital effect is reduced by hydrostatic pressure because the energy level offset between the @xmath3 and the @xmath10 orbital is enhanced when the oxygen ligands approach cu . the effect of @xmath2 and @xmath10 orbitals put together",
    ", we can say that @xmath0 increases when the main band has more pure @xmath3 component , namely , when the `` orbital distillation '' takes place .     of the eliashberg equation plotted against the volume compression @xmath53 .",
    "arrows indicate the contribution to the @xmath36 variance from the parameters @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( see text ) .",
    ", width=453 ]      now , we turn to the first main topic of this paper , i.e. , the effect of the band width @xmath44 .",
    "the band width @xmath44 is defined as the energy range between the top and the bottom of the main band .",
    "it is evident that the band width is controlled by the in - plain bond length @xmath4 , so that hydrostatic pressure enhances @xmath44 . in fig.[hydro ] , we can see that the increase in @xmath44 results in an enhancement of @xmath36 in hg , while the opposite occurs for la .",
    "the reason for this can be understood as follows .",
    "let us first start with the @xmath15 dependence of @xmath0 for a fixed band width . in the top of fig.[vgg ] , we show the absolute value of the renormalized green s function squared @xmath54 in the hg compound at @xmath55 for several values of @xmath56 ev .",
    "the value of @xmath54 monotonically decreases with larger @xmath15 because the self - energy , which increases with @xmath15 , suppresses @xmath54 . on the other hand , the pairing interaction shown in the middle increases with @xmath15 because the spin fluctuations develop monotonically .",
    "consequently , @xmath57 shown on the right exhibits a maximum at a certain @xmath15 .",
    "since @xmath57 can be considered as a rough measure of the eigenvalue of the eliashberg equation for @xmath9wave superconductivity , @xmath36 ( and thus @xmath0 ) is expected to be _ maximized _ around a certain @xmath58 .",
    "dependence of the flex calculation result for the hg compound .",
    "( left ) the absolute value of the renormalized green s function squared @xmath54 at @xmath55 , ( middle ) the effective pairing interaction @xmath59 at @xmath60 and ( right ) the product @xmath57 .",
    ", width=529 ]    in the left panels of fig.[dl ] , we show the @xmath15 dependence of @xmath36 for @xmath61 ev for the two compounds with @xmath45 and @xmath62 .",
    "we can see that @xmath63 ev lies on the left side of @xmath58 for la , while 3 ev@xmath64 is on the right side of @xmath58 in hg .",
    "this means that larger values of @xmath15 is necessary for la to be in the `` strongly correlated regime '' .",
    "this is because electrons can avoid the strong intraorbital repulsion within @xmath3 orbitals by using the @xmath2 orbital degrees of freedom in materials with small @xmath42 .    in the right panel of fig.[dl ] , we show the @xmath15 dependence of the increment @xmath65 of the eigenvalue @xmath36 induced by the increase of @xmath44 under pressure . in this calculation , @xmath44 is increased `` by hand '' up to its value at @xmath14 , while the other two parameters are fixed at their original values . from this figure",
    ", we can see that the increase in @xmath44 always enhances @xmath0 in the hg cuprate within the realistic @xmath15 range . for the la cuprate on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath65 is negative for small values of @xmath15 , and this is the reason why @xmath44 affects superconductivity in opposite ways between la and hg in fig.[hydro ] . for larger values of @xmath15 , however , @xmath65 becomes positive even for la .     against @xmath15 for la ( top ) and hg ( bottom ) .",
    "filled ( opened ) symbols displays the result for @xmath45(@xmath14 ) .",
    "( right ) @xmath65 ( increment in @xmath36 when @xmath44 is increased up to its value at @xmath14 ) against @xmath15 .",
    ", width=453 ]    to see the effect of the band width more clearly , we provide in fig.[scheme ] a schematic band width dependence of the @xmath15 vs @xmath0 plot .",
    "namely , @xmath0 should depend on @xmath15 and @xmath44 essentially in the form @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is a certain function that gives the overall dependence of @xmath0 against the electron correlation strength .",
    "therefore , as the pressure is applied , @xmath44 increases so that @xmath58 ( peak position of the curve ) also increases accordingly keeping @xmath68 constant . at the same time",
    ", the absolute value of the maximized @xmath0 is enhanced by the application of the pressure because the entire energy scale increases ( i.e. , both @xmath58 and @xmath44 are enhanced ) .",
    "variation induced by applied pressure .",
    "each line is a @xmath15 vs. @xmath0 plot for fixed @xmath44 , and @xmath44 is larger for solid green @xmath69 dashed blue @xmath69 dotted red .",
    ", width=453 ]",
    "so far , we have concentrated on single - layer systems . in this section",
    ", we will discuss the difference of the pressure effect through @xmath42 between single and multi - layer systems . here , we focus on the comparison between single- and bi - layer la , hg , tl , bi , and y cuprates .",
    "we consider @xmath70 , the energy difference between the @xmath3 and the @xmath2 orbital in the @xmath1-@xmath7 model which considers all of the cu @xmath71 and o @xmath72 orbitals explicitly . in the @xmath1-@xmath7 model ,",
    "the basis functions for the hopping part are close to the atomic orbitals , so @xmath70 can be considered as the energy difference between the @xmath3 and the @xmath2 atomic orbitals .",
    "@xmath42 is the energy difference between the @xmath3 and the @xmath2 wannier orbitals which effectively take the o@xmath72 orbitals into account , so @xmath70 and @xmath42 are positively correlated@xcite .    in fig.[ho - ed ] , we show the relationship between the apical oxygen height @xmath5 and @xmath70 .",
    "we can see that , while @xmath70 is positively correlated with the apical oxygen height in both single- and bi - layer systems as expected , @xmath70 is overall significantly greater in the bi - layer systems than in the single - layer systems .",
    "this is because bi - layer cuprates take pyramidal coordination of the oxygen ligands , while the single - layer cuprates take an octahedral one .",
    "hence the effect of the apical oxygen should be weaker in the bi - layer systems , so that the `` effective @xmath5 '' is larger . as we have seen in the previous section , @xmath42 ( and hence the @xmath2 orbital )",
    "plays minor role in the @xmath0 enhancement under pressure in materials with large @xmath42 , so the effect of @xmath42 should become less relevant as the number of the layers increases . this can be considered as one reason why @xmath0 increases in spite of somewhat larger reduction in @xmath5 in bi - layer system than in single - layer system under hydrostatic pressure@xcite .",
    "[  ] and the level difference @xmath70 [ ev ] .",
    "the squares(circles ) show the value of @xmath70 in each bi - layer(single - layer ) system(the materials are indicated by arrows ) .",

    "in conclusion , we have performed first - principle calculation+flex study to analyze the pressure effect on @xmath0 of the cuprates . to explain the @xmath0 enhancement induced by hydrostatic pressure",
