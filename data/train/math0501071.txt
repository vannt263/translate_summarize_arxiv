    "we survey recent work of burghelea , malta and both authors on the topology of critical sets @xmath6 of ( nonlinear , ordinary ) differential operators @xmath7 .",
    "our approach is _ geometric _ , in the sense that we study the geometry and topology of @xmath6 and its image @xmath8 with the purpose of understanding the function @xmath7 .",
    "pioneering examples of this point of view for nonlinear differential equations are the results on the laplacian coupled to a special nonlinearity by ambrosetti and prodi ( @xcite ) , interpreted as properties of a global fold by berger and podolak ( @xcite ) .",
    "we begin this paper with a two dimensional example in which most of our claims can be followed visually .",
    "we then consider differential operators of increasing difficulty . for generic nonlinearities @xmath9 ,",
    "set @xmath10 on the sobolev space @xmath2 of periodic functions ( @xcite ) , with critical set @xmath11 .",
    "we show that if @xmath11 is not empty then there is a global diffeomorphism in the domain of @xmath12 converting @xmath11 into a hyperplane .",
    "there are two parts in the argument .",
    "first , we prove that the homotopy groups of @xmath11 are trivial .",
    "we then use the fact that , under very general conditions , ( weak ) homotopically equivalent infinite dimensional hilbert manifolds are actually diffeomorphic .",
    "for some classes of nonlinearities , we achieve a global normal form for @xmath12 .",
    "we proceed to the second order operator @xmath13 acting on @xmath14)$ ] , the sobolev space of functions satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions ( @xcite ) .",
    "the critical set @xmath15 now splits into connected components @xmath16 , one for each positive integer value of @xmath17 for which @xmath18 is in the interior of the image of @xmath19 .",
    "again , there exists a diffeomorphism taking each @xmath16 to a hyperplane .",
    "the proof of the triviality of homotopy groups of @xmath16 requires a very different strategy than the first order case .",
    "second order operators on @xmath5 ( the space of periodic functions ) are more complicated , in the sense that the critical set is not a manifold , but with suitable hypothesis is still contractible and admits a normal form ( @xcite ) . in brief , the critical set looks like a union of a hyperplane and infinitely many cones , with nonregular points at the vertices .",
    "nonregular points in the critical set correspond to potentials @xmath20 , @xmath21 , for which the kernel of the linear operator @xmath22 is a subspace of dimension @xmath23 of @xmath5 .",
    "the diffeomorphism of @xmath5 through which the critical set achieves its normal form takes the set of nonregular critical points to a disjoint union of linear subspaces of codimension @xmath24 .",
    "the third order case is yet more complicated : consider the set @xmath25 of pairs @xmath26 for which the kernel of the linear operator @xmath27 is a subspace of @xmath28 of dimension @xmath24 . in the final section",
    "we show that the space @xmath29 is homotopically equivalent to @xmath30 , the set of closed locally convex curves in the sphere @xmath31 with a prescribed initial base point and direction .",
    "it turns out that the space @xmath30 has three connected components ( @xcite ) , two of them having a rich algebraic topological structure , not equivalent to any finitely generated cw - complex ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the authors acknowledge the support of cnpq , faperj and finep .",
    "consider @xmath32 which is clearly a smooth ( but not analytic ) function from the plane @xmath33 to itself . in this section ,",
    "we identify @xmath34 and @xmath33 indiscriminately .",
    "how many solutions has the equation @xmath35 ?",
    "our approach to the question ( @xcite , @xcite ) breaks into a few steps .",
    "first , we compute the critical set @xmath6 of @xmath7 by searching for points in the plane in which the jacobian @xmath36 is not invertible .",
    "some numerical analysis reveals that @xmath6 consists of two simple curves @xmath37 and @xmath38 bounding disks @xmath39 . a finer inspection verifies that , as expected from whitney s classical theorems on planar singularity theory ( @xcite ) , the generic critical point is a _",
    "fold _ , i.e. , after local changes of variables the function takes the form @xmath40 close to the origin . also , nonfold points are _ cusps _ , with local normal form @xmath41 . again , with the help of some computation , one finds out that the curves @xmath37 and @xmath38 have five and eleven cusps , respectively .",
    "what may be more informative is the geometry of the images @xmath42 and @xmath43 , presented in the picture below .",
    "we now count preimages .",
    "simple estimates suffice to prove that @xmath7 is proper , and that , for sufficiently large @xmath44 , the equation @xmath45 has seven solutions . from properness",
    ", points in the same connected component of the complement of @xmath8 have the same number of pre - images .",
    "now , consider two points @xmath46 and @xmath47 in components sharing a boundary arc of ( images of ) folds . from the normal form of a function at a fold point ,",
    "the number of preimages of @xmath46 and @xmath47 under @xmath7 differ by two .",
    "the _ sense of folding _ indicates that the number of preimages _ increases _ by two whenever one gets closer to the origin when trespassing an arc of images of folds . adding up , from the knowledge that points in the unbounded connected component of the complement of @xmath8 have seven preimages , we learn the number of preimages of each component .",
    "thus , the origin has 17 preimages . in a nutshell",
    ", the number of preimages of a point under a function @xmath7 may become large when the image of the critical set @xmath6 intersects itself abundantly .    in the following sections",
    ", we shall consider functions between separable infinite dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "in many cases , the critical set turns out to be surprisingly simple .",
    "we consider the differential equation @xmath48 where the unknown @xmath49 is a real function and @xmath9 is a smooth nonlinearity . in the spirit of the example in the previous section ,",
    "we define the operator @xmath50 where @xmath51;{{\\mathbb{r } } } ) = h^1({{\\mathbb{s}}}^1;{{\\mathbb{r}}})$ ] is the sobolev space of periodic functions with weak derivative in @xmath52;{{\\mathbb{r}}})$ ] .",
    "it is easy to verify that the differential @xmath53 is a fredholm operator of index @xmath54 and therefore @xmath49 belongs to the critical set @xmath55 of @xmath12 if and only if the equation @xmath56 admits a nontrivial solution @xmath57 , i.e. , @xmath58 an equivalent spectral interpretation for @xmath11 is @xmath59 it is not hard to see ( @xcite ) that @xmath60 has a unique real eigenvalue .",
    "we assume that @xmath61 has isolated roots which are distinct from the roots of @xmath19 : this implies that @xmath54 is a regular value of @xmath62 and therefore that @xmath11 is a smooth hypersurface in @xmath63 .",
    "an @xmath64-manifold is a manifold modeled on the separable infinite dimensional hilbert space @xmath64 : @xmath11 is an @xmath64-manifold . with these hypothesis ,",
    "the topology of @xmath11 is trivial ( @xcite ) :    [ theo : a ] assume @xmath11 to be nonempty .",
    "then @xmath11 is path connected and contractible .",
    "furthermore , there is a diffeomorphism from @xmath63 to itself taking @xmath11 to a hyperplane .",
    "a natural finite dimensional counterpart of this theorem is false .",
    "indeed , let @xmath65 for @xmath66 , @xmath67 is a sphere .",
    "thus , our theorem goes hand in hand with the well known facts that in an infinite dimensional hilbert space @xmath64 , the unit sphere is contractible and there is a diffeomorphism of @xmath64 to itself taking the unit sphere to a hyperplane .",
    "the rest of this section outlines the proof of theorem [ theo : a ] .",
    "first , one proves ( @xcite ) that the homotopy groups @xmath68 are trivial .",
    "we consider only @xmath69 , i.e. , path connectedness of @xmath11 , the other cases being similar .",
    "this is done first in the space @xmath70 ( with the sup norm ) : more precisely , set @xmath71 ) | \\phi_1(u ) = 0 \\right\\};\\ ] ] it is easier to build a homotopy in the sup norm , since it is weaker .",
    "take two functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 in @xmath74 so that @xmath75 let @xmath76 $ ] be the parameter for the desired homotopy @xmath77 : we want @xmath78 .",
    "define a discontinuous function @xmath79 \\times [ 0,1 ] \\to { { \\mathbb{r}}}$ ] by @xmath80 if @xmath81 \\times [ 0,1]$ ] and @xmath82 otherwise , where @xmath83 looks like the set in figure [ fig : minhoca ] : for each @xmath84 , @xmath85 is a rather uniformly distributed subset of @xmath86 $ ] of measure @xmath87 . for each @xmath84 , @xmath88 .",
    "the function @xmath89 equals @xmath90 except on a set of very small measure , where it is defined so as to obtain a continuous @xmath91 for which @xmath92 .    in order to prove that the homotopy groups @xmath68 are also trivial",
    ", we use the following theorem ( @xcite ) with @xmath93 , @xmath94)$ ] , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 the inclusion .",
    "[ theo : c ] let @xmath98 and @xmath99 be separable banach spaces .",
    "supose @xmath100 is a bounded , injective map with dense image and @xmath101 a smooth , closed submanifold of finite codimension .",
    "then @xmath102 is a smooth closed submanifold of @xmath99 , and the restrictions @xmath103 and @xmath104 are homotopy equivalences .",
    "since @xmath11 , being an @xmath64-manifold , is homotopy equivalent to a cw - complex , weak contractibility implies contractibility and @xmath11 is contractible ( and , by theorem [ theo : c ] , @xmath105 is contractible too ) . the connected components of the complement of @xmath11 are also contractible .",
    "indeed , let @xmath106 be a continuous map ; since @xmath63 is obviously contractible , @xmath107 can be extended to @xmath108 .",
    "since @xmath11 is contractible , @xmath91 can be redefined to take each connected component of @xmath109 not touching @xmath110 to @xmath11 . a normal vector to @xmath11",
    "can then be used to push the image of @xmath91 away from @xmath11 , yielding @xmath111 .",
    "thus , the homotopy groups @xmath112 , @xmath113 , are trivial and therefore the connected components of @xmath114 are contractible . to complete the proof of theorem [ theo : a ] , we use the following result ( @xcite ) :    [ theo : b ] suppose @xmath115 is a smooth homotopy equivalence of @xmath64-manifolds with boundary , @xmath116 a closed submanifold of finite codimension and @xmath117 .",
    "suppose also that @xmath0 is transversal to @xmath118 and the maps @xmath119 and @xmath120 are homotopy equivalences .",
    "then there exists a diffeomorphism between @xmath121 and @xmath122 which is homotopic to @xmath0 as maps of triples .",
    "set @xmath123 and consider the functional @xmath124 defined above . write @xmath125 ) = \\langle 1 \\rangle \\oplus \\langle 1 \\rangle^{\\perp } $ ] , where @xmath126 is the vector space of constant functions and @xmath127 , the space of functions @xmath57 of average @xmath128 equal to zero , is a hyperplane in @xmath129 . set @xmath130 to be @xmath131 .",
    "set @xmath132 so that the critical set @xmath11 equals @xmath133 , and the genericity condition on @xmath0 ensures that @xmath134 is a hypersurface of @xmath135 and @xmath0 is transversal to @xmath118 .",
    "notice that @xmath136 .",
    "since @xmath137 is contractible , we obtain that @xmath0 is a homotopy equivalence between @xmath138 and @xmath118 .",
    "similarly , since the connected components of @xmath139 are contractible , @xmath120 is a homotopy equivalence and theorem [ theo : a ] follows .",
    "the proofs of theorems [ theo : c ] and [ theo : b ] are rather technical and shall not be discussed here .",
    "a simple spinoff is the following density result which may be of independent interest .",
    "[ theo : dense ] let @xmath98 be a banach space , @xmath140 a dense ( linear ) subspace and @xmath101 a finite codimension submanifold .",
    "then the intersection @xmath141 is dense in @xmath142 .",
    "for the first order differential operator @xmath12 , generically , it is easy to prove that the critical @xmath11 stratifies by complexity of the singularities , which are infinite dimensional counterparts of the familiar morin singularities ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in a nutshell ,",
    "the morin singularity is the generic situation for a germ from @xmath144 to itself whose jacobian at 0 has a one dimensional kernel .",
    "there is essentially one _ elementary _ morin singularity in each dimension , with very simple normal forms : the fold @xmath145 , the cusp @xmath146 , the swallowtail @xmath147 , the butterfly @xmath148, ",
    "one should take into account morin singularities arising by taking cartesian products : the fold @xmath145 embeds into the ( non - elementary ) fold @xmath149 .",
    "even in infinite dimensions , morin singularites are always cartesian products of an elementary singularity ( for which one defines a natural _ order _ , given by the degree of the top polynomial of its normal form ) and the identity mapping with the appropriate codimension ( @xcite ; also @xcite for infinite dimensional cusps ) .",
    "what is the topology of the finer strata ? for the first order differential operator @xmath12 with a generic nonlinearity @xmath0 , the subset @xmath150 of critical points which are nonfold points again has trivial topology .",
    "the proof of this statement begins with the following result :    [ theo : sigma2 ] for a generic smooth nonlinearity @xmath9 , there is a diffeomorphism from @xmath63 to itself taking the sets @xmath11 and @xmath150 of @xmath12 respectively to the zero level of the functional @xmath62 and to the zero level of the pair @xmath151 , where @xmath152    consider now a vector valued extension of the argument used to prove that the homotopy groups of @xmath11 are trivial ( @xcite ) . let @xmath142 be a compact , finite dimensional manifold with a smooth riemannian metric inducing a normalized measure @xmath153 , so that @xmath154 .",
    "let @xmath155 a separable banach space of continuous real valued functions on @xmath142 , which is closed under multiplication by functions of @xmath156 ( here , multiplication in @xmath157 is continuous ) .",
    "for a smooth function @xmath158 define @xmath159 as the average of the nemytski operator associated to @xmath0 , @xmath160 let @xmath161 be the projection on the first @xmath162 coordinates .",
    "we say that @xmath54 is a _",
    "strong regular value _ of @xmath163 if @xmath54 is a regular value of each composition @xmath164 .",
    "finally , let @xmath165 : if @xmath54 is a strong regular value of @xmath163 , the sets @xmath166 are nested submanifolds of @xmath155 of codimension @xmath162 .",
    "[ theo : nemi ] suppose @xmath54 is a strong regular value of @xmath163 as above",
    ". then the levels @xmath166 are contractible .",
    "moreover , there is a global homeomorphism @xmath167 taking each @xmath166 to a closed linear subspace of @xmath155 of codimension @xmath162 .",
    "if @xmath155 is a hilbert space , @xmath168 can be taken to be a diffeomorphism .",
    "thus , for a generic nonlinearity , the zero levels of @xmath62 and @xmath151 are ambient diffeomorphic to nested subspaces of codimension 1 and 2 , and we obtain the topological triviality of @xmath11 ( again ) and of @xmath150 .",
    "theorem [ theo : sigma2 ] is necessary because the set of nonfold points is _ not _ described naturally in terms of zero levels of vector nemytski operators .",
    "this is the reason for which we do not know how to address topological properties of higher order strata .",
    "the image @xmath169 clearly depends on the nonlinearity .",
    "we list a few facts ( @xcite ) , some of which had been known ( @xcite ) .    1 .",
    "suppose @xmath0 is strictly increasing , onto the interval @xmath170 .",
    "then @xmath12 is a diffeomorphism onto the strip @xmath171 2 .",
    "if @xmath0 is strictly convex , @xmath12 is a global fold . if @xmath0 is generic , and all critical points of @xmath12 are folds , then @xmath12 is a global fold .",
    "there are nonconvex linearities for which @xmath12 is a global fold .",
    "3 .   if @xmath0 is a generic polynomial of even degree , positive leading coefficient , taking negative values , then @xmath12 has cusps .",
    "4 .   suppose @xmath9 is proper , with derivative @xmath19 assuming both signs and third derivative with isolated roots assuming only one sign .",
    "then @xmath12 is a global cusp , in the sense that diffeomorphisms on @xmath63 and @xmath172 convert @xmath12 to the normal form @xmath173    the last example establishes a conjecture by cafagna and donati ( @xcite ) on the global topology of operators associated to the nonlinearity @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 .    from the examples ,",
    "the number of preimages of an operator associated to a generic nonlinearity given by a polynomial of degree less than or equal to three is bounded by the degree of the polynomial .",
    "this is false for polynomials of degree four .",
    "the counterexample in @xcite was obtained by adjusting coefficients of the nonlinearity in order to obtain a butterfly in the critical set of @xmath12 .",
    "singularity theory combined with a degree theoretic argument imply the existence of a point with six preimages , five of which are near the butterfly .",
    "both nonlinearity and special point were computed numerically .    on a related note ,",
    "pugh conjectured that the equation @xmath178 would have at most @xmath162 solutions .",
    "the conjecture was essentially verified by smale for @xmath179 and @xmath180 if @xmath181 for all @xmath182 .",
    "the general conjecture was proved false by lins neto ( @xcite ) .",
    "our example has the special feature that @xmath183 is constant in @xmath182 for @xmath184 .",

    "again , by fredholm theory , the critical set @xmath15 of @xmath189 consists of functions @xmath190 for which @xmath191 has zero in the spectrum .    for a more explicit description of @xmath15 ,",
    "define the fundamental solution @xmath192 , @xmath193 and consider the ( continuously defined ) argument @xmath194 of the vector @xmath195 for which @xmath196 .",
    "notice the implicit dependence of @xmath197 on @xmath192 , which in turn depends on @xmath49 .",
    "then @xmath198 thus , there must be different connected components of @xmath15 for each value of @xmath199 .",
    "said differently , the fact that the eigenvalue @xmath54 of @xmath200 may be the @xmath17-th eigenvalue in the spectrum ( counting from below ) induces different critical components of @xmath189 . define the functional @xmath201 as the value of the argument at @xmath202 of the fundamental solution @xmath192 associated to @xmath49 and consider subsets @xmath16 which partition @xmath15 , given by the @xmath203-levels of @xmath204 . for a generic set of nonlinearities @xmath0 , the set @xmath16 is nonempty if and only if the number @xmath18 belongs to the interior of the image of @xmath19 : in this case , @xmath16 is path connected and contractible .",
    "we want to prove that arbitrary functions from a sphere @xmath110 to @xmath16 are homotopic to constants .",
    "theorem [ theo : nemi ] is not the appropriate tool anymore , among other reasons because the functional @xmath204 depends on the derivative @xmath205 . from the topological theorems of section 3 , it suffices to control the deformation in the sup norm .",
    "contractibility then implies a global change of variables in @xmath206 which flattens the connected components @xmath16 into hyperplanes .",
    "the stratification of the critical set in morin singularities still applies , but there are no results at this point about the global topology of the finer strata .",
    "the idea behind the construction of the homotopy is to change @xmath49 so as to approach a function @xmath207 which is constant equal to a value @xmath208 with the property that @xmath209 except for two small intervals at the endpoints .",

    "@xmath212 , the argument of the vector @xmath213 .",
    "since @xmath214 if @xmath215 , @xmath216 , the sets @xmath16 are @xmath203-levels for both @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",

    "the homotopy squeezes the graph of @xmath222 between parallel walls advancing towards the line @xmath223 , as shown in figure [ fig : h5 ] .",
    "a corresponding @xmath49 is obtained by changing its original value in the region of the domain over which the graph of @xmath222 has been squeezed  there , the new value of @xmath49 is @xmath208 .",
    "the value of @xmath218 for this new @xmath49 equals @xmath224 , but such @xmath49 is discontinuous and therefore not acceptable .",
    "we make amends : the region where the graph of @xmath222 trespasses the wall by more than a prescribed tolerance is taken to @xmath208 and in the region where the graph of @xmath222 lies strictly between the walls , @xmath49 is unchanged . hence , there is an open region in the domain where @xmath49 assumes rather arbitrary values in order to preserve its continuity .",
    "similar results were previously obtained for the special case when @xmath0 is a convex nonlinearity ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the trivial topology of each connected component @xmath16 then follows from the fact that each such set is a graph over the hyperplane in @xmath206 of functions orthogonal to @xmath225 .",
    "things get more complicated for the second order operator with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "as is well known , the associated linearizations do not necessarily have simple spectrum .",
    "critical sets now are _ not _ submanifolds , and one has to be careful about nonregular points . still , a description of the global geometry of the critical set is possible ( @xcite ) .    for any smooth nonlinearity @xmath9 denote by @xmath226 the differential operator @xmath227 where @xmath228 ; { { \\mathbb{r } } } ) = h^2({{\\mathbb{s}}}^1 ; { { \\mathbb{r}}})$ ] and @xmath229 ; { { \\mathbb{r } } } ) = l^2({{\\mathbb{s}}}^1 ; { { \\mathbb{r}}})$ ] .",
    "we are interested in the critical set @xmath230 of @xmath226 .",
