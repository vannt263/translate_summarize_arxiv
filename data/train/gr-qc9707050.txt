    "an important task in numerical relativity is locating black holes in numerically generated spacetimes , both for technical purposes and for extracting physical information .",
    "a black hole is a region of spacetime out of which no null geodesics escape to infinity .",
    "the boundary of the black hole , the event horizon , is formed by those outward - going , future - directed null geodesics which neither fall into the singularity nor escape to null infinity .",
    "the event horizon contains important geometric information about the spacetime .",
    "it is a global construction and can in principle only be determined when the entire spacetime is known . in practice",
    ", one can obtain a good approximation to the event horizon within a finite spacetime region , once the black hole has settled down to a stationary state . by definition ,",
    "the event horizon repels future - directed null geodesics , but attracts past ones .",
    "one can then evolve past - directed null geodesics back through the spacetime , and find the event horizon as the surface to which they are attracted @xcite .",
    "locating black holes is crucial in numerical relativity also for a technical reason : spacetime slicings which avoid black holes rapidly become singular .",
    "instead one would like to excise a spacetime region just inside the event horizon from the numerical domain during the numerical evolution , using the fact that it can not influence events outside the black hole . during the time evolution , however , one does not yet know where the event horizon is .",
    "instead one needs to use the poor man s event horizon , the apparent horizon .",
    "an apparent horizon ( ah ) is defined within a single time slice , or spacelike hypersurface @xmath1 , namely as a smooth embedded 2-surface whose outgoing normal null geodesics have zero expansion",
    ". there may be one such surface enclosing another one , in which case the outermost one is the apparent horizon .",
    "if one combines the apparent horizon on each time slice into a 3-dimensional surface , this world tube will depend on the slicing , and can be discontinuous .",
    "nevertheless one can show that if an apparent horizon exists on a given time slice , it must be inside a black hole @xcite .",
    "the converse is not true : there are slicings of black hole spacetimes without any apparent horizons @xcite . for numerical purposes",
    "one simply hopes that this case is unusual and that the apparent horizon gives a reasonable indication of the event horizon .",
    "a wide variety of numerical algorithms for finding ahs have been explored or suggested . for the purpose of excising the black hole region , one needs to find the apparent horizon frequently , perhaps at each time step .",
    "when two black holes collide , a new ah enveloping the two separate ones appears suddenly . therefore the main requirements are speed and finding the ah from scratch , without a good initial guess .",
    "precision is less important for black hole excision , although a safe error estimate is , so that one can be sure not to excise too much and inject unphysical boundary conditions .    in spherical symmetry , the ah problem reduces to an algebraic equation . in axisymmetry",
    ", it reduces to an ordinary differential equation with periodic boundary conditions . in this paper",
    "we shall be concerned exclusively with the 3-dimensional problem without any symmetries , either continuous or discrete , where one deals with a highly nonlinear elliptic problem on a closed 2-surface . in practice",
    "this will always be the 2-sphere , or several disconnected 2-spheres @xcite , which can be treated separately .",
    "all 3d ah finder algorithms proposed so far can be classified according to a few key choices , which can be made independently one from another . how are candidate ahs represented ?",
    "one can parameterize an embedded 2-surface either by introducing coordinates on it , or as a level set of a function on the 3-dimensional slice in which it is embedded .",
    "how is the curvature of the candidate ah calculated ?",
    "one can discretize the necessary spatial derivatives by finite differencing , finite elements , or pseudo - spectral methods .",
    "a third fundamental choice is between solving the elliptic problem directly , or converting it into a parabolic problem , in which the solution of the elliptic problem is approached during an evolution in an unphysical time parameter .",
    "the distinction between these last two approaches is not sharp in practice . on the one hand one",
    "always solves a nonlinear elliptic problem by iteration . on the other , numerical implementation of any parabolic approach requires an implicit `` time '' step for stability , thus posing a new elliptic problem that becomes equivalent to the original one in the limit of an infinitely large time step .",
    "we now discuss previous ah finders in terms of these choices .",
    "nakamura , koshima and oohara @xcite represent the ah in spherical coordinates as @xmath2 .",
    "we note that this requires the surface to be a 2-sphere , and star - shaped ( convex ) around the point @xmath3 .",
    "the shape function @xmath4 is expanded in spherical harmonics .",
    "this spectral decomposition is used to calculate the derivatives of @xmath5 in formulating the elliptic problem .",
    "the orthonormality and completeness of the spherical harmonics is used to subtract the linear elliptic operator @xmath6 from the nonlinear elliptic problem and invert it .",
    "this gives rise to an iteration prescription .",
    "we shall see that this iteration can also be described as the discretization in unphysical time of a parabolic problem .",
    "it remains unclear from @xcite by what method the spectral decomposition back and forth is carried out for cauchy data which are only known in numerical form and on a grid .",
    "the nakamura _",
    "_ algorithm has been independently coded and tested , and extended in various directions by kemball and bishop @xcite .",
    "they report exponential convergence , good robustness , and high precision unless the point @xmath3 is close to the ah .",
    "tod @xcite has proposed a geometrically defined flow under which a trial 2-surface evolves to the ah . for time - symmetric slices ,",
    "the ah problem reduces to that of finding a minimal surface , and tod s prescription to mean curvature flow .",
    "this is well - known to converge to minimal surfaces . on non time - symmetric slices , only lower order terms",
    "are added to the problem , so that one may hope that tod s flow also converges for such data in practice .",
    "tod s algorithm is parabolic , without specifying how the surface is represented or differenced .",
    "tod s algorithm has been implemented numerically by bernstein @xcite using finite differencing in coordinates introduced on the surface .",
    "he discusses stable extrinsic algorithms for parabolic problems , and reports good results in axisymmetry using one of them , but technical problems to do with finite differencing on the sphere in the general case .",
    "pasch @xcite has implemented mean curvature flow representing the test surface as a level set .",
    "this allows for a change of topology during the evolution .",
    "he has successfully tested the algorithm using brill - lindquist data for 1 , 2 or 3 black holes , using a fast implicit time evolution package , and finite differencing on a cartesian grid in the embedding space .",
    "thornburg @xcite attacks the elliptic problem directly using finite differencing on a square @xmath7 grid , and newton s method to solve the discretized equations .",
    "he calculates the jacobian required for newton s method by first linearizing the differential equations , then finite differencing the result .",
    "this is more efficient than numerical differentiation .",
    "he finds high precision results , but a nonlinear instability in high - frequency modes .",
    "huq @xcite has extended newton s method to data without symmetries in cartesian - type coordinates .",
    "the ncsa / washu algorithm @xcite uses the parameterization @xmath2 , and a spectral decomposition to parameterize @xmath5 and calculate its derivatives .",
    "the discretized elliptic problem is solved by applying a standard minimization algorithm to the sum of @xmath8 over all surface points . the spectral basis is not required to be orthonormal for this purpose .",
    "_ @xcite have implemented the ncsa / washu algorithm independently , with the difference that they use the true spherical harmonics as a basis .",
    "both algorithms locate points on the 2-surface on a square @xmath7 grid , interpolating data from the 3-dimensional cartesian grid used in the 3 + 1 time evolution .    in this paper",
    "we review different previous algorithms in one common , fully covariant notation .",
    "this analysis suggests to us a new algorithm which combines essential ideas of the algorithms of tod and nakamura _ et al . _ from our analysis we expect this algorithm to be as fast as that of nakamura _ et al . _",
    "( and therefore much faster than existing implementations of tod s algorithm ) , while being as robust in practice as that of tod .",
    "we describe the details of a numerical implementation of this algorithm , and some initial tests .",
    "the results are encouraging .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we set up the mathematical formalism of the problem .",
    "we begin by deriving the differential equation that determines an apparent horizon in ii.a . in ii.b",
    "we discuss different ways of parameterizing apparent horizon candidates , that is , smooth embedded 2-surfaces , and in ii.c we provide tools for spectral methods on the 2-sphere .",
    "in section iii we review various algorithms for finding ahs , namely the pseudo - spectral algorithm of nakamura _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , jacobi s method , and the generalized mean curvature flow suggested by tod @xcite .",
    "we then build on this review by presenting a family of algorithm which contains the previous algorithms as limiting cases , and suggesting that in the middle of the family there are algorithms that perform better than the limiting members . in section",
    "iv we describe a numerical implementation of our proposed algorithm . in section",
    "v we test its performance in finding apparent horizons in brill - lindquist and kerr data given in cartesian coordinates on a grid .",
    "here we give a brief derivation ( see also @xcite ) of the differential equation that we try to solve in the remainder of the paper , both to give a complete presentation of the problem and to fix notation . throughout the paper , lower - case",
    "latin indices from the beginning of the alphabet indicate abstract index notation .",
    "indices from the middle of the alphabet indicate 3-dimensional tensor _",
    "components_. our signature convention is @xmath9 .",
    "we begin with a series of definitions .",
    "let @xmath10 be a spacetime , and @xmath11 the covariant derivative associated with @xmath12 .",
    "( we use this notation to reserve the symbols @xmath13 and @xmath14 for 3 dimensions . )",
    "let @xmath1 be a smooth spacelike hypersurface , and let @xmath15 be the future - pointing unit timelike normal to @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath12 gives rise to cauchy data @xmath16 on @xmath1 , where @xmath13 is the positive definite 3-metric induced on @xmath1 and @xmath17 is the extrinsic curvature of @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath14 is the covariant derivative associated with @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath18 be a closed smooth hypersurface of @xmath1 , which means it is two - dimensional and spacelike , and @xmath19 its unit outward pointing normal in @xmath1 , which is also spacelike , and normal to @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath13 induces a positive definite 2-metric @xmath20 on @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath21 be the future - pointing null geodesic congruence whose projection on @xmath1 is orthogonal to @xmath18 , that is @xmath22 then @xmath21 describes light rays leaving @xmath18 normally from the point of view of an observer whose instantaneous simultaneity is @xmath1 .",
    "clearly @xmath21 depends not only on the spacetime and on @xmath18 , but also on @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath23 be the expansion of that congruence , @xmath24    we would like to express @xmath23 in terms of the cauchy data @xmath0 , and the normal @xmath19 to @xmath18 .",
    "the crucial step is to note that , up to an overall factor , @xmath25 clearly this obeys the conditions @xmath26 and @xmath27 on @xmath18 .",
    "we continue @xmath21 away from @xmath18 by the remaining condition @xmath28 .",
    "we also continue @xmath19 away from @xmath18 in @xmath1 assuming that it retains unit length , but otherwise in an arbitrary manner .",
    "then we have , on @xmath18 , @xmath29 + s^a[k^b \\nabla^{(4)}_a k_b ] - s^a [ s^b \\nabla^{(4)}_a s_b ]   - s^a s^b \\nabla^{(4)}_a n_b \\cr   \\label{h } & & = \\nabla_a s^a - k + s^a s^b k_{ab},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "all terms in square brackets vanish individually by definition .    a smooth embedded closed surface with outward pointing unit normal @xmath19 that obeys @xmath31 everywhere on @xmath18",
    "is called a marginally outer trapped surface .",
    "the outermost of such surfaces , if one or more exist in @xmath1 , is called the apparent horizon in @xmath1 @xcite . on the one hand",
    "this definition is global in @xmath1 , which makes finding an apparent horizon a non - trivial problem . on the other ,",
    "it is local in time , as @xmath23 depends only on the cauchy data @xmath32 on a single slice @xmath1 .",
    "if one fixes the slicing of a given spacetime , calculates the apparent horizon on each slice , and then combines the apparent horizons on each slice to obtain a timelike , @xmath33 dimensional world - tube , this world - tube depends on the slicing .",
    "this is in contrast to the event horizon , which depends globally on the entire spacetime , but is independent of the slicing .      before we can discuss solving the apparent horizon equation @xmath31 in practice",
    ", we need to parameterize candidate apparent horizons , that is , two - dimensional , smooth , closed surfaces @xmath18 embedded in @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath34 be coordinates on @xmath1 .",
    "one way of parameterizing @xmath18 is then to introduce coordinates @xmath35 on @xmath18 ( at least locally ) , and give a map @xmath36 . in this case",
    ", the topology of @xmath18 is fixed in advance .",
    "furthermore , different functions @xmath37 describe the same abstract surface @xmath18 , corresponding to a change of coordinates @xmath35 on @xmath18 .    a different way of parameterizing @xmath18 is as a level set @xmath38 as long as the form of @xmath39 is not restricted , this has the advantage of @xmath18 allowing to have arbitrary topology . in particular , @xmath18 can be disconnected .",
    "again , many different functions @xmath39 describe the same abstract surface @xmath18 , as long as they have the one level set @xmath40 in common .",
    "it is straightforward to express @xmath23 as a function of @xmath41 and its derivatives .",
    "the unit normal ( with respect to the 3-metric @xmath13 ) of any level set of @xmath41 is @xmath42 @xmath23 is therefore a quasi - linear second order differential operator acting on @xmath41 .",
    "now we come back to the problem that different functions @xmath43 describe the same abstract surface @xmath18 . a possible gauge condition would be to make @xmath41 harmonic with respect to a background metric @xmath44 , or with respect to the physical 3-metric @xmath13 .",
    "then its value everywhere depends only on its value on a suitable two - dimensional surface , such as the boundary of the numerical domain . here , instead",
    ", we follow several previous authors in restricting @xmath41 to the form @xmath45,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 are related to a set of cartesian coordinates @xmath34 in the usual way , namely @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . the overall sign of @xmath41 has been chosen so that @xmath19 given in ( [ s^a ] ) points outward .",
    "this parameterization is equivalent to @xmath50 $ ]",
    ". the obvious disadvantages of restricting @xmath41 to this form are that the topology of @xmath18 must be @xmath51 , and that @xmath18 must be star - shaped around the coordinate origin @xmath3 .",
    "the advantages are that surfaces @xmath18 correspond uniquely to functions @xmath5 , and that we can use the natural basis @xmath52 for expanding the function @xmath5 .",
    "considered as a quasi - linear differential operator acting on @xmath39 , @xmath23 is not elliptic in three dimensions , because one of the three eigenvalues of @xmath53 , the one with eigenvector @xmath19 , is zero .",
    "considered as a differential operator in two dimensions acting on @xmath4 , it is elliptic . in this two - dimensional interpretation",
    "it is nonlinear not only through the explicit appearance of @xmath54 in the coefficients of @xmath55 , but also through its dependence on the point where the tensor fields @xmath13 and @xmath17 are evaluated , which depends on @xmath41 itself .",
    "this means that @xmath13 and @xmath17 play the same role in the apparent horizon equation as the internal metric of a nonlinear @xmath56-model does in its equation of motion .",
    "because the coefficients of the elliptic equation contain @xmath13 and @xmath17 as free functions , it appears unlikely that one can prove existence of solutions for sufficiently general @xmath13 and @xmath17 .      in this subsection",
    "we introduce in geometric terms some tools that we need later on to discuss spectral methods on the 2-sphere .",
    "the key idea of any pseudo - spectral method for solving a nonlinear elliptic problem is to subtract from the nonlinear one a simple linear elliptic operator that can be inverted explicitly by spectral methods . in our problem ,",
    "the principal part of the operator @xmath23 acting on @xmath5 is the laplacian with respect to the 2-dimensional metric @xmath57 induced on the surface @xmath58 by the metric @xmath13 . as @xmath58 is topologically a 2-sphere , a natural candidate for subtraction is the laplacian @xmath6 on the round 2-sphere .",
    "it can be inverted using the spherical harmonics .",
    "we could define @xmath6 on @xmath1 by first introducing spherical coordinates @xmath46 , and then defining its action on a scalar @xmath59 as the usual combination of partial derivatives with respect to those coordinates , that is , @xmath60 setting up these coordinates also has the effect of lifting the spherical harmonics from the 2-sphere to all of @xmath1 , by smoothly identifying points on different spheres @xmath61    the minimal geometric structure which allows us to make the same definitions without reference to preferred coordinates is a flat background metric @xmath44 on @xmath1 ( independent of the physical metric @xmath13 ) , together with a preferred point @xmath62 . let the covariant derivative associated with @xmath44 be @xmath63 , and let @xmath64 be the inverse of @xmath65 .",
    "we foliate @xmath1 into level surfaces of the scalar field @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the geodesic distance with respect to @xmath65 between the points @xmath68 and @xmath62 .",
    "the vector @xmath69 is the unit normal with respect to @xmath44 on the surfaces of constant @xmath66 .",
    "the flat metric @xmath13 then induces the metric @xmath70 on the surfaces of constant @xmath66 .",
    "this induced metric has a constant curvature of @xmath71 , so that @xmath72 is a metric of unit curvature on the 2-spheres @xmath61 we now define @xmath6 as the laplacian of this 2-dimensional metric : @xmath73 by direct substitution one verifies that , if @xmath44 is given as @xmath74 this reduces to eq . ( [ l2standard ] ) . our definition ( [ l^2 ] ) ,",
    "however , is covariant , and can be used to define the action of @xmath6 on arbitrary tensors , and in arbitrary coordinate systems .    for our purposes",
    "we characterize the spherical harmonics @xmath75 as a set of scalar functions on @xmath1 with two properties : they are orthonormal in the sense that @xmath76 where @xmath18 is any smooth surface that is star - shaped around @xmath3 , and where @xmath77 is the measure induced on @xmath18 by @xmath78 .",
    "( in spherical coordinates this reduces to the standard measure @xmath79 . ) from this it follows that @xmath80 [ in spherical coordinates @xmath81 .",
    "] we also require that the @xmath75 are eigenfunctions of @xmath6 : @xmath82 for @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "we do not define @xmath85 as the eigenvalue of @xmath86 ( @xmath87 in spherical coordinates ) , but only use it as a label on the orthonormal basis .",
    "this leaves us free to combine @xmath75 and @xmath88 of the standard complex definition to obtain a real orthonormal basis more convenient for numerical purposes .",
    "we now use our covariant notation for @xmath6 and the @xmath75 in reviewing the algorithm of nakamura , kojima and oohara @xcite ( from now on nko ) for finding an apparent horizon .",
    "nko characterize @xmath18 by @xmath2 in spherical coordinates , and expand @xmath5 in spherical harmonics : @xmath89 ( a finite value of @xmath90 is required in any numerical implementation . )",
    "we begin our description of the algorithm with the trivial observation that @xmath31 is equivalent to @xmath91 where @xmath92 is any strictly positive function . in the nko algorithm ,",
    "the weight function @xmath92 is specified by demanding that the coefficient of the partial derivative @xmath93 cancels in the combination @xmath94 .",
    "( the notation @xmath92 is ours , not that of nko . we introduce it here because we want to consider other choices of @xmath92 later on . ) integrating over the @xmath75 and using ( [ cond0 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath95 nko now use this equation in an iteration procedure , @xmath96 , where @xmath97 labels iteration steps , of the form @xmath98 where the right - hand side is evaluated from the @xmath99 .",
    "as this formula does not cover @xmath100 , @xmath100 is determined at each iteration step by solving @xmath101 for @xmath100 ( note @xmath102 )    we now try to understand what makes the nko method work . for this purpose",
    "we express @xmath103 in terms of the flat background derivation @xmath63 : @xmath104   - k_{ab } \\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath105 , and @xmath19 is defined by eq .",

    "this is indeed the case for the @xmath92 of nko and the other choices we explore later on .",
    "the principal symbol @xmath110 is @xmath113 the principal symbol of a quasi - linear differential operator does not depend on the choice of derivation , here @xmath63 .",
    "we can verify this for the case at hand .",
    "we see that @xmath110 is a difference between two projectors : the first one onto surfaces of constant @xmath41 , and with respect to the physical metric @xmath13 , the other onto surfaces of constant coordinate @xmath66 , and with the respect to the background metric @xmath44 . in the trivial case",
    "where @xmath13 is conformally related to @xmath44 ( conformally flat ) , and where surfaces of constant @xmath41 coincide with surfaces of constant @xmath66 ( spherical symmetry ) , one can choose @xmath92 so as to make the entire tensor @xmath110 vanish .",
    "in general , one can impose only one condition on its six components .",
    "the choice of nko is , in our notation , @xmath114 we prefer a coordinate - independent choice , and impose @xmath115 the motivation of either choice is to cancel , as far as possible , that part of @xmath116 which looks like @xmath6 .",
    "our choice does not introduce a preferred direction within the tangent space of @xmath18 , which may be an esthetic more than a practical advantage . solving our condition for @xmath92 , we obtain @xmath117^{-1 } \\equiv |\\nabla   f| \\sigma,\\ ] ] where the second equation defines @xmath56 .",
    "now we recognize an important ingredient of the nko algorithm , its smoothing property . putting the individual components",
    "@xmath118 back together again , we can write ( [ l>0 ] ) as @xmath119 ( this is only formal because of the special role of @xmath100 : @xmath6 does not have an inverse . )",
    "any iterative algorithm for solving an elliptic problem runs the danger of being unstable to the growth of high - frequency numerical noise . whereas @xmath23 acts on @xmath5 as a second - order differential operator , thus increasing unsmoothness , @xmath120 has the @xmath6 part taken out , and therefore creates less high - frequency noise .",
    "moreover , @xmath121 acts as a smoothing operator .",
    "one therefore expects @xmath122 to be smoother than @xmath123 .",
    "this is a necessary property for any iterative algorithm that can converge from a rough initial guess without blowing up through high - frequency noise on the way .      in order to see how the nko algorithm is related to other algorithms , we rewrite ( [ 30 ] ) once more , as @xmath124 it is now tempting to go from the discrete algorithm to a continuous flow in an unphysical `` time '' parameter @xmath125 : @xmath126 the nko algorithm proper , namely @xmath127 is formally recovered from this differential equation by forward - differencing it with respect to @xmath125 , with a step size @xmath128 , and inverting @xmath6 by the pseudo - spectral method ( we again disregard the special role of @xmath100 ) .",
    "other differencing methods , such as centered differencing , and using a different `` time '' step , give rise to obvious alternative algorithms .",
    "some of these have been examined by kemball and bishop @xcite .",
    "kemball and bishop also consider different methods of enforcing the constraint ( [ a00 ] ) on @xmath100 and of coupling it to the iteration method for the other @xmath118 .",
    "any flow method can be considered as an example of jacobi s method .",
    "this is the recipe of solving an elliptic equation @xmath129 by transforming it into a parabolic equation @xmath130 . if @xmath131 is the laplace operator , then the resulting equation is the heat equation , and jacobi s method is known to converge .",
    "as @xmath23 acting on @xmath5 resembles @xmath132 , one might try the flow @xmath133 we have implemented this numerically in the pseudo - spectral framework and find empirically that its high frequency noise blows up unless one chooses a very small step size .",
    "the origin of this instability is clear from the analogy with the heat equation .",
    "the heat equation on @xmath51 is @xmath134 we decompose @xmath59 into spherical harmonics , as @xmath135 .",
    "for the spectral components we obtain @xmath136 .",
    "all spectral components decrease exponentially . discretizing this equation in time , however ,",
    "for example by forward differencing , we obtain@xmath137 .",
    "this is stable only for @xmath138 , that is for @xmath139 . in all explicit methods ,",
    "the time step is limited by order of magnitude to @xmath140 the same limit arises if one discretizes @xmath6 by finite differencing , where it takes the form @xmath141 similar stability limits exist for all parabolic equations . the nko algorithm does not have this instability problem .",
    "it replaces @xmath31 by @xmath142 as the elliptic problem to be solved , and clearly @xmath121 acts a smoothing operator that keeps high frequency noise down .",
    "an appropriate choice of @xmath92 makes this even more effective by making @xmath143 as similar to @xmath132 as possible .      from considering an iterative approach as the discretization of a flow on the space of surfaces , one",
    "is led to the generalized mean curvature flow algorithm of tod @xcite and other geometrically motivated flows .",
    "tod proposes deforming a trial surface @xmath18 embedded in @xmath1 by means of the flow @xmath144 where @xmath19 is again the outward - pointing normal to @xmath18 .",
    "[ tod uses the notation @xmath145 for the left - hand side , but we wanted to stress here that @xmath146 is a vector field and independent of coordinates . ] for time - symmetric cauchy data , @xmath147 , we have @xmath148 , which is simply the trace of the extrinsic curvature of @xmath18 induced by its embedding in @xmath1 , also called the mean curvature .",
    "@xmath31 is then equivalent to @xmath18 having extremal area , and @xmath149 is the gradient of the area . in this case , mean curvature flow is guaranteed to converge to a surface of @xmath31 , or extremal area , also called a minimal surface .",
    "there is an extended literature on mean curvature flow and minimal surfaces @xcite .",

    "this flow is no longer guaranteed to converge , but one may hope that it does , as the additional terms are of lower order .",
    "one essential strength of generalized mean curvature flow is that it can not move a test surface _ through _ an ah , even for @xmath151 .",

    "while @xmath17 does not vanish , the data are still special in that the two contributions to @xmath23 , @xmath152 and @xmath323 , vanish separately on the ah .",
    "we have tested our algorithm on these data for different ratios of @xmath324 , different offsets @xmath303 between the center of the black hole and the center of spherical harmonics , and for different orientations",
    "@xmath316 of the black hole symmetry axis relative to the spherical harmonics .",
    "the results are essentially the same as for the single brill - lindquist black hole , giving an indication that the presence of the extrinsic curvature term does not make a qualitative change to the performance of the algorithm .",
    "numerical general relativity requires a fast and robust algorithm for finding apparent horizons in cauchy data without symmetries in three dimensions given on a grid . in this paper",
    "we have described a new apparent horizon finder algorithm which appears to be as fast but more robust than its best predecessor .",
    "we began from a general classification of possible approaches to the problem .",
    "any approach which poses the problem as a nonlinear elliptic equation on a topological two - sphere and then attacks that equation directly will fail unless provided with a very good initial guess , because the problem is nonlocal in nature . while we have disregarded such approaches here , they will be ideal as a second stage whenever the apparent horizon needs to be determined to high precision .",
    "we concluded that for robustness the best algorithm is probably the ( generalized ) mean curvature flow suggested by tod @xcite , where an arbitrary initial surface evolves in an unphysical `` time '' towards the apparent horizon , turning the problem from an elliptic into a parabolic one .",
    "the algorithm is guaranteed to converge at least for time - symmetric ( @xmath147 ) data , and we have argued that it must be at least very robust also for @xmath325 data .",
    "unfortunately , numerical implementations of this algorithm face a numerical stability problem common to all parabolic equations , which make them slow , and increasingly so with increasing resolution , in practice .",
    "this stability or speed problem is not present in the algorithm of nakamura _ et al . _",
    "( nko ) @xcite .",
    "it is motivated by a standard way of solving nonlinear elliptic problems numerically , namely subtracting a simple linear elliptic operator from the nonlinear one , inverting it by pseudo - spectral methods and iterating .",
    "here we have thrown more light on how nko works , by making explicit the background metric it introduces , and by characterizing the iteration procedure as a specific finite differencing , in unphysical time , of a parabolic problem .",
    "this parabolic problem itself is the singular limit of a certain family of flows which are governed by a mixture of the physical geometry of the cauchy data and an unphysical background geometry .",
    "tod s flow is a different limiting case of that family , one in which no background metric appears .",
    "once we have recognized the existence of a continuum of possible algorithms between tod and nko , it is plausible that an algorithm somewhere in the middle of the continuum may be better than the extremes . by trial and error ,",
    "we have determined the optimal member of the family of algorithms .",
    "this intermediate algorithm evolves the high - frequency components ( the fine details ) of the trial ah essentially like the nko algorithm , but it evolves the low frequency components ( the rough shape ) by a variant of generalized mean curvature flow .",
    "we therefore call it `` fast flow '' .",
    "we have given details of a numerical implementation of the pseudo - spectral methods which are needed for implementing both the original nko and our new algorithm .",
    "such details have not been published before .",
    "it should be stressed that the formal analysis of the algorithm in sect .",
    "iii is independent from its implementation in sect .",
    "iv , and there may be different and more efficient implementations .      by construction ,",
    "the new algorithm is as fast as that of nko : the iteration steps are very similar , and there is the same small number of them .",
    "nko , however , updates @xmath100 ( the overall radius of the trial ah ) by a special procedure . according to how this is done @xcite",
    ", the additional overhead may be large .",
    "more importantly , the separate update of @xmath100 has the potential to reduce the robustness of nko : eqn .",
    "( [ a00 ] ) may have several solutions , in which case all should be investigated , or none , in which case minima should be investigated instead @xcite .",
    "this requires some decision - taking , which will be hard to automate , or instead an infinitely branching search .",
    "we have also argued that zeros of eqn .",
    "( [ a00 ] ) are hard to find .",
    "either nko or fast flow should be far more tolerant of initial guesses than the elliptic methods .",
    "the method of choice for robustness and elegance is clearly tod s mean curvature flow .",
    "the only question here is speed .",
    "we have argued that as a parabolic method this would be slow in the possible implementations known to us , but a quantitative comparison with the implementation of pasch @xcite would be interesting .",
    "the only existing algorithm directly accessible to the author is that of the ncsa / washu group @xcite .",
    "direct comparisons are planned in future realistic applications .",
    "the new algorithm seems to be more robust , though : it made the transition from two ahs to a single one in the family of brill - lindquist data summarized in table 1 without external input .",
    "this ability will be crucial for applying ah boundary conditions in the merger of two black holes when the computer code is on its own during a very large run .",
    "the ncsa / washu code has not been tested on a similar sequence of analytic initial data , but in some situations involving evolved black holes it presently requires some care in finding the correct horizon@xcite .",
