    "the euclidean 3-sphere @xmath0 admits compact embedded minimal surfaces of any genus @xcite . for simple examples like a great 2-sphere or the ( minimal ) clifford torus",
    "there is a smooth deformation through constant mean curvature ( ) surfaces with the same topology , which can be expressed in terms of changing radii . for other minimal tori , as well as higher genus compact embedded minimal surfaces in @xmath0 it might be useful to have a general deformation technique .",
    "we do this for the case of tori , and present a smooth topology preserving deformation for tori in @xmath0 in theorem  [ th : nocommon ] . by this theorem",
    "the moduli space of tori in @xmath0 is locally one dimensional .",
    "to get an idea of the global structure of the moduli space we turn to equivariant tori in @xmath0 @xcite , which are either flat or a truncation of some member of an associated family of a delaunay surface @xcite .",
    "we show that the moduli of equivariant tori in @xmath0 is a connected infinite graph whose edges are parameterized by the mean curvature , and by flowing through this moduli space of equivariant tori we classify the minimal , the embedded , and the alexandrov embedded tori therein .    amongst harmonic maps @xcite",
    "there is an important class consisting of harmonic maps of finite type @xcite . to a harmonic map of finite type there",
    "corresponds an associated algebraic curve whose compactification is called the spectral curve .",
    "the genus of the curve is called the spectral genus , and denoted by @xmath1 . the crucial fact that makes it possible to adapt the whitham deformation technique @xcite to the case of tori in @xmath0 , is that a torus in @xmath0 always has finite spectral genus @xcite .",
    "the spectral curve of a torus is a double cover of the riemann sphere with @xmath2 many branch points . during the deformation",
    "the spectral curve changes such that two branch points remain fixed , while the other @xmath3 branch points may move around .",
    "the closing conditions involve a choice of two double points on the real part of the spectral curve : we call these the sympoints , and to ensure that the topology of the surface stays intact during the deformation , the flow of the sympoints has to be controlled .    in the smooth deformation family of the clifford torus",
    "there is a @xmath4-family which allow a deformation into absolute cohomogeneity one rotational embedded tori .",
    "such a deformation is possible when in addition to the two sympoints there is a further double point on the real part of the spectral curve . by opening up this additional double point and moving the resulting two branch points off the real part",
    ", the spectral curve becomes a double cover of the riemann sphere branched now at four points : it has spectral genus @xmath5 and is the spectral curve of a delaunay surface , and the corresponding torus is a truncation of a delaunay surface in @xmath0 . we show that at the end of the flow the new branch points pair - wise coalesce with the two fixed branch points . hence in the limit the coalescing pairs of branch points disappear , and the limit curve is an unbranched double cover of the sphere : the spectral curve of a bouquet of spheres . in the rotational case , see also @xcite , our deformation corresponds to pinching the neck of a delaunay surface , starting at a flat torus and continuing through to a bouquet of spheres .",
    "thus the connected component of the clifford torus is an infinite comb : the spine ( @xmath6 ) consists of embedded flat tori parameterized by the mean curvature , and each tooth ( @xmath5 ) of embedded delaunay tori ends in a bouquet of spheres . by considering covers of clifford",
    "tori the moduli space of rotational tori is a @xmath7family of such combs .",
    "it turns out that each bouquet of spheres occurs exactly twice in this moduli space ( theorem  [ thm : sphere - bouquet ] ) , so that we may glue the two families together there .",
    "thus the moduli space of rotational tori in @xmath0 is an infinite connected graph .",
    "a similar picture transpires in the non - rotational case . in each isogeny class",
    "there is a sequence of @xmath6 tori that can be deformed into @xmath5 tori . in the non - rotational case",
    "a @xmath5 deformation family stays away from bouquets of spheres , and we prove that every @xmath5 deformation family begins and ends at a @xmath6 torus ( theorem  [ thm : moduli - space ] ) .",
    "the above results combined give that every deformation family of absolute cohomogeneity one tori ends at a flat torus .",
    "the classification of absolute cohomogeneity one tori is thus reduced to that of spectral curves of flat tori with a double point on the real part ; this initial data is classified and interpreted geometrically .",
    "we classify the equivariant minimal tori , as well as the embedded and alexandrov embedded equivariant tori , and prove that the minimal clifford torus is the only embedded minimal equivariant torus in the 3-sphere .",
    "we also show that the spectral curve of an equivariant torus has no double points off the real part ( theorem  [ th : no_equi_bub ] ) , which implies that there can not be a bianchi - bcklund transform of an equivariant torus into a torus .",
    "we conclude the paper by proving that the moduli space of equivariant tori in @xmath0 is connected . throughout the text we provide graphics of some of the surfaces under discussion .",
    "more images and videos of deformation families can be viewed at the website @xcite .",
    "we start by recalling the description of tori in terms of spectral curves and abelian differentials @xcite .",
