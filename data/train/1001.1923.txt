    "al @xcite shows good agreement with the experimental data only for 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 and 0.5 m of methanol feed .",
    "they found that for methanol feed concentrations greater than 0.5 m it was necessary another set of fitted kinetic parameters to model the polarization curve , and they suggest that this was caused by neglecting two - phase transport . in fact",

    "these solutions are applicable to the case of negligible cl proton resistance and one - dimensional transport .",
    "however , the equations obtained for the methanol concentration and local anodic current density profiles are not explicit functions of the position in the cl .",

    "because of this , analytical expressions for local anodic current density and methanol flux at the cl as function of local methanol concentration at the cl were derived .",
    "therefore , if the profile of local methanol concentration at the cl is known , then the local anodic current density and methanol flux at the cl profiles can be easily calculated by means of eqs .",
