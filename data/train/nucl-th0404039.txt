    "experiments of high energy @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 collisions are currently performed at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) in brookhaven national laboratory for comprehensive understanding of the highly hot / dense matter , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) . at collider energies , collisions of two relativistic nuclei",
    "involve many aspects of physics according to the relevant energy or time scale .",
    "there already exist many theoretical approaches to understand numerous rhic data .",
    "we consider in this work , particularly , the physics of the gluon saturation in a colliding nucleus , hydrodynamic evolution of produced matter , and the energy loss of hard partons in the medium .",
    "our goals are to combine them and to take a first step toward a unified understanding of the dynamical aspect of high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "first data reported by the star collaboration at rhic  @xcite revealed that the observed large magnitude of elliptic flow for hadrons is naturally explained by hydrodynamics .",
    "this suggests that large pressure possibly in the partonic phase is built at the very early stage ( @xmath6 fm/@xmath7 ) in au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "this is one of the strongest indications of early thermalization of the qgp at rhic  @xcite .",
    "these hydrodynamic predictions also give good agreements with mass dependences of the second harmonic coefficient of azimuthal distribution @xmath8 in the low @xmath1 region  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the case in the lower energy collisions where the hydrodynamics always overpredicts the data  @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamics also predicts that the scaled elliptic flow , which is defined as the second harmonics @xmath9 divided by initial spatial eccentricity @xmath10 , becomes almost constant around 0.2  @xcite .",
    "the experimental data reaches the hydrodynamic limit for the first time in central and semicentral collisions at rhic energies @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath9 as a function of pseudorapidity  @xcite can be reproduced by hydrodynamics only in @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "all these analyses indicate that a high dense matter created in heavy ion collisions at rhic energies achieves ( local ) thermal equilibrium state in the low @xmath1 region , around midrapidity , and up to semicentral collisions .",
    "on the other hand , jet production rate becomes large enough to measure high @xmath1 power - law tails at rhic .",
    "these minijets go across the expanding matter rather than participate in the dense medium in the case of heavy ion collisions . during traveling through the expanding medium ,",
    "energetic partons interact with soft matter and lose their energies dynamically ( jet quenching ) .",
    "thus , high @xmath1 hadrons coming from fragmentation of minijets can be good probes of the bulk matter  @xcite .",
    "it was observed that nuclear modification factors for hadrons in the high @xmath12 gev/@xmath7 region are considerably smaller than unity in central collisions  @xcite and that it increases with decreasing centrality and eventually reaches around unity in peripheral collisions .",
    "disappearance of the away - side peak in azimuthal correlation functions for high @xmath1 hadrons is also observed in central au+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "this can be described by perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) based parton models with parton energy loss in the dense medium  @xcite .",
    "cronin enhancement of the hadron spectra and existence of the back - to - back correlation at mid - rapidity in @xmath4 collisions at rhic  @xcite support that suppression of the yield and disappearance of the away - side peak in au+au collisions at mid - rapidity are due to the final state interaction .",
    "the radiative parton energy loss induced by the medium has been studied extensively  @xcite and found that the energy loss is proportional to the gluon rapidity density of the medium .",
    "theoretical analyses reveal that a large parton density is required to account for observed suppressions of single as well as dihadron spectra at rhic  @xcite .    from the above discussion",
    ", the current rhic data strongly suggest that the parton density created in heavy ion collisions at rhic is dense enough to cause both large elliptic flow of bulk matter and large suppression of high-@xmath1 hadrons .",
    "one of the important problems in the physics of heavy ion collisions is to reveal the origin of this dense matter .",
    "the bulk particle production in high energy hadronic collisions is dominated by the small @xmath13 modes in the nuclear wave function , where @xmath13 is a momentum fraction of the incident particles .",
    "therefore , an origin of the large density could be traced to the initial parton density at small @xmath13 inside the ultra - relativistic nuclei before collisions  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that gluon density increases rapidly with decreasing @xmath13 by the bfkl cascade until gluons begin to overlap in phase space  @xcite where nonlinear interaction becomes important .",
    "these gluons eventually form the color glass condensate ( cgc )  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is characterized by a  saturation scale \" @xmath14 which corresponds to the gluon rapidity density per unit transverse area .",
    "when @xmath14 is large ( @xmath15 ) , the coupling becomes weak ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "in addition , the gluon occupation number in the wave function is huge , @xmath17 .",
    "therefore this can be studied by an weak coupling classical method known as mclerran - venugopalan ( mv ) model  @xcite .",
    "it has been developed to compute the classical parton distributions of nuclei based on this model .",
    "moreover , renormalization group methods which systematically incorporate quantum corrections to the classical effective theory were developed  @xcite .",
    "there is an evidence for gluon saturation in deep inelastic scattering at hera .",
    "models based on the saturation picture fit the hera data well in the moderate @xmath18 and low @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "this effective theory can be applied to the collisions of nuclei and its solution can be used for initial conditions of further evolution of the system created in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "perturbative solutions of the gluon production for collisions of two nuclei  @xcite as well as @xmath19 collisions  @xcite have been computed .",
    "non - perturbative classical solutions of the yang - mills equations were also obtained by the real - time numerical simulations on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "the calculations based on the cgc picture have been compared to various rhic data .",
    "remarkably , the cgc results on the global observables , e.g. , the centrality , rapidity and energy dependences of charged hadron multiplicities agree with the rhic data under the assumption of parton - hadron duality  @xcite . the cgc picture is also applied for studies of particle correlations and azimuthal anisotropies  @xcite , and valence quark distributions at small-@xmath13  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the classical wave function in the mv model contains cronin enhancement and that quantum evolution with respect to @xmath13 makes the spectrum suppressed  @xcite .",
    "suppression of nuclear modification factor at forward rapidity region in @xmath4 collisions  @xcite in the cgc picture is also consistent with the recent rhic data  @xcite .",
    "the above facts show that the cgc , hydrodynamics , and the energy loss of hard partons are the key ingredients to describe the rhic physics .",
    "one expects that they are indeed closely related with each other .",
    "for example , the cgc could be a good initial condition for a thermalized state because it produces a large number of gluons .",
    "thus a large number of gluons are responsible for large suppression of jet spectra . in order to understand systematically the whole of the stages of relativistic heavy ion collisions , it is indispensable to construct a unified and dynamical framework in which the above different ideas are consistently incorporated . in this work ,",
    "we perform hydrodynamic simulations with the initial condition taken from the cgc and simulate parton energy loss in the fluid elements .",
    "this approach will lead us to get deeper understanding of the dynamical aspect of heavy ion collisions .",
    "in addition , some of the problems which are inherent in a particular approach can be removed .",
    "for instance , one conventionally parametrizes initial conditions in the hydrodynamic simulations shortly after a collision of two nuclei so as to reproduce final observed spectra .",
    "hydrodynamic framework itself does not provide an initial condition .",
    "hence one has to choose it from infinite possible candidates .",
    "any initial conditions which reproduce the final hadron spectra are equivalent , so it is hard to discard even one of them within the hydrodynamic approach .",
    "this is the ambiguity problem of hydrodynamic model in heavy ion collisions .",
    "a good example can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite : two completely different initial conditions end up almost the same rapidity distribution .",
    "therefore it is desired to take an initial condition which is obtained by a reliable theory .",
    "on the other hand , most of the calculations based on the cgc do not include final state interactions . according to estimation of initial parton productions from a classical lattice yang - mills simulation based on the cgc  @xcite ,",
    "the transverse energy per particle is roughly @xmath20 gev , while the experimental data yields @xmath21 gev @xcite .",
    "the elliptic flow from a classical yang - mills simulation is inconsistent with rhic data  @xcite .",
    "those discrepancies , which are mainly due to the lack of collective effects , will be removed by introducing further time evolutions through , e.g. , hydrodynamics .    for the calculation of parton energy loss ,",
    "one needs time evolution of parton density .",
    "bjorken expansion @xcite is assumed for the evolution of parton density in almost all work except ref .",
    "@xcite in which hydrodynamic simulations are used to estimate the energy loss of partons for the first time .",
    "we have previously established a model ( the hydro+jet model ) in which hydrodynamic evolutions are combined with explicitly traversing non - thermalized partons with large transverse momenta  @xcite . here",
    "the production of high @xmath1 partons is described by a pqcd parton model .",
    "these high @xmath1 partons come from parton distribution function in relatively large @xmath13 region .",
    "systematic studies based on the hydro+jet model have been performed for @xmath1 spectra @xcite , back - to - back correlation functions  @xcite , pseudorapidity dependence of nuclear modification factors  @xcite , and elliptic flow @xcite . for the initial condition of hydrodynamic simulations",
    ", we simply parametrized the initial shape of energy density in the previous work . instead",
    ", we will employ the cgc picture and use gluons produced from melting cgc for initial conditions for hydrodynamic simulations in this paper .",
    "the number and the energy density distributions for produced gluons are calculated from the @xmath0 factorization formula  @xcite .",
    "although the produced gluons will reach a thermalized state through the dissipative processes in the realistic situations , the description of non - equilibrium phenomena is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "instead , we assume thermalization for gluons produced from the cgc .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : hydrojet ] , we briefly summarize the hydro+jet model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] , we present hydrodynamic results on ( pseudo)rapidity distributions for charged hadrons and the transverse momentum distributions for pions , kaons , and protons .",
    "we show that the cgc provides good initial conditions in the hydrodynamic model .",
    "we also show that , with almost keeping the shape of rapidity distribution during the hydrodynamical evolution , transverse collective flow is generated by pressure gradient perpendicular to the collision axis .",
    "we study the centrality dependence of the nuclear modification factor for neutral pions and the back - to - back correlations for charged hadrons . the previous analysis on the high @xmath1 hadron spectra in the forward rapidity region is revisited . in the final section ,",
    "we give a summary and a discussion about the further improvements in our approach .",
    "there exists a lot of extensive work for the description of gluon productions in nuclear collisions in the saturation regime where nonlinear effects become important .",
    "perturbative solutions for the collision of two nuclei in the mv model were obtained in refs .",
    "however , those solutions are limited for the relatively high momentum and can not be used for the calculation of total gluon multiplicities . in ref .",
    "@xcite , analytic expression for the gluon multiplicity is obtained .",
    "non - perturbative classical boost invariant solutions are currently available on the lattice @xcite and it is highly desired to use the lattice results for obtaining reliable initial conditions . however , one of our purposes in this paper is to investigate the rapidity dependence of final hadrons .",
    "therefore , we employ the @xmath0 factorization formula along the line of work done by kharzeev , levin , and nardi ( kln )  @xcite for the computation of the gluon rapidity distribution which is to be the initial condition for sequential hydrodynamic evolution .      the number of produced gluons in the @xmath0-factorization formula is given by  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 and @xmath1 are a rapidity and a transverse momentum of a produced gluon .",
    "running coupling @xmath25 is evaluated at the scale @xmath26 .",
    "the unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath27 is related to the gluon density of a nucleus by @xmath28 there are several models / parametrizations in the literature which provide a gluon distribution in the saturation region . in principle , the @xmath13 dependence of unintegrated distribution functions in eq .",

    ", the gluon distribution below the saturation scale @xmath14 is logarithmically suppressed @xmath29 compared to the perturbative distribution @xmath30 . instead ,",
    "motivated by the kln approach , we use a simplified assumption about the unintegrated gluon distribution function : @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",

    "<S> we find that our results on the centrality dependence of nuclear modification factors for pions and back - to - back correlation for charged hadrons at midrapidity are consistent with the rhic data up to semicentral events . </S>",
