    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are close binary systems transferring matter from a low - mass dwarf secondary to a white dwarf .",
    "the transferred matter forms an accretion disk . in dwarf novae ,",
    "a class of cvs , the instability in the accretion disk produces outbursts .",
    "su uma - type dwarf novae , a class of dne , show superhumps during their long outbursts ( superoutbursts ) , whose period is generally a few percent longer than the orbital period .",
    "it is generally considered that the tidal instability in the accretion disk caused by the 3:1 resonance @xcite is responsible for the superhump and superoutburst phenomenon ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "[ for general information of cvs , dne , su uma - type dwarf novae and superhumps , see e.g. @xcite ] .    in a series of papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , we systematically surveyed su uma - type dwarf novae particularly laying emphasis on period variations of superhumps ( positive superhumps ; superhumps having periods longer than the orbital period ) , which has been the main theme since @xcite .",
    "the change in the superhump period reflects the precession angular velocity of the eccentric ( or flexing ) disk , and would be an excellent probe for studying the structure of the accretion disk during dwarf nova outbursts .",
    "in addition to the systematic survey of period variations of superhumps , we have studied properties of newly discovered wz sge - type dwarf novae [ for wz sge - type dwarf novae , see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] .    in the meantime ,",
    "there has been epoch - making progress in understanding the su uma - type phenomenon and interpreting the superhump period , and we review the history shortly .",
    "an anticipation of this new progress started with the analysis of kepler data of v344 lyr @xcite , who detected likely persistent negative superhumps in quiescence .",
    "@xcite studied the systematics of outburst in v344 lyr .",
    "@xcite analyzed the positive and negative superhumps in the same object .",
    "in @xcite , we analyzed the kepler data of v344 lyr and v1504 cyg in the same way we have used and compared them with other su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "this work led to two works , @xcite , @xcite , in which the thermal - tidal instability ( tti ) model @xcite has been proven to be the best explanation of the kepler observation . in particular , @xcite used the frequency of negative superhumps ( superhumps having periods shorter than the orbital period ) which are believed to arise from a tilted accretion disk ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) to derive the variation of the disk radius and directly confirmed the prediction of the tti model . @xcite",
    "further analyzed the frequency variation of the co - existing negative and positive superhumps , and confirmed that the variation of the disk radius predicted by the tti model gives a consistent explanation of the variation of the negative and positive superhumps .",
    "@xcite also introduced the pressure effect interpreting the periods of positive superhumps . although the pressure effect has been long known ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , there have been no direct applications to interpretation of period variation of ( positive ) superhumps during the superoutburst .",
    "the treatment of the pressure effect is difficult , and @xcite partly succeeded in interpreting the variation of the superhump period during the initial growing stage ( stage a ) and fully developed stage ( early stage b ) [ see @xcite for the notation of stages a - b - c of superhumps ] .",
    "this interpretation led to an important consequence : the precession frequency of the superhumps during the growing stage ( stage a ) corresponds to the dynamical precession rate at the radius of the 3:1 resonance .",
    "this interpretation enabled us to dynamically determine the binary mass - ratios ( @xmath2 ) only from superhump observations and the orbital period .",
    "this method has been indeed shown to be effective by comparisons with @xmath3 values by eclipse observations or radial - velocity studies @xcite .",
    "this method has been successfully used to characterize the wz sge - type dwarf novae with multiple rebrightenings @xcite and identifying the elusive period bouncers [ cvs evolved beyond the minimum orbital period during their secular evolution ; for a recent review of cv evolution , see e.g. @xcite ] @xcite .",
    "we should also note that our initial approximation in @xcite did not include the pressure effect and the disk radius was normalized to the radius of 3:1 resonance for the early phase of the stage b superhumps , and the resultant radii were systematically estimated larger in @xcite . since the qualitative estimation of the pressure effect during the superoutburst is still a difficult task ,",
    "we leave the understanding of the period variation of superhumps to future works .    in @xcite",
    ", we also made a pilot survey of variation of superhump amplitudes and indicated that the amplitudes of superhumps are strongly correlated with orbital periods , and the dependence on the inclination is weak in systems with inclinations smaller than 80@xmath4 . in @xcite , we systematically studied er uma - type dwarf novae [ see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ] , which has recently become a hot topic in the field of cataclysmic variable since the discovery of negative superhump even during the superoutburst @xcite and the possible identification of bk lyn  an object recently changed from a novalike variable to an er uma - type dwarf nova  with an ancient classical nova @xcite , shedding light on the evidence of the long - sought transition from classical novae to dwarf novae [ the hibernation model , see e.g. @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite also studied kepler data for dwarf novae v344 lyr , v1504 cyg , the background dwarf nova of kic 4378554 and v447 lyr .",
    "the work by @xcite tried to reproduce the outburst morphology by the pure thermal instability model [ see @xcite for a discussion on the difficulty of this model ] .",
    "@xcite and @xcite indicated that the presence of a `` shoulder '' in long outbursts of an ss cyg - type dwarf nova , which @xcite and @xcite considered to be analogous to the precursor outburst in su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "there was also a rapid progress in interpretation and numerical simulation of negative and positive superhumps , a part of which is associated with kepler observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    keeping the brand - new progress in dwarf novae in mind ,",
    "let s go onto the new observations .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ sec : obs ] describes the observation and analysis technique , section [ sec : individual ] deals with individual objects we observed , section [ sec : generaldiscuss ] discusses the general properties following @xcite and @xcite , section [ sec : fadingrate ] provides a new pilot survey of the decline rate during the superoutburst , which has led to a new promising method for identifying period bouncers , section [ sec : ogledne ] examined the recently reported new ogle dwarf novae , section [ sec : topics ] presents topics on some objects which show new types of behavior in dwarf novae , and finally section [ sec : summary ] is for the summary .",
    "the data were obtained under campaigns led by the vsnet collaboration @xcite . in some objects",
    ", we used the public data from the aavso international databasehttp://www.aavso.org / data - download@xmath5 . ] .",
    "the majority of the data were acquired by time - resolved ccd photometry by using 30 cm - class telescopes , whose observational details will be presented in future papers dealing with analysis and discussion on individual objects of interest .",
    "the list of outbursts and observers is summarized in table [ tab : outobs ] .",
    "the data analysis was performed just in the same way described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the times of all observations are expressed in barycentric julian dates ( bjd ) .",
    "we also used the same abbreviations : @xmath0 for the orbital period and @xmath6 for the fractional superhump excess .",
    "after @xcite , the alternative fractional superhump excess in the frequency unit @xmath7 has been introduced since this fractional superhump excess can be directly compared to the precession rate .",
    "we therefore used @xmath8 when referring the precession rate .",
    "we used phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ; @xcite ) for period analysis and 1@xmath9 errors for the pdm analysis was estimated by the methods of @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite , we introduced least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( lasso ) method ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which has been proven to be very effective in separating closely spaced periods .",
    "we have further extended this lasso analysis to two - dimensional power spectra ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these two - dimensional lasso power spectra have been sometimes helpful in detecting negative superhumps ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) as well as superhumps with varying frequencies ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    the derived @xmath10 , @xmath11 and other parameters",
    "are listed in table [ tab : perlist ] in same format as in @xcite .",
    "the definitions of parameters @xmath12 and @xmath11 are the same as in @xcite .",
    "we also presented comparisons of @xmath13 diagrams between different superoutbursts since this has been one of the motivations of these surveys ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we used the same terminology of superhumps summarized in @xcite .",
    "we especially call reader s attention to the term `` late superhumps '' .",
    "we only used `` traditional '' late superhumps when an @xmath140.5 phase shift is confirmed [ see also table 1 in @xcite for various types of superhumps ; the lack of an @xmath140.5 phase shift in v585 lyr in the kepler data has been also confirmed @xcite ] .",
    "early superhumps are double - wave humps seen during the early stages of wz sge - type dwarf novae , and have period close to the orbital periods ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we used the period of early superhumps as approximate orbital period , since their periods only differ by less than 0.1% ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "as in @xcite , we have used coordinate - based optical transient ( ot ) designations for some objects , such as catalina real - time transient survey ( crts ; @xcite)http://nesssi.cacr.caltech.edu / catalina/@xmath5 . for the information of the individual catalina cvs ,",
    "see @xmath15http://nesssi.cacr.caltech.edu / catalina / allcv.html@xmath5 . ]",
    "transients and listed the original identifiers in table [ tab : outobs ] .",
    "the crts team has recently provided the public data releasehttp://nesssi.cacr.caltech.edu / datarelease/@xmath5 . ] and provided the international astronomical union ( iau ) designations for the cataloged objects .",
    "we used these iau designations whenever available starting from the present paper .",

    "@xcite was the first to derive the time scale of this slow fading .",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 is the disk radius in a unit of 10@xmath26 cm and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "[ note that there are two different definitions of @xmath28 ( cf .",
    "subsection 4.3 in @xcite ) and @xmath28 here corresponds to @xmath28=0.2 in @xcite or @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite , @xcite discussed the dependence of this relation to system parameters , and obtained the following relation : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the kepler light curves of v344 lyr and v1504 cyg and compared the slow fading rate during the superoutburst with other su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "@xcite suggested from kepler observations that the fading rate has a much stronger dependence on the orbital period than equations ( [ equ : declinerateosaki ] ) ( [ equ : visdecay ] ) .",
    "@xcite postulated that this different could arise from the strong dependence of the viscosity in quiescence ( @xmath32 ) , that is , a smaller @xmath32 gives rise to a larger surface density at the start of the superoutburst and hence a steeper viscous decay .",
    "we examined this study by a more homogeneous survey of fading rates during the superoutburst of su uma - type dwarf novae , since there was only a limited number of ( not necessarily homogeneous ) samples listed in @xcite .",
    "we used the superoutburst data in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and this paper .",
    "we did not attempt a complete survey , but chose observations with high quality .",
    "we also did not attempt to survey the data in the literature which may be potentially useful .",
    "we also excluded deeply eclipsing systems since it is difficult to remove the effect of the eclipses and since these objects usually show a beat phenomenon .",
    "note that the data `` with high quality '' do not necessarily correspond to the data giving high - quality times of superhump maxima , and the qualification of the data does not agree to the data classification in the table of outburst observation ( such as table [ tab : perlist ] ) .",
    "we examined each light curve of a superoutburst ( after correcting the difference between different observers ) visually and identified the linear part to obtain the fading rate .",
    "some objects tend to brighten when stage c superhumps appear ( see also @xcite ) and we neglected this part .",
    "we here conveniently divided the objects into two categories : ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae and wz sge - type dwarf novae including candidate period bouncers .",
    "since there is no clearly dividing line between ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae and wz sge - type , we adopted the category in @xcite : the objects that show early superhumps , a manifestation of the 2:1 resonance , and/or the objects with large ( @xmath148 mag ) outburst amplitudes and long ( several to tens of years ) supercycle .",
    "the objects with frequent normal outbursts are not included in wz sge - type dwarf novae even if the amplitude satisfies this condition .",
    "the results are listed in tables [ tab : suumarate ] and [ tab : wzsgerate ] . unless new variable star designations were given , we used the names of the objects given in the references for reader s convenience .",
    "note that the errors given in the tables only refer to random errors , and the real errors should be larger due to systematic errors arising from a number of factors , such as poor zero - point calibration , difference between observers , variable weather condition , poor flat - fielding , atmospheric extinction and selection of the segment used for calculation .",
    "a comparison between different superoutbursts of the same object suggests an order of 0.010.02 mag d@xmath33 as the typical systematic error .",
    "although @xcite suggested a much steeper dependence of @xmath34 , our data on su uma - type dwarf novae do not show a significant deviation from equations ( [ equ : declinerateosaki ] ) ( [ equ : visdecay ] ) ( figure [ fig : sodecline ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence in @xmath35 was estimated to be @xmath360.38(0.13 ) , consistent with the predicted value @xmath37 by a 1@xmath9 level . for at least ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae",
    ", we do not need a special explanation for the deviation from this relation .",
    "the case of the difference between v344 lyr and v1504 cyg in @xcite appears to reflect the intrinsic difference between different objects , sinfec there appears to be a sufficient scatter among su uma - type dwarf novae in our sample .",
    "is is possibly related to the condition that v1504 cyg ( @xmath0=1.67 hr ) has an anomalously high outburst frequency , and hence has a higher mass - transfer rate than in other su uma - type dwarf nova with similar @xmath0 .",
    "it is not clear whether the long outburst of u gem @xcite can be compared to these results , partly because that the magnitudes of the comparison stars for u gem used in the 1980s were different from the modern @xmath38 magnitudes ( e.g. 9.0 mag for the modern @xmath38=9.51 star hd 64813 ) and the variation in the brighter part of the outburst was systematically underestimated .",
    "furthermore , the vsolj record suggests that there were two peaks in the light curve with a intervening temporary fading ( to 10 mag around 1985 october 1819 ) between them .",
    "this fading was recorded by a very skillful observer ( h. narumi ) . while two aavso observers recorded the same fading ( 10.5 mag on 1985 october 18 ) , other observers tended to give brighter magnitudes as before , which was likely a psychological bias .",
    "we thus regard this outburst of u gem was composed of two different parts and it is inadequate to estimate the linear fading rate .",
    "although there was also a suggestion that this outburst was a superoutburst with superhumps @xcite , @xcite questioned the statistical significance of the superhump detection .",
    "we also doubt the detection because the resultant period was 0.20  d , which was one fifth of the sampling interval of the same longitude and it could be easily produced by systematic errors . the poor quality of the comparison star sequence at that time and the lack of suitable comparison stars between 9.3 and 10.2 ( magnitudes used at the time of the 1985 observation ) made the detection of subtle variations such as superhumps by human eyes particularly difficult .",
    "there was likely a psychological bias as stated above , and visual observations under such adverse conditions should not be weighed too much .",
    "the other problem in @xcite is that they used the rapidly fading ( not linearly fading ) part of the wz sge - type outbursts .",
    "this part of the outburst is different from those of ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae in that it reflects the viscous depletion process of the high - mass disk @xcite and also this phase corresponds to early superhumps , which are different from ordinary superhumps .",
    "this part of wz sge - type outbursts therefore can not be directly compared to the linear decline rate in su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "our results in the linear part of the outbursts in wz sge - type dwarf novae are in good agreement with the @xmath1 dependence for objects with longer ( @xmath39  d ) , and these objects ( notably rz leo and v1251 cyg ) appear to have the same properties with the ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae . the fading rates for the systems with shorter @xmath0 appear to be smaller than what are expected for the @xmath1 dependence .",
    "we interpret that this is an effect of a smaller degree of removal of the angular momentum caused by the tidal instability as explained in the following subsection .",
    "our conclusion is that the linear fading part of wz sge - type dwarf novae are essentially the same as in those in ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae and there is no special need for a steep dependence of the quiescent viscosity on the orbital period ( nor the linear fading rate can not reflect the quiescent viscosity ) , though a subtle deviation exists in wz sge - type dwarf novae with small @xmath3 .      among the studied objects , ot j184228.1@xmath16483742 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and sssj122221.7@xmath23311523 @xcite have remarkably small slow fading rates compared to the objects with similar orbital periods .",
    "these objects are suggested to be candidate period bouncers , whose very low @xmath3 was inferred from the dynamical precession rates of the stage a superhumps ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we first consider the effect of the disk radius on the fading rate .",
    "since there is a relation @xmath40 [ equation ( [ equ : declinerateosaki ] ) ] , a larger disk would produce a slower fading .",
    "the binary separation @xmath41 is proportional to @xmath42 ( cf .",
    "equation 2.1b in @xcite ) .",
    "the radius of the 3:1 resonance also depends on @xmath3 as in the equation : @xmath43 combining these effects , the fading rate is 3.6% smaller in @xmath44 case than in @xmath45 case .",
    "this value is clearly insufficient to explain the observation .",
    "although the mass of the primary also matters with a dependence of @xmath46 , the known primary masses of short - period systems are confined to a relatively narrow region ( @xmath47=0.83 @xmath48 with an intrinsic scatter of 0.07 @xmath48 for systems with @xmath49  d , @xcite ) , and it is unlikely the main reason .",
    "we then consider the effect of the disk viscosity in the hot state .",
    "since the theoretical fading rate [ equations ( [ equ : declinerateosaki ] ) ( [ equ : visdecay ] ) ] is correlated to @xmath50 , we consider that @xmath50 is smaller in these candidate period bouncer . as shown in @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "the amplitudes of ordinary superhumps in these systems were small compared to those in ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "this likely reflects the very small tidal effect on the disk resulting from low @xmath3 .",
    "the small tidal effect produces a smaller degree of the removal of the angular momentum ( such as enhanced viscous dissipation in the compressed region , cf .",
    "@xcite ) due to the development of the tidal instability , and the net @xmath50 is expected to smaller than in higher-@xmath3 systems .",
    "the unusually slow fading rates may become a discriminative signature for candidate period bouncers .",
    "a recently discovered wz sge - type dwarf nova ot j075418.7@xmath16381225 ( = css130131:075419@xmath16381225 ) , which has an 8-mag amplitude despite the long ( 0.0716  d ) superhump period ( nakata et al . in preparation ) , showed a very slow fading rate [ 0.0189(3 ) mag d@xmath33 ] , and is also a good candidate for a period bouncer .",
    "ot j230425.8 + 062546 @xcite also showed a slow fading rate [ 0.0340(4 ) mag d@xmath33 for the entire plateau , 0.061(1 ) mag d@xmath33 if we restrict the portion ( bjd after 24455573.5 ) after the change in the superhump period ] despite its relatively long ( 0.06630.0672  d ) superhump period .",
    "this object also may be a candidate period bouncer .",
    "most of the objects with multiple rebrightenings ( uz boo , eg cnc , dy cmi , vx for , ez lyn , master ot j211258.65@xmath16242145.4 , 1rxs j023238.8@xmath23371812 ) showed the fading rates similar to those of ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae with the corresponding superhump periods .",
    "we should note , however , that we selected the linear part of the light curve as in ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "at least one of the object with multiple rebrightenings ( vx for ) appeared to show a slower fading part before this linear part , and the inclusion of the slower part would produce a smaller fading rate as those of candidate period bouncers .",
    "we did not include this slower fading part because this object was observed in high air - mass and the mean magnitudes were not very well calibrated , which may have produced an artificial trend .",
    "the only two wz sge - type objects ot j111217.4@xmath23353829 and master ot j203749.39@xmath16552210.3 showed smaller fading rates .",
    "the former is a wz sge - type dwarf nova without a detected rebrightening @xcite and the latter showed multiple rebrightenings .",
    "the present result seems to favor the recent suggestion that object showing multiple rebrightenings are not considered to be good candidates for period bouncers @xcite .",
    "the results for the systems with secondaries having an evolved core are summarized in table [ tab : evolvedrate ] . since equation ( [ equ : declinerateosaki ] ) only weakly depends on @xmath3 , the decline rate for these ultrashort-@xmath0 objects",

    "the relatively slow decline rate of this object may be explained as in the same way as wz sge - type dwarf novae .      in @xcite",
    ", we reported three systems with unusually low - amplitude superhumps .",
    "these systems apparently showed closely separated two periods , one of which is likely the superhump period .",

    "both cc scl and ot j072948.66@xmath16593824.4 showed usual decline rates comparable to the systems with similar @xmath10 .",
    "ot j173516.9@xmath16154708 , however , showed a very slow decline rate .",
    "although only a limited segment of the light curve was recorded , this decline rate might suggest a candidate period bouncer .",
    "quite recently , @xcite reported detection of a number of dwarf novae in the ogle - iii data .",
    "they reported a number of `` su uma - type dwarf novae '' having supercycles in the range of 2090  d , and claimed that there is no gap in the distribution of supercycles between ( ordinary ) su uma - type dwarf novae and er uma stars .",
    "since this conclusion is against our knowledge based on which we compiled the present series of papers starting with @xcite , we here examine the validity of their claim .",
    "we also checked superhump periods reported in @xcite and tried to interpret the data referring to the superhump stages by our definition .",
    "the results are not included in table [ tab : perlist ] .",
    "we used the public available electronic data for these objects .",
    "as stated in @xcite , this object showed four post - superoutburst rebrightenings . in the light curve",
    ", there was a jump around bjd 24541772454178 .",
    "this jump most likely corresponds to the growth of ordinary superhumps ( cf .",

    "although early superhumps were expected before this jump , we could not detect a convincing signal .",
    "the duration of this phase was only 6  d , which is much shorter than those of ordinary wz sge - type dwarf novae ( see a discussion of the implication in @xcite ) .",
    "we obtained the mean superhumps period of 0.08083(2 )  d using the 2007 and 2008 superoutbursts , assuming the common period and independent phases between them .",
    "an interesting point is that there was a precursor 10  d preceding the 2008 superoutburst .",
