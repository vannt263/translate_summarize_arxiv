    "the mechanism leading to the s - m transition for hse calculations is similar as the pbe calculations ( fig .",
    "in addition , similar to pbe , the s - m transition in this case is completely reversible . interestingly , even at @xmath15 strain , the interlayer interaction reduces the bandgap ( @xmath55 0.67 ev ) compared to monolayer .",
    "this bandgap reduction is much higher than the other vdw - layer materials  @xcite .",

    "[ fig:4](a ) ) and electrons ( fig .  [ fig:4](b ) ) , the effective masses along the @xmath35-y direction are significantly higher than those along @xmath35-x , implying a high anisotropy in the system . on application of nc strain , the effective masses along @xmath35-y ( @xmath35-x ) decrease ( increase ) .",
    "the reason for this increase / decrease can be attributed to the decrease / increase in the curvature of the bands caused by the decrease / increase in the overlap of the bonding ( holes)/antibonding ( electrons ) orbitals .",

    "the high curvature in the energy surface for @xmath78 , suggests that it is difficult to apply strain along the @xmath11-direction compared to @xmath10 , also indicating that @xmath76 is higher compared to @xmath75 .",

    "we find that for a given charge carrier , @xmath83 , whereas , along a particular direction , the relationships are @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "hence , the overall trends in mobilities ( table s2 ) are controlled by the trends in effective masses and deformation potentials .",

    "while all the three different modes show qualitatively , the same behavior with respect to applied strain and exhibit a linear increase ( blue shift ) , the rate of increase is different for different modes .",

    "the bandgap can be reversibly tuned within a large energy range from 1.32 ev to 0 ev .",
    "we demonstrate that strong interlayer interactions between phosphorus-@xmath45 orbitals causes the s - m transition under nc strain .",
    "an estimate of the effect of nc strain on transport properties through the computation of carrier effective mass and mobility shows that the transport properties do not change significantly as a function of strain .",
