    "much progress has been made in the past few years regarding the spectral evolution of gamma - ray bursts .",
    "early studies described the time evolution of a single hardness parameter in typically fewer than 20 bursts [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "use of the batse lad data has allowed time - resolved spectroscopy of approximately one hundred bursts [ 4 ] .",
    "it has become clear that the time - integrated spectra is not at all representative of the time - resolved spectra [ 5,6 ] .",
    "several new trends have also been found in analyses of the time - resolved spectra . in particular , liang & kargatis [ 7 ] discovered a unique relationship between @xmath1 ( the energy at which the @xmath2 spectrum is a maximum ) and the photon fluence @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 represents an effective cooling constant .",
    "it was also reported that @xmath5 appeared to be invariant from pulse to pulse within some multipulse bursts [ 7 ] .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows an example of this observed invariance in cooling rate for grb 921207 as seen by batse lad 0 .",
    "if the decay of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath6 is assumed to be the radiative cooling of a plasma , then energy conservation dictates a proportionality between @xmath5 and the number of cooling leptons in the plasma [ 7 ] .",
    "this in turn suggests that multiple pulses observed within a single burst originate from the same plasma .",
    "verification of the observed `` cooling rate invariance '' would have serious implications on gamma - ray burst models .",
    "a scenario in which a single plasma emits several pulses of radiation is difficult to reconcile with many catastrophic burster models [ 8 ] . as a strict test of the conclusions of liang & kargatis [ 7 ]",
    "we determine the probability that the degree of invariance that they observed in their bursts would originate from bursts with no intrinsic invariance at all .",
    "as described below , this probability is high enough to raise doubts about any intrinsic invariance .",
    "liang & kargatis [ 7 ] fitted exponential decays of @xmath1 with respect to fluence @xmath6 in multipulse bursts and reported that the decay constant @xmath7 did not change from pulse to pulse in many of their bursts .",
    "we tested this conclusion by randomly sampling values from the observed distribution of @xmath7 .",
    "examining the first pulse of 57 bursts , we found that we can approximate this distribution as @xmath8 ergs @xmath9 .",
    "we also assigned a @xmath10-confidence region for each random value of @xmath7 based on the observed distribution @xmath11 .    in",
    "selecting the @xmath1 decays manually , it is likely that some systematic bias occurs favoring the trends we are looking for , namely well fit decays with similar decay rates . to account for this",
    ", we used two different methods for selecting pulse decays . for the case",
    "we designate `` best '' , we selected the decay phases of pulses by directly examining plots of @xmath1 versus @xmath6 .",
    "for the case we designate `` worst '' , we instead selected decay phases by examining plots of photon flux versus time . in both cases , however , we fit out exponential decay to @xmath1 versus @xmath6 . thus ,",
    "in the `` worst '' case scenario , we have blindly selected what portions of the @xmath12 plot will be fit . occasionally , there are some pulses where @xmath1 may actually be rising with respect to @xmath5 in what was chosen to be a decay phase .",
    "we discard these instances of `` negative decay '' .",
    "what is left serves as an _ extreme _ limit of what our final results would have been without our systematic bias .",
    "we compared two of each bursts m pulses at a time using @xmath13^{2 } }                            { \\sigma_{\\phi_{0}(i)}^{2 } + \\sigma_{\\phi_{0}(j)}^{2}}\\ ] ] and then distilled the comparisons within each burst into a single statistic to represent that burst ( see table [ table1 ] for definitions ) .",
    "each of these statistics are tailored for different null hypotheses . the statistic @xmath14 tests",
    "if _ at least _ two pulses in a burst are similar ( and thus `` invariant '' ) , while @xmath15 tests if _ all _ the pulses have a similar decay constant .",
    "@xmath16 tests for either a single good pairing or several moderately close pairings .",
    "we believe that this last statistic is the most reasonable for testing our results since it does not require that _ all _ pulses decay at the same rate ( as @xmath15 does ) but also does not discard information about multiple pulses repeating ( as @xmath14 does ) . finally , we calculated a table of probabilities p@xmath17 for our goodness - of - fit statistics @xmath18 based on random sampling from our distributions of @xmath5 and @xmath19 .",
    "[ table1 ]    lll & `` best '' selection & `` worst '' selection +   + p(@xmath20 ) &",
    "0.065 & 0.26 +   + p(@xmath21 ) & 0.0014 & 0.13 +   + p(@xmath22 ) & 0.012 & 0.12 +   +    we define p@xmath17 to be the probability of randomly getting a value of @xmath18 or lower if we compare @xmath23 pulses drawn randomly from the global distribution of @xmath7 . examining the distibution of p values for our sample of 40 `` best '' multipulse bursts , we found k - s probabilities of @xmath24 that the observed `` repetitions '' occur by chance [ 9 ] .",
    "this number is much higher ( @xmath25 ) if we remove our selection systematics .",
    "these high probabilities suggest that the observed invariance in cooling rate is not physical .",
    "an invariant cooling rate for pulses in multipulse gamma - ray bursts is certainly an exciting possibility .",
    "proof of such a pattern would place hard limits on burst emission mechanisms .",
    "liang and kargatis [ 7 ] found that 7 out of the 12 multipulse bursts in their sample were consistent with an invariant decay ( difference @xmath26 ) .",
    "however , using our `` best '' selection and the @xmath14 goodness - of - fit measure , we expect to randomly get @xmath27 bursts out of 12 consistent with having an invariant decay .",
    "we conclude that no intrinsic invariance of @xmath5 is required to explain the observations reported in liang and kargatis [ 7 ] .",
    "the observed `` repeating '' cooling rates are consistent with being randomly selected from the observed distribution of @xmath5 values . while these new results do not necessarily rule out cooling rate invariance in some bursts",
    ", they do show that the observations as an ensemble do not require such an invariance .",
