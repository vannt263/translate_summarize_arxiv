    "it is one of the important subjects in nuclear physics and astrophysics to determine the nuclear symmetry energy at various densities .",
    "constraints on the symmetry energy at densities lower than the normal density @xmath5 have been obtained to some degree from nuclear physics experiments @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions are believed to be useful to investigate the symmetry energy at high densities .",
    "in fact , in central collisions at several hundred mev / nucleon , transport calculations show that the maximum density around @xmath6 is reached when the system is compressed in an early stage of the reaction .",
    "the ratio of the neutron and proton densities in the compressed part is naturally sensitive to the symmetry energy at high densities @xcite .",
    "however , it is necessary to understand the link between the effects in the compression stage and the final observables , in order to extract the high - density symmetry energy from experimental data available at present and in future .",
    "the @xmath7 ratio has been proposed to be a good probe to constrain the high - density behavior of the symmetry energy  @xcite . in heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "the pions are produced through the @xmath1 resonance formation in the nucleon - nucleon collisions that typically occur at early times in the compressed part of the system . if all the pions produced by the @xmath8 process are directly emitted , the expected ratio should be @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the numbers of neutrons and protons that are relevant for the @xmath1 production . in another case of chemical equilibrium for @xmath12 and @xmath13 reactions at a temperature @xmath14 , the ratio @xmath15 @xcite , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the neutron and proton chemical potentials , may also be related to the neutron and proton densities @xmath18 or the symmetry energy @xcite .",
    "we also notice the relation @xmath19 ^ 2 $ ] when the neutron and proton phase - space densities are compared at the same single - particle energy @xmath20 satisfying @xmath21 .",
    "thus , both in these extreme cases , the @xmath4 ratio is related to some kind of neutron - to - proton squared ratio @xmath3 which is then supposed to be sensitive to the symmetry energy at high densities .    some theoretical studies have been performed by different transport models to investigate the sensitivity of pion observables  @xcite . at present , however , some of these results are contradicting to each other even qualitatively .",
    "the symmetry - energy dependence of the @xmath4 ratio in ref .",
    "@xcite is opposite to that predicted by refs .",
    "@xcite , while ref .",
    "@xcite predicts that the @xmath4 ratio for the total pion multiplicities does not depend on the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "moreover , the @xmath7 ratio in central au + au collisions measured by the fopi collaboration  @xcite is actually larger than the squared neutron - to - proton ratio of the total system , @xmath22 , at low energies such as at 400 mev / nucleon . since the compressed part naturally becomes less neutron rich than the total system , we inevitably have @xmath23 , and therefore @xmath7 can not agree with @xmath3 , contradicting to the arguments in the previous paragraph , as long as @xmath24 is identified with the density ratio @xmath18 in the compressed part as is typically done in the literature .",
    "most of the transport calculations underestimate the measured pion ratio , but some recent calculations @xcite predict the ratio as high as the experimental data .",
    "nevertheless , investigations can not be found in the literature on the mechanism to increase the pion ratio . hence , our understanding of the pion ratio in relation to the symmetry energy and the nucleon dynamics is not complete particularly when we need to have a precise description to explain the absolute magnitude of @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    ", we study the pion production in central collisions of neutron - rich nuclei @xmath0 at 300 mev / nucleon , which is one of the systems to be measured at ribf / riken  @xcite .",
    "we develop and employ a new approach by combining the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd )  @xcite and a hadronic cascade model ( jam )  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of neutrons and protons is solved by amd , and then pions and @xmath1 resonances in the reaction process are handled by jam .",
    "amd calculations were performed for several cases with and without cluster correlations @xcite , and with two effective interactions corresponding to different density dependences of the symmetry energy .",
    "these different cases of amd calculation yield different dynamics of neutrons and protons .",
    "the main aim here is to utilize these different cases to identify how the @xmath1 resonances and the emitted pions carry the information of the nucleon dynamics .",
    "we will also see the impacts of cluster correlations as well as of the high - density symmetry energy on the nucleon dynamics and consequently on the pion ratio .",
    "in order to understand the @xmath4 enhancement mechanism and to extract high - density symmetry energy , we need a reliable transport model of nucleons , clusters , @xmath1 resonances and pions .",
    "amd has been demonstrated to be a reliable transport model of nucleon and clusters  @xcite .",
    "it takes account of nucleon mean field effects , two - nucleon elastic scatterings , event - by - event fluctuations and antisymmetrization of nucleon wave functions .",
    "all of these ingredients could affect the @xmath24 ratio during the collision , and thus have influences on the @xmath4 ratio .",
    "one can explain fragment mass distribution in heavy - ion collisions precisely , especially with cluster correlations .",
    "in the present amd code , however , @xmath1 resonances and pions have not been incorporated . on the other hand ,",
    "jam is a reliable hadron transport model  @xcite .",
    "it has been successfully applied to @xmath25 and @xmath26 collisions in the energy range from 1 gev / nucleon to 158 gev / nucleon .",
    "we can describe hadron production spectra in jam , and collective flows are also explained with the mean field effects switched on @xcite . by comparison ,",
    "antisymmetrization of nucleon wave functions is not included , and cluster correlation during the time evolution are not implemented . at present , there is no transport model which includes all of the above mentioned important ingredients ; mean field effects , two - body collisions including elastic and inelastic processes , event - by - event fluctuations , antisymmetrization of nucleon wave functions , and dynamical cluster correlations .",
    "thus one of the best ways would be to combine amd and jam  nucleon transport in amd and particle production in jam .",
    "we consider here a transport model which describes the reaction dynamics by the time evolution of one - body density matrices or corresponding phase - space distributions @xmath27 , where the index @xmath28 stands for the particle species such as nucleons ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath1 resonances ( @xmath1 ) and pions ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "it should be implicitly understood that the isospin ( and spin ) components of these particles are also distinguished by @xmath28 .",
    "the coupled equations for @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) can be written in general as @xmath32+i_\\alpha[f_n , f_\\delta , f_\\pi]\\ ] ] with the mean - field term @xmath33 and the collision term @xmath34 , both of which depend on the phase - space distributions of all the particles at the time @xmath35 in general .",
    "the collision term includes at least the following processes @xmath36    now we limit our consideration to the sub - threshold or near - threshold cases where only a small number of @xmath1 production processes occur because the incident energy is not so high .",
    "then we expect that the @xmath1 production can be treated perturbatively .",
    "if the perturbation parameter @xmath37 is multiplied to the probability of the @xmath38 process , @xmath1 resonances and pions will appear in the first order of @xmath37 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the zeroth order equation for the nucleon distribution @xmath41 is @xmath42+i_n^{(\\lambda=0)}[f_n^{(0)},0,0],\\ ] ] where the collision term @xmath43 includes only the elastic @xmath44 scatterings .",
    "the distributions of @xmath1 resonances and pions can be solved by @xmath45 + i_\\delta[f_n^{(0)},f_\\delta , f_\\pi ] , \\label{eq : fdelta } \\\\",
    "\\frac{\\partial f_\\pi}{\\partial t } & = \\dot{f}^{\\text{mf}}_\\pi[f_n^{(0)},f_\\delta , f_\\pi ] + i_\\pi[f_n^{(0)},f_\\delta , f_\\pi ] , \\label{eq : fpi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are correct up to the first order of @xmath37 .",
    "the equation ( [ eq : fn0 ] ) for the zeroth order of the nucleon distribution can be solved assuming a system composed of only nucleons without considering productions of other particles . in our present approach ,",
    "we solve the nucleon dynamics by amd @xcite .",
    "then , for the calculated @xmath46 , the equations ( [ eq : fdelta ] ) and ( [ eq : fpi ] ) for @xmath1 resonances and pions are solved by another transport model jam @xcite which can handle particle productions .",
    "the information of nucleons in the jam calculation is always replaced by @xmath46 calculated by amd . namely the particle production is calculated by jam based on the nucleon dynamics calculated by amd .",
    "the above treatment violates some conservation laws in the higher orders @xmath47 .",
    "the result may be improved by introducing corrections for the conservation laws of baryon number , change and energy , modifying the nucleon information @xmath46 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fdelta ] ) and ( [ eq : fpi ] ) . when a @xmath1 resonance exists in the jam calculation , it should have been produced by a collision of two nucleons .",
    "such a pair of two nucleons is chosen in the amd calculation by taking into account the distance from the @xmath1 resonance , the phase space to produce a @xmath1 resonance , and the charge conservation condition .",
    "then one of the two nucleons is annihilated ( assuming that it is replaced by the @xmath1 resonance ) and the charge and the momentum of the other nucleon is modified for the charge and energy conservations . in the pion case , we consider only the charge conservation by modifying the charge of a nucleon for each pion if necessary .",
    "we have checked the validity of this prescription by comparing two different calculations performed by the jam code .",
    "the first calculation is done as in the amd - jam calculation described above but eq .",
    "( [ eq : fn0 ] ) is solved also by jam by turning off all the inelastic @xmath48 collisions .",
    "the result is compared with the standard jam calculation which solves all the particles as usual . with the present prescription for the conservation laws ,",
    "the pion multiplicities and the pion ratios in the two calculations agree well within the errors of about 10% and 2% , respectively , at the incident energy 300 mev / nucleon .",
    "these agreements get worse slightly at the incident energy 400 mev / nucleon .",
    "amd @xcite describes the dynamics of a many - nucleon system by the time evolution of a slater determinant of gaussian wave packets @xmath49 where the wave packet centroid is denoted by @xmath50 which is a complex vector , and the spin - isospin state @xmath51 takes @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the width parameter is chosen to be @xmath56 as usual .",

    "the mean field term @xmath61 $ ] is given by the equation of motion for the wave packet centroids @xmath62 derived from the time - dependent variational principle .",
    "in the present calculations , we employ the skyrme sly4 force @xcite as the effective interaction with the spin - orbit term omitted .",
    "the corresponding nuclear - matter incompressibility is @xmath63 mev at the saturation density @xmath64 .",
    "the nuclear - matter symmetry energy at @xmath5 is @xmath65 mev with the slope parameter @xmath66 mev ( called ` asy - soft ' or soft symmetry energy in sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] ) . in order to study the effect of the density dependence of the symmetry energy ,",
    "we also perform calculations with a force obtained by changing the density dependent term in the sly4 force @xmath67 to @xmath68 by choosing @xmath69 , we have a force corresponding to @xmath70 mev ( callded ` asy - stiff ' or stiff symmetry energy ) with the same equation of state of symmetric nuclear matter and with the same @xmath71 as the original sly4 force .",
    "the skyrme - type prarametrization of the effective interaction is advantageous for the efficient amd computation .",
    "however , the skyrme forces have a quadratic momentum dependence of the mean field which is not valid at high energy collisions at several hundred mev / nucleon .",
    "therefore , the momentum dependence is corrected for the present calculations in a similar way to ref .",

    "a two - nucleon collision is treated as a stochastic transition from an amd state @xmath73 to another amd state @xmath74 specified by the relative momentum between the scattered two nucleons @xmath75 .",
    "the transition rate is expressed as @xmath76 in general , medium modification is introduced for the scattering matrix elements . however , in the present calculations , we employ the matrix elements in the free space .",
    "it should be noted that some medium effect still exists in the @xmath77-dependence of the final state energy @xmath78 in a similar way to a buu calculation of ref .",

    "are changed in the final state @xmath74 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the precise description of the method which employs ` physical coordinates ' ) . on the other hand ,",
    "an extension has been introduced @xcite to allow direct formation of light clusters with @xmath79 and 4 in the final state @xmath74 .",
    "namely , in the calculation with cluster correlations , when two nucleons @xmath80 and @xmath81 collide , we consider the process @xmath82 in which each of the scattered nucleons @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) may form a cluster @xmath85 with a spectator particle @xmath86 .",
    "this process includes the collisions without cluster formation as the special case of @xmath87 with empty @xmath86 .",
    "the transition rate of the cluster - forming process is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : transitionrate ] ) with the suitable choice of the final state @xmath74 .",
    "when a cluster is formed , the corresponding wave packets are placed at the same phase - space point , i.e. , the cluster internal state is represented by the harmonic - oscillator @xmath88 configuration . denoting the initial and final states of the @xmath89 system by @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively , we have the transition rate @xmath92 where @xmath93 are the states after the momentum transfer @xmath94 to the nucleons @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) , and @xmath75 is the relative momentum between @xmath80 and @xmath81 in these states .",
    "the matrix element @xmath95 is the same as for the usual two - nucleon collisions .",
    "we use an average value of @xmath95 evaluated at @xmath77 and that evaluated at the initial relative momentum .",
    "the actual situation of a two - nucleon collision requires more considerations because there are many possible ways of forming a cluster for each @xmath10 of the scattered nucleons @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "for a scattered nucleon @xmath10 , we first consider the possibility that @xmath10 may form a cluster with one of the nucleons @xmath96 which have the same spin - isospin state .",
    "this spin - isospin state that is studied first is randomly decided .",
    "the cluster - formed state is denoted by @xmath97 which is obtained , by first changing the state to @xmath98 by the momentum transfer @xmath99 to @xmath10 , and then moving the two wave packets of @xmath10 and @xmath100 to the same phase - space point without changing their center of mass . since",
    "the different final states are not orthogonal @xmath101 , the probability that @xmath10 forms a cluster with one of @xmath102 should be calculated as @xmath103 this probability is calculated with an approximation that the many - body state is a direct product of wave packets centered at the ` physical coordinates ' @xcite . with the calculated probability @xmath104 , a cluster will be formed with one of @xmath102 .",
    "it is somewhat arbitrary which one of @xmath102 should be chosen with what probability . in the present calculation , we choose @xmath100 with the relative weight @xmath105 with the parameter @xmath106 . with the rest of the probability ( @xmath107 ) , @xmath10 does not form a cluster with a nucleon of this spin - isospin state .",
    "the procedure is repeated for other spin - isospin states for @xmath102 .",
    "the particle @xmath10 should be regarded as a cluster , instead of a scattered nucleon , if a ( sub)cluster has been already formed in previous steps of the repetition .",
    "thus the formation of light clusters is considered up to an @xmath28 particle .",
    "this procedure determines the probability @xmath108 for the combination of final clusters @xmath109 as a function of the momentum transfer @xmath99 or @xmath75 .",
    "it satisfies the normalization @xmath110 .",

    "( [ eq : transitionrate - cluster ] ) should be replaced by @xmath108 .    even when the cluster formation is introduced , the many - body state is always represented by an amd wave function which is a slater determinant of nucleon wave packets .",
    "the time evolution of the many - body state is solved just as usual without depending on whether some of the wave packets form clusters due to collisions in the past ( except for the cluster - cluster binding process in the next paragraph ) .",
    "this is in contrast to buu by danielewicz _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite where clusters are treated as new particle species . in our approach , a nucleon in a formed cluster may collide with some other nucleon so that the cluster is broken",
    ". it may be the case that the scattered nucleon forms the same cluster as before , so that an elastic scattering of the cluster is possible .",
    "all of these kinds of processes are based on the nucleon - nucleon scattering matrix elements , without introducing parameters to control individual channels of cluster formation . in the present calculations with cluster correlations , however , the overall cluster production probability is suppressed , when the momentum transfer is extremely small , by a factor @xmath112 $ ] .",
    "it has been found that we should take account of the correlations to form heavier fragments via coalescence of light clusters on top of the usual time evolution of amd @xcite .",
    "this option of improvement has been turned on in the present calculations even though it will not strongly influence the following discussions in high energy collisions .",
    "the details are described in appendix [ sec : coacc ] for completeness .",
    "it is experimentally clearly known that the clusters are important in many situations of heavy - ion collisions even though the incident energy is relatively high .",
    "for example , the fopi data @xcite show that only 21% of the total protons in the au + au system are emitted as free protons in central collisions at 250 mev / nucleon , and all the other protons are bound in light clusters and heavier fragments .",
    "amd without cluster correlations overestimates the proton multiplicity as many other transport models do . on the other hand",
    ", the amd calculation with cluster correlations can reproduce this feature very well as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for systems including the au + au central collisions at several hundred mev / nucleon .",
    "therefore , the calculation with clusters is believed to be much closer to the realistic case than without clusters . in the following section , however , we are going to show the results of both calculations with and without clusters , which are useful for the purpose to study the dependence of the pion production on the nucleon dynamics .",
    "the information of nucleon dynamics calculated by amd is sent to the jam calculation in the form of a set of test particles @xmath113 , @xmath114,  ,@xmath115 .",
    "one test particle per nucleon is generated following the distribution function defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : amd - wigner ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that all kinds of quantum effects from the antisymmetrization of the many - body state are contained in this distribution function ( or the wigner function ) . in particular , it is not positive definite , and therefore in the phase - space region of @xmath116 the probability has to be replaced by zero , which can potentially introduce some inaccuracy of the test - particle representation . to check the accuracy , we compared the density profile for the ground state of the au nucleus , to find no visible difference between the distribution of the generated test particles and the exact density profile . therefore , this method of test particles should be sufficiently accurate in highly excited situations during heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the method to generate the test particles is described in appendix  [ appc ] .",
    "the set of test particles is sent to the jam calculation at every 2 fm/@xmath117 .",
    "we have checked that the result does not change when it is sent at every 1 fm/@xmath117 .",
    "the amd calculation is much more time consuming than other transport models such as jam .",
    "we typically generated 1000 amd events for each case of the present calculations .",
    "however , we improve the statistics for the pion production by generating 500 jam events from the same amd event . as we will see in the next section , a sufficient statistical accuracy is obtained for the pion production with this limited number of amd events .",
