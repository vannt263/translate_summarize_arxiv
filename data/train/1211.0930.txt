    "at high temperature , a pure @xmath0 gauge theory undergoes a phase transition from a confining phase to a phase which is deconfining in nature . while a perturbative analysis is appropriate at very high temperatures , where the physics is that of an asymptotically free gas of gluons , this is not the case at lower temperatures , where non - perturbative effects show up and make the perturbative analysis fail .",
    "one of the impacts of the non - perturbative physics arising from the magnetic sector is that the pseudo - potential extracted from spatially oriented wilson loops is linear at large distances @xcite .",
    "an important example to which this applies is a rectangular wilson loop of size @xmath1 , oriented in the @xmath2-plane . in this case",
    "the expectation value of the loop is    @xmath3    @xmath4 is called the pseudo - potential if the corresponding contribution dominates the sum as @xmath5 . if so , then the other @xmath6 s are called hybrid pseudo - potentials .",
    "the pseudo - potential at finite temperature has been intensively studied in the past decades . in particular ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the spatial string tension @xmath7 was calculated on the lattice for @xmath8 and @xmath9 gauge groups @xcite .",
    "this showed the expected dependence on the magnetic scale and also established a relation to the string tension of a @xmath10-dimensional gauge theory .",
    "the latter is essential for another approach based on a dimensionally reduced gauge theory .    on the other hand , nothing is known on the hybrid pseudo - potentials @xmath6 at finite temperature .",
    "the situation here is quite different from that of the hybrid potentials , in that the hybrid potentials were calculated from the generalized temporal wilson loops on the lattice as well as from four - dimensional effective string models @xcite .",
    "an alternative route to studying these objects is an effective string theory in higher dimensions which is motivated by the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "in this paper we continue a series of studies @xcite devoted to the spatial wilson loops within a five(ten)-dimensional effective string theory . in @xcite ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the spatial string tension of an @xmath0 gauge theory without quarks was computed . for @xmath11",
    "the result is remarkably consistent with the lattice data for @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "subsequent work showed that the multiquark pseudo - potentials obey the @xmath13-law , and that the spatial string tension is universal @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize that in these studies we do nt need additional parameters than those used for computing the quark - antiquark and multiquark potentials in @xcite .",
    "recently , we have proposed a construction of some hybrid potentials that perfectly reproduces the hybrid potential @xmath14 of @xcite . here",
    "the key role is played by a new object called `` defect '' that is nothing but a macroscopic description of some gluonic degrees of freedom in strong coupling @xcite .",
    "this provides a strong motivation for extending this construction to the hybrid pseudo - potentials . in doing so , we present here an example of the hybrid pseudo - potential @xmath14 . at zero temperature",
    "it reduces to the corresponding hybrid potential of @xcite , as it should be . to our knowledge , this is the first example of a computation of a hybrid pseudo - potential in the literature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the five(ten)-dimensional effective string theory .",
    "we begin by summarizing the theoretical background and the results of @xcite for the pseudo - potential .",
    "then , we introduce a point - like defect to macroscopically describe the @xmath15 hybrid pseudo - potentials .",
    "we go on in sec.iii to discuss the implications for a pure @xmath9 gauge theory .",
    "we conclude in sec.iv with a brief discussion of possibilities for further study .",
    "first , let us set the basic framework .",
    "the background metric in question is a one - parameter deformation of the schwarzschild black hole in @xmath16 space @xcite    @xmath17    where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is a radius of ads space , and @xmath20 is a deformation parameter .",
    "@xmath21 is related to the hawking temperature of the black hole , whose dual description is nothing but the temperature of gauge theory , as follows @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , we take a constant dilaton and discard other background fields .    as a prelude to discussing the hybrid pseudo - potentials ,",
    "let us briefly consider the pseudo - potential . as noted above , it is determined from the expectation value of a spatial wilson loop . on the string theory side , we calculate expectation values of spatial wilson loops by adopting the proposal of @xcite    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is an area of a string worldsheet bounded by a curve @xmath25 at the boundary of ads space . for the background geometry ,",
    "the pseudo - potential @xmath26 extracted from a rectangular loop of size @xmath1 is written in parametric form as @xcite    @xmath27    @xmath28 + c \\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 is a parameter , @xmath30 is a normalization constant , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 takes values in the interval @xmath33 $ ] if @xmath34 and @xmath35 $ ] if @xmath36 .    at long distances",
    "the pseudo - potential is linear at any finite temperature    @xmath37    with @xmath38 a spatial string tension . at this stage , we set @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "note that @xmath41 is the physical string tension at zero temperature and @xmath42 .",
    "obviously , there exists a critical value of @xmath43 , such that the spatial string tension is temperature independent below @xmath44 and rises rapidly above . on the lattice such",
    "a pattern was found in @xcite .",
    "for @xmath11 , the result is remarkably consistent with the available lattice data for @xmath8 and @xmath9 gauge theories @xcite .",
    "note that at higher temperatures the temperature dependence of @xmath7 is determined by the @xmath45-function of a gauge theory @xcite .",
    "certainly , the model does not incorporate the running coupling that makes it fail in this temperature range .    at short distances",
    "the pseudo - potential is a power function of @xmath46 for any temperature    @xmath47    where @xmath48 .",
    "this is another indication that the model is not perfect . on dimensional grounds ,",
    "one expects that @xmath4 is a logarithmic function of @xmath46 at very high temperatures .",
    "it is well known that the quark - antiquark potential corresponds to the ground state of a single string stretched between two fermionic sources .",
    "the common wisdom is that excited strings ( fluxes ) lead to hybrid potentials . on the lattice",
    "the corresponding operators are defined as linear combinations of the path - ordered exponentials of the gauge field @xcite .",
    "the generalized wilson loops are then constructed by parallel transporting these operators along the @xmath49-axis .",
    "however , making a transformation along a spatial direction introduces new objects .",
    "it is natural to call such objects generalized spatial wilson loops .",
    "hybrid pseudo - potentials are then extracted from the generalized spatial wilson loops in the same way as the hybrid potentials are extracted from the generalized wilson loops .",
    "it is clear from the construction that the hybrid pseudo - potentials may be labeled by the same set of quantum numbers .",
    "it also follows that given a string configuration for a hybrid potential , we can use it to construct the corresponding hybrid pseudo - potential , and vice versa .",
    "recently , a string configuration for the @xmath15 hybrid potentials has been proposed in @xcite . according to this proposal ,",
    "some string excitations can be modeled by inserting local objects on a string .",
    "these objects are called defects .",
    "the reason for this is that in the presence of defects string embeddings of worldsheets into spacetime are not differentiable at points where defects are located .",
    "we will now attempt to use the configuration of @xcite for finding the corresponding hybrid pseudo - potentials . in the case of a single defect , we consider the configuration shown in fig.1 .",
    "we place the quark - antiquark pair at the boundary points of the five(ten)-dimensional space such that each fermionic source is the endpoint of a fundamental string .",
    "the strings join at the defect in the interior .     and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the defect is placed at @xmath51.,width=217 ]    thus , the action has in addition to the standard nambu - goto actions , also a contribution arising from the defect .",
    "it is given by    @xmath52    where @xmath53 denotes the action of the string connecting the @xmath54-source with the defect .",
    "on the string theory side , a natural proposal for the expectation value of the generalized spatial wilson loop is    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is an area of two string worldsheets bounded by a loop @xmath25 at the boundary of ads space and glued along a line in the bulk . in the large @xmath13 limit @xmath57",
    "such that a dominant contribution comes from a lateral surface whose area is proportional to @xmath13 , while two end - surfaces only provide small corrections .",
    "since we are interested in a static configuration , for the strings we take    @xmath58    here @xmath59 are worldsheet coordinates .",
    "the nambu - goto action of the @xmath54-string is then    @xmath60    where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath61 .",
    "the action for the defect is taken to be of the form    @xmath62    where @xmath63 can be considered as its effective potential .",
    "unfortunately , the explicit form of @xmath63 is not determined only from the 5-dimensional metric .",
    "it requires the knowledge of the string theory dual to qcd .",
    "we will return to this issue in the next sections .",
    "the boundary conditions on the fields are given by    @xmath64    these determine the coefficients @xmath65 and @xmath66 in .",
    "thus , we have    @xmath67    now , we extremize the total action @xmath24 with respect to the worldsheet fields @xmath68 and @xmath69 describing the strings as well as with respect to @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 describing the location of the defect , with the following identifications : @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in doing so , we use the fact that there are two symmetries which simplify the further analysis .    since the integrand in does not depend explicitly on @xmath61",
    ", we get the first integral of euler - lagrange equations    @xmath75    in addition , because of translational invariance along the @xmath76-direction , there is another first integral .",
    "combining it with gives    @xmath77    together with the boundary conditions these equations determine the @xmath78 s    @xmath79    next , we extremize the action with respect to the location of the defect . after using and , we get    @xmath80    where @xmath81 . from this",
    "it follows that @xmath82 . as a result ,",
    "the static configuration lies entirely in the @xmath83-plane .",
    "now we introduce @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "this allows us to rewrite the first equation of as    @xmath86    where @xmath81 .",
    "obviously , it yields the unique solution @xmath87 . combining this with",

    ", we end up with the most symmetric configuration .",
    "now , we will compute the energy of the configuration .",
    "first , we reduce the integrals over @xmath61 in eq . to that over @xmath96 .",
    "this is easily done by using the first integral .",
    "since the integral is divergent at @xmath97 , we regularize it by imposing a cutoff @xmath98 . in @xcite . ]",
    "finally , the regularized expression takes the form    @xmath99    its @xmath98-expansion is    @xmath100    subtracting the @xmath101 term ( quark masses ) and letting @xmath102 , we get a finite result    @xmath103 + c \\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 is the same normalization constant as in .",

    "this yields @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 . with these parameters fixed ,",
    "the only parameter which remains to be determined for the @xmath14 hybrid pseudo - potential is @xmath114 .",

    "it follows immediately from the construction of @xmath109 that this reflects a general behavior pattern at finite temperature .",
    "moreover , the long distance behavior of the pseudo - potentials is always linear with the same spatial string tension .",
    "we take this as an indication that all generalized spatial wilson loops obey the area law behavior at any finite temperature and the spatial string tension is universal .",
    "it is noteworthy that in the case of the hybrid potentials model b turned out to be superior to model a as compared with the lattice data @xcite .",
    "therefore , we expect that this will be the case for the hybrid pseudo - potentials as well .",
    "one of the interesting conclusions of our construction is that at large distances the @xmath172 and @xmath14 pseudo - potentials are separated by a finite gap @xmath164 . at zero temperature",

    "obviously , the gap does nt show any significant temperature dependence at low temperatures . for model",
    "a it is a constant function , while for model b it is a slowly varying function of the temperature .",
    "the gap begins to grow when approaching the critical temperature .. ] note that in the temperature interval shown in fig.3 the growth is not exactly linear .",
    "although our construction may be inappropriate at short distances , it is , however , worth seeing how everything looks and works .    in both models the hybrid pseudo - potential after extrapolation to small @xmath46 behaves as    @xmath181    with @xmath182 given by , and @xmath140 given by .",
    "at zero temperature it coincides with that of the hybrid potential @xcite .",
    "the constant term @xmath182 is scheme dependent .",
    "it includes the common renormalization constant @xmath30 , such that in the @xmath172 pseudo - potential . on the other hand ,",
    "the value of @xmath140 is scheme independent .",

    "the functions begin to rise .",
    "we conclude our discussion of @xmath182 and @xmath140 by making a few remarks .",
    "first , @xmath182 is an increasing function of @xmath114 . for @xmath114 of order @xmath115 ,",
    "model a yields larger values of @xmath182 than model b. this is illustrated in fig.4 on the left and also seen from fig.2 .",
    "as the value of @xmath114 in model b is set to @xmath183 , the situation changes , as seen from fig.4 on the left . in particular",
    ", this explains the relative positions of the curves in fig.2 and fig.3 .",
    "second , for @xmath184 the curves for @xmath140 are fitted to the parametrization @xmath185 . finally , in the case of model b the function @xmath186 has a shallow minimum at @xmath187 .",
    "\\(i ) in this work , we have restricted ourselves to the @xmath172 and @xmath14 pseudo - potentials . the reason for doing this is that for @xmath46 below about @xmath188 fm the lattice data for other hybrid potentials @xcite are well described by neither model a nor model b @xcite .",
    "one might expect that the same thing also happens for the corresponding pseudo - potentials .",
    "it will be interesting , nevertheless , to see what actually happens . to our knowledge",
    ", there have been no studies of the hybrid pseudo - potentials on the lattice yet .",
    "the model we are pursuing predicts that the spatial string tension in units of the physical tension is universal in the sense that it depends only on the ratio @xmath178 ( see eq . ) .",
    "this is supported by lattice simulations for @xmath189 @xcite . however , there are no lattice data for larger @xmath190 , and so new simulations would be welcome .",
    "the same is also applicable to the hybrid potentials whose @xmath190-dependence is not yet known .",
    "second , in model a the cusp angle vanishes in the limit @xmath197 .",
    "this is true for all values of @xmath43 . on the other hand , in model",
    "b the cusp angle is non - zero for @xmath166 , while it is zero for @xmath198 .",
    "thus , large strings are smoothed out in the deconfining phase .      finally , let us note that cusps occur in the five(ten)-dimensional framework , where the derivative @xmath199 turns out to be discontinuous .",
    "the question naturally arises : what happens in four dimensions ?",
    "in other words , whether a qcd string is smooth or not .",
