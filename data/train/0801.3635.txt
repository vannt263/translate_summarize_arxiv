    "the discovery of the x(2175 ) @xmath9 resonance in @xmath10 with initial state radiation at babar @xcite , also confirmed at bes in @xmath11 @xcite , has stimulated research around its nontrivial nature in terms of quark components .",
    "the possibility of it being a tetraquark @xmath12 is investigated within qcd sum rules in @xcite , and as a gluon hybrid @xmath13 state has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "a recent review on this issue can be seen in @xcite , where the basic problem of the expected large decay widths into two mesons of the states of these models , contrary to what is experimentally observed , is discussed .",
    "the basic data on this resonance from @xcite are @xmath14 mev and @xmath15 mev , which are consistent with the numbers quoted from bes @xmath16 mev and @xmath17 mev . in ref .",
    "@xcite an indication of this resonance is seen as an increase of the @xmath18 cross section around @xmath19 mev .",
    "a detailed theoretical study of the @xmath10 reaction was done in ref .",
    "@xcite by means of loop diagrams involving kaons and @xmath20 , using chiral amplitudes for the @xmath21 channel which contains the @xmath2 pole generated dynamically by the theory .",
    "the study revealed that the loop mechanisms reproduced the background but failed to produce the peak around @xmath22 mev , thus reinforcing the claims for a new resonance around this mass .    in the present paper",
    ", we advocate a very different picture for the x(2175 ) resonance which allows for a reliable calculation and leads naturally to a very narrow width and no coupling to two pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the picture is that the x(2175 ) is an ordinary resonant state of @xmath3 due to the interaction of these components .",
    "the @xmath2 resonance is dynamically generated from the interaction of @xmath5 and @xmath1 treated as coupled channels within the chiral unitary approach of @xcite , qualifying as a kind of molecule with @xmath5 and @xmath1 as its components , with a large coupling to @xmath1 and a weaker one to @xmath5 [ hence , the small width compared to that of the @xmath23 .",
    "similar studies for the vector - pseudoscalar interaction have also been carried out using chiral dynamics in @xcite , which lead to the dynamical generation of the low - lying axial vectors .",
    "we shall follow the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite to deal with this part of the problem and will use the @xmath24 and @xmath25 amplitudes obtained in that approach .    to study the @xmath3 interaction ,",
    "we are thus forced to investigate the three - body system @xmath0 considering the interaction of the three components among themselves and keeping in mind the expected strong correlations of the @xmath26 system to make the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "for this purpose we have solved the faddeev equations with coupled channels @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the picture is later complemented with the addition of the @xmath4 state as a coupled channel .",
    "the study benefits from previous ones on the @xmath29 and @xmath30 along with their coupled channels done in @xcite , where many @xmath31 , strange , and nonstrange low - lying baryon resonances of the particle data group @xcite were reproduced .",
    "this success encourages us to extend the model of refs .",
    "@xcite to study the three - meson system , i.e. , @xmath32 .",
    "one of the interesting findings of refs .",
    "@xcite was a cancellation of the off - shell part of the amplitudes with the genuine three - body forces that one obtains from the same chiral lagrangians .",
    "this simplified technically the approach , and we shall stick to this formalism also here .",
    "to study the @xmath0 system , it is required to solve the faddeev equations .",
    "the procedure followed is ( 1 ) we solve coupled - channel bethe - salpeter equations for pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar meson ( pp ) interaction as done in @xcite ; and for pseudoscalar - vector mesons ( pv ) interaction as in @xcite ; ( 2 ) then we solve the faddeev equations for the three - body , i.e. , vector - pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar ( vpp ) mesons , system using the model developed in @xcite .",
    "we describe the input and the formalism for this latter part briefly in this section .",
    "we calculate the three - body @xmath33 matrix as obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite in terms of @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath35 where @xmath36 \\,\\,{\\rm",

    "depend on the total energy in the center of mass of the interacting pair .",
    "the @xmath42 can be related to the faddeev partitions , @xmath43 , as @xmath44 where @xmath43 sums all of the diagrams with the particle @xmath45 as a spectator in the last interaction and @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) is the initial ( final ) momentum of the @xmath45th particle in the global center of mass .",

    "the model in ref .",
    "@xcite has been built by writing the terms including more than two @xmath37-matrices by replacing the `` @xmath48 '' propagator by a function @xmath54 , thus leading to eq .",
    "( [ trest ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the invariant mass of the @xmath60 pair , and @xmath61 is defined as @xmath62^{-1}.\\nonumber\\ ] ] this @xmath54 is a loop function of a propagator , in the three - body scattering diagrams , in which the dependence on the loop variable of an anterior @xmath37 matrix and propagator has been included in the form of an off - shell factor @xmath63 .",
    "this simplifies technically solving eq .",
    "( [ fullt ] ) and induces regrouping of the three - body diagrams giving six faddeev partitions [ eq . ( [ trest ] ) ] instead of three ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion )",
    ".    we label @xmath64 as particle @xmath65 and @xmath66 and @xmath67 as particle @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "the invariant mass of the @xmath1 system @xmath70 is taken as an input to the three - body calculations and is varied around the mass of the @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath71 interaction @xmath72 in this region contains the pole of the @xmath6(980 ) @xcite .",
    "the other invariant masses @xmath73 and @xmath74 can be then calculated in terms of the @xmath70 and total energy @xcite .",
    "thus , there are two variables of the calculations , i.e. , the total energy and the invariant mass of the @xmath1 system",
    ".    we shall now discuss the input , i.e. , the two - body @xmath37 matrices for the pp and pv mesons interaction .",
    "for the pp case , the bethe - salpeter equation @xmath75 has been solved for five coupled channels , i.e. , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 . the potentials @xmath81 are calculated from the lowest order chiral lagrangian and the loops @xmath82 have been calculated using dimensional regularization as in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite found poles in the @xmath37 matrices , in the isospin 0 sector , corresponding to the @xmath83 and the @xmath6 resonances , and also the one corresponding to the @xmath84(980 ) for the isospin 1 case .",
    "it was also found that the @xmath6 resonance is dominated by the @xmath1 channel and the pole for the @xmath6 appears at @xmath85 973 mev even when the @xmath5 channel is eliminated .",
    "the matrix element corresponding to the @xmath86 scattering is used as an input , @xmath72 , to solve eqs.([trest ] ) and ( [ fullt ] ) . in the two - body problem",
    ", the @xmath6(980 ) pole appears below the @xmath71 threshold .",
    "it corresponds to total energies of the @xmath1 system below @xmath87 and in the momentum representation to purely imaginary kaon momenta if we take @xmath88 ( which is not the case in a bound state ) . to avoid using unphysical complex momenta in the three - body system",
    ", we give a minimum value of about 50 mev / c to the kaon momentum in the @xmath1 center of mass system .",
    "it should be mentioned that the results are almost insensitive to this choice of the minimum momentum .",
    "for example , a change in this momentum by about 40@xmath89 changes the position of the peak merely by @xmath85 5 mev .    for the vp meson interaction , eq .",
    "( [ bs ] ) is calculated with @xmath24 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 as coupled channels .",
    "the potential for the vp meson - meson interaction has been obtained from the lowest order chiral lagrangian and projected in the s wave @xcite , and then the @xmath94 element of the resulting coupled - channel @xmath37 matrix is used as an input in eq .",
    "( [ trest ] )    coming back to the three - body problem , we take the @xmath95 @xmath37-matrix element as @xmath96 to solve eqs.([trest ] ) and ( [ fullt ] ) .",
    "our interest is to check the possibility of existence of a resonance or a bound state with isospin zero in the @xmath0 system ; thus the full @xmath34 matrix [ eq .",
    "( [ fullt ] ) ] is to be projected to total isospin 0 .",
    "when adding the @xmath4 channel , we must deal with the @xmath5 and @xmath25 interactions which are part of the coupled - channel study of the scalar and axial vector resonances , respectively .",
    "in the construction of the @xmath71 and @xmath24 two - body @xmath37 matrices we have used the full space of coupled channels as indicated in sec .",
    "we shall argue here that in the three - body basis we can omit some states .",
    "the @xmath24 system couples to @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath93 , and @xmath92 .",
    "we shall bear in mind that we are looking for a state with @xmath97 = 0 and with @xmath98 980 mev , as found in the experiment @xcite .",
    "when adding the @xmath67 of the three - body @xmath0 system to the coupled channels of the @xmath24 , we obtain the following states : @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 . if we want the subsystem of two pseudoscalar mesons to build up the @xmath6 ( 980 ) , which is dynamically generated in the @xmath1 and @xmath5 interaction , we must exclude the @xmath101 and @xmath102 states . the @xmath100 state is also excluded because when @xmath1 couples to the @xmath6 ( 980 ) the total isospin of the state is @xmath97 = 1 . only the @xmath103 state is left over .",
    "we could add this channel to the @xmath0 , but the @xmath103 channel lies @xmath85 400 mev below the @xmath104 ( 2175 ) resonance mass and hence is not expected to have much influence in that region . in more technical words , a channel which lies far away from the energy region under investigation would only bring a small and smooth energy - independent contribution to the final amplitude because of the large off - shellness of the propagators .",
    "thus the introduction of the @xmath99 channel can only influence mildly the results obtained with the @xmath0 system alone , and thus we neglect it in the study .",
    "furthermore we have also seen that the @xmath105 and @xmath106 amplitudes are weaker than the @xmath107 one .    even though we argue above that @xmath108 and @xmath109 channels",
    "should be neglected , we have also investigated the effect of including the @xmath108 channel , as an example .",
    "this is a channel where the @xmath110 interaction ( together with the @xmath111 channel ) leads to the scalar @xmath112 resonance , and actually there are works which hint towards a possibility of @xmath113 forming a molecule with mass around 1576 mev @xcite .",
    "what we find can be summarized as follows :    * in the energy region of our interest , we find a small transition amplitude from @xmath114 as compared to @xmath115 , indicating a small mixture of the @xmath32 , and @xmath108 components .",
    "* studying the @xmath108 system alone , we find that the corresponding amplitudes are much smaller in size than those found in the @xmath32 system in the energy region around 2150 mev . * in the region of energies around 1600 mev , the @xmath108 amplitudes can be bigger than around 2150 mev , but they are still smaller than the @xmath32 amplitude at 2150 mev .    from these findings we conclude that , although more detailed work needs to be done at energies around 1600 mev to check the suggestion of @xcite , the amplitude of the @xmath108 channel in this energy region seems too weak to support bound states . on the other hand , we can be more assertive by stating that the effect of the @xmath108 channel around 2150 mev is negligible",
    ".    we can now stick to having the @xmath64 as the vector meson and @xmath1 as the main meson - meson channel .",
    "yet , @xmath1 and @xmath5 are strongly coupled in @xmath97=0 , both the @xmath86 and @xmath116 amplitudes are strong , and it is only the intricate nonlinear dynamics of coupled channels of the bethe - salpeter equations that produces at the end two states , the @xmath83 that couples strongly to the @xmath5 channel and the @xmath6 ( 980 ) that couple strongly to @xmath1 .",
    "hence , we find advisable to include @xmath117 as a coupled channel .",
    "in fig . [ ampsq ] , we show the squared amplitude @xmath118 and its projection , as a function of the total energy ( @xmath50 ) and the invariant mass of the @xmath71 system ( @xmath70 ) , in the isospin zero configuration . we have made the isospin projection of the amplitude of eq .",

    "the peak in @xmath121 appears for the @xmath70 @xmath85 970 mev which is very close to the pole of the @xmath6 resonance @xcite .",
    "squared amplitude in the isospin 0 configuration . ]",
    "the total mass , the invariant mass of the @xmath1 subsystem and the quantum numbers @xmath123 of the resonance found here are all in agreement with those found experimentally for the x(2175 ) @xcite .",
    "these findings strongly suggest that this resonance can be identified with the @xmath124 .    yet , our approach can go further and we can make an evaluation of the production cross section and compare it with the experimental results of @xcite . for this",
    "we make use of the theoretical evaluation of the @xmath125 production in the @xmath126 reaction studied in @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite studied the production of the @xmath64 and @xmath127 as plane waves ( @xmath128 ) in the final state and could reproduce the background but not the peak structure around @xmath124 mass .",
    "since our resonance develops from the interaction of the @xmath64 and @xmath6 , the consideration of the final state interaction ( @xmath129 ) , in addition to the uncorrelated @xmath130 production amplitude ( @xmath131 ) of @xcite , could explain the experimental data in the peak region .",
    "we show here that this is indeed the case .",
    "we implement the @xmath130 @xmath129 by multiplying @xmath131 by the factor @xcite @xmath132,\\label{fsi}\\ ] ] where @xmath133 is the scattering matrix for @xmath64 and @xmath6 and @xmath134 is the loop function of the @xmath64 and @xmath6 propagators .",
    "for @xmath135 we use the standard formula for two mesons @xcite with a cut - off ( @xmath136 ) of the order of the sum of the two meson masses , as was the case in @xcite , and hence @xmath137 gev here .",
    "we do not have the @xmath133 , but in the vicinity of the resonance it must be proportional to the three - body @xmath34 [ eq .",
    "( [ fullt ] ) ] , implying @xmath138 .",
    "the proportionality coefficient @xmath139 is readily obtained using a relation based on unitarity , @xmath140 , implicit in eq .",

    "the dashed - dotted line shows the result of the calculation of the cross section in the plane wave approximation @xcite .",
    "the dashed ( solid ) line shows the result of multiplying the amplitude from ref .",
    "@xcite by the final state interaction factor [ eq .",
    "( [ fsi ] ) ] calculated using a cutoff of 2 ( 2.5 ) gev for the @xmath144 .",
    "the data , which corresponds to the @xmath145 reaction ( triangles for charged pions and boxes for neutral pions ) , have been taken from @xcite . ]    with this information we evaluate the @xmath146 production cross section taking the results for the @xmath130 production in the plane wave approximation from @xcite , and we show the results in fig.[crosn ] .",
    "we can see that taking a cut - off of the order of 2 - 2.5 gev for the @xmath135 , we obtain results for the production cross section which are in fair agreement with the experimental ones . in order to compare the results with the experimental cross sections in the x ( 2175 ) mass region , the energy argument of the amplitude @xmath34",
    "has been shifted by @xmath147 mev .",
    "note , however , that the difference of @xmath148 mev in the energy position ( 1 @xmath89 of the mass ) represents a remarkable agreement for a hadronic model of meson spectra .",
    "we would like now to comment on the effects of including the @xmath117 channel , as discussed in sec .",
    "we observe a similar peak as in fig .",
    "[ ampsq ] ( see fig . [ ampsqpi ] ) ; however , the position of the peak in the total energy has been displaced by about 38 mev downwards to an energy of 2112 mev . at the same time",
    ", the peak shows up around @xmath98 965 mev , about 15 mev below the nominal energy of the @xmath6 ( 980 ) .",
    "these differences with the nominal values of the masses of the resonances are typical of any hadronic model of resonances and , thus , the association of the resonance found to the @xmath104 ( 2175 ) , which has the same quantum numbers as the resonance found , is the most reasonable conclusion .     channel . ]    in any case , the different options taken along the work , have always led to a clean peak around the same position , and the difference found could give us an idea of the theoretical uncertainties .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that the @xmath34 matrix for the isospin = 1 does not show any structure .",
    "we have checked the sensitivity of the resonance found to the change in the cut - off ( @xmath149 1000 mev ) used in the calculation of the input two - body @xmath37 matrices [ eq .",
    "( [ bs ] ) ] , which gives the same results as dimensional regularization .",
    "there is not much freedom to change the @xmath136 in this case , because it has been constrained by reproducing the data on the respective two - body scattering .",
    "we thus change @xmath136 by @xmath85 20 mev for calculating eq .",
    "( [ bs ] ) , which still guarantees a reasonable agreement with the two - body cross sections , and find that it gives rise to a change in the peak position ( in fig.[ampsq ] ) in @xmath50 by @xmath85 8 mev .",
    "the cutoff is also needed to evaluate the @xmath150 functions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) , and we use the same cut - off of about 1 gev .",
    "since this function involves loops with three - meson propagators , it is very insensitive to the cutoff .",
    "the same change of @xmath151 mev ( or more ) in @xmath136 leads to negligible changes in the results in this case .",
    "our approach makes explicit use of the cancellation of the off - shell parts of the two - body @xmath37 matrices in the three - body diagrams with the genuine three - body forces , which arise from the same chiral lagrangians .",
    "the off - shell part of a scattering matrix is unphysical and can be changed arbitrarily by performing a unitary transformation of the fields .    inside the loops , the off - shell part of the chiral amplitudes , which behaves as @xmath152 ( where @xmath153 is the four vector of the off - shell particle ) for each of the meson legs , cancels a propagator leading to a diagram with the topology of a three - body force @xcite .",
    "it is also a peculiar feature of the chiral lagrangians that there is a cancellation of these three - body forces with those arising from the @xmath154 contact terms of the theory .",
    "examples of similar cancellations are well known in chiral theories @xcite .",
    "the detailed derivation of the cancellation of the off - shell part of the @xmath37 matrices and the three - body force arising from the chiral lagrangian can be seen in the appendix @xcite for the @xmath30 interaction . in the present case ,",
    "the cancellation also occurs , but it is slightly different technically .",
    "in fact , its derivation is easier than in the case studied in @xcite , and we discuss it in the appendix for a case in which the leading order contribution to the @xmath155 transition is not null . however , in the @xmath156 case , the potential is zero . in this case , the @xmath37 matrix is generated by rescattering through @xmath157 and @xmath158 states , and the cancellation is found in the transition potentials .",
    "we find also instructive to see what one gets if the off - shell part of the two - body @xmath37matrices is retained .",
    "following refs .",
    "@xcite we find , for the s wave , @xmath159    the @xmath160 terms in eq .",
    "( [ voff ] ) are ineffective in the loops of the two - body @xmath37 matrix [ eq .",
    "( [ bs ] ) ] @xcite but will show up in the external legs of the two - body @xmath37 matrix used as an input in the faddeev equations .",
    "hence @xmath161 where @xmath162 denotes the corresponding on - shell @xmath37-matrix .",
    "if we use these amplitudes , instead of the on - shell ones we find a very similar result to that depicted in fig.[ampsq ] , with the amplitude peaking at @xmath163 mev and @xmath164 mev .",
    "thus , the @xmath71 still appears very correlated around the @xmath127 , but the total energy has been shifted by 40 mev .",
    "this is the result we obtain by using the off - shell @xmath37 matrices and neglecting the effect of the @xmath154 contact term of the theory , which as mentioned above cancels the effect of the off - shell part of the @xmath37 matrix . in other words",
    ", we could say that the three - body forces of the chiral lagrangian are responsible for a shift of the resonance mass from @xmath165 to @xmath85 @xmath19 mev , thus leading to a better agreement with the mass of the @xmath124 , but , of course , the result holds for the particular choice of fields of the ordinary chiral lagrangians .",
    "one might want to see if a peak obtained in the three - body @xmath33 matrix corresponds to a pole in the complex plane .",
    "the peak is so clean and close to a breit - wigner for a fixed @xmath70 that it can only be reflected by a pole in the complex plane . yet",
    ", we have looked at it in more detail through in a simplified way .",
    "we keep the variable @xmath70 as real , and we fix its value to the one where the peak appears and then study the @xmath0 amplitude as a function of the complex @xmath50 variable",

    "( [ unitarity ] ) , since @xmath139 is real @xmath176 which leads to @xmath177 which upon taking into account that @xmath178 with @xmath143 being real , results in @xmath179.\\ ] ] then @xmath180 has a pole at @xmath181 which appears indeed very close to @xmath182 and @xmath183 as we have checked numerically , taking @xmath184 and @xmath185 from the shape of @xmath34 .",
    "we also get the complex conjugate pole taking another branch of the logarithm .",
    "in summary , the interaction of the @xmath0 system studied with the faddeev equations leads to a rearrangement of the @xmath1 subsystem as the @xmath6(980)(@xmath186 ) resonance .",
    "then , the @xmath6(980 ) together with the @xmath64 forms a narrow resonant @xmath9 state with a mass bigger than @xmath187 , which decays into @xmath130(980 ) and hence is most naturally associated to the recently discovered @xmath104(2175 ) resonance",
    ". the narrow width of around 27 mev obtained here is compatible within errors with the experimental width @xmath188 mev .",
    "we have also included @xmath4 as a coupled channel of @xmath0 and find a peak very similar to the one found with the @xmath0 channel alone , except that the peak is displaced by 38 mev down to smaller masses .",
    "we also noted that the theoretical uncertainties are of this order of magnitude .",
    "the typical differences of our results with the experimental ones are in the range of 50 mev for the mass and the width are roughly compatible .",
    "these are typical differences found in successful models of hadron spectroscopy .",
    "the theory also shows that there is no resonance in @xmath189(980 ) .",
    "although a complete study of this state would require the addition of the @xmath190 channel , we found that the strength of the @xmath32 amplitude in @xmath191 is much smaller in magnitude than that of the @xmath32 in @xmath192 , far away from developing a pole upon reasonable changes of the input variables .",

    "the cancellations in this case have to be seen in the terms involving the transition to these intermediate states of the coupled channels .",
    "this can be done in the same way as it will be shown below , but for the sake of clarity we have taken a simple case to show the cancellation between the contribution of the off - shell part of the @xmath37 matrices and the contact term vector - pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar of the corresponding chiral lagrangian .",
