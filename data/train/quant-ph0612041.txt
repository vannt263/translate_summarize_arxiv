    "in this paper , we study the quantum dynamics of two interacting oscillator systems in two different , but very well - known scenarios . in case one ,",
    "both oscillators are assumed to be linear , and in case two , one oscillator is assumed to be linear , while the other oscillator is assumed to be non - linear ( angular momentum oscillator ) .",
    "we study heisenberg equations and the time evolution of the wave - functions @xmath0 for both cases to discuss the quantum interactive behaviors between the two oscillators therein , e.g. , entanglement , spontaneous emission ( in case two ) , and quantum versus classical differences ( in case two ) .",
    "entanglement , an implicit non - classical ingredient of interacting quantum systems , is the key to enabling quantum computation , which allows for the solution of certain classes of problems more efficiently than the classical counterpart ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) . for case two , by setting the relevant commutator relation in each oscillator to one or zero , we utilize an interesting quantum - classical scheme @xcite to clearly characterize the quantum features in the system .",
    "in order to investigate the time evolution of the wave - function and the notion of entanglement in case one , we adopt the coupled - boson representation,@xcite which was discussed by schwinger in terms of the correspondence between two one - dimensional linear oscillators and an angular momentum oscillator . based on this representation , we will easily obtain exact energy eigenvalues and eigenstates of case one .",
    "the coupled - boson representation has been used in context with similar types of problems to construct an ideal model for quantum - mechanical interference@xcite and to study the current operator in two coupled linear oscillator ( the rate of exchange of occupation number between oscillators).@xcite    we adopt here @xmath1 as an entanglement measure for the total system in a pure state,@xcite where @xmath2 is a reduced density matrix of individual oscillator @xmath3 .",
    "we will show that this measure increases with the occupation number @xmath4 for a given initial state for case one , and with the maximum quantum number @xmath5 of the angular momentum oscillator for case two , respectively ; this increase with occupation number results from considering a dissipationless and coherent process , whereas we know that entanglement will diminish when loss is taken into account , e.g. , resulting from the ( thermal ) interaction between the system and its environment.@xcite for case two , we will discuss entanglement for the cases where the angular momentum oscillator is in the states @xmath6 explicitly .    in section [ sec : linear_linear_osc ] , we study the interaction between two linear oscillators .",
    "the heisenberg equations of motion are analyzed in the coupled boson representation , leading to the straightforward diagonalization of the coupled oscillator hamiltonian ; from this diagonalized hamiltonian , the exact eigenstates and eigenvalues of the coupled oscillator hamiltonian are obtained , thus allowing for the calculation of the reduced density matrix , and the subsequent study of the entanglement under the two initial conditions of simple product state ( a disentangled state ) and exact eigenstate for the coupled oscillator system ( an entangled state ) .    in section [ sec : linear_non_linear ] , we study the interaction between a linear and a non - linear , angular momentum oscillator . we make use of the seminal work of ref . to analyze the quantum - mechanical and the classical dynamics of this interaction , and to connect the quantum manifestation of spontaneous emission in this system with the notion of entanglement .",
    "further , the total system hamiltonian is diagonalized for @xmath7 using rotational generating operators of the group @xmath8.@xcite from this diagonalization , the reduced density matrix , and thus the measure of entanglement , is calculated for simple product ( disentangled ) initial states .",
    "unlike the linear - linear oscillator system , this coupled system displays periodicity in the measure of entanglement for @xmath9 and @xmath10 , whereas for @xmath11 and beyond , the measure of entanglement is aperiodic ; this aperiodicity is shown to be a result of the complex structure of the diagonalized multi - level hamiltonian .",
