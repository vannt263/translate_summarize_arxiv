    "supernova ( sn ) ejecta can enrich a galaxy s interstellar medium with nucleosynthesis products generated during the progenitor s main sequence lifetime , post - main sequence evolution , and the explosive burning that occurs during the supernova outburst itself . in this way , sne influence a galaxy s chemistry by steadily increasing the metallicity of subsequent stellar populations ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "expanding shells of stellar debris can undergo instabilities leading to the formation of ejecta clumps @xcite . indeed , there is considerable observational evidence for ejecta clumping especially in core - collapse sne ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    unfortunately , there are few direct observational constraints regarding the timescales for the fragmentation and dissolution of ejecta clumps as they move through and merge with the progenitor s circumstellar medium ( csm ) and local interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "in contrast to this scarcity of direct observations , the interaction of sn ejecta fragments with local csm and ism in supernova remnants ( snr ) has been the subject of many theoretical studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "several related studies have also discussed the properties of the interstellar `` bullets '' seen in herbig - haro ( hh ) objects and planetary nebulae @xcite and there are numerous investigations addressing the general case of a shock wave interacting with interstellar clouds ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "young and relatively nearby galactic snrs offer the possibility of relatively high resolution investigations of such sn ejecta ism / csm interactions . with the possible exception of the large ejecta clumps seen in the vela remnant @xcite , the galactic snr exhibiting",
    "the best example of sn ejecta clumps is the young core - collapse remnant cassiopeia a ( cas a ) . with a current estimated age of around 330 years",
    "@xcite cas a is believed to be the remains of a type iib supernova event probably from a red supergiant progenitor with an initial mass in the range of 1525 m@xmath3 which might have lost much its hydrogen envelope due to a binary interaction @xcite .",
    "cas a consists of an optical , infrared , and x - ray bright @xmath4 diameter ( @xmath54 pc at 3.4 kpc ; @xcite ) emission ring of reverse shock - heated sn debris rich in o , si , s , ar , ca and fe @xcite .",
    "the remnant s optically visible debris appears as condensations and filaments with typical scale lengths of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 cm )    early broadband photographic images of cas a taken over several decades starting in the 1950 s revealed substantial changes in the brightness and appearance of the remnant s bright main shell of reverse shocked ejecta @xcite .",
    "these changes have significantly altered the remnant s overall optical appearance from that seen in 1951 when the remnant was first optically imaged ( see @xcite ) .",

    ", no investigation has been made into possible optical flux changes in any of the many hundreds of small ejecta clumps or ` knots ' lying outside the remnant s main shell . with locations at or ahead of the remnant s forward shock front @xcite , they comprise the vanguard of remnant s sn ejecta and are thus the first to dissolve into and enrich the local ism .",
    "they are not visible due to reverse shock heating as in the main ejecta shell , but are instead shock - heated due to their high speed passage through the local circumstellar and interstellar medium .    here",
    "we report results of an imaging survey of some of these outlying debris knots which reveal significant brightness fluctuations over times scales as short as nine months .",
    "in addition , a small percentage of knots exhibit trailing emission suggestive of mass stripping and knot disruption due to their high - velocity interaction with local csm and ism .",
    "we also identify several tight clusters of ejecta knots with a morphology resembling recent model results for the fragmentation of much larger ejecta knots .",

    "broadband images of the cas  a remnant were obtained using two different cameras on board the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) . although the primary focus of these images was cas a s bright main emission shell of supernova debris ,",
    "some of these images cover parts of the remnant s outer periphery , thereby detecting dozens of high - speed outlying ejecta knots .",

    "the stsdas _ drizzle _ task was also used to combine single exposures in each filter .    for the wfpc2",
    "f675w images , fluxes for eastern limb knots were measured using the iraf tasks ` apphot ' . for the acs f625f , f775w , and",
    "f850lp images , calibrated estimates for fluxes of each outer optical ejecta knot for the three filters were taken from the outer ejecta knot catalog of @xcite which were calculated using the sextractor @xcite automated source extraction software package . for cases where the automated programs failed ,",
    "knot fluxes were calculated manually five pixel wide apertures .",
    "when fluxes were manually calculated , background estimation was performed by calculating the total @xmath112 pixel aperture flux in at least five positions near the object ( avoiding other sources ) and then subtracting the mean computed `` background '' flux from the total object pixel sum .",
    "final detector count numbers were then converted to flux by multiplying by the mean flux density per unit wavelength generating 1 count s@xmath9 ( i.e. , the ` photflam ' factor ) times the filter effective bandwidth ( ebw ) .    due to the non - spherical nature along with sometimes changing morphology of some ejecta knots , plus the closeness of adjacent emission knots , flux measurements for many of these outlying ejecta knots are subject to greater errors than simply photometric accuracy .",
    "moreover , differences between filter bandpass and system throughputs between the wfpc2 f675w filter and the combined acs f625w + f775w adds to the uncertainty when comparing january 2000 and january 2002 wfpc2 fluxes to march and december 2004 acs fluxes .",
    "nonetheless , since the wfpc2 f675w filter images and the acs f625w + f775w filter images cover the same ejecta emission lines , namely [ ] @xmath146300 , 6364 , h@xmath113 , [ ] @xmath146548 , 6583 , [ ] @xmath146716 , 6731 , and [ ] @xmath147319 , 7330 ( see @xcite for further details ) , we have attempted to investigate some knot flux changes over the nearly 5.5 yr interval ( june 1999 to december 2004 ) using these two _ hst _ image sets .    for our investigation of relative flux differences between different epochs using both wfpc2 and acs images ,",
    "detector counts were summed using @xmath114 to @xmath115 pixel sized windows depending on knot size and neighboring emission complexity , subtraction of a local mean background , and finally normalized to the measured flux of several neighboring field stars .",
    "flux errors listed in tables 1 and 2 include apphot measurement uncertainties , background non - uniformities , and measurement deviations observed when varying knot centroids . while most 1 @xmath116 uncertainties listed are below 10% , measured flux uncertainties can be as much as 30% for some knots .",
    "in general , we found that a significant fraction of ejecta knots around all portions of the outer periphery of cas a show some degree of optical flux variability .",
    "below , we discuss these flux changes along with morphological changes in some of these outer ejecta knots . due to differences in expansion velocities and possible chemical compositions",
    ", the following discussion is divided into sections by knot location .",
    "figure 1 shows _ hst _",
    "images for one of the streams of ejecta in the remnant s ne jet feature taken at three epochs covering a time span of nearly five years .",
    "the top panel is a june 1999 wfpc2 f675w image , the middle panel a january 2002 wfpc f675w image , with the bottom panel a march 2004 f625w + f775w acs image .",
    "all three images are sensitive essentially to the same set of emission lines ; namely , [ ] @xmath146300 , 6364 , [ ] @xmath147319 , 7330 , and [ ] @xmath146716 , 6731 .",
    "thus changes seen between these images should be representative of overall flux changes in a knot s line emission .",
    "as figure 1 illustrates , large brightness changes occur in many of the ne jet s ejecta knots across the whole length of this ejecta stream during this five year period .",
    "ejecta knots and knot complexes exhibiting especially large flux increases or decreases have been marked in the figure by circles and boxes , respectively . despite significant changes in many individual knots and knot clusters , the overall optical appearance of this stream of ejecta",
    "does not dramatically change over this nearly five year time period .",
    "significant flux changes for some ne jet knots can occur over much shorter timescales and we have investigated whether such changes are associated with varying elemental abundances or changes in the ionization state of the ejecta . to do this , we examined several ne jet ejecta knots using acs images taken nine months apart ( march and december 2004 ) using the f625w , f775w and f850lp filters .",
    "these filters are primarily sensitive to [ ] @xmath146716 , 6731 , [ ] @xmath147319 , 7330 and [ ] @xmath149069 , 9531 line emission , respectively .",
    "they thus serve as flux variability indicators sensitive to both knot chemistry and ionization state .",
    "+    +      the location of 15 selected knots in the remnant s ne jet which were found to exhibit large brightness changes over this nine month period are shown in figure 2 , both in relation to the whole remnant and within the ne jet region .",
    "enlargements of the march and december 2004 acs f625w + f775w images of these 15 knots are shown in figure 3 . to study possible abundance and ionization level changes , we measured f775w ( i.e. , [ ] ) and f850lp ( i.e. , [ ] ) fluxes for march and december 2004 for these knots are listed in table 1 .    knots that brightened optically over this period are @xmath117 and 8 , 9 , 12 , and 13 .",
    "conversely , knots 7 , 10 , 11 , 14 and 15 decreased in flux .",
    "overall , a majority of knot flux changes involved brightening , with only a small percentage of knots showing flux decreases over the march to december 2004 time period . while our investigation concentrated on significant knot flux changes , knots that brightened were found to increase in flux by larger factors ( @xmath118 ) as compared to that seen for knots that faded .",
    "although the five knots listed in table 1 which faded between march and december 2004 appear to fade by nearly the same factor of @xmath1192 suggesting similar decay light curves , examination of other jet knots indicate a wider range of flux decrease is possible . for example , the @xcite catalog knots 419 , 995 , and 1019 showed 2004 dec / mar f775w flux ratios of 0.35 , 0.25 and 0.35 , respectively .    in general , we detected no pattern in terms of brightness changes between the three filters to suggest systematic changes in the line emissions between knot brightening or fading .",
    "this can be seen in table 1 where we compare the measured f775w and f850lp fluxes which are primarily sensitive to [ ] and [ ] , respectively .",
    "( note : we excluded flux measurements in the f625w filter in table 1 since it is sensitive to both [ ] @xmath146300 , 6364 and [ ] @xmath146716 , 6731 , thus complicating interpretation of any observed flux changes . )    while large brightness changes were only seen in a minority of jet emission knots ( @xmath10525% ) , smaller flux changes were apparent in a much larger percentage of knots , approaching 50% when viewed over a longer time frame ( see fig .  1 )",
    "however , with few exceptions , faint emission was nearly always visible prior to or following even large brighten or fading episodes suggesting a minimum excitation level of the ejecta knot outside of these large flux change occurrences .",
    "substantial knot brightness changes were also seen in the remnant s high - velocity ejecta located along its eastern limb . unlike the ne jet knots , most ejecta here exhibit a spectrum dominated by h@xmath113 and [ ] emission lines , indicating a less o and s rich composition @xcite .",
    "the portion of the eastern limb region that was examined for flux changes is shown in the left panel of figure 4 .",
    "locations of selected ejecta knots showing large brightness changes are marked in the five smaller regions indicated in the right panel of figure 4 , with 2000 and 2002 wfpc2 and 2004 acs enlargements of these regions presented in figure 5 . within these smaller regions ,",
    "flux measurements were made of eight individual knots ( knots a - h ; see table 2 ) .",
    "a variety of light curves was found here , with some knots going up and down in brightness ( ` flickering ' ) in times as short as one year .",
    "for example , knot a brighten slightly between january 2000 and january 2002 but then sharply declined between march and december 2004 ( see fig .   5 , top row of images ) .",
    "knot b ( second row from top ) was undetected in the january 2000 wfpc2 image becoming visible in january 2002 but then faded again by december 2004 . whereas knot g ( bottom row ) underwent similar flux changes as knot b , knot c ( middle row ) was more extreme , increasing four - fold between 2000 and 2002 but then fading by a similar factor by december 2004 .",
    "in contrast , some ejecta knots such as knot d were nearly constant in flux ( within measurement uncertainties ) over nearly four years ( jan 2000  mar 2004 ) but then showed a substantial brightening over just nine months ( march to december 2004 ) .",
    "similarly , knot f ( second row from bottom ) showed an abrupt decrease in brightness between 2002 and 2004 .",
    "overall , an array of seemingly random brightness variability , both large and small , was observed not unlike that observed in the ne jet ejecta , except that here we actually observe flickering .",
    "while not all outlying eastern limb ejecta knot exhibit large brightness variations over the nearly five year time frame covered by these _ hst _ images , many knots did .",
    "increases or decreases in brightness by 25% or more were not uncommon .",
    "+   +   +   +     although most brightness changes appear uncoordinated , a few cases do suggest sequential brightening such as the closely spaced knots c and d ( fig .  5 , middle row ) .",
    "these two knots are located nearly directly east of the cas a expansion center with corresponding motions nearly due eastward . as noted above",
    ", knot c significantly brightened between 2000 and 2002 but then sharply faded by march 2004 .",
    "knot d , following closely behind knot c as seen in projection ( separation = @xmath120 ) , showed little change in flux between 2000 and march 2004 but a sharp increase in brightness by december 2004 .    as illustrated by the vertical line shown in figure 6 ,",
    "the location in the sky were both knots c and d brightened is nearly the same within @xmath121 suggesting they may have sequentially encountered a circumstellar or interstellar cloud ( not visible on these _ hst _ images ) at this spot which led to their shock excitation and hence optical brightening .",
    "this is consistent with their observed @xmath122 separation and their measured proper motion of @xmath123 per year @xcite .",
    "these values imply that knot d would have reached knot c s projected january 2002 position some 3.0 years later and this is exactly what is observed .",
    "knot c brightened in january 2002 roughly 3 years before knot d was observed to brighten in december 2004 .",
    "the _ hst _ images of cas a s outer ejecta knots also revealed a small percentage of knots ( @xmath124 5% ) with extended , trailing emission structures or ` tails ' typically @xmath1 in length .",
    "such trailing emission features were found in knots all across the remnant s outer periphery .",
    "figure 7 shows the locations of ten representative examples of knots with trailing emissions , with enlargements of combined december 2004 acs f675w + f775w images for these knots presented in figure 8 .",
    "trailing emissions were always found to be in excellent alignment with the knot s estimated direction of motion strongly suggestive of mass stripping .",
    "this tail  knot motion alignment is illustrated in figure 8 where each knot is shown twice , with ( right panel ) and without ( left panel ) an arrow drawn from the estimated remnant s center of expansion @xcite out to the knot s december 2004 location . in some cases",
    ", the trailing emission appears smooth in intensity away from the knot s head ( e.g. , knots 1 , 5 , 6 and 7 ) , whereas in other cases the trailing emission appears to show one or more trailing emission knots ( e.g. , knots 2 , 3 , and 9 ) .    in principle , these emission tails could be in part or wholly due to shock - excited csm or ism emission caused by the passage of these high - velocity ejecta .",
    "but this seems unlikely .",
    "comparisons of the knot fluxes in the acs filters f625w , f775w , and f850lp , shows no significance difference between a knot s head or its tail in terms of relative strengths .",
    "for example , if the tails were due to excited csm or ism , h@xmath113 and [ ] @xmath146548,6583 would then be expected to be the main emission contributors making the extended trailing emission mainly visible in the f625w images .",
    "however , this is not what is observed ; trailing emissions are visible in all three filter images consistent with the picture of mass ablation and/or partial knot disruption .",
    "a closer examination of a knot s trailing emission is shown in figure 9 where we present _ hst _ image enlargements of a ne jet ejecta knot with a bright emission tail @xmath125 long .",
    "this knot ( no .  429 ; @xcite ) lies in the central region of the ne jet .",
    "intensity plots shown in figure 10 indicate the trailing emission is some 50%  75% as bright as the knot head itself . in order to generate this level of emission ,",
    "the material in the tail likely represents a substantial amount of mass .",
    "the length and structure of the knot s trailing emission also changes slightly between the march and december images .",
    "for example , the knot s emission tail shows the presence of an emission clump in the trailing emission . the clump s position relative to the knot s head changes between march and december in both the f625w and f850lp images amounting to a shift of @xmath126 opposite of the knot s outward direction of motion .",
    "the knot has a measured proper motion of @xmath127 yr@xmath9 @xcite which converts to a transverse velocity of @xmath5 9700 km s@xmath9 at a distance of 3.4 kpc .",
    "thus , the smaller forward proper motion of the tail knot implies a lower transverse velocity by @xmath5 800 km s@xmath9 .",
    "this velocity difference , together with it relative brightness , suggests a deceleration of some portion of the main ejecta knot over this nine month time frame .",
    "ejecta knot flickering , ablation tails , and fragmentation are expected phenomena associated with the gradual dissolution of ejecta knots caused by their high - velocity interaction with an inhomogeneous circumstellar or interstellar medium . in the case of cas a s outer ejecta",
    "whose chemical abundances are significantly non - solar , such changes are subject to very different time scales and scale lengths than seen in other astrophysical settings ; e.g. , hh objects in t - tauri outflows .",
    "several groups have analyzed the dynamical interaction between sn ejecta and a surrounding low density medium @xcite .",
    "a standard feature of this interaction is that a slower shock is driven into the ejecta knot , which subsequently undergoes compression and lateral deformation .",
    "the knot s internal shock heating and subsequent cooling via radiative processes can generate substantial optical line emission . for cas a s outlying ejecta , the plasma s cooling rate will be enhanced significantly by their metal - rich abundances with additional cooling possible via metal ions sputtered off dust grains ( for discussions of dust in cas a ejecta see @xcite ) .",
    "the supersonic motion of the knot through the ambient medium will form a bow shock upstream of the cloud and a strong shear layer will develop at the knot s surface which is subject to the kelvin - helmholtz instability @xcite .",
    "the cloud will become compressed by the internal shock with its boundaries distorted by rayleigh - taylor and richtmyer - meshkov instabilities and by vortex generation as hot gas flows around the knot s edge .    in model simulations of a shocked ism cloud",
    ", a cloud is typically destroyed in several dynamical `` cloud - crushing times '' , @xmath128 , defined as the transit time for the internal shock to move entirely through the knot @xcite .",
    "the end result is that the cloud becomes fragmented , decelerated , and eventually shredded .",
    "one can gain some understanding of the relevant time scales for the interaction and microphysical processes with the following estimates .",
    "we consider a snr ejecta knot moving at velocity @xmath129 with respect to the ambient snr gas , of density @xmath130 @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "the knot - to - ambient density contrast ratio , @xmath132 , typically ranges from @xmath133@xmath134 @xcite .",
    "the internal shock moves through the knot at velocity @xmath135 .",
    "assuming @xmath136 km  s@xmath9  and @xmath137 , models show the internal shocks propagate at @xmath138 km  s@xmath9@xcite .",
    "the strong adiabatic shock compresses the gas , initially by a factor of 4 , and heats the post - shock gas to temperatures between @xmath139  k and @xmath140  k. the rankine - hugoniot temperature jump at the shock front is given by : @xmath141 for shocks of velocity @xmath142 and ionized gas with mean molecular weight @xmath143 .",
    "one can also define the characteristic time scales for knots of transverse size @xmath144 impacted by internal shocks of velocity @xmath145 and traversing a medium of density @xmath146 .",
    "as noted above , the internal shocks range from @xmath147 km  s@xmath9 , and the observed knot sizes are typically @xmath148 . at the 3.4 kpc distance estimated for cas",
    "a , an angular size of @xmath11 corresponds to a linear size of @xmath149 cm .",
    "the dynamical cloud crossing and gas cooling times are then : @xmath150 here , @xmath151 is the plasma metallicity in units of solar values , and the radiative cooling function @xmath152  erg  @xmath153  s@xmath154 .",
    "we define the temperature @xmath155 , where the cooling expression is valid over the range @xmath156 . at temperatures",
    "@xmath157 , the grain sputtering time is fairly constant @xcite , @xmath158 scaled to grains of radius @xmath159 m .",
    "thus , for temperatures @xmath160 and plasma densities @xmath161  @xmath131 , the grain sputtering time and plasma cooling time are nearly equal and both are comparable to the cloud - crossing time .",
    "+      the basic idea behind emission variations in sn ejecta is that decade - long variability like that seen in the remnant s main shell results from @xmath119100 km s@xmath9 shock - wave passage through ejecta knots with characteristic sizes around @xmath162 cm .",
    "smaller knots like those present in the remnant s outskirts and described in this paper allow for faster variability with timescales at or below a few years .",
    "understanding ejecta knot brightness variability involves both dynamical and radiative processes in the hot post - shock gas .",
    "as described by equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , the characteristic time scales for shock - crossing and radiative cooling of post - shock gas are similar , ranging from 30100 yr for densities @xmath163 @xmath131 , knot sizes @xmath164 cm , and solar metallicities @xmath165 .",
    "thus the slow , decades - long main shell brightness variations reported by @xcite and @xcite probably reflect the passage of shocks through large ejecta knots of angular size @xmath166 ( @xmath167 cm ) .",
    "shorter - term ( @xmath168  yr ) variations like those seen in the outer knots involve processes on much smaller scales , as these knots are compressed and fragmented by instabilities arising from the shock passage .",
    "such processes can be seen in the simulations of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite which show that a shocked cloud with a relatively homogeneous density structure will dissipated into a cluster of much smaller knots .",
    "ejecta knots will , if @xmath169 cm in size ( @xmath170 ) , exhibit optical variability on timescales around 1 yr or less .",
    "thus , the observed rapid shock - induced flux variations on timescales of less than one year suggests significant and dense knot substructures below the diffraction resolution limit of _",
    "hst_. however , we will show below in @xmath104.3 indications from the lengths of knot emission tails that knot variability is unlikely to be shorter than a few months .",
    "a secondary but important ingredient for creating rapid variability is a highly inhomogeneous interstellar or circumstellar medium . from a three year study of infrared light",
    "echoes around cas a , @xcite find that the remnant s local ism is highly inhomogeneous , consisting of sheets and filaments on a scale of a parsec or less .",
    "however , from our survey of outer knot flux variability , the remnant s circumstellar environment appears to have structures on even smaller scales .",
    "for example , the observed flickering of ejecta knots on times of months indicates interactions with small - scale csm features , as suggested by the rapid flickering of the eastern limb knots c and d ( fig .",
    "6 ) . in that case",
    ", the invisible csm cloud or sheet which knots c and d sequentially run into can not be much larger than @xmath121 or about @xmath171 pc .",
    "it is important to note that our investigation into rapid ejecta knot flux variations was limited by the shortest time interval between images , namely the nine - month separation of the 2004 acs images .",
    "since it is unlikely that these images captured a knot either at its maximum or its minimum flux brightness , the optical flux variations illustrated in figures @xmath117 and tabulated in tables 1 and 2 may not necessarily represent the shortest times by which knot substantially brighten or fade .",
    "for example , an ejecta knot could have brightened earlier than march 2004 and then begun to fade during our nine - month observing period , meaning that our measured flux variation represents only a minimum change in flux .",
    "similarly , if a knot brightened slowly , then our observed flux change is again a minimum value .",
    "larger flux changes over longer time scales are , in fact , suggested by the sudden appearance of knots in both the jet and eastern limb regions",
    ".      a knot will undergo deceleration both from the direct interaction with local gas as well as from the internal shock driven into the knot that gives rise to the optical emission observed @xcite .",
    "if individual ejecta fragments are treated as dense undistorted knots , then their deceleration due to drag from its interaction with the ambient medium depends on the knot s velocity and mass , the density of the local medium , and the cross - sectional area of the knot s bow shock , which for hypersonic conditions is approximately equal to the knot itself @xcite .",
    "the time scale for knot deceleration ( drag ) is given by @xmath172 @xmath119 @xmath173/@xmath129 where @xmath132 again is the density contrast between the knot and the ambient medium ( i.e. , @xmath174/@xmath175 ) , @xmath176 is the knot s radius , and @xmath129 is the knot s velocity @xcite . based on acs imaging data , typical outer knots have velocities of 10,000 km s@xmath9 and diameters @xmath177 to @xmath178 corresponding to @xmath179 cm at 3.4 kpc @xcite .",
    "high - velocity outlying [ s  ii ] emitting knots exhibit electron densities lie between @xmath180 @xmath131 with typical values between @xmath181 @xmath131 @xcite .    choosing @xmath132 = 10@xmath182 and an outer ejecta knot velocity of 10,000 km s@xmath9 leads to @xmath172 @xmath119 2000 yr , suggesting that outer knot deceleration due to drag may be fairly small .",
    "however , if the knot fragments into smaller knots as some models suggest @xcite , smaller knots will decelerate more rapidly owing to their larger surface area - to - mass ratios .",
    "a significant deceleration of cloud fragments would be consistent with observed lumps in the ablation tails of some ejecta knots like that shown in figures 8 and 9 .",
    "cloud - ism interaction models suggest knot disruption might also occur due to rayleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities resulting in both mass ablation tails as we observed in some knots and the generation of smaller , dense knot fragments @xcite .",
    "the timescale for initial knot breakup under these conditions , @xmath183 , is uncertain but is likely to be a few cloud crushing times or @xmath183 @xmath119 4 @xmath184/@xmath129 .",
    "model calculations by @xcite for a dense knot moving at 235 km s@xmath9 in a relatively dense medium but of similar size to the outer ejecta seen in cas a showed that deceleration of some of a knot s mass due to fragmentation of the knot will result in a hubble - like flow of ablated and stripped material flowing off the knot .",
    "the fact that most trailing emission tails we observed in cas a are relatively bright and sometimes clumpy suggest significant mass stripping and partial knot break - up .",
    "a possible example of knot fragmentation is knot 9 ( see fig .",
    "8) where the knot appears noticeably elongated in its direction of motion with a possibly associated fainter knot some @xmath185 behind which itself has some trailing emission .",
    "the length of an observed ablation tail is limited by the decline in emission measure ( @xmath186 ) as the hot post - shock gas expands and cools . because this stripped material may form a fairly a continuous medium of gas with similar velocities and densities detached from the main knot , tail material",
    "will not experience a strong internal shock .",
    "thus , trailing material should fade in brightness in a timescale roughly equal to the material s postshock cooling timescale .",
    "this can be estimated from the previous sections regarding knot variability and these data suggest a timescale for substantial fading on the order of several months . such a timescale is consistent with the observed length of knot emission tails .",
    "for example , proper motions of cas a s outer knots is @xmath119 @xmath187 yr@xmath9 @xcite meaning that a typical outer knot will move an angular distance roughly @xmath188 in a timespan of @xmath189 yr during which time its trailing ablated material cools and hence fades .",
    "this agrees well with what is observed .",
    "presumably all optical visible ejecta knots undergo some degree of mass loss due to shock instabilities on the front and sides of the ejecta knot . however , only a relatively small percentage ( @xmath190 5% ) of outer ejecta appear to have visible ablation tails on broadband _ hst _ acs images .",
    "@xcite found that knot fragmentation was key in producing significant wake emission . to investigate the formation of visible emission tails , we ran a series of model calculations similar to those presented in @xcite but where a knot of initial density @xmath191 @xmath131 and temperature of @xmath192 k and an oxygen abundance 100 times solar passed through a medium of density of @xmath193 @xmath131 with a velocity of 10,000 km s@xmath9 . under such conditions , a substantial tail in terms of emission measure",
    "was formed .",
    "our simulations also showed that with @xmath194 , the knot was disrupted too quickly to show a strong head  tail structure , whereas if @xmath195 then too little material was ablated in a trailing wake to be readily visible .",
    "prior model simulations of small knots have suggested that the inevitable instabilities associated with shock heating are likely to have short lifetimes on the order of @xmath196 @xcite , which for a @xmath197 diameter knot with an internal shock velocity @xmath5 100 km s@xmath9 is about 30 yr .",
    "this timeframe is consistent with observations of the brighter of cas a s outer ejecta knots which have been bright enough to be optically visible for several decades and some of these show emission tails in _ hst _ images .",
    "one example is the trailing emission knot 9 shown in figure 8 ( referred to as knot @xmath198 in @xcite ) which is visible on a deep red 1976 palomar 5  m photographic plate ( ph  7252vb : 098 - 04 emulsion + rg645 filter ; @xcite . thus this knot , which exhibits very weak h@xmath113 emission but strong [ ] emission lines , has been optically bright for nearly three decades @xcite .    finally , we note that the emission tails seen for cas a s outer ejecta knots appear morphologically different from the emission spikes or `` strings '' seen emanating from the @xmath2 carinae homunculus nebula @xcite .",
    "these long ( @xmath199 ) and thin ( @xmath200 ) emission features are thought to be decelerated ablated mass loss caused by the motion of @xmath201 km s@xmath9 ` bullets ' of ejected material moving through the star s surrounding circumstellar medium @xcite .    unlike the trailing emission features seen in cas a , however , the five @xmath2 carinae strings are not perfectly straight , they seem to fade in brightness with increasing distance from @xmath2 carinae , and show no obvious optical emission ` head ' or leading knot of emission .",
    "these properties are quite unlike what is observed in the trailing ablation flows associated with cas a s ejecta knots .",
    "the lack of an obvious knot at the tip of any of these emission strings has been attributed to very high postshock temperatures ( @xmath202 k ) initially present in the ablated material making them appear weak optically @xcite .",
    "interestingly , exactly the reverse is observed in cas a were we see emission directly attached to the hypersonic knots which have expansion velocities an order of magnitude greater that seen in @xmath2 carinae .",
    "we speculate that the emission strings seen in @xmath2 carinae represent ablation flows in which ejected knots are largely destroyed and dissolved by their passage through the relatively dense circumstellar medium around @xmath2 carinae .",
    "this would account for both the fading of the strings with increasing distance and the lack of any observable optical bullet head at the string tips .",
    "besides the noted clumpiness of some emission tails , there are additional indicators for the disruption and fragmentation of ejecta knots , in particular the break - up of relatively large ones .",
    "the evidence comes from the presence of several unusually tight clusters of ejecta knots present in the remnant s ne jet .",
    "these clusters consist of several closely spaced knots of similar size and brightness .",
    "four examples of such knot clusters present in the ne jet are shown in the upper panels of figure 11 .",
    "morphologically , these tight knot clusters appear similar to the results of shock models which show the fragmentation of a large ejecta knot into a tight cluster of small , denser knots @xcite . to illustrate this , we show in the lower panel of figure 11 model results from @xcite for the evolution of ejecta into a knot cluster over a timespan of a few cloud - crushing time scales . although the jet knot clusters are aspherical and hence look different morphologically from the spherical knot clusters seen in the model results , the exact structure knot clusters will of course depend upon the initial size and structure of the ejecta cloud prior to shock passage and is unlikely to be spherical",
    ".    other examples of small clusters of ejecta knots are two ejecta knot clusters situated along the remnant s northern periphery . although initially thought to be two single knots from inspection of ground - based images ( knots 15 and 15a ; see @xcite ) , _ hst _ images resolve them into two tight groups of knots each consisting of a dozen or so individual knots ( see on - line figure sets 2 & 3 for region h ; @xcite ) . the outlying knot 15 ( also known as knot 91 , @xcite ) is of special interest for estimating lifetimes of ejecta fragments formed from the fragmentation of a larger knot .",
    "although recently showing signs of fading , this group of ejecta knots has remained optically visible for nearly 60 years , being easily detected on one of the first optical images taken of the remnant , namely a november 1951 palomar 5  m plate ( ph 563b ; @xcite ) .",
    "we report results of a survey on outlying debris knots around the young core - collapse sn remnant cassiopeia a using _ hubble space telescope _ images .",
    "these images reveal ejecta knot flickering , ablation emission tails , and knot fragmentation which are phenomena associated with the initial stages of the gradual merger of sn ejecta with , and the enrichment of , the surrounding interstellar medium .",
    "\\1 ) substantial changes in the optical flux were seen in a significant percentage of the remnant s outer ejecta knots including the ne jet and eastern limb regions . in general , we detected no pattern in terms of brightness changes between three filters to suggest systematic changes in the line emissions between knot brightening or fading that might suggest a change of a knot s dominant ionization state .",
    "\\2 ) a variety of light curves was found with some knots going up and down in brightness ( ` flickering ' ) in times as short as nine months .",
    "flux changes typically ranged from 50% to 800% . while large brightness changes were only seen in a minority of jet emission knots ( @xmath10525% ) , smaller flux changes were apparent in a much larger percentage of knots approaching 50% .",
    "\\3 ) the observed flickering of ejecta knots on times of months indicates knot scale lengths @xmath169 cm ( i.e. , @xmath170 ) along with a highly inhomogeneous interstellar or circumstellar medium .",
    "knot interaction with small scale csm features is suggested by the rapid flickering of two eastern limb knots , c and d ( see fig .",
    "6 ) . in that case , the invisible csm cloud or sheet which knots c and d sequentially interacted with , leading to their sequential brightening , can not be much larger than @xmath121 or about @xmath171 pc .",
    "\\4 ) a small percentage ( @xmath1055% ) of knots were found to exhibit trailing emissions @xmath1 in length aligned along a knot s direction of motion suggestive of mass ablation tails due to high - velocity interaction with local csm and ism .",
    "these emission tails are bright relative to the knot suggestive of considerable ablated mass loss and could be either smooth or lumpy in intensity away from the knot s head . because these linear knot + tail features are relatively short and brighter near the knot , they are unlike the linear emission `` strings '' seen in @xmath2 carinae .",
    "\\5 ) we identified several tight clusters of ejecta knots which closely resemble fragmentation models for larger sn ejecta knots caused by a high - velocity interaction with a lower density ambient medium .",
    "archival images of cas a suggest that these knot clusters can survive and remain bright for several decades .",
