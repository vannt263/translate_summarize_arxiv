    "the discovery  @xcite of superconductivity at t@xmath5 k in magnesium diboride ( mgb@xmath4 ) is remarkable not only for its high critical temperature relative to conventional superconductors , but also because it has destroyed prejudices and created new hopes on electron - phonon ( e - ph ) superconductors .",
    "mgb@xmath4 crystallises in the alb@xmath4-type structure , also called c@xmath0 phase ( @xmath6 , no.191 ) ,  @xcite forming hexagonal layers of graphene - like sheets of b atoms intercalated with mg planes ; the synthesis and study of materials with the alb@xmath4 structure has therefore attracted a great deal of interest in the last few years .",
    "in the present paper we will focus on the ternary alloy caal@xmath1si@xmath2 , which has been recently synthesised  @xcite for a relatively wide range of composition @xmath3 and , in this range , has been reported to be isostructural to mgb@xmath4 , with honeycomb , graphene - like sheets of randomly distributed silicon and aluminium atoms , and alkaline - earth atoms intercalated between these sheets .",
    "@xcite superconductivity has been detected in the whole composition range ; the critical temperature t@xmath7 strongly depends on composition , showing a sharp peak at @xmath8 ( where t@xmath9 k ) , and dropping off rapidly as the al / si ratio departs from unity .",
    "@xcite    several experiments@xcite and _ ab initio _",
    "calculations  @xcite have concentrated on the @xmath8 case ( i.e. caalsi ) . concerning the superconducting mechanism , mazin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have suggested that the available experimental data could be reconciled with a traditional e - ph scenario , assuming the existence of a soft phonon mode ( @xmath10 30 - 40 @xmath11 ) ; recently huang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have calculated the phonon spectrum and electron - phonon coupling of caalsi , revealing the existence of a very soft ( and , at some wavevector , even unstable ) @xmath12 branch , which plays an important role in its superconducting properties ; they also claim that this mode , which gets softer under pressure , can be invoked to explain the positive pressure effect on t@xmath13 .",
    "@xcite    in contrast to the @xmath8 case , neither the wide stability range @xmath14 of of the c@xmath0 phase , nor its instability outside this range ( the limit of high aluminium or silicon concentration ) , nor any other physical property of caal@xmath1si@xmath2 has been , so far , theoretically studied as a function of composition , at least to our knowledge .",
    "our paper reports the first detailed _ ab initio _ analysis of the structural , electronic and vibrational properties of this ternary alloy , both in the composition range for which it has been actually synthesised , and outside it , in the theoretical limits of high aluminium and high silicon concentration .",
    "the former limit ( @xmath15 ) is of particular interest , since ca and al have the same valence configuration as mg and b , respectively , and , therefore , the hypothetical@xcite c@xmath0 phase of caal@xmath4 would not only be isostructural , but also isoelectronic to mgb@xmath4 , attracting attention as a possible new superconductor or , at least , as a relevant contribution to the understanding of mgb@xmath4 and related superconducting alloys.@xcite    the work is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sect : computational_details ] we briefly describe the computational details of our study , including the virtual crystal approximation adopted for a disordered alloy . in sec .",
    "[ sect : electrons_x=1 ] we discuss the electronic bands of the @xmath16 case , considering both an ordered phase with in - plane al - si ordering and the disordered alloy , and compare our results with previous calculations@xcite and arpes data .",
    "@xcite we also introduce a third , fictitious compound @xmath17alsi , with calcium ions replaced by a uniform background of positive charge , whose electronic bands will help us identify the role of calcium ions .",
    "the vibrational properties and the electron - phonon coupling in caalsi and @xmath17alsi are presented in sec .",
    "[ sect : e - ph ] while , in sec .",
    "[ sect : properties_doped ] , we describe how the different al / si content modifies the electronic and structural properties of caal@xmath1si@xmath2 .",
    "the electronic , structural and vibrational properties of all our crystals were calculated in the framework of the density functional theory@xcite and of the density functional perturbation theory@xcite , with kohn - sham wavefunctions expanded on a plane - wave basis limited by a 40 ryd cutoff energy .",
    "@xcite we used troullier - martins  @xcite norm - conserving pseudopotentials generated by the fhi98pp package  @xcite and consistently employed the gga - pbe functional  @xcite to approximate the exchange - correlation energy functional . the * k*-space integration ( electrons ) was approximated with a @xmath18 monkhorst - pack grid  @xcite for the self - consistent cycles ; with the more accurate tetrahedron method  @xcite and a @xmath19 mesh for the electronic density of states ( dos ) ; a @xmath20 monkhorst - pack grid for the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "after setting the smearing parameter  @xcite to 0.03 ryd , the electronic total energies were converged to 0.1 mry , while the phonon frequencies were converged within 5 @xmath11 with respect to the k - point sampling ; we checked that a different choice of the smearing parameter between 0.02 ryd and 0.04 ryd would not change our frequencies by more than 5 @xmath11 .",
    "dynamical matrices were evaluated for phonon wave vectors * q * on a @xmath21 grid , from which the phonon dispersion was obtained by fourier interpolation .    to describe a disordered caal@xmath1si@xmath2 alloy we employed the virtual crystal approximation ( vca )  @xcite , thus considering a @xmath6 structure where the sites of the hexagonal graphene sheets are occupied by an alchemical element",
    "whose ionic pseudopotential is defined as @xmath22 .",
    "the use of the vca permits us to investigate the whole composition range @xmath23 $ ] without introducing superstructures ( which on the other hand were not experimentally revealed in the samples examined with a powder @xmath24ray diffraction technique ) .",
    "@xcite the vca should be justified in our case , since al and si are neighbours in the periodic table and have a very similar electronic structure .",
    "the @xmath16 case requires a thorough discussion , since this is the composition to which most experimental and theoretical results refer .",
    "furthermore , there is still an open question concerning the actual crystal structure , whether a chemically disordered phase ( where each site of the hexagonal layers is randomly occupied by either al or si , with equal probability ) , or a crystal structure with some al / si ordering . the sharp @xmath28-ray diffraction patterns and the relatively high phase purity measured in caalsi ( as opposed to the case of caal@xmath1si@xmath2 with @xmath29 ) suggest a possible al / si ordering for @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite this is also what mazin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite suggest , proposing a crystalline structure with atomic in - plane ordering ( i.e. , graphene - like sheets with alternated al and si atoms ) of @xmath30 ( no .  187 ) symmetry ,  @xcite obviously lower than the c@xmath0 symmetry described above , and apparently favourable with respect to other possible ordering patterns .",
    "an analysis of powder @xmath28-ray diffraction patterns performed by imai  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite suggests , instead , the disordered phase .",
    "the question is still under debate and no conclusive experimental measure has been reported yet .    to elucidate this controversy we have repeated mazin s first - principles calculations , considering both the ordered @xmath30 structure and the disordered @xmath6 vca phase .",
    "our comparison of these results with the arpes experiments  @xcite gives additional arguments in favour of the ordered phase .",
    "moreover , the vca phase represents a crucial reference for our subsequent rigid - band model",
    ". hereafter we will indicate our disordered vca phase as ca(alsi ) and the ordered phase as caalsi .",
    "the caalsi and ca(alsi ) lattice parameters were obtained by optimizing the structural parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 up to a maximum residual stress of 1 mpa ; the numerical values are listed in table  [ table : lattice_parameters ] .",
    ".experimental lattice parameters at ntp@xcite and optimised lattice parameters for the ordered caalsi and the vca - disordered ca(alsi ) obtained in this work , based on gga - pbe exchange - correlation and pseudopotentials . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : ph_frequencies ]    the most striking feature is the presence of a very soft @xmath12 mode . first intuition , inspired by the corresponding mode in mgb@xmath4 and other diborides@xcite , would place this mode , which only involves vertical displacements of the lighter al and si atoms , at frequencies higher than those involving ca too . we find it , instead , as the lowest - frequency optical mode not only at the @xmath33 point ( table  [ table : ph_frequencies ] ) , but also in the entire  upper half \" of the bz ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phonons ] ) .",
    "this finding can be reconciled with the mass argument only by a much weaker vertical force constant ; and indeed , unlike the other compounds , caalsi has a partial filling of the @xmath34 bands in the `` upper half '' of the brillouin zone ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 path ) , which weakens the bond in the vertical direction .",
    "our phonon frequencies at @xmath33 ( table  [ table : ph_frequencies ] ) are in good agreement with all previous calculations ; the same agreement is found with the entire phonon spectrum obtained by huang _",
    "@xcite , with a notable exception : our @xmath12 branch ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : phonons ] ) has a frequency of @xmath10  50  @xmath11 and is almost dispersionless in the @xmath37 plane ; huang _ et al . _",
    "find , instead , imaginary frequencies along the a - l path .",
    "we find no such dynamical instability either there , or , in fact , in any other phonon branch and wavevector .",
    "our results agree with the overwhelming experimental evidence @xcite in favour of the structural stability of caalsi , and match the remarkable guess of mazin _ et al .",
    "_ , that , outside @xmath33 , a soft mode must be there at about 35 - 40 @xmath11 for a consistent explanation of both normal and superconducting properties .    in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : phonons ] , right side , the calculated eliashberg function @xmath38 , shown in red , is compared to the phonon dos , shown in blue .",
    "the eliashberg function evidently does not follow the phonon dos , and shows a pronounced peak at @xmath10 50 @xmath11 , clearly arising from the ( anomalously low ) @xmath12 branch .",
    "electrons mainly couple with this branch ; the largest contribution to the integrated superconducting parameter @xmath39 will appear along the @xmath33-a - l path .",
    "this coupling is mainly interband in character : a b@xmath40 displacement mixes the interlayer and @xmath34 bands , while , by symmetry , the corresponding @xmath41-@xmath41 coupling remains negligible @xcite .",
    "since , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sect : electrons_x=1 ] , fermi - level interlayer electrons are near @xmath42 = 0 , while fermi - level @xmath34 electrons are near @xmath43 , the electron - phonon coupling happens at wavevectors in the  upper half \" of the bz ( @xmath44 , @xmath36 path ) .",
    "the total @xmath39 , obtained as a weighted sum over individual phonon linewidths , is 0.66 .",
    "the critical temperature can then be estimated from the dynes equation @xmath45 with a calculated logarithmic average frequency of 151  k , and assuming @xmath46 , we obtain a t@xmath13 of 5.8  k , in reasonable agreement with the experimental t@xmath13 of 7.9  k.    in the lower panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : phonons ] we report the same vibrational properties ( phonon dispersion , dos and eliashberg function ) as in the upper panel , but calculated for the fictitious system @xmath17alsi .",
    "here we obviously have only 6 out of 9 phonon branches , since the ca atoms are missing .",
    "let us focus on the three optical modes , which correspond to the two e@xmath47 branches ( degenerate at @xmath33 ) and the b@xmath40 branch of the original compound .",
    "our results show that , while the two e@xmath47 modes are more or less unchanged , the substitution of ca ions with a uniform background of positive charge drives the b@xmath40 branch towards imaginary frequencies ( shown as negative in fig .",
    "[ fig : phonons ] ) across the entire brillouin zone , indicating that our fictitious compound is not stable in this structure .",
    "the eliashberg function @xmath38 ( red line ) is thus well defined for all branches except this one . at imaginary frequencies",
    "we may extend , as done here , its definition by taking their modulus .",
    "such an extended eliashberg function can not be integrated to yield a total @xmath39 , but may be used to illustrate the frequency distribution of the e - ph interaction,@xcite which turns out to be very similar to the real caalsi ( upper panel ) .",
    "this is not surprising , because in @xmath17alsi the relevant , gear - like structure of the fermi surface ( not shown ) is very similar to that of ordered and disordered caalsi ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bands_for_x=1 ] ) .",
    "the only difference is that , in the fictitious @xmath17alsi ( lower panel ) , the e - ph peak corresponding to the b@xmath40 branch , is shifted to negative frequencies ; we may therefore conclude that , although the ca ion is not so important to define the caalsi electronic bands at @xmath48 , it plays a crucial role for its structural stability , because , with respect to the equivalent jellium - like charge , a positive ion placed between al - si layers is more effective both in binding them and in hindering the al and si vertical displacements .    in summary",
    ", we find an entire phonon branch of imaginary frequencies in the fictitious compound @xmath17alsi , but we do not find any imaginary frequency in the phonon spectrum of the actual ( ordered ) caalsi , in contrast to previous , full - potential calculations . in caalsi",
    "we only find a very soft branch , which suggests the proximity of a structural transition .",
    "this single phonon mode , which is soft in the  upper half \" of the brillouin zone , dominates the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "we suspect that a similar situation also holds at compositions other than @xmath16 , and , in the following section , we explore in some detail the relation between lattice stability and band structure in the whole composition range .",
    "as we will see , the results confirm our hint , at least in the limit of high - aluminium concentration , and provide a useful reference and a strong motivation for a future , complete study of the electron - phonon interaction as a function of @xmath28 .     for caalsi .",
    "notice that the eliashberg function has a large peak around 50 @xmath11 , corresponding to the soft b@xmath40 branch .",

    "@xmath32 monotonically decreases with @xmath28 , while @xmath31 is almost constant .",
    "the small ( less than 3@xmath54 ) variations in the lattice parameters correspond to minor modifications in the band structure : in the experimental @xmath28-range the calculated electronic structure of caal@xmath1si@xmath2 ( not shown ) can be accurately described by a simple rigid - band model , where the fermi level changes only according to the different number of electrons per cell @xmath55 , see fig.[fig : bands_for_x=1 ] .",

    "then , outside this range , the rigid - band model completely breaks down .",
    "the dependence of @xmath52 on composition thus correlates with rigid - band and structural properties .",
    "its almost monotonic variation in the experimental range of stability @xmath3 does not , instead , correlate with the observed trend in the superconducting transition : the experimental t@xmath57 has a sharp peak at @xmath58 and drops off rapidly as the al / si ratio is changed in either directions .",
    "@xcite this suggests , by exclusion , that the experimental trend in t@xmath57 must be associated with changes of the phonon frequencies and/or electron - phonon coupling strength as a function of composition .      for @xmath59 the @xmath32 lattice parameter still increases as @xmath28 decreases , its slope being larger than in the experimental range of stability .",
    "much more peculiar is the behaviour of the @xmath31 parameter . reverting the trend observed in the experimental range of stability , @xmath31 decreases as @xmath28 decreases , until it equals the @xmath32 value , for @xmath60 ; then , at @xmath61 , it undergoes an abrupt change , such that the @xmath31/@xmath32 ratio jumps by @xmath62 .",

    "the entire caal@xmath4 ( @xmath64 ) phonon spectrum , shown in the lower panel of fig .",

    "this simple hint proves , however , incorrect , since , as already mentioned ( when discussing the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice_parameters_rigidband ] ) , the rigid band model breaks down for @xmath73 .",
    "we are going to make this statement more precise .",

    "the complete emptying of the @xmath41 band in the  upper half \" of the brillouin zone ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 path ) further weakens the bonds in the vertical direction , and this explains the appearance of imaginary frequencies in the out - of - plane phonon branches of the @xmath80 phase of caal@xmath1si@xmath81 for @xmath82 . the displacement corresponding to these phonons is compatible with the stable structure of caal@xmath4 at ambient condition , the mgcu@xmath4 laves phase , in which the al atoms sit on triangular layers intercalated by mixed ca ",

    "in this work we have reported first - principles calculations of the electronic and vibrational properties of the ternary alloy caal@xmath1si@xmath2 in the entire composition range @xmath95 , discussing how electronic , structural and vibrational properties are related to each other . in this context an interlayer band , which is empty in mgb@xmath4 , and whose bottom has ca-@xmath85 character in our compounds , plays a major role .    at @xmath16 the electronic band dispersion and fermi surfaces , calculated considering both an ordered phase with atomic in - plane ordering and a disordered vca phase , confirms the suggestion of mazin _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , that the compound crystallises in a completely in - plane ordered phase , if synthesised in presence of equal amounts of al and si .",
    "our calculation of the electron - phonon coupling confirms that the soft b@xmath40 phonon branch plays a major role in the superconductivity of caalsi , and shows that this mode couples the interlayer and @xmath34 bands . at variance with a previous full - potential calculation",
    ", we do not find any instability in the phonon spectrum of caalsi .    at @xmath96 , in the experimentally accessible composition range ,",
    "the caal@xmath1si@xmath2 electronic bands are accurately described by a rigid - band model ; in this range @xmath52 monotonically increases with @xmath28 , so that the measured non - monotonic variations in the superconducting properties can not be associated with changes in the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "these findings provide a useful reference and a strong motivation for a future , complete study of the electron - phonon interaction as a function of @xmath28 .",
    "the rigid - band model breaks down for @xmath97 , where the increasing aluminium content mainly leads to the emptying of the @xmath41 bonding band , which finally drives the compound unstable .",
    "the occurrence of such a dynamical instability is related to an abrupt change in the @xmath77 ratio and correlates with the persistence of the interlayer band at the fermi level , related to the pinning of the ca-@xmath85 states .",
    "therefore , although isostructural and isoelectronic with mgb@xmath4 , the c@xmath0 phase of caal@xmath4 is unstable and does nt share strong similarities with its electronic bands .",
    "the main result of this work is that the interlayer band , empty in mgb@xmath4 , and the  out - of - plane \" phonons ( optical @xmath12 and acoustical @xmath66 at @xmath33 ) , irrelevant for superconductivity in mgb@xmath4 , play a major role on the stability and superconductivity of c@xmath0 intermetallic compounds , once the structural parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 assume appropriate values .",
    "this observation goes beyond the caalsi family and represents the starting point for further studies of a wider class of hexagonal , graphite - like compounds .",

    "caal@xmath4 crystallises in the so - called mgcu@xmath4 laves phase , and , when doped with li or mg , in the mgni@xmath4 and mgzn@xmath4 phases .",
    "@xcite ; while theoretical and experimental work exists on these transitions , the effect of si doping is still unexplored .                                                    in some cases ,",
    "when there is a clear experimental hint for the stability of a certain compound in a given structure , and when the instability is limited to a few * q*-points , it is possible to use a generalized approach to include the contribution of phonons with small , imaginary frequencies to the total electron - phonon coupling .",
