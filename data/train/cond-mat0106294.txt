    "in recent years , local enhancement of superconductivity has been predicted to provide the mechanism to induce several intriguing interfacial phase transitions in type - i superconductors @xcite .",
    "typical phase diagrams are calculated using the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory in which the enhancement is accounted for by allowing the extrapolation length @xmath1 to be negative .",
    "the microscopic origin of this parameter remains an unsolved problem making the experimental verification of the theoretical results non - trivial .",
    "so far , the most feasible realization of a negative extrapolation length seems to originate from the concept of twinning - plane superconductivity ( tps ) , a well understood phenomenon that occurs , e.g. , in sn , in , nb , re and tl @xcite . a twinning plane ( tp )",
    "is a defect plane representing the boundary between two single - crystal regions or twins and , consequently , the physics encountered in the behaviour of a superconducting / normal interface near tp s is the natural analogy to grain - boundary wetting or interface depinning , a topic which has been well studied in magnetic systems @xcite .",
    "the characteristic feature of the original gl approach of tps is the a priori assumption that the tp is perfectly transparent for electrons at the microscopic level which implies that the superconducting order parameter @xmath2 is continuous at the tp @xcite .",
    "subsequent extensions of the theory relax this assumption allowing a discontinuity in @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "more specifically , a second phenomenological parameter , @xmath0 , is introduced to describe the coupling between the twins such that , by means of @xmath0 , one can mimic the effect of microscopically tuning the tp from completely transparent to completely opaque for electrons . in this paper",
    "we present an overview of the variety of interfacial phase transitions in the two limiting cases to develop a thorough understanding of the influence of the transparency .",
    "earlier work  @xcite has focused on the case of mixed bulk boundary conditions with the bulk normal ( n ) phase on one side and the bulk superconducting ( sc ) phase on the other side of the tp , at bulk two - phase coexistence .",
    "this is appropriate for the study of the proper depinning transition of an interface that is initially pinned at the tp .",
    "here we choose to settle for the configuration of equal bulk conditions , that is , we impose the bulk n phase on both sides of the tp . in",
    "so doing we are no longer restricted to the case of bulk two - phase coexistence and this allows us to establish the complete magnetic field versus temperature phase diagram for a given material .",
    "this type of diagram is accessible to experimental verification and is relevant for comparing the present results with known tps phase diagrams  @xcite .",
    "the solutions of the gl equations strongly depend on the boundary conditions imposed at the tp itself which in turn relates to the level of transparency , i.e. the value of @xmath0 .",
    "for highly transparent planes , corresponding to the limit @xmath3 , it is natural to consider fully symmetric profiles for the order parameter . in the opposite limit , @xmath4",
    ", the tp is completely opaque for electrons and both sides are largely independent . in this case",
    "there is a wide range of possible solutions , including profiles with @xmath2 identically zero at one side of the tp .",
    "the latter are refered to as _ wall _ solutions , since they are equivalent to the ones found in a type - i superconductor with an external surface or wall characterized by a negative extrapolation length @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "therefore we anticipate that , in the opaque limit , we will recover to a great extent the results of a wall system .",
    "this is very different from the case of complete transparency , for which drastic qualitative modifications are predicted compared to the case with a wall .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we collect the main ideas of the gl theory applied to twinning - plane superconductors .",
    "section  [ sec : transp ] covers the results for perfectly transparent tp s .",
    "we calculate in detail the phase diagrams and provide a comparison with the predicted tps diagrams as described in ref .",
    "the fully opaque system is the subject of section  [ sec : opaque ] .",
    "we present a classification of the various solutions and establish their stability to derive the phase behaviour .",
    "we summarize our main results and discuss the experimental relevance in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we consider a type - i superconductor with a tp located at @xmath5 and impose on both sides the n phase , with @xmath6 , as the bulk condition .",
    "the gl free - energy functional has the form @xmath7=\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}{\\cal g}[\\psi,{\\bf a}]{\\rm d}x+ \\gamma_{\\rm tp}(\\psi_-,\\psi_+ ) , \\label{eq : gammatp1}\\ ] ] with the free - energy density @xmath8 given by @xmath9 ^ 2}{2\\mu_0}. \\label{eq : enedens}\\ ] ] as usual , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the bulk critical temperature which must be distinguished from the second critical temperature in the system , @xmath12 , below which local superconductivity sets in at the tp in zero magnetic field .",
    "since @xmath13 was experimentally @xcite proved to be only slightly higher than @xmath11 , the use of the gl theory is justified .",
    "further , @xmath14 is a stabilizing parameter and @xmath15 is the vector potential .",

    "in addition , we have followed others  @xcite by adding a second term in ( [ eq : localenetp ] ) to describe the coupling between the twins . in so doing ,",
    "we allow the sc wave function to be discontinuous across the tp , hence in general @xmath23 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath0 can be expressed in terms of the fermi velocity and either the transmission or reflection coefficient for electrons , thus fully in terms of microscopic properties  @xcite .",
    "we note that for @xmath24 , the phase of the wave function is continuous at the tp , while for @xmath25 a phase jump of @xmath26 can occur  @xcite .",
    "we omit the latter possibility and restrict our attention to @xmath27 .    in what follows",
    "we assume translational invariance in the @xmath28- and @xmath29-directions and choose the gauge so that @xmath30 .",
    "it proves to be convenient to adopt the rescaling introduced in earlier work  @xcite using the two basic length scales of the superconductor , i.e. the zero - field coherence length @xmath31 and the magnetic penetration depth @xmath32 defined by @xmath33 the ratio of @xmath32 to @xmath31 gives the gl parameter @xmath34 , with @xmath35 for type - i materials .",

    "clearly , @xmath46 attains the value 1 in the bulk sc phase . finally , we rescale the free energy @xmath47 divided by the surface area @xmath48 such that @xmath49 , yielding @xmath50 = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } dx\\left\\ { \\pm\\varphi^2+\\frac{\\varphi^4}{2}+\\dot{\\varphi}^2 + \\frac{a^2\\varphi^2}{\\kappa^2}+(\\dot a -h ) ^2 \\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\   + \\frac{\\xi}{b}(\\varphi_-^2+\\varphi_+^2 ) + \\frac{\\xi}{\\alpha_{{\\rm tp}}}(\\varphi_--\\varphi_+)^2 .",

    "minimization of @xmath53 with respect to @xmath46 and @xmath40 yields the well - known gl equations @xmath54 and @xmath55 in addition , two coupled boundary conditions are obtained from stationarity with respect to @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 while the vector potential and its first derivative must be continuous at @xmath5 , @xmath60 in the subsequent sections we aim at solving the above equations for both the transparent and the opaque limit .",
    "for highly transparent tp s , @xmath3 and we recover the original description of tps @xcite with a continuous order parameter at the tp , thus @xmath61 . consequently , it is natural to look for fully symmetric solutions for @xmath62 of the differential equation  ( [ eq : gleqtp1 ] ) . in practice",
    "this is done by initially restricting ourselves to one half space , say @xmath63 .",
    "the solution in the other half space @xmath64 can then be constructed using @xmath65 , with @xmath62 the solution for the semi - infinite system .",
    "note that this makes the problem very similar to the one of a semi - infinite system with an external surface  @xcite , the only difference emerging from the behaviour at @xmath5 which is manifested most clearly in the boundary condition for the vector potential .",
    "indeed , in the presence of an external surface , stationarity of @xmath53 with respect to @xmath66 results in @xmath67 . in the present situation , however ,",
    "owing to the assumed symmetry in the profile for @xmath62 the vector potential @xmath68 will be anti - symmetric with respect to @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath69 and thus obeys the condition @xmath70 .",
    "the boundary conditions for the wave function reduce in this limit to @xmath71    in the following analysis , we will be interested in two types of solutions distinguished by their asymptotic behaviour for @xmath72 .",
    "the enhancement of superconductivity near the tp will typically induce a sc sheath ( with the bulk of the system prepared in the n phase ) and it is precisely the thickness of this surface sheath that characterizes the solution .",
    "clearly , if this thickness is finite superconductivity disappears for @xmath73 and the magnetic field penetrates such that @xmath74 adapting the terminology of  @xcite which follows from the analogy to wetting transitions in adsorbed fluids @xcite , this solution is referred to as a _ partial wetting _ state .",
    "we remark that this class of solutions also includes the so - called null solution without any sc phase in the system ( thus describing a sc sheath with zero thickness ) . on the other hand , in the case of _",
    "complete wetting _ the sheath can be macroscopically thick so that it fully separates the n phase from the tp .",
    "these solutions are possible only when the magnetic field equals the thermodynamic critical field @xmath75 at which there is bulk two - phase coexistence between the n and sc phase . instead of eq.([eq :",
    "bulktranstp1 ] ) they obey the asymptotic conditions @xmath76 remarkably , the calculation of this class of solutions is very simple and analytic results can be obtained for the entire type - i regime .",
    "indeed , the asymptotic condition for the vector potential along with the boundary condition at @xmath5 imply that @xmath77 and we are left with a single differential equation for @xmath62 taking the simplified form , for @xmath45 , @xmath78 with the solution @xmath79 $ ] , for @xmath63 , and where @xmath80 is determined by the boundary condition  ( [ eq : boundtptrans ] )  @xcite .",
    "this solution must then be combined with a sc / n interface in the limit of @xmath72 as necessary to obey the bulk n condition as initially imposed .",
    "this combination defines a macroscopic sc layer . for general values of @xmath34",
    ", the sc / n interface , as well as the solutions describing a finite sc sheath , must be determined numerically . at bulk two - phase coexistence",
    "the two solutions described above may occur yielding an interface delocalization transition ( or a wetting transition ) .",
    "this transition describes the delocalization of the sc / n interface from the tp into the bulk of the material away from the tp .",
    "we now address the analysis of this phase transition .      in fig.[fig :",
    "twinfig1 ] we show the phase diagram for a type - i superconductor with a transparent tp as a function of the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath81 .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath41 is fixed to its coexistence value @xmath82  @xcite .",
    "varying the temperature for a given material , i.e. for fixed @xmath34 , corresponds to traveling horizontally in the diagram .",

    "however , there remains some coupling between the two half - spaces due to the vector potential and the magnetic induction which must both be continuous at the tp .",
    "moreover , the number of possible solutions is further restricted by the assumption that the extrapolation length @xmath1 is equal on both sides of the tp .",

    "[ fig : twinfig3](a ) ) is stable for a certain interval of @xmath81 values provided that @xmath158 as can be inferred from the results for a system with a wall  @xcite .",
    "hence , in the upper right corner of the diagram we retrieve a feature of the wall diagram , with a finite sheath on only one side of the tp while the other side is still in the n phase , thus @xmath159 and @xmath160 . in the lower half of the diagram we have on the low-@xmath161 side a region where no stable sheath solution exists other than the null solution ( @xmath162 and @xmath160 ) .",
    "the two regions are separated either by the line cn ( critical nucleation ) ending in a tricritical point tcp , or by the short stretch fn ( first - order nucleation ) between tcp and a critical end point cep .",
    "to the left of tcp the line cn continues as the metastability limit @xmath163 of the null solution .",
    "next we need to consider the solutions of fig .",
    "[ fig : twinfig4 ] and  [ fig : twinfig5 ] and to investigate their stability .",
    "our calculations suggest that when the temperature is increased towards @xmath11 the system first enters the state given in fig .",
    "[ fig : twinfig4](a ) , either from one finite sheath or from the null solution .",
    "these transitions are indicated by the line cd ( critical delocalization ) and fd ( first - order delocalization ) respectively , meeting each other at the cep . by further increasing the temperature the system undergoes a _ first - order depinning transition _ towards the double symmetric solution , i.e. a transition from the solution given in fig .",
    "[ fig : twinfig4](a ) towards the solution of fig .",
    "[ fig : twinfig5 ] .",
    "thus the regions @xmath164 , @xmath160 and @xmath165 are separated by the first - order phase boundary fdp ( first - order depinning ) .",
    "lastly , the line @xmath166 represents the metastability limit of the state with @xmath164 , @xmath160 , with the sc / n interface pinned at the tp .",
    "note that the solutions represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : twinfig4](b ) and  ( c ) are never stable .",
    "an important conclusion that we draw from this phase diagram is that for relatively low temperatures an opaque tp behaves as a system with a wall , with on one side of the tp the different wall solutions while the other side remains fully in the n phase .",
    "in other words , to the right of the line fdp in fig .  [",
    "fig : twinfig6 ] we immediately obtain the phase diagram by copying the results for a wall without additional computations .",
    "all the details concerning the determination of the transition lines for this part of the diagram can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the critical delocalization condition reads @xmath167 while the first - order delocalization condition is simply given by @xmath168 where @xmath169 ( @xmath170 ) is the surface free energy of the bulk n ( sc ) phase against a wall . the novel feature in fig .",
    "[ fig : twinfig6 ] is the fdp line arising from the possibility of having a macroscopic sc layer also in the other region leading to a depinning transition at higher temperatures along with the associated spinodal @xmath166 .",
    "it is precisely these two transition lines that we will be concentrating on in the remainder of this section .",
    "the condition for the first - order depinning transition is obtained by equating the free energy of the solution with one macroscopic layer at @xmath63 and no sheath at @xmath64 to that of the solution with the double symmetric macroscopic sc layer .",
    "the former can be written conveniently as the sum @xmath171 , thus the depinning condition reads @xmath172 in general the depinning phase boundary has to be calculated numerically .",
    "an approximate analytic result can be obtained using the powerful expansions in @xmath34 for the surface free energies . for the surface tension @xmath93",
    "we use the result  ( [ eq : gammascnanalyt ] ) while a similar expansion has been derived for @xmath170 in ref .",
    "@xcite . using these earlier results in the depinning condition  ( [ eq : depinopaqtp ] ) provides a very accurate approximation for the phase boundary across the complete type - i range with an error less than @xmath173 . for @xmath101 the depinning and",
    "the delocalization transitions coincide at @xmath102 .",
    "both phase boundaries have a parabolic foot near @xmath101 , i.e. @xmath174 with @xmath175 for depinning and @xmath104 for delocalization  @xcite . from a mathematical point of view",
    "it is interesting to examine whether the extensions of the lines fdp and cd meet in the type - ii regime , for @xmath176 .",
    "the condition for a line crossing is given by combining  ( [ eq : critopaqtp ] ) and  ( [ eq : depinopaqtp ] ) .",
    "explicit calculations using an expansion in @xmath34 for the line cd obtained in  @xcite reveal indeed an intersection at @xmath177 , @xmath178 .",
    "the line @xmath166 marks the nucleation of an infinitesimal sheath on one side of the tp under the condition that on the other side of the tp a macroscopic sheath is stable . to obtain this line",
    "we first compute numerically a solution for a macroscopic layer in one half space , @xmath63 say , for a given value of @xmath81 subject to the condition @xmath67 .",
    "to proceed we combine it with a solution of the linear gl theory applied to the region @xmath64 using the scheme introduced in section  [ sec : transp ] .",
    "the zeroth - order solution for the vector potential is again given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gleqtp2lin ] ) with in this case @xmath179 determined by the value of @xmath66 which we get from the numerical calculation in @xmath63",
    ". finally we have to compare @xmath180 with the given value of @xmath81 and iterate the procedure such that the two become equal .",
    "this defines the critical nucleation of the sheath in the region @xmath64 . the line @xmath166 is now formed by applying this method for the coexistence field @xmath181 .",
    "the procedure is equally applicable for any other field appropriate for the study of off - of - coexistence phenomena , an issue which is addressed below .      from the properties of an opaque tp at bulk coexistence elucidated above we anticipate that the onset of local superconductivity near this plane generally happens in two steps .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the stability of  wall solutions \" in these systems with @xmath149 on one side of the tp while on the other side the sc phase has already nucleated .",
    "we now wish to concentrate on the various nucleation phenomena , the order of which depends on the parameter @xmath34 , as a function of magnetic field and temperature .    for @xmath182",
    "the delocalization transition on one side of the tp is first - order and thus will have a prewetting extension into the region of the phase diagram where the n phase is stable in bulk .",
    "this prewetting line fn is the first - order nucleation of a sheath on one side of the tp , and hence corresponds to the transition between the null solution and a solution as given in fig .",
    "[ fig : twinfig3](a ) .",
    "this line will be tangential to the bulk coexistence line cx at the first - order delocalization point d and changes at the tricritical point tcp into a continuous nucleation line cn .",
    "the latter describes the nucleation of one infinitesimal sheath and continues as the metastability limit @xmath183 of the null solution to the left of tcp .",
    "so far the surface phase diagram , an example of which is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : twinfig7 ] for @xmath127 , resembles the diagram for the system with a wall  @xcite .",
    "note that we use the same units as in fig .",
    "[ fig : twinfig2 ] .    as we have argued above , however , another distinct point exists at bulk coexistence at higher temperatures but still below @xmath11 , namely the first - order depinning point dp .",
    "the presence of the depinning transition leads to a variety of additional transitions compared to the wall system .",
    "indeed , due to the first - order character of this point a second first - order nucleation line @xmath184 appears , attached to the point dp .",
    "this phase boundary can be interpreted as a _ predepinning _ line .",
    "for the sake of clarity this line is omitted in the main figure , with all the details near the depinning transition given in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : twinfig7 ] . at the line",
    "@xmath185 the sc phase nucleates on the other side of the tp , hence it is the transition between one sheath and a double sheath .",
    "the line @xmath185 is tangential to the line cx at dp and meets a continuous nucleation line @xmath186 at a second tricritical point @xmath187 . to the left of @xmath187",
    ", @xmath186 continues as the metastability limit @xmath166 of the state with one sheath .",
    "obviously @xmath186 denotes the critical nucleation of the second sc sheath .",
    "the two critical nucleation lines end in zero field at the same point @xmath188 which follows from the assumption that the tp is characterized by a single value of the parameter @xmath1 .    for materials with @xmath189 for which the delocalization transition is critical , the field - temperature phase diagram will undergo qualitative changes as regards the wetting - like transitions , i.e. , the transitions related to the nucleation of the sc phase on _ one _ side of the tp .",
    "we refer interested readers to ref .",
    "@xcite for examples of @xmath190-phase diagrams containing these nucleation transitions and restrict ourselves here to a brief discussion of the pertinent features relevant for the present study . for @xmath191 the point d and the starting point of the first - order nucleation line fn separate and by further increasing @xmath34 this first - order transition disappears .",
    "the critical nucleation line cn then extends to low temperatures without intersection with the bulk coexistence line cx . hence in this case",
    "the nucleation of the first sheath is always critical . for the nucleation of the second sheath",
    "there is still the possibility of first - order as well as second - order transitions .",
    "in fact , we know that the depinning transition is first - order for all type - i materials so that the situation that we sketched for @xmath127 near the depinning point dp is representative for the entire type - i regime .",
    "thus for an _ opaque _ tp there are always two distinct nucleation transitions , i.e. the sc phase never appears simultaneously on both sides of the tp .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the phase behaviour of the sc / n interface near internal tp s in type - i superconductors .",
    "our calculations reveal that the results are highly sensitive to the boundary conditions imposed at the tp , which in turn depend on the degree of transparency of the tp for electrons . for perfectly transparent tp",
    "s the order parameter is continuous such that only symmetric profiles need to be considered and at first sight the analysis resembles that of an external surface or wall .",
    "the only differences originate from the boundary condition for the vector potential and , surprisingly , this small technical modification turns out to have dramatic consequences for the order of the delocalization transition . in particular , _ for a transparent tp only first - order transitions are found for the entire type - i regime _ while the possibility of critical transitions that are predicted for the wall system  @xcite are suppressed .",
    "our results for the magnetic field versus temperature phase diagrams are in excellent agreement with earlier experimental and theoretical results obtained in the context of tps  @xcite .",
    "we comment further that our approach for the _ nucleation _ of the sc phase near the tp equally applies to type - ii materials ( with @xmath192 ) .",
    "specifically , we have considered the case of nb with @xmath193 for which the experimental results suggest that the properties of the tp are very close to the limiting case of perfect transparency .",
    "the nucleation transition in this case is always of second - order and our results again perfectly agree with earlier work  @xcite .",
    "we remark that in this case the nucleation lines are only relevant at sufficiently high fields above their intersection with the upper critical field @xmath194 .",
    "the situation drastically changes when considering opaque tp s in which case a discontinuity in the order parameter is allowed at the tp .",
    "the decoupling of the two sides of the tp makes it possible to consider wall solutions with @xmath149 on one side of the tp .",
    "moreover , from free - energy considerations , we have shown that these solutions are stable in a large region of the phase space and , as a result , the system precisely undergoes the transitions predicted for a wall system . in this case",
    "only one side of the tp will be wetted by the sc phase at the delocalization transition which can be either first - order or critical depending on the value of @xmath34 . by further increasing the temperature at bulk coexistence a first - order depinning transition",
    "is predicted for all type - i materials .",
    "consequently , the field - temperature phase diagrams for opaque tp s fundamentally differ from their counterparts for the transparent limit .",
    "a characteristic feature of an opaque tp is the existence of two distinct nucleation lines which in principle should be measurable and thus can _ provide an experimental means of distinguishing between transparent and opaque tps_. related to this we remark that experiments in sn ( @xmath195 ) have revealed only one nucleation transition , although it is assumed that the twin boundary in this material has a low transmission for electrons  @xcite .",
    "the apparent absence of a second nucleation transition can in this case be attributed to the low-@xmath34 value of the material , since in the low-@xmath34 regime the various transition lines lie extremely close together ( see fig .  [ fig : twinfig6 ] ) and they would be difficult to distinguish in an experiment . note that in the limit @xmath196 the differences between a transparent tp , an opaque tp and an external surface vanish .",
    "finally , for type - ii materials with opaque tp s our calculations show that the nucleation can be either first - order or critical and this is at variance with the conclusion of earlier work  @xcite stating that the tps transition is always second - order for type - ii materials .",
    "our study demonstrates that this surmise is correct only for the case of transparent tp s .",
    "the reason for this is that the tricritical nucleation point tcp merges with the delocalization transition at @xmath100 for transparent tp s .",
    "this can be seen also from the merging of the spinodal ml with the line fd in fig .",
    "[ fig : twinfig1 ] .",
    "in contrast , for opaque tp s the tcp of nucleation remains well off of coexistence , at @xmath197 , and in the type - ii regime at @xmath198 , so that there is room for first - order nucleation .",
    "this is further demonstrated by the fact that , in fig .",
    "[ fig : twinfig6 ] , the lines @xmath166 and fd are still far apart at @xmath100 .    one remarkable implication of our work is that , in general , with the exception of perfectly transparent tp s , there exist stable states of local superconductivity which are _ asymmetric _ about the tp .",
    "the possibility that a sc sheath or a macroscopic sc layer can occur on one side of the tp while the other side is in the normal state is indeed noteworthy and has been met with scepticism .",
    "it has been suggested that , since our analysis is essentially one - dimensional and neglects states which are inhomogeneous in the direction(s ) parallel to the tp , there may exist modulated states , e.g. , composed of a linear array of soft vortices parallel to the tp  @xcite or states with a local field penetration and a change of phase of the wave function , which may have a lower free energy than the states we have considered  @xcite . although we can not rule out this possibility at present , we would like to point out that asymmetric wetting , followed by symmetric depinning , has been found previously in the context of grain - boundary wetting  @xcite , in the framework of a real scalar order parameter model of ising type .",
    "we thank chris boulter , todor mishonov and alexander buzdin for stimulating discussions .",
    "this research has been supported by the belgian fund for scientific research ( fwo - vlaanderen ) , the inter - university attraction poles ( iuap ) and the concerted action research programme ( goa ) .",
    "most of the results of this paper have been obtained in the framework of two theses  @xcite .",
    "this value for the thermodynamic field @xmath181 is easily inferred from the functional for @xmath53 , eq.([eq : gammatp2 ] ) .",
    "indeed , the free energy density approaches in the bulk sc state the value @xmath199 and thus @xmath53 would diverge unless @xmath200 ."
