    "electrokinetic phenomena in microstructures have implications in different technological applications and have been attracting significant attention .",
    "these microstructures can be either fabricated with specified geometry , such as in microfluidics ( figure ( [ fig : chip ] ) ) , or involve random porous media ( figure ( [ fig : porous ] ) ) made of either conducting or non - conducting materials . in this paper",
    "we collectively refer to these systems as _ network of pores_. microfluidic lab - on - a - chip devices are widely used to analyze biological entities and perform processes including mixing , separation @xcite , and biomolecular detection @xcite . on a larger scale , electrokinetics in porous media is shown to have practical relevance for a wide variety of applications from filtration , desalination @xcite , and fluid pumping @xcite , to energy storage @xcite and highly efficienct energy conversion @xcite .",
    "a number of these applications involve transport nonlinearities induced when pores with different geometrical and electro - chemical properties are connected @xcite . below we describe aspects of physical complexities associated with a network of pores .",
    "+    0.38        0.5        0.27     0.3     ion concentration polarization ( icp ) is a well known phenomenon @xcite that is described by induced concentration gradient in systems where ion selectivity varies in the direction of transport . in the context of porous networks ,",
    "icp can occur when pores of varying cross sections are connected in series @xcite or t - junctions @xcite as well as in pore - membrane junctions @xcite .",
    "wang et al .",
    "@xcite reported the use of icp to generate high - focusing ratios of an ionic protein near a microchannel - nanochannel junction . by examining different systems of pores ,",
    "kim et al .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that icp dynamics can be exploited for a variety of applications including energy efficient desalination systems and biomolecule preconcentration devices .",
    "+ mani , zangle , and santiago @xcite performed an extensive numerical - experimental study on the propagation of icp enrichment and depletion zones at galvanostatic ( constant current ) and potentiostatic ( constant potential ) conditions .",
    "they showed that under certain circumstances , icp enrichment and depletion regions could spread as shocks ( figure ( [ fig : icp_shock ] ) ) , which are driven by both electromigration and diffusion .",
    "mani and bazant @xcite referred to the propagation of depletion zone as deionization shock , and explained in detail the underlying physics of the shock and its stability in pores with slow variation of surface charge and geometry .",
    "they illustrated how the nonlinear dynamics of deionization shock result from exchanges between bulk and surface conduction carried by the excess charge in the edls .",
    "other related studies have analyzed the overlimiting current through porous material subject to icp @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that in these systems , a novel mechanism for overlimiting current exists due to surface conduction which is activated after deionization shocks propagate through pores@xcite .",
    "however , coupling between surface conduction and deionization shocks in networks of many pores is yet to be understood .",
    "+ additional complexity arises when pores are connected in parallel in a network .",
    "as we will demonstrate , such connections can lead to flow loops and enhanced mixing when pores with different properties are connected to each others ( figure ( [ fig : recirculation ] ) ) .",
    "+ all of the aforementioned effects occur on the scale of pore length or intersection distance in a network , and therefore , traditional homogenization models fail to capture such phenomena . on the other hand ,",
    "full numerical simulation of electrokinetic transport in three - dimensional porous media is prohibitively expensive and infeasible for large networks of pores .",
    "one technique to overcome the present barriers is the utilization of area - integrated models , which are developed based on the principle of local thermodynamic equilibrium in the pore cross - section dimension .",
    "this approach reduces the transport equations to a one - dimensional model for each pore , which relates the cross - section averaged fluxes including fluid velocity @xmath0 , electric current density @xmath1 , and ion fluxes @xmath2 to the local driving forces with prefactors .",
    "the prefactors are area - averaged quantities that take into account the non - uniformity of the concentration profile across edls . for long and thin pores ,",
    "the driving forces are proportional to gradients of driving potential functions describing a combination of pressure , concentration , and electrostatic fields .",
    "as we will see , these driving potentials can be constructed such that they only depend on longitudinal coordinates in each pore while remaining uniform in cross - sectional planes .",
    "such potential functions , which are most suitable for model reduction , are also referred to as virtual quantities in the literature @xcite .",
    "the driving forces and their potential functions can be expressed in different ways . in our modeling , we introduce three forces in the form of gradients in virtual total pressure ( @xmath3 ) , virtual electro - chemical potential for counterions ( in our case , @xmath4 given that there is negative surface charge ) , and virtual concentration ( @xmath5 ) . later in this section , we will illustrate the reason of this choice by declaring the key advantages of these driving potentials over the other forms represented in the literature .",
    "detailed derivation of each force will be discussed in sections [ sec : c0 ] and [ sec : p0mu ] . as shown in figure ( [ fig : onsager ] ) , we sum the effects of three driving forces for each cross - section averaged flux term and write a set of quasi - linear equations as follows :    @xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8    the pre - factors @xmath9 are area - averaged coefficients , which can be computed from the solution of the poisson - boltzmann equation across each pore cross - section .",
    "as will be discussed in section [ sec : area integrated transport ] , in our modeling we assume that for each pore the area - averaged charge is equal to that on the solid walls ( total cross - section is electroneutral ) .",
    "this allows tracking of only one ion in a binary electrolyte system ; the area - averaged concentration of the other ion can be computed from the electroneutrality condition .",
    "we can rewrite equations ( [ eq:1u])-([eq:1j ] ) in a matrix form and develop a right hand side coefficient matrix as follows : @xmath10 = \\begin{bmatrix } \\bar{g}_{11 } & \\bar{g}_{12 } & \\bar{g}_{13}\\\\              \\bar{g}_{21 } & \\bar{g}_{22 } & \\bar{g}_{23}\\\\              \\bar{g}_{31 } & \\bar{g}_{32 } & \\bar{g}_{33}\\end{bmatrix } \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\nabla p_0 \\\\ \\nabla \\mu^+ \\\\",
    "\\nabla c_0 \\end{array } \\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : onsager}\\ ] ]    for the sets of driving potentials and fluxes employed here , the coefficient matrix , @xmath9 satisfies the onsager symmetry , a property derived based on the assumption of the reversibility of microscopic equations of motions @xcite .",
    "the property of linear response of the fluxes to the gradient of driving potentials , which will be derived in detail below , has been utilized and discussed widely in electro - chemistry literature @xcite .",
    "one should note that equation ( [ eq : onsager ] ) is only valid for local gradients at each axial position along the pore .",
    "in general it does not hold for large distances due to the nonlinear response of the system given @xmath9 is a function of dynamically evolving fields with time . for each axial position , the determinant of the corresponding matrix is always positive .",
    "in other words , the coefficient matrix is positive definite , which verifies that the developed model satisfies the second law of thermodynamics @xcite stating that the global entropy increases during an irreversible process . + despite the useful insights obtained from the previous reduced order models which have similar forms to equation ( [ eq : onsager ] ) , they suffer from several limitations , which make them unsuitable for computational implementation and analysis of complex pore networks .",
    "many of these models have been developed at steady state @xcite , or in the limit of thin edl @xcite .",
    "many are geometry dependent and are applicable only to simple network topologies @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we have derived a new reduced order transport model accompanied with a novel computational discretization that offers several advantages for computational modeling of porous networks :    1 .",
    "the developed reduced order model covers the entire range of edl to pore size ratios .",
    "large pores and high concentrations lead to thin edl limit , and small pores and low concentration result in highly overlapped edls .",
    "furthermore , the developed model includes an asymptotic treatment for the limit of zero concentration ( infinite edl thickness ) .",
    "this entire regime is relevant to electrokinetic transport in porous systems since deionization shocks often result in a wide range of variations in ion concentration .",
    "the matrix coefficients in the developed model are bounded over the entire range of concentrations and pore sizes .",
    "the formulation setup in the developed model uses driving potentials that remain bounded in the limit of very small ( and large ) concentration .",
    "the discretization scheme is fully conservative without any numerical leakage of ion concentrations .",
    "we should note that the variables that form the driving potentials ( e.g. virtual concentration ) are not conservative by nature .",
    "however other field variables , such as area - averaged concentration , are physically conserved . to maintain all of the advantages described above , our formulation uses evolution equations for conservative fields as primary unknowns ;",
    "the driving potentials are closed in terms of conservative quantities through solutions to the poisson - boltzmann equation .",
    "our formulation is discretely well balanced . in other words , in the absence of any driving force , equilibrium solution is recovered regardless of spatial mesh spacing .",
    "this property has been achieved by utilizing virtual quantities as driving potentials since they are invariants of thermodynamic equilibrium states .",
    "the derived methodology is capable of handling discrete jumps in pore size , or multi - pore intersections .",
    "handling such configurations is challenging since pressure , concentration , and electrostatic potential can discretely jump across such interfaces .",
    "however , the virtual potentials remain continuous , and this property has been utilized in the present model .    the outline of the paper can be summarized as follows : we begin by describing the model problem and the governing equations .",
    "after nondimensionalizing the equations , we introduce main assumptions of the model and motivate deriving reduced order models for thin and long pores .",
    "then , we present the derivation of model reduction in which the thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed in thin directions to pre - specify the field profiles in cross - sectional directions .",
    "we then introduce the 1d model governing the axial transport of ions at each pore and provide a comprehensive discussion of different flux terms .",
    "we explain the coupling of solutions for different pores by proper application of conservation laws at pore intersections . in the result section",
    ", we first present the results obtained by using tabulated coefficients to investigate the influence of pore size and surface charge on the osmotic phenomenon in a single pore .",
    "we then demonstrate our model validation by comparing our results with those from direct numerical simulations of two pore systems : ( 1 ) a single micropore confined by a cation - selective membrane , and ( 2 ) a microchannel - nanochannel - microchannel setting exposed to an external pressure gradient .",
    "we also discuss the temporal and spatial evolution of electrokinetic behaviors emerging in networks of micro - pores and nano - pores in series , parallel , and h - junction configurations .",
    "we model an electrokinetic porous structure as a network of micro - scale and nano - scale pores with small aspect ratio ; that is they are assumed to be long and thin pores .",
    "figure ( [ fig : pore_coord ] ) shows an example of a porous network . for each pore",
    ", the x - axis is assigned in the axial direction .",
    "each pore can have a general area cross - section ( @xmath11 ) , and the area and the surface charge density ( @xmath12 ) can vary smoothly in the pore longitudinal direction . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the surface charge density is fixed in time and the pore is filled with a symmetric binary electrolyte with diffusivity d and valence z. however , extension of the model to time - variable surface charge , such as in conducting material or in systems with surface reaction , and inclusion of multi - species is straightforward . as will be explained in detail , pores may lead to terminal reservoirs , where the salt concentration is known , or be connected together via intersections that are modeled as `` internal reservoirs '' whose concentration is to be dynamically determined .",
    "the pore surface charge is screened by counterions through the electric double layer ( edl ) , denoted by @xmath13 in figure ( [ fig : pore_coord ] ) .",
    "we have employed coupled poisson - nerst - planck - stokes equations for the mathematical modeling of the ion transport through the pore systems .",
    "below we use the symbol `` @xmath14 '' to denote dimensional field variables including space , time , and vector and scalar fields .",
    "all constants regardless of their dimensionality and dimensionless field variables are denoted without @xmath14 .",
    "the evolution of ion concentration fields is represented by transport equations utilizing the nernst - planck flux form : @xmath15 where @xmath16 are concentrations for positive and negative ions and @xmath17 is the velocity field vector .",
    "the parameters @xmath18 , z , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 refer to ion diffusivity , ion valence , elementary charge , boltzmann constant , and absolute temperature , respectively . here",
    "we have employed einstein s relation to write the ion electromigration mobility in terms of its diffusivity .",
    "we consider zero ion flux normal to the pore surfaces : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the velocity component normal to walls and @xmath24 is the dimensional gradient operator in wall - normal directions .",
    "+ the electric potential field , @xmath25 is governed by the poisson equation : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the @xmath28 of the solution and @xmath29 is the local charge density equal to : @xmath30 using gauss s law , we write the boundary condition for the electric field on the pore wall as follows : @xmath31 where @xmath12 is the known surface charge density and assumed to be constant in time and distributed uniformly over the pore perimeter at all axial positions , but it can vary along the pore axis .",
    "we consider an incompressible fluid flow at low reynolds number regime governed by the stokes equations : @xmath32      where @xmath34 is the fluid dynamic viscosity , and @xmath35 represents the hydrodynamic pressure in the domain .",
    "for all velocity components , no - slip and no - penetration conditions are imposed at pore walls .",
    "we will discuss the boundary treatment in the axial directions in section [ sec : network ] .",
    "we combine three solutions that are obtained for these cases to find the concentration correction ( @xmath36 ) throughout the network : @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the solutions obtained for case 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "the boundary values , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , are obtained by enforcing equation ( [ eq : itr_transport ] ) for internal reservoir . for terminal reservoirs",
    "whose concentration values are known , we impose @xmath41 . after solving for concentration correction in the reservoirs ,",
    "we compute this variable throughout the network using equation ( [ eq : delta_c ] ) and the new concentration field is obtained by @xmath42 .",
    "this procedure is applied iteratively until @xmath43 , which implies that @xmath44 .",
    "we run our simulation with three iterations to ensure that the method is second order accurate and the solution is sufficiently robust ."
