    "in the absence of flavor symmetries , the yukawa couplings between the standard model ( sm ) fermions and the higgs field are in general complex arbitrary matrices which , after electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , become the mass matrices of the quarks and charged leptons . in the case of neutrinos",
    ", the mass matrix will be in general complex symmetric .",
    "all these matrices contain more parameters than physical observables and an explicit computation of these observables ( fermion masses and mixings ) in terms of the original matrix elements can be quite cumbersome in general . indeed this would require us to solve a @xmath2 eigenvalue problem for each fermion matrix , and then compose the unitary transformations ( formed with the calculated eigenvectors ) of the up and down quark sectors and then also of the charged lepton and neutrino sectors .",
    "we observe however that it may be useful to address the question not as an eigenvalue problem , but as an eigenvector problem , treating the eigenvalues as input parameters and not as output .",
    "the first reason for this is that except for the neutrino sector , all the mass eigenvalues are quite well known .",
    "but the main point we make is that by keeping explicitly the mass eigenvalues as input parameters , the eigenvector solutions of each mass matrix become surprisingly simple and can be written as compact functions of both the mass matrix elements and the eigenvalues ( the fermion masses ) .",
    "such a parametrization of the mixing matrices , directly in terms of the original mass parameters and the fermion masses might prove to be useful in the studies aiming to explain the observed flavor structure of the sm by way of symmetries or textures or patterns @xcite at the level of the fermion mass matrices .",
    "it is true , though , that to proceed we need to work with hermitian matrices , but it is always possible to render the quark mass matrices hermitian in the standard model without loss of generality @xcite .",
    "the procedure to obtain hermitian matrices is quite standard , and it involves either working with the hermitian matrix @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the original fermion mass matrix , or using its polar decomposition , i.e. solving @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a unitary matrix converting the general complex matrix @xmath4 into a positive semi - definite hermitian matrix @xmath7 ( if @xmath4 is invertible , with distinct non - vanishing eigenvalues , then @xmath7 is positive definite and therefore @xmath6 is unique ) .",
    "we will first present our parametrization ( in fact 9 different types ) for the unitary matrix @xmath8 which diagonalizes a general hermitian matrix @xmath1 in the most compact way possible . then , to start taking advantage of it , we then propose a simple and mildly constraining ansatz for the flavor structure of the sm fermion sector .",
    "it assumes that the unitary transformations diagonalizing @xmath9 and @xmath10 can each be decomposed as only two rotations , instead of three .",
    "the idea is to assume that the third rotation angle is zero ( or much smaller than the other two ) and therefore one of the entries of each transformation matrix @xmath11 and @xmath12 will be zero or close to zero .",
    "we call this setup the two - angle ansatz and we will concentrate in only one of the many possible cases .",
    "our parametrization allows us to quickly obtain very simple dependences of the fermion mixing matrices @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite in terms of the masses and the original mass matrix elements .",
    "we can thus study easily the interesting properties of this type of ansatz as well as the consequences it has in the original mass matrices , in both the quark and the lepton sectors .",
    "a particularly interesting observation is that the specific value of some elements of @xmath9 and @xmath10 has no effect ( or very mild effect ) on the observed values of masses and mixings .",
    "as explained before , we are going to concentrate on hermitian matrices with the assumption that the fermion mass matrices are either hermitian or that one can construct a hermitian matrix out of them .",
    "all the results presented in this work are valid for general hermitian matrices , but for simplicity we will only consider the case of positive definite hermitian matrices .",
    "let @xmath1 be one such matrix : @xmath15 with eigenvalues @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "a compact parametrization of the unitary matrix @xmath8 which diagonalizes it , is or @xmath18 ) is explicitly absent in each vector column ( see appendix a for details ) . in the parametrization shown here ,",
    "the rotation matrix @xmath8 has the correct limit when the off - diagonal entries in the original mass matrices @xmath1 are set to zero , avoiding ( apparent ) divergences in this limit . ]",

    "these equations are found from the three invariants @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 : @xmath26 by choosing @xmath27 as an independent variable , it is possible to rewrite these constraint relations on the rest of variables as or @xmath28 as the independent variable . ]",
    "@xmath29 the interesting thing of this notation is that the constraint formulae on @xmath30 and @xmath28 actually become algebraic solutions for both @xmath30 and @xmath28 when the term @xmath31 vanishes identically . in particular",
    ", this is the case when one deals with mass matrices with texture zeroes in the off - diagonal elements .",
    "equipped with an exact and simple parametrization of the fermion mixing matrix in both up and down sectors ( or charged lepton and neutrino sectors ) , we look for economical patterns among the mixing matrices by following a bottom - up approach in the hope that it might be complementary to more top - down approaches such as imposing flavor symmetries or texture zeroes mass matrices ( see @xcite as well as the probably incomplete surveys of @xcite ) .",
    "one avenue is to find a similar ansatz for the flavor structure of the mixing matrices in both quark and leptonic sectors .",
    "such possibility exists in the sense that in both sectors , the mixing elements @xmath32 and @xmath33 are known to be small .",
    "this feature is very interesting and it is known to lead to a simple parametrization of the mixing matrix . note that in the limit @xmath34 we have two additional conditions , since @xmath35 is a complex number .",
    "this means that in this limit , the mixing matrix will have only two independent parameters instead of four .",
    "we can choose these four independent parameters to be @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xcite . in the limit of @xmath34 , we have the extra constraint @xmath40 .",
    "this means that the whole mixing matrix is described by @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "note also that in this limit , there is no @xmath41 violation  la dirac in both quark and leptonic sectors .    in what follows",
    ", the subscript @xmath42 stands for the values of the mixing matrix elements in the limit @xmath34 .",
    "since @xmath35 is known to be very small , we believe that the zeroes values of the mixing matrix elements are not far from their measured values . for the quarks",
    ", we have : @xmath43 note that this zero - order @xmath44 can be decomposed as a product of two rotations , namely one is purely the cabbibo angle and the other one is purely made out of beauty namely @xmath45 : @xmath46 with @xmath47 in the leptonic sector we have : @xmath48 which can be decomposed also as a product of two rotations , namely one is purely solar and the other one is purely atmospheric : @xmath49 with , @xmath50 the diagonal phase matrix @xmath51 which contains the majorana phases is defined as : @xmath52 this structure for the physical fermion mixing matrices , decomposed mainly into just two rotations is quite suggestive and we will use this observation as the starting point of our analysis . in this context",
    "we ask ourselves how many economical possibilities one has to restore minimally and fully the mixing elements and @xmath41 violation .",
    "we start with the structure @xmath53 and then to be as general as possible while still keeping the original motivation we consider all mixing patterns emerging from the original structure , but with only one zero in each mixing matrix .",
    "now , we establish all the corrected mixing patterns for both up and down quark sectors : @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 stands for a non - zero value and @xmath57 for a corrected originally zero mixing matrix element .",
    "these mixing matrices with one texture zero in them can be decomposed themselves into only two rotations instead of three .",
    "we call this the two - angle ansatz , in which both the up and down quark sectors are diagonalized by unitary transformations containing just two angles ( i.e. having one vanishing element ) .",
    "there are obviously many possibilities for this ansatz but in particular there are 16 cases such that one can recover in a specific limit the case @xmath34 . in this work",
    "we are going to focus only on one specific example of this type of ansatz , although a full case by case study is underway .",
    "we feel that the main features of this ansatz do reveal themselves in the example studied here , and we prefer to continue elsewhere a more systematic exploration . +",

    "of course , we have more than enough free parameters to fit the two remaining observables , but as we will shortly see , of the 4 free phases , only two phase differences can be relevant , and the 2 real parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 turn out to be statistically irrelevant if the two phases are properly chosen . in other words , in most of the parameter space of the six free parameters needed to produce the two remaining physical observables , 4 directions are more or less irrelevant , with two phase differences being the two parameters required to obtain a good experimental fit .",

    "these two values of @xmath200 and @xmath201 are consistent with the tri - bimaximal scheme @xmath178 where @xmath202 and so we find that in the lepton case the preferred value of the phase combination @xmath203 is @xmath204 , which statistically predicts a large value for both the mixing angles @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the charged fermion mass matrix must have the same structure as the up and down quark mass matrices , namely that the first diagonal element is of the order of the lightest eigenvalue .    since the mixing element @xmath207 is not small",
    ", we also conclude that the neutrino mass structure must be different from the other three matrices",
    ". this could be due to the fact that the eigenvalues are not as hierarchical as for the charged fermions .",
    "as in the quark case , it is interesting to note that further imposing some flavor symmetry might simplify the relations obtained in this ansatz . in particular one could ask what is the effect of imposing the @xmath146 family symmetry ( see for example @xcite ) only in the neutrino sector . in our case",
    "this is a natural question to ask since this symmetry imposes automatically the element @xmath208 to be zero , which is the defining condition of our ansatz .",
    "but it also imposes the following constraints on the mass matrix elements ( h_)_12=(h_)_13 ,   & i.e. &   y=h + ( h_)_22=(h_)_33 ,  & i.e. &   =d + = ,   & i.e. &   _ f=this will have interesting consequences on the lepton mixing matrix because in this case we will have v_3  =  c&= &  +  o(m_e / m _ ) where we have assumed that @xmath209 .",
    "now one can see that when @xmath210 , independent of anything else , we will have @xmath211 , as well as @xmath212 .",
    "thus the @xmath213 symmetry , along with the requirement of the phase of @xmath214 to be @xmath158 , forces the appearance of large mixing angle in the @xmath14 matrix , and we remind the reader that we are not considering a diagonal charged lepton mass matrix , although all our matrices are taken in the @xmath88 ansatz .",
    "the form of the @xmath14 matrix under these assumptions is v__pmns=  p_where as before , @xmath215 and @xmath216 and where @xmath167 is the dirac cp phase given by @xmath217 and the majorana phase matrix @xmath162 is given by p_= the phase @xmath218 is given by @xmath219 .    finally , in the more general case where one does not consider @xmath146 symmetry in the neutrino sector , the leptonic jarlskog invariant @xmath138 is computed to be : j&= &    & = & |v_e3||v_1|c_ c_ .",
    "for the preferred value of @xmath191 , such that statistically it is more favorable to obtain a @xmath175 mixing angle close to @xmath220 , we obtain j&= & |v_e3||v_1|c_ c_ .",
    "this suggests that now , the value @xmath221 will maximize the possible value of @xmath138 ( normalized to @xmath188 ) , and this is confirmed in the random scan shown in figure [ vtau3delta ] .",
    "in this work , we started by obtaining the simplest parametrization for the diagonalization of a @xmath222 hermitian matrix , as a function of both its matrix elements and its eigenvalues .",
    "since the masses of fermions in the sm are well known , the problem to attack is not an eigenvalue problem , but an eigenvector problem . in other words",
    ", we are able to obtain the eigenvectors of a hermitian matrix in an algebraically compact form because we treated the eigenvalues as known parameters , instead of unknown . with this parametrization in hand",
    ", we wanted then to show how it could simplify and make quite transparent the analysis and study of some flavor schemes .",
    "to this end we defined a new flavor scheme which imposes some ( arguably obscure ) constraints on the flavor structure in the fermion sector .",
    "the constraint imposed is the requirement of the vanishing of one of the mixing angles of the diagonalization matrix of each hermitian fermion mass matrix of the sm .",
    "we called this the `` two - angle '' ansatz ( i.e. out of three angles to diagonalize a hermitian matrix , we consider the family of hermitian matrices diagonalized by only two angles ) , and it is bottom - up motivated , i.e. it is inspired on the observed structure of both @xmath13 and @xmath14 matrices .",
    "nevertheless we also observe that in flavor models where one requires a full symmetry between two of the three families , like the @xmath223 symmetry models , one of the consequences is precisely the vanishing of one of the mixing angles .",
    "but we mainly decided to keep the bottom - up approach motivation and study the patterns emerging from our `` two - angle '' ansatz and focused on just one possible implementation , the @xmath88 case , in which the @xmath224 entries of all the diagonalizing matrices happen to vanish . using our parametrization , one can actually write both @xmath13 and @xmath14 in terms of the original matrix elements and eigenvalues .",
    "in particular we found a peculiar dependence of one of the mixing angles with the model parameters .",
    "we observed that by fixing the phase difference @xmath94 between two parameters of the up and down mass matrices ( or the neutrino and charged lepton mass matrices ) , the mixing angle @xmath104 ( or @xmath175 ) can be `` predicted '' in a statistical sense , i.e. if one makes a random scan allowing the remaining free parameters to take any possible value , including the eigenvalues , one obtains a narrow distribution for the value of @xmath89 ( or @xmath194 ) , and the central value is a monotonic function of the phase difference @xmath94 .",
    "this can be seen by rewriting the general formula for @xmath104 in the @xmath88 ansatz ( see eq .",
    "( [ ceq ] ) ) as    @xmath225 , @xmath226 and @xmath227 , and @xmath228 and @xmath229 are diagonal elements of the up and down mass matrices respectively . if the mass eigenvalues @xmath230 are unconstrained , the only constraints on the parameters required for a random scan are ^u_1/^u_3  <  ,  <  1 & and & ^d_1/^d_3  <  ,  <  1 since the diagonal elements of a hermitian matrix must be bounded by its largest and lowest eigenvalues .",
    "the result of a scan over all these parameters ( including the eigenvalues ) but for fixed @xmath231 is a highly peaked distribution centered at some value .",
    "this means that the generic value of @xmath89 is controlled almost exclusively by @xmath94 .",
    "of course one may think that after fixing the masses to the experimental values , as well as the other mixing angles , maybe we might loose this statistical prediction .",
    "this is not the case as was shown in figure [ vtbdelta ] , where the scan is performed now with only two free parameters , the rest having been fixed by other experimental observables .",
    "there is still a clear correlation between the value of the phase difference and the value of the angle @xmath104 .",
    "the imposition of this specific two - angle ansatz ( the ( @xmath232 ) case ) on the fermion mass matrices amounts to 2 constraints per mass matrix , and therefore 4 constraints in the quark sector .",
    "what we have noted is that with only one more constraint , i.e. the fixing of the phase difference @xmath94 , we are able to give a statistical prediction for the value of the angle @xmath89 ( or @xmath194 ) , and this , irrespective of any other parameter . in particular if @xmath98 we would expect @xmath233 and in the lepton sector , if we fix @xmath191 , then we would expect @xmath234 , both cases being close to the experimental fits .",
    "two hermitian matrices contain 18 free parameters altogether and so it is nontrivial that after imposing only 5 constraints on the whole set we obtain one prediction , irrespective of anything else .",
    "once noted this nontrivial property , we continued analyzing the rest of consequences of our scheme and showed for example how the cp violating phases in both quark and lepton sectors depend on the phases of the original mass matrix elements .",
    "another interesting outcome was the realization of how to treat in a similar way the quarks and charged lepton mass matrices , and use the special case of the neutrino matrix to explain in a transparent way the observed differences between the lepton and quark sectors . in particular we also analyzed the consequences of further imposing a @xmath146 symmetry in the neutrino sector .",
    "it is true that out of many possible implementations of the two - angle ansatz we chose to study only one case .",
    "we felt that this one case would show the main features of the scheme in a transparent way , and so we leave the systematic case by case study of the scenario for the future , although part of this work is already underway .",
    "m.t . would like to thank alex azatov , joseph schechter and lijun zhu for useful discussions .",

    "the bounds are 0<_1  _ 3 + 0<_1  _ 3 + 0<_1  a  _ 3 the off - diagonal entries of @xmath1 are also bounded by its smallest and largest eigenvalues in the following way ; since a @xmath222 hermitian matrix has only three blocks of off - diagonal elements , namely @xmath237 , @xmath238 and @xmath239 up to conjugation @xcite : 0  |_3-_1| + 0  |_3-_1| + 0  |_3-_1| which means that : 0 |x|  |_3-_1| + 0 |g|  |_3-_1| + 0 |b|  |_3-_1| the above results are valid for any @xmath240 hermitian matrix .",
    "these bounds might not be very revealing in the quark and charged lepton sectors , since the difference between the heaviest and the lightest eigenvalues is of the order of the largest eigenvalue , and so the constraint on the off - diagonal entries is quite mild . on the other hand ,",
    "if the difference between the heaviest and lightest eigenvalue is very small then one sees that the off - diagonal entries must actually be smaller than half that difference , and so the hermitian matrix must be close to diagonal form",
    ". this case might be possible in the neutrino sector in the case of quasi - degenerate masses .",
    "we now write the three invariants @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 : @xmath26 they can be rewritten as latexmath:[\\ ] ] of course depending on the specific scenario studied , some other parametrization might be used .",

    "( [ e1row ] ) , ( [ e2row ] ) and ( [ e3row ] ) . of course , when one takes some special limits some of the parametrizations will reveal themselves less useful , as it is possible to find undetermined expressions of the type @xmath272 .",
    "for example in the parametrization shown in eq .",
    "( [ e2rowpar ] ) this will happen if we take simultaneously the limits @xmath273 and @xmath274 .",

    "the requirement for the cancellation of these elements is @xmath284 and @xmath285 , and with them we obtain in both sectors the simpler identities : @xmath286 from the above expressions we obtain the following simple parametrization of up and down quark mixing matrices , with @xmath66 , @xmath67 : @xmath287 and @xmath288 one can now check that in this ansatz , which basically shows that the structure of the quark mixing matrix is v__ckm= where @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are given by c&= &  v_tb + s&=&e^i _ b + c_&= & + c_&= & and @xmath79 and @xmath80 . the previous form for @xmath13",
