    "kaon photoproduction on light nuclei provides invaluable information on the strangeness dynamics in the realm of elementary particles and nuclear matters .",
    "reactions on the proton , i.e. , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , have been intensively investigated  @xcite , since experimental data are available mostly in these channels  @xcite . since there is no free neutron target available , one can use deuteron as an effective neutron target . by choosing deuteron as a target",
    ", some rescattering effects might appear in the final state of the reaction  @xcite .",
    "these effects introduce some complications in the reaction .",
    "nevertheless , one can look for some appropriate kinematical regions to reduce these effects  @xcite .",
    "recently , an experiment of neutral kaon photoproduction on the deuterium has been performed at the laboratory of nuclear science ( lns ) , in sendai  @xcite . in this experiment",
    "the cross section of the inclusive process @xmath4 at photon energies around reaction threshold with forward kaon angles have been measured . in the previous work",
    "@xcite , comparison between experimental data and theoretical calculation by using elementary operator of kaon - maid @xcite have been made and it is shown that the model overpredicts the data , especially in the @xmath5 channel .",
    "a fair agreement with the data could be achieved when the coupling of @xmath6 vertex in that channel were set equal to zero . however",
    ", such treatment might disturb the cross section in the other channels , e.g. , the @xmath3 channel , which also contains the @xmath6 vertex .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to reinvestigate kaon photoproduction on the nucleon and deuteron by fitting the model to the new experimental data on the elementary reaction only , as well as simultaneously to the deuteron data from lns .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . the formalism for calculating the transition matrix and observables",
    "are shown in sect .",
    "[ formulation ] .",
    "the results and comparisons with experimental data are presented in sect .",
    "[ result ] .",
    "we close this paper with a conclusion in sect .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "in this work we use the isobar model for the elementary operator which includes some important resonance terms besides the born terms .",
    "while this leads to violation of unitarity , this kind of isobar model provides a simple tool to parametrize kaon photoproduction on the nucleon because it is relatively easy to calculate and to use for production on nuclei . in this approach",
    ", the photoproduction amplitude can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 s are invariant amplitudes as functions of the mandelstam variables only .",
    "the hyperon and nucleon dirac spinors are denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively . the invariant dirac operators @xmath11 , which are given by @xmath12\\ , , \\\\",
    "\\gamma^{3}_{\\lambda }   & = & \\gamma_{5 } \\left ( q\\cdot k { \\epsilon{\\!\\!/}}\\!_{\\lambda } - q \\cdot \\epsilon_{\\lambda } k { \\!\\!\\!/}\\right)\\ , , \\\\ \\gamma^{4}_{\\lambda }   & = & i \\epsilon_{\\mu \\nu \\rho \\sigma } \\gamma^{\\mu } q^{\\nu } \\epsilon^{\\rho}_{\\lambda } k^{\\sigma}\\ , , \\label{eq - gnky - gamma - matrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are gauge lorentz invariant pseudoscalars and given in terms of the usual @xmath13-matrices , the photon momentum @xmath14 , and its polarization vector @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 labels the polarization states , @xmath17 the meson momentum , and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote initial and final baryon momenta , respectively .",
    "the rather lengthy expression of @xmath8 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we apply the impulse approximation for kaon photoproduction on the deuteron ( fig .",
    "[ reaction ] ) . through out the paper we work in the deuteron rest frame . for the inclusive process @xmath4 the cross section",
    "is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 with @xmath23 is the momentum transfer and @xmath24 is the hyperon momentum calculated in the center of mass frame of the two final baryons . for the radial part of the deuteron wave function @xmath25 we use the nijmegen models  @xcite",
    "fitting to the experimental data has been done in two ways .",
    "first we fit the model to some new data of elementary reactions only  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ dk0sp_el ] shows the differential cross section for @xmath26 channel after this fitting procedure . in this paper",
    "we only show this channel due to the lack of space . from this figure it seems to us that the new model provide an important improvement to the kaon - maid especially at higher energies and forward angles .",
    "the extracted parameters obtained from this fitting is then used to calculate the inclusive cross section of the @xmath27 process , as shown by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ deuteron_new ] .",
    "obviously , the model still overpredicts the experimental data .",
    "then , we fit the parameters in the model to all data , including the deuteron ones . in this case",
    "we introduce a weighting factor @xmath28 in the fitting procedure to emphasize the importance of the deuteron data .",
    "explicitly , we use @xmath29 , in order to get a better agreement between our fit and deuteron data . the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ deuteron_new ] , where it is clear that the weighting factor leads to a significant improvement of the model .",
    "figure  [ dif_3db ] shows the calculated differential cross section for the @xmath5 channel as functions of the total c.m .",
    "energy and kaon scattering angle .",
    "the left panel in this figure is obtained from fitting to all data , the middle panel is the prediction by using the parameter values from fitting to the data of elementary reaction only , and the right panel is kaon - maid result . obviously , fittings to the new data do not indicate a backward peaking features in the angular distribution of @xmath5 channel .",
    "a more detailed result of our calculation will be published soon @xcite .",
    "we have investigated kaon photoproduction of the nucleon and deuteron .",
    "the parameters obtained from fitting to the new elementary reaction data only still leads to an overprediction of the inclusive reaction cross section on deuteron . more experimental data of kaon photoproduction on the deuteron are needed in order to get a better understanding of kaon photoproduction process as well as to avoid the weighting factor used in the fitting procedure .",
    "there is no indication of the backward peaking feature in the angular distribution of @xmath5 channel obtained in the present work .",
