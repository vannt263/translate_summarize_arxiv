    "both non - relativistic and relativistic phenomenological nuclear models are nowadays used to describe successfully nuclear matter and finite nuclei within a density functional formalism .",
    "one of the most commonly used non - relativistic models , the skyrme force model , has been extensively used in the literature since the work of vautherin and brink @xcite .",
    "the skyrme effective interaction has been improved since its first version @xcite in order to account for the different properties of nuclei , not only along the stability line , but also for exotic nuclei from the proton to the neutron drip line and to yield a good description of neutron stars @xcite . along this line , many different versions of the skyrme effective force have been developed and tested and the importance of the asymmetry discussed @xcite . in @xcite , the results of the variational microscopic calculations , in which many - body and some relativistic corrections were included , were parametrized . in @xcite",
    "the skyrme model parameters were chosen so as to fit the eos given in @xcite . in @xcite 87",
    "different parametrizations , which give similar results for finite nuclei experimental observables , were checked against neutron star properties and 60 of them were ruled out .",
    "some of the non - relativistic models include also a three - body force @xcite in order to solve the causality problem , reproduce saturation properties of nuclear matter and improve the description of the symmetry energy .",
    "relativistic models , on the other hand , are advantageous if high density matter , such as the one existing in compact stars , is described , and in particular no lack of causality arises as density increases . as seen in @xcite ,",
    "neutron star properties depend on the correct choice of the equation of state ( eos ) and the same problem appears within relativistic models , which can be parametrized in different ways , all of them giving similar results for finite nuclei and nuclear matter or neutron matter .",
    "once the eos is extrapolated to high densities , quantities as symmetry energy , for example , depend a lot on the parameter set chosen @xcite . at subsaturation densities , there is an unstable region , which varies a lot and present different behaviors according to the parametrization chosen @xcite .",
    "some relativistic models introduce the density dependence through the couplings of baryons to mesons @xcite and once again the instability region at low densities and the eos at high densities are sensible to the model considered @xcite .",
    "we point out that the saturation mechanism of relativistic and non - relativistic models is different . for the first ones saturation",
    "is attained due to the relativistic quenching of the scalar field . on the other hand ,",
    "non - relativistic models have to introduce three - body repulsive interactions in order to describe saturation correctly .    at very low densities both ,",
    "the relativistic and the non - relativistic approaches predict a liquid - gas phase transition region for nuclear matter leading , for dense star matter to a non - homogeneous phase commonly named _ pasta phase _ , formed by a competition between the long - range coulomb repulsion and the short - range nuclear attraction @xcite .",
    "in the past some attempts have already been made in order to compare nuclear matter and finite nuclei properties obtained both with relativistic and non - relativistic models @xcite but there is no clear or obvious explanations for the differences . in the following we compare the skyrme effective force with relativistic nuclear mean - field models at subsaturation densities with the goal to directly compare the energy functional .",
    "we expect that the same physics should be contained in both approaches at these densities and therefore it maybe fruitful to compare both types of models in this range of densities .",
    "we start with a brief review of the skyrme parametrizations of the nuclear energy density functional .",
    "next we consider relativistic mean - field models with constant couplings , namely the initially proposed parametrizations including only linear terms for the meson contributions @xcite and parametrizations with non - linear terms @xcite .",
    "then we extend our investigation to density dependent models @xcite .",
    "we compare the non - relativistic limit of their binding energies with the binding energy functional obtained with the non - relativistic skyrme model .",
    "various levels of the approximation are then discussed .",
    "the non relativistic skyrme energy functional is defined by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the kinetic - energy density , @xmath2 a density - independent two - body term , @xmath3 a density - dependent term , and @xmath4 a momentum - dependent term : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the total baryonic density , @xmath7 and @xmath8 being the proton and the neutron densities respectively , @xmath9 , the isovector density , @xmath10 , the total kinetic density , @xmath11 being the kinetic density of each type of particles @xmath12 with a fermi momentum @xmath13 , and @xmath14 the isovector kinetic term .",
    "we introduce the following quantities : @xmath15 the symmetric matter potential energy , @xmath16 the potential part of the symmetry energy and @xmath17 the proton @xmath18 or neutron @xmath19 effective masses , @xmath20 such that @xmath21    the coefficients @xmath22 and @xmath23 , associated respectively with the symmetry and asymmetry contributions , are linear combinations of the traditional skyrme parameters : @xmath24/16 \\\\ d_{\\rm eff } & = \\ \\ [ t_{2}(2x_{2}+1)-t_{1}(2x_{1}+1)]/16 \\end{array}\\ ] ] and @xmath25 parametrizes the density dependent term . the @xmath25 exponent has a direct effect on the incompressibility .",
    "a decrease in @xmath25 generates a lower value for the incompressibility @xcite . using @xmath26 the kinetic terms",
    "can be directly related to the respective density @xmath27 where we have introduced @xmath28 .",
    "looking at small asymmetries @xmath29 we get      then it is easy to decompose the kinetic energy density @xmath31 into a symmetric matter component and a symmetry kinetic energy @xmath32 leading to @xmath33\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the isoscalar part of the effective mass @xmath34 directly contributes to @xmath35 but also contributes to the symmetry energy because of the asymmetry in the fermi energy .",
    "indeed as in the fermi gas model the two first terms of @xmath36 can be recasted as @xmath37 the last term is an additional term coming from the isovector part of the effective mass .",
    "these various contributions to the kinetic energy play an important role both in the binding energy and saturation properties of symmetric matter and in the isospin dependence usually discussed in terms of symmetry energy .",
    "when comparing with relativistic approaches the discussion of the kinetic part becomes even more important since the role played by the effective mass and interaction are known to be in general rather different . in table",
    "[ tab : properties ] we present the nuclear matter saturation properties obtained with the skyrme forces used in the present work .",
    "we consider a conventional skyrme interaction siii , one of the recent skyrme - lyon interactions designed to describe neutron - rich matter sly230a @xcite , the nrapr parametrization which stands for the skyrme interaction parameters obtained from a fitting to the eos of a microscopic model @xcite and the lns parametrization which refers to a recently skyrme - like parametrization proposed in the framework of the brueckner - hartree - fock approximation for nuclear matter @xcite ."
