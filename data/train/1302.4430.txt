    "photosynthetic complexes are sophisticated light - harvesting machinery consisting of antenna molecules .",
    "the energy absorbed by the antenna molecules , so - called exciton , is transferred to many intermediate molecules and eventually arrives at a reaction center ( rc ) where the process of biochemical energy conversion is initiated .",
    "recent work has reported that quantum theory governs the exciton transfer in some light - harvesting complexes that harness the absorbed energy with almost 100% efficiency  @xcite@xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that the interplay of quantum walk and noisy environment provides the high light - harvesting efficiency in these complexes  @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , the underlying mechanism of noise - assisted enhancement has remained elusive and the role of structural characteristics of antenna complexes is still not clear .",
    "first , photosynthetic complexes possess energy - level mismatches between antenna molecules .",
    "as energy - level mismatches are likely to cause anderson localization  @xcite and to inhibit the transfer of excitation  @xcite , it is desired to understand why photosynthetic complexes evolve by maintaining such energy - level mismatches instead of eliminating or reducing if impossible .",
    "second , the noise - assisted enhancement is not possible in certain situations , such as uniform linear chains with no energy - level mismatches  @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that energy - level mismatches are related to the condition for the enhancement  @xcite , but their fundamental role is still not unraveled .",
    "moreover , even in the cases where the noise - assisted enhancement is possible , the underlying principle of enhancement remains ambiguous due to the lack of basic studies based on quantum interference  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the role of energy - level mismatches in a multi - pathway complex where multiple sub - complexes are independently connected to the rc via a receiver molecule ( see ) . for a single - pathway complex ,",
    "we show that any energy - level mismatches suppress the efficiency of exciton transfer as expected by anderson localization . in the absence of energy - level mismatches , we show that quantum noise of dephasing , which decreases the quantum coherence of excitation , will never help the transfer efficiency . for a bi - pathway complex , on the other hand",
    ", we demonstrate that the absence of energy - level mismatches leads to undesired destructive interference at the receiver molecule .",
    "the destructive interference is caused by the two types of probability amplitudes , one of coming from one pathway and the other of going to and returning from the other pathway .",
    "it blocks exciton transfer to the rc so that the transfer efficiency is less than @xmath0 and relaxation of the sub - complexes to the ground state becomes very slow .",
    "we show that energy - level mismatches play a dominant role in suppressing the undesired interference .",
    "then , the presence of energy - level mismatches enhances the transfer efficiency even though the resultant localization effect suppresses the energy transfer in each pathway of the complex .",
    "due to the competition between the anderson localization and the destructive interference at the receiver molecule , a moderate amount of energy - level mismatches will improve the light - harvesting efficiency as minimizing both the undesired effects in the energy transfer .",
    "this picture is consistent with our results .",
    "in addition , dephasing noise is found to relaxe the localization and to suppress the undesired interference at the receiver molecule so that the cooperation of energy - level mismatches and dephasing noise significantly improves the transfer efficiency after all .",

    ", we assume that an exciton is created at molecule 1 .",
    "it is clearly shown by seemingly four diagonal lines in ( b ) that destructive interference at the receiver results in the suppression of the transfer efficiency .",
    "the actual suppressing lines are eight but they are overlapped due to the almost equal energy - eigenvalue differences of the sub - complexes . in ( c ) , it is shown that dephasing noise reduces the destructive interference , which consequently enhances the transfer efficiency of the fmo complex ( @xmath227 ) from about @xmath228 to @xmath229 when @xmath230 .",
    "we would note that there can arise destructive interference inside a sub - complex if it has a multi - pathway structure depending on the excited energies and electronic coupling constants of the constituent molecules .",
    "in summary , we investigated the role of energy - level mismatches between sub - complexes in a multi - pathway complex of a light - harvesting complex . for a single - pathway complex",
    ", we showed that the presence of energy - level mismatches never enhances the transfer efficiency , as it is likely to cause the anderson localization that reduces the energy transfer through the energy pathway .",
    "however , we demonstrated that for a multi - pathway complex , the absence of energy - level mismatches causes the quantum destructive interference at the shared molecule , which funnels the excitation energies from the sub - complexes .",
    "we showed that the undesired destructive interference diminishes as introducing energy - level mismatches so that the transfer efficiency is significantly improved , even though they may cause the anderson localization effect and suppress the energy transfer in each energy pathway . due to the competition between the localization effect and the destructive interference at the shared molecule , it is crucial to find an optimal amount of energy - level mismatches so as to maximize the transfer efficiency as minimizing both the undesired effects .",
    "we also showed that the quantum dephasing noise relaxes the energy localization and destroys the destructive interference at the shared molecule , implying that the cooperation of the energy - level mismatches and the dephasing noise significantly increases the transfer efficiency after all .",
    "this mechanism will be qualitatively unaltered even if considering non - markovian noise  @xcite , as long as the role of the noise is to destroy the destructive interference at the shared molecule .",
    "the results presented here suggest that the energy - level mismatches typically given in natural photosynthetic complexes can play a crucial role in the efficient energy transfer .",
    "it is a timely question to investigate the optimal energy landscape with energy - level mismatches and non - uniform electronic couplings in a more elaborate dephasing model which accounts the thermal fluctuations of surrounding proteins and the intra / inter - molecular vibrations  @xcite .",
