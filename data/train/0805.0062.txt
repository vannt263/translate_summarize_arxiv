    "@xmath0 scuti stars are pulsating variables located in the lower part of the classical cepheid instability strip on and just above the main sequence in the hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram with spectral types roughly from a2 to f2 and periods between @xmath3 and @xmath4 days . they are astrophysically interesting variables as their pulsations may give important information about their asteroseismological properties . while the low - amplitude @xmath0 scuti stars ( lads ) tend to be nonradial pulsators with high rotational velocities , the high - amplitude @xmath0 scuti stars ( hads ) are mostly radial pulsators with small rotational velocities ( breger 2000 , mcnamara 2000a ) . following breger ( 2000 ) , we adopt @xmath5 mag for the definition of the hads .",
    "an immense amount of scientific researches concerning @xmath0 scuti stars have taken place during the past few decades ( see the references in breger 2000 ) .",
    "rodriguez & breger ( 2001 ) showed statistical results of the physical properties of 636 @xmath0 scuti stars discovered by individual and all - sky survey(s ) , but hads are still relatively less studied variables . for example ,",
    "between 1/3 and 1/2 of the stars located in the lower instability strip are known to show phetometrically detectable light variability due to pulsation with an amplitude limit between 0.003 and 0.010 mag ( breger 2000 ) , and @xmath6 of the solar - neighborhood stars in the lower instability strip is found to be variable ( poretti et al . 2003 ) , but the incidence of hads phonomenon is almost unknown .",
    "hads are particularly interesting variables as they show relatively large magnitude variations compared to their short periods .",
    "information on the incidence of these variables would help us better understand the nature and evolution of this type of pulsating stars .    in the present paper ,",
    "we calculate the number of stars that are expected to fall in the @xmath0 scuti area of the h - r diagram for the magnitude range and sky coverage of the rotse ( robotic optical transient search experiment ) survey for variables i ( rsv1 ; akerlof et al .",
    "2000 ) catalog . by comparing this number to the actual , observed number of hads in the rsv1",
    ", we estimate the occurrence frequency of hads in the @xmath0 scuti area of the h - r diagram .",
    "observations used for the present study were taken by rotse - i , an array of four telescopes each with an @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath7 field of view ( akerlof et al .",
    "the rotse telescope was operated without any filters so the spectral response is primarily limited by the sensitivity of the ccd . designed to find optical counterparts to gamma - ray bursts",
    ", it spent most of its time automatically surveying the entire visible sky twice each night .    while no filters were used for the rotse observations , the star count model adopted in the present work involves magnitudes in conventional photometric systems . thus transformation from a certain photometric system to the rotse magnitude is necessary .",
    "we adopt the empirical transformation from the @xmath9 and @xmath10 magnitudes to the rotse magnitude that akerlof et al .",
    "( 2000 ) obtained by comparing the tycho catalog ( esa 1997 ) and rotse observations : @xmath11 a constant of 0.5 was inserted here to compensate the magnitude discrepancy between the tycho and rotse data ( p. r. woniak 2005 , private communication ) .",
    "the rsv1 is the result of analyzing 5  % of the available rotse all - sky data over a period of 3 months ( march 15 to june 15 , 1999 ) .",
    "it covers a galactic latitude range of @xmath12 and a longitude range of @xmath13 . out of the 1781 variable stars detected ( mean magnitudes between @xmath14 and 15.5  mag ) , 91 variables ,",
    "of which three are known from the general catalog of variable stars ( gcvs ; kholopov 1998 ) , have been classified into the @xmath0 scuti type by the rsv1 .",
    "however , some of the @xmath0 scuti stars have light curves ( or , periods and amplitudes ) similar to those of w ursae majoris ( w uma ) type eclipsing binaries , which are often misclassified into @xmath0 scuti type pulsating stars particularly when the number of observing epochs are not enough or less rigorous criteria are used in automated classifications .",
    "poretti ( 2001 ) and morgan ( 2003 ) showed that fourier decomposition can be an effective way of identifying some pulsating stars such as hads , rrc , and rrab stars .",
    "jin et al . ( 2003 , 2004 ) conducted follow - up observations for 49 @xmath0 scuti stars in the rsv1 catalog whose fourier parameters show @xmath0 scuti signatures , and found that only 6 of them ( see table [ table : bonafide ] ) are bona fide @xmath0 scuti stars and most of the rest are w uma stars ( note that all of the 6 bona fide @xmath0 scuti stars are hads ) . judging from the fourier parameters of the remaining 42 stars ,",
    "it is quite unlikely that there are additional bona fide hads in the rsv1 catalog .",
    "thus we conclude that the number of hads in the rsv1 survey is @xmath15 , and this number will be compared in  [ sec : comparison ] to the number of @xmath0 scuti candidates in the magnitude and spatial coverage of the rsv1 in order to determine the incidence of the @xmath0 scuti phenomenon .",
    "we choose the rsv1 survey for this comparison as its @xmath0 scuti content has been thoroughly studied and the number of bona fide hads in the survey is reliably given .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     note  from the hipparcos catalog ( esa 1997 ) .",
    "the applicability of the adopted star count model to the rsv1 data was tested by comparing the stellar luminosity functions ( lfs ) predicted by the model to the observed lfs from the rotse survey , towards several positions within the spatial coverage of the rsv1 . for this comparison ,",
    "we use the nothern sky variability survey ( nsvs ; woniak et al .",
    "2004 ) data set , which is a collection of all ( including the non - variable objects ) photometric data from the rotse - i survey .",
    "figure [ fig : hist1 ] compares the lfs from the model and the nsvs data towards 12 positions within the spatial coverage of the rsv1 .",
    "the lfs are shown for the magnitude range of the nsvs , @xmath16 .",
    "the incompleteness of the nsvs generally increases sharply near 15 mag , but it starts at brighter magnitudes at @xmath17 due to significant stellar blending ( woniak et al . 2004 ) .",
    "these phenomena are well seen in figure [ fig : hist1 ] , and we limit our calculation to a magnitude range of @xmath18 and a galactic latitude range of @xmath19 .",
    "other than the discrepancy due to the incompleteness , figure [ fig : hist1 ] shows a generally good agreement between the model and the data at @xmath19 , demonstrating that the adopted star count model can be reliably used for estimating the number of stars in the @xmath0 scuti region of the h - r diagram .",
    "we find that for the magnitude range of @xmath18 and the spatial coverage of the rsv1 with a constraint @xmath19 , the star count model yields a total of 280,210 stars , while it yields 2,441 hads candidate stars , i.e. , stars with spectral types from @xmath20 to @xmath21 . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : rsv1 ] , there appear to be 6 bona fide hads in the rsv1 catalog , but only 4 of them satisfy @xmath19 and @xmath22  mag ( see table [ table : bonafide ] ) . since the detection efficiency of the hads in the rsv1 survey is estimated to be @xmath23  % ( see  [ sec : complete ] ) , the incidence of the hads pheonomenon in the @xmath0 scuti region of the h - r diagram becomes @xmath24  % . considering only the poisson noises ,",
    "the relative uncertainty involved with our estimate for the incidence is @xmath23  % .",
    "this uncertainty is rather large , but our calculation certainly gives an order - of - magnitude estimate for the incidence .",
    "our estimate for the incidence of the hads , 0.3  % , is much lower than that of the lads , @xmath25 , implying that the hads phenomenon takes place in a very small fraction of stars and/or its duration is very short , compared to the lads .",
    "as the relations between hads and lads in terms of their origins and natures are still uncertain , our estimate for the incidence of hads in the @xmath0 scuti region of the h - r diagram will be useful in revealing their relations to the lads .      we are grateful to m. breger , c. akerlof , p. r. wzniak , seung - lee kim , g. pojmanski , and b. paczynski for their valuable discussions and help .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for his / her helpful comments , which greatly improved our manuscript .",
