    "cosmic history from the decoupling ( @xmath4 ) to the epoch of lighting of the first luminous sources ( at redshifts @xmath5 to 5 ) is one of the biggest unknowns of present  day observational cosmology .",
    "high redshifts and dust extinction during early active phases both degrade the energetic optical  uv photons emitted by massive stars , decaying particles , or more exotic energy sources , to the infrared wavelengths . a fundamental information on the total energy budget associated with astrophysical processes occurring at high redshifts is then provided by observations of the cosmic background at infrared wavelengths ( cirb ) .",
    "unfortunately , the infrared domain presents various levels of difficulty to the observational astronomer , because of the huge backgrounds from the earth s atmosphere , the interplanetary dust ( ipd ) , and diffuse dust in the milky way , in addition to the background produced by the telescope itself . also the sensitivity and stability of infrared detectors are far poorer than those used in the optical .",
    "because of all this , the detection and characterization of the diffuse background flux of low - energy photons coming from primeval structures has been exceedingly difficult so far .",
    "even dedicated experiments exploiting cooled platforms outside the atmosphere , among which the most important is dirbe on cobe ( @xcite ) , have failed so far to detect significant signals from the cirb above the intense foregrounds .",
    "the upper limits allowed by the foreground emission deconvolution of dirbe maps are significantly higher than expectations over a substantial  and crucial  @xmath6range from a few to @xmath7 @xmath8",
    "the situation , at these wavelengths in particular , is not likely to improve in the future , until a mission flying to the outer solar system will get rid of the fundamental limitation set by the ipd ( both the scattered light and dust re  radiation ) .    under these circumstances ,",
    "a very interesting alternative to the direct detection of cirb photons has been suggested by stecker and de jager ( 1993 ) soon after the discovery of high - energy photon fluxes coming from distant blazars ( with gro , @xcite and with the whipple observatory , @xcite ) .",
    "the idea is to infer the cirb spectral intensity from combined gev and tev observations of a set of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , by exploiting the @xmath9 interactions and pair production between the agn high  energy photons and low ",
    "energy background photons in the line  of  sight to the source .",
    "the interaction is expected to produce an absorption feature , testable in principle , in the source tev spectrum .",
    "interesting limits have been discussed by stecker and de jager ( 1993 ) , de jager , stecker and salamon ( 1994 ) , and dwek and slavin ( 1994 ) , _ all based on tev observations of the blazar mkn 421_.    to summarize , the best current upper limits on the cirb in the spectral range from 10 to 40 micron are those reported by de jager , stecker & salamon ( 1994 ) , with a @xmath10 upper limit of @xmath11 . in the same large waveband interval ,",
    "marginal detections , at levels of @xmath12 were reported by de jager , stecker & salamon ( 1994 ) and dwek & slavin ( 1994 ) . at shorter wavelengths ,",
    "1 to 10 @xmath8 m , upper limits have been obtained by stecker & de jager ( 1993 ) , stecker ( 1996 ) , dwek & slavin ( 1994 ) and biller et al .",
    "the most conservative bounds , accounting for the precise spectral shape of the cirb , given by dwek & slavin ( 1994 , @xmath13 ) , still keep a substantial factor ( @xmath1410 ) higher than the expected contribution of known sources .    while all previous analyses relied uniquely on tev observations of the blazar mkn 421 ,",
    "we exploit here a new high  quality dataset of tev gamma ",
    "ray observations by hegra of mkn 501 during a state of high activity ( aharonian et al 1997a ) to further constrain the intensity of the diffuse ir background .",
    "two sets of constraints on the cirb spectral intensity are derived in section 2 .",
    "one is based on the assumption that the background spectrum is dominated by the contribution of distant galaxies , and thus reflects the average galactic ir spectrum .",
    "the other constraint is free of model ",
    "dependent assumptions and treats the cirb as a combination of twelve bins wherein the background spectrum is flat ( in @xmath15 ) with independent arbitrary normalizations .",
    "extremely tight constraints on the cirb ensue from this analysis , reflecting the missing evidence of any absorption in the tev spectrum of mkn 501 .",
    "a discussion is given in section 3 in terms of a low average past emissivity both of galaxies and of primeval energy sources .",
    "indeed the limits are so severe that they begin to conflict with the integrated ir flux of distant galaxies , recently detected in large numbers by ground - based and space observatories .",
    "we finally emphasize the alternative possibility that the interaction of high - energy gamma - rays with low - energy photons is more complex than previously supposed .",
    "@xmath16 is assumed throughout the paper .",
    "we use the data set taken in march and april 1997 with the hegra stereoscopic system of four imaging cherenkov telescopes ( @xcite ) . at that time mkn 501 was in an extremely high state , the far brightest gamma - ray source in the sky .",
    "the flare was observed by all tev @xmath0ray observatories in the northern hemisphere ( @xcite ) .",
    "the high gamma  ray flux allowed the hegra observatory to measure the gamma ",
    "ray energy spectrum in short time intervals .",
    "the spectrum measured between march 15 to 20 covers 1.2 orders of magnitude in photon energy , from 0.8 to 12.6 tev , divided into twelve logarithmically spaced energy bins .",
    "the photon number spectrum at tev @xmath0ray energies is consistent with a power law of differential spectral index @xmath17 = 2.49@xmath180.11 .",
    "this spectrum is shown in figure  1 ( data points ) together with the allowed range of best  fitting power ",
    "laws derived by the observational team ( shaded region ) .",
    "similar power - law spectra for mkn 501 have been observed by various other groups ( see e.g. protheroe et al .",
    "1997 ) .    the main difficulty with the derivation of the cirb spectral intensity from tev @xmath0ray absorption is the lack of knowledge of the production spectrum , which may deviate from a pure power - law and/or show absorption at the source .",
    "spectra measured within short time intervals , during which the source s activity state is not likely to vary , are very valuable in this respect , although there is not an evidence for strong spectral variability of the mkn501 emission(@xcite ) . for this reason we confined our analysis to a spectrum based on data collected between march 15 to 20 , rather than the one using the whole march - april database in the updated version of aharonian et al ( 1997a ) .    as a first step in understanding the observed spectrum",
    ", we attempted to derive the allowed range of differential spectral indices @xmath17 at the source and the cirb absorption by fitting the observed @xmath0ray spectrum with a variety of assumptions for @xmath17 and for the intensity @xmath19 of the extragalactic ir background .",
    "we first assumed that the source spectrum in the observed range is a pure power - law and that the low - energy background is dominated by the integrated contribution of distant galaxies .",
    "in such a case , the shape of the cirb is well constrained , and should reflect the average galactic spectrum , which has a minimum at @xmath20 corresponding to the intersection of the stellar with the dust emission component .",
    "we refer here to the detailed spectral shape estimated by franceschini et al ( 1991 ) .",
    "then the fit was performed in a two parameter space consisting of the source gamma - ray spectral index @xmath17 and the cirb intensity @xmath19 normalized to the model spectrum @xmath21 ) by franceschini et al ( 1991 ) . for a given spectral index @xmath17 the absorption due to the cirb",
    "was first calculated and the resulting spectrum was then normalized to the detected @xmath0ray flux above 1 tev .",
    "this procedure enabled us to avoid introducing a third parameter , the source spectrum normalization .",
    "table  1 shows the optical depth assuming @xmath22 = 1 , for all twelve experimental energy bins .",
    "figure  2 summarizes the results of fitting the observed mkn 501 spectrum .",
    "it plots contours of the @xmath23 2d distribution in the parameter plane , including the unphysical region corresponding to negative @xmath22 values , where gamma ",
    "rays are ` created ' in collisions with cirb photons .",
    "the darker an area is the better the fit is ( except for fits with @xmath24 1.45 , corresponding to the blank inner region ) .",
    "the formal best fit ( @xmath25 = 1.41 p.d.f . for 10 degrees of freedom , confidence level 0.16 ) is in the `` unphysical '' region : @xmath17 = 2.52 , @xmath22 = -0.3 .",
    "the best fit in the `` physical '' region occurs at @xmath26 = 0 ( no - absorption , @xmath25 = 1.42 p.d.f . ) and yields @xmath17 = 2.48 , in agreement with the result of the experimental group .",
    "flatter tev @xmath0ray source spectra allow for higher intergalactic absorption : a value for the spectral index of @xmath27 , corresponding to @xmath22 = 1.70 , is the hardest spectrum with @xmath28 1.80 ( corresponding to the 95% confidence limit ) .",
    "the best - fit spectra corresponding to @xmath22=0 and the flattest one assuming @xmath22 = 1.7 are also shown in fig .  1 .",
    "it is important to understand that the fit quality , and correspondingly the limits on the cirb , depend crucially on the manner in which the ` theoretical ' power - law fluxes are normalized in the fitting procedure .",
    "the normalization to the observed @xmath0ray flux above 1 tev causes very different spectral indices to fit the observations equally well and generates a broad @xmath23 valley in fig.2 .",
    "this would change significantly if the observed @xmath0ray energy range were extended on either side .",
    "an observation at @xmath29 300 gev ( the threshold energy of the whipple telescope ) would improve the overall normalization and allow us to distinguish better between different spectral indices ` at production ' .",
    "an extension to higher @xmath0ray energy , hence larger optical depths ( see table  1 ) would make easier the detection of any absorption by the cirb .",
    "we finally attempted to obtain model ",
    "independent limits on the cirb , with no a - priori guess at the background spectrum . to compute them we conservatively assumed that the high - energy source spectrum is the flattest allowed by the fits of fig .  1 , i.e. @xmath17 = 2.16 .",
    "we normalize the spectrum at the source to be @xmath30 in the first experimental bin .",
    "this normalization factor is a source of uncertainty .",
    "it is partially justified by the fact that mkn 501 is close enough ( 136 mpc ) compared to the optical depth ( 600 mpc for @xmath31 ) that the content of this bin would be absorbed only by 20% .",
    "the absorption of @xmath0rays of energy @xmath32 tev is due to ir photons within a certain wavelength interval around the maximum absorption at @xmath33 = @xmath34 ( @xmath35 m ) .",
    "we have then assumed that the absorption of any given @xmath0ray energy bin is caused by cirb with flat @xmath36 spectrum .",
    "the envelope of all upper limits to the cirb intensity obtained in this way is shown as a histogram in fig .",
    "the limits are assigned within wavelength intervals that contribute 90% of the optical depth for that bin .",
    "as we see , the limits become less stringent at longer wavelengths .",
    "the limit in the 3.4 @xmath8 m to 24 @xmath8 m range comes from one single energy bin ( 5.0 to 6.3 tev ) where a particularly large @xmath0ray flux was measured .",
    "_ note that the obtained upper limits fall already very close to recent direct evaluations of the ir background based on deep ir surveys ( @xcite)_. as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the upper limits heavily rely on the error in the tev flux measurement and are less stringent for @xmath37 10 @xmath8 m , where the tev @xmath0ray statistics is not as good .",
    "in either case , both assuming the cirb shape and relaxing it , the constraints on the cirb intensity appear dramatic . essentially the mkn 501 gamma - ray spectrum does not display the expected effect of absorption , it rather shows a simple @xmath38 power - law spectrum .",
    "how reliable are these limits in view of the possible systematic errors of @xmath3925% in the energy estimates of the hegra telescopes ( @xcite ) ?",
    "this is very easy to estimate in the case of a flat binned @xmath15 cirb spectrum .",
    "the limits in figure 3 would move upward and towards shorter wavelengths with the fractional amount of energy overestimate .",
    "similar relaxation would occur also in the case of a more specialized model cirb spectrum .",
    "one could use the optical depths from table  1 to estimate the amount of relaxation .",
    "similarly , a higher normalization of the source spectrum would relax the model ",
    "independent limits by the ratio of the two normalizations .",
    "is this featureless spectrum of mkn 501 inconsistent with that observed for mkn 421 , which is almost at the same distance ?",
    "the latter has been interpreted by some authors ( e.g. @xcite ) as showing a turnover at @xmath40 , which was attributed to @xmath1 absorption with the cirb .",
    "in fact , new observations of this source during a high activity state do not appear to confirm the presence of absorption ( krennrich et al .",
    "1997 ) , and show significant counting rate above 5 tev .",
    "so , at least during this high state , mkn 421 seems to show a power law spectrum similar to the spectrum discussed here for mkn 501 .",
    "the constraints on the cirb intensity from tev observations of mkn 501 start to approach the `` measured '' lower limits at 2.2 , 6.7 and 15 @xmath8 m given by the integrated emission of galaxies already resolved in deep integrations at those wavelengths .",
    "deep surveys have been performed from ground in the k - band and from space by the mid  ir camera ( isocam , see  @xcite ) on the iso satellite in the two latter bands .",
    "a summary of these `` direct '' determinations of the galaxy contribution to the cirb , and a discussion of the related uncertainties , are given by franceschini et al ( 1997 ) and oliver et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . in any case",
    ", the cirb can not be lower than reported at these three wavelengths .",
    "few possibilities are left .",
    "the first one is that the cirb is very close to the limits allowed by the gamma  ray spectrum of mkn 501 observed by aharonian et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "this would imply a very strong constraint on any signals unrelated to the emission of distant galaxies ( see e.g. @xcite , for a review ) .",
    "but , in view of the fact that the same power - law spectral shape as show in fig . 1 for mkn 501 has been confirmed by later integrations on this source ( aharonian et al .",
    "1997a ; protheroe et al .",
    "1997 ) , that apparently a similar shape is also suggested for mkn 421 , and because an appreciable cirb flux has already been detected and resolved into discrete sources , we find more likely that _ we have to revise our concepts about the propagation of tev gamma - rays into the intergalactic space , and that something complicates the process_.    the question is : why the propagation of tev gamma - rays in intergalactic space should not produce the expected absorption in high energy spectra of distant sources ?",
    "a possible solution could be that part of the source spectrum is regenerated in @xmath0ray cascading ( pair production + inverse compton ) . in such a cascading process , the @xmath0ray spectrum of the source is depleted around the region of maximum absorption .",
    "if the @xmath0ray emission of mkn 501 at the source extends above @xmath41 ev , the spectrum would be depleted in collisions with microwave background photons .",
    "the @xmath42 pairs generated on the microwave background would inverse compton scatter on the microwave background to regenerate photons of lower ( tev ) energy , thus generating ` bumps ' on a power - law production spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath0ray spectrum may then appear unattenuated at observation .",
    "this would however require not only a @xmath0ray spectrum extending to very high energy , but also a very low ( @xmath43 gauss ) value for the extragalactic magnetic field in the direction of mkn501 .",
    "otherwise the @xmath42 pairs would deflect in the magnetic field and form a halo around the source , well outside of the angular resolution of the hegra detector .    a good deal of constraints useful to disentangle between these two possibilities are soon expected by improved observations of the mkn501 outburst ( which has been observed by the whipple and cat cherenkov telescopes , @xcite ) with different energy thresholds and wavelength bands and by refined forthcoming data on mkn 421 . +",
