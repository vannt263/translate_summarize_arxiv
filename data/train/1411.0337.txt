    "the question whether quantum states  or at least their observable properties  are real , independent from deliberate measurements , has been asked already in the early days of quantum mechanics , leading to notorious einstein - podolsky - rosen paradox @xcite . at the same time",
    "a realistic interpretation appeared in the form of bohm - de broglie pilot wave theory @xcite , which by construction is impossible to falsify .",
    "however , it never gained wide - spread acceptance due to its manifest nonlinearity , difficulties with generalizations and nonlocality . for this last reason , this interpretation also fails to construct _ local _ reality . as shown later by bell",
    "@xcite , local reality is in conflict with the results of a simple ideal experiment ( bell test ) , never conclusively verified @xcite due to experimental nonidealities / loopholes @xcite .",
    "pusey , rudolph and barrett ( pbr)@xcite and colbeck and renner ( cr ) @xcite have recently shown that local reality can not hold under some assumptions of ( almost ) perfect measurements .",
    "a different viewpoint on quantum reality assumes that the measurement or more precisely collapse takes place spontaneously and continuously , independently of our will , hence objectively , blurred by random noise . in this case objective reality",
    "does not necessarily applies to the formal quantum state itself but rather its observations .",
    "such continuous objective collapse theories invented by ghirardi , rimini and weber ( grw ) @xcite are much more attractive to become candidates for objective realism than bohm - de broglie because they are constructed using standard theory of quantum measurements , projection postulate @xcite , but generalized to positive operator - valued measures ( povm ) @xcite . strong measurements ( projections ) , general povms and objective collapse could in principle reveal reality , which is the major strength of grw approach .",
    "however , the two problems with collapse  absent in bohm - de brogile  are that it ( i ) makes the quantum dynamics nonunitary ( interrupted by irreversibility of collapse ) and ( ii ) leads to constant heating of the system which is the whole universe , although at very small rate .",
    "the second problem can be resolved introducing a heat sink , then it leads to thermalization of the universe .    here",
    "we construct quantum objective realism for observations of a quantum state that on one hand leaves the quantum dynamics unitary ( dynamically reversible ) without heating , being linear and causal on the other hand .",
    "the question of locality requires introducing freedom of choice , which will be the future step .",
    "the construction is analogous to weak _",
    "limit _ of continuous collapse by grw @xcite or weak measurement @xcite .",
    "weak measurement is in fact noninvasive as it does not disturb the measured system , but only in the zero - strength limit .",
    "such measurements are beyond pbr and cr assumptions , requiring rather strong than weak measurements .",
    "the problem with weak , noninvasive measurements is that direct interpretation of their result leads to strange _ weak values _ , which may exceed intuitive spectrum ( being e.g. @xmath0 for the spin @xmath1 @xcite ) .",
    "this is possible because weak measurements make a natural separation between ( large , or infinite in the weak limit ) detection noise / error , independent of the measured system , and system - only - dependent statistical measure , which reveals to be a quasiprobability rather than a standard nonnegative probability @xcite .",
    "on one hand the limiting quasiprobability alone can not describe objective realism as it can be negative , on the other hand the detection noise can not be made infinite , either .",
    "we propose to take the limiting quasiprobability and add a finite amount of external ( replacing infinite detection ) noise , only to make it positive .",
    "it can be interpreted as grw collapse without disturbance .",
    "this applies to both finite and continuous but countable variables ( e.g. regularized charge density ) , although for an infinite number of variables only moments and cumulants up to a finite order can strictly correspond to positive probability .",
    "we will show that this is always possible within the realistic constraints , that the noise should be negligible and unobservable on macroscopic level .",
    "however , it is impossible to construct objective realism , combined with unitary dynamics , linearity and causality , which is invariant with respect to relativistic frame transformations .",
    "although the underlying quasiprobability can be made invariant , the added noise can not .",
    "moreover , time symmetry must be also broken @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first construct objective probability by a convolution of noise and quantum quasiprobability .",
    "then the general procedure of adding noise to get positive probability from quasiprobability is outlined .",
    "next , the problem of broken relativistic invariance is discussed and finally realistic constraints of the noise are proposed .",
    "some mathematical details are moved to appendices .",
    "we shall use standard relativistic notation , with @xmath2 , real coordinates @xmath3 with single time @xmath4 , ( flat ) metric tensor @xmath5 and minkowski product @xmath6 , shift @xmath7 , derivatives @xmath8 , integration measure @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we shall not treat time and position as physical quantities , only descriptors of spacetime .",
    "we assume that observable physical quantities @xmath11 in spacetime such as field @xmath12 and current @xmath13 are _ objectively real _ so they always have some values . however , they can be random , with some non - negative and normalized probability distribution functional @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "we also assume that @xmath15 is a convolution of some external ( non - quantum ) noise probability @xmath16 and a quantum quasiprobability @xmath17 , @xmath18=n\\ast q=\\int \\mathrm{d}a '   n[a']q(a - a').\\label{conv}\\ ] ] in the case when @xmath17 is a normal ( positive ) probability such a convolution appears naturally in classical physics when two independent probability distributions are combined .",
    "now we have to make connection with quantum mechanics . each observable @xmath19 ( the index will be dropped when unimportant ) can have its counterpart in objective reality @xmath20 .",
    "some selection of observables is necessary , we can take at least those appearing in the macroscopic world , such as charge , current , electromagnetic field",
    ". instead of measurements , which are intuitively invasive and require deliberate actions , we shall describe observations , which are passive and nondisturbing .",
    "observations take place in the whole spacetime so this description is in practice informationally complete even without explicit reconstruction of the full quantum state . from the property of convolution",
    "we have adding up averages and correlations , @xmath21 and @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath16 is simply adding its own contribution , we will _ postulate _ that objective correlators of observations like @xmath24 should be related to their equivalents in quantum mechanics , which will be represented by @xmath17 replacing @xmath25 in the correlator by a superoperator @xmath26 in heisenberg picture and perform time order @xcite : @xmath27 here , @xmath28 denotes time order with respect to the arguments @xmath29 in brackets , @xmath30 means quantum average @xmath31 with the initial state density matrix @xmath32 .",
    "superoperators should fulfill linearity and causality  outcomes can depend only linearly on operators within their lightcones , which imposes the form @xmath33 the superoperators @xmath34 @xcite act on any operator @xmath35 as an anticommutator / commutator : @xmath36 and @xmath37/i$ ] . alternatively @xmath38 and @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in the above expressions we assumed that observations are stationary so that only relative differences @xmath42 matter .",
    "please note that the time order is irrelevant for spacelike intervals ( @xmath43 with @xmath44 ) because then the operators commute .",
    "the commuting property can be shown using closed time path theory @xcite for each feynman diagram @xcite .",
    "hence , time order is here in fact causal order , consistent with relativity .",
    "the quasiprobability @xmath17 itself can be formally expressed by dirac @xmath45 with operators inside , @xmath46 note that time ordering @xmath28 makes it important to expand @xmath45 as a time - ordered series if @xmath47 may overlap .",
    "we will also assume that the average of single observation coincides with the usual average for projective measurements , i.e. @xmath48 .",
    "this implies @xmath49 .",
    "other choices of @xmath50 simply mimic the effect of classical filters",
    ". however , its is reasonable to expect _ causality _ , namely @xmath51 for @xmath52 , which implies zero also for @xmath53 by invariance .",
    "thus the only freedom left is the choice of the real memory function @xmath54 that multiplies @xmath55 .",
    "note that @xmath56 can be non - zero for @xmath57 without violating causality , since it is accompanied by @xmath55 and only future observations are affected .",
    "for the last observations , future effects disappear because the leftmost @xmath55 vanishes under the trace in eq .",
    "( [ avgabs ] ) . in the markovian case @xmath58 .",
    "the formula ( [ avgabs ] ) can be derived from the weak measurement approach , see [ appa ] .",
    "note however that the above construction is beyond standard theory of noninvasive measurements @xcite , where either the noise @xmath16 was infinite , or @xmath17 contained the effect of detector s disturbance .",
    "however , @xmath16 is decoupled from quantum dynamics , so no detection process is able to amplify it to macroscopic level . in fact",
    "@xmath16 allows to assign objective reality to microscopic systems , but remains negligible , and hence unobservable , macroscopically .",
    "in the case of position @xmath59 and momentum @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( in arbitrary order ) with @xmath58 , @xmath17 becomes well - known wigner function , which is a quasiprobability @xcite , but can be made positive adding noise and obtaining positive husimi function @xcite . for @xmath63 and harmonic system@xcite",
    "one reveals another quasiprobability  glauber - sudarshan function @xcite . the definition ( [ qqq ] ) is a generalization of wigner function to arbitrary set of time - dependent observables .",
    "let us demonstrate the nontrivial effect of the noise @xmath16 on the quantum statistics in a simple two - level model , with states @xmath64 , and observables ( pauli matrices ) @xmath65 and @xmath66 analogously to @xcite .",
    "the observables correspond to observations @xmath11 , @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "we have to specify time order of the observations . for simplicity",
    "we take @xmath58 ( markovian case ) .",
    "let us prepare the state @xmath68 and ask for the joint probability @xmath11 and @xmath67 , with first @xmath69 then @xmath70 .",
    "the quasiprobability @xmath17 in this case is not continuous but a kind of discrete wigner function ( consisting of @xmath45 peaks in continuous representation ) , and can be calculated exactly , with the results in table [ tab1 ] , see also detailed calculation in [ appx ] .",
    ".quasiprobability as a function of @xmath11 and @xmath67 of the observables first @xmath71 then @xmath72 [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the negative quasiprobability appears in the entry @xmath73 .",
    "the probability @xmath15 can be written in terms of the noise @xmath16 @xmath74 assuming a gaussian noise @xmath75 ( with @xmath76 ) helps to make it positive but not everywhere , because @xmath77 which is negative for @xmath78 .",
    "the problem is that gaussian decays too rapidly .",
    "however , taking @xmath79 with sufficiently small @xmath80 we get everywhere positive @xmath15 .",
    "in fact such an exponential noise gives positive @xmath15 for any _ finite _ number of observables in a finite space .",
    "unfortunately this is not the case of infinite sequences , similarly as in pbr and cr arguments .",
    "suppose that we demand objective reality for any sequence containing @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "for instance , we can map the problem on values for time resolved observable @xmath81 by introducing the hamiltonian @xmath82 which periodically alternates between @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "let us take an arbitrarily large sequence @xmath83 then all last @xmath70s will have the same value for the quasiprobability @xmath17 because of the product @xmath84 with the same @xmath85 , see also [ appx ] .",
    "let us add any noise to @xmath67 , independent for every @xmath70 , @xmath86 .",
    "let @xmath87 be the point where @xmath16 is maximal",
    ". then @xmath88 will be negative for a sufficiently long sequence because of multiplication of factors @xmath89 which are smaller than @xmath90 and the fact that @xmath91 .",
    "on the other hand , taking perfectly correlated noise @xmath92 immediately fails for the sequence @xmath93 . in this case",
    "@xmath94 will be negative if @xmath95 is maximal in @xmath96 because it has no help from @xmath97 .",
    "the presented example shows that our proposal fails ideal infinite cases .",
    "however , they can be excluded from our considerations for two reasons : ( i ) real imperfections of ideal few - level models and ( ii ) not every observable must have an exact counterpart in objective reality  the actual observable is only indirectly related to the two - level space .",
    "this is also why repeated measurements in this case are good to test the noise model , which is rarely done . for a moment ,",
    "only long coherence experiments @xcite may need such special care .",
    "therefore we propose an approach based on moments and cumulants . for @xmath15 , @xmath16 and",
    "@xmath17 we can define generating function @xmath98 and moments @xmath99 .",
    "moments and cumulants can be obtained by differentiation of @xmath100 and @xmath101 at @xmath102 , respectively , @xmath103 in fact , @xmath104 can be expressed by combinations of cumulants @xmath105 for @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , ... and viceversa , e.g @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 ( note that @xmath112 , @xmath113 ) . as generating functions factorize @xmath114 , cumulants from independent distributions simply add up , as in our case , @xmath115 .",
    "all moments with respect to @xmath15 can be expressed in terms of ( finite combinations of ) moments with respect to @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "this does not limit the total number of observables but only their number in a single average .",
    "apart from ideal models , quantum mechanics , by e.g. keldysh formalism @xcite makes predictions rather in the form of moments ( correlations ) than full probability , hence this approach is more practical .",
    "moreover , since the present standard model of quantum mechanics must break down at extremely small distances and times ( or high energies ) it is plausible that it also can not reliably describe very high moments . in frequent situations of discrete outcomes , which might require full probability , one can also rewrite the problem in terms of moments , e.g. bell test @xcite , where the condition @xmath116 is replaced by @xmath117 . then",
    "the nonnegativity of @xmath15 follows from @xmath118 for any real - valued positive polynomial @xmath119 , e.g. @xmath120 , @xmath121 or @xmath122 .",
    "we shall demand nonnegativity of @xmath15 in this weaker sense , that only positive polynomials @xmath54 up to certain degree @xmath123 satisfy @xmath124 , which is expressed by moments up to the same degree .",
    "then is it enough to take @xmath16 as a gaussian noise , which has only nonzero @xmath125 ( variance ) .",
    "sufficiently large @xmath125 will always make @xmath126 positive .",
    "it is evident if we reconstruct first some @xmath17 for discrete events _ near _ origin , given the known moments .",
    "then we put events with small probability _ far _ from the origin in all main directions , say @xmath127 , and correct the quasiprobabilites @xmath128 of the near events to restore original moments .",
    "a convolution of gaussian @xmath16 with variance @xmath129 than makes @xmath15 positive , because it will be almost constant ( and positive ) around near events and elsewhere dominated by far ( also positive ) ones , from the fact that @xmath130 for @xmath131 .",
    "this demonstrates the positivity of @xmath15 in the weak sense .",
    "note that the case ( [ pnn ] ) will cause problems only if we let @xmath123 be unbounded .",
    "we ask if @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be constructed without introducing any preferred frame , except when defined by the quantum state itself .",
    "although not absolutely necessary , such condition could be desired . as we shall see below ,",
    "this is impossible if the observable is a vector field and barely possible for scalar fields .",
    "nevertheless , our construction outlined in sec . [ secon ] can be made but only in some preferred frame .",
    "if both @xmath50 and @xmath54 are invariant then all correlators with respect to @xmath17 are also invariant , especially in the invariant vacuum state @xcite , so the only possible problem can be with @xmath16 .",
    "we denote fourier transform @xmath132 . for any normal probability , we have cauchy - schwarz type inequality @xmath133 with some regularization @xmath134 , i.e. @xmath135 .",
    "let us take a vector field ( current ) @xmath136 and the vacuum zero - temperature state , which is itself invariant @xcite .",
    "then , for an arbitrary stationary and relativistically invariant probability , we have @xmath137 which must be positive definite . for spacelike @xmath138",
    "it is positive only if @xmath139 ( we could even use charge conservation to set @xmath140 ) .",
    "taking @xmath141 for @xmath142 we have then @xmath143  for the regularization we should replace @xmath144 by @xmath145 with @xmath146 .",
    "however , the expression @xmath147 usually does not vanish in the markovian scheme ( @xmath58 ) , see an example in [ appb ] if @xmath148 so the inequality ( [ cs1 ] ) is clearly violated .",
    "in the non - markovian case we can take the invariant generalization of @xmath54 derived in @xcite which is @xmath149 .",
    "however , then fourth order correlations in vacuum still vanish .",
    "it follows from unitarity which implies vanishing @xmath150 .",
    "then @xmath151 ( right - hand side symmetrized ) . by feynman rules nonvanishing crossing @xmath152",
    "must be timelike ( @xmath153 ) @xcite .",
    "hence , our expression vanishes if all the fourier arguments of @xmath71 are spacelike which is the case when all functions @xmath54 are zero . we must take 6th order correlations , e.g. the cauchy - schwarz inequality @xmath154",
    "is violated by nonvanishing left hand side ( example in [ appb ] ) .",
    "the important consequence is that we can not construct any invariant objective realism , using ( [ conv ] ) and ( [ avgabs ] ) for vector fields .",
    "this conclusion is completely general if only we can somehow argue that the left hand side is nonzero . it does not prevent from construction of non - invariant realism , see also next section , but puts relativity at stake , it is possible that not only objective realism fails to be invariant but the quantum theory itself at extremely high energies .    for scalar fields @xmath155 we can formally make the autocorrelation @xmath156 positive for all @xmath138 .",
    "however , from the _ correspondence principle _ follows that zero - frequency ( long - time ) quantum equilibrium correlations satisfy classical fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite , which makes them vanish in vacuum ( zero - temperature ) .",
    "this fact follows directly from closed time path formalism @xcite and does not rely at all on relativity . on the other hand , correlations can be invariant only at zero temperature vacuum . then all vacuum zero - frequency correlations must vanish and , from invariance , @xmath157 must vanish for all spacelike @xmath138 so the inequality ( [ cs1 ] ) or ( [ cs2 ] ) will be violated by a scalar analogue of the previous example .",
    "this shows that autocorrelation for @xmath16 at spacelike @xmath138 must violate correspondence principle .",
    "another attempt to restore invariance would be a classical filter permitting only timelike momenta , i.e. @xmath158 for spacelike @xmath138 .",
    "unfortunately it would violate relativistic causality , as for invariant @xmath50 , for spacelike @xmath159 we get @xmath160 ( with bessel @xmath123 ) @xcite which is always somewhere nonzero .",
    "it follows rigorously from nonvanishing fourier transform of @xmath161 which can be expressed by gamma functions , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we can not also take @xmath162 as it gives complex @xmath56 .",
    "the invariance and correspondence principle at zero temperature will be hence broken in our construction of objective reality , at least spontaneously .",
    "once we accept this , it is easy to find an analogy with a particular gaussian measurement scheme ( [ appc ] ) , apparently invariant @xcite , but supplemented by a heat sink in a preferred frame to become stationary . only formalisms beyond standard correspondence principle or quantum field theory may allow relativistically invariant realism @xcite .",
    "the noise @xmath16 can of course be partly from some coexistent system or universe , but never all , due to the violation of invariance and correspondence principle .",
    "once we learned that the noise can not be invariant , we can define it in a preferred frame .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath16 is white gaussian and zero - centered with the correlations @xmath163 with positive @xmath164 , @xmath165 .",
    "this is not a quantum amplitude but classical correlation function .",
    "the noise will make @xmath15 positive for a finite number of moments , depending on @xmath164 , as we have shown in general in sec .",
    "the exact relation between @xmath164 and the order of moments needs to be found for concrete quantum field theories .",
    "noise correlations obeying these requirements are analogous as in the general quantum measurement formalism , based on kraus operators @xcite , see appendix [ appc ] , which is a straightforward extension of the analysis of @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath164 can be only estimated from the fact that the noise is invisible macroscopically . taking electric charge ,",
    "suppose that we can observe a capacitor in a @xmath166 mm box in a tenth second , which contains about @xmath167 atoms ( electrons and protons , to simplify ) .",
    "this gives an estimate @xmath168m@xmath169 . on the other hand at the level of single atoms ,",
    "the relevant scales are : length @xmath170 m , time ( in meters ) @xmath171 m , which gives the noise constant to compare @xmath172m@xmath169 .",
    "therefore the inherent quantum noise , and also all higher correlations , which rely on the same scales , can be much smaller than the external noise .",
    "if we make the noise non - white , frequency - dependent , the estimate can be pushed even much higher . in long coherence setups",
    "@xcite , we can add a resonant noise .",
    "that noise is also decoupled from all dynamical quantum evolution , so there is in principle no way to measure it , except estimation based on personal perception . it can be even much larger than our estimate and only common sense tell us when it becomes unrealistic .",
    "we have constructed objective quantum reality developed on weak , noninvasive measurements and satisfying linearity and causality but not relativistic invariance .",
    "the reality is represented by a nonnegative probability measure for observations and its cumulants / moments , a convolution of quantum quasiprobability and external noise .",
    "the latter can not be relativistically invariant and must violate correspondence principle .",
    "these two principles , valid so far both in quantum and classical physics , but impossible in quantum objective realism , are therefore put at stake and further theoretical and experimental studies are necessary to check their general validity .",
    "a reasonable value of the noise ensures that the net probability will be positive , while remaining macroscopically unobservable .",
    "an open question remains whether one can make this objective reality _ local _ , which however , needs further generalization , including freedom of choice .",
    "i thank w. belzig , p. chankowski and p. pearle for discussions , hints and inspirations that helped me to complete this work .",
    "we shall derive the form ( [ avgabs ] ) and ( [ avg2 ] ) by taking noninvasive limit in the general quantum measurement formalism , based on kraus operators @xmath173 @xcite .",
