    "wd debris discs represents an important step towards establishing a unified evolution theory .",
    "this evolution is not limited to planets .",
    "both protoplanetary and wd discs contain dust and potentially asteroids or other small bodies .",
    "in fact , asteroids represent the favoured progenitors of wd discs for at least three reasons :    * at least one asteroid has now been observed to be disintegrating in real time around wd 1145 + 017 @xcite * planets collide with wds too infrequently @xcite as do exo - oort cloud comets @xcite * measured bulk compositions in wd atmospheres are incompatible with those from solar system comets @xcite    therefore , understanding the interaction between planets and asteroids is paramount for wd planet studies .",
    "further , the wide range of wd cooling ages ( the time since the star became a wd ) at which metal pollution is observed ( up to 5 gyr ; see @xcite and @xcite ) necessitate understanding the long - term evolution of planets and asteroids .",
    "for a recent review summarizing our current knowledge of the long - term behaviour of planetary systems , see @xcite , and for post - main - sequence systems in particular , see @xcite .    for the more specific case of an asteroid and planet interacting under the guises of the restricted three - body problem ( rtbp ) ,",
    "a vast body of literature has covered specific examples and techniques .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite analytically and numerically determined the long - timescale stability of asteroids in or near mean motion resonance ( mmr ) under the guise of the planar elliptic rtbp , and focused on computing lyapunov times .",
    "other measures of chaos , such as megno @xcite , have also been applied to the elliptic rtbp .",
    "@xmath0-body numerical integrations provide a crucial means of determining orbital evolution , but can be computationally demanding . alternatively , predictive analytic formulations may yield the desired result more quickly , but their correctness is subject to validation from @xmath0-body integrations .",
    "one example is classic laplace - lagrange theory ( see chapter 7 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can fail to reproduce quantitative behaviour in exosystems when compared to @xmath0-body integrations , even when the theory is extended to fourth - order in eccentricity @xcite ; other types of extensions yield better results @xcite .",
    "another example is lidov - kozai theory , where differences in its quadrupole - order versus octupole - order accuracy are dramatically highlighted through comparison to @xmath0-body integrations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our purpose in this paper is to begin a series of investigations comparing long - term @xmath0-body integrations to _ periodic orbits _",
    ", which are defined in section 2 .",
    "@xcite also relate numerical integrations to periodic orbits , but carry out integrations for just 5 myr and perform a broad sweep of different period commensurabilities , rather than focusing on one , as we do here .",
    "periodic orbits can be treated as analytical tools which can gather information regarding a system s dynamics , such as in tbps .",
    "we herein implement the high predictive power of periodic orbits to explore the phase space of a system consisting of a wd , planet and massless asteroid where the planet and asteroid are evolving in or near a particular mmr .",
    "using periodic orbits to remove the guesswork involved in choosing initial conditions can reduce the phase space which needs to be explored and increase the relevance of the simulation suites that are run .",
    "we provide definitions and context in section 2 , the results of our numerical simulations in section 3 , a discussion in section 4 and our conclusion in section 5 .",
    "now we define a periodic orbit in the planar tbp along with other related , relevant terms . throughout this work , we will consider only coplanar systems ; lifting off this restriction would be a catalyst for future studies . in our tbp , the wd , planet and asteroid have masses of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and the asteroid is initially closer to the wd than the planet . in section 2.1 , we define periodic orbits .",
    "then we define the closely - related concept of mmr before linking the two in section 2.2 and finally focusing on the circular rtbp ( crtbp ) with a @xmath1:@xmath2 internal mmr in section 2.3 .",
    "consider a suitable frame of reference that is centred on the centre of mass of the wd and the planet and rotated , in order for the periodic orbits to be defined and the degrees of freedom to be subsequently reduced through the angular momentum integral ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "degrees of freedom are defined here as the set @xmath8 of positions and velocities of both the planet and asteroid .",
    "periodic orbit _ is a map @xmath9 , where the orbit s period @xmath10 satisfies @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is an integer .",
    "note that @xmath10 does not necessarily represent the orbital period of the planet nor the asteroid .",
    "given the resulting equations of motion , the system can remain invariant under certain transformations . as additional restrictions on this system are imposed , the number of degrees of freedom decreases .",
    "for example , the _ periodicity conditions _ will determine if the periodic orbit is classified as _",
    "symmetric _ or _",
    "asymmetric_. in the planar crtbp  where the asteroid is considered massless and the planet and wd are on circular orbits ",
    "the number of degrees of freedom for symmetric and asymmetric periodic orbits is only 2 and 3 , respectively ( see * ? ? ?",
    "a periodic orbit coincides with a fixed or periodic point on a poincar surface of section .",
    "this fixed point can be represented by a given set @xmath13 .",
    "this representation is the crucial link to initial conditions that supply periodic orbits with predictive power .",
    "then , through a process known as",
    "_ monoparametric continuation _",
    "( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these fixed points can be linked together .",
    "the result are smooth curves known as _ characteristic curves _ , or _",
    "families _ , of periodic orbits . in physical coordinate or orbital element phase space plots ,",
    "these smooth curves act as the visual manifestation of periodic orbits and provide deep insight into the tbp , illustrating where a three - body system may be stable , or not , over long timescales",
    ". in fact , periodic orbits can be classified as `` stable '' or `` unstable '' based on a linear stability analysis @xcite .",
    "an important property of stable symmetric periodic orbits is that the apsidal angle difference precesses about either @xmath14 ( _ alignment _ ) or @xmath15 ( _ anti - alignment _ ) .",
    "it still precesses for asymmetric periodic orbits , but about other angles .",
    "the resonant angles librate in a similar manner ( for details , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these angles rotate if the periodic orbits are unstable .",
    "the key goal of this work is to explore how this classification corresponds to the long - term stability of planet - asteroid systems .    in hamiltonian systems ,",
    "stable periodic orbits are surrounded by invariant tori in their neighbourhood in phase space , where the motion is regular and quasi - periodic . on the other hand ,",
    "homoclinic webs are formed in the vicinity of the unstable periodic orbits , which trigger chaotic motion . in the case of weak chaos ,",
    "the orbits evolve with some irregularity in the oscillations of orbital elements and a significant change in the configuration of the system is not apparent . if a system is located in strongly chaotic regions , it will eventually destabilize , exhibiting collisions or escape .",
    "thus , the long - term stability of a system can be guaranteed if it resides in a stability domain in phase space buttressed by families of stable periodic orbits .    here",
    ", we consider these periodic orbits in the context of long - term @xmath0-body simulations .          because periodic orbits rely on repeating configurations ,",
    "these orbits are intrinsically linked to mmrs .",
    "an mmr is a class of dynamical states .",
    "mmrs have been extensively invoked and studied ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the word _ commensurability _ is often used in a similar context with a similar definition , although the difference between a simple period ratio and the exact definition of resonance can have significant implications for the discovery and characterization of exoplanets @xcite",
    ".    direct mathematical definitions of mmrs sometimes start with the time derivative of an angle that appears in a gravitational disturbing function ( e.g. pg .",
    "331 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or a hamiltonian normal form expanded out to a finite perturbation order ( e.g. pg .",
    "57 of * ? ? ?",
    "the ability of a _ critical _ ( or _ resonant _ ) angle to _ librate _ ( or , oscillate ) rather than circulate is a hallmark of many definitions of resonance ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other definitions incorporate the trajectories in phase space between separatricies of a given integrable model . one fundamental problem with definitions that rely on the expansions ( of e.g. potentials in lagrange s planetary equations ) about particular values of orbital elements",
    "is that the order of the expansion represents a poor metric for accuracy and possibly convergence @xcite .",
    "one limitation of using librations in definitions of resonance is that a libration angle , centre , amplitude and timescale must _ all _ be defined @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a hamiltonian form defined by just a few small perturbation terms might necessitate constraining the ranges of orbital elements .",
    "periodic orbits and mmrs are linked through @xmath10 .",
    "the condition for a periodic orbit of period t to exist , @xmath9 , requires that an admissible value of @xmath10 is used .",
    "often , these values are associated to multiples of the orbital periods of the planet and asteroid such that the ratio of those multiples corresponds to an orbital period commensurability @xmath16 rational , @xmath17 being the order of the mmr ( e.g. @xmath1:@xmath2 , @xmath18:@xmath2 ) .    generally families of periodic orbits are generated by _",
    "bifurcation points_. however , there exist isolated families that do not bifurcate from periodic orbits of other families .",
    "additionally , some mmrs do not admit particular symmetries of periodic orbits .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite indicated that asymmetric periodic orbits do not exist in the crtbp in _ internal resonances _ ( where the asteroid is the inner body ) , but rather only in _ external resonances _ ( where the asteroid is the outer body ) .",
    "also , in the spatial tbp , spatial periodic orbits of a given mmr may correspond to _ inclination - type resonances _ @xcite as well as the more widely - studied _ eccentricity - type resonances_.      in this paper , we focus on the families of periodic orbits given by the internal @xmath1:@xmath2 resonance in the planar crtbp . for this commensurability and setup",
    ", one can find two symmetric periodic orbits through which monoparametric continuation will yield two different branches of families : one stable branch , and one unstable branch .",
    "the unstable branch contains two families ( see description below ) , and the stable branch contains one family , making a total of three families .",
    "the two branches correspond to different orbital architectures , i.e. when the asteroid is at pericentre ( @xmath19 ) or apocentre ( @xmath20 ) . in both cases , @xmath21 .",
    "the variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the asteroid s initial mean anomaly and argument of pericentre .",
    "examples of generation , survival ( see poincar - birkhoff theorem ) and continuation of families of periodic orbits from the unperturbed ( @xmath24 ) to the perturbed ( @xmath25 ) restricted case can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we can visualize these families with projections on the @xmath26 plane , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 refer to the initial semimajor axis and eccentricity of the asteroid , and @xmath29 is the initial semimajor axis of the planet .",

    "[ mapsea]a the branch corresponding to the initial location of the asteroid at apocentre is depicted .",
    "this branch is divided , via a region of close encounters between the planet and the asteroid , into two families ( separate white curves ) , which consist of unstable symmetric periodic orbits ( lower curve ) and stable symmetric periodic orbits ( upper curve ) .",
    "the curve in fig .",
    "[ mapsea]b is the branch of family of stable symmetric periodic orbits corresponding to the initial location of the asteroid at pericentre",

    "for example , the curves never reach @xmath32 ; a gap is formed during continuation from the unperturbed to perturbed case , because of the order of the resonance . for additional details , please see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    ".      plotted in the colourful background behind the lines are contours which indicate the lyapunov time , a measure of chaos in the system . specifically , the colour of each point of the plane indicates the logarithmic values of the detrended fast lyapunov indicator ( dfli ) ( fli divided by t ) @xcite defined as @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the deviation vectors of the orbit ( initially orthogonal ) computed after numerical integration of the variational equations of the system for @xmath35 years for each initial condition .",
    "these contours are not the result of full @xmath0-body integrations , but rather provide a quick and efficient representation of the phase space .",

    "consequently , collisions with the sun can occur through scattering interactions with multiple planets , leading to a much higher fraction of collisions than in our case @xcite . the presence of multiple planets does not , however , preclude the possibility of long - lived ( on gyr timescale ) stable  islands \" where asteroids can reside in or close to the @xmath1:@xmath2 mean motion resonance with jupiter @xcite .",
    "asteroids in such islands may also be shaped by radiation - based perturbations such as the yarkovsky effect @xcite , which can affect the long - term evolution @xcite in ways that are missed in the the planar crtbp studied herein .",
    "in contrast , extrasolar systems offer a wide variety of architectures , the majority of all known exosystems contain one exoplanet , leaving open the possibility of the rtbp being widely applicable outside of our solar system .",
    "individual asteroids are currently undetectable , except in wd systems , where their tidally - shorn innards are observed orbiting wds or accreting onto them .",
    "asteroids , comets and planets which orbit stars that leave the main sequence become subject to an assortment of important physical processes whose previous influence was negligible :    1 .   stellar mass loss , which causes an outward expansion and possible stretching and breaking of a bound osculating orbit @xcite 2 .   stellar radius enlargement , leading to engulfment or tidal disruption @xcite , 3 .   stellar wind drag , which usually acts in opposition to mass loss @xcite 4 .",
    "variations in stellar luminosity , which lead to yorp - induced fission @xcite , yarkovsky - induced dispersion @xcite , inward drag from radiation pressure and poynting - robertson effects @xcite and sublimation @xcite    these effects redistribute surviving bodies and debris in complex and still poorly - understood ways .",
    "regardless , observations reveal that this material somehow is frequently and significantly perturbed close to , and ultimately onto , the resulting wd .",
    "in fact planetary remnants are directly detected in the atmospheres of between one quarter and one half of all milky way wds @xcite .",
    "these signatures are referred to as _ pollution _ and are thought to arise from accretion from compact discs @xcite which are readily observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are thought to have formed by the tidal disruption of incoming planetary bodies @xcite , such as those disintegrating around wd 1145 + 017 @xcite .",
    "wd pollution reveals the chemical composition of the accreeted bodies @xcite and consequently provides unambiguous bulk density data about exoplanetary interiors .",
    "asteroids which pollute wds must be on highly eccentric orbits because in order to avoid engulfment during the giant branch ( gb ) stages of stellar evolution , the semimajor axis must be at least a few au . in order to be perturbed into highly eccentric orbits ,",
    "asteroids need instigators .",
    "three investigations @xcite have dynamically modelled the interaction of asteroids with one planet during the gb phases of evolution , as well as up to 1 gyr during the wd phase . @xcite",
    "considered the consequences of a perturbation by a wide orbit stellar companion , and @xcite determined how liberated moons would contribute to the dynamical architecture .",
    "however , none of those studies included simulations which incorporated the yarkovsky effect nor stellar wind drag ( although see section 5.1 of @xcite ) , which could represent the dominant drivers of asteroid evolution during the gb phase @xcite .",
    "therefore , how asteroids evolve during gb evolution , supposing they survive rotational spin - up @xcite , remains an open question , one that we do not address here .",
    "the rtbp is particularly relevant to these three studies .",
    "@xcite suggested that within the rtbp the eccentricity of an asteroid which resides near or inside of an mmr with a planet can gradually increase until the asteroid achieves a wd - grazing orbit .",
    "they performed simulations with one planet on an eccentric orbit ( @xmath110 ) and with asteroids that were inclined with respect to the star - planet plane ( j. debes , private communication ) in order to demonstrate their theory .",
    "@xcite later explicitly explored how the eccentricity of the planet affects collision rates with the wd when the asteroid was confined to within @xmath111 of the wd - planet plane .",
    "they found that @xmath112 is a necessary condition to pollute wds with a sufficiently high amount of material to extrapolate to observations .",
    "although the numerical simulations of both studies ran for up to only 1 gyr , our results affirm theirs and stringently rule out dynamical pollution mechanisms with a single planet on a circular orbit at the @xmath1:@xmath2 commensurability .",
    "the small inclinations adopted by @xcite suggests that the driver for collisions is planetary eccentricity rather than non - coplanarity .",
    "regardless , undertaking a systematic study for each of these orbital parameters  as well as different commensurabilities  is now required in order to pinpoint the most likely physical origin of long - timescale collisions with the wd .",
    "periodic orbits represent an effective tool for this purpose , especially since so many families have already been computed .",
    "we have evaluated the predictive power of periodic orbits and their phase space surroundings to determine the long - term ( 1 - 14 gyr ) stability of systems containing one star , one planet and one asteroid in the planar crtbp .",

    "our resource - consuming 14  gyr simulations revealed good agreement between the final dynamical outcome and the structure of phase space about the periodic orbits .",
    "consequently , researchers can use these orbits as broadly reliable guides to choose sets of initial conditions ( @xmath113 ) for @xmath0-body simulations to predict whether a given system will remain stable over the age of the universe .    of particular interest for gyr - old wds which",
