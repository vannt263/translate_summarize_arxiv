    "powerful radio sources are almost exclusively associated with giant elliptical galaxies , and appear to be in richer than average environments ( e.g.hill & lilly 1991 ) .",
    "this suggests that they should be more biased tracers of the mass distribution than normal galaxies .",
    "a study of the clustering of local ( @xmath2 ) radio galaxies by peacock & nicholson ( 1991 ) showed that this was indeed the case , with radio galaxies having a cross correlation function of the usual form ( assumed throughout this paper ) , @xmath4 , with a correlation length of @xmath5 mpc .",
    ", @xmath6 and @xmath7 throughout ] this can be compared to @xmath8mpc for normal galaxies ( loveday et al .",
    "1992 ) ; @xmath9 for iras - selected galaxies ( fisher et al .",
    "1994 ) , and @xmath10mpc for rich clusters of galaxies ( dalton et al .",
    "radio galaxies thus cluster with a strength intermediate between normal galaxies and clusters ( bahcall & chokshi 1992 ) . the associated cosmological bias factor is lower than for clusters , but about twice as high as that for iras - selected galaxies ( peacock & dodds 1994 ) .    studies of the angular correlation function of radio sources by magliocchetti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and cress & kamionkowski ( 1998 ) show that the data from radio surveys such as first are consistent with little evolution in the clustering amplitude in the range @xmath11 . however , these conclusions are based on extrapolating the luminosity functions of dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ; hereafter dp ) , to the faint flux densities near the limit of the first survey , @xmath12 mjy . at these levels",
    "the dp luminosity functions are constrained by source count data only , as direct redshift surveys were only available at @xmath13mjy .",
    "in particular , at faint flux levels the radio source population is a mix of nearby star - forming galaxies and agn - powered radio sources with a range in redshifts from 0 to @xmath144 ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) , which have quite different clustering properties .",
    "it is therefore important to test the results of the angular correlation function studies with direct measurements of clustering from radio galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "studies of the clustering of radio - quiet agn seem to show a generally similar correlation length , but there is a wide range in estimates of @xmath15 from different samples .",
    "this can probably be explained if the correlation function depends both on redshift and agn luminosity [ e.g.  sabbey et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , la franca , andreani & christiani ( 1998 ) ] .",
    "magliocchetti et al .  ( 1999 ) discuss theoretical predictions for the evolution of the two - point correlation function of radio sources .",
    "perhaps the most appropriate case to take is that where radio galaxies form at high redshift ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "we can trace the evolution of the host population out to @xmath17 , and find that the hosts vary little with redshift , apart from some passive evolution .",
    "the host magnitudes are also only weakly dependent on radio luminosity ( lacy , bunker & ridgway 2000 ) .",
    "hence uncertainties in the evolution in the bias factor are unlikely to be as important an issue for radio galaxies as they are for normal galaxies or radio - quiet quasars . fry ( 1996 )",
    "shows that in this `` galaxy conservation '' scenario , the bias factor increases with redshift according to @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the bias factor at the present epoch .",
    "this is because fluctuations in the galaxy density field are fixed at the epoch of formation , but the fluctuations in the matter density field grow with time .",
    "the decrease in the bias factor with time is mostly compensated for by the clustering of matter under gravity , for which the growth factor @xmath20 for an @xmath21 , @xmath22 cosmology .",
    "the two - point correlation function , @xmath23 , should therefore show little evolution .    to test this model , and to examine the nature of intermediate redshift superclusters",
    ", we therefore decided to begin a survey of large - scale structure at moderate redshifts ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this paper describes the initial result from this survey and also the prospects for future surveys .",
    "we tried to optimize the survey to detect supercluster - scale objects at @xmath25 .",
    "we therefore picked a point on the radio luminosity function where the space density of objects close to the flux limit would be @xmath26mpc@xmath27 , thus obtaining several objects in structures of linear sizes @xmath28 mpc .",
    "this corresponds to a radio luminosity of @xmath29 whz@xmath30sr@xmath30 , or a flux limit of @xmath31mjy at 1.4 ghz .",
    "this is comfortably above the completeness limits of the first and nvss radio surveys ( becker et al .",
    "1995 ; condon et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "initial selection was made from the nvss catalogue , each nvss source was examined in first to check for confusion , and to estimate the position of the identification .",
    "this technique combines the sensitivity to extended flux of the nvss survey with the positional accuracy of first .",
    "the sample discussed in this paper consists of 322 objects within right ascension and declination ranges of @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( an area of @xmath34 ) .",
    "identifications were made on the uk schmidt telescope plates using the cambridge apm .",
    "the plates were approximately calibrated onto @xmath35-band using ccd images of star fields close to each of the plate centres .",
    "initially , only the 34 objects classed as non - stellar in @xmath35 and with @xmath36 were considered for spectroscopy ( one of these turned out to be a misclassified high redshift quasar ) .",
    "six stellar objects were also selected later as checks on the apm classifier . for compact sources , or those with identifiable central components",
    "the probability of a chance misidentification is low . in the survey region",
    "the density of objects with @xmath36 is @xmath37 arcmin@xmath38 .",
    "the error on a first position is @xmath39 , so there is only an @xmath40% chance of a misidentification . for double sources with no central component , ( 18 out of 36 objects )",
    "the probability of a misidentification is larger . for these objects we followed the prescription of lacy et al .",
    "( 1993 ) by searching an ellipse with a major axis equal to the radio source size @xmath41 and minor axis of @xmath42 .",
    "the number of objects falling into the search region by chance , @xmath43 is given in table 1 , and is @xmath44 for all our objects , and @xmath45 for most of them .",
    "there are very unlikely to be any @xmath46 quasars in the sample  the fraction of quasars in complete samples drops rapidly at radio luminosities below @xmath47whz@xmath30sr@xmath30 ( willott et al .",

    "the plate calibration observations were made on the shane on 1999 september 15 .",

    "to measure the two - point correlation function simulated surveys were constructed with the same selection function as the original survey , but with randomly assigned coordinates .",

    "a least deviation fit to the @xmath51 relation for @xmath46 radio galaxies from the 8c - nec redshift survey ( lacy et al .",

    "the agreement with the predicted redshift distribution is good , with 28.7 objects predicted in the range @xmath0 compared to 29 observed . above @xmath55 , however , the predicted selection function and the observed redshift distribution diverge rapidly ( fig .  [ selfn ] ) , and of 47.5 objects predicted to be present in the redshift range @xmath56 , only 36 are found .",
    "this could be due either to the mistaking of high redshift galaxies for quasars by the apm classification program , a problem with the assumed luminosity function or a genuine underdense region .",
    "we next estimate the possible effect of incompleteness due to misclassification at @xmath57 .",
    "there are 12 objects within the survey selection criteria but with stellar identifications on the ukst plates for which spectra have not yet been obtained . with one exception",
    "all have radio morphologies more consistent with being quasars than galaxies ( i.e.  unresolved , triple or core - halo structures ) . of the 13 @xmath35 plate stellar identifications in the range @xmath58 for which we have spectra in this region of sky , from both this work and the first spectroscopic database , three are in fact galaxies , but only one is at @xmath57 .",

    "there is also a looser association at @xmath62 , and a group of three at @xmath63 .",
    "the sizes of the associations seem to be @xmath64 , comparable to low redshift superclusters .",
    "we have estimated the statistical significance of our detection of clustering in the complete @xmath0 sample ( median redshift @xmath48 ) by binning the distribution of pair separations in 10@xmath65 mpc bins , and comparing with the mean distribution obtained from 10000 monte - carlo simulations of the survey using a @xmath66 test .",
    "this gives the probability of our distribution arising by chance as @xmath67 ( @xmath68 with 53 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "however , a large part of the @xmath66 is contributed by the first bin which contains two pairs with separations @xmath69mpc . this is close enough that the members of each pair could be in the same galaxy cluster .",
    "we therefore removed these two from the first bin and recalculated the @xmath66 statistic , this gave a probability of 0.006 ( @xmath70 with 53 degrees of freedom ) .    to estimate the two - point correlation function ,",
    "the numbers of data - data ( dd ) , data - random ( dr ) and random - random ( rr ) pairs were measured from the data and the simulations and the two - point correlation function calculated according to the formula espoused by landy & szalay ( 1993 ) :    @xmath71    the results for the complete @xmath0 sample are shown in fig .",
    "the correlation function was fit over the range 0 - 100 @xmath65mpc , the best value for @xmath15 was @xmath72mpc , with a range of 524@xmath65mpc over which the probability of obtaining the @xmath66 was @xmath145 % ( assuming poisson errors ) .",
    "as a check on the effect of possible incompleteness we added three galaxies ( the largest number we expect based on the discussion above ) to the sample with redshifts drawn at random from the selection function , and with random sky positions within the survey region .",
    "this reduced @xmath15 to 14@xmath65mpc .",
    "incompleteness is thus unlikely to affect our estimate by more than the random error .",
    "we have succeeded in developing an effective method for studying the clustering of moderate redshift radio galaxies directly , and have detected clustering of radio galaxies at @xmath73 .",
    "the amplitude of the cross - correlation function we measure is consistent with that for radio galaxies locally .",
    "this is as expected in the simple model discussed in the introduction , in which radio source hosts evolve little with redshift , and is higher than that for normal galaxies at @xmath74 , for which small et al .",
    "( 1999 ) measure @xmath75 . at present , however , the small size of our survey prevents us ruling out all but the most extreme evolution in the correlation function .",
    "expansion of this survey to @xmath76 redshifts will allow a measurement of the two - point correlation function to be made which has comparable accuracy to that for normal galaxies at these redshifts .",
    "the relatively large volume probed by a larger survey will allow us to define a sample of superclusters and to examine their structures and the evolution of those structures to the present day .    the discovery of redshift clustering in deep pencil beam galaxy surveys , e.g. that of the hdf ( cohen et al .",
    "2000 ) has raised the possibility that large - scale structures continue to be present in the universe at least to @xmath3 .",
    "therefore the evolution of these structures should place interesting constraints on cosmology .",
