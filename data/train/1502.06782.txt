    "there is therefore particular interest in deterministic amplification schemes for these states , in addition to studying fundamental aspects of amplification . if moderate sized scss - large enough that the coherent states have little overlap , but small enough to prevent excessive decoherence by photon loss - can be produced and stablised , then fault - tolerant cv quantum computing is possible using linear optics only .",

    "the key benefits of this atom - assisted method are that ( a ) it is deterministic : atomic excited states can repeatedly be prepared by controlled microwave pulses and the core of the amplification operation is performed as a unitary generalised @xmath7 operation in the dressed representation of atomic and photonic states and ( b ) it does not require any specific loss engineering .",

    "this process requires the use of flux - tunable qubits . in realistic devices with multiple transmon levels",
    ", this sweeping must be performed slowly enough to prevent leakage of population to higher levels .",
    "the key element of our @xmath9 operation is an efficient state transfer from @xmath54 to @xmath100 which is performed on individual number states using @xmath76-type sets of levels .",

    "the fidelity of the protocol is reduced by kerr - type non - linearities in the dressed cavity , causing defects which accumulate over time .",

    "<S> we propose a dynamical scheme for deterministically amplifying photonic schrdinger cat states , based on a set of optimal state - transfer steps . </S>",
    "<S> perfect deterministic amplification of arbitrary coherent states is prohibited by quantum mechanics but determinism can be achieved by sacrificing either fidelity or amplification factor . our protocol is designed for strongly coupled circuit - quantum electrodynamics and utilises artificial atomic states and external microwave driving fields . in principle , high - fidelity amplification is possible with this protocol , while displaying a tradeoff between amplification and fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> we compare analytical results with full simulations of the open jaynes - cummings model with realistic device parameters compatible with the state of the art superconducting circuits . </S>",
    "<S> amplification with a fidelity of 0.9 can be achieved for moderate size schrdinger cat states in the presence of cavity and atomic - level decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> this amplification tool can be applied to practical quantum information processing with nonclassical continuous - variable states . </S>"
