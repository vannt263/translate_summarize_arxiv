    "one of the most exciting and fastest - growing fields of physics today is quantum information . especially since the discovery by shor @xcite that there exist calculations for which a quantum computer is apparently far more efficient than a classical computer , interest in understanding quantum information",
    "has increased at an impressive rate .",
    "one widely publicized discovery that has emerged from work in this field is teleportation @xcite . while not precisely equivalent to the process enjoying widespread fame amongst fans of star trek (  beam me up , scotty \" ) , the phenomenon referred to here is nonetheless fascinating , and perhaps even astonishing .",
    "the reason for the widespread publicity of this rigorously proven ( and experimentally tested @xcite , though not yet unambiguously demonstrated ) scientific prediction is almost certainly in large part due to the fact that it shares the same name as the just - mentioned , intriguing idea from science - fiction .",
    "the usual way of describing teleportation is through mathematical equations , and this mathematics is relatively straightforward , as has been amply demonstrated elsewhere @xcite .",
    "hence , an understanding of this phenomenon is accessible to physicists , other scientists , and those possessing a reasonably strong level of mathematical skill .",
    "there does , on the other hand , seem to be a good deal of misunderstanding of teleportation amongst non - scientists , with the notion floating around that the amazing phenomenon shown regularly in episodes of star trek  that is , of material objects being teleported from one place to another ",
    "has actually turned out to be possible in real life .",
    "nothing could be further from the truth , of course , so we are left wondering how to rectify this unfortunate state of affairs .",
    "the question i address here is the following : can the true ( scientific ) phenomenon of teleportation be understood by others , those without much skill in mathematics ?",
    "the usual explanations will certainly fail in this regard , even if carefully presented by a competent physicist , because mathematics has a well - known tendency to scare people away , and in any case , the mathematics of teleportation is not all _ that _ simple .",
    "the paper is addressed to physicists possessing a solid understanding of quantum physics ( including graduate students ) , with the aim to provide a method by which such a physicist can explain teleportation to someone who is not mathematically inclined .",
    "thus , the objective is ultimately , though indirectly , to educate the general public about teleportation , and by extension , quantum mechanics itself .",
    "the approach involves only the most basic ideas about quantum physics , and while it does not entirely avoid mathematical expressions , it uses only the simplest mathematics ( one only needs to accept that certain objects are either @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) and relies almost entirely on  pictures \" , allowing the layperson to visualize  and thus , understand  what is happening .    in the following sections ,",
    "i will describe my method of directly visualizing teleportation .",
    "these sections are written as if addressed to the layperson .",
    "the next section explains the probabilistic nature of quantum physics by considering  quantum coins \" , which are examples of two - level systems .",
    "this section describes how one should think about measurements , what is meant by probabilities for classical systems , and then how these ideas can be used to describe quantum systems .",
    "then , in section  [ vqip ] , i present my graphical approach to understanding the dynamics of quantum information processing , which is then used in section  [ tele ] to explain in pictures how teleportation of quantum states is possible .",
    "one of the crucial observations will be that a shared entangled state on , say , systems @xmath2 and @xmath3 , provides the parties with multiple  images \" of the state of an additional system @xmath4 .",
    "the ability to manipulate these images  independently by each party , and differently from one image to the next  is what allows teleportation to be accomplished .",
    "more generally , these ideas provide important insights into why entanglement is a valuable resource , as i have described in detail elsewhere , and they have been useful in understanding other aspects of quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most fundamental aspect of quantum theory is that it can only make predictions in terms of probabilities . in general",
    "even if one has a complete description of the state of a quantum system , one will not know ahead of time what the outcome of a given measurement will be .",
    "this is in direct contradiction with our everyday experience , which we refer to as  classical \" .",
    "for example , a flipped classical coin which lands heads (  heads \" is then a complete description of the state of this coin ) , is known with certainty to be heads , and also with certainty to _ not _ be tails .",
    "that is , if we know the state of a classical coin ( in this case",
    " heads \" ) , we can predict with certainty the answer to any reasonable question we choose to ask ( or  measure \" ) about that coin ( for example ,  is it tails ? \" ) . we therefore need to understand what is meant by the  state \" of a quantum system and how this state relates to probabilities and outcomes of measurements .",
    "the following definition of a measurement will be adequate for our purposes .",
    "* definition : * a _ measurement _ is a procedure that provides answers to a collection of yes - no questions , which is both mutually exclusive ( when the answer to one of the questions is  yes \" , the answer to all the others is  no \" ) and complete ( all possibilities are included ; that is , one of the questions will always be answered in the affirmative ) .",
    "the single question that receives the  yes \" answer is referred to as the _ outcome _ of the measurement .",
    "for example , since a classical coin is either heads or tails , and these two possibilities are mutually exclusive , a measurement on a classical coin is a procedure that answers the two questions  is it heads ? \" and  is it tails ? \"",
    "since the coin will always be one or the other , there will always be a  yes \" answer to one of these questions , and then the other question is always answered  no \" .",
    "hence these two questions do indeed constitute a measurement according to the above definition . if  is it heads ? \"",
    "is answered affirmatively , then  heads \" is the outcome of the measurement .",
    "it turns out that these two questions also constitute a measurement on quantum coins .",
    "however , in contrast to the classical case in which this is the _ only _ possible measurement , there is a vast array of possible measurements on quantum coins .",
    "this will become clearer from the discussion in the following sections , where we introduce a compact way of describing these things , a way commonly used in quantum mechanics .",
    "consider again a flipped classical coin .",
    "the coin lands either heads or tails",
    ". it will be useful to use a somewhat abbreviated notation : @xmath5 for heads and @xmath6 for tails .",
    "the statement that  if it is heads , it is not tails \" ( that is , has zero probability of being tails ) will be represented as @xmath7 the left - facing bracket @xmath5 represents the known initial state (  it is heads . \" ) and the right - facing bracket @xmath8 represents the question (  is it tails ? \" ) . the number ( @xmath0 ) appearing on the right - hand side of the equal sign then gives the probability that with this initial state , the answer to this question will be yes . for the above example",
    ", we have that the probability is @xmath0 , which is as expected since when the coin is @xmath9 it will never be @xmath10 .",
    "note that it is useful to use the left- and right - facing brackets , so that we can easily read off what is the initial state and what is the question being asked about it .",
    "simply writing @xmath11 in the above equation would lead to confusion when we discuss two coins ( see below ) , which might have an initial state where one is tails , the other heads , represented by @xmath12 .",
    "perhaps an even more trivial statement  if it is heads , then it is heads \" ( with certainty , or with probability one ) , will similarly be represented as @xmath13 again , the right - facing bracket contains the question @xmath14 , or ",
    "is it heads ? \" , and the fact that the expression is equal to @xmath1 indicates that the answer to this question will _ always _ be  yes \" when the initial state is @xmath15 .",
    "these statements are trivial because if we know the state of a classical coin , we can predict with certainty whether it will be heads or tails when we look at it .",
    "although the remaining equations will look a bit more involved , the only mathematics the reader need understand is contained in the above two equations , along with two others that are almost exactly the same . the discussion in the remainder of this paper will follow from the four simple statements , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "next let us consider two coins . in this case ,",
    "a complete list of mutually exclusive possibilities is @xmath20 .",
    "we can make statements in exactly the same way we did above , for example  if they are @xmath21 , then they are not @xmath22 \" , which in our notation is written @xmath23 where the subscripts ( @xmath24 ) have been inserted for clarity to indicate which coin is which .",
    "note that in this equation , we have equated the expression @xmath25 with the product of two expressions , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this is because any question about the two coins jointly is the same as two questions , one about each of the coins separately .",
    "it is obviously also true that  if they are @xmath21 , then they are @xmath21 \" , so @xmath28 for three coins , there are eight possibilities ( @xmath29 ) and the same notation will readily account for this case , as well .",
    "we will not need to consider more than three coins here , though it is in principle straightforward to do so .",
    "quantum coins behave very differently as compared to their classical counterparts , and quantum probabilities must be understood in very different ways .",
    "we still have heads and tails , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , as possible states of a quantum coin .",
    "we refer to these two states as being  orthogonal \" to each other , by which we simply mean that they are mutually exclusive : if the quantum coin is @xmath9 , it is definitely ( with certainty ) not @xmath10 , and vice - versa .",
    "we note that the four equations appearing in the previous section are equally true for both quantum and classical coins .",
    "however , there now exist some very strange possibilities .",
    "if i were to suggest that a classical coin can be both @xmath9 and @xmath10 at one and the same time , you would be completely justified in thinking i d gone slightly crazy .",
    "i am going to tell you , though , that at least in a certain ( though very real ) sense , this is the case for quantum coins ( though you may still wonder a bit about my sanity ) .",
    "the point is that , in the quantum case , it makes complete sense to ask questions such as :  if the coin is @xmath9 , is it half @xmath9 and half @xmath10 ? \" ; or we can turn this around and ask  if the coin is half @xmath9 and half @xmath10 , is it @xmath9 ? \"",
    "neither of these questions makes any sense whatsoever when referred to a classical coin . on the other hand , for a quantum coin",
    "these are not only legitimate questions , but they are in fact very important ones ( we do not consider the negligible possibility of a classical coin landing on its edge , and in any case this bears no relationship to what we mean by a quantum coin being half @xmath9 and half @xmath10 ) .    to represent these questions ,",
    "we can write the state ( @xmath30 ) of a quantum coin that is half @xmath9 and half @xmath10 as @xmath31 then the answer to the question ,  if the coin is half @xmath9 and half @xmath10 , is it @xmath9 ? \"",
    "is answered by the equation , @xmath32 which should be interpreted as meaning ",
    "yes , with probability @xmath33 \" , implying also  no , with probability @xmath34 \" [ in quantum mechanics , it is actually the square of the object on the left - hand side of the foregoing equation that represents the probability , rather than that object itself , which is known as the  probability amplitude \" ; however , although the difference between probabilities and probability amplitudes is crucial to the understanding of quantum mechanics , i have chosen in the present discussion to overlook this distinction for the benefit of the layperson to whom these ideas are aimed , as they would only serve to complicate matters , causing unnecessary confusion amongst the intended audience ] .",
    "the left - facing bracket @xmath35 represents the known initial state , and the right - facing bracket @xmath36 represents the question (  is it heads ? \" ) .",
    "the number @xmath33 appearing on the right - hand side of the last line then gives the probability that with this initial state , the answer to this question will be yes .",
    "the point to understand here is that even though we have a complete description ( @xmath30 ) of the state of the quantum coin , we do not generally know in advance whether the coin will be @xmath9 or @xmath10 when we look at it .",
    "we can only predict in terms of probabilities : if we perform this experiment many times , half the time the answer will be yes and the other half of the time it will be no . furthermore , there are many more questions we can ask in the quantum , as compared to the classical , case .",
    "we are no longer restricted to asking  is the coin @xmath9 ? \" or  is it @xmath10 ? \" , but we can ask other questions , such as the reverse of the question we just answered , @xmath37 we see that the question  if the coin is @xmath9 , is it half @xmath9 and half @xmath10 ? \" has the same answer as the previous question :  yes , with probability @xmath33 ; and no , with probability @xmath38 \"    we note that in the remainder of the paper , instead of phrasing questions as  is the coin half @xmath9 and half @xmath10 ? \" , we instead ask whether it is  equal parts \" @xmath9 and @xmath10 . while there is no real difference between these two questions , this rephrasing allows us to simplify the notation by dispensing with the factors of @xmath33 that have appeared in the above discussion . in doing so",
    ", the equations will not yield the same numbers as probabilities for the various questions , but this will not hamper the presentation since the numerical values of the probabilities are not crucial to the ideas we wish to convey : we just need to remember that certain objects are equal to @xmath1 and others are equal to @xmath0 .",
    "what exactly do we mean by teleportation in the context of quantum information ?",
    "it is not a material object that is being teleported , but rather the state of a quantum system .",
    "we will assume that the system is a quantum coin , with a complete set of mutually exclusive ( orthogonal ) states being  heads \" and  tails \" , which we may denote as @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "suppose alice and bob are physicists in locations widely separated from each other .",
    "they each have a quantum coin  labeled @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively  and these two coins are in the state @xmath39 where the subscripts used here refer to system _ a _ ( _ b _ ) in alice s ( bob s ) possession .",
    "this state of two quantum coins has a very strange property , which is known as entanglement , and the state itself is an example of a maximally entangled state .",
    "entanglement is a rather strange sort of correlation between quantum systems , which manifests itself in the state @xmath40 by the fact that neither system _ a _ nor _ b _ can be considered to have a definite  state of its own \" independent of the other system : whatever is the state of coin @xmath2 , coin @xmath3 will have the same state , but one can not say anything about the state of either coin independent of the other one . it is this property of entanglement that is credited with enabling alice and bob to accomplish teleportation .",
    "alice is given another coin ( system _ a _ ) , prepared in a state @xmath41 with arbitrary coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 that are completely unknown to her and to bob .",
    "if @xmath44 and @xmath45 , we have the case discussed in the previous section , where the coin is equally likely to be found to be @xmath9 or @xmath10 . for other values of these coefficients , the two possibilities will in general not be equally likely .",
    "alice s task is to perform operations on the systems in her possession ( _ a _ and _ a _ ) in such a way that bob will end up with his system ( _ b _ ) in precisely the state @xmath46 , which is the same state as @xmath47 , but now on the distant system _ b_. it turns out that this task can be accomplished if alice communicates information to bob ( perhaps via a telephone ) about what she ended up doing to her systems , after which bob performs a rather simple quantum operation , dependent on the information obtained from alice , on system _ b_.    an important point to understand in what follows is that nothing either of them does in this process provides even the slightest information about the coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 , so the state ( @xmath48 ) that has been teleported remains completely unknown to the parties .",
    "this aspect of teleportation becomes even more amazing if one considers the amount of information that is conveyed : the information contained in a quantum state is far greater than the amount actually transmitted from alice to bob via the telephone ( as we will see below , the amount transmitted via the telephone is two classical bits , enough to convey which one of four possibilities has been chosen ) .",
    "true , the @xmath49 information one can encode in a two - level quantum system can not exceed one bit ( one bit is the amount of information needed to choose between two possibilities , such as @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "but if alice wanted to tell bob how to create the state in his own lab by communicating with him over a phone line , this would require an @xmath50 amount of classical information ; that is , enough information to completely describe the arbitrary numbers , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( it is infinite because one of these numbers might well be an irrational number such as @xmath51 , having a decimal expansion that is unending , never repeating itself ) . of course , alice and bob are both",
    "completely ignorant _ of what these numbers are , so even if it were possible to transmit an infinite amount of information , they do nt even know what information they would need to send !",
    "nonetheless , when they share entanglement , it is possible for the two of them , by working together , to create the unknown state on bob s coin @xmath3 with the communication of only two classical bits .",
    "let us now introduce the pictorial method which will be used to visualize teleportation .",
    "the simple diagrams we will use to depict states of multiple quantum coins , held by two different parties , are familiar to many researchers working in quantum information .",
    "we will now illustrate how these diagrams are used to represent quantum states , and then how they can be used to follow what happens to these coins when measurements are performed by one of the parties .",
    "then , we will be ready to use them for visualizing teleportation .      to depict the state of a single quantum coin labeled @xmath4 ( standing for alice",
    "; she will also have the other coin labeled @xmath2 , while bob s single coin is labeled @xmath3 ) , we may use a simple box diagram , @xmath52 the coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 appearing in the boxes indicate  how much \" is in that part of the state @xmath53 of coin @xmath4 .",
    "the next example illustrates the case where there are two coins ( @xmath4 and @xmath3 ) held by two different parties .",
    "then , the state of these two coins might be @xmath54 with @xmath53 as given above .",
    "the empty squares on the right - hand side of this diagram represent the fact that system _ b _ is  not @xmath10 \" ( has zero probability of being tails ) ; the @xmath42 in the upper - left corner represents the probability the coins are both heads ; and the @xmath43 in the lower - left , the probability bob s coin is heads and alice s is tails .    if there are three parties involved , a three - dimensional cube could be used to represent this situation .",
    "however , it will serve our present purposes to represent both of alice s systems along the vertical dimension of the diagram .",
    "we might have coins @xmath4 and @xmath3 as in the previous example , and coin @xmath2 being heads , the overall state of these three coins represented as @xmath55 if instead the _ a , b _ systems are both @xmath10 , this picture is @xmath56 now consider what happens if we add the previous two equations together .",
    "then our two coins _ a , b _ are  equal parts in @xmath21 and in @xmath57 \" , which is what we previously referred to as the  maximally entangled state \" @xmath58 .",
    "the corresponding diagram looks like @xmath59 notice how there are now two images of the state @xmath47 .",
    "this observation turns out to be rather useful in understanding entanglement @xcite , but we will not need to discuss such issues here .",
    "let us now look at how to represent measurements by use of these diagrams .",
    "suppose alice and bob share three quantum coins in the state represented in the last equation of the previous section , and alice wants to know something about her coins .",
    "if she measures coin @xmath2 and discovers it is @xmath9 , then we have @xmath60 recall that when the right - facing bracket @xmath61 is attached to the left - facing one @xmath62 on the left of this equation , we get @xmath63 , which  preserves \" the upper row , whereas @xmath64 , indicating that the bottom row is annihilated ( multiplied by @xmath0 ) , which is why it no longer appears on the far right of this equation . the interpretation is as follows : when the question  is coin @xmath2 heads ? \"",
    "is answered in the affirmative the other coins are left in the state @xmath65 .",
    "we see how this measurement acts on _ both _ of the images simultaneously , rather than on the two independently . the upper - left image has been preserved intact , but the other image was annihilated , disappearing altogether .",
    "on the other hand , if the outcome of alice s measurement had been that coin @xmath2 was @xmath10 , this would be represented as @xmath66 in this case , the upper - left image has disappeared and the one in the lower - right has been preserved intact . in each of these cases ,",
    "the state of coin @xmath4 is unchanged , but that of coin @xmath3 is left in a state that corresponds directly to the outcome of alice s measurement on @xmath2 . if she discovers that coin @xmath2 was @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) , then coin @xmath3 ends up @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) .",
    "alternatively , she could do a measurement that includes the question  is coin @xmath2 equal parts @xmath9 and @xmath10 ? \"",
    "if the answer to this question is yes , then @xmath67 which is just a sum of the previous two equations ( notice how after each of the three measurement outcomes we have just considered , the two images have been collapsed into a single row ) .",
    "once again we see that the state of coin @xmath3 ends up corresponding to the outcome of alice s measurement on coin @xmath2 .",
    "this illustrates some of the strangeness that resides in entangled states of quantum systems : no matter what measurement alice makes on coin @xmath2 and no matter what outcome she obtains from that measurement , the resulting state of coin @xmath3 will correspond directly to that outcome .",
    "the way the images of @xmath53 appear in the diagram is crucial .",
    "the fact that the two start out in different rows _ and _ in different columns will be important in what is to come . if entanglement between systems _ a , b _ was absent , for example if they were in the ( unentangled ) state @xmath68 , then this would be represented by ( recall that @xmath69 ) @xmath70 under these circumstances , bob s view of the lower image of @xmath53 is  obstructed \" by the presence of the upper image ; the two images effectively appear as one to him . as will become clear in the following section , the presence of entanglement between the _ a",
    ", b _ coins will be necessary for them to accomplish teleportation .",
    "we will see that it is bob s ( and alice s ) ability to  see \" the two images separately , and the consequent ability for each of them to act _ differently _ on one of the images as compared to the other , that is crucial to their success .    in the next section",
    ", we turn to the task of teleporting the state @xmath53 onto bob s coin @xmath3 . to begin this process",
    ", alice will perform a measurement that asks ",
    "joint \" questions ; that is , questions about both coins in her possession simultaneously . as an example",
    ", she could ask if they are both @xmath9 .",
    "that is ,    @xmath71    the @xmath42 appearing in the box on the right corresponds to the probability that the answer to this question will be  yes \" . more important for our purposes",
    "is to recognize that when this is the outcome of the measurement , coin @xmath3 ends up @xmath9 , once again a consequence of the initial entanglement between coins @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "now let us see how teleportation is possible .",
    "teleportation is accomplished with the aid of the extra systems @xmath72 in the entangled state @xmath73 .",
    "system @xmath4 starts in state @xmath47 , discussed above , and this is the state they will teleport .",
    "alice will ask a set of joint questions , which together constitute a measurement , about the state of the two coins in her possession , @xmath2 and @xmath4 . the first question she asks is whether these two coins are equal parts @xmath21 and @xmath57 .",
    "when the answer is yes , we have    @xmath74    notice how the middle two rows are annihilated by this outcome ( because these rows correspond to a situation where the two coins are different  one @xmath9 and one @xmath10  whereas we are asking if they are the same ) , and the remaining rows are collapsed into a single row .",
    "now , if we look carefully ( or perhaps , not even so carefully ) at the final diagram in this picture , we will arrive at a rather startling conclusion .",
    "we see that the state of bob s system _ b _ is now @xmath75 . that is , the unknown state @xmath47 , originally on system _ a _ , is now on bob s system _ b_. furthermore , the question asked by alice had nothing whatsoever to do with the coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which determine what the original state of coin @xmath4 was .",
    "hence , the parties remain completely ignorant of the state @xmath48 , yet that state has been successfully teleported !",
    "we are not quite finished , however , since we would like for alice and bob to be able to teleport no matter which joint question ends up being the outcome of alice s measurement . because of the probabilistic nature of the quantum world",
    ", she can not choose the outcome of her measurement .",
    "instead , alice effectively asks all of the questions in her chosen measurement and then must wait for nature to decide which question she ( nature , that is ) will choose as the outcome .",
    "the nice thing about nature is that she will tell alice which question was chosen",
    ".    there must be four questions in a complete set of questions making up a joint measurement on coins @xmath76 .",
    "let me illustrate with one other question how alice and bob can succeed with teleportation , and then the reader is asked to believe that they can also succeed with either of the remaining two questions ( these can be treated in a very similar way to the one shown here @xcite ) .",
    "the second question is : are coins @xmath76 equal parts @xmath77 and @xmath22 ?",
    "the corresponding diagram is    @xmath78    here , the first and last rows are annihilated by this outcome , and the middle two are collapsed into a single row .",
    "looking at the final diagram , we see that coin @xmath3 is left in the state @xmath79 , which has the coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 exchanged in comparison to the state @xmath48 that we want it to be in .",
    "however , alice knows that this is the question to which nature answered yes , and she can call bob on the telephone and inform him of this fact . once he knows this is the question that was answered affirmatively , all he needs to do is  flip his quantum coin \" . recall that this is a quantum coin , which he can not simply pick up and turn over .",
    "instead what we mean by this is that he exchanges @xmath9 for @xmath10 and vice - versa . in",
    "turns out that this is a legitimate action that can be performed on a quantum coin , and it will leave coin @xmath3 in the desired state : @xmath80 . notice also that they again remain completely ignorant of the coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43  nothing that has happened has provided them with any such information , nor have they needed it .",
    "it turns out that no matter which of the four outcomes of alice s measurement she obtains , once she informs bob of that outcome , he will be able to perform a legitimate action on his quantum coin that will leave his coin in the state @xmath46 .",
    "all bob needs to know , in order to choose which action to perform , is the outcome of alice s measurement : alice needs only to send him two bits of information , enough to choose between one of the four possible outcomes .",
    "furthermore , none of the four outcomes provides either party with any information about the coefficients , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , so they both remain completely ignorant of the original state they have just successfully teleported .",
    "the diagrams provide a great deal of insight into what is going on .",
    "the crucial observation is the presence of two images of the state @xmath48 , resulting from the entanglement between coins @xmath72 .",
    "alice does a measurement that , while not acting independently on these two images , does act _ differently _ on them , as we alluded to above .",
    "this measurement picks out _ different _ parts of @xmath48 from the different images in a way such that all of @xmath48 is preserved and none of it is repeated .",
    "for example , in the previous example , the @xmath9 part is preserved from the lower - right image , and the @xmath10 part from the upper - left one ( and vice - versa in the example before that ) .",
    "this suggests ( and it is indeed the case ) that for coins that have more than two sides ( a six - sided quantum die , for example ) , the parties can teleport the state of such an @xmath81-sided coin by sharing a maximally - entangled state that is  large enough \" to provide them with @xmath81 images of the unknown state @xmath48 .",
    "then alice can design her measurement such that _ for each outcome _ : ( 1 ) a different part of @xmath48 is extracted from each image ; and ( 2 ) the whole state is preserved across the @xmath81 images .",
    "afterward , bob can recover the state simply by rearranging the various parts , which he will be able to do once alice informs him of the outcome of her measurement .",
    "alice s measurement does not provide them with any information about the original state they are attempting to teleport , nor does bob s rearrangement require that they know anything about it . in all cases ,",
    "they remain ignorant of the state they are teleporting .",
    "the reader is encouraged to draw a diagram ( perhaps for coins with @xmath82 sides each ; see the following paragraph ) and follow through the argument to be sure it is clear how this is done .",
    "the diagram will have @xmath83 horizontal rows ( representing alice s two @xmath81-sided coins @xmath76 , each row corresponding to one of the combinations of sides of these two coins : @xmath84 , where @xmath85 label the various sides ) , and @xmath81 vertical columns ( representing bob s coin @xmath3 ) .    a complete measurement for the @xmath82 case will include @xmath86 outcomes , but an essentially complete understanding can be gained if the reader considers only the three outcomes corresponding to ( 1 ) @xmath87 ; ( 2 ) @xmath88 ; and ( 3 ) @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the third side of these coins ( the other six outcomes involve additional complications that i have not explained here , but these outcomes are not crucial for the general kind of understanding we are aiming for here ) . in this case",
    "the appropriate generalization of @xmath40 is the state @xmath91 , and the three terms in this expression yield the three images needed for teleportation .",
    "in this section , i consider teleportation of classical coins , which turns out to be possible using a method that bears a striking resemblance to the method used for quantum coins .",
    "imagine that chloe prepares a classical coin ( labeled @xmath4 ) as either @xmath9 or @xmath10 , and gives it to alice , who is not allowed to look at the coin .",
    "chloe also prepares classical coins @xmath2 and @xmath3 such that they are either @xmath21 ( both @xmath9 ) or @xmath57 ( both @xmath10 ) .",
    "she then gives coin @xmath2 to alice and coin @xmath3 to bob , but again does not allow these parties to look at their coins .",
    "alice now asks chloe the following two questions : are coins @xmath4 and @xmath2 the same ? or are they different ?",
    "this pair of  yes - no \" questions represents a measurement , as defined earlier , on this pair of coins .",
    "if chloe informs her they are the same , then alice knows that coin @xmath3 , which is guaranteed to be the same as @xmath2 , is also the same as @xmath4 ; if , on the other hand , chloe says coins @xmath4 and @xmath2 are different , then coin @xmath3 is also different from @xmath4 .",
    "alice now calls bob on the telephone and tells him to  flip \" or  do nt flip \" . in the first case ( @xmath4 same as @xmath2 )",
    "she tells him not to flip , while when @xmath4 and @xmath2 are different , she tells him to flip .",
    "after he follows her instruction , bob s coin @xmath3 will with certainty match coin @xmath4 .",
    "the state of coin @xmath4 has been teleported onto coin @xmath3 .",
    "it is instructive to look at why the quantum case is astonishing while the classical one is rather mundane .",
    "there are three important differences between classical and quantum teleportation .",
    "the first difference has to do with the information that alice would need to transmit to bob in order to inform him of the state of coin @xmath4 , if she happened to know that state . for a classical coin ,",
    "there are only two possibilities , @xmath9 or @xmath10 , so she would need to transmit only one bit to bob .",
    "this is the same amount of information that is actually transmitted when she tells him  flip \" or  do nt flip \"  again , two possibilities .",
    "in contrast , as was discussed at the beginning of section  [ vqip ] for the case of quantum coins , it would require an _",
    "infinite _ amount of information for alice to inform bob of the state of coin @xmath4 , whereas she only actually transmits two bits of information when informing him which of her four questions was the outcome of her measurement .",
    "we see that the two cases , classical vs. quantum , are dramatically different in terms of the amounts of information involved .",
    "the second difference between these two cases is a bit more subtle . in the classical case ,",
    "if alice were to cheat and actually look at coin @xmath4 , she would automatically know what state that coin is in and be able to tell bob what to do with his coin  turn it @xmath9 or turn it @xmath10 ; another one - bit message encompassing these two possibilities .",
    "this absolutely will not work for a quantum coin , which alice can not simply  look \" at to discover its state .",
    "the reason is the following : to begin with , in contrast to a classical coin , when alice looks at her quantum coin , she invariably disturbs it in the process . that is ,",
    "no matter what state the coin was in before she looked at it , the state after she looks at it is with certainty given by the outcome of her measurement .",
    "for example , even if the state is ",
    "equal parts @xmath9 and @xmath10 \" before she asks if it is @xmath9 or @xmath10 , if the answer is @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , then the coin is now @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) . or if it is @xmath9 to begin with and she does a measurement that answers yes to the question  is it equal parts @xmath9 and @xmath10 ? \" ,",
    "then the state of the coin will now be equal parts @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "hence , when she looks at it , she will get one of two answers ( those being the two possible outcomes of her measurement ) as to the state of the coin , but if she looks at it _ wrong _",
    ", that answer will not tell her _ what the state was beforehand _ , but only what it is now . furthermore , since she has now disturbed the state , there is no way to go back and try again , since the coin is now in a completely different state than the one she is trying to discover .",
    "the moral of this story is twofold : with quantum coins ( 1 ) do nt bother trying to cheat ; and ( 2 ) there s no point in asking for a  do - over \" .",
    "the third difference between the quantum and classical cases is even more subtle and is related to entanglement , for which there is no counterpart with classical coins . for classical teleportation",
    ", chloe must tell alice whether or not coins @xmath92 are the same or different . when these coins are classical , and since chloe is the one that prepared them , she is certainly able to do so .",
    "however , in the quantum case coins @xmath72 are entangled , which means that neither one has a definite state of its own . since coin @xmath2",
    "does not have a definite state , the question whether coins @xmath92 are the same ( have the same state ) _ has no answer _ ! even if we assume that chloe prepared coins @xmath72 in their entangled state , there is nothing whatsoever that she ( or anyone else ) can say about the state of coin @xmath2 , except that it is entangled with @xmath3 and has no definite state of its own .",
    "it is worth noting that in both the quantum and classical cases , coins @xmath72 are correlated with each other in ways that at first glance appear to be very similar  when one is measured and found to be @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , the other one will also be @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "nonetheless , the correlations present in the entangled state @xmath40 of quantum coins @xmath72 have _ no analog _ in the case of classical coins .",
    "one reason is precisely what we have just discussed : that the quantum coins can be correlated in this way even though neither of the individual coins has a definite state of its own ( a classical coin _ always _ has a definite state of its own ) .",
    "i have described a novel way to visualize the processing of quantum information , and used this picture to give a simple way to  see \" how teleportation is possible .",
    "the picture turns out to be useful beyond just providing an understanding of previously known phenomena ( teleportation ) , however .",
    "indeed , it has given us a deeper understanding of the process of deterministically implementing non - local unitaries by local operations and classical communication ( when shared entanglement is available as a resource ) , allowing us to construct new protocols @xcite that go far beyond what was previously known to be possible @xcite .",
    "we have also used this picture to study the question of what entanglement resources are required to locally implement other non - local operations , such as measurement protocols for the purpose of distinguishing sets of quantum states that are indistinguishable without the extra entangled resource @xcite .",
    "the other two questions involve minus signs and are represented as ( 3 ) @xmath93 and ( 4 ) @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "multiplying one or the other of the states @xmath9 and @xmath10 by a minus sign is another valid quantum operation , which bob can perform on his coin . by doing so",
    ", he effectively turns each of these cases into one of the two already shown explicitly in the paper .",
    "when question ( 3 ) is answered affirmatively , multiplication of @xmath95 by the minus sign is all that is needed to complete the teleportation ; and for question ( 4 ) , the minus sign operation need only be followed by bob flipping his quantum coin ."
