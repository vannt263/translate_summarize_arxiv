    "rayleigh - bnard convection ( rbc )  @xcite , where a thin horizontal layer of fluid is heated from below , is a topic of intense research .",
    "a particularly interesting variation of rbc is the case in which a low - prandtl - number fluid is subjected to a magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the system , also known as hydromagnetic convection , is relevant for several geophysical and astrophysical problems  @xcite .",
    "there have been extensive theoretical and numerical studies of rbc in fluids in the presence of an external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "they have addressed interesting issues such as pattern selection and instability  @xcite , heat transport  @xcite , and flow reversal  @xcite .",
    "it is widely known that a uniform magnetic field tends to suppress the onset of convection , significantly reduces the convective heat transport across the fluid layer , and affects the primary as well as secondary instabilities  @xcite .",
    "experiments  @xcite show that the scaling exponent of the nusselt number @xmath3 , which is a measure of the convective heat flux across the fluid layer , with the rayleigh number @xmath4 depends on the chandrasekhar number @xmath7 .",
    "the numerical simulations  @xcite have mainly focused on investigating the stability of fluid patterns near primary instability . a systematic study of the convective flow structures and the scaling behavior even close to the onset of convection is lacking .    in this paper , we present the results of direct numerical simulations ( dns ) for rbc in low - prandtl number fluids ( @xmath18 ) in the presence of small uniform vertical magnetic field ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "we have carried out the simulations in a three dimensional box ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "we have considered boxes of square ( @xmath21 ) and rectangular ( @xmath22 ) cross sections in the horizontal plane .",
    "straight stationary rolls appear at the primary instability .",
    "the stationary straight rolls persist for higher values of @xmath4 and moderate values of @xmath7 . @xmath3",
    "scales with @xmath23/\\mathrm{ra_c(q)}$ ] as @xmath24 very close to the primary instability . the range of scaling expands with increase in @xmath7 .",
    "the nusselt number also scales with @xmath8 as @xmath25 with @xmath26 for @xmath12 , which is consistent with the experimental results  @xcite .",
    "the secondary instability is always in the form of quasiperiodic or periodic waves along the roll axis in a square box .",
    "the secondary instability leads to periodic waves in a rectangular box .",
    "the patterns of straight stationary rolls , wavy rolls , quasi - periodic and chaotic wavy rolls and stationary oblique rolls are observed , as @xmath4 is raised at a given value of @xmath7 .",
    "we consider a thin layer of a low - prandtl - number boussinesq fluid of a reference density @xmath27 , kinematic viscosity @xmath28 , thermal diffusivity @xmath29 , magnetic diffusivity @xmath30 , and thermal expansion coefficient @xmath31 , which is confined between two horizontal surfaces separated by a distance @xmath32 . the fluid layer is subjected to an adverse temperature gradient @xmath33 and a uniform vertical magnetic field @xmath34 .",
    "a coordinate system is chosen such that the lower fluid surface is coincident with the @xmath35 plane .",
    "the @xmath36 axis is positive along the vertically upward direction , which is also the direction of the applied magnetic field .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations are made dimensionless by measuring lengths in units of the fluid thickness @xmath32 , time in units of viscous diffusion time @xmath37 , temperature in units of @xmath38 , and the magnetic field in units of @xmath39 . as the magnetic prandtl number @xmath40 is usually of the order @xmath41 or less for terrestrial fluids , we set @xmath42 equal to zero .",
    "the dynamics of rbc in the presence of a uniform vertical magnetic field is then governed by the following set of dimensionless equations :    @xmath43 = \\nabla^2\\theta + { v}_3,\\label{temp}\\\\ & \\nabla^2\\mathbf{b}=-\\partial_z\\mathbf{v},\\label{mag}\\\\ & \\mathbf{\\nabla}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}=0,\\label{other}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath44 is the fluid pressure due to convection , @xmath45 is the fluid velocity , @xmath46 is the convective temperature field , @xmath47 is the induced magnetic field due to convection , and @xmath48 is a unit vector directed in the positive direction of the @xmath36 axis .",
    "the induced magnetic field is slaved to the velocity in the limit of @xmath49 , and there is no independent dynamics for @xmath50 field .",
    "the dynamics of rbc in the presence of a uniform vertical magnetic field is then governed by three dimensionless parameters : ( i ) prandtl number @xmath51 , which is the ratio of kinematic viscosity @xmath28 and thermal diffusivity @xmath29 , ( ii ) rayleigh number @xmath52 , and ( iii ) chandrasekhar number @xmath53 .",
    "we assume idealized _ stress - free _ boundary conditions at the upper and lower surfaces , which may be a more useful approximation on a boundary between two liquids with a large difference in their viscosities .",
    "almost stress - free boundary conditions were achieved in experiments by goldstein and graham  @xcite .",

    "we have taken @xmath84 for the case of square cross - section , while @xmath85 and @xmath86 for the case of rectangular cross - section .",
    "this allows us to investigate the interaction of two dimensional ( 2d ) stationary straight rolls ( rolls ) with a new set of rolls aligned perpendicular to the old set .",

    "the convection sets in as stationary straight rolls at the primary instability .",
    "the vertical magnetic field delays the onset of convection , which is well known since the prediction of chandrasekhar  @xcite .",
    "it is clearly evident that the secondary instability , which is oscillatory , is strongly inhibited due to the presence of a vertical magnetic field .",
    "figures  [ fig : k_phi](a ) and ( b ) show the variation of @xmath95 and @xmath96 with @xmath97 for @xmath98 and three different values of @xmath7 .",
    "the kinetic energy is proportional to @xmath97 in the stationary convection regime .",
    "the deviation from this behavior is observed when there is a transition from stationary to oscillatory convection .",
    "away from the onset of secondary ( oscillatory ) instability , @xmath95 is again approximately proportional to @xmath97 . the average flow speed scales with @xmath97 as @xmath99 near onset .",

    "the average convective temperature field therefore scales as @xmath101 .",
    "the scaling of the average convective temperature field is different from that of the average speed .",
    "as soon as convection begins , there is advection of the temperature field and a thermal current is established in the vertical direction .",
    "a part of the thermal energy injected externally is used in maintaining the thermal flux .",
    "this is also reflected by two types of possible temperature modes @xmath102 ( @xmath103 or @xmath104 and @xmath105 ) and @xmath106 .",
    "the modes @xmath102 have zero horizontal average and they scale like velocity modes @xmath107 .",
    "the temperature modes @xmath108 do not have a counterpart in the expansion for the vertical velocity as there is no net momentum flux in the vertical direction . only in the limit of @xmath109",
    "would the convective thermal flux vanish and the temperature field follow the vertical velocity field .",
    "the nusselt number defined as @xmath110 is a measure of the heat flux across the fluid layer .",
    "the symbol @xmath111 stands for the spatial average over the simulation box .",
    "the variation of the time averaged value of ( @xmath112 ) is plotted as a function of @xmath97 in fig .",
    "[ fig : nusselt ] for @xmath98 at different values of @xmath7 .",

    "the product @xmath114 scales as @xmath115 , if we take @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "this estimate is not accurate .",
    "the convective heat flux is proportional to @xmath118 , and therefore all temperature modes do not contribute to the heat flux .",
    "this feature in the scaling of heat transport should be observable in other variations of a rayleigh - bnard system . the scaling exponent for variation of the nusselt number with @xmath97 may depend on the details of a particular system but it is expected to be less than unity .",
    "the increase of the nusselt number with @xmath97 is stopped at the onset of oscillatory instability .",
    "it first decreases , reaches a minimum , and then begins to increases once again , as @xmath97 is raised in small steps .",
    "solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : nusselt ] display the variation of @xmath3 with @xmath97 from numerical data obtained by clever and busse  @xcite for no - slip horizontal boundaries .",
    "the slope of the heat flux across the fluid layer during stationary convection and much after the onset of oscillatory convection with free - slip and no - slip boundary conditions shows qualitatively similar behavior , although the actual value of @xmath3 with free - slip is higher than its value with no - slip velocity boundary conditions . the convective heat transport for stationary convection scales with @xmath97 as @xmath24 near the primary instability for moderate values of @xmath7 . for higher values of @xmath7 ( @xmath119 ) ,",
    "the scaling exponent decreases at relatively higher values of @xmath97 .",
    "the scaling law is broken at onset of the oscillatory convection .",
    "however , the @xmath120 curves with free - slip and no - slip conditions show similar slopes for higher values of @xmath97 . the slope of any @xmath120 curve for time - dependent convection is smaller than its value for stationary convection .",
    "the scaling exponent of @xmath3 is slightly less than unity for smaller values of @xmath4 , which is expected even in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "the scaling exponent is likely to be dominated by the buoyancy force at much higher values of @xmath4 , and is therefore expected to be independent of @xmath7 for @xmath121 ( fully developed turbulent regime ) .",
    "one expects an intermediate regime where the lorentz force as well as the force of buoyancy together may decide the scaling exponent , if a scaling behavior is possible .",
    "we have therefore tried to probe the possibility of a scaling regime by plotting @xmath3 as a function of @xmath8 .",

    "its value was found to be @xmath132 for @xmath133 in experiments by cioni et al .",

    "the coriolis force excites the vertical vorticity in rotating convection .",
