    "in the previous decade , lots of states were found experimentally in the heavy quarkonium mass range that did not at all fit into the scheme predicted by the until then very successful constituent quark model  for a review see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .  @xcite . amongst those many states ,",
    "the @xmath0 is special not only because it was the first such an extraordinary state discovered  it was first seen by the belle collaboration in 2003  @xcite  but also because it resides extremely close to the @xmath7 threshold . indeed , with a mass @xmath8 mev @xcite its binding energy is as small as @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) denotes the mass of the @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) meson  @xcite .",
    "thus it has been regarded as one of the most promising candidates for a hadronic molecule , which may be either an @xmath14-wave bound state  @xcite or a virtual state in the @xmath15 system  @xcite ; both possibilities are in line with its quantum numbers , which were determined by the lhcb collaboration to be @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "other models exist in addition to the hadronic molecule interpretation , which include @xmath16  @xcite  the first radial excitation of the @xmath17-wave charmonium @xmath18,a tetraquark  @xcite , a mixture of an ordinary charmonium and a hadronic molecule  @xcite , or a state generated in the coupled - channel dynamical scheme  @xcite .",
    "one of the celebrated theoretical tools used in studies of hadronic states with heavy quarks is the heavy - quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) .",
    "hqss is based on the observation that for @xmath19 , with @xmath20 denoting the quark mass , the strong interactions in the system are independent of the heavy quark spin .",
    "then , although in case of the charm quark @xmath21 is sizable and one expects non - negligible corrections to the strict symmetry limit , constraints from hqss can still provide a valuable guidance also in the charm sector and in particular for the @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "meanwhile it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the consequences of hqss are very different for the different scenarios for the @xmath22 .",
    "it is therefore crucial to refine the quantitative predictions for the various scenarios . in this work",
    "we focus on a hypothesis that the @xmath0 is a molecular state and investigate the consequences that arise from hqss as well as its leading violations .",
    "in particular , in refs .",
    "@xcite the spin partners of the isovector states @xmath23 and @xmath24 were investigated in the molecular picture and several degenerate states were predicted .",
    "similarly , it was argued in refs .",
    "@xcite that one should expect a shallow bound state in the @xmath25 channel with the quantum numbers @xmath26  the molecular partner of the x(3872 ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on an effective field theory with perturbative pions ( x - eft ) , the width of this state was estimated to be as small as a few mev .    in all mentioned studies as well as in this work",
    "an assumption is made for the dominant molecule component of the wave functions of the states and observable implications of this assumption are investigated . in reality",
    "one can expect that there is an admixture of different components too .",
    "however , given the current quality of the data it appears unclear whether or not the effect of the subdominant components can be identified reliably within a given state .",
    "an exploratory study of the possible impact of genuine quarkonium states on the formation of the molecular spin multiplets is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the future it would certainly be of interest to combine the insights presented in this paper with the ideas of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we refine further the implications of hqss for the @xmath0 and its partners in the molecular picture and critically re - examine the findings of the above mentioned papers .",
    "in particular , we investigate in detail the implications of hqss for the spin partners of the @xmath27 with and without one pion exchange ( ope ) .",
    "we adapt the methods of ref .",
    "@xcite to isoscalar states in the presence of ope , with a special emphasis on the renormalisation to leading order in the heavy quark expansion .",
    "furthermore , we go beyond the heavy - quark limit to demonstrate that the scales emerging in the coupled - channel approach due to the nonperturbative treatment of the pions generate a significant width of the @xmath5 spin partner of the @xmath0 as well as a sizeable shift of its mass .",
    "although pions play an important role in realistic calculations of the spin partners , as we shall demonstrate below , it is instructive to start from a simple analytically solvable model with the only @xmath14-wave contact interactions .",

    "equation  ( [ detct ] ) has two solutions corresponding to the two different linear combinations of the low - energy constants ; one of them , @xmath52 , is the same for all quantum numbers , including @xmath48 and @xmath5 considered before  see eq .",
    "( [ singlechannel ] ) .",

    "( [ vtilde])if the potential @xmath71 is strong enough to bring about bound states .",
    "in summary , in the strict hqss limit the state @xmath0 should have three degenerate spin partner states with the quantum numbers @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , all of them being isoscalar states , like the @xmath0 itself .",
    "in addition , to these four degenerate states , there might exist two further states with the quantum numbers @xmath3 and @xmath4 with a binding energy governed by the other combination of the low - energy constants , @xmath71 .",
    "these additional states can not be predicted from the mass of the @xmath0 and they require additional experimental input .",
    "these findings are in line with those reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "corrections to the hqss limit at leading order in @xmath72 give rise to the known @xmath28-@xmath6 mass splitting .",
    "for convenience , we define the quantities @xmath73 and find for the reduced masses of the @xmath74 , @xmath1 , and @xmath75 pairs to leading order in @xmath76 @xmath77 respectively .",
    "we start with the uncoupled channels corresponding to the quantum numbers @xmath48 and @xmath5 . if , as explained above , the low - energy constant @xmath52 is fixed from the binding energy of the @xmath0 ( @xmath78 . eq .",
    "( [ singlechannel ] ) ) , then for its @xmath5 partner we have the equation @xmath79 where the binding momenta are related to the respective binding energies as @xmath80 and the binding energies are now defined with respect to the relevant thresholds , namely @xmath81    the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ singlechannel2 ] ) are linearly divergent and need to be regularised , for example , by a sharp cut - off in momentum , @xmath82 . then",
    ", dropping all terms which vanish in the limit @xmath83 and retaining only the leading - order terms in @xmath76 , we find that @xmath84 where the ellipsis stands for the small corrections of the order @xmath85 and @xmath86 . equation ( [ gammax2 ] ) relates the binding momentum of the @xmath87 bound state to the binding momentum of the @xmath0 where the latter is treated as input which fixes the strength of the contact potential @xmath52 .",
    "we therefore see that at order @xmath88 an additional counter term is necessary to render the result for the mass of the @xmath89 partner of the @xmath0 well defined .",
    "the value of the counter term may be estimated by associating @xmath90 with the mass scale related to the pionic degrees of freedom which are integrated out in the contact theory .",
    "alternatively one may argue that @xmath90 should be of order of the typical hadronic scale 1 gev .",
    "accordingly , the cut - off - dependent term in eq .",
    "( [ gammax2 ] ) may be estimated to range between 3 and 23 mev for @xmath91 and @xmath92 gev , respectively .",
    "this uncertainty is to be compared with the value of the binding momentum @xmath93 . to estimate the latter in the isospin limit for the @xmath6-meson masses we consider two alternative assumptions : ( i ) the binding energy @xmath53 takes the value quoted in eq .",
    "( [ exexp])this gives @xmath94 mev  and ( ii ) the mass of the @xmath22 coincides with the experimental one such that @xmath95 mev , which leads to @xmath96 mev .",
    "we conclude therefore that from the effective theory with only @xmath14-wave contact interactions the @xmath87 state is expected to lie within a few mev below the @xmath75 threshold .",
    "it is straightforward to check that similar cut - off - dependent corrections induced by the @xmath28-@xmath6 mass difference appear in the channels with the quantum numbers @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , as soon as the @xmath28-@xmath6 mass difference is considered , the propagator matrix is not proportional to the unit matrix anymore and thus the product of the potential and the propagator can not be diagonalised . as a result ,",
    "the poles which appear for these two quantum numbers are determined by both low - energy constants @xmath52 and @xmath97see eq .  ( [ vtilde])simultaneously . accordingly , the binding energies in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 channels are no longer equal to that of the @xmath0 , _ cf . _ eq .  ( [ hqsslimit ] ) . in order to proceed let us _",
    "assume _ that there exists a @xmath4 bound state near the @xmath1 threshold , which we label as @xmath98 .",
    "then both low - energy constants @xmath52 and @xmath97 can be determined independently using the binding momenta @xmath99 and @xmath100 of the @xmath98 and the @xmath0 as input . as a consequence , the binding momenta of the other @xmath4 and @xmath3 states can be predicted analytically from a coupled - channel approach . it should be stressed , however , that the role played by the coupled - channel effects depends on the interplay of the splitting @xmath76 and a typical binding energy of the spin partner states @xmath101 . had the relevant relation between the scales been @xmath102 , then the binding energies discussed in the previous section  see eq .",
    "( [ hqsslimit])would have acquired only small corrections , perturbative in @xmath76 . however , in the realistic case the situation is opposite , @xmath103see eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) for the physical value of @xmath76which calls for a different expansion for the coupled - channel equations .",
    "in particular , now @xmath104 can be treated as a large parameter , and the expansion can be performed in powers of the small ratio @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the binding momentum corresponding to the binding energy @xmath101 in the given channel @xcite .",
    "for example , by an explicit calculation one arrives at @xmath107 for the binding momentum of the other @xmath4 state , residing near the @xmath75 threshold and here referred to as @xmath108 .",
    "this result is remarkable in two respects .",
    "first , states belonging to different hqss multiplets  see eq .",
    "[ hqsslimit]are strongly mixed by the coupled - channel dynamics , so that the binding energy of the @xmath4 @xmath75 state @xmath108 depends now on both input parameters @xmath93 and @xmath99 .",
    "second , the binding momentum @xmath109 acquires an imaginary part and so does the binding momentum @xmath110 of the @xmath111 state ( the spin-0 state near the @xmath75 threshold ) .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that beyond the strict hqss limit in the systems with the quantum numbers @xmath3 and @xmath4 transitions @xmath112 are possible due to coupled channels already in the pionless theory .",
    "it is important to notice that such imaginary parts are controlled by unitarity and therefore they are cut - off - independent to leading order ",
    "( [ gammaxprime ] ) .",
    "the inclusion of the ope interaction brings about additional partial waves in all channels and makes the transitions @xmath112 possible for the quantum number @xmath5 as well , so that @xmath113 becomes complex too  in other words , also the state @xmath87 acquires a finite width .",
    "meanwhile , as is demonstrated by the calculations described below , ope does not spoil the property that the width of the spin - partner state shows only a rather mild cut - off dependence , which makes it possible to treat the broadening of @xmath114 found in the calculations with nonperturbative pions as a reliable prediction of the approach .",
    "it is often claimed that ope plays a crucial role for the formation of the @xmath0the existence of the latter was even predicted based on a model that contained ope only  @xcite .",
    "we shall therefore investigate now the possible role of ope from an effective field theory point of view .",
    "since ope in leading order is in line with hqss , its inclusion does not destroy the multiplet structure discussed above .",
    "however , as we shall demonstrate below , this is only true if both coupled channels and @xmath6 waves are included properly . before studying this issue for the full , nonperturbative system , for illustrative purposes , we start with a discussion of the ope contributions to one - loop order .",
    "this is sufficient to make the mentioned features apparent from the divergence structure of the amplitudes .      in this subsection",
    "we study the leading divergences of the one - loop diagrams which stem from two iterations of the ope potential .",
    "we are going to demonstrate that , in the heavy - quark limit , the coefficients in front of the leading divergences in the @xmath115 ( @xmath116 partial wave ) and @xmath117 ( @xmath118 partial wave ) transition amplitudes coincide only if both @xmath1 and @xmath75 intermediate states are considered and all partial wave are kept in the calculation .",
    "the corresponding set of diagrams is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1loop ] , where the upper row is for the @xmath115 transition while the lower row is for the @xmath117 transition . for convenience ,",
    "we adopt the following convention : the meson floating along the upper line in each diagram is labelled by index 1 while the meson in the lower line is labelled by index 2 .",
    "also , particles in the final state are marked with a prime while particles in the intermediate state are marked with a double prime .    in order to extract the leading divergences it is sufficient to retain only the loop momentum , denoted as @xmath119 , in each vertex .",
    "then , for example , the @xmath120 and @xmath121 vertices for the upper row read @xmath122 \\label{vddpi}\\\\[-2 mm ] v^a(d^*\\to d^*\\pi)&=&\\frac{g_c}{2 f_\\pi}\\tau_1^a(-i[{{\\bm \\epsilon}}_1\\times{{\\bm \\epsilon}}_1 ' ] \\cdot{{\\bm l}}),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath123 denotes the polarisation vector of the @xmath28 meson and @xmath124 is the isospin pauli matrix .",

    "the operator @xmath134 labels the spin - orbit structure of the respective diagram .",
