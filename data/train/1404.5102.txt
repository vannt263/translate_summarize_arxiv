    "after the discovery of the isotropic radiation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) of the universe by a. a. penzias and r. w. wilson in 1965 @xcite , r. k. sachs and a. m wolfe predict the existence of anisotropy in the cmb associated with the gravitational redshift in 1967 @xcite .",
    "they fully integrate the geodesic equation in a perturbed friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric in the fully general relativistic framework .",
    "the sachs - wolfe ( sw ) is the first paper that predicts the presence of the anisotropy in the cmb which now plays an important role for constraining cosmological models , the nature of dark energy , modified gravity , and non - gaussianity of the primordial fluctuation .",
    "let us begin by reviewing the history .",
    "in the first twenty years since the sachs - wolfe paper , most of the works were focused on the extension of the sachs - wolfe calculation to non - linear collapsed object @xcite , or non - standard cosmological model such as topological defects @xcite .",
    "partridge and wilkinson 1967 first gave a glimpse of the existence of inhomogeneity in the cmb temperature by using the dicke radiometer @xcite .",
    "they found the temperature excess on the direction of the known quasar cluster position and considered it as the rees - sciama effect @xcite . in the age of the cobe satellite ,",
    "the sachs - wolfe paper attracted a huge attention .",
    "most of the papers were focused on the theoretical prediction that was related to the observation ; prediction of the amplitude of the quadrupole power for the sw effect .",
    "crittenden & turok 1996 pointed out that the gravitational potential may decay in the @xmath0 dominated universe at @xmath1 to produce the isw signal @xcite .",
    "they also proposed a novel method to detect the isw effect by cross correlating the large - scale structure with the cmb .",
    "kneissl et al .",
    "1997 made an attempt to extract the isw effect by cross correlating the cmb observed by the cobe with the rosat x - ray background @xcite , boughn & crittenden 2002 used the nvss radio galaxies for the cross correlation @xcite , and boughn et al .",
    "1998 used the heao1 a2 x - ray background @xcite but none of them could find the significant detection .",
    "the sachs - wolfe paper has attracted a renewed attention in the wmap era .",
    "the first detection of the isw was finally achieved by cross - correlating the wmap first - year data with the number count of radio galaxies from the nvss data , as well as with the heao1 a1 x - ray data @xcite .",
    "subsequently a lot of detections with various mass tracers have been reported . in the early 2000",
    "s , much work was focused on obtaining cosmological constraint on dark energy models from the isw effect , while in the late 2000 s to present , more and more works studied various systematic effects which may enter in different ways for different measurement methods .    in this paper",
    ", we review the isw effect from theoretical derivation of the basic equations to the present cosmological interpretations . the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theory ] , we revisit the derivation of the cmb anisotropy induced by the perturbation of the background geometry decomposed into scalar , vector and tensor modes . in section [ sec : observation ] , we discuss the statistical properties of the isw effect and the method to measure it in the cross correlation with the large - scale structure .",
    "we also discuss the possible systematic effects that affect our interpretations . in section [ sec : models ] , we provide cosmological applications of the isw effect including constraints on dark energy and primordial non - gaussianity . in section [ sec : summary ] , we give a summary .",
    "in this section , we derive the basic equations of the isw effect based on the original paper @xcite .",
    "we first write the line element in a spatially flat frw metric , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the scale factor that depends solely on the conformal time @xmath4 and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the metric and a conformally transformed metric , respectively .",
    "the metric consists of perturbed and unperturbed parts , i.e. @xmath7 , with the unperturbed metric @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "here we ignore all the quantity of order @xmath10 and higher .",
    "introducing two affine parameters @xmath4 and @xmath11 to characterize the photon geodesic in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 metric respectively , we have @xmath12 since the action of the geodesic should be invariant under the rescaling of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . to simplify the calculation , we first work on the @xmath6 system and then translate it to the @xmath5 system .",
    "the metric perturbation can be decomposed into scalar , vector and tensor modes .",
    "@xmath15 can be divided into the contributions from scalar and vector while @xmath16 can be divided into the contributions from scalar , vector , and tensor modes as , @xmath17 +     ( \\partial_jc^{\\rm ( v)}_{i } + \\partial_ic^{\\rm ( v)}_{j } )     + c^{\\rm ( t)}_{ij},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are arbitrary functions and superscript with the parenthesis ( s ) , ( v ) and ( t ) stand for the scalar , vector and tensor quantities respectively .",
    "the derivative @xmath20 denotes the 3 dimensional covariant derivative .",
    "the scalar perturbation is not generated from the vector or tensor mode and the vector perturbation is not generated from the tensor mode thus we have constraints as @xmath21      we now need to fix a gauge degree of freedom . for the scalar perturbation ,",
    "the conformal newtonian gauge ( longitudinal gauge ) is useful ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the newtonian gauge ,",
    "all the gauge degrees of freedom are used to eliminate the off - diagonal components of the perturbed metric .",
    "then the variables are fixed as @xmath22 , and the metric perturbation can be fully described by the two scalar quantities of @xmath23 which are already gauge invariant .",
    "the metric turns out to be @xmath24 ,      \\label{eq : app3 - 1.8}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are newtonian potential and curvature perturbation respectively .",
    "then we naturally obtain the non vanishing connections , @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "the photon geodesic @xmath29 can be obtained by solving the geodesic equation , @xmath30 where we introduce the 4-momentum @xmath31 .",
    "it can be decomposed into the unperturbed and perturbed geodesic as @xmath32 .",
    "the photon energy is measured by the observer moving with the fluid , thus the observed energy needs to be projected with the 4-velocity in the un - tilde @xmath33 system , @xmath34 by definition @xmath35 , the unperturbed component is @xmath36 .",
    "the 4-velocity is written as @xmath37 .",
    "the spatial 3 dimensional velocity is already first order quantity , hence we do not need to explicitly solve the spacial part of the geodesic equation , .",
    "the solution for the unperturbed background is trivial , i.e. @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the 4-tangent vector of the geodesic .",
    "the time part of the first order solution of equation is integrated as @xmath40     + \\int^{\\tau_*}_{\\tau_0 } ( \\phi ' + \\psi ' ) { { \\rm d}}\\tau ,    \\label{eq : app3 - 1.15}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 denotes the conformal time of the decoupling time , and @xmath42 today .",
    "now the redshift is defined by the photon energy ratio between emitter and receiver , @xmath43.using the fact that under the rescaling of @xmath44 , the 4-momentum scales as @xmath45 , @xmath46 since the temperature drops with redshift as @xmath47 , using equations , and , observed temperature fluctuation over the sky is @xmath48_{\\tau_0}^{\\tau _ * }      + \\int^{\\tau_*}_{\\tau_0 }      ( \\phi'+\\psi ' ) d\\tau ,      \\label{eq : app3 - 1.22}\\ ] ] apart from the isotropic temperature .",
    "the first term is the intrinsic photon fluctuation at the last scattering surface other than those induced by the metric perturbation ; @xmath49 .",
    "the second term is the gravitational redshift due to our gravitational potential which is the monopole contribution and can not be observed .",
    "the third term represents the temperature anisotropy caused by the gravitational redshift due to the potential fluctuations at the decoupling epoch , which is called the naive or ordinary sachs wolfe effect in the literature .",
    "since it also has the spacial dependence , we shall write @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the angular position on the sky . the fourth term is the doppler effect that is induced by the relative motion between the observer and the cmb last scattering surface .",
    "the final integral term represents the temperature anisotropy caused by the time variation of gravitational potential integrated along the line of sight , and this is the isw effect .",
    "since the gravitational potential is static in the matter dominated universe , i.e. einstein de - sitter universe , the isw effect vanishes in the linear perturbation limit .",
    "thus the isw effect induces temperature fluctuation at radiation dominated era or dark energy or curvature dominated universe .",
    "the former is called the early isw and the latter the late isw effect .",
    "we note that from the current observations the matter radiation equality time , @xmath52 is well before the decoupling , @xmath53 and thus the temperature fluctuation of the early isw is regarded as a part of the primary anisotropy .",
    "we also note that the careful authors include the visibility function to the last scattering surface in the integrand , @xmath54 , where @xmath4 is the optical depth ; however , in the flat @xmath0cdm universe , the redshift where the isw effect becomes important is at @xmath55 , and thus @xmath56 is a good approximation .",
    "the photon geodesic is perturbed also by the vector and tensor modes . for the vector mode ,",
    "the geodesic perturbation can be characterized by @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the temperature anisotropy induced by the vector mode is given by @xmath59 ^{\\tau_*}_{\\tau_0 } +     \\frac12 \\int ^{\\tau_*}_{\\tau_0 } \\ !",
    "d\\tau ( \\partial_i v_j + \\partial_j v_i ) e^i e^j ,      \\label{eq : vt1}\\ ] ] where the first term is intrinsic vector type temperature fluctuation , @xmath60 is a rotational component of the velocity and @xmath61 . in the standard scenario of the inflation ,",
    "the vacuum fluctuation generates no super - horizon vector mode perturbation @xcite .",
    "even if it is generated with some exotic mechanisms , vector mode has a only decaying mode solution which can be negligible at later times ; thus we shall assume that the vector mode does not exist @xcite .",
    "in practice , it makes negligible contribution to the cmb temperature observation so we assume it is absent .",
    "the tensor mode , in other words the gravitational wave , is given by the traceless transverse rank two tensor , @xmath62 in equation .",
    "the temperature fluctuation induced by the tensor mode metric perturbation is @xmath63 the tensor mode decays on the scales smaller than the horizon at the decoupling , say @xmath64 degree , and the significant contribution comes from the largest scales .",
    "recently , the bicep2 experiment report that they detect a signature of large amplitude of the gravitational wave which is observed by the b - mode polarization power spectrum of the cmb @xcite .",
    "this is indeed the tensor isw effect ! the best fit value of the tensor to scalar ratio is @xmath65 after removing the foreground components .       and @xmath66 , respectively and the horizontal thick purple line below @xmath67 $ ] shows the tensor contribution with @xmath65 . also shown by points with errorbars is the cmb power spectrum obtained by the first year low-@xmath68 planck data @xcite .",
    "[ fig : isw_spectrum ] ]    in this section , we consider the power spectrum for the scalar mode perturbation .",
    "here we assume that the energy contents of the universe have no anisotropic stress , which relates @xmath25 and @xmath26 as @xmath69 .",
    "then the integrated sachs wolfe effect is written as @xmath70 now the potential @xmath25 can be related to the density fluctuation through the poisson equation . working in the fourier space makes things simple . in the fourier space ,",
    "the poisson equation in the flat frw universe is , @xmath71      \\label{eq : spectrum2}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the density contrast and divergence of velocity of the matter , respectively and @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the matter density and hubble parameter today , respectively . in the newtonian limit where the scale of interest is well smaller than the horizon , i.e. @xmath76 , equation is reduced to the well known form , @xmath77 .",
    "we usually expand the fourier basis into the spherical harmonics and spherical bessel function to obtain the full sky expression of the fluctuation in a direction @xmath51 , @xmath78 the spherical harmonic counterpart is obtained using the orthogonality of the spherical harmonics , @xmath79 the angular power spectrum is then calculated as , @xmath80 ^ 2 ,      \\label{eq : spectrum5}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the velocity factor , @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the conformal hubble parameter . the numerical calculation of equation would be formidable because of the oscillatory behavior of the bessel function .",
    "the hankel or also known as fourier - bessel transform can be helpful instead of the direct integration @xcite .",
    "the limber s approximation is used in the literature but it is accurate only up to @xmath84 on scales larger than @xmath85 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ fig : isw_spectrum ] shows the power spectra of the primary cmb temperature fluctuation and the isw effect for the best fit model to the planck first year data combined with the wmap polarization and high-@xmath68 cmb experiments @xcite .",
    "we also show the anisotropy generated from the tensor mode with tensor to scalar ratio @xmath65 which is recently suggested by the discovery of the bicep2 experiment @xcite .",
    "we use the publicly available camb code to compute the scalar and the tensor spectra .",
    "the isw component can be easily calculated by the slight modification to the  _ equations.f90 _  .",
    "most of the signal at @xmath86 comes from the primary anisotropy while on large scales , significant fraction of anisotropy is generated at low redshifts , @xmath87 .",
    "we also show the first year low-@xmath68 planck data .",
    "because the large @xmath88 value constrained by the b - mode power spectrum , @xmath89 of the bicep2 enhances the amplitude of the temperature fluctuation , @xmath90 on large scales , it is required to make some modifications of the model to keep the current observational constraints from the wmap or the planck unchanged : either the smaller ( i.e. negatively larger ) value of running of scalar spectral index @xmath91 @xcite or isocurvature component of the initial fluctuation is required @xcite to suppress the large scale power of the cmb temperature power spectrum",
    ". however , the amplitude of tensor mode with @xmath65 model is subdominant at @xmath92 compared to the isw component .",
    "thus there still remains some possibilities that the non - standard gravity models or the nonlinearity of the local large - scale structure can alter the amplitude of the isw effect , and thus the constraint on the negatively large value of the running or the fraction of the isocurvature perturbation component might be reduced .",
    "m. j. rees and d. w. sciama extended the sachs - wolfe calculation to non - linear collapsed objects in 1968 @xcite . in 1967",
    ", they were investigating an apparent large - scale clustering of quasars @xcite reported by strittmatter & faulkner @xcite .",
    "they consider the possibility that inhomogeneity in the matter distribution inferred from the large - scale clustering of quasars creates anisotropy in the cmb as predicted by sachs & wolfe and estimates the amplitude of the temperature fluctuation induced by a spherically symmetric collapse of the objects in an expanding universe @xcite .",
    "note that here we use the terminology of _ non - linear _ as the non - linear density fluctuations but the metric perturbations ( hence the geodesic perturbations ) are kept at the first order .",
    "the second order cosmological perturbation is treated in a consistent manner in @xcite but here we limit our discussion to the first order geodesic equation and non - linearity is only included in density perturbations . using the poisson equation , we see that there are two contributions to time evolution of a gravitational potential @xmath93 here we have used the continuity equation @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the momentum of the density field @xmath96 . from equation , we see that the isw and rs effects consist of two components : one proportional to the hubble flow and the other the momentum of the object . in the linear perturbation limit ,",
    "the momentum is equal to the velocity field so the linear isw effect in principle traces the statistical property of the large - scale velocity field @xcite . in a weakly non - linear regime or fully non - linear regime ,",
    "a halo model approach is used to describe the non - linear time evolution of the gravitational potential which is originally developed for describing the non - linear clustering of the dark matter halo @xcite . the dark matter power spectrum is described by the sum of two contributions : a two - halo term where the pair is in different halos , and a one - halo term where the pair is in the same halo @xcite . once we provide the mass function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and profile of the dark matter halo @xcite then we can immediately calculate the non - linear clustering of the dark matter .",
    "similarly , the velocity field can be decomposed into two components : the velocity due to the virial motion about the center of mass of its parent halo , and that due to the motion of the parent halo itself @xcite which provides the non - linear momentum power spectrum @xcite .",
    "another approach is the higher order perturbation theory . as we will see in section [ sec : observation ] , the cross correlation between the isw and density tracer is useful to isolate the isw effect from the cmb @xcite .",
    "then the angular cross correlation power spectrum between the isw and any tracers of the density field can be some function of the cross power spectrum of @xmath97 and @xmath25 , @xmath98 where we employ the notation , @xmath99 .",
    "the continuity equation is written as @xmath100 where @xmath73 is the divergence of the velocity .",

    "as pointed out in ref @xcite , if we look at the particular scale , the significance is prominent and have tension to the standard @xmath0cdm prediction but the significance goes down if we combine all scales ; it is so called a posteriori selection effect @xcite .",

    "thus , we need to be careful when interpreting the null detection of the isw at high redshift .      the galactic dust extinction may be a major source of systematics in the measurement of the isw effect @xcite . in the region where the galactic dust extinction is high ,",
    "the galaxy colors tend to be red and alter the large - scale distribution of the galaxy sample depending on the wavelength observed . in the high extinction region",
    ", we also expect the observed temperature map to contain microwave emission from the galactic dust which then produce a spurious correlations between the temperature map and the galaxy count data .",
    "the advantages to use the near- to mid - infrared are to minimize the amount of the dust extinction , which enables us to mitigate the systematics .",
    "correcting the effect of dust is essential for the cross - correlation study because it allows us to use more sky area .",
    "as the isw effect appears only on large angular scales where both the cmb and galaxy data are almost sample variance limited , increasing the usable sky area is the only way to increase statistical significance of the cross - correlation signal .",
    "however the dust correction contains uncertainty and it may affect the precise measurement .",
    "a more conservative approach is to simply mask out the contaminated region of the sky .",
    "giannantonio et al .",
    "@xcite exclude the high extinction region with @xmath224 and @xmath225 which leaves the usable sky fraction of @xmath226 and 0.11 , respectively .",
    "the latter has less contamination but larger statistical error and is statistically consistent with the former to within 1 @xmath176 .",
    "therefor the former cut appears to be sufficient for this data set .      a correlation between the cmb and the large - scale structure is also generated by the sz effect and point sources . as high energy electron scatters cmb photon through the inverse compton scattering in a high temperature cluster of galaxies , the sz effect distorts the shape of the blackbody cmb spectrum .",
    "for that reason , the temperature change induced by the sz effect depends on the frequency we observe ; temperature decreases at low frequency while it increases at high frequency and no change occurs at 217 ghz .",
    "thus the sz signal in the cross correlation can in principle be isolated with multi - frequency observations .",
    "furthermore , the characteristic angular scale that the sz effect correlates with the large - scale structure is smaller than that of the isw effect . in the harmonics space , the isw peaks at @xmath227 and",
    "becomes negligible at @xmath228 while the sz effect becomes important at @xmath229 @xcite .",
    "the point sources found in the cmb map are extra - galactic sources such as agns and dusty galaxies .",
    "they are bright in low ( agns ) and high ( dusty galaxies ) frequency bands .",
    "they are also visible in optical and infrared bands , where many galaxy survey data are available .",
    "they also produce a correlation between the cmb and large - scale structure ; however , it can be distinguished from the isw signal because point sources produce a correlation at much smaller scales than that of the isw effect @xcite .",
    "this discrimination by scale is possible only for the power spectrum in harmonics space but impossible for the correlation function in the configuration space because , in the harmonic space , multipole scales where isw and point sources signals become prominent are different while in the configuration space , different angular scales and the different physical origins do not have one to one correspondance @xcite .",

    "[ fig : ng ] ]    although the recent observation of the cmb by the planck shows that the non gaussianity ( ng ) of the primordial fluctuation is consistent with zero , it is still worth discussing it for the future observations which would give much tighter constraints on ( or potentially detect ) ng . in this section ,",
    "we describe the possible impacts of the ng of the primordial fluctuation on the isw effect .",
    "we assume that the ng has the form of @xcite , @xmath271 with the parameter @xmath272 which describes the amplitude of ng of the primordial fluctuation , and @xmath140 is a random gaussian variable .",
    "the isw effect basically plays two roles in the context of ng .",
    "first , the isw effect can be a proxy of mass of the large - scale structure especially on large scales .",
    "it is difficult to discriminate the primordial ng from those which originate from the non linear gravitational evolution of the structure .",
    "however , the non - zero @xmath272 alters the number of rare objects formed responding to the initial gravitational potentials .",
    "the number of rare objects is enhanced if the @xmath272 is positive but depressed for the negative @xmath272 .",
    "thus the effect of non - zero @xmath272 on the halo or galaxy power spectrum becomes prominent on large scales @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the ng bias acquires a correction of @xmath273 , where @xmath274 where @xmath275 is the critical density , @xmath276 is the usual eulerian constant bias .",

    "the galaxy - galaxy auto - correlation is mainly used for constraining the ng and the isw - galaxy cross correlation has relatively lower statistical power . however , the cross correlation is less sensitive to the systematic effects and thus gives a robust measurement ; they are complementary to each other .",
    "figure [ fig : ng ] compares the cross correlation power spectrum of the isw and the nvss galaxies with the standard @xmath0cdm prediction and ng predictions keeping all the parameters other than @xmath272 unchanged @xcite .",

    "lately giannantonio et al .",
    "2014 @xcite point out that the nvss catalog contains a serious systematic error : the number density of galaxies depends on declination and right ascension .",

    "giannantonio and percival 2014 @xcite revisit the ng constraints via cross correlation of the isw effect with a suite of galaxy samples and find no evidence of the ng , @xmath280 by using the isw - galaxy cross correlation only .",

    "this is consistent with the cmb bispectrum analysis of the planck @xcite .",
    "second , the isw effect may bring a systematic effect to the measurement of the cmb bispectrum through the isw - lensing correlation @xcite .",
    "the observed cmb temperature can be decomposed into three parts ; primordial cmb at last scattering surface , lensed - cmb , and the secondary anisotropy that is generated at low redshifts such as the isw or the sz . for the gaussian field ,",
    "all the information is encoded into the power spectrum or two point correlation function so that the bispectrum or three point function is the lowest statistics that describes the ng clustering .",
    "however , the isw effect and the cmb - lensing are correlated with each other because the large - scale structure that makes cmb photon deflect via gravitational lens also induces the isw effect at low redshift .",
    "therefore it mimics the primordial ng to produce a non - zero signal in the cmb bispectrum .",
    "the isw effect is important on large scales and the cmb - lensing appears on much smaller scales , so the isw - lensing bispectrum peaks at a squeezed configuration of the triangle .",

    "the bispectrum is negligible @xcite .",
    "in this article we review the isw effect induced by linear and non - linear structures of the universe .",
    "it is well known that the sachs - wolfe effect and the isw effect are simultaneously derived from the cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "the isw effect can be generated by scalar , vector and tensor mode fluctuations of the metric but the significant contribution comes from the scalar mode , which is related to the time variation of the matter density fluctuation .",
    "the recent detection of the tensor - mode cmb polarization claimed by the bicep2 collaboration @xcite can indeed be the polarization generated by the tensor - mode isw effect from primordial gravitational waves .",
    "the time variation of the gravitational potential in the standard @xmath0cdm universe comes from : 1 ) the coherent decay of the gravitational potential due to the accelerating expansion of the universe , 2 ) the isotropic clustering inflow of mass lump toward the center of mass , and 3 ) the transverse motions of the clusters .",
    "the latter two effects are too tiny to detect with the current cmb experiments but it might be possible to detect with future experiments having finer angular resolutions such as actpol @xcite , sptpol @xcite or core @xcite .",
    "we also review the observational studies of the isw effect .",
    "the isw effect was first detected by the cross correlation of the cmb observed by the wmap with the number counts of the radio galaxies measured by the nvss .",
    "the significance of detection was @xmath284 @xcite .",
    "subsequently a number of detections have been reported with various tracers of dark matter using a variety of statistical methods .",
    "as the isw effect reflects the large - scale fluctuations in the universe , they can be used for constraining the cosmological models especially at low redshifts ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the statistical error of the isw effect is mostly dominated by sample variance but the detection significances vary among papers and are often not consistent with each other .",
    "it is partly due to the consequence of the different statistics they used , different treatments of the foreground , or different estimates or assumptions on the redshift distribution of galaxies .",
    "as we acquire more knowledge on those issues , we may be able to understand inconsistencies seen in table [ table : comparison ] .",
    "all sky polarization data from the planck will be useful for further studying the dust model of our galaxy as well as the confirmation of the large amplitude of tensor mode fluctuation discovered by the bicep2 .",
