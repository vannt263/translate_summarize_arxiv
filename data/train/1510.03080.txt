    "spin hall effect ( she ) was predicted theoretically in 1971 by dyakonov and perel .",
    "@xcite two decades later , interest in this effect was renewed after the paper by hirsch,@xcite and now it attracts a lot of attention as a possible method of spin current generation.@xcite the phenomenon was observed experimentally only a decade ago,@xcite and since then it is one of the most important issues in spintronics , playing a major role in the process of generation and detection of spin currents in a pure electrical manner.@xcite spin current , in turn , plays a key role in the process of electrically controlled magnetic switching as it generates a spin torque when being absorbed in a magnetic system.@xcite    it is also well known that the she is a consequence of spin - orbit interaction .",
    "this interaction , in turn , may be either of intrinsic or extrinsic origin .",
    "the extrinsic she is associated with mechanisms of spin - dependent electron scattering on impurities and other structural defects with spin - orbit interaction ( skew scattering and side jump ) , whereas the intrinsic she is a consequence of a nontrivial trajectory of charge carriers in the momentum space due to the contribution of intrinsic spin - orbit interaction to the corresponding band structure.@xcite    the transverse spin currents and spin accumulation in systems with spin - orbit interaction can be induced not only by an external electric field , but also due to a temperature gradient in the system .",
    "thus , a difference in temperatures of the two ends of a system with spin orbit interaction gives rise to a spin current that flows perpendicularly to the temperature gradient .",
    "this phenomenon is known as the spin nernst effect ( sne ) , but it is also sometimes referred to as the thermally - induced spin hall effect .",
    "@xcite physical origin of sne is very similar to that of she , and one can distinguish the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to sne , similarly as in the case of she . however , there are some differences between these two phenomena , which are associated with different influence of the driving forces ( electric field for she and temperature gradient for sne ) on the electron distribution function in the momentum space .",
    "this difference leads to some differences in the relevant theoretical formalisms and descriptions .    as the physical mechanisms of the she and sne are rather well understood , the influence of finite temperature on both these phenomena , especially on the she , received less attention in the literature .",
    "the effect of temperature on the spin current was considered , for instance , by bencheikh and vignale,@xcite who applied the spin density matrix method to a spin current in two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit interactions . using a simple argument",
    "it was also predicted that the spin hall conductivity in 2deg with rashba interaction should vanish at arbitrary temperature.@xcite in turn , since a temperature gradient is the driving force for sne , the temperature effects are inherently included in the corresponding descriptions .",
    "though many of them are limited to the low temperature regime , the zero temperature limit , however , was not studied thoroughly enough .",
    "there are several different approaches to the spin nernst phenomenon .",
    "for example , lyapilin  @xcite used the nonequilibrium statistical operator , taking into account electron scattering processes in 2deg with rashba interaction .",
    "this theory , however , does not give clear information on the role of individual microscopic mechanisms of sne .",
    "similar problem was also studied by ma .",
    "@xcite in turn , akera and suzuura  @xcite used the boltzmann equation formalism to analyze the sne due to extrinsic mechanisms , like skew scattering and side jump .",
    "the spin nernst effect due to skew - scattering was also considered by _ ab initio _ numerical methods based on various approximations with respect to the electronic structure and transport properties ",
    "see for example refs  [ ] .",
    "the room temperature sne was considered recently by tlle _",
    "et al_.  @xcite they have taken into account dynamical spin - orbit coupling ( spin - orbit coupling with the vibrating lattice and impurities ) and found a contribution due to the so - called dynamical side - jump mechanism . in turn , borge _",
    "et al_@xcite used matsubara green functions to derive some results on thermoelectrics and spin thermoelectrics in two - dimensional disordered electron gas .",
    "one should also mention , that the spin nernst effect in the mesoscopic regime was studied using the landauer - bttiker formalism for the four - terminal cross - bar geometry in systems based on the 2deg with rashba spin - orbit coupling ( see e.g. [ ] and references therein ) and hgte quantum wells .",
    "@xcite    there is still lack of a consistent theory that takes into account all microscopic mechanisms and describes the spin hall and spin nernst effects at high temperatures .",
    "this problem , however , is of significant importance if one takes into account experimental side and also possible applications , e.g. for magnetic switching in spintronics devices .",
    "the importance of finite - temperatures in the theoretical interpretation of she has been emphasized recently by gorini _ at al_.@xcite moreover , the zero - temperature limit of the spin nernst conductivity has not been studied in detail , though it is known that orbital contribution to the anomalous nernst effect has to be included to have accurate zero temperature behavior.@xcite therefore , in this paper we consider the temperature dependence of she and sne . we restrict consideration to a two - dimensional electron gas with spin - orbit interaction of rashba type .",
    "such a system is a model system for many semiconductor devices . using the matsubara green function formalism and the auxiliary vector potential in the case of temperature gradient ,",
    "@xcite we find some general equations that describe the spin hall and spin nernst conductivities . in the latter case",
    "we also predict a contribution to the spin nernst conductivity due to spin - resolved orbital magnetization . based on these equations ,",
    "we have derived analytical formulas for the she and sne conductivities in the _ bare bubble _ approximation .",
    "taking into account electron scattering on impurities , we show that the total cancelation of the intrinsic contribution to the spin hall conductivity by the corresponding contribution due to vertex correction takes place not only at zero temperature , but also at higher temperatures , in agreement with earlier predictions.@xcite in the case of spin nernst effect we show that the total spin nernst conductivity vanishes at @xmath0 when a spin - resolved orbital magnetization is taken into account , but generally is finite at nonzero temperatures .    this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model of a two - dimensional rashba electron gas and derive some general formulas for the spin hall and spin nernst conductivities . in sections",
    "iii and iv we present results on the spin hall and spin nernst conductivities , respectively .",
