    "low temperature physics continues to be a vibrant area of research , providing a number of interesting and exciting challenges .",
    "many of these are associated with the properties of superfluids / superconductors , either created in the laboratory or in the cores of mature neutron stars . basically , matter appears to have two options when the temperature decreases towards absolute zero . according to classical physics one would expect the atoms in a liquid to slow down and come to rest , forming a crystalline structure .",
    "it is , however , possible that quantum effects become relevant before the liquid solidifies leading to the formation of a superfluid condensate ( a quantum liquid ) .",
    "this will only happen if the interaction between the atoms is attractive and relatively weak .",
    "the archetypal superfluid system is helium .",
    "it is well established that he@xmath0 exhibits superfluidity below @xmath1  k. above this temperature liquid helium is accurately described by the navier - stokes equations . below the critical temperature",
    "the modelling of superfluid he@xmath0 requires a `` two - fluid '' description @xcite .",
    "two fluid degrees of freedom are required to explain , in particular , the presence of a second sound associated with thermal waves in the system .",
    "phenomenologically , the basic behaviour of superfluid helium is easy to understand if one first considers a system at absolute zero temperature .",
    "then the dynamics is entirely due to the quantum condensate .",
    "there exists a single quantum wavefunction , and the momentum of the flow follows directly from the gradient of its phase .",
    "this immediately implies that the flow is irrotational . at finite temperatures ,",
    "one must also account for thermal excitations ( like phonons ) .",
    "that is , not all atoms remain in the ground state .",
    "a second dynamical degree of freedom arises since the excitation gas may drift relative to the atoms . in the standard two - fluid model ,",
    "one makes a distinction between a `` normal '' fluid component and a superfluid part .",
    "the associated densities are to a large extent statistical concepts , as one can not physically separate the `` normal fluid '' from the `` superfluid '' @xcite .",
    "it is important to keep this in mind .",
    "the standard two - fluid model for superfluid hydrodynamics derives from the classic work of london and tisza .",
    "yet , there exists a number of alternative approaches to the problem .",
    "it has , for example , been demonstrated that the two - fluid equations @xcite can be obtained from a `` single fluid '' model , provided that a distinction is made between a background flow and the sound waves ( phonons ) in the system @xcite .",
    "another interesting strategy is to apply results from extended irreversible thermodynamics @xcite to the helium problem .",
    "extended thermodynamics was developed to deal with a number of unattractive features of the classic results , e.g. the infinite propagation speed of thermal signals associated with fourier s law . in order to arrive at a causal description ,",
    "one introduces additional variables ( motivated by the kinetic theory of gases ) leading to a system with richer dynamics .",
    "one of these variables is the heat flux . in the limit of rapid thermal relaxation one retains fourier s law , while a slow relaxation leads to the presence of a second sound .",
    "it is easy to show that the latter limit can be used to describe superfluid systems @xcite .",
    "we now know that many low temperature systems exhibit superfluid properties .",
    "the different phases of he@xmath2 have been well studied , both theoretically and experimentally @xcite , and there is considerable current interest in atomic bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "in fact , the relevance of superfluid dynamics reaches beyond systems that are accessible in the laboratory .",
    "it is generally expected that neutron stars , which are formed when massive stars run out of nuclear fuel and collapse following a supernova explosion , will contain a number of superfluid phases , see @xcite for a recent account .",
    "this expectation is natural given the extreme core density ( reaching several times the nuclear saturation density ) and low temperature ( compared to the nuclear scale of the fermi temperatures of the different constituents , about @xmath3  k ) of these stars .",
    "the outer regions of a typical neutron star will contain a , more or less solid , crust where the nuclei form a crystalline lattice . as the density increases the so - called neutron drip",
    "is reached . beyond this point",
    "the crust lattice will coexist with degenerate neutrons .",
    "if the temperature is sufficiently low , below around @xmath4  k , the strong interaction develops an attractive component ( which is necessary for the bcs mechanism to operate ) and these neutrons will be superfluid and may flow through the lattice .",
    "when the density reaches nuclear saturation , the crust lattice gives way to the fluid core of the star . in the outer parts of this core",
    ", the neutron fluid will co - exist with protons , electrons and perhaps muons . at low temperatures , both neutrons and protons",
    "are expected to form condensates .",
    "hence one is forced to consider the dynamics of a neutron superfluid coexisting with a proton superconductor and a relativistic gas of electrons / muons .",
    "modelling an entire star , with all these different phases , is a serious challenge .",
    "yet , the nature of the outer core is relatively well understood .",
    "the physics of the deep core is much less certain @xcite .",
    "one alternative is that the composition continues to change as the presence of more massive baryons ( hyperons ) becomes energetically favourable .",
    "another possibility is that the ground state of matter at high density corresponds to a plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons .",
    "the different phases of matter provide a number of different channels for cooper pairing , leading to many potential `` superfluid '' components . in order to develop a moderately realistic model for a neutron star core",
    "we need to improve our understanding of tricky issues concerning hyperon superfluidity and quark colour superconductors @xcite .",
    "neutron star observations may provide the only way to constrain our models for this extreme sector of physics .",
    "the rapid spin - up and subsequent relaxation associated with radio pulsar glitches @xcite provides strong , albeit indirect , evidence for neutron star superfluidity . the standard model for these events is based on , in the first instance , the pinning of superfluid vortices ( e.g. to the crust lattice ) which allows a rotational lag to build up between the superfluid and the part of the star that spins down electromagnetically , and secondly the sudden unpinning which transfers angular momentum from one component to the other leading to the observed spin - change .",
    "key to the modelling of these events is the vortex pinning and the mutual friction ( see @xcite for a recent discussion ) between the two components in the star .",
    "the modelling of superfluid neutron star oscillations has also received considerable attention .",
    "it is known that different classes of pulsation modes can be , more or less clearly , associated with different aspects of the neutron star model . as an example , a superfluid star has a set of oscillation modes that arise because of the existence of the second sound @xcite .",
    "the hope is that one will be able to use future observations , e.g. via gravitational waves , to learn more about the interior composition of the star @xcite . particularly interesting in this respect is the possibility that various oscillation modes may be unstable .",
    "the most promising such instability is ( according to current thinking ) associated with the inertial r - modes , see @xcite for reviews of the relevant literature .",
    "the r - mode instability is expected to be active provided that the gravitation radiation reaction , which drives the instability , is more efficient than the different damping mechanisms that suppress the growth of the mode . on the one hand , this is interesting because it makes the instability window sensitive to the detailed composition of the star .",
    "on the other hand , it makes realistic modelling of the instability exceedingly difficult .",
    "having said that , progress has been made on understanding the nature of the r - modes in a superfluid neutron star @xcite , in particular the role of the vortex mediated mutual friction damping .",
    "we also know that the bulk viscosity associated with hyperons and deconfined quarks can affect the results significantly @xcite . in all cases",
    "the effects of superfluidity will be considerable .",
    "so far , studies of the dynamics of superfluid neutron stars have almost exclusively considered the zero temperature problem .",
    "this is an obvious starting point since i ) it simplifies the analysis and ii ) mature neutron stars tend to be `` cold '' , with core temperature below @xmath5",
    "k. however , this logic has an obvious flaw .",
    "the critical temperature at which the different phases of matter become superfluid is density dependent @xcite .",
    "for instance , singlet state pairing of neutrons is expected to be present from just beyond the neutron drip to some point in the fluid core . for",
    "any given stellar temperature there must therefore exist transition regions where thermal effects play a dominant role .",
    "a detailed model ought to account for these regions .",
    "this involves understanding the dynamical role of the thermal excitations .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to take some steps towards such an understanding .",
    "we will demonstrate the close connection between the variational multi - fluid framework @xcite that we have previously used to model the outer neutron star core @xcite , and the classic two - fluid model for he@xmath0 at finite temperatures @xcite .",
    "this is an important contribution which clearly establishes the viability of the variational multi - fluid approach , and lays the foundation for future applications to problems of astrophysical relevance .",
    "a similar comparison between the corresponding non - dissipative relativistic formulations has already been carried out by @xcite .",
    "they demonstrate how the convective variational multi - fluid formalism developed by carter  see @xcite for detailed discussions  on which our multi - fluid formalism is based , can be translated into the model developed by @xcite .",
    "our analysis provides additional insight into how thermal excitations should be accounted for , as well as an idea of the dissipation coefficients that are needed to complete a finite temperature model .",
    "even though our aim is not to reformulate the modelling of superfluid helium , we believe that our discussion should be of some interest also in that context",
    ". the most relevant contributions may be the variational derivation of the hydrodynamic equations ( and the associated use of truly conserved flux quantities ) and the analysis of the superfluid irrotationality constraint .",
    "it should also be noted that our formalism is spiritually close to the extended thermodynamics approach ( this point will be discussed in detail elsewhere @xcite ) . this is an interesting reflection of the universality of conducting multi - fluid models .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that even though the single particle species model we consider here is not relevant for the conditions in the outer neutron star core it may nevertheless be of use for astrophysics modelling",
    ". it could be relevant for a low ( but finite ) temperature quark core in the colour - flavour - locked phase ( where a single condensate co - exists with a phonon gas @xcite ) . because of the potential relevance for gravitational - wave astronomy , studies of the oscillations and instabilities of such a model would be very interesting .",
    "this is a highly relevant problem since observations of these phenomena may shed light on the fundamental ground state of matter at extreme densities .",
    "we take as our starting point the flux - conservative multi - fluid framework developed by @xcite .",
    "we consider the simplest system corresponding to a single particle , heat conducting fluid that can undergo a transition to a superfluid state . in the canonical framework ,",
    "such systems have two degrees of freedom  the atoms are distinguished from the massless `` entropy '' . in the following , the former will be identified by a constituent index @xmath6 , while the latter is represented by @xmath7 .",
    "this description is different ( in spirit ) from the standard two - fluid model for helium , and it is relevant to investigate how the two models are related . in particular , we want to understand better the various dissipative terms that arise when the system is out of equilibrium .",
    "that is , we want to be able to compare our dissipative formalism to the results in the standard literature @xcite .",
    "our hope is that this will improve our understanding of the role of the thermal excitations .",
    "this would be an important step toward more realistic modelling of the various condensates that are expected to be present in a neutron star core .    our flux - conservative model @xcite combines the usual conservation laws for mass , energy and momentum with the results from a variational analysis @xcite .",
    "the latter is based on using the particle fluxes @xmath8 as the main variables and deducing the associated chemical potentials @xmath9 and the conjugate momenta @xmath10 .",
    "the variational analysis defines the canonical momentum associated with each flux , in the usual way .",
    "however , because of the so - called entrainment effect each momentum does not have to be parallel to the associated flux . in the case of a two - component system , with a single species of particle flowing with @xmath11 and a massless entropy with flux @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the particle number density and @xmath14 represents the entropy per unit volume , the momentum densities are _",

    "= . e s |_n , w_^2  , = . e w_^2 |_n , s  .    these relations highlight one of the main questions considered in this work .",
    "we want to understand the role and physical nature of the entrainment between particles and thermal excitations represented by the entropy fluid .",
    "this is very different from the entrainment that has so far been considered in neutron star models . in the most commonly studied context ,",
    "the entrainment between neutrons and protons arises because of the strong nuclear interaction .",
    "each neutron ( say ) is endowed with a virtual cloud of protons , leading to an effective mass different from the bare neutron mass @xcite . in the dynamical description ,",
    "this effect is represented by the entrainment .",
    "this mechanism is familiar from low - temperature systems , e.g. he@xmath2 where entrainment couples the two spin populations , and is well explained by landau fermi liquid theory @xcite . in this context it may seem somewhat unorthodox to consider `` entrainment '' between particles and entropy .",
    "however , such a mechanism arises naturally in the variational model , and it is clearly relevant to ask whether it plays an important role .",
    "in fact , if we consider the entrainment as altering the effective mass of a constituent , then it would be very natural for this mechanism to affect also the entropy .",
    "the entropy entrainment would simply represent the inertia associated with the heat flow .",
    "in our view , this interpretation is conceptually quite elegant and we want to understand to what extent it is useful in practice .    as discussed by @xcite , the associated momentum equations can be written and @xmath18 , respectively .",

    "this answers one of our initial questions : we now understand the role of the entropy entrainment that arises in a natural way within the variational framework .",
    "let us now move on to the dissipative problem . from",
    "we immediately see that in the dissipative case we need to augment ( [ mom1 ] ) by the divergence of d_ij = - g_ij - 2 ^_ij  .",

    "once we identify ^ = m^2 _ 3 , ^= m _ 4 we see that the two formulations agree perfectly .",
    "moreover , it is obvious that @xmath64 as required by the onsager symmetry .    in order to complete the comparison of the two models , we need to comment on the ( perhaps surprising ) absence of dissipative heat flux terms in our model . at first sight",
    ", this would seem to be at odds with the traditional description @xcite which contain fourier s law for the heat conductivity , @xmath65 . for consistency",
    ", our model requires @xmath66 , i.e. the thermal conductivity must vanish .",
    "is this an unattractive feature of our model ?",
    "in fact , it is not .",
    "first of all , it should be noted that the heat flux is intimately related to the entropy flow . in a two - component model",
    "one does not have the freedom to introduce an `` independent '' heat flux in addition to the massless entropy flux @xmath67 , without at the same time introducing a new dynamical degree of freedom . essentially , the model given by @xcite is a component model ( it certainly identifies three fluxes ) . that this makes sense physically",
    "is clear from the fact that the thermal conductivity in helium arises from the interaction between phonons and rotons @xcite , which can drift at different rates .",
    "our two - fluid model would be a valid representation of the cold regime where the condensate coexists with a single excitation component ( the thermal phonons ) .",
    "it is well - known that , the thermal conductivity @xmath68 vanishes in this case .",
    "the model is therefore relevant below 0.8  k or so , in the regime where the phonon dispersion relation is very close to linear .",
    "it is also relevant to comment on the well - known problems associated with fourier s law , i.e. the fact that it leads to a non - causal behaviour of thermal signals .",
    "this issue was one of the main motivations for the development of extended irreversible thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "a truly sound model for superfluid helium ought to reflect these developments . even though such a model is yet to be formulated",
    ", it is clear that our approach will allow us to make progress in this direction ( by introducing an additional component representing the rotons ) .",
    "this follows naturally from the discussion of @xcite where we demonstrate that the relaxation time associated with the entropy flux in heat conductivity problems is intimately related to the entrainment .",
    "we have now achieved the main objective of this work .",
    "we have demonstrated that our dissipative two - fluid formulation , with one of the fluids being associated with the massless entropy flow , reproduces the orthodox model for superfluid helium .",
    "this comparison is valuable since it enables us to draw experience for available results for the various dissipation coefficients , e.g. in terms of their effect on sound waves .",
    "it also demonstrates that it is straightforward to relate the variational formulation to standard microphysical calculations .",
    "perhaps , the most practical insight is that our analysis has explicitly shown that a full variational treatment of helium requires three , not two , fluid degrees of freedom .",
    "it remains to be seen how this will impact the variational formalism that has been much used to model superfluid neutron star dynamics .",
    "the analysis in the previous two sections provides useful insights into the dynamics of a single component superfluid at finite temperatures . from a conceptual point of view",
    ", it is obviously important to understand how the superfluid irrotationally constraint simplifies the dynamics of the two - fluid system , i.e. that the number of dissipation coefficients is reduced from nine to four .",
    "however , the final model may be of rather limited practical use .    in reality , the superfluid constraint is too severe .",
    "a superfluid can rotate by forming an array of vortices . to describe such a system",
    ", we must revert to the dissipative fluxes -",
    ". however , this more general description still fails to account for all dissipative channels in the problem . in particular",
    ", it does not easily accomodate the vortex mediated mutual friction force . in the simplest description @xcite",
    "we expect a force f_i^ =  _ n_v _ ijk ^j w_^k + _ n_v _ ijk ^klm ^j _",
    "l w_m^  , [ mf ] to act on the particles ( with a balancing force affecting the excitations ) . here",
    "@xmath69 is the vortex area density and @xmath70 represents the orientiation of the vortices ( the hat represents a unit vector ) @xcite .",
    "this force follows after averaging over a locally straight vortex array .    in @xcite",
    "we discussed how this force could be accounted for in our dissipative model .",
    "this analysis was not entirely successful .",
    "the main reason for this is that the variational description assumes that the system is isotropic .",
    "this is obviously no longer the case when one introduces an array of vortices with a preferred direction .",
    "this problem can be resolved in different ways .",
    "one can either add an additional `` fluid '' degree of freedom , representing the averaged vorticity , to the variational discussion ( see @xcite for interesting discussions and @xcite for a relativistic account ) .",
    "formally , this may be the most natural approach . in particular , since the mutual friction then arises as a linear friction associated with the drift of vortices relative to the excitations",
    ".    a more direct alternative would be to augment the analysis of the dissipative fluxes with the preferred direction @xmath71 .",
    "this leads to quite a large number of possible extra dissipative terms . to see this ,",
    "let us briefly return to - .",
    "these relations followed the assumption that the dissipative fluxes must be linear in the thermodynamical forces . as a result",
    ", a two index coefficient like @xmath72 can only be constructed out of the metric @xmath19 .",
    "if we have an additional vector in the problem , then a number of additional two - index objects can be written down .",
    "we can then have l^_ij = 2 ^ g_ij + _ 1 _ i _ j + _ 2 _ ijk ^k  .",
    "the force resulting from this expression can be written - f_i^= l^_ij w_^j = 2 ^ w^_i + _ 1 _ i ( _ j w_^j ) + _ 2 _ ijk ^k w_^j  .",
    "in order to compare this to we rewrite the latter as - f_i^ = n_v -  _ n_v _ ijk ^j w_^k  , and we see that we should identify 2 ^ = - _ 1 = n_v , _ 2 =  _ n_v  .",
    "this provides a simple and natural generalisation of the dissipative framework discussed in this paper . of course",
    ", it was designed only to account for the standard form of the vortex mutual friction .",
    "it does not in any way provide a completely general description of a system with vortices .",
    "such a model would allow a ( possibly quite large ) number of additional dissipative terms , and would be much more complicated .",
    "this would nevertheless be an interesting problem to consider .",
    "after all , we have not yet accounted for the vortex tension etcetera @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have developed a dissipative two - fluid model , based on distinguishing the particle flux from a massless entropy flow . correcting a conceptual mistake in a previous analysis",
    "@xcite we have formulated a general model for an isotropic system , which requires the determination of nine dissipation coefficients .",
    "we then demonstrated how imposing the constraint of irrotationality , which is expected for a ( pure ) superfluid , reduces the complexity of the problem .",
    "the final model is in one - to - one correspondence with the classic two - fluid model for he@xmath0 and we have provided a translation between the different variables .",
    "this comparison highlights the link between the entropy entrainment in our model and the `` normal fluid density '' in the standard description ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we discussed how the presence of vortices in the superfluid affects the model .",
    "in particular , we indicated how one may account for the vortex mediated mutual friction force .",
    "our final model should be directly applicable to low temperature , single `` particle species '' systems , ranging from laboratory systems to astrophysical objects .",
    "there is considerable scope for future developments in this problem area .",
    "first of all , it would be relevant to allow for causal dissipative heat flux terms , building on the discussion of @xcite .",
    "secondly , we want to use the experience gained here to develop finite temperature models for the different superfluid components expected to be present in a neutron star core .",
    "the final model discussed in this paper , essentially representing superfluid helium at low temperatures , may be immediately relevant ( in a certain temperature regime ) for a compact star with a colour superconducting quark core @xcite .",
    "further work is required to formulate a model for the coexisting neutron superfluid and proton superconductor expected in the outer core of a neutron star , as well as the neutron superfluid that penetrates such star s elastic inner crust .",
    "other exotic phases , like hyperon superfluids , may be even more complex .",
