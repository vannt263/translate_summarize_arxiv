    "the phenomenology related to the qcd confinement / deconfinement phase transition is nowadays a fascinating subject in the center of intense investigations , both experimentally and theoretically ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for a review of the topic ) . during the last two decades , a new state of matter",
    ", the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , has been intensively studied through heavy - ion collisions ( sps , rhic or lhc ) and is still carefully analysed .",
    "the experiments seem to conclude that the qgp behaves like a perfect fluid with a low ratio viscosity over entropy around the critical temperature of deconfinement @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , this observation suggests that a strongly - coupled phase ( called sqgp ) is present in this temperature range and that the qcd confinement / deconfinement phase transition is much more driven by screening effects of the strong interaction . in order to correctly describe the different mechanisms at work during this phase transition , or more exactly during this crossover ,",
    "a lot of theoretical researches ( lattice qcd , phenomenological approaches ... ) are carried out . in particular , finding the qgp equations of state ( eos ) is a crucial information nowadays needed .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate the thermodynamic features of the qgp by resorting to a phenomenological approach based on @xmath0-matrix computations .",
    "this approach has the advantage to allow the study of bound and scattering states of the system in a whole picture .",
    "relevant results have already been established for heavy - quarkonia above @xmath1 @xcite and also for glueballs in the yang - mills plasma @xcite . moreover , in this latter reference , the eos of the yang - mills plasma for su(n ) and g@xmath4 have been computed thanks to the dashen , ma and bernstein s formulation of statistical mechanics in terms of the @xmath5-matrix ( or @xmath6-matrix )  @xcite .",
    "such a formulation is particularly well suited for systems whose microscopic constituents behave according to relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the qgp is indeed identified to a quantum gas of gluons , quarks and antiquarks , which are seen as the effective degrees of freedom propagating in the plasma .",
    "this assumption is actually common to all the so - called quasiparticle approaches @xcite .",
    "however , thanks to the @xmath6-matrix formulation , the strongly - interacting regime can also be investigated here , in which bound states are expected to still survive above @xmath1 @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ tmatsec ] is a summary of the approach used here and about which detailed explanations can be found in @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ param ] , the model parameters are presented and discussed . in particular , the quasiparticle bare masses are extracted from the @xmath7 spectrum . in sec .",
    "[ bs_qgp ] , the binary bound state spectrum above @xmath1 is computed and analysed . then , the eos of the deconfined phase at zero baryonic potential are studied for @xmath2 and @xmath3 in sec .",

    "an exploratory work at small baryonic potential is carried out in sec .",
    "[ eos_qgp_mu ] .",
    "all our eos are compared to recent lattice qcd ( lqcd ) ones .",
    "our results are finally summarized in sec .",

    "the results of dashen , ma and bernstein @xcite establishing the grand potential of an interacting relativistic particle gas @xmath9 , expressed as an energy density , is given by ( in units where @xmath10 ) @xmath11\\text{.}\\ ] ] this equation is made of two parts .",
    "the first term @xmath12 refers to the grand canonical potential of the free relativistic ( quasi)particles , while the second term accounts for interactions in the plasma .",
    "this latter is made of a sum running on all the species , the number of particles included , and the quantum numbers necessary to fix a channel .",
    "the vectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 contain the chemical potentials and the particle number of each species taking part in a given scattering process .",
    "the set of all these channels is generically denoted @xmath15 . as usual , the chemical potential @xmath16 is the lagrange multiplier associated with the number of particles .",
    "it is a measure for the density of particles . in relativistic models ,",
    "the sign of @xmath16 is changed , passing from matter to antimatter . this parameter marks imbalance between matter and antimatter @xcite .",
    "one can notice that the contribution of the bound and scattering states are decoupled .",
    "the threshold @xmath17 is the summation on the masses of all the particles included in a given channel @xmath15 .",
    "below @xmath17 , bound states appearing as pole in the @xmath18-matrix ( equivalently @xmath0-matrix ) are added as free additional species : @xmath19 is the grand canonical potential describing a free relativistic gas of the @xmath15-channel bound states . above @xmath17 ,",
    "the scattering contribution is expressed as an integration depending on a trace , taken in the center - of - mass frame of the particles in the channel @xmath15 , and function of the @xmath18-matrix of the system .",
    "@xmath18 is in particular a function of the total energy @xmath20 .",
    "the symmetrizer @xmath21 enforces the pauli principle when a channel involving identical particles is considered , and the subscript @xmath22 means that only the connected scattering diagrams are taken into account .",
    "@xmath23 is the modified bessel function of the second kind and @xmath24 where @xmath0 is the temperature .",
    "the symbol @xmath25 denotes @xmath26 .    by definition ,",
    "@xmath18 is linked to off - shell @xmath0-matrix @xmath27 : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the free hamiltonian of the system . as in @xcite , we will only focus on two - body channels .",
    "so , a way to obtain @xmath27 is to solve the lippmann - schwinger equation , schematically given by @xmath30 with @xmath31 the free two - body propagator and @xmath32 the interaction potential .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for three - body channels , faddeev equations should be used in order to eliminate the spurious solution of the lippmann - schwinger equation @xcite .",
    "such considerations will be thus out of scope in this paper .",
    "once eq .",
    "( [ pot0 ] ) is computed , all thermodynamic observables can derived .",
    "for example , the pressure is simply given by @xmath33    the sum @xmath34 appearing in ( [ pot0 ] ) explicitly reads @xmath35 , where only two particles are involved in the interaction process , @xmath36 is a possible isospin channel , @xmath37 is the color channel , and @xmath38 is the spin / helicity channel ( the labels @xmath39 or @xmath40 must be dropped off if the charge conjugation or the parity are not defined ) .",
    "the normalized trace anomaly can also be computed by the following formula @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the stefan - boltzmann pressure .",
    "although we give here some results about the trace anomaly , it is mentioned in @xcite that some improvements must be done in order to obtain a fully reliable estimation of this quantity .",
    "assuming that the dominant scattering processes are the two - body ones , a key ingredient of the present approach is the two - body potential @xmath32 , encoding the interactions between the particles in the plasma . as in @xcite , @xmath32 is extracted from the static quenched su(3 ) lqcd free energy @xmath43 , between a @xmath44 pair in singlet representation at finite temperature @xcite , and then fitted with a cornell potential , screened thanks to the debye - hckel theory @xcite(see appendix  b in @xcite ) .",
    "note that unquenched lqcd results are also available in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , since these results are not significantly different from the quenched ones , the quenched potential is kept as basis of our computations , giving the accuracy expected in our work .    from that ,",
    "the internal energy @xmath45 is computed , @xmath46 , and considered as the interaction potential .",
    "this choice is still a matter of debate .",
    "nevertheless , it has given correct results in the ordinary ym case , as shown in @xcite .",
    "moreover in sec  [ qgp_3 ] , we will see that , according to our prescription for the quasiparticle masses , the internal energy is required to have a better agreement between our results and lqcd ones just above @xmath1 .",
    "no relativistic corrections will be taken into account for light - quark interactions within this paper .",
    "indeed , the quasiparticle quark masses used in our approach are large enough to assume static potentials at first approximation .",
    "nevertheless , this task is left for future works .",
    "moreover , all hyperfine interactions are neglected .",
    "we can expect that they are non - dominant with respect to the spin - independent contributions , since these processes are assumed to depend on the inverse square of the effective mass . with this hypothesis , we also miss the diagonal annihilation contributions .    finally , the casimir scaling is used to extract the leading - order gauge dependence of @xmath47 for @xmath48 , as proposed in sec .",
    "ii in @xcite .",
    "the casimir scaling means that potentials between colored sources are proportional to the eigenvalues of the quadratic casimir operator for their representation @xcite .",
    "it is the simplest color dependence for two color sources : it has indeed the same form as the one for the one - gluon exchange process .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to stress that the interaction considered within this paper contains other processes since it stems from a lqcd computation .",
    "let us note that the annihilation mechanism , which does not respect the casimir scaling , is a contact interaction and is then vanishing for all non - s states .",
    "moreover , it is worth mentioning that the casimir scaling seems very well respected between two static color sources in the @xmath49 sector @xcite .",
    "computations in the @xmath50 sector show a situation which is slightly different : the casimir scaling seems partly violated ( at most 20% ) for short distances and temperatures near @xmath1 @xcite . nevertheless in this work , as in @xcite , we assume that the casimir scaling is satisfied .",
    "the final form of the potential is thus the following one : @xmath51 ,   \\label{used_pot}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and where @xmath53 is the quadratic casimir of the representation @xmath54 .",

    "all the values taken by for the various color channels considered in this study are given in appendix  a in @xcite .",
    "let us note that the interaction can be attractive or repulsive .",
    "the normalization of is given by @xmath62 , since @xmath47 is fitted on a singlet @xmath44 potential for su(3 ) .",
    "we can also notice in that the long - distance behavior of the lattice potential @xmath63 , is subtracted .",
    "indeed , this term is assimilated , as suggested in @xcite , as a thermal mass contribution for the quasiparticles .",
    "moreover , it ensures the convergence of the scattering equation and the possibility to perform the fourier transform .    when the quasiparticles are infinitely separated , the only remaining potential energy can be seen as a manifestation of the in - medium self - energy effects , @xmath64 .",
    "we thus encode these effects as a mass shift @xmath65 to the  bare \" quasiparticle mass @xmath66 , by following the arguments exposed in @xcite : @xmath67 in order to get the thermal mass for any particles , the first - order color dependence is extracted in agreement with the hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) leading - order behavior @xcite : @xmath68 where the quantity @xmath69 is assumed to be color - independent . as @xmath47 is fitted on a singlet @xmath44 potential for @xmath70 , we have here @xmath71 for further details about the behavior of @xmath72 , one can refer to sec .",
    "v in @xcite and to sec .",
    "[ param ] in this paper . at this stage ,",
    "one has to have in mind that chiral symmetry is not taken into account in our formalism .",
    "comments about that issue will be given in the conclusions .",
    "the lippman - schwinger equation leading to the on - shell @xmath0-matrix can be computed from as in @xcite : @xmath73 \\left[1 \\pm f_{p2}(\\epsilon_2)\\right ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the energy in the center - of - mass frame , @xmath74 the asymptotic energy of the particle @xmath58 , and where the free two - body propagator is computed thanks to the blanckenbecler - sugar ( bbs ) reduction scheme .",
    "its explicit form is given in appendix  c in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the in - medium effects , namely the bose - enhancement and the pauli - blocking are included following @xcite .",
    "@xmath75 is thus the distribution function of the @xmath76-species : @xmath77 the @xmath78 stands for bosons while the @xmath79 for fermions , and @xmath16 is a possible chemical potential .",
    "the sign choice in also depends on the nature of the particles : @xmath79 for bosons and @xmath78 for fermions .",
    "let us note that the impact of these in - medium effects on our eos is very small .",
    "therefore , the results obtained in @xcite remain valid .",
    "concerning the interaction potential @xmath80 entering in  , it is obtained by the fourier transform of the interaction extracted in lqcd .",
    "since our potential has a spherical symmetry , we have @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the angle between the momenta @xmath84 and @xmath85 .    for channels given by ordinary @xmath86 states",
    ", @xmath80 is obtained from @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the legendre polynomial of order @xmath89 . the spin @xmath18 is not indicated since our interaction is spin - independent .    when at least one particle is transverse , the helicity formalism @xcite has to be used .",
    "it is then very convenient to decompose a helicity state in the basis states @xmath86 in order to perform the computations . for a particular helicity state @xmath90",
    ", it reads @xmath91 then , it can be shown that @xmath92 since our interaction is spin - independent .",
    "all the helicity states needed for this study are listed in appendix  b in @xcite .",
    "the haftel - tabakin algorithm is a reliable procedure to solve the @xmath0-matrix problem @xcite .",
    "the momentum integral is discretized within an appropriate quadrature , thus turning the integral equation into a matrix equation , namely @xmath93 , where schematically , @xmath94 and where @xmath95 denotes the integration weight .",
    "the solution follows trivially by matrix inversion .",
    "bound states are naturally poles below @xmath17 .",
    "an interesting criterion for finding them is to use the determinant of the transition function @xmath96 ( referred to as the fredholm determinant ) since it vanishes at the bound state energies @xcite .",
    "finally , once @xmath97 is known , the on - shell @xmath0-matrix is readily obtained as @xmath98 , with @xmath99 given by @xmath100",
    "before fixing the parameters and applying the general formalism described in the previous section to the @xmath101 qgp , let us discuss some general assumptions that we have done within this model .    in our approach",

    "@xmath104 ) , the strange ( anti)quarks ( @xmath105 , resp .",
    "@xmath106 ) and the heavy ( anti)quarks ( @xmath22 and @xmath107 , resp . @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) . the ( anti)quarks are spin-1/2 particles belonging to fundamental ( conjugate ) representation of the gauge group . despite their nonvanishing mass ,",
    "the gluons are transverse spin-1 bosons in the adjoint representation .",
    "the gluon mass is dynamically generated by self - energy effects , which does not imply a drastic change of their nature .",
    "it has been shown that the gluon must be considered as a transverse spin-1 boson to reproduce correctly the expected glueball spectra at @xmath7 @xcite . moreover ,",
    "some lattice data support the presence of massive transverse modes only in a gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "the two - body channels to be considered are @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath44 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the lowest corresponding spin / helicity states are given in appendix  b of @xcite , and the possible color channels can be found in appendix  a of @xcite . within this study , we only focus on the su(3 ) gauge group .",
    "let us examine the different possibilities of interactions :    * as explained above , the interaction ( [ used_pot ] ) between two gluons or two quarks follows strictly the casimir scaling and neglects all hyperfine corrections , annihilation ones included . *",
    "although this interaction is expected to take into account complicated exchanges ( since it stems from a lqcd calculation ) , it is interesting to look at the simplest possible feynman diagrams between two particles .",
    "two gluons or two quarks can exchange a gluon , but the basic gluon - quark interaction is a quark exchange .",
    "so the choice ( [ color_scaling ] ) for the color factor is questionable for this particular interaction . to correct",
    "this point is beyond the scope of this work , but it is worth mentioning that the contributions of the @xmath113 and @xmath114 interactions is expected to be very weak in our model ( see sec .",
    "[ eos_qgp ] ) .",
    "* processes transforming a @xmath110 pair into a @xmath115 pair exist , but we have checked that mechanisms of order 1 are naturally suppressed since there is no overlap between @xmath110 and @xmath115 states @xcite .",
    "as we neglect second order processes , as hyperfine interactions , we do not take into account transition between @xmath110 and @xmath115 pairs .      in order to fix our parameters for starting the computations at finite temperature , and to check the validity of our model",
    ", some pieces of information can be extracted from the @xmath7 bound state spectrum as in @xcite .    in quenched su(3 ) lattice qcd , the potential between a static quark - antiquark pair at zero temperature is compatible with the funnel form @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119  gev@xmath120 ( standard values for the running coupling constant @xmath121 and the string tension @xmath122 at @xmath49 ) .",
    "again , we neglect the contributions of annihilation processes . since the fourier transform of @xmath123 is not defined ( because of a non - zero asymptotic value )",
    ", a string - breaking value @xmath124 , has to be introduced in order to make it convergent @xcite .",
    "@xmath124 is thus seen as the energy above which a light quark - antiquark pair can be created from the vacuum and breaks the qcd string .",
    "this scale is then subtracted and the potential effectively taken into account is @xmath125 , while @xmath126 is interpreted as an effective quark mass using the same arguments as those detailed in sec .  [ properties ] .    according to the color scaling ,",
    "the potential describing the interactions between two color sources ( with representations @xmath54 and @xmath127 ) at zero temperature , is @xmath128 since @xmath129 .",
    "the factor @xmath130 appears since the potential @xmath131 is fitted on a singlet @xmath44 pair for a su(3 ) gauge group . in this case , @xmath132 should rather be interpreted as the energy scale necessary to form two sources of color compatible with the existence of the two new color singlet pairs of particles created by the string breaking . as in @xcite , if @xmath66 is the bare mass of the particle , the @xmath49 mass @xmath133 , used to compute the bound state is then @xmath134 keeping the same structure as in .",
    "the zero - temperature spectrum of the theory can be computed by solving with the potential  . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ lseq ] , instead of looking at the pole of the @xmath0-matrix , the zeros of @xmath135 are computed in order to establish the bound state spectrum .    the lightest glueball spectrum , namely the @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , has already been computed in @xcite . the parameters , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , were respectively fixed to 2  gev and 0.7 gev .",
    "@xmath139 is in agreement with lattice data showing that the mass of the lightest gluelump is given by @xmath141  gev @xcite , while @xmath140 is an acceptable value for the zero - momentum limit of the gluon propagator at zero temperature in view of previous studies locating this mass typically between 500 and 700 mev ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , let us add that , unlike in the glueball case , the @xmath7 meson mass depends on the gauge group since @xmath146 depends on it ( see appendix  a in @xcite ) . within our approach , such study is not difficult to carry out .",
    "the meson mass dependence in function of the gauge group is not studied here , since the principal interest of the @xmath0-matrix computations at @xmath7 is to extract and to check the parameters we will use at @xmath147 . in this regard , let us note that only the quasiparticle bare masses will enter in our computations at @xmath147 and not the string breaking @xmath124 .",
    "what can be said however about the gauge - group dependence is that , in the case of su(@xmath148 ) , the meson masses are of order 1 as expected , see conclusions for more comments about this .",
    "the last global parameter that has to be fixed within our approach is the critical temperature of deconfinement @xmath1 .",
    "as we fit our interactions on lattice calculations , the definition of @xmath1 comes from these approaches : the color averaged as well as the singlet free energy of a quark - antiquark pair will tend towards finite nonzero values for all temperatures @xmath48 ( and diverge below @xmath1 ) . in @xcite ,",
    "a value of 0.3 gev was used since the focus was only on the gluon sector . here , in order to stay coherent with current lattice data , @xmath1 is moved to 0.15 gev .",
    "this change naturally modifies the thermodynamics in the gluon sector that was established in @xcite .",
    "let us discuss this point .",
    "first of all , let us set @xmath149 .",
    "the two - body interaction potential between particles only depends on @xmath150 as it can be explicitly shown from its expression given in appendix  b of @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is the same for the gluon thermal mass @xmath151 , according to .",
    "moreover , since the effect of the bose - enhancement can be considered as negligible , it can also be assumed that the @xmath0-matrix @xmath152 , is only a function of @xmath150 .    in fig .",
    "[ comparetemp ] , the @xmath1-impact is analyzed for the pure gauge eos with @xmath153 0.15 and 0.30 gev , all other parameters remaining fixed . the way to compute these eos is given in @xcite and will be recalled in sec .",
    "[ gen_eos ] .",
    "as it can be noticed , the general behavior is not the same and the normalized pressure seems to increase when @xmath1 increases .",
    "it is especially worth remarking that , if we only consider the contribution of the quasiparticle ideal gas , @xmath1 has an impact on the thermodynamics .",
    "indeed , the pressure depends on the ratio @xmath154 , depending on @xmath1 for a fixed @xmath150 .    , and trace anomaly @xmath155 ( without bound states ) versus temperature in units of @xmath1 ( with @xmath156 and 0.3  gev).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ] , and trace anomaly @xmath155 ( without bound states ) versus temperature in units of @xmath1 ( with @xmath156 and 0.3  gev).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the behavior of the normalized trace anomaly ( without bound states ) is also presented in fig .

    "unfortunately at the present stage , some problems also appear in our formalism .",

    "let us mention for instance , the absence of a helicity formalism for many - body systems in a potential approach , and the necessity to resort to faddeev and higher equations for more than two - body interactions .",

    "no lqcd data are available to our knowledge .",
    "it is not only important to define the potential between particles but also the quasiparticle mass , which seems to rule the main behavior of the eos at @xmath226 .",
    "a way to circumvent this problem could be to use the htl expressions for the particle thermal mass , but it was not the bias adopted within this study .",
    "indeed , the actual shape of our thermal masses are not the ones extracted from htl .    for all these reasons , the study that follows will be only limited to small baryonic potentials .",
    "we will thus keep the restriction to two - body interactions which can make sense in such a @xmath16-range .",
    "moreover , the interaction potential and the quasiparticle thermal masses are the same as the ones used up to now , without the inclusion of the baryonic potential . of course , the obtained results must be considered as preliminary and are just intended to draw a general tendency .",

    "the present work is part of a program aiming at studying the thermodynamic properties of gauge theories in the deconfined phase .",
    "the interested reader may read @xcite and @xcite for pure ym and susy ym theories , while this paper is devoted to the  realistic \" quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the framework developed is based on a @xmath0-matrix formulation of statistical mechanics , in which the thermal masses and two - body interactions are derived from the static potential between fundamental color source computed in quenched lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "apart from the potential , the only remaining parameters are the value of @xmath1 and the bare quark masses .",
    "these masses are fitted on the meson spectrum at zero temperature .",
    "the main assumption underlying our model is actually that a quasiparticle picture of deconfined matter just above deconfinement is relevant . although it is not a rigorous proof , the nice agreement between our computed equations of state an the recent lattice data of refs .",
    "@xcite can be seen as an _ a posteriori _ validation of our framework .",
    "* both the free energy or the internal energy could be used as potential terms in our model .",
    "it appears that , keeping the same procedure and the same values for the parameters , only the internal energy is able to generate an equation of state which has the qualitative features of the lattice equation of state .",
    "the internal energy thus appears as the most relevant potential within in our framework and leads to a good agreement with the lattice equation of state .",
    "note that this problem is far from being elucidated , see for example the recent work @xcite , where the opposite conclusion is reached . * between 1 and 2 @xmath1 , color interactions are strong enough to create mesons ,",
    "_ i.e. _ a quark - antiquark bound state in a color singlet .",
    "mesons made of one or two light quarks are almost all dissociated in @xmath1 .",
    "only mesons made of two heavy quarks ( @xmath22 , @xmath107 ) are bound enough to survive in the range @xmath235 @xmath1 .",
    "although we use a @xmath0-matrix formulation as well , our parameters have different values of that used in @xcite where the main goal was to reproduce mesonic correlators computed on the lattice and not the equation of state . in this last work ,",
    "the @xmath174 meson is bound up to 3 @xmath1 and the @xmath175 meson is bound up to 3.5 @xmath1 , thus at much higher @xmath0 than what we find .",
    "it is worth recalling that we are able to compute @xmath0-matrices in channels where the quark and the antiquark have different masses , which was not considered in @xcite . *",
    "although strong in the color singlet channel , the contribution of two - body interactions to the equation of state is weak with respect to the free - gas part .",
    "this is partly due to a cancellation between attractive and repulsive color channels , that come with an opposite sign in the grand potential .",
    "it is tempting to conclude from this result that it provides an _ a posteriori _ justification of the success of approaches involving free quasiparticles in the description of the equation of state , even in the strongly coupled phase .",
    "an obvious drawback of our framework is the neglect of chiral symmetry , leading to results that may be inaccurate in the light quark sector .",
    "qcd in coulomb gauge is currently the formalism which is maximally close to ours while fully including chiral symmetry .",
    "some work has been done in the study of pure yang - mills theory and by using a toy model with confining potential that mimics qcd @xcite .",
    "modelling the full quark - gluon plasma within coulomb gauge qcd is however a huge task that still remains to be achieved .",
    "some comments can be made about the large-@xmath148 behavior of our results .",
    "the meson masses depend on the number of color through the factor @xmath236 only , so the meson masses are of order 1 at large @xmath148 , with corrections in @xmath237 as expected from a quenched potential .",
    "moreover , it has been shown in @xcite that the quark contribution to the equation of state behaves as @xmath238 in t hooft s limit , as expected .",
    "this is an important check of the ability of the present model to deal with the large-@xmath148 limit .",
    "future developments of the present model should include the computation of the viscosity - over - entropy ratio .",
    "such a computation can in principle be done without extra parameter .",
    "hence , it is an important extension of our formalism that we hope to present in forthcoming works .",
