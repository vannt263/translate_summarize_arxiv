    "hyperfine spectroscopy is very important tool in study of atomic and nuclear physics , especially which can be used to check fundamental interaction @xcite such as electromagnetic and electroweak interaction with high accuracy , determine nuclear properties @xcite , develop atomic clock @xcite , and so on .",
    "recently one kind of hyperfine transitions , which is known as hyperfine induced transition or hyperfine quenching , attracts more attention owing to analyzing spectra @xcite , determining isotopic ratios in stellar and diagnosing low - density plasma @xcite besides those reasons mentioned above .",
    "many theoretical researches have been made to predict hyperfine induced transition probability based on different method .",
    "the most important problem in the calculations of hyperfine quenching rate is how to treat the hyperfine interaction and the interaction with electromagnetic field . in the past decades",
    ", three methods have been developed to solve such problem , i.e. perturbative method @xcite , complex matrix method @xcite and radiative damping method @xcite .",
    "they have individual merit and shortage in actual physical problems as shown in ref . @xcite . here",
    "we used perturbative method to evaluate hyperfine quenching rate , that is , the computations of the probability follow the determinations of hyperfine structure .",
    "this approach is valid as long as radiative widths are smaller than the fine separation between concerned levels .",
    "the crucial point is to properly choice perturbative states involved in because the differences of results calculated by different approximate model are sometimes very large .",
    "for hyperfine induced @xmath1 transition of be - like ions there have been several studies .",
    "et al . _ firstly computed the probabilities using their developing complex matrix method @xcite .",
    "however , in their computational model they neglected an important contribution from the @xmath6 level , which lead to a relative large discrepancy compared to the later theoretical @xcite and experimental value @xcite . once again , brage _ et al .",
    "_ gave some of transition rates by means of perturbative method in order to determine the isotopic of composition and diagnose densities of low - density plasmas@xcite . in their investigation the influence of @xmath6 level on hyperfine induced @xmath1 transition of be - like ions were indicated .",
    "but the calculations were restricted within those abundant elements in stellar .",
    "later , schippers _",
    "measured the probability for be - like ti ions using resonant electron - ion recombination method in the heavy - ion storage ring tsr of max - planck institute for nuclear physics , heidelberg , germany @xcite .",
    "the experimental result was almost 60% larger than marques _",
    "theoretical value .",
    "this led to cheng _",
    "renewedly calculating this decay rate along be - like isoelectronic sequence by perturbative and radiative damping method @xcite .",
    "the latest theoretical results reduced the discrepancy to 20% .",
    "their investigations shown again that the contribution from @xmath6 transition amplitude and the interference effect from @xmath7 and @xmath6 perturbative states on hyperfine induced @xmath8 transition of be - like ions can not be neglected .",
    "even though , it seems that characteristic about interference effects in hyperfine induced @xmath9 transition of be - like ions were still not very clear to be revealed .",
    "as we know , @xmath10 level is another metastable state of sp configuration .",
    "it can decay to the excited state @xmath11 by magnetic dipole ( m1 ) transition and to the ground state by magnetic quadurpole ( m2 ) transition with large branch ratio .",
    "many publications have been concerned with determination of the probabilities @xcite to diagnose the low - density plasma and to probe relativistic and qed effects by accurate transition energy and probability .",
    "however , information about another transition process , that is , hyperfine induced e1 transition is very scarce . while , gould _",
    "et al . _ and",
    "andersson _ et al .",
    "_ have pointed out significant influences of hyperfine induced e1 transition on the lifetime of @xmath10 level in he - like @xcite and zn - like ions @xcite , respectively .",
    "have also shown that quantum interference between the e1 transition of hyperfine induced and m2 transition has obvious effects on increasing the degree of linear polarization of @xmath12 in he - like ions @xcite , which can affect the modelling and diagnostics of high - temperature astrophysical and laboratory plasmas with an anisotropic non - maxwellian velocity distribution of energetic electrons .    based on these reasons mentioned above ,",
    "we further investigated hyperfine induced @xmath13 transition of be - like ions in detail using grasp2k @xcite based on multi - configuration dirac - fock and hfst @xcite packages .",
    "the regular of interference effects for hyperfine induced @xmath14 transition of be - like ions was shown .",
    "in particular , it was found that the trends of interference effects with atomic number @xmath2 in such two transitions are not monotone .",
    "in the present of hyperfine interactions , which couple the nuclear * @xmath15 * and electronic * @xmath16 * angular momenta to a total angular momenta * @xmath17 * , only * @xmath18 * and @xmath19 are good quantum number other than the electronic angular momenta * @xmath16 * and @xmath20 .",
    "then , the wave function for the system can be written by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the mixing coefficients due to hyperfine interaction , and are obtained in first order perturbation theory as the ratio between the off - diagonal hyperfine matrix elements and the unperturbed energy differences @xmath23 the subscript 0 labels the concerned level .",

    "procedure both the radial parts of the orbitals and the expansion coefficients are optimized to self - consistency . in the present work",

    "however , this is invalid when shells are multiply occupied , and the diagonal energy parameters of correlation orbitals with small occupation numbers may be large positive quantities totally unrelated to binding energies @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the zero - frequency limit have been adopted in present calculations . in the configuration interaction calculations the main quantum electrodynamics ( qed )",
    "effects can also be included .",
    "tensor algebra used for evaluating hyperfine and electric dipole matrix elements between ci wave functions assumes that the wave functions are built from a common orbital set .",
    "this is a severe restriction since high - quality wave functions demands orbitals optimized for the specific state . to relax this and to be able to compute matrix elements between wave functions built from independently optimized orbital sets ,",
    "biorthogonal transformation techniques introduced by malmqvist can be used @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the calculated hyperfine induced transition rate depends on the number of perturbative states in eq . ( 11 ) and on the accuracy of the electronic matrix elements . in practical calculation of hyperfine",

    "( 11 ) is can be simplified to @xmath59 the differences for these two transitions concentrate on different hyperfine mixing coefficient @xmath60 and transition energy @xmath43 . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( 16 ) , there exist interference effects caused by the @xmath11 and @xmath61 two transition amplitudes .",
    "the accuracy of the electronic matrix elements involved in above formula was determined by wavefunction of electronic part .",
    "the main uncertainty in calculation of the wavefunctions comes from electron correlation effects , especially for low charged ions .",
    "for instance c@xmath62 ions , those matrix elements are fair sensitive to electronic correlation effects @xcite .",
    "therefore , it must be considered very carfully . as a starting point scf calculations were done for the configurations in the even and odd state complex . in the calculations",
    "the wavefunctions of @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 were determined in extended optimal level ( eol ) calculations @xcite , respectively . these calculation",
    "were followed by calculations with expansions including configuration state functions obtained by single(s ) and double(d)-excitations from , respectively , the studied even and odd state reference configurations to active sets of orbitals @xmath66 . while for c@xmath62 the active set was expanded to @xmath67 , and for n@xmath68 and f@xmath69 to @xmath70 in order to obtain satisfied results .",
    "the active sets were systematically increased allowing computed properties to be monitored . due to stability problems in the relativistic scf procedure only the outermost layers of orbitals",
    "could be optimized each time .",
    "the scf calculations were followed by ci calculations in which part of core - valence and core - core correlations , the frequency independent breit interaction and qed effects was included .",
    "finally , the hyperfine induced transition probability can be obtained by above mentioned theoretical method using hfst package @xcite .      in table 1",
    "we listed our calculated results for hyperfine induced transition probability as well as other theoretical and experimental value@xcite .",
    "nuclear parameters of concerned isotopes for be - like ions were taken from @xcite . as can be seen from table 1 , results of marques _",
    "_ obviously deviate from others because two problems .",
    "one is that they neglected the contribution of @xmath61 to hyperfine quenching rate of @xmath71 , and the other is that a ratio factor in transition rate was omitted in their method @xcite .",
    "the present calculational results displayed in the forth column in table 1 are in agreement with others for @xmath72 , but not for ions with @xmath73 .",
    "the reason for this is we neglected high order breit interactions and qed effects in electronic wavefunction calculations , which lead to quite large errors in transition energy for high - z ions . due to limits of present method",
    ", we have not intrinsically solved this problem .",
    "hence experimental @xcite and some of other accurate theoretical transition energies @xcite were used to correct the hyperfine induced transition probability of @xmath71 levle .",
    "those corrected ones were presented in the fifth column of table 1 . it can be found that the consistence becomes obviously better with brage _ et al . _ and cheng _",
    "et al . _ calculational value .",
    "while for be - like @xmath74rh ion the two order of magnitude difference is because different magnetic dipole moment was used . based on this",
    ", we used the same method to correct other transition rates in next computations as well .    in table 2",
    "we presented hyperfine quenching rate of @xmath10 in connection with corresponding transition energies used to correct those rates .",
    "since angular momentum @xmath16 of @xmath10 state unequal zero , it splits into several hyperfine levels , labeled by total angular momentum @xmath18 . for individual hyperfine level satisfying select rule of electric dipole can occur hyperfine induced e1 transition , and this transition rate is dependent on angular number @xmath18 and nuclear parameters .    due to lack of other results about hyperfine induced @xmath5 transition probability we can not make comparison . in order to confirm the rates",
    "is reliable , therefore , we further evaluated @xmath5 m2 and @xmath75 m1 transition probabilities using our calculated line strength and experimental transition energies .",
    "these results as well as other theoretical values were displayed in table 3 .",
    "as can be seen from this table , the consistence among these results is quite good .",
    "it is indicated that our calculational hyperfine quenching rates of @xmath10 level are credible .",
    "brage _ et al .",
    "_ and cheng _ et al .",
    "_ have dictated that interference effects strongly affect hyperfine quenching rate of @xmath71 @xcite . from eq.(16 ) , we know that this effect occur in hyperfine quenching of @xmath10 as well . to show clearly this phenomena , independent nuclear parameter of the transition amplitudes contributed from @xmath11 and @xmath61",
    "were plotted in fig .",
    "1 . as can be seen from this picture , the interference effects work within a wide range of atomic number due to non - monotone change of transition amplitude contributed by @xmath61 .",
    "it is interesting that the trend of transition amplitude with z is similar between those two hyperfine quenching .",
    "an obvious difference is that the transition amplitude of @xmath61 is dominant in @xmath76 e1 transition while @xmath11 for @xmath9 e1 transition .    in order to reveal characteristic of the interference effects in such hyperfine induced @xmath0 transition of be - like ions , it is convenience to define a function , @xmath77 , that proportion to the ratio between the two transition amplitudes .",
    "for example , for @xmath1 transition , @xmath78 according to the formula , the closer @xmath77 is to 0 , the stronger interference effect is .",
    "therefore , it clearly show the extent of interference effects . the trend of @xmath77 with z for @xmath71 and @xmath10 is plotted in fig .",
    "2 , respectively .",
    "it worth noting from this picture that the interference effects in these two hyperfine quenching do not change monotonically and there exist minimum value for @xmath79 near @xmath3 and near @xmath4 for @xmath80 .",
    "hence , the strongest interference effect occurs near @xmath3 for @xmath1 e1 transition , and near @xmath4 for @xmath5 e1 transition .",
    "in conclusion , we have calculated the hyperfine induced @xmath81 e1 transition probability of be - like ions using grasp2k based on multiconfiguration dirac - fock method and hfst packages .",
    "the interference effects resulted from @xmath11 and @xmath61 perturbative states in those two hyperfine quenching of @xmath0 were studied in detail .",
    "it worth noting that the trends of interference effects with atomic number @xmath2 in such two transitions are not monotone .",
    "the strongest interference effect occurs near @xmath3 for @xmath1 e1 transition , and near @xmath4 for @xmath5 e1 transition .",
