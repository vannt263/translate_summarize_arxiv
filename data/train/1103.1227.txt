    "although the classical linear multi - step algorithms are very known and utilized , the lil characteristics ( convergence properties , time stability and applications results ) show that this numerical method could be considered as an interesting alternative to the widely used formulas .",
    "the backward approximation of derivatives implies null coefficients of the odd order derivatives which represent a major advantage for the propagation of errors .    as a comparative test two simple odes with known analytical solutions and a chaotic continuous - time dynamical system , first studied by fabrikant and rabinovich [ 6 ] and recent",
