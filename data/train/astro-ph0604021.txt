    "the complex chemistry of interstellar clouds originates from reactions taking place both in the gas phase and on the surfaces of dust grains .",
    "the most important surface reaction is the formation of molecular hydrogen , which is highly inefficient in the gas phase @xcite .",
    "accordingly , there has been much recent interest in developing accurate and efficient methods for the modelling of chemical reactions taking place on dust grain surfaces @xcite .",
    "the most widespread approach for treating networks involving both surface and gas phase reactions is based on chemical rate equations , where the populations of different species are described by continuous concentration variables and the rate of production of a species is proportional to the product of the concentrations of its constituents @xcite .",
    "however , rate equations become inappropriate for small grains subject to low fluxes of reactants , because the concept of a continuous concentration is questionable when the typical number of reactants on a grain drops below unity @xcite . in this regime",
    "it is necessary to consider the full probability distribution @xmath0 of the number of reactants @xmath1 on the grain ( say , the number of h atoms ) , either within a stochastic monte carlo simulation @xcite or by solving the master equation governing the time evolution of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "none of the three modelling approaches mentioned above takes explicit account of the process by which reactants migrate and meet on the grain surface , through thermal hopping or quantum tunnelling .",
    "all such spatial aspects of the problem are instead lumped into the _ sweeping rate _",
    "@xmath2 , which is usually defined as the inverse of the time required for a single atom to visit all @xmath3 adsorption sites on the grain , and is taken to be of the form @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the rate of hops between neighboring adsorption sites .",
    "this expression is problematic for two reasons .",
    "first , since a random walker in two dimensions occasionally revisits a site , it requires more than @xmath3 hops to explore the entire surface @xcite .",
    "second , and more fundamentally , the actual process of interest  the joint diffusion of two atoms which terminates when either one of them desorbs , or the two meet and react  is distinct from , and not simply related to , the exploration of the grain by a single atom . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "so far the only approach that overcomes these limitations is the fully microscopic monte carlo simulation of the hopping and reaction of molecules on the lattice of adsorption sites @xcite , which can not be used for the modelling of large reaction networks over long times .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide a consistent definition of the true sweeping rate , and to show how it can be evaluated exactly for a spherical grain . in sect .  [ encountersweeping ] we establish a transparent interpretation of the sweeping rate and express it in terms of the encounter probability of a pair of atoms on the grain",
    "this encounter probability is calculated for a spherical grain in sect .",
    "[ penccalc ] , and two regimes of parameters are identified , for which there are simple approximate results .",
    "this section also highlights a quantitative relation between the encounter probability and the deviation of the distribution of the number of reactants on the grain from a poisson distribution . in sect .",
    "[ sweepingrate ] the results are used to obtain the true sweeping rate in terms of physical parameters , which is then compared to the conventional approximation .",
    "we find that the true sweeping rate is reduced considerably , and the effect is most pronounced for large grains .",
    "random walk considerations are employed to reproduce asymptotically exact expressions .",
    "we then examine the effect of using the true sweeping rate on the recombination efficiency ( as a function of grain size and of grain temperature ) in sect .",
    "[ recombination ] , for a set of physical parameters that has been used in other work , and that enables us to compare our results to those of microscopic monte carlo simulations . a summary and our conclusions are presented in sect .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "we focus the discussion on the specific case of hydrogen recombination , but expect the results to be relevant also for other , more complex diffusion - mediated reactions .",
    "we consider a grain subject to a flux @xmath6 of h atoms per unit time , which can desorb at rate @xmath7 .",
    "once formed , molecular hydrogen is assumed to desorb rapidly , or at least not to affect the diffusion and reaction of h atoms .",
    "the standard rate equation governing the mean number @xmath8 of h atoms on the grain then reads @xcite @xmath9 the sweeping rate @xmath2 appears in the last term on the right hand side , which contains the key approximation inherent in the rate equation method , i.e.  setting the reaction rate proportional to the product of the mean numbers of reactants .",
    "since each reaction consumes two atoms , the recombination rate is thus taken to be @xmath10 within the master equation treatment , this is replaced by the expression @xcite @xmath11 which correctly accounts for the fact that the reaction rate is proportional to the number of _ pairs _ of atoms , and hence vanishes when @xmath12",
    ". equations ( [ rate2 ] ) and ( [ master ] ) are seen to be identical whenever @xmath13 , i.e.  when the variance of the distribution @xmath0 of the reactant number equals its mean .",
    "this is a defining property of the poisson distribution , which holds irrespective of the mean of the distribution .",
    "the comparison of ( [ rate2 ] ) and ( [ master ] ) shows that a failure of the rate equation approach , in the sense of a large discrepancy between the two expressions , is not necessarily implied when the mean number of h atoms @xmath8 becomes small compared to unity @xcite .",
    "the rate equation can be safely applied to any arbitrarily small region of a macroscopic surface , as long as atoms can freely enter and exit to ensure that the poisson statistics of the number of reactants in the region is maintained .",
    "rather , the failure of the rate equation ( [ rate ] ) on small grains is a consequence of the _ confinement _ of the reactants on the grain surface , which implies that every adsorption site is visited many times and the probability for the two reactants to meet is sharply enhanced . as a consequence , the probability to find two atoms simultaneously on the grain is strongly reduced compared to the poisson distribution , and @xmath14 .",
    "a precise quantitative relation between the encounter probability for two atoms and the deviation of @xmath0 from a poisson distribution will be given below in sect .",
    "[ nonpoisson ] .    the expression ( [ master ] )",
    "provides a transparent interpretation of the sweeping rate @xmath2 : since the number of pairs of atoms on the grain is @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the rate at which _ pairs of atoms are removed by the reaction_. the alternative pathway for a pair to disappear is through the desorption of one of its constituents , which occurs at rate @xmath17 . we conclude that the probability @xmath18 for a pair of atoms to meet and react before one of them desorbs is given by @xmath19 conversely , the relation ( [ penc1 ] ) can be used to express the sweeping rate in terms of @xmath18 as @xmath20 in the next section we show how @xmath18 can be computed analytically in terms of the model parameters .",
    "since the confined geometry plays an important role for the sweeping rate , we need to specify the shape of the grain .",
    "we will treat the simplest case of a sphere , which has the crucial advantage that all adsorption sites are equivalent .",
    "this is in contrast e.g.  to the disc geometry employed previously in a similar calculation @xcite .",
    "the definition of the encounter probability involves a pair of atoms , each of which hops to adjacent adsorption sites at rate @xmath5 and desorbs at rate @xmath7 . because of translational invariance on the surface of the sphere , this situation is equivalent to that of a single particle moving with the double hopping rate @xmath21 and desorbing at twice the rate @xmath17 , while the other atom remains fixed and present all the time . as we are only concerned with the encounter probability ( as opposed to the time of encounter ) , multiplying both rates by a common factor of 2 does not change the result [ compare to ( [ penc1 ] ) ] ; hence we revert to the original rates @xmath5 and @xmath7 for the moving particle and keep the second particle fixed and present throughout .      following the approach of @xcite , the next step consists in passing to a continuum limit in which the occupation probability @xmath22 of the moving atom satisfies a stationary diffusion equation .",
    "the spherical grain has a radius @xmath23 , while the fixed ` target atom ' is modelled as a circular surface area of radius @xmath24 , located at the north pole of the sphere . since we assume the grain to be large enough to contain at least a few hundred adsorption sites , @xmath25 . in the original discrete setting the sphere",
    "is tiled by adsorption sites forming some regular lattice .",
    "the radius @xmath24 of the target atom then corresponds to a distance of @xmath26 between adjacent adsorption sites . in the appendix  [ gderivation ]",
    "it is shown for some common lattice structures that the number of adsorption sites is given by @xmath27 where the factor @xmath28 reflects the lattice geometry .",
    "the diffusion constant @xmath29 for a two - dimensional random walk on the lattice of adsorption sites is related to the hopping rate @xmath5 by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the length of a single step , and hence @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we thus arrive at the stationary diffusion equation @xmath33 describing the occupation probability @xmath34 of the moving atom in the steady state of impingement , desorption and reaction .",
    "to utilise the azimuthal symmetry of the problem we go to spherical polar coordinates , writing the laplace operator in the form @xmath35 the reaction removing the pair of atoms is accounted for by an absorbing boundary condition at the boundary of the fixed atom , @xmath36      the non - negative solution of ( [ diff ] , [ bc ] ) that is finite at the south pole @xmath37 is found after transforming to the new variable @xmath38 , and is given in terms of legendre functions of the first kind @xmath39 by can become complex , all physical expressions are real . ]",

    "@xmath42 this is the typical distance an atom on an unbounded surface would diffuse prior to desorbing .",
    "the encounter probability for the pair of atoms ( already averaged over all possible starting points ) then consists of two parts .",
    "the first part is given by the fraction of all impinging atoms that reach the target by diffusion , that is the fraction of the impingement flux @xmath6 that enters the target as a diffusion flux : @xmath43 using a well - known identity this yields @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "however , a ( small ) fraction of atoms impinges directly on top of the target area , and these are responsible for an additional contribution to the encounter probability , namely the ( purely geometrical ) ratio @xmath46 of the target versus the total surface area . , we found it must be accounted for in certain situations .",
    "the essential reason for this is that , while @xmath47 is valid in _ all _ regimes of interest , we will also be concerned with the complementary quantity @xmath48 appearing in ( [ anew ] ) .",

    "this can , however , easily be understood : the key effect for the reduction of @xmath2 as compared to @xmath119 is back - diffusion , the revisiting of sites by a randomly walking atom .",

    "[ nonpoisson ] it was shown that the reduction factor of the master equation versus the rate equation recombination rate ( whenever @xmath131 ) exhibits the opposite behaviour ( it is _ only _ relevant for small grains ) , because this reduction is based on a different aspect : the crucial point there was the ` non - poissonianity ' of @xmath0 due to a large encounter probability , and ultimately owed to the confinement of the reactants to a small surface .",

    "[ etas10k ] ) .",
    "we focus here on the comparison of the analytical results for the different sweeping rate expressions .",
    "it should be noted first of all that we do _ not _ include the mechanism of langmuir - hinshelwood ( lh ) rejection .",
    "this mechanism repels h atoms that impinge on occupied adsorption sites on the grain surface and is responsible for a quick decay of the recombination efficiency for very low temperatures , where desorption is heavily suppressed and the h ( and h@xmath161 ) coverage on the grain is large .    as we neglect this effect and treat a fixed grain size ( and therefore a fixed impingement flux ) , the remaining factors governing the recombination efficiency are the relation between the fixed @xmath3 and the temperature - dependent @xmath124 , and the average number of reactants on the grain , which is smaller than , but of the order of @xmath162 . as the temperature increases , @xmath124 increases as well and we approach the regime of large grains ( cf .",
    "[ sweepingratelimits ] ) with the resulting small encounter probability . combined with the decreasing @xmath162 this prohibits efficient recombination . for lower temperatures we head towards the regime of small grains , where an encounter probability near unity and an increasing number of reactants predict a large recombination efficiency .",
    "no finite temperature completely prohibits diffusion ; and due to the larger activation energy , desorption is suppressed even more .",
    "diffusion will almost always let two atoms meet once they are on the surface , and the extremely long time this might take at very low temperatures is a hidden feature when treating steady - state conditions .",
    "lh rejection should be negligible for temperatures roughly at or larger than the peak efficiency temperature @xcite , so we can expect our results to validly show the breakdown for higher temperatures . a rough estimate for a temperature below which our results fail can be obtained using ( [ plotparams ] ) .",
    "the mean coverage of h atoms on the grain is of the order of @xmath138 .",
    "the temperature at which this coverage becomes of the order of unity surely is beyond the validity of our assumptions , and this temperature is given by @xmath163k .",
    ", for a grain of @xmath164 sites .",
    "again , the continuous line shows the master equation result with the true sweeping rate and a square lattice , the dashed line represents the result for a triangular lattice , and the dotted line uses the conventional approximation .",
    "note that this plot is horizontally stretched to uncover the small differences .",
    "the regime of large grains only starts at higher temperatures outside the plotted region.,width=317 ]    , now for a grain of size @xmath165 sites .",
    "this size is ` large ' for practically all shown temperatures.,width=317 ]    for a rather small grain of 1000 adsorption sites ( fig .  [ etatsmalls ] ) , differences in the various predictions of the recombination efficiency are very small , and we increased the resolution by restriction to a very narrow temperature range .",
    "the above estimate suggests that the breakdown of @xmath149 for @xmath166k should also apply to an analogous model incorporating lh rejection . on a larger grain with @xmath167 adsorption sites ( fig .",
    "[ etatlarges ] ) one can see that recombination ceases to be effective at a lower temperature when employing the true sweeping rate rather than the conventional approximation ( differences between the lattice types are still hardly perceptible ) . that this effect only occurs for larger grains",
    "is explicable with the help of fig .",
    "[ etas10k ] , which showed that outside the efficiency peak , the reduction ( of @xmath2 with respect to @xmath119 ) is most pronounced for large grains , since only then back - diffusion becomes effective . on the other hand our earlier explanations imply that ( independent of the fixed grain size ) as we increase or decrease the temperature , the efficiency has to approach the limits zero and unity , respectively .",
    "using the conventional approximation @xmath168 in ( [ penc1 ] ) yields the quantity @xmath169 as a substitute for the encounter probability , which shares the limiting behaviour of @xmath55 used in the argument .",
    "hence in both limits , the efficiency is the same for the two sweeping rate concepts .",
    "a fairly general suggestion of the figures is that grain size hardly seems to matter for the upper bound of the temperature range of effective recombination : a difference of three orders of magnitude of the number of adsorption sites results in only a minute change of the upper temperature bound .    finally , we re - plot the last graph in the arrhenius fashion , i.e.  as @xmath170 , which is shown in fig .  [ lnetatm1 ] . for rising temperature ( in the left part of the plot )",
    "there exists an effective ( negative ) activation energy , which can be read off to be @xmath171k . using the large - grain value @xmath158 together with ( [ alarge ] ) and ( [ examplerates ] ) yields the prediction @xmath172k for this energy , in good accordance with the estimate .        for this astrophysical setting , we may sum up the effect of employing the true sweeping rate ( [ anew ] ) instead of ( [ a ] ) as follows : at a given temperature , relative to the decreased overall efficiency , smaller grains gain in importance for the recombination process , since larger grains are more affected by back - diffusion . with a fixed grain size , the correction is only pronounced for ( absolutely ) large grains , but does not change the upper temperature bound of efficient recombination considerably .",
    "this bound rather seems very sensitive to a more detailed modelling of the complex surface structure @xcite .",
    "our results thus strengthen the claim that hydrogen formation on dust grains crucially depends on the grain surface structure .",
    "we could show that it is possible to rigorously define the true sweeping rate for diffusion - mediated reactions on a dust grain surface , and for a spherical homogeneous grain , it could be evaluated exactly .",
    "the primary effect of the spatial structure of the problem consists in a reduction of the true sweeping rate compared to the conventional approximation , which is due to the back - diffusion of randomly walking atoms .",
    "this reduction is moderate and dependent on the size of the grain for small grains , whereas for increasing grain size it grows stronger before saturating at a value dependent on the ratio of the rates of hopping and desorption of reactants .",
    "the picture of a spherical , homogeneous grain is highly idealized , as is the assumption of a single reaction type , but since the effects we have found have explanations that remain reasonable for any type of grain and with a very general reaction network , we expect the results to remain relevant as well .",
    "applying the model specifically to the recombination of hydrogen atoms on interstellar dust grains , we could compare the recombination efficiency that our model predicts with the results of microscopic monte carlo simulations .",
    "we found that they coincide reasonably well for a square lattice of adsorption sites , but that we can not reproduce , and have no explanation for , the substantially increased efficiency on an ( otherwise equal ) triangular lattice simulations have shown .    in the wake of the decreased true sweeping rate ( compared to the conventional approximation )",
    ", the efficiency is reduced as well .",
    "least affected by this reduction , small grains become more important for the recombination process . for a given size of the grain",
    "however , the upper temperature bound of efficient formation of molecular hydrogen is hardly changed .    for an improved quantitative analysis ,",
    "the complex surface structure of interstellar dust grains seems to be of paramount importance .",
    "it might be a worthwhile enterprise to consider more complicated analytical models which can incorporate some of these aspects .",
    "a possible next step would be the replacement of a single binding energy and diffusion barrier by energy distributions , accounting for the inhomogeneity of the lattice of adsorption sites on the grain , as has been done in simulations @xcite .",
    "another interesting approach focuses on the effect of the porosity of the dust grains @xcite .",
    "we thank e.  herbst for useful discussions and q.  chang for correspondence .",
    "assuming @xmath3 to be large , so that curvature effects do not play any role for the single atomic ` tile ' , we can cover a surface area @xmath173 by simply dividing it into such tiles , each of the area that a single atom occupies .",
    "this tile area depends on the distance of ( the centers of ) nearest neighbor sites , @xmath26 , and the lattice type .",
    "elementary trigonometry shows that , for a hexagonal lattice ( which by common terminology refers to a ` honeycomb ' lattice formed by the adsorption sites , with coordination number 3 ) , it is given by @xmath174 , for a square lattice it is obviously @xmath175 , and a triangular lattice ( i.e.  one with coordination number 6 ) has a tile area of @xmath176 .",
    "so we have @xmath177 with a factor @xmath178 for the hexagonal , @xmath179 for the square , and @xmath180 for the triangular lattice , which is smaller than but of the order of unity in all three cases .",
    "asymptotic expansions of the legendre functions near their singularity are given as equations 3.9.1 ( 13)ff .",
    "in @xcite . since it was not clear from the outset that the degree of these expansions sufficed , we extended the expansion with the aid of computer algebra , and en route found a misprint ( not accounted for in the errata ) in equation ( 15 ) _ ibid .",
    "_ , which erroneously lacks a factor of 2 preceding euler s constant , cf .",
    "( [ num])f .  below .",
    "we rewrite ( [ penc2 ] ) as @xmath181+\\frac{1+z}{2}\\right\\}_{z=-\\cos(r / r)},\\ ] ] and then use to expand the encounter probability to first order in @xmath182 about @xmath183 , keeping @xmath56 fixed . to cast the result into a reasonable form ,",
    "we manually apply various transformations ( valid for arbitrary complex @xmath56 ) to get rid of all @xmath60 and most @xmath74 functions , viz.@xmath184 $ ] , @xmath185 , and @xmath186 .",
    "now we identify @xmath187 , and with the definition @xmath188 [ the square brackets in ( [ p - enc - asy ] ) ] we obtain @xmath189 as the expansion of the encounter probability up to linear order in @xmath190 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the zeroth order term is equivalent to equation ( [ p - enc - asy ] ) and describes a non - trivial behaviour that we examine in the main text .",
    "the remaining question is why the next order is not needed in either of the two regimes discussed in sect .",
    "[ penclimits ] . as in the main text",
    ", we regard the @xmath191 term as being of the order of unity ( cf .",
    "footnote [ lnorder ] ) .    for large grains , there is no need to include terms of @xmath192 : @xmath193 then is of @xmath194 as shown in the main text , while @xmath195 .",
    "the largest contribution of the second term thence has an additional factor of @xmath196 ^ 2\\ll1 $ ] compared to the first summand .",
    "the small grain regime requires a bit more effort , since @xmath56 and @xmath49 can generally be of comparable order now .",
    "expanding about @xmath64 , we have @xmath197 so that @xmath198 . hence @xmath199 and @xmath200 $ ] . the @xmath201 term",
    "thus reads @xmath202 . similarly evaluating the @xmath203 terms",
    "yields the pre - factor @xmath204 $ ] : without a contribution of @xmath205 present , this is but a higher order correction to the first summand .",
    "one can further see that the direct impingement term @xmath49 included in ( [ penc2 ] ) is of precisely that order , and thence must have gone to cancel a corresponding term of the expression ( [ pdiff ] ) .",
    "altogether we have shown that ( [ p - enc - asy ] ) of the main text contains all necessary terms to consistently perform the subsequent approximations .",
