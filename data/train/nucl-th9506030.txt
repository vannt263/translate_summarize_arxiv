    "the pion nucleon form factor @xmath2 plays a very important , but not less controversial role in the framework of @xmath5 and @xmath6 dynamics .    in general ,",
    "meson baryon form factors are used in one boson exchange potentials ( obep ) for the @xmath6 force in order to account for the microscopic , i.e. quark and gluon structure of the mesons and baryons at a given vertex , and therefore provide a natural cutoff description for the interaction potential at short distances .",
    "most of the realistic obep fit the data with a monopole form for the @xmath1 form factor @xmath7 with a large monopole mass @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand almost all other hadronic theories advocate a much softer form factor with @xmath9 : chiral soliton and quark models for the nucleon @xcite , the goldberger - treiman discrepancy between @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite , general considerations on the structure of the @xmath1 vertex @xcite , charge exchange reactions @xcite , threshold @xmath12 production @xcite , deep inelastic lepton nucleon scattering ( sullivan process ) @xcite .",
    "more recent studies within the obep , which either include the @xmath13 resonance @xcite , use a different form of the scalar exchange potential @xcite or consider a correlated @xmath14exchange @xcite also indicate a softer cutoff mass ( @xmath15 ) .    for these reasons it seems highly desirable to perform a calculation of @xmath2 , which does not suffer from the ambiguities of the model and parameterization schemes mentioned above and",
    "is connected to qcd as closely as possible .    in this context",
    "a quenched lattice qcd calculation has recently been carried out rendering a monopole cutoff mass of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "it is the aim of our work to study this phenomenon within the framework of qcd sum rules @xcite , which have turned out to be a very successful method for calculating hadronic properties at intermediate energies ( for reviews c.f.@xcite ) without employing the computer time consuming lattice gauge calculations .    in order to calculate the pion nucleon coupling constant @xmath17 itself ,",
    "i.e. for on shell @xmath12 , one can consider either : ( i ) the vacuum three point correlator of two nucleon and one pseudoscalar meson interpolating fields , which are saturated with resonances in the nucleon @xmath18 and pion @xmath12 channels on the phenomenological side @xcite or ( ii ) the 2 point function of 2 nucleon interpolating fields sandwiched between the vacuum and one @xmath12 state and saturating only with @xmath18 resonances @xcite . with both methods it was possible to obtain rather reasonable results for @xmath19 ,",
    "although it should be stated that the uncertainties in the borel analysis are relatively high , especially in method ( ii ) , even if higher order power and @xmath20 corrections are taken into account @xcite .",
    "if one is interested in the momentum dependence of @xmath2 at intermediate @xmath0 and therefore with off shell @xmath12 , only method ( i ) , which has been successfully used for the calculation of meson formfactors @xcite , can be applied .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we introduce the 3 point function for the @xmath21 vertex and saturate with nucleon intermediate states . in section [ sec3 ] the operator product expansion ( ope )",
    "is carried out . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we perform the borel analysis .",
    "the results are discussed and summarized in section [ sec5 ] .",

    "if @xmath0 is too low ( @xmath104 ) the ope breaks down due to higher order power corrections in @xmath105 . on the other hand",
    "we have used the pcac relation ( [ eq7 ] ) in order to relate @xmath2 to the pseudoscalar nucleon form factor @xmath48 ( eq.([eq8 ] ) ) .",
    "this is equivalent to assume pion pole dominance for @xmath48 , i.e. saturating @xmath106 with a pion state and using the coupling @xmath2 .",
    "this assumption likely breaks down if @xmath0 is of the same magnitude as the first pionic resonance @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath107 , because then @xmath13 contributes in the dispersion relation to a similar extent than @xmath12 does .    keeping this in mind we use for the the borel analysis @xmath0 values in the interval @xmath108 , where our approach can be assumed to be reliable .",
    "hereby we follow the spirit of ref.@xcite and treat the resonance mass @xmath62 as an effective mass , which value is adjusted in order to obtain maximal borel stability .    from figs.([fig3],[fig4],[fig5 ] ) we can deduce that for the whole @xmath0 interval mentioned above an effective resonance mass of @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) gives the largest borel plateau of @xmath111 .",
    "from eqs.([eq26],[eq27 ] ) we obtain the final expression for the form factor @xmath112 defined in eq.([eq1 ] ) : @xmath113 due to the discussion in the last section , we use @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "for @xmath116 we take the experimental value @xmath117 . in order to avoid uncertainties from the sum rule for @xmath42",
    "we will also use the experimental value @xmath118 instead of the value from the sum rule of refs .",
    "the parameter @xmath55 is not experimentally known but has been determined from various analyses using the nucleon sum rule , the most recent and concerning uncertainties obviously most reliable one coming from ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath119 as we have discussed in the last section formula ( [ eq29 ] ) can not be applied for low @xmath0 .",
    "this means that we have to interpolate from @xmath120 to @xmath10 , where @xmath121 .",
    "it is interesting to not that the values for @xmath112 which one obtains by this procedure at low @xmath0 are practically identical to the ones one would get if one applied eq.([eq29 ] ) literally to the low @xmath0 region",
    ". this might be purely accidental , but a possible reason could be that higher power corrections in@xmath105 blowing up the ope at @xmath122 are canceled or suppressed after applying the double borel transform @xmath95 ( [ eq21 ] ) . in order to answer this question",
    "one has to examine higher order power corrections to the ope diagrams in fig.[fig2 ] , which is rather cumbersome for a 3 point function consisting of four quark lines and will be postponed to a separate analysis .",
    "anyhow , from fig.[fig6 ] we can see that the interpolation of @xmath112 from intermediate @xmath0 , where we can apply eq.([eq29 ] ) , to small @xmath0 is very smooth .",
    "furthermore in the whole interval @xmath123 the @xmath112 of our calculation can be fitted very accurately by a monopole form ( [ eq1 ] ) with a cutoff mass of @xmath124 .",
    "this result is very close to the one recently obtained from quenched lattice qcd @xcite , which indicates that both methods give a similar description of the @xmath1 vertex at intermediate @xmath0 .",
