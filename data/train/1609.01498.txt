    "laser desorption ionization ( ldi ) is a powerful technique exploiting electronic excitation to investigate medium- and even large - sized ( bio)molecules as proteins .",
    "the possibility to integrate such ion - source with accurate ion - analyzers such as time of flight ( tof ) , enabled the development of the well known maldi - tof mass spectrometric technique . + due to its high sensitivity , buffers tolerance and very fast scan speed , maldi - tof is today a standard tool in mass spectrometry , in particular in proteins / peptides analysis .",
    "however , its application to a broader range of compounds belonging to different chemical classes is limited by four main issues :    * maldi requires the mixing of the analytes with a proper matrix , generally constituted by organic aromatic acidic compounds , that provides protons able to assist and promote the desorption and ionization(d / i ) processes of analytes .",
    "the choice of the matrix and the optimization of the molar ratio [ matrix]/[analyte ] are still found using empirical approaches . *",
    "the matrix molecules desorb together with the analytes and , being small - sized compounds , they generate strong interfering signals at low m / z ratios , thus hindering the detection and structural characterization of low molecular weight analytes such as those within the range 150 - 500 da . *",
    "the inhomogeneous crystallization of the matrix with the analyte produces a poor shot - to - shot and sample - to - sample signal reproducibility . *",
    "the nature of the ionization process remains poorly understood and no single ionization mechanism is able to explain the complexity of the d / i mechanisms operating in maldi .",
    "a matrix - free ldi has a two - fold advantage : it requires a simpler sample preparation and it permits a wider applicability with respect to maldi , in particular in the low mass region@xcite .",
    "several nanostructured substrates were proposed for matrix - free ldi measurements ranging from metals@xcite , to carbon - based@xcite , to semiconductors and even insulators@xcite .",
    "the appearance of so many different active substrates supports the idea that the d / i is driven by interfacial mechanisms , rather than determined by the physico - chemical nature of the underlying inorganic substrate . + in 1999 wei and coworkers @xcite exploited silicon nanostructures to achieve matrix - free ldi :",
    "the technique was called desorption ionization on porous silicon ( dios ) .",
    "since dios has been proposed for the first time , hundreds of papers tried to understand which parameters optimize the d / i process : some researchers focused on substrates morphology , other on surfaces wettability ( modified by proper functionalization ) but contradictory results appeared in the literature on this topic ( a detailed review of the published data is reported in esi tab .",
    "s1 ) . curiously , some of the articles dealing with dios reported an increase of the efficiency of the porous silicon ( psi ) samples functionalized with a specific fluorosilane ( ( 3-pentafluorophenyl)-propyldimethylchlorosilane ( pfppdcs ) ) , without proposing convincing reason for this effect.@xcite + our results suggest a different interpretation of the experiments and `` minimize '' the importance of the nanostructures for the d / i processes .",
    "in fact we demonstrate that :    * despite the extensive literature , psi is not effective in the d / i process unless hf traces remain in its porous structure ; * psi substrates functionalized with pfppdcs are efficient surfaces for d / i and all the tested molecules are detected at femtomolar concentration ; * different type of pfppdcs - functionalized * * materials ( such as silicon ( si ) and aluminum ( al ) ) are efficient matrix - free substrates and do not require nanostructuring . furthermore the sensitivity achieved with bulk substrates is of the same order of the one reported for dios chips .",
    "points 1 and 2 are strongly related : while naked psi is inert and does not promote d / i , as soon as it is functionalized with pfppdcs , acceptable ionization and good sensitivity are readily achieved with no clear dependence on the psi nanostructure .",
    "furthermore the effect of hf traces remaining within the nanopores is easily checked and further supports the role of fluoride species in d / i , as underlined below . both these resutls are hardly `` justifiable '' by a non - optimized psi nanostructure or by oxidation - related effects . + point 3 is a further demonstration that d / i is neither directly related with the chemistry of the underlying substrate nor it depends on the surface nanostructuring .",
    "rather it is mainly driven by interfacial effects .",
    "+ as analytes we tested different types of molecules : ( des - arg9)-bradykinin and reserpine , since they have been analyzed in several dios studies ; moreover we tested 3 relevant small biomolecules ( abscisic acid ( aba ) , luteolin and quercetin ) .",
    "aba is an important plant hormone , involved in many plant developmental processes .",
    "worth of note it is a regulator of various environmental stress responses @xcite . even quercetin and luteolin are important bioactive compounds with antioxidative and anti - inflammatory properties ; they are the flavonoids more widely distributed in nature , mainly in fruits , vegetables , and teas @xcite .",
    "the detection and quantification of these small - sized metabolites in real biological samples ( plant extracts ) is still an analytical challenge .",
    "this is the main reason that prompted us to choose these molecules to test our methodology .",
    "psi samples were fabricated with the usual electrochemical etching@xcite .",
    "we prepared hundreds of morphologically different psi ( see esi tab .",
    "s2-s4 ) . after the etching",
    ", all samples were thoroughly rinsed in ethanol and dried under nitrogen flow , with the exception of those containing hf traces ; on the latter the analytes were deposited immediately after the etching , without any rinsing .",
    "some psi samples have been used as prepared ( fresh psi ) ; other have been either oxidized or functionalized .",
    "psi chips have been oxidized in different ways : a thin oxide layer spontaneously growth if the samples were let in air for 12 h ; thermal oxide with different thickness have been growth by letting the samples at ambient atmosphere either at 300@xmath0c for 7 h or at 150@xmath0c for 3 h. finally wet oxidation has been achieved by dipping the samples in deionized water for 2h .",
    "+ to silanize the psi substrates with pfppdcs , they were dipped in water for 12 h followed by their drying through a thermal treatment ( 2.5 h , 90 @xmath0c ) .",
    "10 @xmath1 of pfppdcs were deposited on the samples and left on an hot plate at 90 @xmath2 for 2 h. all samples were rinsed with ethanol to remove the excess of the silane - reagent . + silicon , aluminum and indium tin oxide bulk samples ( f - bulk - si , f - bulk - al , f - bulk - ito ) were silanized with pfppdcs : after 2 min air plasma cleaning , 10 @xmath1 of pfppdcs were deposited on each sample and left on an hot plate ( 90 @xmath0c ) for 2 h. all samples were rinsed with ethanol to remove the excess of the silane - reagent .",
    "various analytes were tested : ( des - arg9)-bradykinin ( tocris bioscience ) , reserpine , luteolin , quercitin and abscisic acid ( all from sigma - aldrich ) .",
    "+ to perform the maldi experiments the analytes were mixed with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid ( dhb , sigma - aldrich ; [ analyte]:[matrix ] = 1:5000 ) and methanol ( sigma - aldrich ) to obtain the following concentrations : ( des - arg9)-bradykinin 1 ng/@xmath1 , reserpine 0.6 ng/@xmath1 , luteolin and quercitin 500 ng/@xmath1 , aba 190 ng/@xmath1 .",
    "+ to perform matrix - free ldi , the targeted analytes were dissolved in various solvents ( methanol ; h@xmath3o : methanol 1:1 ; 0.1% aqueous tfa : methanol 1:1 ; aqueous nacl 1.35 mm : methanol 1:1 ) .",
    "ldi measurements were performed at different concentrations ( 1000 ng/@xmath1 , 500 ng/@xmath1 , 250 ng/@xmath1 , 100 ng/@xmath1 , 10 ng/@xmath1 , 1 ng/@xmath1 0.6 ng/@xmath1 and 0.1 ng/@xmath1 ) .",
    "+      we used a maldi - tof instrumentation ( ultraflex iii tof / tof , bruker ; n@xmath3 laser with 3 ns pulse at 337 nm ; maximum energy / pulse : 93 @xmath4 ; repetition rate of 20 hz ) . both the energy per pulse ( set at about 65 @xmath4 ) and the number of laser shots were adjusted during the measurements to find optimal conditions .",
    "the extraction field for cations was -25 kv , whereas for anions was + 20 kv .",
    "the extraction time was kept fixed at 100 ns .",
    "all the analyses were performed in the reflector mode and a suitable external calibration was performed before each series of measurements .",
    "we tested hundreds of psi samples to check their efficiency as matrix - free ldi substrates ( a detailed list is found in esi tab .",
    "s2-s4 ) . despite the large number of different porous morphologies and the different extent of surface oxidation of these substrates , none of the tested analytes was detected neither in positive nor in negative ion - mode .",
    "this outcome suggests that the requirement of a nanostructured surface as ldi substrate is not sufficient to achieve an efficient d / i process of our molecules . as a remarkable finding ,",
    "when psi samples were not thoroughly rinsed with aqueous ethanol to remove hf traces , all analytes were detected with the same femtomole sensitivity reported in state - of - the - art literature ( see esi s3for the details of sensitivity estimation ) . among the various tested compounds",
    ", reserpine has been chosen as a model molecule and its ms acquired using psi+hf chip is shown in fig . [",
    "fig1](a ) .    considering the fact that the analytes are detected as the corresponding [ m+h]@xmath5 protonated species ( except for aba , that was detected as [ m+na]@xmath5 ) , we investigated if the presence of h@xmath5 ions within the pores was sufficient to induce analytes d / i .",
    "after psi samples preparation and before analyte deposition , we added a small amount of weak ( aq . ch@xmath6cooh ) and/or strong ( aq . hcl ) acids , but none of the target analytes were succesfully detected on acidified substrates .",
    "therefore our measurements indicate that hf does not play a major role as a proton transfer chemical species but rather it acts as a source of f@xmath7 anion , with the latter apparently able to assist the analytes d / i .",
    "the fact that fluoride species have an active role in d / i is confirmed by the experiments performed using pfppdcs functionalized surfaces .",
    "@xmath5 peak at m / z 609.6 da ) obtained on different substrates : a ) psi+hf ; b ) f - psi ; c ) f - bulk - si ; d ) f - bulk - al . ]    according to literature@xcite , pfppdcs seems able to increase the efficiency of the psi samples ; in fact when we used florinated psi chips ( f - psi ) all the tested molecules were detected ( an example of the reserpine ms is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) .",
    "+ these results led us to suppose that the fundamental role for the d / i processes is played by the fluorinated silane rather than the presence of nanostructures within the substrate .",
    "thus , our results are in sharp contrast with literature findings where the nanostructures are thought to be crucial for d / i processes@xcite .",
    "to test our hypothesis we functionalized bulk - si substrates : the bulk - si chips functionalized with pfppdcs ( f - bulk - si ) were able to assist the ldi process as much as the f - psi substrates and with comparable femtomoles sensitivity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ) . as for the f - psi cases all the analytes ( except aba )",
    "were detected as the corresponding [ m+h]@xmath5 protonated species .",
    "this finding clearly demonstrates that the nanostructuring is not required for d / i processes once the silicon substrates are functionalized with pfppdcs .",
    "the control experiment , using the naked - bulk - si substrates , confirmed that none of the targeted compounds could be detected .    to investigate if the electronic structure of the underlying substrate plays a fundamental role for molecules d / i , we silanized bulk - aluminum substrates .",
    "also in this case all the analytes have been detected ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) ) , thus the chemical nature of the substrate is not a key element to achieve matrix - free operations and is irrelevant for the d / i mechanisms .",
    "+ on the other hand , the lack of signal from ito samples silanized with pfppdcs suggests that ldi processes are thermally activated ( see esi sec .",
    "s5for a more in depth discussion ) .",
    "in fact ito is a conductive material but does not absorbs the uv laser .",
    "this fact confirms the well known rule that matrix - free ldi substrate should be both conductive material as well as an efficient uv absorbers .",
    "+ among the various tested molecules , the ( ma)ldi - tof measurements on 3 relevant small biomolecules ( aba , luteolin and quercetin ) are also reported .",
    "+ in the typical maldi spectra ( as reported in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a , b ) ) the low m / z region is crowded of peaks arising from the matrix ( in our case dhb ) that complicate the analysis ; instead when using f - bulk - si substrates , the only relevant peaks are those generated from the analytes ( see fig . [ fig3](c , d ) ) .        since psi",
    ", bulk - si and bulk - al chips become all efficient substrates for matrix free maldi once fucntionalized with pfppdcs , an obvious question arises : what is the role of the fluoride species in d / i ? + first of all we excluded that this silane could play any role in uv laser absorption : its molar absorption coefficient at 337 nm was estimated ( see esi fig .",
    "s1 ) to be about 5 l mol@xmath8 cm@xmath8 , thus 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of typical maldi matrices ( the 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid ( dhb ) molar absorption coefficient at 337 nm is @xmath10)@xcite .",
    "+ furthermore , by irradiating a f - bulk - si chip ( without depositing any analyte ) no signal were obtained neither in positive nor negative mode , thus pfppdcs is not ionized directly by laser irradiation .",
    "+ by performing contact angle ( ca ) measurement on a macroscopic area scanned by the laser , we have verified that the silane was still attached to the chip surface after ldi analysis , as the ca remain constant to 82@xmath113@xmath12 ( the ca measured on naked - bulk - si surface was 33@xmath113@xmath12 ) .",
    "+ additionally the root mean square ( rms ) roughness obtained from afm measurements on the area shot by the laser ( 0.7@xmath130.2 nm ) was compatible with that measured on the not - irradiated region ( 0.9@xmath130.2 nm ) .",
    "since a naked - bulk - si substrates shows an rms roughness of 0.3@xmath130.1 nm , we concluded that :    1 .",
    "the silane molecules are not ionized upon laser irradiation ; 2 .",
    "they are not detached as neutral species either .",
    "therefore we excluded any direct interaction between the silane and the laser beam .",
    "we can not exclude photochemical reaction paths when both silane and target molecules were both present on the chip but this hypothesis is hardly justified considering the different chemistry involved when diverse molecules were investigated .",
    "in this article we propose the use of fluorinated surfaces as matrix - free substrates for ldi analysis .",
    "we detect several molecules with good sensitivity , on different target materials .",
    "our findings demonstrate that , despite the extensive bibliography , as etched , naked - psi chips are not efficient substrates for mass spectrometric analyses",
    ". only if hf traces are present within the nanopores the analytes undergo efficient d / i processes .",
    "we added different acids on the naked - psi chips but only the presence of hf traces allowed an efficient detection of all the tested analytes .",
    "this outcome clearly speaks for an active and essential role played by the f@xmath7 anion in the d / i processes .",
    "+ the fact that only hf traces allowed for the analytes detection suggests that the f@xmath7 anion has a role in the analytes d / i .",
    "our finding can not be ascribed to a poorly nanostructured psi because as soon as we functionalized it with the silane we obtained high and reproducible sensitivity .",
    "+ moreover our experiments indicate that the role of the nanostructures has been greatly overestimated so far : not only the f - psi chips , but also silicon and aluminum pfppdcs - bulk substrates can be used for mass spectrometric applications and the sensitivity of the bulk materials is comparable to that of the nanostructured counterparts .",

    "a rough estimation of the detection limits obtained on the different substrates has been performed considering the area of the released drop ( 1 mm in diameter ) and the amount of analyte deposited ( 0.1 ng/@xmath1 ) . by assuming homogeneous analyte dispersion , all the mentioned substrates can be used to detect analytes down to femtomoles level .",

    "+ the main difference between psi and bulk silicon has to do with the energy dissipation by heat conduction , that is very efficient in bulk substrates ( with thermal conductivity of 150 w/(m k ) ) . in psi the efficient energy deposition ( due to high absorption coefficient ) along with a limited dissipation through heat conduction ( thermal conductivity less than 5 w/(m k ) @xcite ) imply that the temperature rises more rapidly and to higher values than at the surface of bulk substrates .",
