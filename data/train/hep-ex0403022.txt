    "figure [ total ] shows a schematic diagram of the flavor tagging method .",
    "the flavor tagging proceeds in two stages : the track stage and the event stage . in the track stage , each pair of oppositely charged tracks is examined to satisfy criteria for the @xmath105-like particle category .",

    "the results from the first stage are combined to obtain the event - level value of @xmath123 .    in the belle detector",
    ", there is a small asymmetry between particle and anti - particle production and detection .",
    "for example , the observed yields and signal - to - noise ratios of @xmath105 and @xmath124 candidates are different due to differences in interactions of the protons and anti - protons in the detector and differences in their yields in the background . in our method ,",
    "@xmath105 and @xmath124 are treated separately and the effect of the small charge asymmetry is automatically taken into account .",
    "the @xmath125 candidates have higher tagging efficiency than @xmath124 candidates due to the larger yields of protons in the background . on the other hand , @xmath104 for @xmath105 s",
    "is lower than @xmath104 for @xmath124 s as the look - up table for @xmath105 s contains larger backgrounds that are generated correctly in the mc simulation . for other tagging categories such as lepton- , kaon- and slow - pion - like tracks , there are also small asymmetries , which are treated in the same way as @xmath125 candidates .    using the mc - determined flavor dilution factor @xmath104 as",
    "a measure of the tagging quality is a straightforward and powerful way of taking into account correlations among various tagging discriminants . using two stages",

    "the combined effective efficiency estimated for kaon and @xmath105 categories is 18% according to mc .",
    "the distribution of @xmath181 contains no entries beyond @xmath182 , as the slow - pion - like track category has much more background than other categories . the effective efficiency for the slow - pion - like track category is estimated to be 6% according to mc .",
    "the peaks around zero in the three distributions are due to pions that have little flavor information .    the probability that we can assign a non - zero value for @xmath104 is 99.6% according to mc ; _ i.e. _ almost all the reconstructed @xmath14 candidates can be used to extract @xmath107 . using a mc sample that is statistically independent of those used to generate the look - up tables , we estimate the effective efficiency to be @xmath183 . since the lepton - like , kaon/@xmath105-like and slow - pion - like particle tagging categories are not exclusive , the effective tagging efficiency is smaller than the sum of the efficiencies for the individual particle categories .",
    "we compare the distribution of @xmath110 obtained from the control data samples with the mc expectation . as shown in figure  [",

    "wrong tag fractions @xmath191 are measured for the six regions .",
    "the average value of @xmath104 for each region ( @xmath192 ) and measured wrong tag fraction ( @xmath191 ) should satisfy @xmath193 , if the mc that is used for constructing the look - up tables simulates generic @xmath2 decays correctly . using the measured ( and therefore average ) @xmath37 value for the region instead of a @xmath37 value calculated for each event from mc , we introduce no systematic bias into the measurement of @xmath107 from the monte carlo simulation , although the effective tagging efficiency degrades . the degradation from the subdivision into @xmath104 bins",
