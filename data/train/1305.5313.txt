    "here is the main question we would like to resolve :    * question 1 : * which manifolds admit metrics with positive @xmath5-curvature ?",
    "it is important to emphasize that the positivity of @xmath5-curvature originally appeared as an ellipticity assumption that ensures that the @xmath22-yamabe equation is elliptic at any solution ; see for instance @xcite .",
    "there are deep and interesting results concerning the @xmath22-yamabe problem , which inspired great interest from the mathematics community in the curvatures associated with the shouten tensor .",
    "our first main result is an affirmative answer to question 1 under certain topological restrictions on @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath28 stand for the @xmath29-th pontryagin class of the manifold @xmath8 .",
    "we recall that a smooth spin manifold @xmath8 is a _ string manifold _ if @xmath30 .",

    "it is well - known that some curvature conditions ( such as positivity of ricci curvature ) impose severe restrictions on the fundamental group of a manifold .",
    "we show that the positivity of @xmath5-curvature does not require any restrictions .",
    "we prove the following :    [ fund - group ] let @xmath9 be a finitely presented group . then for every @xmath42 , there exists a compact @xmath43-manifold m with positive @xmath5-curvature such that @xmath44 .      in section [ sec : positivity ] , we describe close relationships between positivity of the einstein tensor and other curvatures and positivity of the @xmath5-curvature , which provides relevant techniques and ideas to prove the above results . in section [ sec : submersion ] , we examine the @xmath5-curvature on a riemannian submersion . in particular , we show that a geometric @xmath45-bundle carries a metric with positive @xmath5-curvature .",

    "here , we will explain that the ellipticity condition for the @xmath22-yamabe equation is closely related to the positive definiteness of the einstein tensor @xmath48 we notice first that from an algebraic view point , the einstein tensor is the first newton transformation of schouten tensor @xmath0 as follows :    the einstein tensor @xmath49 is the image of the schouten tensor @xmath0 under the first newton transformation : @xmath50    indeed , we have : @xmath51 this proves it .",
    "the next proposition shows that positivity of @xmath5-curvature implies positive definiteness of the einstein tensor :    [ weaker ] let @xmath10 .",

    "then its einstein tensor @xmath49 is positive definite . in particular , if @xmath52 , positive @xmath5-curvature implies positive sectional curvature .",
    "the previous proposition is a special case of a general result , see lemma [ cns1 ] below and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 1.1 ) .",
    "below , we provide a direct proof of proposition [ weaker ] .",
    "in particular , we obtain a lower bound for the einstein tensor . this proof is inspired by the proof of a similar result in dimension @xmath53 in @xcite .",
    "we show that if @xmath54 and @xmath55 , then the einstein tensor is positive definite .",
    "assume that @xmath54 and write @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a trace - free tensor .",
    "then the first newton transformation is given as @xmath58 now let @xmath59 be a unit vector .",
    "then we have : @xmath60 next , since @xmath61 is trace free , a simple lagrange multiplier argument shows that @xmath62 therefore , we obtain @xmath63 thus , @xmath64 .    as a direct consequence of the previous proof",
    ", we have :    let @xmath1 be a riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath10 and positive scalar curvature .",
    "then the first eigenvalue of the einstein tensor is bounded from below by @xmath65 .    on the other hand , positivity of the einstein tensor",
    "does not imply positivity of the @xmath5-curvature . moreover , there are examples of metrics with positive einstein tensor that can not be conformally deformed to a metric with positive @xmath5-curvature .",
    "let @xmath66 , @xmath67 be the standard sphere of curvature @xmath68 , and @xmath69 be a compact space form of curvature @xmath70 .",
    "we define @xmath15 to be the riemannian product of @xmath71 and @xmath72 on @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath74 be as above with @xmath66",
    ". then    1 .",
    "@xmath75 and the einstein tensor @xmath76 is positive definite ; 2 .",
    "there is no metric @xmath77 in the conformal class @xmath78 $ ] with positive @xmath5-curvature .",
    "it is not difficult to check that @xmath75 and the einstein tensor @xmath76 is positive definite .",
    "the metric @xmath15 is conformally flat , and therefore , any metric in the conformal class of @xmath15 is conformally flat as well .",
    "then ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) asserts that the existence of a conformally flat metric with positive @xmath5-curvature on a compact manifold of dimension @xmath79 implies the vanishing of its @xmath43-th betti number .",
    "however , the @xmath43-th betti number of @xmath73 is the same one as for @xmath80 , which can not be equal to zero .",
    "thus we see that positivity of the @xmath5-curvature of a riemannian metric is a rather strong condition since it implies positivity of the einstein tensor in all dimensions at least three . in dimension",
    "@xmath31 , it guarantees positivity of sectional curvature , and in dimension @xmath53 , it implies positivity of ricci curvature .    on the other hand , as we shall show in the sequel to this paper , there are very simple examples , such as the product of spheres @xmath81 , with @xmath82 , which admit a riemannian metric that has non - negative sectional curvature , positive ricci curvature and positive definite einstein tensor , but its @xmath22-curvature is negative .",
    "we address here the following natural question :    * question 2 . * which curvature conditions imply positive @xmath5-curvature ?",
    "clearly , positivity of the schouten tensor implies positivity of @xmath5-curvature , however , this condition is too strong . in fact , positivity of the schouten tensor is equivalent to positivity of all @xmath2-curvatures for @xmath20 . in the next proposition , we give much weaker conditions that imply positivity of @xmath5-curvature :    let @xmath83 be even and @xmath1 be a riemannian @xmath43-manifold such that the sum of the smallest @xmath84 eigenvalues of the schouten tensor is positive .",
    "then the metric @xmath15 has positive @xmath5-curvature .",
    "one can easily prove the previous result using the exterior product of double forms as in @xcite . using the notations of these two references ,",
    "we get @xmath85 the last inner product can be easily seen as a sum whose terms are products of two factors .",
    "one factor is the sum of @xmath86 eigenvalues of @xmath0 and the other factor is the sum of the remaning @xmath86 eigenvalues of @xmath0 .",
    "this shows that @xmath22 is positive . to be more explicit , let @xmath87 be an orthonormal basis that diagonalises @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath88 clearly , @xmath26 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "we recall that the _ second gauss - bonnet curvature _ @xmath89 is defined by @xmath90 the positivity properties of @xmath89 were studied in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath22-curvature coincides ( up to a constant factor ) with @xmath89 for conformally - flat manifolds .",
    "precisely , the @xmath22-curvature is the non - weyl part of @xmath89 as follows :    for an arbitrary riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath91 , we have @xmath92 in particular , positive ( resp .",

    "@xmath94 ) .",
    "even though this paper is mainly about the @xmath5-curvature ( i.e. , scalar and @xmath22-curvature ) , we briefly discuss here the higher @xmath2-curvatures and corresponding @xmath46-curvatures . in this subsection",
    "we shall use the formalism of double forms as in @xcite . recall that the @xmath2-curvature and the newton transformation @xmath95 of a riemannian manifold @xmath1 are given by : @xmath96    here we considered the schouten tensor @xmath0 as a @xmath97-double form .",
    "the following algebraic fact is a classical result , see ( * ? ? ?",

    "we are now going to apply lemma [ cns1 ] to the higher gauss - bonnet curvatures and einstein - lovelock tensors .",
    "first , recall that for @xmath101 , the @xmath102-th gauss - bonnet curvature @xmath103 of @xmath1 is the function defined on @xmath8 by @xmath104 the @xmath102-th einstein - lovelock tensor of @xmath1 , denoted @xmath105 , is defined by @xmath106 if @xmath107 , we set @xmath108 . for @xmath109 , we set @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",

    "it would be great to see theorem [ hoel ] generalized for families of metrics in the spirit of papers @xcite .",
    "this would allow us to understand much more about the topology of the space of metrics satisfying a curvature condition as above .",
