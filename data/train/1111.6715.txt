    "one important issue in fusion research is the understanding and control of turbulent radial flux of particles and heat in magnetized plasmas , in order to improve the confinement properties of fusion devices@xcite .",

    "a long standing question has been @xcite : what is the role of coherent structures in this radial transport ?",
    "the answer to this question requires extracting and characterizing coherent structures .",
    "a particularly appropriate framework to identify coherent structures is the wavelet representation , where wavelets are basis functions well localized in both physical and fourier space @xcite .",
    "it has already been used to identify coherent structures in fluid turbulence and to distinguish them from background incoherent noise @xcite .",
    "these methods have recently been applied to experimental signals of ion density in the tokamak scrape - off layer @xcite , separating coherent bursts from incoherent noise . in the present work",
    "these methods are applied to assess the role of coherent vorticity structures in anomalous radial transport in two - dimensional numerical simulations of drift - wave turbulence .",
    "drift waves are now generally considered to play a key role in the dynamics and transport properties of tokamak edge turbulence ( e.g. [ ] and references therein ) . at the edge ,",
    "the plasma temperature is low and the collision rate relatively large , therefore the resistivity is potentially important .",
    "the hasegawa - wakatani model@xcite is a two - field model which includes the main features of turbulent transport by resistive drift waves . in the present work the two - dimensional slab geometry - version of this model",
    "is chosen as a paradigm for drift - wave turbulence in the plasma - edge region . in dimensionless form",

    "the equilibrium density @xmath8 is non - uniform , with a density gradient @xmath9 in the negative @xmath6-direction , such that the equilibrium density scale @xmath10 is constant and the value of @xmath11 is one .",
    "the plasma density fluctuations @xmath1 are normalized by @xmath8 , therefore @xmath12 , the electrostatic potential is normalized as @xmath13 , the space as @xmath14 and the time as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the electron charge , @xmath17 the electron temperature , @xmath18 the ion cyclotron frequency and @xmath19 is the ion integral lengthscale .",
    "@xmath20 is the strength of the equilibrium magnetic field in the @xmath21-direction and @xmath22 is the ion mass .",
    "the key parameter in this model is the adiabaticity @xmath23 , which represents the strength of the parallel electron resistivity .",
    "it is defined as @xmath24 with @xmath25 the effective parallel wavenumber and @xmath26 the electron resistivity .",
    "the vorticity @xmath27 is related to the electrostatic potential @xmath2 by @xmath28 note that for @xmath29 , equation ( [ hw1 ] ) corresponds to the advection - diffusion of a passive scalar in the presence of a ( unity ) mean scalar gradient in the @xmath6-direction .",
    "equation ( [ hw2 ] ) corresponds in this case to the vorticity equation . for @xmath30",
    "the hasegawa - mima @xcite one field approximation is approached,@xcite which ignores all resistive effects .",
    "for @xmath31 we recover the hydrodynamic limit , which is less relevant to describe edge fusion - plasma . here",
    "two cases will be considered : a quasi - adiabatic case with @xmath32 , and a quasi - hydrodynamic case with @xmath33 .",
    "the case @xmath32 is generally considered to be the most relevant for tokamak - research and has been investigated in several other works ( e.g. [ ] ) .",
    "both cases differ from the fluid - dynamical case in that the velocity field is forced through the interaction term @xmath34 .",
    "the influence of this term on the density field can however be considered to be negligible in the quasi - hydrodynamic case @xcite .",
    "the quantity of interest , the radial particle density flux , is the correlation between the radial velocity @xmath35 and the particle density , @xmath36 where the brackets denote an average over both time and space .",
    "the question we address in this paper is how coherent structures contribute to this flux . to investigate this , direct numerical simulations of the hasegawa - wakatani system",
    "are performed on a periodic domain discretized with @xmath37 gridpoints .",
    "the length of the domain is 64 @xmath38 .",
    "a finite difference method is used in which the nonlinear terms are computed using a method developed by arakawa @xcite .",

    "we select a dipolar structure that we indicate by a white frame .",

    "definitions and details on the orthogonal wavelet transform and its extension to higher dimensions can be found , e.g. , in [ ] . in the following we fix the notation for the orthogonal wavelet decomposition of a two  dimensional scalar valued field .",
    "the wavelet transform unfolds the field into scales , positions and directions using a set of dilated , translated and rotated functions , called wavelets .",
    "each wavelet is well - localized in space , oscillating ( _ _ i.e. _ , _ it has at least a vanishing mean , or better its first @xmath42 moments vanish ) , and smooth ( _ _ i.e. _ , _ its fourier transform exhibits fast decay for wavenumbers tending to infinity ) .",
    "we here apply the coherent vortex extraction ( cve ) algorithm @xcite using orthogonal wavelets . in dimension two ,",
    "orthogonal wavelets span three directions ( horizontal , vertical and diagonal ) , due to the tensor product construction .",
    "to go from one scale to the next , wavelets are dilated by a factor two and the translation step doubles accordingly .",
    "wavelet coefficients are thus represented on a dyadic grid@xcite .",
    "we apply the cve algorithm to the vorticity fields @xmath27 of both the quasi - hydrodynamic and the quasi - adiabatic regime .",
    "the extraction is performed from the vorticity since enstrophy is an inviscid invariant in the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "moreover , vorticity is galilean invariant in contrast to velocity and streamfunction .",
    "we consider the quasi - stationary state of the simulations , i.e. , when a saturated regime is reached , and we decompose the vorticity field , given at resolution @xmath43 , into an orthogonal wavelet series    @xmath44    where the multi",

    "the cve algorithm can be summarized in the following three step procedure :    * _ decomposition : _ compute the wavelet coefficients @xmath61 using the fast wavelet transform@xcite . * _ thresholding : _ apply the thresholding function @xmath62 to the wavelet coefficients @xmath61 , thus discarding the coefficients with absolute values smaller than the threshold @xmath63 . *",
    "_ reconstruction : _ reconstruct the coherent vorticity field @xmath64 from the thresholded wavelet coefficients using the fast inverse wavelet transform .    the incoherent vorticity field",

    "this threshold value allows for optimal denoising in a minmax sense , assuming the noise to be additive , gaussian and white@xcite .    in summary ,",
    "this decomposition yields @xmath70 .",

    "@xmath81 of the modes retain @xmath82 of the energy and @xmath83 of the enstrophy .",
    "the contribution of the coherent vorticity to the radial flux is also given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the coherent modes , which contain most of the energy and enstrophy , are responsible for @xmath84 of the radial particle density flux @xmath77 in the quasi - hydrodynamic case , and for @xmath85 of @xmath77 in the quasi - adiabatic case . in other words , @xmath77 is almost exclusively carried by the coherent structures .",
    "spectra and probability density functions ( pdf ) , averaged over @xmath86 realizations during the time interval @xmath87 , are shown in figure [ pdfvort512 ] for the total , coherent and incoherent vorticity .",
    "the pdf of the total and coherent quasi - hydrodynamic vorticity is far from gaussian and slightly skewed , while the quasi - adiabatic vorticity is much closer to gaussianity . in both cases ,",
    "the variance of the incoherent part is much smaller than the variance of the coherent part , which has the same pdf as the total .",
    "for the quasi - hydrodynamic case , the coherent part retains @xmath80 of the variance of the vorticity fluctuations and therefore also @xmath80 of the total enstrophy @xmath88 , with @xmath89 . for the quasi - adiabatic case , the coherent part retains @xmath83 of the variance of the vorticity fluctuations and hence @xmath90 , with @xmath91 .",
    "a similar result is observed in the enstrophy spectrum computed from the fourier transform of the vorticity field , averaged over wavenumber shells of radius @xmath92 , the wavenumber .",
    "the total and coherent enstrophy are the same all over the inertial range and at the highest wavenumbers , in the dissipation range , the incoherent part contributes to the spectral enstrophy density .",
    "both coherent and incoherent contributions are spread all over the spectral range , but they present different spectral slopes in the inertial range and therefore different spatial correlations . from the integral wavenumber to the dissipation wavenumber , a negative slope for the coherent contribution , corresponding to long range spatial correlations , is observed . the incoherent part shows a positive slope with a power - law dependence close to @xmath93 in the inertial range .",
    "this corresponds to an equipartition of kinetic energy in two dimensions .",
    "a similar result was obtained in three - dimensional isotropic navier - stokes turbulence@xcite .      we show in figure [ scatter ] scatter - plots of the vorticity versus the electrostatic potential corresponding to the fields in figure [ vortfields ] .",
    "both the total part and the incoherent part are shown .",
    "since the coherent part is almost identical to the total part , it has been omitted .",
    "also shown , superposed on the same figures , is the scatter - plot corresponding to the zoom on the dipolar structures indicated by a white frame in figure [ vortfields ] . in the freely decaying hydrodynamic case ,",
    "@xmath29 , joyce and montgomery @xcite showed that a functional relation @xmath94 should be expected , corresponding to a final state of decay depleted from nonlinearity .",
    "the parameters @xmath95 and @xmath96 are lagrangian multipliers , necessary for maximizing the entropy under constraints . the value @xmath97 can be associated with a ( negative ) temperature @xcite .",
    "depletion from nonlinearity corresponds to steady solutions of the euler equation , @xmath98=0 $ ] , implied by the existence of a functional relation @xmath99 .",
    "indeed drift - wave turbulence contains an internal instability which prevents the flow from decaying .",
    "this forcing is present in both cases considered here and a _ sinh - poisson _ relation can not be expected _ a priori _ for the global flows .",
    "moreover , the two - field model [ equations ( [ hw1 ] ) and ( [ hw2 ] ) ] contains two nonlinearities , first the polarization - drift nonlinearity in the vorticity equation , second the @xmath100 nonlinearity in the density equation .",
    "the latter disappears in the adiabatic limit as @xmath1 and @xmath2 are in phase , which corresponds to a linear functional relationship . in figure",
    "[ scatter ] , a local depletion of the polarization - drift nonlinearity is seen for the quasi - hydrodynamic case .",
    "the scatter - plot of @xmath101 , corresponding to the dipolar structure , that is indicated by a white frame in figure [ vortfields ] ( left ) , is close to a _ sinh - poisson _ relation ( solid black curve ) in spite of the presence of the forcing term . in the quasi - adiabatic case",
    "the dipolar structure , that is indicated by a white frame in figure [ vortfields ] ( right ) , does not exhibit such a functional relation . in the incoherent parts ( figure [ scatter ] , bottom ) no functional relation",
    "can be distinguished , which confirms that the incoherent part does not contain any structure , for both quasi - hydrodynamic and quasi - adiabatic cases .",
    "a question is now how to quantitatively distinguish between the structures in both cases .",
    "intuitively it can be inferred that different regions of high vorticity in the quasi - adiabatic case involve strong mutual shearing which strongly limits their lifetime and the chance to reach a functional relation @xmath99 .",
    "koniges @xcite determined the lifetime of individual eddies compared to the eddy - turnover time @xmath102 , i.e. the time it takes for a fluid element in an eddy to make a @xmath103 rotation .",
    "they estimated the lifetime of the quasi - hydrodynamic eddies to be approximately 10 @xmath102 , and the lifetime of the adiabatic eddies ( for @xmath104 ) approximately @xmath102 .",
    "as mentioned in their paper , this measure is quite subjective and very time - consuming , especially if a full pdf of the lifetimes is to be obtained .",
    "here we propose a simpler way to distinguish the coherent structures for the different regimes .    in fluid turbulence",
    "the weiss criterion @xmath105 @xcite is a local measure of the strain compared to the vorticity for a 2d velocity field .",
    "the weiss field is defined as : @xmath106 with @xmath107 @xmath108 and @xmath109 are two orthogonal components of the velocity vector . the weiss criterion was proposed to identify coherent structures , but it may lead to ambiguous results because the underlying assumption that the velocity gradient varies slowly with respect to the vorticity gradient is not generally valid @xcite .",
    "we here apply the same criterion to drift - wave turbulence @xcite but not to identify coherent structures ( this being done by the cve method ) , but to distinguish between the quasi - hydrodynamic and quasi - adiabatic cases .     for the quasi - hydrodynamic and quasi - adiabatic velocity fields .",
    "[ pdfq ] ]    the pdf of the weiss field ( fig.[pdfq ] ) reveals that it is its skewness that differentiates best the two fields .",
    "indeed , it is more skewed towards negative @xmath105 for the quasi - hydrodynamic case than for the quasi - adiabatic case : the skewness is @xmath110 for the former , compared to @xmath111 for the latter .",
    "the pdf shows thus that in the quasi - hydrodynamic case the probability to find rotationally dominated regions is larger , and the rotation exhibits much larger values , than in the quasi - adiabatic case .",
    "the variance of @xmath105 is comparable for the two cases ( @xmath112 and @xmath113 for the quasi - hydrodynamic case and the quasi - adiabatic case , respectively ) .",
    "the skewness of the weiss field @xmath105 appears to be a good quantitative measure to distinguish between the two cases studied in the present work . in further studies",
    "it can be investigated , whether this measure can be used to identify coherence in different types of turbulent flows .",
    "in conclusion , we have applied the _ coherent vortex extraction _ method to dissipative drift - wave turbulence .",
    "the results show that we can identify the essential degrees of freedom ( less than @xmath114 ) responsible for the nonlinear dynamics and transport .",
    "the coherent modes contain almost all the energy and enstrophy and contribute to more than @xmath85 of the radial flux .",
    "evaluating the scatter - plot of the vorticity versus the electrostatic potential , it is shown that the coherent structures in the quasi - hydrodynamic case are close to a state of local depletion of polarization - drift nonlinearity .",
    "in contrast , this is not the case for the quasi - adiabatic regime , where nonlinearity remains active and no _ sinh_-functional relation between vorticity and electrostatic potential is observed .",
    "this depletion of nonlinearity in the quasi - hydrodynamic regime may explain the failure of the quasi - linear estimate of the radial flux@xcite .",
    "the skewness of the weiss field yields a quantitative measure for the difference in nonlinear behavior of the coherent structures between the quasi - hydrodynamic and quasi - adiabatic cases .",
    "the wavelet transforms , or the proper orthogonal decomposition ( pod ) , may become very useful to denoise particle - in - cell simulations of plasma turbulence@xcite .",
    "a comparison of the performance of the pod and cve method is currently undertaken and will be reported in a future paper .",
