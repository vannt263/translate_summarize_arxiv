    "graphs offer a valuable means of encoding relational information between entities of complex systems , arising in modern communications , transportation and social networks , among others . despite the abundance of network analysis techniques ,",
    "information visualization is a powerful tool for capturing patterns that may not be apparent in large - scale systems .",
    "however , most visualization algorithms focus more on aesthetic appeal than the structural characteristics of the underlying data . such network structure is captured through graph - theoretic notions such as node centrality and network cohesion .    the present paper deals with embedding graphs for visualization while adhering to the underlying node centrality structure .",
    "centrality measures capture the relative importance of network nodes among their peers .",
    "betweenness centrality for instance , describes the extent to which information is routed through a specific node by measuring the fraction of all shortest paths traversing this node ; see e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "other measures include closeness , eigenvalue , and degree centrality . to incorporate centrality using any of these metrics , an mds ( so - termed stress  ( * ? ?",
    "3 ) ) criterion is adopted , under radial constraints that place nodes of higher centrality closer to the origin of the graph embedding .",
    "mds seeks a low - dimensional depiction of high - dimensional data in which pairwise euclidean distances between embedding coordinates are close ( in a well - defined sense ) to the dissimilarities between the original data points .",
    "closeness criteria ( a.k.a .",
    "stress costs ) are generally non - convex , and the quest for global optimality is challenging because ordinary descent methods do not have optimality guarantees , and are sensitive to initialization .",

    "8) to minimize the stress cost yielding near - optimal results .",
    "the novel approach exploits the block separability inherent to the proposed model and adapts the coordinate descent algorithm to determine the optimal embedding .",
    "edge crossings are minimized by regularizing the cost with a smoothness promoting term weighted by a tuning parameter .",
    "smoothness encourages nodes that share an edge to lie closer to each other in the embedding . as a result",
    ", the length and hence the number of edge crossings in the network visualization is markedly reduced .",
    "in addition , the regularization term offers the benefit of incorporating the underlying network topology when the dissimilarities considered are not graph - theoretic e.g. , euclidean distances between feature vectors associated with each node .",
    "moreover , numerical tests illustrate that judicious selection of the tuning parameter results in fewer block coordinate descent iterations , which in turn yields a visually appealing embedding .",
    "to place the present work in context , a prior approach iteratively minimizes a weighted stress function with iteration - dependent weights chosen to incorporate radial constraints @xcite .",
    "however , it is limited to graph - theoretic dissimilarities , and offers no convergence guarantees .",
    "a heuristic algorithm for network visualization uses the @xmath0-core decomposition to hierarchically place nodes within `` onion - like '' concentric shells @xcite .",
    "although effective for large - scale networks , it has no optimality associated with it , and is limited to visualization only in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "the proposed approach scales well for large networks under a well - defined optimality criterion with a convergence guarantee .",

    "most visualization schemes assign @xmath6 to the shortest path distance between nodes @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in this work , the euclidean commute - time distance ( ectd ) is adopted because it decreases as the number of shortest paths between node pairs increases @xcite .",
    "this is more reasonable since having multiple shortest paths between node pairs endows them with a higher level of accessibility by e.g. , a random walker on the graph .",

    "lack of convexity is exacerbated in @xmath25 by the non - convex constraint set rendering its solution even more challenging than that of @xmath24 .",
    "however , considering a single embedding vector @xmath13 , and fixing the rest @xmath26 , the constraint set simplifies to @xmath27 , for which an appropriate relaxation can be sought .",
    "key to the algorithm proposed next lies in this inherent decoupling of the centrality constraints .",
    "by exploiting the separable nature of the cost as well as the norm constraints in , block coordinate descent ( bcd ) will be adopted in this section to arrive at a solution approaching the global optimum .",
    "to this end , the centering constraint @xmath28 , typically invoked to fix the inherent translation ambiguity , will be dropped first so that the problem remains decoupled across nodes .",
    "the effect of this relaxation can be compensated for by computing the centroid of the solution of , and subtracting it from each coordinate .",
    "the @xmath29 equality norm constraints are also relaxed to @xmath30 . although the entire constraint set is non - convex , each relaxed constraint is a convex and closed euclidean ball with respect to each node in the network .",
