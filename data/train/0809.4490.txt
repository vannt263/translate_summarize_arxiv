    "the number of applicable models has rapidly proliferated , many of which are capable of describing the variety of phenomena observed .",
    "this is due in large part to the inability of current observations to resolve horizon scales .",
    "unfortunately , the compact nature of black holes makes it very difficult to access the inner - edge of black hole accretion flows .",
    "sagittarius a * ( sgr a * ) , the bright radio point source coincident with the center of the milky way , is presently the best studied known black - hole candidate .",

    "] of @xmath11 @xcite . already , there is strong evidence for the existence of horizon in this source @xcite .",
    "however , in many ways , sgr a * is very different than the supermassive black holes in agn . unlike its active brethren ,",
    "sgr a * is vastly under - luminous , with a luminosity many orders of magnitude smaller than the eddington luminosity . as a result , it is widely expected that sgr a * s accretion flow is quite different from those in agn , though perhaps more indicative of the roughly 90% of supermassive black holes that are not presently in an active phase .    even when strong - gravitational lensing is accounted for ,",
    "the apparent angular size of sgr a * s horizon is only @xmath12 , a factor of two larger than the next largest black hole ( m87 ) and orders of magnitude larger than any other known black hole ( including all stellar - mass black holes ) .",
    "nevertheless , despite its tiny angular size , recent millimeter vlbi experiments have successfully resolved this scale @xcite .",
    "since only three telescopes were involved with these observations , the resulting @xmath13@xmath14 coverage of the measured visibilities is very sparse . as a result",
    "only two simple models of sgr a * s image , a gaussian and an annulus , were fit to the data by @xcite .    however , we have a great deal of additional information about sgr a * , including its spectral and polarization properties",
    ". we may also require physical consistency in any model ( which would likely rule out an annulus , for example ) .",
    "furthermore , we would like to evaluate the ability of , and optimize for this purpose , future millimeter and sub - millimeter vlbi experiments to constrain fundamental properties of the accretion flow in sgr a*. this paper demonstrates the fitting and parameter estimation procedure for a simple radiatively inefficient accretion disk model ( riaf ) .",
    "in particular , we show that even from very sparse baseline coverage it is possible to robustly extract interesting parameters of a generic riaf . a study that considers how future high frequency vlbi observations can extend",
    "this work will be presented elsewhere @xcite .    in the analysis presented here ,",
    "we make full use of all the observations described in @xcite .",
    "these include two days of vlbi observations at 230ghz that targeted sgr a * using an array consisting of the james clerk maxwell telescope ( ) on mauna kea , the arizona radio observatory submillimeter telescope ( ) on mt .",
    "graham in arizona , and one @xmath15 dish of the coordinated array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( ) in california .",
    "robust detections of sgr a * and correlated flux density measuremnets were obtained on the -  and -  baselines .",
    "no detections were found on the -  baseline resulting in upper limits on the correlated flux density .",
    "in addition , contemporaneous total flux density measurements at the same frequency were obtained by using the full  array operating as a stand - alone instrument .",
    "full details of the observations , calibration , and data processing can be found in @xcite .    in section [ sec : riaf ] we present the simple accretion flow model that we employ . sections [ sec : dataanalysis ] and [ sec : results ] discuss the data fitting procedure , including the bayesian method by which we do the parameter estimation , and the generic constraints placed by the current vlbi results .",

    ", we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    ", and the light gray showing @xmath16 . finally , the black line shows the spectrum for the spin and inclination shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ivv ] ]              sgr a * transitions from an inverted , optically thick spectrum to a optically thin spectrum near millimeter wavelengths .",
    "this implies that sgr a * is only becoming optically thin at @xmath17 .",
    "due to relativistic effects this transition does not occur isotropically for orbiting gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , becoming optically thin on the receding side at longer wavelengths than the approaching side of the accretion flows orbit . as a consequence ,",
    "the opacity of the underlying accretion flow is crucial to imaging sgr a * s accretion flow .    despite being diminutive in comparison to the eddington luminosity for a @xmath18 black hole , sgr",
    "a * is still considerably bright , emitting a bolometric luminosity of approximately @xmath19 .",
    "thus , it has been widely accepted that sgr a * must be accretion powered , implying a minimum accretion rate of at least @xmath20 . it is presently unclear how this emission is produced .",
    "this is evidence by the variety of models that have been proposed to explain the emission characteristics of sgr a * ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "models in which the emission arises directly from the accreting material have been subsumed into the general class of riafs , defined by the generally weak coupling between the electrons , which radiate rapidly , and the ions , which efficiently convert gravitational potential energy into heat @xcite .",
    "this coupling may be sufficiently weak to allow accretion flows substantially in excess of the @xmath20 required to explain the observed luminosity with a canonical radiative efficiency .",
    "nevertheless , the detection of polarization from sgr a * above @xmath21 @xcite , and subsequent measurements of the faraday rotation measure @xcite , has implied that the accretion rate near the black hole is significantly less than the bondi rate , requiring the existence large - scale outflows @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the absence of an unambiguous theory , we adopt a simple , self - similar model for the underlying accretion flow which includes substantial mass - loss .    for concreteness , as in @xcite , we follow @xcite , and employ a model in which the accretion flow has a keplerian velocity distribution , a population of thermal electrons with density and temperature @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively , a population of non - thermal electrons @xmath24 and a toroidal magnetic field in approximate ( @xmath25 ) equipartition with the ions ( which produce the majority of the pressure ) , i.e. , @xmath26 in all of these , @xmath27 is the schwarschild radius",
    ", @xmath28 is the cylindrical radius and @xmath29 is the vertical coordinate . inside of the innermost - stable circular orbit ( isco ) we assume the gas is plunging upon ballistic trajectories . in all of these expressions",
    "the radial structure was taken directly from @xcite and the vertical structure was determined by assuming the disk height is comparable to @xmath28 .",
    "given a choice for the coefficients and a radiative transfer model , images may then produced using the fully - relativistic ray - tracing and radiative transfer schemes described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the primary emission mechanism is synchrotron , arising from both the thermal and non - thermal electrons .",
    "we model the emission from the thermal electrons using the emissivity described in @xcite , appropriately altered to account for relativistic effects ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since we perform polarized radiative transfer via the entire complement of stokes parameters , we employ the polarization fraction for thermal synchrotron as derived in @xcite . in doing",
    "so we have implicitly assumed that the emission due to thermal electrons is isotropic , which while generally not the case is unlikely to change our results significantly . for the non - thermal electrons we follow @xcite for a power - law electron distribution , cutting the electron distribution off below a lorentz factor of @xmath30 and corresponding to a spectral index of @xmath31 , both roughly in agreement with the assumptions in @xcite . for both the thermal and non - thermal electrons",
    "the absorption coefficients are be determined directly via kirchoff s law .    as in @xcite , to correct for the fact that @xcite was a newtonian study , the three coefficients ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) were adjusted to fit the average radio , sub - millimeter and near - infrared spectrum of sgr a*. however , our procedure is different from that employed in @xcite in two respects .",
    "firstly , we keep the radial index of the non - thermal electrons fixed for all models . secondly , the fitting is performed systematically for a large number of positions in the inclination  spin parameter space , yielding a tabulated set of coefficient values . for every inclination and black hole spin presented here",
    "this was possible with extraordinary accuracy ( reduce @xmath35 in all cases and @xmath36 for many ) , implying that this model is presently significantly under - constrained by the quiescent spectrum alone ( the yellow squares ) , this is not the case , having been measured coincidentally , and thus these play a much more significant role in constraining the riaf model parameters . ] .",
    "subsequently , we obtained the appropriate model parameters for arbitrary spins and inclinations via a high - order polynomial interpolation .",
    "the range of spectra for the models we employ here is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , together with the radio & sub - millimeter data that was used for the fitting procedure .",
    "the shown spectra deviate from the fitted spectra much more significantly than the scatter in the fitted spectra themselves .",
    "this is due almost entirely to interpolation process , and is most extreme at high - spins , where the coefficient values begin to change rapidly ( and thus have larger interpolation errors ) .",
    "nevertheless , these do not produce substantially different images at @xmath17 from their tabulated counterparts , and it is important to note that the associated error in the underlying riaf model serves only to favor very high spins ( @xmath37 ) , since in these cases it results in a larger accretion - flow photosphere and , as we shall see , the small size of the photosphere of the high - spin models is the primary reason they are excluded .",
    "hence , in reality , such models are more strongly disfavored than shown here .",
    "all of these models are also capable of producing the faraday rotation measures observed , and thus the polarimetric properties of sgr  a*.    at the time that sgr a * was being monitored by @xcite it exhibited an anomalously low @xmath17 flux of @xmath38 , almost @xmath39 below its average value ( shown by the blue triangle in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) . to appropriately account for this we chose a `` minimal '' prescription for changing the model , reducing all densities by a fixed factor ( decreasing the magnetic field such that @xmath40 is fixed ) until the observed",
    "flux was reproduced . in a sense , this models the low flux as a low - mass accretion period .",
    "these lower - density models do have noticeably smaller , though qualitatively similar , images compared to those used in the spectral fits .",
    "an example image is shown in the left - panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ivv ] for a moderate spin and viewing inclination .",
    "as seen in previous efforts to image relativistic accretion flows , the flow appears as a crescent associated with the approaching side of the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the non - negligible optical depth obscures the black hole `` silhouette '' on this side .",
    "the receding side is all but invisible as a consequence of the doppler shift and doppler beaming associated with the relativistic orbital motion in the inner - most portions of the accretion flow .",
    "images for @xmath41 are related by a reflection ( across a line perpendicular to the projected spin axis ) to images with an inclination @xmath42 . however , due to the approximate reflection symmetry of the riaf model images , the constraints arising from spins pointed counter to and along the line of sight are nearly identical . as a result , for clarity we restrict ourselves to the latter range .    using this model",
    "we created a library of ideal - resolution images , each with a flux of @xmath43 , having different spins and viewing inclinations spanning all possible values .",
    "for the best fit models in @xmath44 and @xmath45 as a function of inclination and spin . for reference , white lines on the color - bar show the minimum @xmath46 ( solid ) , minimum @xmath47 ( dashed ) and minimum @xmath48 ( dot - dashed ) .",
    "we were able to find a good fit for nearly all inclinations above @xmath49 .",
    "models with lower inclinations are too large at all @xmath44 to produce the observed flux on the -  baseline .",
    "conversely , models with large inclinations and high spins were over - predict the fluxes on the -  and -  baselines . ]",
    "+          the existence of an interstellar scattering screen between earth and the galactic center has been well known for some time now .",
    "this has been carefully characterized empirically by a number of authors ; we use the recent model from @xcite . in this the observed flux distribution is obtained by convolving the ideal flux with an anisotropic gaussian scattering kernel .",
    "the anisotropic gaussian is defined by the scattering widths along major and minor axes ( both @xmath50 ) and the position angle of the minor axis ( which is independent of @xmath51 ) . from @xcite , the associated full - width , half - max for the major and minor axes are @xmath52 with the major axis oriented @xmath53 east of north . in practice ,",
    "the broadening was done in the @xmath13@xmath14 plane , where it reduces to a multiplicative factor .",
    "+          visibilities are then defined in the normal way : @xmath54 where @xmath55 are the intensities on the image plane , with @xmath56 aligned east - west and @xmath57 north - south .",
    "because changing the position angle , @xmath44 ( vanishing at north and increasing towards the east ) , corresponds simply to a coordinate rotation , the images were originally computed only for a single position angle , namely @xmath58 .",
    "the visibilities associated with the ideal - resolution images were then computed , and subsequently rotated to the desired @xmath44 . in practice , the visibilities were calculated via a fast fourrier transform , which was padded sufficiently to resolve the shortest baseline ( - ) .",
    "we also vary the total flux , or equivalently @xmath59 . for sufficiently different values",
    "a new image must be produced .",
    "however , for small variations around our canonical value of @xmath43 ( within @xmath60 ) simply renormalizing the visibilities produces a good approximation .",
    "finally , the interstellar - scatter broadening was effected by multiplying the visibilities in the @xmath13@xmath14 plane by the fourier - transformed scattering kernel .    since sgr",
    "a * was detected on only two of the three vlbi stations , there was insufficient observational data to determine the individual baseline visibility phases .",
    "thus , henceforth , by visibility ( and @xmath61 ) we shall , more properly , refer to the visibility magnitudes .",
    "these are necessarily a function of position in the @xmath13@xmath14 plane , black hole spin ( @xmath62 ) , spin inclination ( @xmath63 ) , position angle of the projected spin vector ( @xmath44 ) and flux normalization ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "that is , for a particular realization of the riaf model , we have computed @xmath65 .",
    "the ideal and broadened visibilities are shown in the center and right - panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : ivv ] , respectively . in both of these the positions of the observed visibilities",
    "are shown by the white points . as expected ,",
    "associated with the narrow - axis of the image crescent is a correspondingly broad feature in the visibilities . on the maximum scale of interest ( the -  baseline )",
    "the power is not substantially reduced by the interstellar electron scattering .",
    "at the same time , along the long - axis of the image crescent the visibilities drop off rapidly .",
    "thus , we may expect that , at the very least , the vlbi observations will constrain @xmath44 .",
    "this turns out to be correct .",
    "we follow a bayesian scheme to compute the probability that given the measured visibilities , a given set of model parameters ( @xmath62,@xmath63,@xmath44 ) are correct .",
    "this is , of course , predicated upon the assumption that our simplistic riaf model is appropriate for sgr a*. indeed , this is the primary uncertainty in our reported constraints upon @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath44 . while we can address this model dependence somewhat by comparing the results from different black hole masses , at this point we can only hope that our results are characteristic of generic riaf models .",
    "this is not unreasonable given that the primary physics responsible for the structure of our images , the keplerian velocity profile , is a common theme among riaf models .",
    "nevertheless , it remains to be proven .",
    "assuming the observational errors are gaussian , the probability of measuring a visibility @xmath66 _ given _ a particular set of model parameters @xmath67 is @xmath68 ^ 2}{2\\delta v_i^2 } \\right\\ } d v_i \\ , .",

    ", this reduces to the normal definition of @xmath46 , up to an additive constant , and thus comparing models with similar numbers of parameters reduces to the normal @xmath46 minimization . since this latter statistic is commonly used , and its properties generally well known , solely for the purpose of assessing the quality of the fits we define an effective @xmath46 : @xmath77 + \\ln \\left ( \\prod_i 2\\pi \\delta v_i^2 \\right)\\\\ \\nonumber & = & \\displaystyle { \\rm bic } + { \\rm const . }",
    "\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that since only one of the visibility measurements is an upper limit , we may expect that this definition of @xmath46 will behave very similarly to the standard definition in our case .",
    "the reduced effective @xmath46 is shown as a function of spin and inclination in fig .",
    "[ fig : csq ] for the best fit @xmath64 and @xmath44 . for nearly all inclinations above @xmath78 a good fit can be found ( indeed , @xmath79 ! ) .",
    "the exception is at very high spins and high inclinations ( where the disk is edge on ) .    while eq .",
    "( [ eq : pvp ] ) gives the probability that the observed visibilities come from a given model , what we would like to know is somewhat different : the probability of a set of model parameters given the observed visibilities .",
    "that is , we would like the probability density @xmath80 . with an appropriate choice of priors on @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath44 and @xmath64 , we may construct the desired probabilities via bayes theorem .",
    "as such , we now turn to the problem of choosing these priors .",
    "a natural choice for the prior upon @xmath63 and @xmath44 comes from the assumption that sgr a * s spin orientation probability is isotropic , i.e. , we have no other information regarding its direction .",
    "this results in @xmath81 . in the absence of a complete theoretical understanding of the spin evolution of supermassive black holes ,",
    "we choose the prior on @xmath62 to be uniform , i.e. @xmath82 .",
    "finally , we set the prior on @xmath64 to be uniform as well .",
    "since the allowed range of variation in @xmath64 is small , and the prior probability is expected to vary smoothly , this is not a significant oversight . therefore , bayes theorem gives @xmath83    this is necessarily a probability density in a four - dimensional parameter space , and thus is quite difficult to visualize directly .",
    "furthermore , some of these parameters are physically more interesting than others .",
    "therefore , we construct a variety of marginalized probabilities from this for presentation and analysis .",
    "the most general is simply marginalized over @xmath64 : @xmath84 this probability distribution is shown explicitly in fig .",
    "[ fig : slices3d ] .",
    "we construct a pair of two - dimensional marginalized probability densities as well : @xmath85 and @xmath86 these are plotted in fig.s [ fig : marg ] and [ fig : mass ] .",
    "alternatively , we could choose the most likely values of either @xmath64 or @xmath44 . for some of the panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : marg ] , we choose a hybrid probability : marginalized over @xmath44 but the most likely in @xmath64 .",
    "finally , for the purpose of identifying the probability distribution of each parameter separately , we also construct the marginalized one - dimensional probability densities : @xmath87 these are shown in fig [ fig : marg1d ] .",
    "the relative importance of the three different baselines is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : marg ] . to make a direct comparison of the contributions from different baselines possible ,",
    "the top - left , top - right and bottom - left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : marg ] show the probability after setting @xmath64 to the most likely value and marginalizing over @xmath44 ( justified by the fact that the probability distributions in @xmath44 are quite similar , while those in @xmath64 were not ) .",
    "both the -  detections and the -  upper limit exclude the high - spin , high - inclination portion of the parameter space .",
    "this is primarily because high - spin riaf models result in images that are sufficiently compact to substantially over - predict the flux observed on both of these baselines .",
    "due to its considerably longer baseline length , the -  non - detection is more constraining than the multiple -  detections , despite only representing an upper - limit .",
    "as anticipated , most constraining are the visibilities measured on the -  baseline .",
    "this baseline convincingly excludes low inclinations ( face - on disks ) .",
    "this may be easily understood , qualitatively , in terms of the riaf images themselves .",
    "as inclination increases , the riaf image becomes more asymmetric , and increasingly dominated by a thin crescent ( e.g. , left - panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ivv ] ) .",
    "it is generally the direction across the minor - axis of the crescent that has the shortest scale intensity variations , and consequently determines the long - baseline visibilities . below a critical inclination",
    ", the crescent grows sufficiently fat that it is resolved out by the -  baseline .        at large inclinations , the crescent becomes too thin , requiring the -  baseline to be oriented obliquely relative to the spin axis of sgr a*. this restricts the available values of @xmath44 to an increasingly limited range , as may be seen explicitly in the bottom - center panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] .",
    "thus , while it is nearly always possible to obtain a satisfactory fit , the reduced range in position angle makes such a configuration unlikely . hence we find that the long - baseline visibilities strongly constrain the possible values of inclination and spin to a narrow band near @xmath88 and generally favoring moderate @xmath62 .",
    "we note that the appearance of islands of high probability in the top - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : marg ] is almost certainly due to under sampling in @xmath63 near this critical region , and not indicative of a bifurcation in the allowed parameter space .",
    "this behavior is clearly visible in the combined @xmath89 , which closely resembles that from the -  baseline alone . in this case , we have marginalized over @xmath64 as well as @xmath44 ( i.e. , @xmath89 as defined by eq .",
    "[ eq : marg_xi ] ) , though the difference had we chosen the most likely value of @xmath64 is less than 10% everywhere .",
    "the shorter baselines have effectively removed a small high - spin , high - inclination island that persisted in the -  probability distribution alone . additionally , they have further restricted the spin to low - to - moderate levels .",
    "the combined result , however , is to restrict the spin and inclination to a narrow strip .    in a similar fashion",
    ", @xmath90 appears to limit riaf models to a narrow band of orientations . due to the approximate up - down symmetry of the image ( parallel to the projected spin axis ) , the corresponding band has a characteristic `` u '' shape , corresponding to something akin to a taco shell in the @xmath62,@xmath63,@xmath44 parameter space .",
    "( note that we do not plot @xmath44 over the entire @xmath91 range due to the symmetry of the visibilities under reflection . )    in order to ascertain how the present uncertainty in the mass of sgr a * effects our conclusions , we repeated the analysis for black hole masses of @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "since the mass uncertainty is strongly correlated with the distance to sgr a * ( @xmath94 is very well determined by stellar orbits ,",
    "@xcite ) , we altered the distance to the galactic center accordingly .",
    "as a consequence , the roughly 10% change in the mass results in a 4% change in the angular scale of the riaf images . a correspondingly small change was seen in the resulting probability distributions , implying that , apart from the the riaf modeling , the paucity of millimeter - vlbi observations is the dominant obstacle to constraining the black hole spin properties .",
    "altering the angular scale of the images also provides a proxy , albeit a poor one , for considering different sgr a * models , corresponding to different disk scale lengths . @xmath89 and @xmath90 for a black holes of mass @xmath95 and @xmath96",
    "are compared to those determined using the estimated value of @xmath18 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] .",
    "these extreme mass changes correspond to a 30% change in the angular scales of the images , and can make a substantial difference to the resulting probability distributions .",
    "nevertheless , high inclinations and low spins are still generally preferred , though less so for large images .",
    "finally , because sgr a * is an inherently dynamical environment , exhibiting substantial variations in the millimeter flux on @xmath97 time scales , we may not be justified in assuming that the image of sgr a * was stationary during the entire time that observations were made . indeed , searching for variations in the vlbi closure quantities has been suggested as a way to directly probe the existence of hot spots in sgr a * s accretion flow @xcite .",
    "therefore , to check this , we repeated this analysis for the two days over which the observations were performed separately , finding no significant difference .",
    "this implies that either sgr a * was quiescent during this time or that the individual @xmath98 observation windows were sufficiently long to average out this activity .",
    "the anomalously low @xmath17 flux suggests the former interpretation is correct .",
    "it is evident from the previous section that the allowed parameter space is highly non - gaussian . as such",
    ", we must take special care in how we extract values and their attendent uncertainties for the fitting parmeters . in all cases ,",
    "these values will be highly correlated , and the systematic uncertainties due to the choice of a particular riaf model will dominate the errors ( and thus will not be reviewed again in this section ) .    in order to determine @xmath99-@xmath0 and @xmath100-@xmath0 error surfaces , we first define a cumulative probability @xmath101 where @xmath102 are the parameters of the total probability distribution .",
    "that is , @xmath103 is simply the probability associated with the region of the parameter space that has probability density above @xmath104 .",
    "this is necessarily a monotonic function of @xmath104 , which may then be inverted to find @xmath104 as a function of @xmath103 .",
    "we then define the @xmath99-@xmath0 contour to be that associated with the @xmath104 for which @xmath105 .",
    "similarly , we define the @xmath100-@xmath0 contour by @xmath106 . while these satisfy the normal definition of @xmath99-@xmath0 and @xmath100-@xmath0 errors , it is important to remember that in our case the errors are strongly non - gaussian .",

    "the most likely parameter combination is @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "however , as remarked in the previous section , there are acceptable solutions for a wide range of @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath44 .",
    "the primary effect of the vlbi measurements is to restrict these parameters to a band around a two - dimensional surface , resembling a taco shell with its sides around @xmath107 and @xmath108 , the highest probability densities clustered on the former .",
    "generally , we see a preference for low spins and can rule out inclinations below @xmath7 .",
    "more diagnostic for single parameters are the fully marginalized probability distributions shown in fig .",

    "the spin is otherwise weakly constrained .",
    "moreover , it appears to have a small high - spin island , at the @xmath99-@xmath0 level , around @xmath109 .",
    "the presence of this island is limited by the -  non - detection , and therefore can be directly probed via future observations .",
    "in contrast , the inclination is fairly robustly limited .",
    "the most likely inclination is @xmath2 , where the lopsided errors are due to the lopsided nature of the probability distribution .",
    "it is very clear in the center panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : marg1d ] that face - on geometries ( @xmath110 ) are convincingly ruled out .",
    "however , there is a tail extending to higher inclinations . ] .",
    "the distribution of position angles is more complicated than either spin or inclination . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : marg1d ] we see the taco - shell geometry most clearly in terms of the bimodal distribution of likely @xmath44 .",
    "the most probable position angle is @xmath3 .",
    "however , a second solution does exist at @xmath111 , though containing only @xmath112 of the probability ( under the @xmath99-@xmath0 peak ) of the more likely solution .",
    "our limits upon the inclination are in quite good agreement with previous efforts .",
    "@xcite fit a qualitatively different riaf model , primarily neglecting orbital motion , at @xmath113 and @xmath114 . while these favor high inclinations",
    ", the fact that the images are dominated by interstellar scattering prevents a conclusive measurement .",
    "similarly , efforts to fit sgr a * s flares with hydrodynamic instabilities find an inclination of roughly @xmath115 , though the systematic uncertainty associated with their model is unclear . fitting a qualitatively different model to the long - wavelength observations , a hydrodynamic jet , @xcite also favor large inclinations ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "however , it is not obvious how this qualitative agreement should be interpreted , given the very different geometries involved .",
    "unlike the inclination , our position angle estimate disagrees significantly with many previous efforts .",
    "the primary solution is in good agreement with the @xmath113 and @xmath114 fits of riaf models by @xcite , which imply @xmath117 .",
    "while there is considerable uncertainty in their estimates ( like ours ) , we note that their result is not consistent with our second solution at the 1-@xmath0 level .",
    "in contrast , only our second solution is in agreement with analyses of nir polarization observations , assuming a simplistic orbiting hot - spot model , which find @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "this is not particularly surprising given the difficulties in assessing the relationship between the emitted polarization and the underlying plasma geometry . at the 1-@xmath0 level , none of our solutions are consistent with efforts to fit jet models to sgr a * at @xmath114 , which find @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "this is also not unexpected given the considerably different geometries involved . between all of these ( even prior to our estimate ) , nearly all values of @xmath44 have been reported , suggesting that significant improvements in theoretical understanding and additional observations are required before this question can be settled .",
    "finally , note that our estimates imply that the x - ray feature described in @xcite is not associated with a putative jet , but simply another filamentary structure in the vicinity of sgr a*. however , interestingly , our primary position angle estimate ( and that of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is similar to the orientation of the compact , clockwise disk of massive stars orbiting the galactic center @xcite .",
    "this is somewhat surprising given the the large radii ( @xmath120 ) of the stellar disk , though may be natural if the observed stars are the remnants of an active period in sgr a * s recent past .",
    "despite the sparse @xmath13@xmath14 coverage , and the existence of a detection on only one long baseline , we have been able to significantly constrain the possible parameters of an accretion flow onto sgr a*. within the context of a qualitative riaf model that fits the observed spectra of sgr a * , we have have been able to substantially constrain the orientation of sgr a * s spin .",
    "the magnitude of this spin is less well determined , though the black hole can not be maximally rotating .",
    "this result is relatively insensitive to the black hole mass .",
    "we have not ascertained the strength of our constraints dependence upon the particular riaf model , though our estimates are consistent with earlier efforts comparing longer wavelength observations to an alternative riaf model . however , there are two additional reasons to believe that our results will be generic of riaf models .",
    "the first is that the underlying physics that limits the orientation is the doppler beaming and boosting that is dependent primarily upon the keplerian velocity profile of the accretion flow , a feature that is generic among riaf models .",
    "the second is the weak dependence upon large variations in mass , implying that changing the scale lengths of the accretion model does little to alter our results .",
    "thus , we expect the qualitative form of our constraints to be a generic feature of all riaf models for sgr a * , and our quantitative results to be roughly correct . of course , should the emission observed from sgr a * not arise in an accretion flow , our results could be quite different .    as implied by the right - panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ivv ] , additional long - baseline observations are sorely needed to unambiguously determine both the applicability of riafs to sgr a * and constrain their parameters . in a companion paper ,",
    "@xcite we report upon an analysis of the ability of possible millimeter vlbi arrays to do so . given the number of potential radio telescopes that could be added to the current @xmath17 vlbi array @xcite , the prospects for making significant progress in model parameter estimation are excellent .",
    "already it is clear that with the advent of millimeter vlbi we are now entering an era of precision black - hole accretion physics .",
    "consider an observable @xmath57 , with an expected value of @xmath121 and gaussian random errors of amplitude @xmath122 .",
    "then , the probability density of measuring a value @xmath57 is @xmath123 a non - detection , by definition , corresponds to a `` measured '' value of @xmath57 below some threshold @xmath124 .",
    "the probability of such an event is simply @xmath125\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath126 is the standard error - function .",
    "as expected , when @xmath127 , @xmath128 and when @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",
    "this procedure is identical to that employed by @xcite ,  5.2 , and references therein . while in that work",
    "the primary interest was a careful investigation of the ability of bayesian techniques in the context of linear regression , we are faced with a more general fitting problem .",
    "nevertheless , how non - detections , or `` censored data '' , enter into the likelihood is identical , the distinctions arising only later in the analysis ."
