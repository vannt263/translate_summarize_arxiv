    "the transport properties of the cavity depicted in fig .",
    "1 of the main text are governed by the probability measure to impose on the scattering matrix @xmath31 .",
    "it is well established that :    * in the case of _ ideal _ leads , the distribution of @xmath31 is _ uniform _ within the unitary group : in the presence of tri , the statistics of an ensemble of unitary and symmetric @xmath31 matrices is described by the so - called circular orthogonal ensemble ( @xmath88 ) .",

    "the joint distribution @xmath135 is given by @xmath136 where @xmath137 the distribution can be computed generalizing the procedure used in  @xcite for the ideal case .",

    "the heaviside function denotes the part of the plane @xmath142 where the system admits four solutions .",
    "a similar situation occurs in the study of the distribution of the squared norm , making the resulting expression for the non - ideal case highly involved ( see the attached mathematica@xmath54 notebook ) when compared to the case @xmath75 .",
    "the expression   can be used to probe the behavior of the optimal value @xmath148 described in the letter , and in particular the bifurcation effect .",

    "<S> the phenomenon of entanglement between spatially separated particles is probably one of the most baffling predictions of quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> initially , the idea that entangled quantum states could be subject to non - classical correlations was seen as a possible evidence of the incompleteness of quantum theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nowadays , thanks to fascinating experimental developments , the reality of quantum entanglement is no longer disputed . besides its fundamental and intellectually challenging interest , modern research on entanglement mainly focuses on its possible applications to quantum information processing , cryptography and teleportation @xcite . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> it is of paramount interest to discover feasible pathways for the production , manipulation , and detection of quantum entanglement in a variety of physical devices .    among the most promising routes , </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement in solid - state electronic systems @xcite plays a prominent role . as far as the production of entangled electrons </S>",
    "<S> is concerned , several proposals based on interacting @xcite and noninteracting @xcite electron mechanisms are already available . </S>",
    "<S> a very interesting interactionless mechanism was recently proposed by beenakker _ </S>",

    "<S> @xcite where a ballistic quantum dot ( see sketch in fig .  [ figastronave ] ) is used as an orbital entangler for pairs of noninteracting electrons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a quantum dot is basically a mesoscopic electronic billiard connected to the external world by two double - channel leads and brought out of equilibrium by an applied external voltage . assuming that the classical electron dynamics inside the cavity is chaotic , experimental observables such as conductance and shot noise fluctuate from sample to sample and their statistics ( about which nearly everything is known @xcite ) is governed by the transmission eigenvalues of the cavity .    in order to quantify the degree of entanglement produced inside the cavity , one uses a standard measure @xmath0 called _ concurrence _ , which is related to the violation of a bell inequality for current correlators . </S>",
    "<S> the average and variance of the concurrence for a chaotic dot _ with ideal leads _ </S>",
    "<S> ( i.e. when the tunnelling probability across the leads is unity ) was computed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that these two moments are practically unaffected by the breaking of time - reversal invariance ( tri ) , but the fluctuations can be very large ( of the same order as the average ) . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that a statistical description of entanglement production based on just the first moments is highly inaccurate . the full distribution of the concurrence ( again in the case of ideal leads ) </S>",
    "<S> was computed by gopar and frustaglia @xcite , and indeed they found remarkable differences in the distributions between the cases with preserved @xmath6 and broken @xmath7 tri ( here @xmath8 denotes the dyson index of the cavity ) , although the first moments are only very mildly affected . still in the domain of ideal cavities , geometrical constraints on the entanglement production </S>",
    "<S> were discovered in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit calculation of the joint distribution of concurrence and the squared norm @xmath1 of the entangled state yields the relation @xmath9 , which implies that more entangled states are less likely to be detected as they are bound to have a smaller norm . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion holds irrespective of whether the leads are ideal or not . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the case of non - ideal leads considered here , the above inequality brings intriguing consequences that will be discussed below .    </S>",
    "<S> we remark at this stage that all available analytical results to date heavily rely on the assumption that all leads are ideal . </S>",
    "<S> this restriction is however hardly tolerable , as ideal transparencies are never realized in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling probabilities ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) between the leads and the cavity can be tuned , and it is therefore of great interest to study the entanglement production as a function of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> besides the experimental relevance @xcite , this investigation is fascinating from a purely theoretical point of view since numerical simulations suggest that uneven contact transparencies may confer advantages in the production of entangled states @xcite ( see also @xcite for a numerical study of the distribution of charge cumulants in non - ideal cases ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this letter is to compute analytically the joint distribution @xmath12 of concurrence and squared norm of the entangled state for @xmath13 ( broken tri ) in cavities supporting one ideal and one non - ideal lead characterized by the _ opacity _ @xmath14 $ ] ( related to the tunneling probability via @xmath15 ) . </S>",
    "<S> all the known results in the ideal setting are easily recovered as a limiting @xmath16 case of our theory , whose predictions might be possibly tested within current experimental capabilities . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the non - ideality of the opaque lead is responsible for a rich and interesting behavior of the entanglement production process , which can be optimized by carefully tuning @xmath17 on a critical value @xmath18 that we explicitly compute . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to a nontrivial interplay between an _ increase _ in the average concurrence and a simultaneous _ decrease _ in the average squared norm of the entangled state as the opacity @xmath17 is pulled away from ideality . </S>",
    "<S> this calculation is made possible thanks to a recent breakthrough by vidal and kanzieper @xcite , who were able to compute the joint distribution of transmission eigenvalues for the case of a @xmath13 cavity with @xmath19 non - ideal channels in the left lead and @xmath20 ideal channels in the right lead ( see @xcite for details ) . before summarizing our results , </S>",
    "<S> let us first describe in detail the experimental setting and the relevant theoretical framework .    </S>",
    "<S> the orbital entangler we consider , first proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figastronave ] . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of a quantum dot with two attached double - channel leads at the left and right . </S>",
    "<S> each lead is connected to an electron reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> applying a small voltage between the two reservoirs gives rise to a electronic current flowing through the dot from left to right . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering within the dot leads to the production of entangled pairs between transmitted ( to the right ) and reflected ( to the left ) electrons . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , the outgoing state @xmath21 of two scattered electrons can be written as the superposition @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are separable states , corresponding to both electrons being scattered to the left or to the right , while @xmath25 ( representing a state where one electron is scattered to the left and the other to the right ) may be nonseparable . </S>",
    "<S> since an electron leaving the quantum dot to the left side can choose between channels @xmath26 and @xmath27 for escaping , this defines a two - level quantum system or _ </S>",
    "<S> qubit_. the same happens with an electron escaping to the right side through leads @xmath28 and @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the state @xmath25 in general describes ( up to a normalization factor ) a two - qubit entangled state .    </S>",
    "<S> a widely used measure for quantifying two - qubit entanglement is the concurrence @xmath0 @xcite , an entanglement monotone constructed from the two - qubit density matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the concurrence is intimately connected to the transport properties of the cavity , and the crucial question is then how to compute it in the proposed setting .    consider the @xmath30 scattering matrix @xmath31 of the cavity , @xmath32\\ ; , \\label{s}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are @xmath35 reflection and transmission matrices , respectively . in the presence of tri </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath31 is unitary and symmetric . if tri is broken ( due to , e.g. , the application of a magnetic flux ) , then @xmath31 is only unitary . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath36 and @xmath37 be the eigenvalues ( @xmath38 ) of the hermitian matrix @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the concurrence @xmath0 can be written in terms of the transmission eigenvalues @xmath36 and @xmath37 as @xcite @xmath40 we note that the concurrence varies from 0 to 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the case @xmath41 corresponds to separable nonentangled states , while maximally entangled ( bell ) states correspond to @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> those states with a @xmath43 are non - separable partly entangled states . from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ concu_t1t2 ] ) , the entanglement is maximal ( @xmath42 ) when @xmath44 , and minimal ( @xmath45 ) when @xmath46 and @xmath47 or @xmath48 and @xmath49 . a finite value of @xmath0 guarantees that the left and right outgoing channels are orbitally entangled . </S>",
    "<S> the denominator of is the squared norm @xmath50    the chaotic scattering in the cavity implies that the entanglement production is basically a stochastic process , governed by a random scattering matrix @xcite . in particular , the concurrence as well as the squared norm are random variables whose statistics is the central object of this letter . from @xcite </S>",
    "<S> we deduce after lengthy algebra @xcite that the joint distribution of the two transmission eigenvalues in our setting is given by @xmath51 where the matrix @xmath52 is reported in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the joint distribution of concurrence and squared norm is then given by @xmath53 where the average is taken with respect to the measure . </S>",
    "<S> the final result is explicit but cumbersome and is confined to the attached mathematica@xmath54 notebook @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is more instructive to analyze a few consequences of this calculation . </S>",
    "<S> first , the marginal distribution of concurrence alone , obtained by integrating @xmath1 out in has the surprisingly simple structure @xmath55 where the coefficients @xmath56 , expressed only in terms of elementary functions , are listed explicitly in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the limit @xmath57 , corresponding to ideal cavities , yields @xmath58 recovering the probability of concurrence computed in @xcite , eq . </S>",

    "<S> this is our first main result , which is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figprob ] and analytically corroborates the numerical simulations presented in @xcite .    . </S>",
    "<S> [ figprob ] ]    let us note that the simple polynomial structure of , not evident in , is essentially due to some symmetry of the integrand . in order to clarify this point , it is instructive to consider the general @xmath2-expansion of @xmath59 then , clearly @xmath60 corresponds to the ideal case @xcite , while @xmath61 is antisymmetric under the transformation @xmath62 and @xmath63 , while the concurrence is symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> this symmetry explains why all moments of @xmath0 vanish up to the second order in @xmath17 and the first correction in is @xmath64 . on the contrary </S>",
    "<S> , no trivial symmetry kills all higher order terms and this enormous simplification can be explained only by a non - linear change of variables  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> from , the average concurrence reads @xmath65 with coefficients @xmath66 listed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> being an increasing function of @xmath17 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figaverage ] ) , eq . leads to the somehow paradoxical conclusion that the average entanglement production is maximal for the completely `` opaque '' case @xmath67 where no electrons travel across the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> this apparent paradox is resolved when one computes the average square norm of the entangled state from    @xmath68    which is instead a ( non - polynomial ) _ decreasing _ function of @xmath17 ( see inset in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figaverage ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simultaneous _ increase _ in the average entanglement of the two - qubit state and _ decrease _ in the average likelihood to detect it is the statistical analogue of the geometrical inequality @xmath9 , first discovered for ideal leads @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , having now a tunable parameter ( the opacity @xmath17 ) at our disposal it is natural to ask whether the two competing effects above may be used to optimize the entanglement production process . </S>",
    "<S> we answer in the affirmative , considering the following natural observable @xmath69 namely the _ constrained _ average concurrence under the requirement of a minimal detectable norm @xmath3 .     as a function of @xmath17 ( straight lines ) together with numerical simulations ( black circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> inset : comparison between the average square norm @xmath70 and numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> [ figaverage ] ]    the quantity has a rich and intriguing behavior as a function of @xmath17 . in particular , it develops a maximum for a nonzero value @xmath71 as long as @xmath72 is below a critical value @xmath5 , indicating that for a given value of the minimal detectable norm the average entanglement production can be maximized by finely tuning the opacity of the non - ideal lead . </S>",
    "<S> however , if a `` too high '' experimental resolution is required , the optimal option is to stick to the ideal case . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is summarized in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : optimal ] and arises as a consequence of an interesting bifurcation effect : the value @xmath73 indeed marks the transition from a local minimum to a global maximum of the function @xmath74 around @xmath75 as it can be derived from a local stability analysis  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this prediction constitutes the second main result of our work .    in order to check the analytical predictions , we use the same simple numerical algorithm described in detail in ref . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath30 scattering matrix of the non - ideal system @xmath31 can be decomposed as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a random matrix distributed uniformly within the unitary group and represents the scattering matrix of an ideal cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the matrices @xmath78 and @xmath79 include information on the transparency of the contacts , as follows : @xmath80    we generate @xmath81 matrices @xmath82 using the qr - based algorithm described in @xcite , and we build the corresponding matrices @xmath31 . having extracted the submatrix @xmath83 and diagonalized @xmath84 , we collect its eigenvalues @xmath85 and @xmath37 and from them we construct the concurrence @xmath0 and the squared norm @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical simulations are all in perfect agreement with our theoretical results .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated analytically the distributions of concurrence and squared norm for the entanglement production in a chaotic quantum dot supporting one ideal and one non - ideal lead . </S>",
    "<S> the concurrence distribution is in perfect agreement with the numerical findings in @xcite ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 6 bottom ) and recovers , in the proper limit , the known results on the ideal transparency case  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> geometrical constraints on the entanglement production are responsible for competing effects in the behavior of the average values @xmath86 and @xmath70 as a function of the opacity @xmath17 , which can be exploited to maximize the _ constrained _ average concurrence when a minimal detectable norm @xmath3 is required . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we confirm that the entanglement production is enhanced when the transparency of one of the contacts is not ideal , but only up to a critical value @xmath5 beyond which no net improvement with respect to the ideal case can be exploited .    </S>",
    "<S> this study lays the groundwork for future research directions . </S>",
    "<S> given that the structure of the probability distribution of concurrence as a function of the opacity is simple and elegant , this clearly hints towards a deeper connection with physical symmetries of the system . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we showed that a bifurcation phenomenon arises when the optimal entanglement production is studied in a non - ideal setting . </S>",
    "<S> these theoretical predictions may be tested experimentally and the comprehension of their generality when , for instance , both leads are non - ideal , or in other multi - channel experiments , is still lacking and represents a challenging issue whose solution is much called for .    _ </S>",
