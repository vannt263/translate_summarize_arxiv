    "these precipitates transform into the 9r structure .",
    "shape change , however , is suppressed since it once again would require diffusion .",

    "[ fig : viz_prec](b ) reveals that multiply - twinned 9r cu precipitates have a bcc cu shell that typically comprises about two to three atomic layers and serves as a wetting layer between the close - packed cu core and the bcc fe matrix .",
    "there is thus no direct 9r cu and bcc fe interface , which is of uttermost importance for the thermodynamics of the transition as discussed in detail above .",
    "the existence of a wetting layer has some additional implications including the following : ( _ i _ ) experimentally , the diameter of cu precipitates is typically measured using contrast produced by different lattice structures . as this probe is insensitive to the bcc cu shell it leads to a slight underestimation of precipitate size .",
    "( _ ii _ ) a dislocation interacting with a 9r cu precipitate will not see a sharp bcc fe|9r cu interface but instead pass pass through three distinct zones ( bcc fe , bcc cu , and 9r cu ) .      in sect .",

    "cu alloys , and that for a given precipitate structure and orientation , hardening follows a dbh - type law . for that particular structure / orientation combination ,",
    "the screw direction is a principal axis of the precipitate and there is no kinematic constraint to the dislocation traversing the obstacle ; only the energetics of generating a dislocation segment in a different crystal structure are responsible for the observed hardening . since we have obtained the hardening response from five precipitate sizes , including three different orientations , it is more informative to represent the values given in tab .

    "<S> precipitate hardening is commonly used in materials science to control strength by acting on the number density , size distribution , and shape of solute precipitates in the hardened matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the fe  cu system has attracted much attention over the last several decades due to its technological importance as a model alloy for cu steels . in spite of these efforts several aspects of its phase diagram remain unexplained . here </S>",
    "<S> we use atomistic simulations to characterize the polymorphic phase diagram of cu precipitates in body - centered cubic ( bcc ) fe and establish a consistent link between their thermodynamic and mechanical properties in terms of thermal stability , shape , and strength . </S>",
    "<S> the size at which cu precipitates transform from bcc to a close - packed 9r structure is found to be strongly temperature dependent , ranging from approximately 4 nm in diameter ( @xmath0 ) at 200k to about 8 nm ( @xmath1 ) at 700k . </S>",

    "<S> the strong temperature dependence originates from the entropic stabilization of bcc cu , which is mechanically unstable as a bulk phase . </S>",
    "<S> while at high temperatures the transition exhibits first - order characteristics , the hysteresis , and thus the nucleation barrier , vanish at temperatures below approximately 300k . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is explained in terms of the mutual cancellation of the energy differences between core and shell ( wetting layer ) regions of bcc and 9r nanoprecipitates , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed mechanism is not specific for the fe  cu system but could generally be observed in immiscible systems , whenever the minority component is unstable in the lattice structure of the host matrix . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we also study the interaction of precipitates with screw dislocations as a function of both structure and orientation . </S>",
    "<S> the results provide a coherent picture of precipitate strength that unifies previous calculations and experimental observations . </S>"
