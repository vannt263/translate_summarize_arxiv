    "the outcome of these models covers a large area in the mass / width plane , ranging for the mass from the free @xmath0 pole at @xmath4 mev down to roughly 640 mev for an @xmath0 meson at rest in nuclear matter at saturation density @xmath5 . for the width , that amounts to @xmath6 mev in vacuum , in - medium values of up to about 70 mev at @xmath5",
    "have been obtained .",
    "the origin of the @xmath0 medium modifications at finite density and zero temperature have for instance been attributed to the collective excitation of resonance - hole loops @xcite that lead to additional structures in the spectral function .",
    "another source of medium modifications can be the renormalization of the pion cloud , considered in @xcite , that results in a rather drastic shift of spectral strength to the low mass region .",

    "the loss of flux is obviously related to the absorptive part of the @xmath0 nucleus potential and thus to the @xmath0 width in the nuclear medium .",
    "moreover , the total nuclear production cross section and the transparency ratio can also be sensitive to the real part of the @xmath0 nucleus potential .",
    "an attractive mass shift , e.  g. of the brown - rho - type @xcite @xmath37~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 mev is the physical @xmath0 mass in vacuum , causes an in - medium lowering of the @xmath1 threshold due to the smaller @xmath0 mass at finite density .",

    "we will discuss this issue in more detail among the results of our calculations .      in order to first explore the imaginary part of the @xmath0 nucleus potential , we perform calculations at the fixed photon beam energy of @xmath39 gev . on one hand",

    "( [ gcoll ] ) as a medium modification only . in the experimental analysis one tries to get rid of pions that rescattered in the medium since these @xmath7 pairs essentially lose all information about their source .",
    "this can be done easily as these @xmath7 pairs appear at much lower values of the invariant mass and also the @xmath17 kinetic energy is smaller as compared to pions from the @xmath0 decay that leave the target nucleus untouched @xcite . removing the pions that interacted via quasi elastic collisions from the total flux ,",
    "we obtain the dashed line in fig .",

    "such a modification of the in - medium @xmath2 spectrum has also an impact on the @xmath0 self energy as the most important decay channel of the @xmath0 in vacuum is @xmath48 that is dominated by the gell - mann - sharp - wagner ( gsw ) process , a process where the @xmath0 first converts into an intermediate @xmath49 state followed by the decay of the virtual @xmath2 into two pions . the @xmath50 decay width",

    "going to the nuclear medium , the @xmath2 spectral distribution is broadened due to elastic and inelastic @xmath9 collisions that lead to a shorter lifetime of the interacting @xmath2 state .",
    "we include this broadening by adding the phenomenological collisional width of roughly 100 mev at normal nuclear matter density @xcite to the total @xmath2 width in the medium : @xmath63 on top of that we also consider a dropping @xmath2 mass analogous to the dropping @xmath0 mass in matter given by eq .",

    "we note that not only a shift of the @xmath2 pole mass but also a very general reshuffling of spectral strength to the low energy part of the @xmath2 spectral function would result in a similar effect on the @xmath0 decay width .",

    "our result at normal nuclear matter density excluding the @xmath0 collisional width is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig_ratio2 ] we show the nuclear transparency with and without including the modified @xmath64 decay width on top of the @xmath0 collisional width .",

    "after all , the transparency ratio without any restrictions on angles and momentum of the produced particles will be sensitive primarily to the absorptive part of the @xmath1 interaction as quasi elastic scattering processes do not lead to a loss of flux .",

    "the stopping of the @xmath0 mesons in nuclear matter due to elastic @xmath1 scattering is particularly large as the mass of the @xmath0 is comparable to the nucleon mass , what leads to a relatively high energy loss of the @xmath0 in these collisions .",

    "[ fig_kinetic ] we also show the kinetic energy spectra resulting from these calculations , here for the case of the target .",
    "the peak at high kinetic energies is due to the forward peaked angular distribution for the @xmath82 process .",
    "turning on elastic @xmath1 scattering , @xmath0 mesons from the high energy part of the spectrum are shuffled to the low energy tail .",
    "on one hand , these @xmath0 mesons stay in the medium for a longer time where they have the chance to get absorbed in inelastic @xmath1 collisions . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath1 absorption cross sections are particularly large at low energies due to the open phase space at the @xmath1 threshold for processes like @xmath83 , @xmath84 etc .",
    "hence , we observe a slight reduction of the nuclear transparency with the increasing elastic @xmath1 cross section .",
    "note , that the effect on the transparency ratio becomes significant only for @xmath65-factors @xmath85 what means a rather drastic change of the elastic scattering cross section as compared to our standard estimate eq .",
    "( [ sel ] ) .",
    "pairs from at @xmath39 gev . ]      at first glance it appears to be quite astonishing that the enhanced collisional width has a much larger impact on the transparency than a modification of the @xmath64 decay channel .",
    "the reason for this effect lies in the momentum dependence of both contributions to the in - medium self energy . in our model",
    "the @xmath0 collisional width is  except for the threshold region where the nucleon momentum distribution plays an important role ",
    "proportional to the @xmath0 momentum with respect to the nuclear medium .",
    "thus the collisional width of roughly 37 mev at normal nuclear matter density for @xmath0 mesons at rest blows up to almost 150 mev for a typical laboratory momentum of 1 gev .",
    "in contrast , the modification of the @xmath49 decay width generated by the purely density - dependent @xmath2 meson potential is independent of the @xmath0 momentum . in the considered photon energy regime",
    ", the @xmath0 momentum distribution is peaked around @xmath86 gev .",
    "hence , a doubling of the inelastic collisional self energy ( @xmath87 ) has an effect on the @xmath0 attenuation that is roughly one order of magnitude larger than the impact of the decreasing @xmath2 meson mass .",
    "in fact , the nuclear transparency is sensitive not only to the @xmath1 interaction in nuclei but also to medium modifications of the production processes and decay widths of the @xmath0 meson . in particular ,",
    "also the @xmath0 production rates from neutrons have to be known in order to obtain precise information on the @xmath0 nucleus potential . in view of that , it might be desirable to normalize the nuclear transparency ratio not to the proton cross section but to the @xmath0 yield obtained from deuterium or carbon targets .",
    "further uncertainties concerning the determination of the real as well as the imaginary part of the @xmath0 nucleus potential arise from the possibility that also the @xmath7 decay width as well as other decay channels might become modified in a surrounding with non - zero nuclear density",
    ". in particular the change of the @xmath2 spectral function in nuclei and its back coupling on the @xmath0 in - medium self energy are still open issues .",
    "experimentally , it is essential to understand the background so that the actual production cross section ( that is not necessarily required for a verification of a shape change of the @xmath0 in - medium spectral function ) and , correspondingly , the transparency are quantitatively reliable .",
    "in this section we will finally discuss @xmath0 photoproduction in the semi - analytic glauber picture as a much simpler means to extract the inelastic @xmath1 cross section from the total photoproduction cross section . after our detailed study of various nuclear effects within the coupled channel transport approach , we have found that the nuclear transparency ratio at photon energies well above threshold is first of all sensitive to the @xmath1 absorption cross section whereas other medium effects such as dropping vector meson masses and the modified decay width give rise to only small corrections .",
    "we note , however , that this statement holds only as long as total inclusive observables without any cuts on angle and momentum of the observed vector mesons are considered .",
    "a limited experimental acceptance possibly introduces dependences on elastic scattering processes and details of the dynamics that can not be included in the semi - analytic glauber framework .      in the glauber - eikonal approximation , neglecting fermi motion , pauli blocking , coupled - channel effects , nuclear shadowing and quasi elastic scattering processes , the incoherent single meson photoproduction cross section has the following form @xcite : @xmath88 ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the nuclear density distribution , @xmath90 the total vector meson photoproduction cross section on a single nucleon and @xmath91 ( @xmath92 in the following ) the vector meson nucleon absorption cross section . in eq .",

    "we now fit these expressions , using the inelastic vector meson nucleon cross section @xmath31 as an open parameter , to our buu calculations shown in fig .",

    "we include only nuclei starting from since our starting point , i.  e. the glauber expression for the nuclear photoproduction cross section eq .",
    "( [ glaub1 ] ) , is valid only for large nuclei with a relative error of the order of @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "the results of this procedure are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_fit ] . adopting the lowest order expression ( [ gllow ] )",
    "we find an inelastic @xmath1 cross section of 23 mb , whereas including the correction factor in the curled brackets in eq .",
    "( [ glaub2 ] ) an inelastic cross section of 20 mb is found .",
    "hence , the correction terms are only of minor importance .",
    "this is particularly true for large nuclei as the additional terms come with powers of @xmath110 which is a small parameter for heavy nuclei and large absorption cross sections .",
    "as said earlier , the momentum distribution of the @xmath0 mesons in the data sample is peaked around @xmath111  gev .",
    "hence , the inelastic @xmath1 cross section in our transport calculations with @xmath112 amounts to roughly 24 mb , see eq .",
    "( [ sinel ] ) .",
    "this is in astonishing agreement with the much simpler glauber result .",
    "the somewhat smaller values extracted by means of the analytic formula ( [ glaub2 ] ) can be attributed to the disregard of any target surface region where the mean free path of the vector mesons again becomes large , giving rise to a diminishing absorption probability for any produced particle on its way out of the nucleus .",
    "we conclude that the glauber model provides a quite reliable tool to extract the @xmath1 inelastic cross section .",
    "actual experiments , however , often have geometrical and kinematical acceptance limitations which then require the full transport calculation as we have shown for the case of @xmath10 photoproduction in @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have shown that a measurement of the nuclear transparency ratio can indeed yield important information on the real and imaginary part of the @xmath0 nucleus potential . to this end",
    "we have included all nuclear effects in a coupled - channel transport calculation that describes the incoherent contribution to photon - nucleus reactions .",
    "the imaginary part of the @xmath0 in - medium self energy can be extracted from the @xmath11-dependence of the nuclear transparency ratio by fitting the total inelastic @xmath1 cross section to experimental data .",
    "for such a measurement we consider a photon beam energy of around 1.5 gev as optimal .",
    "studying total inclusive observables only , the inelastic vector meson nucleon cross section can also be extracted from the naive glauber multiple scattering result with a relative error on the @xmath113 level .",
    "also the real part of the @xmath0 in - medium self energy can at least in principle be studied from an examination of the energy dependence of the transparency ratio in the threshold region .",
    "uncertainties arise from the fact that not only the intrinsic properties of the @xmath0 meson but also the @xmath0 production cross section or its decay width can experience modifications from the interaction of the involved particles with the surrounding nuclear matter .",
    "any statement about the real part of the @xmath0 nucleus potential has to relie on assumptions for the elementary @xmath0 production cross section .",
    "it is also important to realize that the attenuation measurement as considered in the analysis at hand is sensitive not to the @xmath0 self energy at rest but to the @xmath0 properties at rather high momenta , i.  e. the momentum range around 1 gev .",
