    "in our previous paper ref .  @xcite we have introduced and studied an extensive class of a@xmath1os ( analytic difference operators ) admitting reflectionless eigenfunctions . our construction in ref .",
    "@xcite is patterned after the ist for schrdinger and jacobi operators . in brief , we start from given spectral data @xmath2 , and associate to these data a meromorphic reflectionless wave function @xmath3 and meromorphic coefficients @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( `` potentials '' ) of an a@xmath1o @xmath6 of the form @xmath7 such that we have the eigenvalue equation @xmath8    the data @xmath9 allowed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( from now on denoted by part  i ) gives rise to the poles of the transmission coefficient , just as for schrdinger and jacobi operators .",
    "it consists of complex numbers restricted by @xmath10 and @xmath11 this guarantees that the cauchy matrix @xmath12 is well defined and regular , just as the cauchy matrix pertinent to the schrdinger and jacobi cases .",
    "( 2.30)(2.33 ) in part  i , or , briefly , i(2.30)(2.33 ) . )    the `` normalization coefficients '' @xmath13 permitted in part  i are however far more general than for reflectionless schrdinger and jacobi operators .",
    "indeed , they are allowed to be meromorphic functions satisfying ( cf .",

    "iii of this series of papers  @xcite ( which deals with various functional - analytic features ) , we focus attention on the constant multiplier case . in sections  2 and 5 of the present paper , however , we allow the same multipliers as in part  i.    in section  2 we introduce time dependence in the multipliers @xmath16 .",
    "accordingly , the potentials @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath5 and wave function @xmath3 depend on time . the time dependence is chosen such that for each set of `` initial '' spectral data @xmath2 , we arrive at a solution to a nonlocal toda type equation . specifically , this equation reads @xmath17)-i\\exp(i[\\psi(x , t)-\\psi(x - i , t)]).\\ ] ] here , the function @xmath18 $ ] , @xmath19 , is assumed to be meromorphic in @xmath20 for all @xmath21 . with suitable restrictions on the data @xmath22 , @xmath23 , we show that our solutions to ( [ ruijsenaars : nonto ] ) are real - valued , real - analytic functions for real @xmath20 , @xmath21 , with a solitonic long - time behavior ( in section  6 ) .",
    "soliton equations of this nonlocal type have been introduced and studied before , cf .",
    "santini s review ref .",
    "@xcite and references given there .",
    "( in particular , when one replaces the lhs of ( [ ruijsenaars : nonto ] ) by @xmath24 , then one obtains the so - called intermediate toda lattice @xcite . )",
    "even so , it seems that ( [ ruijsenaars : nonto ] ) is a new soliton equation , in the sense that there appears to be no obvious transformation relating it to previously known soliton equations .",
    "we should stress at this point that we do not associate to ( [ ruijsenaars : nonto ] ) a clear - cut auxiliary linear spectral problem for self - adjoint a@xmath1os on @xmath25 .",
    "in fact , we view it as a challenging open problem to do so , in such a way that the self - adjoint a@xmath1os of part  iii  @xcite arise as the ones with vanishing reflection .    in sections  3 and 4 we present further results that render the existence of such a scenario plausible .",
    "indeed , in these sections we show that our ( constant multiplier ) a@xmath1os can be related to the well - known reflectionless schrdinger and jacobi operators , respectively .",
    "moreover , in section  4 we show that the corresponding solutions to ( [ ruijsenaars : nonto ] ) obtained in section  2 are related in the same way to the toda lattice solitons .    just as part",
    "i  @xcite , sections  24 are basically self - contained , in the sense that we need not invoke any substantial previous results in the literature .",
    "( to be sure , the previous ,  `` ist - based '' , literature in the kdv and toda lattice settings did provide considerable inspiration for this paper as well as part  i. ) for example , we obtain the solution property for the toda lattice solitons as a corollary of the corresponding result in section  2 .",
    "in contrast , section  5 ( and section  6 , too ) involves previous work of ours : we demonstrate there that the reflectionless wave functions and a@xmath1os can be connected to a special class of relativistic calogero  moser type systems .",
    "we have labeled the pertinent finite - dimensional soliton systems by @xmath26 in our paper  @xcite ; more general integrable @xmath0-particle systems of calogero  moser and toda type are surveyed in our lecture notes ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this relation plays an important role in part  iii .",
    "it enables us to invoke various results from ref .",
    "@xcite to control analytical difficulties .",
    "staying within the context of the present paper , it yields a map from an arbitrary point in the @xmath27 @xmath0-body phase space to a ( real - valued ) @xmath0-soliton solution of ( [ ruijsenaars : nonto ] ) . as such",
    ", it gives rise to one more example of what we have dubbed soliton - particle correspondence in our survey ref .",
    "@xcite . in this connection",
    "we also mention previous results on this correspondence for the kdv and toda lattice solitons  @xcite , and more recent results on the relation between relativistic calogero  moser systems and the 2d toda field theory  @xcite .",
    "a novel feature of the correspondence in the present setting is that our general @xmath0-soliton solutions to ( [ ruijsenaars : nonto ] ) are encoded via the _ defining _ lax matrix of the @xmath27 system , and not via the dual ( `` action - angle '' ) lax matrix ( as is the case for the sine - gordon and modified kdv particle - like solutions @xcite ) .",
    "to be more specific , the general @xmath0-soliton solution consists of @xmath28 solitons moving to the right , and @xmath29 solitons moving to the left .",
    "the right - movers and left - movers are parametrized by the particle and antiparticle variables , respectively .",
    "when @xmath30 or @xmath31 vanishes , one is dealing with a self - dual pair of lax matrices , so this new feature plays no role .    for @xmath32",
    ", however , self - duality breaks down . in that case the correspondence between right-/left - movers and particles / antiparticles is quite different from the correspondence between solitons , antisolitons and breathers in the sine - gordon and modified kdv settings on the one hand , and particles , antiparticles , and their bound states in the @xmath27 system on the other hand .",
    "the consequences of this novel type of correspondence are made explicit in section  6 , where we study the @xmath0-soliton solutions to ( [ ruijsenaars : nonto ] ) .",
    "first of all , we demonstrate that the pertinent solutions deserve their name .",
    "indeed , we show that for long times they can be approximated by linear combinations of @xmath0 1-soliton solutions ; moreover , the asymptotic velocities are conserved and the position shifts are factorized in terms of pair shifts .",
    "we obtain the features just mentioned in a quite direct and elementary fashion , yielding however a weaker approximation result than we obtained for the sine - gordon and ( m)kdv solitons in section  7 of ref .",
    "just as in all cases studied previously , the long - time behavior of the @xmath0-soliton solutions is intimately related to the spectral asymptotics for @xmath33 of time - dependent matrices .",
    "when @xmath31 or @xmath30 vanishes , we show that our results in _ loc .",
    "_  give rise to a natural notion of global , non - intersecting , space - time trajectories for the @xmath0 right - moving or @xmath0 left - moving solitons .",
    "for @xmath32 , however , we wind up with non - intersecting space - time trajectories only for sufficiently large times . in between , trajectories are ill - defined , since a collision of two trajectories typically gives rise to a complex - conjugate pair of eigenvalues . from a physical viewpoint ,",
    "the right - moving soliton ( `` particle '' ) and left - moving soliton ( `` antiparticle '' ) involved in the collision form a resonance for a certain period of time .",
    "we begin by collecting the definitions of various important quantities , cf .  section  2 in part  i. we have already recalled the restrictions on the spectral data @xmath2 and the definition of the cauchy matrix @xmath34 , cf .  (",
    "[ ruijsenaars : req1])([ruijsenaars : mu ] ) .",

    "we denote partial differentiation with respect to @xmath21 by a dot .",

    "in this section we clarify the relation of the above a@xmath1os and their reflectionless eigenfunctions to the reflectionless self - adjoint schrdinger operators considered in the ist framework  @xcite .",

    "( for @xmath552-values not in @xmath553 , however , theorem  a2 does apply to @xmath555 , entailing simple and positive spectrum for @xmath556 sufficiently large . )    as a consequence , we deduce that for @xmath557 the matrix ( [ ruijsenaars : lj ] ) has a non - degenerate eigenvalue @xmath558 .",

    "( for one thing , the choice of @xmath564 _ depends _ on the @xmath430 we fix . )    in any event , by now it will be clear what spectral feature our trajectory conjecture amounts to : for large times @xmath21 , the matrix @xmath492 should have a non - degenerate eigenvalue  1 for @xmath0 and only @xmath0 positions @xmath565  the soliton space - time trajectories .",
