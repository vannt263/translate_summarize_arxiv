    "the negative parity hyperon @xmath1 is interested for many years and several interpretations are proposed .",
    "the most simplest one is so called p - wave excited 3-quark system . such system is studied , for example , by isgur and karl using harmonic - oscillator and one - gluon - exchange perturbation , and by furuichi as a bound state problem .",
    "it turns out that to reproduce mass of @xmath0 is difficult in this approach .",
    "a lattice study shows that the flavor singlet 3-quark system with @xmath2 , can not be so light as @xmath0 .",
    "the most popular scenario today is bound @xmath3 system or dynamically generated resonance in meson - baryon scattering . in this decade , mason - baryon coupled channel scattering are studied extensively . there , several baryons including @xmath0 , are generated dynamically as a resonance or a quasi bound state which decay to open channels .",
    "most of studies based on the chiral lagrangian and the bethe - salpeter equation . besides these scenario",
    ", pentaquark is a possible interpretation of the hyperon . here ,",
    "pentaquark stands for a state with five valence constituents . in other words , it s quark number decomposition starts form @xmath4 states . by today",
    ", we do not have established pentaquark .",
    "indeed @xmath5 is a good candidate though it s existence is still questionable .",
    "therefore , if @xmath0 is well described as a pentaquark , we encounter exotic pentaquark baryon for the first time .",
    "to make negative parity baryon with four quarks and one anti - quark , it is simplest to put all quarks and antiquark into the ground s - wave orbit , namely s - shell pentaquark .",
    "the whole system should be color singlet for the qcd quark confinement .",
    "on top of that , 4-quark subsystem must be totally antisymmetric from the fermi statistics .",
    "there are several flavor - spin configuration satisfying these conditions .",
    "we consider three configurations where 4-quark subsystem is combined to @xmath6_f } ~,~ \\bf { [ 3,1]_s } \\,)$ ] and @xmath6_f } ~,~ \\bf { [ 2,2]_s } \\,)$ ] and @xmath7_f   } ~,~ \\bf { [ 3,1]_s } \\,)$ ] in flavor and spin space respectively . with the @xmath8_f$ ]",
    "subsystem , pentaquark is flavor singlet with an antiquark . while , the @xmath9_f$ ] one leads flavor octet and anti - decuplet pentaquarks , where one @xmath10 hyperon exist at center of octet . in all , we have three @xmath11 pentaquarks , two flavor single and one octet . in the conventional 3-quark approach ,",
    "@xmath0 is flavor singlet . while , in the chiral unitary model , one pole corresponding to @xmath0 is almost flavor octet@xcite .",
    "we define unperturbed pentaquark states as @xmath12 a product of the ground states of valence quark localized by a potential @xmath13 , and introduce a residual interaction @xmath14 by which valence ( anti-)quark emits and absorbs perturbative gluon and octet pseudoscalar meson or ng - bosons . here , the quark - meson coupling term is determined so that it recovers the chiral symmetry broken by the scalar potential @xmath15 .",
    "we set up perturbation @xmath16   | b \\rangle^0 $ ] where baryon matrix element of a local operator is calculated with the unperturbed state and the interaction . thus , quark correlation and supplementing meson cloud extra quarks in baryon , are introduced .",
    "this formalism is developed at tbingen originally for nucleon , and we call it the perturbative chiral quark model@xcite",
    ".    we ve tested this pentaquark picture of @xmath0 by studying magnetic moment , mass shift and @xmath17-term .",
    "it turns out there is two pentaquark @xmath0 almost degenerated , one flavor singlet and one flavor octet .",
    "this feature is common with the chiral unitary model . in this paper",
    ", we study decay rate of the system .",
    "pentaquark can decay via a characteristic mechanism called the fall - apart where it simply separate into baryon@xmath18 and meson@xmath19 , namely baryon emit meson without creating @xmath20 .",
    "hosaka studied @xmath21 decay via this mechanism@xcite .",
    "they obtained @xmath22 mev for @xmath23 configuration and conclude that @xmath5 can not be @xmath23 .",
    "we follow the paper and calculate the decay rate of @xmath24 .",
    "the decay rate is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is released momentum with @xmath27 mev . to reproduce empirical decay rate of @xmath28 mev , the transition amplitude @xmath29 should be around @xmath30 .",
    "this amplitude is determined by the interaction lagrangian with @xmath31 .",
    "it is calculated by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the spectroscopic factor the amplitude with which pentaquark @xmath0 contain @xmath34 component , namely @xmath35 .",
    "we obtain @xmath36 for @xmath37 respectively by using explicit pentaquark wave function .",
    "following the paper by hosaka , we borrow a non - relativistic gaussian wave function @xmath38 with @xmath39 @xmath40 for valence quark . with this , the relative and c.m .",
    "coordinates of @xmath41 are easily separated and we obtain @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "we calculate the amplitude eq.([eqn : amp ] ) using the matrix element eq.([eqn : mat ] ) .",
    "first , we use the typical linear scalar potential @xmath44 with @xmath45 gev@xmath46 and low energy constant @xmath47 mev . the coupling @xmath48 is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : couplings ] .",
    "the amplitude is obtained as @xmath49 , which is four times larger than one of empirical data , and gives much large decay rate of @xmath50 mev .",
    "we need to reconsider choice of potential to localize valence quark . in the original perturbative chiral quark model for nucleon ,",
    "a quadratic potential @xmath15 and @xmath51 are used . that potentials are essentially same as the linear @xmath15 , for nucleon , although they do nt give negative energy bound states .",
    "the coupling in this case is show in fig .",
    "[ fig : couplings ] . with this coupling ,",
    "the amplitude is still large value of 4.0 yet . in the paper by hosaka",
    ", a conventional constant coupling @xmath52 is used .",
    "if we use this coupling , the amplitude becomes @xmath53 , which is one half of the first result and gives @xmath54 mev .",
    "the result is larger than data but not so far from it .",
    "we see that the size of fall apart decay rate depends strongly on the choice of the quark - meson coupling . from the chiral symmetry point of view",
    ", the coupling should be given by the scalar potential to localize valence quarks .",
    "however , such couplings give large decay rate as shown above .",
    "weaker @xmath15 with supplementing @xmath51 can give reasonable amplitude , however we know that @xmath15 is important to produce meson cloud for nucleon property , for example @xmath55-n @xmath17-term . the matrix element in eq([eqn :",
    "mat ] ) ignore small component of quark wave function . taking small component",
    "may change the results considerably .",
