    "future galaxy surveys will provide new opportunities to verify the current standard cosmological model , and also to constrain modified gravity theories , invoked to explain the present accelerated expansion of the universe . before studying general parametrizations of dark energy , its however important to understand first which quantities can be really observed . from this direction",
    "recently @xcite shown that cosmological measurements can determine , in addition to the expansion rate @xmath8 , only three additional variables @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , given by @xmath12 with @xmath2 is the growth function , @xmath3 is the galaxy bias with respect to the dark matter density contrast , and @xmath13 is the dark matter density contrast today . the functions @xmath14 ( the anisotropic stress @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 ( the clustering of dark energy @xmath17 ) , describe the impact of the dark energy on cosmological perturbations . in @xcite ,",
    "a fisher analysis was made using galaxy clustering , weak lensing and supernovae probes , in order to find the expected accuracy with which an euclid - like survey can measure the anisotropic stress @xmath14 , in a model - independent way .",
    "+ in this work we want to obtain some results on the intrinsic degeneracy on galaxy clustering measurements , using the quantities @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "we use a flat @xmath18cdm fiducial model , with @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , euclid - like survey specifications are used @xcite : we divided the redshift range @xmath25 $ ] in 5 bins of width @xmath26 and one of width @xmath27 ; a spectroscopic error @xmath28 , and a fraction of sky @xmath29 ; the bias @xmath3 in the fiducial is assumed to be unity .",
    "observations of the growth rate @xmath4 from large scale structures using redshift space distortions ( rsd ) , give a direct way to test different dark energy models , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let us consider now the galaxy power spectrum in redshift space @xmath30 whit @xmath31 , and we explicitly use @xmath32 .",
    "the fisher matrix is in general @xmath33 where @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the effective volume of the survey @xmath36 @xmath37 being the galaxy number density in each bin .",
