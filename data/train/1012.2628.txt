    "in networks , packets have to be routed between nodes through a series of intermediate relay nodes . each intermediate node in the network may receive packets via multiple data streams that are routed simultaneously from their source nodes to their respective destinations . in such conditions , packets may have to be stored at intermediate nodes for transmission at a later time .",
    "if buffers are unlimited , intermediate nodes need not have to reject or drop arriving packets .",
    "however , in practice , buffers are limited in size .",
    "although a large buffer size is preferred to minimize packet drops , large buffers have an adverse effect on the _ latency _ , i.e. , the delay experienced by packets stored in the network .",
    "further , using larger buffer sizes at intermediate nodes would also result in secondary practical issues such as increased memory - access latency .",
    "though our work is motivated by such concerns , our work is far from modeling realistic conditions .",
    "this work modestly aims at providing a theoretical framework to understand the fundamental limits of single information flow in finite - buffer line networks and investigates the tradeoffs between throughput , packet delay and buffer size .",
    "the problem of computing capacity and designing efficient coding schemes for lossy wired and wireless networks has been widely studied  @xcite . however , the study of capacity of networks with finite buffer sizes has been limited .",
    "this can be attributed solely to the fact that analysis of finite buffer systems are generally more challenging . with the advent of network coding as an elegant and effective tool for attaining optimum network performance ,",
    "the interest in finite - buffer networks has increased  @xcite .",
    "the problem of studying lossy networks with finite buffers has been investigated in the area of queueing theory under a different but similar framework .",
    "the queueing theory framework attempts to model packets in a network as customers , the delay due to packet loss over links as service times in the nodes , and the buffer size at intermediate nodes as the queue size .",
    "further , the phenomenon of packet overflow in communications network is modeled by blocking ( commonly known as _ type ii _ or _ blocking after service _ ) in queueing networks  @xcite",
    ". however , this packet - customer equivalence fails in general network topologies due to the following reason .",
    "when the communications network contains multiple disjoint paths from the source to the destination , the source node can choose to duplicate packets on multiple paths to minimize delay .",
    "this replicating strategy can not be captured directly in the customer - server based queueing model .",
    "therefore , the queueing framework can not be directly applied to study packet traffic in general communications networks . however , queueing theory offers solid foundation for studying buffer occupancies and packet flow traffic in line networks .",
    "there has been extensive study in queueing theory literature on the behavior of open tandem queues , which are analogous to line networks  @xcite .",
    "however , approaches from queueing theory literature predominantly consider a continuous - time model for arrival and departure of customers / packets . in this work",

    "this model is similar to those in  @xcite .",
    "the broad contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows .",
    "the bulk of this work operates under the assumption of perfect hop - by - hop feedback .",
    "we present a markov - chain based model for exact analysis of line networks .",
    "the capacity of a line network is shown to be related to the steady - state distribution of an underlying chain , whose state space grows exponentially in the number of hops in the network .",
    "simple assumptions of renewalness of intermediate packet processes are employed to estimate the capacity of such networks .",
    "the estimates are exact for two - hop networks . however , the estimates extend the results of  @xcite to networks of any number of hops and buffer sizes of intermediate nodes . using the estimates ,",
    "the profile of packet delay is derived and studied .",
    "using the exact markov chain model in conjunction with network coding , it is shown that the throughput capacity is not affected by the absence of feedback in line networks .",
    "this result is similar to the information - theoretic result that feedback does not increase capacity of point - to - point channels  @xcite .",
    "finally , simulations reveal that our estimates closely predict the trends and tradeoffs between hop - length , buffer size , latency , and throughput in these networks .",

    "subsequently , we present our approaches to approximate the capacity of a line network . in the concluding subsection , we illustrate that the throughput capacity remains unaltered when feedback is absent provided packet - level network coding is allowed .",

    "notice that in the above scheme , at each epoch , the buffer of the last intermediate node is updated first , and the buffer of the first intermediate node is updated last . to determine the throughput capacity of the network , we need to track the number of packets that each node possesses at every instant of time by using the rules of buffer update under the above optimal scheme .",

    "@xmath85    the dynamics given by the above equation can be depicted pictorially by the chain in fig .",
    "note that due to the finite buffer condition and the non - negativity of occupancy , the transitions from the first block and from the last block differ from the transitions from the blocks between them .",

    "any horizontal transition involving a decrease in the second component is always feasible ( provided the second component of the starting state is positive ) . *",

    "we can define a finite sequence of matrices by @xmath111 note that these matrices relate the steady - state distribution @xmath112 of the states in @xmath86 , @xmath87 by @xmath113 . using these relations ,",
    "we can , in theory , estimate the capacity by @xmath114 however , this matrix - norm approach does not provide insight into occupancy statistics of various nodes .",
    "therefore , we focus on an approximations - based approach to capacity estimation in the remainder of this work .      in queueing theory , problems of identifying the steady - state probability of stochastic networks have often been dealt with approximations .",
    "most approaches to problems in this area have been to approximate the dynamics of the network by focussing on local dynamics of the network around each node and the edges incident with it .",
    "the key idea in this section is to modify the exact markov chain to derive bounds on throughput capacity .",
    "to do so , notice that the main reason for intractability of the exact system is the strong dependence of @xmath50 on not only @xmath115 , but also @xmath116 .",
    "this dependence translates to a strong dependence of @xmath117 on both @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "relaxation of this strong dependence will be a step towards possible decoupling of the system , and a deeper understanding of the tradeoffs in such networks .",
    "consider a network operation mode where each intermediate note transmits an acknowledgement whenever it _ receives _ a packet ( as opposed to the rate - optimal setting where it sends an acknowledgement whenever it _ receives and stores _ a packet successfully ) . under this new mode of operation",
    ", we notice that the dependence of the state of @xmath48 node on that of nodes further downstream is eliminated .",
    "this mode of operation is equivalent to assuming that a packet that arrives at a node whose buffer is full gets lost / dropped unlike the optimal mode of operation where it gets re - serviced . in this mode ,",

    "then , for any @xmath120 and @xmath127 , the following holds .",
    "@xmath128    the proof is detailed in appendix  [ app.1 - 2 ] .",
    "the temporal boundedness property guarantees that statistically , the probability that a node has an empty buffer is overestimated by the amc .",

    "using the temporal boundedness property in conjunction with ( [ fb - eqn5.1 ] ) , we can provide a lower bound @xmath133 for the capacity of the line network by underestimating the probability in ( [ fb - eqn5.1 ] ) by using the steady - state distribution of the amc instead of that of the emc .",
    "equivalently , the capacity of the line network is at least that of the throughput achievable by the amc .",
    "this above idea of lower bound extends easily to an upper bound using the following result .",

    "therefore , a straightforward hop - by - hop analysis ( without further assumptions ) seems insufficient to identify the capacity of such networks .      in this section , we present two iterative estimates for the capacity of line networks that is based on certain simplifying assumptions regarding the emc .",
    "we notice that the difficulty of exactly identifying the steady - state probabilities of the emc stems from the finite buffer condition that is assumed .",
    "the finite buffer condition introduces a strong dependency of state update at a node on the state of the node that is downstream .",
    "this effect is caused by blocking when the state of a node is forced to remain unchanged because the packet that it transmitted is successfully delivered to the next - hop node , but the latter is unable to store the packet due to lack of space in its buffer .",
    "additionally , the non - tractability of the emc is compounded by a non - renewal packet departure process from each intermediate node . in this section ,",
