    "the most extreme magnetic fields in the universe have been detected from a group of isolated neutron stars , known as magnetars .",
    "about 24 magnetars have been identified so far .",
    "most of them were discovered in the x - ray band , either from the emission of energetic bursts or pulsed emission with unique characteristics .",
    "timing analyses of their persistent emission reveal that the magnetars spin slowly ; their spin periods are in a tight range of @xmath1s and they experience large spin down rates ( @xmath2ss@xmath3 ) .",
    "the dipole magnetic field strengths inferred from these spin properties are mostly of the order of @xmath4 g @xcite .",
    "the luminosities of their persistent x - ray emission are between @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7ergs@xmath3 , or lower .",
    "the emission of occasional energetic bursts has become a general characteristics of magnetars : bursts have been observed from all but three confirmed magnetars .",
    "the peak luminosities of magnetar bursts or flares vary in more than eight orders of magnitude ( @xmath8ergs@xmath3 ) .",
    "short bursts , which typically last for @xmath9ms and with peak luminosities lower than @xmath10ergs@xmath3 , are the most common population .    both persistent x - ray and occasional burst emission can be accounted for under the scheme of the magnetar model @xcite . in this picture",
    ", the magnetic field of the neutron star plays a crucial role in generating both types of emission .",
    "the persistent emission is expected from a hot spot on the neutron star surface heated by the decay of the strong magnetic field of the neutron star .",
    "the bursts might originate from the energy release either through fracturing of the neutron star crust due to large magnetic stress , or the split and reconnection of the oppositely oriented magnetic field lines @xcite .",
    "magnetars occasionally undergo outburst episodes during which they experience remarkable increase in their persistent energy output , always in conjunction with the emission of energetic short bursts @xcite .    in the magnetar model , small scale fracturing of the neutron star crust",
    "is invoked to explain a portion of the persistent x - ray emission , while large fractures can manifest themselves as bursts @xcite .",

    "we also previously studied spectral properties of the low fluence bursts and the persistent emission , both observed in a deep _ xmm - newton _ observation of on its most burst active day @xcite . instead of phenomenological functions , we adopted physically motivated models for both persistent and burst spectra . in particular , we used the surface thermal emission with magnetosphere scattering model ( stems ) and magnetic field strength ( @xmath12 ) ; the thermal electron speed ( @xmath13 ) and the optical depth ( @xmath14 ) of the scattering plasma in the magnetosphere .",

    "both models include the same resonant cyclotron scattering by non - relativistic electrons in a warm magnetospheric plasma @xcite .",
    "our spectral analyses showed that the persistent and burst emission are better described with the stems and mbb+rcs model , respectively , which indicated that the persistent x - ray emission and low fluence bursts originate through slightly different physical processes .",
    "it is , therefore , crucial to systematically study temporal and spectral properties of the low fluence magnetar bursts , in order to better understand the nature of these weak bursts and their connection with the persistent emission .",
    "however , identifying the very weak magnetar bursts using conventional techniques is a challenging task .",
    "a major fraction of these bursts are usually smoothed out in binned data .",
    "also it is difficult to distinguish dim bursts from fluctuations of the persistent emission . as a result ,",
    "the burst search methodology in our earlier study using binned data limited us to include even weaker bursts and understand their characteristics through detailed spectral and temporal analyses .    a possible way to identify weak magnetar bursts",
    "is using the bayesian blocks method . the bayesian block representation of time series is a nonparametric method to detect local structures especially in highly variable data sets @xcite .",
    "it can provide a simple description of the overall shape of a burst temporal profile as well as a direct measurement of the burst duration .",

    "swift_/bat ; also has been applied to search for the extended emission from short grbs @xcite and to calculate the duration of grbs observed with _",
    "moreover , the bayesian blocks method has been used in the spatial domain to confirm the source detection in _ fermi_/lat data .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce the bayesian blocks method , for the first time , to identify very dim magnetar bursts using unbinned data of and collected with _",
    "xmm - newton _ and _ swift_/x - ray telescope ( xrt ) , respectively .",
    "we also investigate the temporal and spectral properties of the identified burst sample .",

    "we examine the accumulated spectra of dim bursts with physically motivated emission models , and present the results of our detailed spectral analysis .",
    "we construct and evaluate the fluence distributions of the dimmest bursts for both sources in section 6 , and finally discuss the implications of our results in section 7 .",
    "in the past five years , only two magnetars , and , experienced very active burst emitting episodes , during which tens or even hundreds of bursts had been observed with several x - ray and soft @xmath16-ray telescopes .",
    "we investigated the observations of these two sources during their most burst active episodes . in our investigations , we focused on energies below 10kev , since the persistent emission was mainly detected in this energy range .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    , a magnetar located in the anti - galactic center direction , was discovered with the detection of a series of short bursts starting on 2008 august 22 with _ swift _ , _",

    "this observation was carried out in small window mode of the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) pn instrument @xcite .",
    "the temporal resolution in this observing mode is 5.7 ms , that is fine enough to study short bursts .",
    "we selected the source counts from a circular region with a radius of @xmath20 centered at the source location .",
    "the background region was selected with the same aperture size from a source free portion on the same chip .",
    "we processed the data using sas version 11.0.0 with the latest calibration files generated on 2012 may 18 .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    is one of the few magnetars that have been detected in both radio and x - ray bands .",
    "the source was first identified in x - rays @xcite , and was suggested as an anomalous x - ray pulsar associated with a young supernova remnant g@xmath21 based upon its x - ray spectral properties @xcite . its magnetar nature has been confirmed with the detection of the radio pulsations with a period of 2.096s , the shortest one among all known magnetars , and a period derivative of @xmath22ss@xmath3 , which yields a dipolar magnetic field of @xmath23 g @xcite .",

    "its identification as a magnetar , has been monitored with _",
    "in this work , we selected two observations ( 00340573000 & 00340573001 ) , both performed on 2009 january 22 with a total exposure time of 15.8 ks .",
    "these observations were carried out in window timing mode , which sacrifices one dimension of the spatial image for the high temporal resolution of 1.766 ms .",
    "we selected the source region as a 34 pixel slide centered at the source position which corresponded to @xmath24 . due to the one dimension image and the wide psf ,",
    "the event list from the selected source region is actually the combination of the emission from the source , dust halo and sky background . in order to eliminate the contribution of the dust halo and the sky background on the burst spectra",
    ", we extracted the background spectrum from the same region during the burst - free time intervals .",
    "in the bayesian blocks method , data are represented with a series of step functions , which can be in different sizes , determined by maximizing the block likelihood function . for the photon counting instruments , such as _ swift_/xrt and _ xmm - newton _",
    ", the detection probability of one event follows poisson statistics .",
    "the likelihood function ( @xmath25 ) for block @xmath26 is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the total number of events in block @xmath26 , @xmath29 is the expected count rate , and @xmath30 is the duration of block @xmath26 .    a priori information in this method is the improvement of the likelihood function by adding one more block .",
    "it depends on the number of events , as well as the false positive detection rate ( see equation 21 in * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite calibrated this value with large sets of simulations , and also showed that the detection sensitivity of this method can approach the ideal theoretical limits .",
    "the bayesian blocks method has three advantages in identifying short magnetar bursts .",
    "first , it avoids placing a priori limitation on the scale and resolution of the search .",
    "it is sensitive to short weak bursts which may be smoothed out when the data are binned .",
    "second , it is applicable to data with wide ranges of amplitude , time scales and noise levels . finally , it is possible to determine the duration of short bursts independent of any background modeling .",
    "we adopted the algorithm provided in @xcite , and generated automatic procedures to search for the bursts using the list of time - tagged events in a specified energy range , i.e. , @xmath31kev for the _ xmm - newton _ data and @xmath32kev for _ swift_/xrt data .",
    "our burst search procedure included two rounds of bayesian block representation .",
    "the first round was a blind search through the whole data set and aimed to find candidate burst blocks .",
    "the second round of bayesian block representation was performed to confirm the candidate burst blocks , along with sufficient burst - free intervals .    to optimize the computation time for the first round search",
    ", we employed a moving box - car approach : we calculated the bayesian block representation for a 20 s long observing window , starting from the beginning of the observation , and shifted forward by 10 s in each time . this way , the entire exposure span , except for the first and last 10 s segments of each continuous time interval , was covered twice by consecutive observing windows in our first round of search .",
    "we then selected all blocks with durations less than the spin period of the source as candidate burst blocks .",
    "we excluded the candidate blocks which lined up with a boundary of any 20 s segment , as they will be picked in the middle of the previous or the next segment .",
    "before the second round representation , we further gathered the candidate burst blocks into groups , in which the separation between any two adjacent blocks in the time series is smaller than 10 s. then , we performed the second round bayesian blocks representation on each group , using the time - tagged events within the time segment from 10 s before the first block to 10 s after the last block .",
    "in this way , we can confirm the candidate burst blocks with sufficient underlying emission ( background ) in both pre- and post - burst intervals and remove the duplicates .",
    "additionally , the policy we followed to form the groups guaranteed that all underlying emission time intervals are burst free .",
    "we firmly identified the magnetar bursts after two rounds of bayesian blocks representation as follows : we first selected the blocks with duration longer than 6 s as background and calculated the background count rate using the weighted mean of the background block rates .",
    "we then identified the blocks with duration less then the spin period of the source and count rate higher than the background level as burst blocks .",
    "finally , we combined any continuous burst blocks as parts of a single magnetar burst .",

    "therefore , we have 262 bursts , and they may have suffered by @xmath33 pile - up .",
    "we kept these two bursts in the sample since they would not significantly affect the accumulative analyses results . ] for further analyses .",
    "we studied the low - fluence burst stacked spectrum using the same observation in @xcite , where we excluded all the 100 ms bins with no more than 10 counts from the burst spectrum , due to the fact that it was difficult to distinguish the burst emission from the fluctuations of the persistent source in this flux regime . comparing these two samples , all intervals considered as bursts in @xcite",
    "are identified as bursts with the bayesian blocks algorithm . moreover , at least @xmath34 ( 165/262 ) of bursts identified with the bayesian blocks method are too dim to be determined as bursts in the previous study , and are analyzed for the first time here .",
    "these results show that our search method is successful in detecting of both bright and dim bursts , and also capable of identifying even weaker bursts from the fluctuations of the persistent emission .",

    "based on these , we can not conclusively determine whether these weak and long blocks of are indeed representing bursts or rapid enhancements of the persistent source emission .",
    "stacked spectra of all other types of bursts and entire events can not be fit with the stems model , and therefore , they likely represent a distinct origin other than the persistent emission . as a consequence",
    ", we strengthened the conclusion of @xcite with much dimmer magnetar bursts that the emergent spectra of the burst and persistent emission are characteristically different , even though their origin likely involve an underlying extremely strong magnetic field .",

    "we also found that for , the surface temperature and flux of the persistent emission ( obtained with the stems model ) can not be inferred from the extrapolation of the power law trend of neither all burst types , nor only the short burst blocks .",
    "it is important to note that the temperatures from stems and mbb+rcs models arise from different physical settings : the former is temperature of the thermal emission from the surface of the neutron star and the latter is the temperature of the thermalized bubble emission modified by the strong magnetic field .    the persistent emission flux of changed dramatically during its burst active episode in 2009 @xcite .",

    ", we compared the evolution of the persistent flux in conjunction with those of the burst number and the orbital averaged burst energy fluence ( see figure [ fig - bstperlead ] ) .",
    "we find that the burst rate peaks in the second xrt orbit , that is about 11 ks prior to the peak of the persistent flux ( count rate ) in the fourth orbit .",
    "this behavior indicates that the sudden release of a large amount of burst energy may ignite the heating up of the neutron star crust , and result with the increase of the temperature and flux of the persistent emission , which were observed by @xcite .",
    "we note the important fact that the rate of strong ( piled - up ) bursts also peaked in the fourth xrt orbit .",
    "therefore , it may also be possible that the strong bursts in the fourth orbit may have driven simultaneous persistent flux increase , rather than gradual surface heating .",

    "@xcite formed the fluence distribution of bursts using 29 events seen with gbm in the 8@xmath6200 kev and obtained a power law index of @xmath265 , which is much flatter than the trend at the lower energy level .",
    "this may indicate the fact that there is a break somewhere between the fluences of 4@xmath26610@xmath267 and 10@xmath268 erg @xmath101 .",
    "we have further investigated this possibility as follows : there were ten bursts detected from with gbm during the course of _ xmm - newton _ observation ( bursts @xmath269 in table 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "note the fact that fermi is in a low altitude orbit , therefore , the source was blocked by the earth by about 50% of the exposure of _ xmm - newton_. assuming that the source was emitting bursts at a constant rate ( which is implied from the _ xmm - newton _ observation ) , we considered that about 20 bursts must have been detected with gbm over the time that 320 bursts were recorded with _",
    "xmm - newton_. we then calibrated our fluence distribution using the ratio of the number of bursts detected by two instruments , and extrapolated the distribution to the higher fluence regime to estimate the number of bursts expected if there is no break ( namely , the index of @xmath270 spans over all fluences ) .",
    "we found that the expected number of bursts from power law distribution with index of @xmath270 is about two orders of magnitude lower than the number of bursts detected with gbm .",
    "this result strengthened the possibility that there might indeed be a break in the broad fluence distribution .",

    "a similar power law index was reported for the fluence distribution of bursts within the fluences of @xmath272erg@xmath101 @xcite .",
    "note that the upper fluence limit of our burst sample is nearly equal to the detection limit of gbm bursts .",
    "therefore , there is clearly no evidence for any break in the fluence distribution of over three orders of magnitude in fluence .    according to the magnetar model",
    ", the typical short bursts result from the release of crustal energy , triggered by the cracking of the neutron star crust by the strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the required crustal magnetic field strength can be estimated from the energy of a burst , the length of the crustal crack and the upper limit of the lattice strain , that is typically 10@xmath273 @xcite .",
    "moreover , one could also estimate the displacement of the magnetic footprints and the minimum excitation radius of the alfven wave by using the crack length and the magnetic field strength @xcite .",
    "our earlier stems model fit to the persistent emission of resulted in an average surface magnetic field strength of @xmath23 g for . using this value",
