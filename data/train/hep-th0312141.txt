    "over the last few years a novel renormalization group ( rg ) scenario with limit - cycle behavior has been discovered in various models in a variety of physical contexts , including nuclear physics @xcite , quantum field theory @xcite , quantum mechanics @xcite , superconductivity @xcite , bose - einstein condensation @xcite , and effective low energy qcd @xcite .",
    "the subject of duality cascades in supersymmetric gauge theory @xcite is also suggestive of limit - cycle behavior .",
    "the possibility of limit cycle behavior in the rg flow was considered as early as 1971 by wilson @xcite , however at the time no models with this behavior were known .",
    "the possibility of chaotic flows has also been recently considered @xcite .",
    "as is readily realized , models with cyclic rg flows have novel physical properties in comparison with theories with fixed points . for theories with bound states ,",
    "the general signature of the cyclic rg is an infinite tower of bound states with energies related by discrete scaling relations @xcite , i.e. a self - similarity of the spectrum under a discrete scale transformation .",
    "this property was termed russian doll scaling in @xcite for obvious reasons . on the other hand , for continuous quantum field theories without bound states ,",
    "the cyclic rg is manifested in the periodicity of the s - matrix as a function of energy @xcite , as anticipated already by wilson @xcite .",
    "the present article is a continuation of @xcite . in the latter paper , an exact s - matrix for the cyclic regime of the kosterlitz - thouless flows",
    "was proposed for the first time . using the s - matrices proposed there , here we investigate the finite - size effects , or equivalently the finite temperature effects , of the ground state energy @xmath2 on a circle of circumference @xmath3 ( temperature @xmath4 ) .",
    "conventionally one defines the effective central charge @xmath0 as @xmath5 .",
    "the quantity @xmath6 governs many physical properties , including the specific heat @xcite .",
    "it is known that for theories with fixed points , the quantity @xmath6 tracks the rg flow , namely , as a function of @xmath3 it smoothly interpolates between the ultra - violet ( uv ) , @xmath7 , and infra - red ( ir ) , @xmath8 , values of the virasoro central charge of the fixed points @xcite .",
    "for this reason @xmath6 is an interesting property to study for a model with an rg limit cycle , and this is the main subject of this paper . as we will show",
    ", it has a periodic structure as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "there is another c - function @xmath10 which also tracks the rg flow between fixed points , this being the content of the celebrated c - theorem @xcite , which is a statement of the irreversibility of the rg flow .",
    "specifically the theorem states that @xmath10 is a monotonically decreasing function of scale @xmath11 in the flow toward the ir .",
    "this by itself seems to rule out cyclic rg flows in unitary theories , since straightforward rg arguments show that @xmath12 should be periodic in @xmath13 .",
    "in fact the proof of the theorem constructs @xmath14 as a function of the couplings @xmath15 , and the flow of @xmath14 is induced from the flow of @xmath15 : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the @xmath18 function ; thus if the couplings are periodic , so is @xmath14 .",
    "whereas @xmath19 is related to a one - point function of the trace of the stress - energy tensor in a finite geometry ( see below ) , @xmath20 is related to a two - point function with fields separated by @xmath11 in infinite volume , and they are thus different .",
    "nevertheless , for models with fixed points both @xmath19 and @xmath10 have essentially the same behavior , and we expect the same to be true for a theory with a cyclic rg .",
    "this leaves us with a paradox , since our theory is a perturbation of a unitary conformal field theory by a hermitian operator .",
    "this issue will not be dealt with any further in this work .",
    "let us now summarize our main results . in section",
    "ii we outline the main features one expects for integrable , relativistic quantum field theories in 2d that have a cyclic rg , using only standard rg arguments in a model - independent way . there",
    "a clear distinction is made between massive and massless scattering theories . in section iii",
    "we review the definition of the models and rg flows , extending the arguments to higher level @xmath21 current algebras .",
    "we point out two possible limiting theories , one massive , the other massless , depending on whether one has a uv or ir fixed point in the isotropic limit . in section",
    "iv we describe the proposed s - matrices .",
    "the massive s - matrix is the same as considered in @xcite , whereas the massless one is new",
    ". both these s - matrices are periodic in rapidity , which as explained in section ii , is a clear signature of the cyclic rg . in section",
    "v we use thermodynamic bethe ansatz techniques to study the finite size effects for the massive case .",
    "though periodic structures consistent with the rg flows are found for @xmath6 , in the deep uv it develops a singularity whose nature is explored in some detail .",
    "we derive an approximate analytic expression for @xmath6 in terms of riemann s zeta function , eq .",
    "( [ clinear ] ) which is surprisingly simple and agrees very well with exact numerical results .",
    "the finite size - effects for the massless case are discussed in section vi ; however at the present time the appropriate thermodynamic bethe ansatz equations are unknown , and our analysis is thus incomplete .",
    "however on general grounds we argue that in the massless case @xmath6 should be an exactly periodic function of @xmath9 on all scales and has no singularities , and thus appears to be more consistent with the rg analysis .",
    "in this section we describe some general properties that a model with an rg limit cycle should exhibit , as a way of anticipating our subsequent results .    generally speaking , cyclic behavior in the rg flow can in principle exist at all scales , or can be approached asymptotically in the ultra - violet or infra - red , the latter being uv or ir limit - cycle behavior .",
    "once the flow is in the cyclic regime , the couplings are periodic [ ii.1 ] g(l + ) = g(l ) where @xmath22 and @xmath11 is the length scale . above , the period @xmath23 is fixed and model - dependent . in our model",
    "@xmath23 is an rg invariant function of the two running couplings .",
    "as we will review in the next section , our models have a periodic rg on all scales rather than a limit cycle .",
    "consider first a theory of massive particles . in the deep ir",
    ", the particles appear infinitely heavy and decouple , leaving an empty theory which can not support a low - energy limit cycle .",
    "therefore , we expect that a massive theory can only support a uv limit cycle",
    ". a massless theory on the other hand can be non - trivial in the ir and thus support an ir limit cycle or a limit cycle on all scales .",
    "we will explore both possibilities subsequently .",
    "it is well - known that the rg leads to certain scaling relations for the correlation functions ( callan - symanzik equations ) .",
    "since the s - matrix is obtained from momentum space correlation functions , it thus also obeys rg scaling relations .",
    "let @xmath24 denote the 2-particle to 2-particle s - matrix .",
    "for an integrable quantum field theory in 2 space - time dimensions , @xmath24 only depends on the kinematic variable @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the energy - momentum vectors of the incoming particles .",
    "( for an integrable theory , the incoming and outgoing momenta are the same . )",
    "standard rg arguments applied to the s - matrix lead to the scaling relation : [ ii.2 ] s ( e^-l , g(l_0 ) ) = s ( , g(l + l_0 ) ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite . ) for a theory with a limit cycle , when @xmath27 the above equation implies a periodicity in energy : [ ii.3 ] s ( e^- , g ) = s ( , g )    let us now specialize to 2d kinematics",
    ". first consider the massive case , where the energy momentum can be parameterized in terms of a rapidity @xmath28 : [ ii.4 ] e = m ,   p = m where @xmath29 is the mass of the particles .",
    "the center of mass energy is [ ii.5 ] ^2 = 2 m^2 ( 1 + ) ,  = _ 1 - _ 2  ( massive   case ) suppose this theory has a uv limit cycle . at high energies",
    "@xmath18 is large and @xmath30 .",
    "the relation eq .",
    "( [ ii.3 ] ) then implies a periodicity in rapidity : [ ii.6 ] s(- 2 ) = s ( )    we turn now to the massless case . here",
    "the massless dispersion relations @xmath31 can be parameterized as : e & = & e^_r ,   p = e^_r ,   for   right - movers + e & = & e^-_l ,   p = - e^-_l ,   for   left - movers [ ii.7 ] where now @xmath29 is an energy scale . the center of mass energy for a right - mover with rapidity @xmath32 scattering with a left - mover of rapidity @xmath33 is [ ii.8 ] = m e^/2 ,  = _ r - _ l ,  ( massless   case ) if @xmath34 is the s - matrix for the scattering of right - movers with left - movers , then eq .",
    "( [ ii.3 ] ) again implies a periodicity : [ ii.9 ] s_rl ( - 2 ) = s_rl ( )    one sees then that the main difference between the massive and massive case is that in the massive case the periodicity in rapidity eq .",
    "( [ ii.6 ] ) implies a periodicity in energy @xmath35 only for large @xmath35 , whereas in the massless case it leads to a periodicity at _ all _ energy scales .",
    "thus a massless theory with the periodicity eq .",
    "( [ ii.9 ] ) is consistent with a cyclic rg flow on all scales , whereas the massive case at best can correspond to a theory with a limit cycle only in the deep uv .",
    "let us consider the quantum field theory on a cylinder of finite circumference @xmath3 and length @xmath11 going to infinity . viewing the finite circumference",
    "as the space the hamiltonian lives on , and the length @xmath11 as the time , the partition function behaves as [ 4.1 ] z ~e^-l e(r ) where @xmath2 is the ground state energy of the hamiltonian at finite size @xmath3 .",
    "this ground state scaling function contains a lot of information about the theory . from @xmath2",
    "one conventionally defines the effective central charge @xmath0 : e(r ) = - [ gs1 ]    in theories with fixed points , @xmath36 is equal to the virasoro central charge @xmath37 at the fixed point , and smoothly interpolates between the ultra - violet and infra - red values of @xmath37 . for this reason ,",
    "it is very interesting to study @xmath0 in a theory with no fixed points but rather limit cycles .    in order to derive an rg scaling equation for @xmath6",
    "we first relate it to a correlation function .",
    "let @xmath38 denote the one - point function of the trace of the stress - energy tensor on the cylinder .",

    "i.e. @xmath41 is a periodic function of @xmath9 with period @xmath23 .",
    "in this section we describe an action for our model and review the beta - function and rg flows . consider a conformal field theory with @xmath42 symmetry , described formally by the action @xmath43 .",
    "the conformal symmetry promotes the @xmath42 symmetry to decoupled left - right current algebra symmetry @xcite , with left - moving ( right - moving ) currents @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , @xmath46 where @xmath47 are euclidean light - cone space - time variables .",
    "the currents are normalized to satisfy the following operator product expansion : [ 2.1 ] j^3 ( z ) j^3 ( 0 ) ~ ,   j^3 ( z ) j^(0 ) ~ j^(0 )   j^+ ( z ) j^- ( 0 ) ~ + j^3 ( 0 ) where @xmath21 is the level , and similarly for the right - moving currents .",
    "the simplest realization of the current algebra is in terms of a pair of dirac fermions , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 are pauli matrices , and corresponds to a @xmath50 reducible representation with virasoro central charge @xmath51 .",

    "the above periodicity is not approached asymptotically , but is present on all scales ; this will be an important criterion when we analyze the finite size effects .",
    "the limit @xmath71 corresponds to being on one of either of the two separatrices @xmath72 , which can be taken in the half - plane @xmath73 due to the symmetry @xmath74 .",
    "these two @xmath42 invariant theories are quite different .",
    "the theory with @xmath75 is a massive theory with uv fixed point at @xmath76 , and corresponds to the @xmath42 invariant limit of the usual massive sine - gordon theory with an empty ir fixed point .",

    "a massless s - matrix for this flow was given in ref .",
    "@xcite . these observations",
    "lead us to consider two different s - matrix theories for the region @xmath81 .",

    "@xcite the beta - functions are given for arbitrary level @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath21-dependence is quite simple and can be scaled out of the rg flows by defining a new couplings @xmath84 and a rescaled rg time @xmath85 . in terms of @xmath86 and",
    "@xmath87 the flow equations are the same as for @xmath50 .",

    "one sees that @xmath94 , and thus the period in @xmath40 is the same as for @xmath50 : @xmath95 when @xmath65 is defined in the manner eq .",
    "( [ 2.8 ] ) .    in the next section",
    "we will propose an s - matrix for the higher @xmath21 theories .",
    "in reference @xcite it was conjectured that the cyclic regime of the kt flows described in the last section has a spectrum consisting of a massive soliton and anti - soliton with topological charge @xmath96 .",
    "a factorisable s - matrix was proposed based on the @xmath97 quantum affine symmetry of the underlying hamiltonian where quantum parameter @xmath98 is related to the period @xmath99 of the rg cycles by the equation q = - e^- h/2 [ s1 ]    this value of @xmath98 is rather unusual for a relativistic factorized s - matrix theory .",
    "the other previously known models with s - matrices related to a quantum affine symmetry all correspond to @xmath98 a pure phase , and are models with fixed points corresponding to free bosons or their quantum group reductions to minimal models when @xmath98 is a root of unity .",
    "s - matrices with a real @xmath98 however do appear in the study of the xxz spin chain in the massive antiferromagnetic regime , where the solitons are understood as massive spinons .",
    "the relation of our model to the xxz spin chain was discussed in @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that in the low energy limit of small momentum , and as @xmath65 tends to zero , our s - matrix agrees with that of the spinons of the xxz spin chain .",
    "however , in contrast to the spin chain , our dispersion relation is relativistic on all energy scales , as appropriate to the relativistic field theory of the last section , and this is the main difference between the models . as we will see , the interesting properties of the finite - size effects which are a consequence of the cyclic rg only appear in the ultraviolet limit for this massive case , and are thus unlikely to be properties of the spin - chain since the latter has an explicit lattice cut - off which leads to a non - relativistic dispersion relation .",
    "we now describe in detail the s - matrix proposed in ref . @xcite . as usual",

    "the factor @xmath106 can be understood as the minimal solution to crossing and unitarity when @xmath98 is real .",
    "the arguments leading the above s - matrix are entirely independent of the rg analysis .",
    "indeed the s - matrix depends on the couplings @xmath57 only through the rg invariant @xmath65 .",
    "the physical mass @xmath29 also depends on the couplings , though in an unknown , non - perturbative fashion .",
    "it is therefore a non - trivial consistency check and confirmation of the cyclic rg if the s - matrix possesses the cyclicities discussed in section ii .",

    "( [ ii.6 ] ) with exactly the period @xmath107 predicted by the rg analysis based on the all - orders beta - function .",
    "this is easily verified since @xmath108 .",
    "recall that the period of the rg at one - loop is @xmath109 which is @xmath110 @xcite .",

    "s - matrices with real periodicities in the rapidity have previously been studied in @xcite .",

    "in these works , the s - matrix is expressed in terms of elliptic functions , whereas our s - matrix is trigonometric . for a single particle with diagonal scattering , crossing symmetry and unitarity lead to an imaginary @xmath111 periodicity , so that an additional real periodicity in @xmath18 naturally leads to the doubly periodic elliptic functions .",
    "our s - matrix on the other hand is non - diagonal , and thus is not @xmath112 periodic , which explains why it can be expressed in terms of trigonometric functions .",
    "one problem with the above massive s - matrix has already been alluded to . as discussed in section ii , the above periodicity in rapidity implies an rg limit cycle only in the deep uv , which contradicts the flows described in section iii which have limit cycles on all length scales .",
