    "the main body of ngc 3256 contains a dense population of clusters , many of which are embedded in the galaxy s dusty interstellar medium . the galaxy s intense star formation makes it an extreme environment in which to study cluster formation and destruction .",

    "( 2007b ) performed optical spectroscopy of 23 clusters in the main body of ngc 3256 , finding ages of a few to @xmath16 myr and masses from @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "goddard , bastian , & kennicutt ( 2010 ; hereafter g10 ) estimated ages and masses of ngc 3256 clusters from @xmath19 photometry using _ hst _ s advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) and estimated the fraction of stars forming in bound clusters , hereafter referred to as @xmath9 , to be @xmath20 .",
    "their method involved estimating the cluster formation rate ( cfr ) , taken from the total mass of clusters younger than 10 myr , and dividing by the galaxy s star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "some works , including g10 , have suggested that there is a correlation between @xmath9 and sfr density , @xmath0 ( e.g. , silva - villa & larsen 2011 ; cook et al . 2012 ) , and between @xmath21 ( the fraction of @xmath22 band light contained in clusters ) and @xmath0 ( larsen & richtler 2000 ; adamo stlin , & zackrisson 2011 ) .",
    "these relationships imply that the conditions for cluster formation are not universal , but are dependent on conditions in the host galaxy .",

    "we visually inspect all sources to remove cosmic rays and hot pixels from the catalog .",
    "the low galactic latitude of ngc 3256 means that there will be a significant number of foreground stars from the milky way in our images .",

    "we address incompleteness in our catalog by making a cut where the @xmath40 distribution begins to flatten at the faint end , rather than continue in a power law fashion . because the central portion of ngc 3256 is dustier and has a higher background level than the outer regions , we use separate completeness limits for the inner and outer regions .",

    "their final sample covered the central @xmath46 kpc@xmath47 and included 276 clusters after imposing various selection criteria on photometric uncertainty and on the goodness of fit to simple stellar population ( ssp ) models .",
    "the portion of ngc 3256 studied here extends the g10 coverage to include the northern spiral arm , as well as outside the central , brightest portion of the system ( as shown in figure [ image ] ) .",
    "in addition , we include h@xmath26 observations in our analysis , which can be critical for breaking the degeneracy between age and extinction , a degeneracy that affects a number of clusters in this merging system ( see section [ ha_calib ] for more details ) .",
    "our catalog includes more than @xmath48 of the sources that were found by g10 , when both catalogs are matched in area and magnitude ( @xmath49 ) .",

    "we add 0.05 in quadrature to @xmath60 to ensure that no single measurement dominates the sed fit .",
    "the bc06 model predicts a mass - to - light ratio ( for the @xmath29 band luminosity ) for each age , which we use to estimate a mass for each cluster .",
    "@xmath61 is calculated from each cluster s @xmath62 magnitude ( corrected for internal extinction ) and the distance modulus of ngc 3256 .",
    "the masses are computed using a chabrier ( 2003 ) initial mass function .",
    "broad - band colors alone make it difficult to differentiate clusters that are red because they are older from those that are young but appear redder due to the presence of dust .",
    "this is known as the age - extinction degeneracy . including h@xmath26 photometry as a fifth point in the sed",
    "can help to break this degeneracy and has been used in a number of studies to age - date clusters ( e.g. , fall , chandar , & whitmore 2005 ; chandar et al .",
    "2010 ) . in this section",
    "we describe our method for calibrating the h@xmath26 filter in order to use it in the sed fitting method .",
    "we first determine the zero point of the @xmath25 filter .",
    "we identify @xmath63 somewhat older star clusters , those that have only continuum emission from stars ( i.e. , no line emission from ionized gas ) .",
    "we estimate the age and extinction of each of these line - free clusters by performing the @xmath64 fit described in section [ fitting ] using only the @xmath19 filters to predict a magnitude in the @xmath25 band .",
    "comparison between the predicted and instrumental magnitudes gives a zero point of @xmath65 .",
    "we find that shifting the zero point by 0.1 alters the ages of only @xmath66 of the clusters by @xmath67 0.3 in log(@xmath68 ) .",
    "next , we assess whether or not we need to make an adjustment to the predictions for h@xmath26 line emission due to the escape of ionizing photons , as has been done in previous work on galaxies at closer distances ( e.g. , fall , chandar , & whitmore 2005 ; chandar et al .",
    "we compare the predicted and measured h@xmath26 maps for a subsample of hand - selected young clusters and find that , unlike for more nearby galaxies , no escape fraction is obviously needed .    in order to understand the impact that the escape fraction ( @xmath69 ) has on the cluster age estimation , we run the @xmath19h@xmath26 sed fitting with two values of @xmath69 ; we use the best fit @xmath69 of 0.25 , as well as @xmath70 .",
    "we find that @xmath71 of clusters have a difference in age of log@xmath72 between age estimations from the two escape fractions , and adopt @xmath70 for simplicity due to its negligible impact on age estimates .",
    "we test that cluster ages are reasonable by performing some simple checks . in most galaxies",
    ", it has been found that the brightest clusters tend to be young ( we discuss the physical implications of this in section [ cmf_sfr ] ; e.g. , whitmore et al .",
    "we test our sample by picking the brightest 15 clusters after correction for internal extinction and find that they are all younger than 10 myr .",
    "in addition , figure [ ha_ages ] shows a continuum - subtracted h@xmath26 map of ngc 3256 , with clusters overlaid that are color - coded by age .",
    "clusters younger than 10 myr ( blue circles ) tend to clump together and follow the brightest h@xmath26 regions , while @xmath73 myr old ( green ) and @xmath74 myr old ( red ) old clusters are more sparse and fall on areas with no h@xmath26 emission .",
    "we present the lfs for clusters in ngc 3256 in figure [ dndl ] .",
    "the lf is best described by a power law , @xmath75 , where @xmath26 is determined from a linear fit to log @xmath76 .",
    "the @xmath40 values have been aperture - corrected and corrected for foreground extinction in the galaxy .",

    "we find @xmath2 for the combined sample with @xmath77 .",
    "the lf for the inner and outer regions individually yielded @xmath78 in both cases .",
    "we also determine the power law index for the combined sample using @xmath13 and @xmath14 band magnitudes , and find @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",

    "in addition , our value for @xmath26 is similar to that found in many other galaxies ( whitmore et al .",

    "the solid lines show our brightness limits of @xmath85 ( @xmath86 for a distance modulus of 32.79 ) for the outer region and @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) for the inner region .",
    "the different completeness limits of the inner and outer regions result in different mass regimes in which the age distribution can be determined .",
    "the two dashed lines indicate the masses at which both samples are complete over the age ranges used in the age distribution ( figure [ dndt ] ) .",
    "the inner cluster sample is complete to log(@xmath89 for log(@xmath90 ) @xmath91 , while the outer sample is complete to log(@xmath92 for log(@xmath90 ) @xmath93 .",
    "the apparent lack of clusters in the range @xmath94 log@xmath95 is an artifact of the sed fitting , partially due to the bc06 track forming a loop in color space .",
    "we find that the age distribution follows a power law with @xmath96 , with @xmath97 for two independent mass ranges in both the inner and outer regions . the combined catalog from both regions yields @xmath98 for both mass ranges ; however , we note that the difference in completeness limits for the two catalogs results in a very low number of clusters for which the age distribution can properly be measured . the age distribution presented in figure 5 of g10 for clusters in ngc 3256 shows a similar declining shape to that presented here .",
    "fall & chandar ( 2012 ) find the cluster age distribution for multiple galaxies to be a power law with @xmath99 between @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "while the slope of the age distribution fluctuates somewhat depending on how the fit is performed , this fluctuation agrees well with the fitting errors shown in figure [ dndt ] , as well as with the uncertainties listed in fall & chandar ( 2012 ) .",
    "we conclude that @xmath99 for ngc 3256 is similar to the values obtained for the cluster populations in other galaxies , although several works find significantly flatter age distributions for clusters in some galaxies ( e.g. , hwang & lee 2010 ; baumgardt et al .",
    "2013 ; silva - villa et al .",
    "2014 ) , including recent work on m31 by the phat team ( fouesneau et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "the age distribution is a combination of the formation and disruption histories of the clusters .",
    "the star formation histories ( sfhs ) are known independently in a number of galaxies and appear to be relatively constant at least to within a factor of two over the last few hundred million years ( e.g. , smc  harris & zaritsky 2004 ; lmc  harris & zaritsky 2009 ) .",
    "unfortunately , to our knowledge , there is no published sfh for the merging , starbursting ngc 3256 system , either from direct observations or from high quality simulations .",
    "if the sfh of ngc 3256 has been constant to within a factor of a few over this timescale , as suggested by some simulations for the starbursting antennae galaxies ( karl , fall , & naab 2011 ) , as well as observational works on interacting galaxies ( e.g. , knapen , cisternas , & querejeta 2015 and references therein ) , then the clusters in ngc 3256 would also have a disruption history similar to that found in these more quiescent galaxies .",
    "we show the cmfs in figure [ dndm ] . these can be described by a power law , @xmath102 .",
    "we measure @xmath103 for three age ranges for clusters in the inner and outer areas of the galaxy , as well as for the combined sample .",
    "the given uncertainties only reflect the formal uncertainty in the fit ; we discuss other sources of error in section [ mf_err ] .    in the age range @xmath104 log@xmath105",
    ", we find that the combined sample of inner and outer clusters yields @xmath106 . separating the sample yields @xmath107 for outer clusters , but a shallower @xmath108 for inner clusters .",
    "the somewhat shallower slope is likely a result of crowding , which can artificially flatten the mass function .",
    "studies of other galaxies have also found @xmath109 ( e.g. , zhang & fall 1999 ; chandar , fall , & whitmore 2010 ; chandar et al .",
    "2010 ; chandar , fall , & whitmore 2015 ) .",
    "we note that g10 find @xmath110 for the same age range in ngc 3256 , quite similar to our result .",
    "we only determine the mass functions for older clusters in the outer region , since there are very few such clusters in the inner region .",
    "we find @xmath111 in the age range @xmath112 log@xmath113 .",
    "this age range is also the most difficult to fit , partially due to the loop in the bc06 track discussed in section [ agedist ] .",
    "clusters with ages @xmath114 log@xmath115 produce a mass function with @xmath116 , where the large uncertainty in fitting is due to small - number statistics .    in figure [ dndlogm_godd ]",
    ", we also show the mass function for ngc 3256 clusters younger than log(@xmath117 from the g10 sample .",
    "we find that their mass function shows an unexpected systematic offset toward lower masses .",
    "the offset is not due to differences in photometry , in ssp model assumptions , or in derived age or extinction values .",
    "when we put the g10 photometry through our age - dating procedure , no offset exists .",
    "the reason for the offset between the g10 cluster mass estimates and our own is unclear .",
    "several factors contribute to the uncertainty in the shape of the cmf .",
    "we mentioned some of these factors already in section [ ha_calib ] , such as the impact that small changes in the zero point and escape fraction for the h@xmath26 filter have on @xmath103 . in this section",
    ", we consider additional contributors to the uncertainties in @xmath103 .",
    "incompleteness can impact @xmath103 , causing it to become artificially shallow .",
    "this is especially true when considering @xmath103 for a very small age range , where brightness and mass are correlated , and a loss of faint clusters is equivalent to a loss of low - mass clusters .",
    "we discussed completeness of our catalog in section [ clus_sel ] , and we choose selection limits that are sufficiently bright that the impact of incompleteness is minimal .",
    "details of the fitting procedure can also affect @xmath103 .",
    "we find that the specific mass range used in the fits affects @xmath103 by less than about 0.05 for samples with 40 or more clusters , similar to most of the subsets quoted in this paper .",
    "we also measure the impact of bin size on @xmath103 and again find @xmath103 to fluctuate by @xmath118 .",
    "overall we find that all of these sources of uncertainty affect @xmath103 within the formal uncertainty given in figure [ dndm ] for each age range .",
    "some works have found that mass functions for clusters in spiral galaxies deviate from a single power law and have a downturn at the high - mass end ( e.g. bastian et al . 2012 ) .",
    "these works suggest that the mass function is better described by a schechter function , @xmath102exp(@xmath119 ) , where @xmath120 is the upper mass cutoff .",
    "while the lower - mass end of the schechter function converges to a power law with index @xmath103 , the high - mass end drops off from a power law quickly above @xmath120 .",
    "in ngc 3256 , we find that a single power law provides a good fit to the observed cmf , since no obvious downturn is observed at the high - mass end .",
    "therefore , our distribution is only consistent with a schechter function with a high @xmath120 ( consistent with the suggestion that any @xmath120 would be expected to be higher than @xmath52 @xmath18 for this type of system ; e.g. , kruijssen 2014 ) .",
    "below , we determine a lower limit to @xmath120 . for simplicity",
    ", we compare our cmfs for @xmath104 log@xmath105 and @xmath114 log@xmath121 to schechter functions with a fixed @xmath122 and varying @xmath120 values , although there is no reason why @xmath103 has to be exactly @xmath123 .",
    "for the latter age range , we use only the sample taken from the outer region of the central galaxy due to low - number statistics .    using this approach",
    ", the mass function of clusters with ages @xmath104 log@xmath105 can only be reasonably fit for a schechter function with log@xmath124 values above 6.5 . because the mass function is fit out to log@xmath125 , it is not surprising that schechter functions with log@xmath126 begin to fall below the observed mass function at the high - mass end .",
    "the left panel of figure [ dndm_schec ] shows the mass function with multiple @xmath120 values .    fitting the mass function for @xmath114 log@xmath121 with a schechter function is indistinguishable from fitting a pure power law for log@xmath127",
    "this is shown in the right panel of figure [ dndm_schec ] , where log@xmath128 and log@xmath129 provide reasonable fits to the mass function , as does a single power law .",
    "the mass function is fit out to log@xmath130 , and we find that the schechter functions with log@xmath131 begin to fall below the observed mass function at the high end .",
    "we find little evidence for a truncation of the mass function at the high end .",
    "we conclude that while both mass functions tested here can be fit with a schechter function , it is not required and that a single power law provides an equally good fit to each .",
    "we therefore favor a pure power law in fitting the mass functions .",
    "the specific method used to select star clusters , particularly at ages @xmath5 myr , may affect the results ( e.g. , bastian et al .",
    "in addition , cluster selection in galaxies located at different distances will necessarily be limited by resolution since at least some sources will appear as diffuse stellar clusters in nearby galaxies but not in more distant ones .    at a distance of 36 mpc ,",
    "ngc 3256 is nearly twice as far as the antennae , the nearest example of a pair of actively merging galaxies . in order to assess how distance might impact source selection , as well as the lfs , mass functions , and age distributions of cluster populations in ngc 3256",

    "we refer to the cluster catalogs produced from the unaltered and degraded images as the `` original '' and `` image - smoothed '' catalogs , respectively .",
    "we perform aperture photometry on all detected sources and correct for foreground extinction .",

    "figure [ ant_image ] shows a comparison of the original and image - smoothed @xmath132 images .",
    "the circles indicate detections from daofind .",
    "it is evident that the image - smoothed source catalog is missing many of the very faint clusters in addition to some of the bright sources .",
    "we illustrate this in figure [ ant_dndl ] , where the bottom panel shows the relative fraction of sources found in the image - smoothed catalog compared to the original catalog .",

    "both lfs are fit for @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) , where the @xmath40 distribution begins to flatten out at the faint end .",
    "we find values for @xmath26 of @xmath137 for the clusters detected in the original image , very similar to those found in previous works .",
    "for the smoothed image sample we also find @xmath138 .",
    "a similar and more extensive study was performed by randriamanakoto et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , where it was also determined that @xmath26 is not greatly impacted by resolution .",
    "they performed various convolutions on their image in order to simulate different galaxy distances , finding that @xmath26 differed by no more than 0.2 .",
    "the color distributions of clusters brighter than @xmath136 from the original and smoothed images are quite similar . while there are more points from the original catalog present in figure [ ant_ccd ] , the scatter in the colors among the two catalogs is roughly the same .",
    "we run sed fitting on both catalogs and construct their age distributions ( not shown ) , finding @xmath139 in both cases .",
    "we find that the lf , color distributions , and age distributions for the original and image - smoothed catalogs are nearly the same , and we therefore conclude that distance does not significantly hamper our ability to study clusters out to @xmath140 mpc .",
    "many previous works have suggested that galaxies with a high sfr per unit area ( @xmath0 ) form clusters more efficiently than galaxies with lower @xmath0 ( e.g. , g10 ; kruijssen 2012 ; kruijssen & bastian 2016 ) .",
    "two independent observational methods have been developed to test this : the cmf / sfr statistic ( chandar , fall , & whitmore 2015 ; hereafter cfw15 ) and @xmath9 , the fraction of stars formed in bound clusters ( bastian et al .",
    "a third , less direct method , @xmath21 , has also been used ( larsen & richtler 2000 ) . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the first two methods , because they are easier to interpret . in this section ,",
    "we apply both methods to our cluster sample in ngc 3256 , and compare the results with those from previous works and for different galaxies .",
    "cfw15 compared the cmfs between several different galaxies by normalizing them by the sfr of the host galaxy , and comparing the amplitudes of the resulting cmf / sfr statistic .",
    "the sample included spirals ( m83 and m51 ) , irregulars and starbursts ( large and small magellanic clouds , ngc 4214 , and ngc 4449 ) , and the merging antennae galaxies .",
    "the large range of amplitudes for the cmfs in two different ranges of age ( log@xmath105 and @xmath114 log@xmath121 ) in these galaxies collapse when divided by their respective sfrs .",
    "the dispersion in the cmf / sfr statistic is only @xmath141 , similar to the expected uncertainties .",
    "since the cmf / sfr statistic of very young clusters is similar across these different galaxies , cfw15 concluded that cluster formation scales with the overall sfr on galaxy scales .",
    "the similarity of the cmf / sfr statistic for the older clusters suggests that the disruption histories are also similar across the galaxies .    here",
    ", we determine the cmf / sfr statistic for ngc 3256 for the first time and compare with the rest of the galaxies in the cfw15 sample .",
    "the mass functions discussed in section [ mf ] were shown to follow a power law with index @xmath103 . in the left panel of figure [ dndlogm ]",
    ", we show the unnormalized cmfs for the same seven galaxies shown in cfw15 and now also include ngc 3256 .",
    "the cmf for ngc 3256 is higher than that of the other galaxies , including the antennae .",
    "the right panel of figure [ dndlogm ] presents the cmf / sfr statistic for ngc 3256 and shows that it is similar to that of the other seven galaxies .",
    "we measure the cmf / sfr statistic only for clusters younger than log@xmath105 , because our ngc 3256 sample does not contain a significant number of clusters older than this .",
    "the uncertainties in the cmf / sfr statistic can be separated into uncertainties in the cmf and in the sfr value . here",
    "we focus on the latter and refer the reader to section [ mf_err ] , where we discussed uncertainties regarding the mass function .",
    "we adopt a total sfr of 50 @xmath18 yr@xmath142 for ngc 3256 ( sakamoto et al .",
    "2014 ) , which was calculated from the bolometric infrared luminosity .",
    "this sfr is quite similar to the value of 46 @xmath18 yr@xmath142 calculated from the total infrared luminosity and adopted in g10 for the sfr .",
    "we find other modern calculations of the sfr in ngc 3256 in a similar range , with a high value of 85 @xmath18 yr@xmath142 using infrared luminosity ( rodrguez - zaurn et al .",
    "these values are consistent with an accuracy to within a factor of about two for the sfr , as found by several previous works ( e.g. , lee et al .",
    "2009 ; cfw15 ) .",
    "while our full area of coverage is @xmath143 kpc@xmath47 , the clusters fall within an area of @xmath144 kpc@xmath145 , comparable to that used for the sfr determinations mentioned above . while it is important that the same area of the galaxy be used for determining both the cmf and the sfr ( as done in cfw15 ) , this has not always been done .",
    "a number of studies have compared cluster properties with the sfr density of the host galaxy , but with the latter determined for a different area than for the clusters . for ngc 3256",
    ", g10 assumed a star - forming area of @xmath146 kpc@xmath47 ( taken from the literature ) , but the actual area covered by their cluster catalog is only @xmath147 kpc@xmath47 ( see section [ clus_sel ] and figure [ image ] ) .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in previously published values of the star - forming _ area _ to be approximately a factor of two for ngc 3256 .",
    "this is on top of the uncertainty in the sfr itself .",
    "cfw15 quantify the scatter in the cmf / sfr statistic among galaxies by fitting each galaxy by    @xmath148    and find the scatter in the normalization coefficient @xmath149 to be @xmath150log @xmath151 .",
    "when ngc 3256 is added as an eighth galaxy , we find @xmath150log @xmath152 .",
    "if the formation of clusters is affected by the overall sfr or @xmath0 of their host galaxy , we should see a correlation of these properties with the residuals of log @xmath149 . in figure [ residuals",
    "] , we plot the residuals of log @xmath149 for each galaxy versus the sfr and @xmath0 .",
    "we take @xmath0 values for all galaxies ( including ngc 3256 ) , but not the antennae , from the recent compilation made by adamo et al .",
    "the result for ngc 3256 is shown in red .",
    "the left panel is similar to the upper - left panel of figure 4 in cfw15 , who did not show the residuals with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "no obvious trend in the residuals is observed with either the sfr or with @xmath0 .",
    "the nonparametric spearman correlation coefficient , @xmath153 , and the corresponding probability @xmath154 confirm this visual impression .",
    "we find @xmath153 of -0.07 and @xmath154 of 0.87 for log @xmath149 versus sfr and @xmath153 of -0.24 and @xmath154 of 0.57 for log @xmath149 versus @xmath0 .",
    "these @xmath154 values should be less than 0.05 to have a greater than 95% confidence of there being a correlation .",
    "therefore , there is no statistically significant correlation between the residuals in log @xmath149 and sfr and @xmath0 for these eight galaxies .",
    "our results for ngc 3256 , when added to those for the seven galaxies presented in cfw15 , are consistent with the hypothesis that the formation rates of stars and clusters are similar across star - forming galaxies that span a large range ( approximately three orders of magnitude ) in sfr and @xmath0 .",
    "our results for the age distribution in ngc 3256 , which also shows a declining shape similar to that in the other more quiescent galaxies , suggest that the disruption history may also be the same , although this conclusion depends on the ( currently unknown ) sfh of the system .",
    "the cluster population models presented in whitmore , chandar , & fall ( 2007 ) indicate that for cluster disruption that is mostly independent of mass , the youngest clusters are the brightest .",
    "this is consistent with our findings for ngc 3256 in section [ ha_calib ] .",
    "a second , similar statistic that has been widely used in the literature is @xmath9 , defined as the mass formed in bound clusters divided by the total stellar mass .",
    "the total mass in clusters , within a given age range , is typically found by extrapolating the observed cmf down to a mass of 100 @xmath18 .",
    "this extrapolation is accomplished either by assuming a power law or schechter function , or by using a simulated cluster population .",
    "@xmath9 has been estimated for a number of galaxies and is typically plotted against @xmath155 of the host galaxy .",
    "previously , both observational and theoretical works have suggested that there is a strong correlation between @xmath9 and @xmath0 ( and @xmath21 and @xmath0 ) , such that the higher the @xmath0 of a galaxy , the higher the fraction of stars formed in bound clusters .",
    "since estimates of @xmath0 and sfr correlate strongly for the specific galaxies studied thus far , there should be a similarly strong correlation between @xmath9 and sfr .",
    "if confirmed , this result would differ from the result of cfw15 who found little variation from galaxy to galaxy for cmf / sfr .",
    "g10 estimated @xmath9 for ngc 3256 , and found @xmath156 .",
    "this was calculated from the cfr divided by the sfr , and it included only clusters with log(@xmath157 . we summarize their method below , and refer the reader to g10 for details .",
    "g10 found the total mass in clusters above a cutoff of log@xmath158 and used a synthetic cluster population to find the fraction of mass contained in clusters that is below this cutoff , assuming a power law mass function with slope @xmath159 .",
    "they obtained the cfr by dividing their total mass in clusters by 7 myr , rather than 10 myr , due to the expectation that the clusters are embedded for the first 3 myr and hence are missing from the sample .",
    "they divided the cfr by the sfr and obtained @xmath160 .",
    "they made three additional corrections , each increasing @xmath9 by @xmath161% , giving a final value of @xmath162 .",
    "g10 made these corrections in order to account for : ( 1 ) their rejection of clusters with poor fits and photometry , ( 2 ) a range of metallicities for young clusters in ngc 3256 , which g10 found would increase the total cluster mass relative to their assumptions , and ( 3 ) an underestimate in actual cluster masses relative to derived masses .",
    "we follow the g10 method , for the most part , to estimate @xmath9 from our larger cluster catalog in ngc 3256 .",
    "we find the total mass in clusters above log@xmath163 and younger than 10 myr to be @xmath164 .",
    "we use a similar synthetic cluster population as g10 to calculate the fraction of mass contained in clusters for @xmath165 .",
    "we arrive at a cfr of 16.7 @xmath18 yr@xmath142 by dividing @xmath166 by 7 myr , and we calculate @xmath167 cfr / sfr @xmath168 , when we assume an sfr of 50 @xmath18 yr@xmath142 .",
    "we do not make the three 25% corrections in our determination of @xmath9 , because our procedure does not result in the rejection of clusters with poor fits , we do not find any direct information on the metallicity distribution of young clusters in ngc 3256 , and we are using different ssp models that , as far as we know , do not systematically underestimate cluster masses .",
    "our @xmath9 value of 0.33 is @xmath169 times higher than the value of 0.12 obtained by g10 before they make the additional corrections described above .",
    "this factor is the same as the relative offset in the masses that we found in section [ mf ] .",
    "our results suggest that @xmath9 is fairly robust when the same set of assumptions are used .",
    "ideally , @xmath9 should be determined using the same set of assumptions for all galaxies . however ,",
    "this is not the current state of @xmath9 estimates in the literature , where different sets of assumptions have been used for different galaxies . for completeness , in table [ gammas ]",
    ", we compile different estimates of @xmath9 for ngc 3256 using different sets of assumptions . here , column 4 shows our ` best ' estimates of @xmath9 , while column 5 includes the three 25% corrections used by g10 ( labeled as @xmath170 ) .",
    "we find that one of the biggest sources of uncertainty is the exact value used for the power law index of the cmf , @xmath103 .",
    "g10 and other works have found that @xmath103 has typical uncertainties of the order of @xmath171 .",
    "however , changes at this level have a strong impact and change the derived value of @xmath9 by a factor of nearly four .",
    "@xmath9 is also sensitive to both the lower and upper mass ranges assumed in the extrapolation .",
    "if @xmath159 , then each decade in mass adds an equal percentage of total mass .",
    "for example , extrapolating down to a lower mass cutoff of , say , @xmath172 rather than @xmath173 would increase the fraction of @xmath165 by @xmath174 .",
    "the estimates of @xmath9 vary from 0.09 to 0.98 ( i.e. , a factor of approximately 10 ! ) , depending on the specific choice of parameters .",
    "if we apply the same three 25% corrections as used by g10 , we find a range between 0.18 and 1.91 , i.e. the estimates go higher than 100% .",
    "as also found by g10 , the exact value of @xmath9 is quite sensitive to the specific assumptions and extrapolations that are made . because a variety of assumptions have been made for determinations of @xmath9 in different galaxies ( which we will address in a forthcoming paper ) , and because this method requires more assumptions than the cmf / sfr statistic , the current determinations have larger uncertainties , which may make it more difficult to compare results between galaxies .",
    "we have used acs / wfc from _ hst _ to measure the properties of star clusters in the main body of ngc 3256 .",
    "we draw the following conclusions .    1 .",
    "the lf follows a power law with index @xmath175 where @xmath49 for the sample combining inner ( with @xmath49 ) and outer ( with @xmath176 ) regions of ngc 3256 .",
    "measuring @xmath26 for the inner and outer regions separately yielded @xmath78 .",
    "these values agree with previous work .",
    "we found that the age distribution can be described by a power law with index @xmath97 for independent mass ranges and for catalogs from the inner and outer areas of the galaxy separately .",
    "these values can be interpreted as a destruction rate of @xmath177 each decade in time and are consistent with typical values of @xmath178 found in other systems .",
    "the mass functions in various cluster age ranges are well described by a power law with index @xmath103 .",
    "young ( log@xmath105 ) clusters follow a robust @xmath179 .",

    ", we artificially degraded an image of the antennae and created independent catalogs from the degraded and original images . while less than half of the image - smoothed sources were detected in the original image , the lfs , color distributions , and age distributions produced from both catalogs were very similar .",
