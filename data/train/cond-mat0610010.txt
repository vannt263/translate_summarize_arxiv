    "although there is a large volume of literature devoted to the effects of quenched disorder , there has been relatively little study on how it influences the behavior of systems whose pure versions undergo a first - order phase transition .",
    "this question was first addressed by imry and wortis @xcite who showed that inhomogeneities may cause local variations of the transition temperature inside the sample .",
    "provided that the cost in interface energy is not great , bubbles of the  wrong \" phase are formed , eventually leading to a substantial rounding of the transition . a theorem due to aizenman and wehr @xcite shows that in less than two dimensions there can be no phase coexistence at the transition , and therefore no latent heat , in a system with quenched random impurities .",
    "therefore these systems are expected to always exhibit a continuous transition .",
    "the influence of quenched impurities coupling to the local energy density has been extensively studied by cardy @xcite .",
    "a mapping to the random field ising model , whose renormalization group flows are well known , addresses the question of what happens in higher than two dimensions where the aizenman - wehr theorem is not applicable .",
    "it was found that , depending on the specific values of parameters such as the laten heat and the surface tension , the phase transition can either be first or second order .",
    "more conclusive analytic results were obtained in an ising model with discrete order parameter @xcite .",
    "the pure system exhibits a fluctuation - driven first order transition , where the mean field theory predicts a continuous transition but fluctuation effects make it discontinuous . quenched randomness eventually drives the transition to become continuous in two dimensions , in accordance with the aizenman - wehr theorem , but this may or may not happen in higher dimensions .",
    "the majority of studies in this field are carried out for spin - glass or analogous systems , e.g. with a frustrated dipolar ordering @xcite . however , in such systems the experimental work is difficult and results are often indirect . in contrast , the quadrupolar orientational ordering of nematic liquid crystals offers the easy experimental access to thermodynamic and structural features of phase transitions . the classical work on frustrated nematic liquids by bellini et al .",
    "@xcite has generated a large interest in studies of liquid crystals in random environments , such as porous silica gel .",
    "one must appreciate , however , that the characteristic length scale of such disorder is much greater than the coherence length of the nematic order parameter and thus the theoretical concept of a continuous coarse - grained random field @xcite is difficult to sustain .",
    "quenched disorder is intrinsically present in nematic elastomers as a direct result of their synthesis @xcite .",
    "sources of disorder are introduced by crosslinking a liquid - crystalline polymer melt . in the simplest situation",
    ", the crosslinking takes place in the isotropic phase , in which case the local anisotropy axis of each crosslinking moiety is randomly oriented .",
    "once the polymer network is formed , the configuration of the crosslinks remains quenched , that is , it does not change with time and temperature .",
    "unless special precautions are taken during network fabrication , the low temperature ( ordered ) phase of nematic elastomers is always an equilibrium polydomain director texture @xcite .",
    "this is in marked contrast with a kinetic `` polydomain '' texture often referred to as schlieren texture @xcite , which is the consequence of nucleation and growth mismatch in a system undergoing the first - order transition @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium polydomain structure of nematic elastomers is reversible with changing temperature and is characterized by the uniform non - zero order parameter , but the highly non - uniform orientation of the principal axis of nematic director @xmath1 .",
    "correlations between directors decay rapidly and eventually vanish at distances much larger than @xmath2 , the correlation length or domain size .",
    "this is in agreement with the general result that quenched impurities destroy long - range order , first shown by larkin @xcite and then generalized by imry and ma @xcite .",
    "there is a full analogy with a corresponding dipolar system named `` random anisotropy magnets '' @xcite .",
    "in fact , all other ( e.g. smectic @xcite ) liquid crystal elastomers follow the same pattern of forming the equilibrium textures with a characteristic length scale often referred to as the domain size .",
    "this length scale in typical nematic elastomers is of the order of microns @xcite , therefore light passing through the sample is multiply scattered on birefringent domains with randomly oriented optical axis @xcite ( see @xcite for a brief review of experimental facts in this area ) . as a result such",
    "a sample is completely transparent at high temperatures , but becomes opaque below its nematic - to - isotropic transition temperature @xmath3 .",
    "it should be noted that the polydomain texture is the thermodynamically stable low - temperature phase .",
    "applying an adequately strong aligning stress @xcite or increasing the temperature above @xmath3 @xcite destroys the polydomain texture , by aligning the local axis of each domain , or removing the optical contrast between them .",
    "however , once the stress is removed ( or the temperature lowered ) , the elastomer returns to its previous state and the average domain size is found to be reversible during this stress ( or temperature ) cycling .",
    "experimental investigations in nematic elastomers support the theoretical ideas of a continuous nematic - isotropic transition , rather than the discontinuous first - order transition expected by the landau - de gennes mean field theory based on the symmetry of quadrupolar ordering in three dimensions .",
    "the fact that polydomain nematic textures are optically opaque creates a practical problem when attempting to experimentally determine the local order parameter @xmath0 of the mesogenic units .",
    "it is impossible to use birefringence , dichroism or xray measurements , the methods that have made this task simple in aligned liquid - crystal systems .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) provides perhaps the only opportunity of order detection , by tracking the bias in orientational motion of selected chemical bonds and providing a unique @xmath0-signature even in the orientationally averaged case .",
    "it was used to measure @xmath4 of both a nematic polymer melt and its corresponding crosslinks network @xcite .",
    "the addition of crosslinks was shown to make the nematic transition smooth , as well as to slightly reduce order .",
    "an indirect alternative to nmr comes from applying an external field to align the domains .",
    "birefringence can then be measured , as long as the system has passed the critical point of the polydomain - monodomain transition @xcite .",
    "the order parameter can thus be found for a series of decreasing applied fields .",
    "although the zero - stress limit is not accessible , it can be extrapolated from the comparison of the other curves and , again , a continuous phase transition is seen @xcite .",
    "the continuous transition is also found in carefully synthesized monodomain nematic elastomers , where a second stage of the crosslinking takes place when the sample is stressed @xcite .",
    "plots of the macroscopic order parameter @xmath4 , obtained through birefringence @xcite , x - ray scattering @xcite and nmr measurements @xcite , show the same behavior .",
    "there are two possible explanations for such a deviation from the basic symmetry - based expectation of a first - order transition .",
    "inhomogeneities may cause local variations of the transition temperature inside the sample and lead to a substantial rounding of the transition , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the other explanation considers stresses imprinted in the system during the second crosslinking stage , which add a @xmath5 term to the landau - de gennes expansion .",
    "obviously , for adequately large @xmath6 , the system would become supercritical and show a continuous transition .",
    "the analysis of the nmr spectra supports the supercritical scenario , although some degree of inhomogeneity was also found using the second moment of the spectra @xcite .",
    "another study of strain as a function of temperature over a range of applied tensile stress argues the opposite point @xcite .",
    "the blurring of the isotropic - nematic transition is attributed to the presence of heterogeneities , although the authors do not consider boundary effects that are bound to be present as discussed in @xcite .",
    "uchida @xcite has studied disordered polydomain nematic elastomers with emphasis on the role of nonlocal elastic interactions .",
    "he has shown that networks crosslinked in the isotropic phase lose their long - range orientational order due to the locally quenched random stresses , which were incorporated into the affine - deformation model of nematic rubber elasticity .",
    "simulation work was carried out to investigate the role of random bonds and random fields that might be present in elastomers @xcite , in both cases finding that the first - order isotropic - nematic transition to broaden into a smooth crossover . for random - field disorder ,",
    "the smooth crossover into an ordered state is also attributed to the long - range elastic interaction present in elastomers .",
    "a recent coarse - grained model for liquid - crystalline elastomers has also found that both homogeneous and inhomogeneous samples undergo a continuous isotropic - nematic transition @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we apply the traditional spin - glass techniques to investigate the characteristics of nematic phase transition in a system with quenched random anisotropy .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "@xmath7 we summarize a physical model of quenched disorder in nematic systems following @xcite , and introduce the replica hamiltonian .",
    "section  @xmath8 applies the auxiliary fields to incorporate several constraints into this problem and obtains the effective mean - field free energy of disorder in the system . in section",
    "@xmath9 we investigate the stability of replica symmetry and discover the limits where our solutions are valid .",
    "finally , in section  @xmath10 we obtain the final free energy renormalization in terms of the order parameter @xmath0 and disorder strength , and investigate the characteristics of the nematic phase transition in various situations .",
    "we conclude by discussing our results and comparing them with experiments .",
    "in the case of nematic elastomers crosslinked in the isotropic phase , the sources of quenched disorder are provided by the network crosslinks .",
    "almost independently of their specific chemical structure , the crosslinks contain anisotropic groups that locally provide easy anisotropy axes @xmath11 : it is favorable for the local director to align along @xmath11 in the vicinity of the crosslink because the anisotropic molecules in both the crosslinkers and in the nematic system interact , both sterically and via the long - range van de waals attraction .",
    "the local anisotropy axes of the crosslinks , as well as their distribution inside the sample , are quenched variables since the crosslinks can neither rotate nor move once the chemical synthesis of the elastomer is complete . although this has never been tested experimentally , there are two independent molecular models that estimate the energy of orientational confinement that a crosslink experiences from the surrounding network strands @xcite    we follow earlier work @xcite in modelling the local coupling of the nematic order and the random field applied by the crosslinks . for a crosslink positioned at @xmath12 , with an anisotropy axis @xmath13 , an energy @xmath14 is raised due to the interaction with the local nematic order parameter @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the coupling strength . employing a coarse - grained expression for the continuum density of crosslinks @xmath17 and substituting the full tensor expression for @xmath18",
    ", we get the random field energy : @xmath19 where the irrelevant constant @xmath20 has been dropped .",
    "although the random field energy is proposed specifically for a nematic elastomer , it is a general expression which is valid for all random - anisotropy systems with underlying quadrupolar symmetry .    to obtain the full hamiltonian describing the nematic ordering , the gradient elasticity penalizing the fluctuations of the director field",
    "must be also taken into account . in continuum",
    "elasticity the hamiltonian takes the form : @xmath21 \\,=\\,\\int { d^3 \\bm{r } \\left [ \\frac{k}{2}\\,\\left ( \\nabla \\bm{n}\\right)^2\\,-\\,\\gamma\\,q\\,\\rho \\left(\\bm{k } \\cdot \\bm{n } \\right)^2\\right ] } ,   \\label{hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the frank elastic constant in the one - constant approximation .",
    "a simple dimensional argument gives @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the nematic coherence length , below which the meanings of the director @xmath25 and order parameter @xmath0 are ill - defined @xcite .",
    "both microscopic and phenomenological theories of nematic - isotropic transition give the elastic constant @xmath22 to scale as @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "combining these two estimates , we take that for small @xmath0 the elastic constant is approximately given by @xmath28 .",
    "it is important to clarify that we are examining a homogeneous sample and as a result the magnitude of @xmath0 and the @xmath3 are uniform across the sample .",
    "there is a rich literature on the role inhomogeneities play in general first - order systems @xcite and more specifically in nematic elastomers @xcite .",
    "the important difference in our assumptions is that , although the director correlations in the polydomain nematic are short - range ( equilibrium spin - glass texture ) , the underlying nematic order parameter @xmath0 is homogeneous across the system .",
    "this assumption is based on the fact that the spin - glass like nematic textures are in fact homogeneous , in the sense that every element of the sample is equivalent to others : no ` domain walls ' ( unlike , for instance , during the stress - induced poly - monodomain transition @xcite when the domain walls localize ) .",
    "there are three established methods of dealing with quenched random fields in the replica method framework : one based on the functional renormalization group analysis , another using the gaussian variational method and the third using auxiliary fields .",
    "this paper employs the latter .",
    "we are interested in results that do not depend on the specific distributions of @xmath29 and @xmath11 because we can not control these distributions experimentally . in other words",
    "we are looking for the free energy averaged over the random distributions of the quenched variables @xmath29 and @xmath11 . crosslinking the sample above @xmath3",
    "makes the easy anisotropy axes point at random directions , with an isotropic probability of orientation @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , the crosslinks are dispersed randomly in the sample with density @xmath31 .",
    "the probability that a particular distribution @xmath29 occurs is gaussian : @xmath32\\,\\sim\\ , \\exp\\left[- \\int{d^3r \\frac{\\left [ \\rho(\\bm{r})- \\rho_0 \\right]^2}{2\\rho_0}}\\right ] , \\label{rho}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the mean density of crosslinks .",
    "it is not possible to directly average the logarithm of the partition function @xmath34 and obtain the exact free energy .",
    "so an alternative definition of a logarithm ( the limit : @xmath35 ) is used , allowing to perform the simpler average of the product @xmath36 .",
    "this way of dealing with quenched disorder is called the  replica trick \" , first introduced in the context of spin glasses by edwards and anderson @xcite . the expression for the free energy arising from disorder",

    "the aim of this work is to obtain @xmath39 as a function of the order parameter @xmath0 and add it to the landau - de gennes free energy to see how it influences the phase transition .",
    "a rough sketch of the averaging over disorder is given below .",
    "the density average over @xmath40 yields a random field term @xmath41,\\ ] ] where ( here and throughout this paper ) @xmath42 . the reader s attention is drawn to the appearance of a second replica index @xmath43 due to the square of the @xmath44 .",
    "since the distribution of the orientations of the easy axes @xmath45 is assumed fully isotropic , symmetry arguments show that the average @xmath46 is proportional to @xmath47 .",
    "the constant of proportionality is equal to @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the dimensionality of the unit vector @xmath11 .",
    "therefore @xmath50 since @xmath51 higher terms of the taylor expansion are smaller than the lowest order term ( @xmath52 ) and are subsequently dropped in the last line of eq .",
    "( [ kaverage ] ) .",
    "this approximate treatment retains a random field term which is overall fourth order in @xmath53 , as it was before the @xmath54-averaging , and it is most frequently met , and used , in molecular theories involving rotational diffusion .    the second line of eq .",
    "( [ replicatrick ] ) is obtained after averaging over quenched disorder , sketched above , and provides the definition of the `` replica hamiltonian '' , which no longer depends on the quenched distributions of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , but instead couples different replicas of the system : @xmath57\\equiv\\sum_{a , b=1}^m \\int d^3 \\bm{r } \\bigg\\ { \\frac{k}{2}\\,\\left ( \\nabla \\bm{n}_a\\right)^2\\delta_{ab}+ \\nonumber\\\\-\\,\\frac{\\gamma}{2 } \\left[2\\left(\\bm{n}_a \\cdot \\bm{n}_b \\right)^2\\,+\\,(\\bm{n}_a \\cdot \\bm{n}_a)\\ , ( \\bm{n}_b \\cdot \\bm{n}_b)\\right ] \\bigg\\ } , \\label{replicahamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where subscripts @xmath24 and @xmath43 are the replica indexes and @xmath38 is the number of replicas that will be set to zero at the end of the calculation .",

    "we drop this term and keep the relevant contribution @xmath64 that describes the coupling between different replicas .",
    "care must be taken to ensure that the director @xmath65 remains a unit vector .",

    "we proceed with a mean - field treatment of the auxiliary fields where a constant value for @xmath67 is assumed , independent of spacial coordinates .",

    "the discontinuous jump of the order parameter at the nematic transition becomes smaller as the strength of the disorder @xmath238 increases and eventually disappears altogether above a critical value making the phase transition continuous .",

    "once this temperature is passed ( @xmath245 ) the low-@xmath0 minimum determines the system s order parameter .",
    "the crucial difference between these plots and the classical landau - de gennes theory is that the low-@xmath0 minimum in the latter is always placed at @xmath246 .",
