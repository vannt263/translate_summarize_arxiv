    "suppose that we observe equispaced samples ( at the nyquist sampling rate ) of a number of @xmath6 sinusoidal signals : denoted by matrix @xmath7 , on the index set @xmath8 , where @xmath2 is the number of equispaced samples per sinusoidal signal , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "that is , we have @xmath6 measurement vectors corresponding to the @xmath6 columns of @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 indexes the entries of @xmath11 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 $ ] denotes the @xmath15th normalized frequency ( the starting point 0 and the ending point 1 are identical ) , @xmath16 is the ( complex ) amplitude of the @xmath15th frequency component composing the @xmath17th sinusoidal signal , and @xmath5 is the number of the components which is unknown but typically small .",
    "moreover , we let @xmath18 be the sample size of each measurement vector .",
    "following from the literature of spectral analysis @xcite , the observed data @xmath19 are called complete if @xmath20 ( i.e. , @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) and incomplete otherwise . in the latter case , the unobserved data on the complementary index set @xmath23 , @xmath24 , are called missing data .",
    "let @xmath25 denote the set of the frequencies .",
    "the problem concerned in this paper is to recover @xmath26 given the observed data , which is referred to as the problem of joint sparse frequency recovery in the sense that the multiple measurement vectors ( mmvs ) ( i.e. , the @xmath6 columns of @xmath27 ) share the same @xmath5 frequencies .",
    "after @xmath26 is obtained , the amplitudes @xmath28 and the missing data can be easily obtained by a simple least - squares method .    in the single measurement vector ( smv )",
    "case where @xmath29 , this frequency recovery problem is known as line spectral estimation and has wide applications in communications , radar , sonar , seismology , astronomy and so on @xcite . with complete data",
    ", prony s method can recover the frequencies once @xmath30 by root - finding regardless of the values of the frequencies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , it does not work in the presence of missing data and is sensitive to measurement noise . with the development of sparse signal representation and later the compressed sensing ( cs ) concept @xcite , which studies the recovery of a sparse signal from a number of linear measurements much less than its ambient dimension ,",
    "sparse methods for frequency recovery have been popular in the past decade .",
    "but unfortunately , the frequencies of interest are usually assumed to lie on a fixed grid of the frequency domain @xmath31 because the development of cs so far has been focused on signals that can be sparsely represented under a finite discrete dictionary . under the aforementioned assumption the observation model ( [ formu : observmodel1 ] )",
    "can be written into an underdetermined system of linear equations and then sparse methods are applied to solve the sparse signal involved whose support corresponds to the frequency set @xmath26 .",
    "typical sparse methods include combinatorial optimization or @xmath0 ( pseudo-)norm minimization , its convex relaxation or @xmath1 norm minimization , and greed methods such as orthogonal matching pursuit ( omp ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 minimization has the best theoretical guarantee , typically ensuring exact recovery once @xmath32 , however , it is np - hard and can not be practically solved . in conventional wisdom ,",
    "the maximal @xmath5 allowed in the @xmath1 minimization and omp for guaranteed exact recovery is inversely proportional to a metric called coherence which , however , increases dramatically as the grid gets fine . on the other hand , due to the grid selection",
    ", basis mismatches become a major problem of cs - based methods and many modifications have been proposed to alleviate this drawback ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . a breakthrough came up recently .",
    "cands and fernandez - granda @xcite deal directly with the continuous frequency recovery problem and therefore completely eliminate the basis mismatches . in particular",
    ", they consider the complete data case and show that the frequencies can be exactly recovered via convex optimization once any two frequencies are separate by at least @xmath3 .",
    "that means , up to @xmath33 frequencies can be recovered within a polynomial time under the frequency separation condition .",
    "the convex optimization is based on the so - called total variation norm or atomic norm which extends the @xmath1 norm to the continuous frequency setting and is formulated as semidefinite programming ( sdp ) @xcite .",
    "inspired by @xcite , tang _",
    "_ @xcite study the problem of continuous frequency recovery from partial observations ( i.e. , incomplete data ) based on the atomic norm minimization . under the same frequency separation condition",
    ", they show that a number of @xmath34 randomly located measurements is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery with high probability .",
    "several subsequent works on this topic have been done and an incomplete list includes @xcite .    in the mmv case , an example at hand is direction of arrival ( doa ) estimation in array processing @xcite .",
    "in particular , suppose that @xmath5 farfield , narrowband sources impinge on an array of sensors and one wants to know their directions .",
    "the output of the sensor array can be modeled by ( [ formu : observmodel1 ] ) , where each frequency corresponds to one source direction .",
    "the sampling index set @xmath35 therein represents the geometry of the sensor array . to be specific",
    ", @xmath36 in the complete data case corresponds to an @xmath2-element uniform linear array ( ula ) while @xmath37 denotes a sparse linear array ( sla ) .",
    "each measurement vector is composed of the output of the sensor array at one snapshot , and the mmvs are obtained by taking measurements at multiple snapshots , where the source directions are assumed constant during the time window .",
    "music @xcite is prominent for this joint sparse frequency recovery problem , however , it is sensitive to correlations of the sources and requires a sufficient number of snapshots such that the sample variance can capture the whole signal subspace . in lieu of sparse methods in the smv case ,",
    "joint sparse recovery techniques have been widely studied in the mmv case which , besides the sparse property , exploit the prior knowledge that the mmvs share the same sparsity profile , known as joint sparsity @xcite .",
    "it has been vastly reported that the performance of joint sparse recovery can be generally improved by increasing the number of measurement vectors .",
    "theoretical results include @xcite on the @xmath38 norm under a mild condition , and @xcite on greed methods and @xcite on the @xmath1 norm under the assumption that the joint sparse signals are randomly drawn , in particular , the rows of the source signals @xmath39 in ( [ formu : observmodel1 ] ) are at general positions .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the theoretical guarantee of any joint sparse recovery technique can not be improved without additional assumptions of the sparse signals of interest . to see this ,",
    "suppose that all the columns of @xmath40 are identical up to some scale factors ( any two sources / rows of @xmath40 are identical up to a scale factor as well and usually said to be coherent in array processing ) and therefore , the mmvs are simply scaled replica of a smv and do not provide additional information for the recovery . in this respect , the results of @xcite and @xcite are referred to as the _ average case _ analysis while those accounting for the aforementioned extreme case are called _ worst case _ analysis . similarly to the smv case , the joint sparse recovery methods rely on discretization / gridding of the frequency domain and suffer from basis mismatches .",
    "unlike the smv case in which the continuous frequency recovery methods have been recently studied , results are rare on the joint sparse frequency recovery concerned in this paper . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the only known discretization - free / gridless method is introduced in our previous work @xcite based on a statistical perspective and utilizing a weighted covariance fitting ( wcf ) criterion in @xcite . in the main context of this paper",
    "we will show that this wcf technique is related to the mmv atomic norm method to be proposed in this paper .    in this paper",
    ", we present optimization methods for joint sparse frequency recovery and theoretically analyze their performances in the noiseless setting .",
    "we firstly consider a continuous @xmath0 norm formulation , referred to as the atomic @xmath0 norm , and present its theoretical guarantees for exact frequency recovery , which extends the conventional discrete problem formulation , concept and result to the continuous setting .",
    "we next consider its convex relaxation , referred to as the ( mmv ) atomic norm , and investigate its theoretical guarantees with complete and incomplete data separately .",
    "in particular , given the complete data we prove that the frequencies can be exactly recovered by solving a convex optimization problem once they are separate by at least @xmath3 . under the same frequency separation condition ,",
    "a number of @xmath4 randomly located samples per measurement vector is sufficient to guarantee that the frequencies and the missing data can be exactly recovered with high probability by solving an atomic norm minimization problem . as a result , our analysis with the atomic norm extends the results of @xcite to the mmv case .",
    "since no or very mild assumptions are made for the source signals in our analysis , the _ worst case _",
    "theoretical guarantees above do not improve as the number of measurement vectors increases . moreover , we formulate the atomic @xmath0 norm and the atomic norm problems as rank minimization and sdp , respectively .",
    "extensive numerical simulations are carried out which validate our theoretical results and further demonstrate that the frequency separation condition required for exact recovery can be relaxed in general as the number of measurement vectors increases but can not in the worst case .",

    "<S> frequency recovery / estimation from samples of superimposed sinusoidal signals is a classical problem in statistical signal processing . </S>",
    "<S> its research has been recently advanced by atomic norm techniques which deal with continuous - valued frequencies and completely eliminate basis mismatches of existing compressed sensing methods . </S>",
    "<S> this work investigates the frequency recovery problem in the presence of multiple measurement vectors ( mmvs ) which share the same frequency components , termed as joint sparse frequency recovery and arising naturally from array processing applications . @xmath0- and @xmath1-norm - like formulations , referred to as atomic @xmath0 norm and the atomic norm , </S>",
    "<S> are proposed to recover the frequencies and cast as ( nonconvex ) rank minimization and ( convex ) semidefinite programming , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> their guarantees for exact recovery are theoretically analyzed which extend existing results with a single measurement vector ( smv ) to the mmv case and meanwhile generalize the existing joint sparse compressed sensing framework to the continuous dictionary setting . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , given a set of @xmath2 regularly spaced samples per measurement vector it is shown that the frequencies can be exactly recovered via solving a convex optimization problem once they are separate by at least ( approximately ) @xmath3 . under the same frequency separation condition , a random subset of @xmath2 regularly spaced samples of size @xmath4 per measurement vector is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery of the @xmath5 frequencies and missing samples with high probability via similar convex optimization . </S>",
    "<S> extensive numerical simulations are provided to validate our analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method .    </S>",
