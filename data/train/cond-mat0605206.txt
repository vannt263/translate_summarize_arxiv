    "matter  wave bright solitons of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a quasi - one dimensional ( 1d ) trapping potential have been realized by the ens group  @xcite and the rice group  @xcite .",
    "the stability of this self - trapped state is achieved by the balance between the attractive interatomic interaction and the quantum kinetic pressure . in 1d ,",
    "the bright soliton is stable and robust against noise . in 2d and 3d ,",
    "however , the balance between the attractive interaction and the kinetic pressure is precarious , and infinitesimal deviations from the stationary state cause a collapse or expansion of the system .",
    "while self - trapped liquids , such as a raindrop , are quite common , a self - trapped gas is a novel state of matter .",
    "such a stable self - trapped state in a gaseous bec in 2d or 3d , if it can be realized , might be referred to as a matter - wave droplet or simply a bec droplet .    a scheme proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite to stabilize a bec droplet is to oscillate the interatomic interaction rapidly using feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "the rapid oscillation of the interaction produces an effective potential that prevents the condensate from collapsing .",
    "this phenomenon is similar to the stabilization of an inverted pendulum by an oscillating pivot  @xcite .",
    "several researchers have demonstrated the stabilization of a bec droplet in 2d with oscillating interactions by numerically solving the gross  pitaevskii ( gp ) equation  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that this stabilization in 2d is also possible for a multicomponent bec .",

    "@xcite have predicted 3d breather solitons confined in a 1d lattice .",
    "however , in 3d free space , it appears that an oscillating interaction alone can not stabilize a bec droplet due to dynamical instabilities  @xcite . by taking into account the effect of energy dissipation , which always exists in realistic situations",
    ", we have shown that a bec droplet with oscillating interactions can be stabilized in 3d  @xcite .    in the present paper , we show that a bec droplet in 3d free space can be stabilized by feedback control of the interaction through nondestructive measurement of the condensate s peak column density .",
    "real - time monitoring of the density profile of a condensate is possible by using a nondestructive in - situ imaging method  @xcite .",
    "the collapse or expansion of the condensate can be prevented by a decrease or increase , respectively , in the strength of the attractive interaction if the peak density of the condensate increases above or decreases below a prescribed value .",
    "thus , the shape of the bec droplet can be maintained without collapse or expansion by negative feedback from the result of the real - time measurement .",
    "we will also examine the effect of experimental imperfections in the real - time measurement , such as spatial and time resolutions and experimental errors , and show that the stabilized bec droplet is robust against these imperfections .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ s : gp ] discusses the stationary solutions of the gp equations in 1d , 2d , and 3d free space .",
    "section  [ s : result ] numerically investigates the dynamics of the condensate under feedback control , and shows that a bec droplet in 3d can be stabilized for a wide range of parameters .",
    "section  [ s : var ] presents variational analysis using a gaussian trial function .",

    "when the external potential is given by @xmath7 and @xmath8 is much larger than the other characteristic energies , the degrees of freedom of the bec in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 directions are frozen and the system behaves as an effective 1d system . writing the wave function as @xmath11 and integrating eq .",
