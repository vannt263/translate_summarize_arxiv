    "the web has become a global tool for sharing information .",
    "it can be represented as a huge graph which consists of billions of hypertext web pages connected by hyperlinks pointing from one web page to another  @xcite .",
    "each web page is part of a larger web site , which is loosely defined as a group of web pages whose url addresses use the same domain name , such as cs.ucl.ac.uk and ieee.org .    studying and understanding the web s topological structure is important as it may lead to improved techniques for information retrieval .",
    "link structure of the web has been used in algorithms like pagerank  @xcite and hits  @xcite to estimate the importance of web pages , and in @xcite for community discovery and clustering .",
    "these algorithms do not typically use the internal link structure within a web site , but rather , rely on external links between web sites . nevertheless , the internal structure of a web site is important .",
    "for example the statistical property of web site link structure may be used as an informative measure of web site quality , e.g.  navigability  @xcite .",
    "there is surprisingly little study of the structural properties of web sites in general .",
    "certainly , it is well known that examination of the graph structure of an individual web site can be used to calculate the mean diameter of the web site , and other metrics , that can then be used to infer properties regarding the navigability of the web site .",
    "however , we are unaware of prior work that provides a _ statistical _ topological characterization of all web sites . as such , web sites , as opposed to the web , are often considered to exhibit an arbitrary statistical topological structure .",
    "however , this study reveals that the topology of web sites is not arbitrary .",
    "in fact , examination of the triangle coefficient ( the number of triangles of a node ) as a function of degree ( the number of links of the node ) reveals a very strong correlation across web sites , suggestive of a possible invariant of web site link structure .",
    "moreover , this third - order property varies across other networks , such as the web , the internet and citation networks .",
    "thus , it appears to strongly characterise web sites .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : defs ] we introduce a number of topological metrics which have been used to characterise and compare network structures . in section",
    "[ sec : data ] we introduce the datasets used in this study .",
    "these consist of 18 web sites which vary in size from a few thousand pages to millions of pages .",
    "the web sites cover a broad range of entities : 9 government sites from various countries , 3 commercial sites , 3 educational sites and 3 very large sites , ( ieee , wikipedia , yahoo ! ) . in section  [ sec : result ] we present our statistical results and discuss the implications .",
    "in addition to comparing data across web sites , we also compare with ( i ) subsets of the web , ( ii ) a citation network , ( iii ) the as - level internet network , and ( iv ) the generative model of barabsi and albert  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : conc ] summarises the key results and discusses how this work can be used to improve generative models of hypertext networks .",
    "we briefly review and define the following topological properties , which are grouped into three orders according to the scope of information required to compute them  @xcite .",
    "these are ( i ) the @xmath0-order properties , e.g. degree distribution , ( ii ) the @xmath1-order properties , e.g. degree correlation and rich - club connectivity , and ( iii ) the @xmath2-order properties , e.g. triangle coefficient and clustering coefficient .",
    "the link structure of a web site can be described as an undirected graph on which a node represents a web page and a link denotes the existence of at least one hyperlink connection between two nodes .",
    "the connectivity , or degree @xmath3 , of a node is defined as the number of links , or neighbours , the node has .",
    "for example in figure  1a , node @xmath4 has four neighbours @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and its degree @xmath9 .",
    "a web site can also be described as a directed graph on which each link has a direction pointing from one node to another .",
    "the in - degree @xmath10 of a node is then defined as the number of incoming links and the out - degree @xmath11 the number of outgoing links .",
    "for example in figure  1b , node @xmath4 has three incoming links from nodes @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath8 , i.e.  @xmath12 , and two outgoing links to nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 , i.e.  @xmath13 .",
    "this paper studies web sites link structure as undirected graphs unless specifically stated .",
    "the degree of a node measures a node s local connectivity .",
    "topological properties calculated by using the degree of individual nodes are classified as @xmath0-order properties , e.g.  the average degree @xmath14 of nodes in a network .",
    "the most studied topological property for large networks is the degree distribution @xmath15 , which is defined as the probability that a randomly selected node has degree @xmath3 .",
    "a random graph  @xcite is characterised by a poisson degree distribution where the distribution peaks at the network s average degree .",
    "it has been reported that a number of networks  @xcite follow a power - law degree distribution , @xmath16 this means that most nodes have very few links , while a few nodes have a very large number of links .",
    "topological properties are classified as @xmath1-order properties if they are based on the degree information of the two end nodes of a link , such as the joint degree distribution @xmath17  @xcite , which is the probability that a randomly selected link connects a node of degree @xmath3 with a node of degree @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath1-order properties provide a more complete description of a network s structure than the @xmath0-order properties .",
    "for example the degree distribution can be obtained from the joint degree distribution : @xmath19 .",
    "the nearest - neighbours average degree , @xmath20 , of @xmath3-degree nodes  @xcite , is a projection of the joint degree distribution , given by @xmath21 a network is called an assortative network if @xmath22 increases with @xmath3 , which means nodes tend to attach to similar nodes , i.e.  high  degree nodes to high  degree nodes and low  degree nodes to low  degree nodes ( ` assortative mixing ' ) .",
    "many social networks are assortative networks .",
    "a network is a disassortative network if @xmath22 decreases with @xmath3 , i.e.  high  degree nodes tend to connect with low  degree nodes and vice versa ( ` disassortative mixing ' ) .",
    "this is the case for most information and communications networks .",
    "a network s degree correlation , or mixing pattern , can be summarised by a single scalar called the assortative coefficient  @xcite , @xmath23 ^ 2 \\over l^{-1}\\sum_i{1\\over2}(s_i^2+d_i^2)-[l^{-1}\\sum_i{1\\over2}(s_i+d_i)]^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the number of links and @xmath25 , @xmath26 are degrees of the end nodes of the @xmath27th link with @xmath28 .",
    "the value of @xmath29 is in the range of @xmath30 $ ] . for assortative networks @xmath31 and for disassortative networks",
    "@xmath32 .      the rich - club connectivity  @xcite measures how tightly the high - degree nodes , _ rich _ nodes , interconnect with themselves . if @xmath33 is the number of nodes with degrees large than @xmath3 and they share @xmath34 links between themselves , the rich - club connectivity is defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the maximum possible number of links that the @xmath33 nodes can have . for example in figure  1a , there are five nodes ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) with degrees larger than 2 and they have 8 links between them , thus @xmath37 , which means the 5 best - connected nodes are 80% fully interconnected .",
    "the rich  club connectivity is a @xmath1-order property because whether a link belongs to @xmath34 depends on the degrees of the link s two end nodes .",
    "the rich  club connectivity is a different projection of the joint degree distribution , @xmath38\\cdot[n \\sum_{k'=k+1}^{k_{max}}p(k')-1]},\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the total number of nodes and @xmath40 is the maximum degree in a network .",
    "the rich  club connectivity does not trivially relate with the degree correlation  @xcite .",
    "for example the two graphs shown in figure  2 are both disassortative networks , but for the 3 best - connected nodes in figure  2a , @xmath41 , and in figure  2b , @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath2-order properties are based on connectivity information between three nodes that form a triangle .",
    "the triangle coefficient @xmath43 is defined as the number of triangles a node shares , which is equivalent to the number of links among the node s neighbours  @xcite .",
    "triangle is the basic unit for network redundancy .",
    "the more triangles , the more alternative paths between nodes .    [",
    "[ in - triangle - and - out - triangle - coefficients ] ] in - triangle and out - triangle coefficients + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    on a directed graph , a node s neighbours can be divided into two groups : in - neighbours , which are connected with incoming links ; and out - neighbours , which are connected with outgoing links .",
    "an in - triangle of a node consists of the node and two of its in - neighbours , and an out - triangle consists of the node and two out - neighbours .",
    "for example in figure  1b , node @xmath4 has two in - triangles @xmath44 and @xmath45 and one out - triangle @xmath46 , therefore node @xmath4 s in - triangle coefficient @xmath47 is 2 and out - triangle coefficient @xmath48 is 1 .",
    "a more widely studied @xmath2-order property is the clustering coefficient @xmath6 , which is defined as the ratio of actual links among a node s neighbours to the maximal possible number of links they can share  @xcite .",
    "the clustering coefficient of a node can be given as a function of a node s degree and its triangle coefficient , @xmath49 two nodes with different triangle coefficients can have the same clustering coefficient .",
    "for example in figure  1a , node @xmath5 has three neighbours and one triangle and node @xmath6 has six neighbours and five triangles ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) .",
    "however , their clustering coefficients are the same : @xmath55 therefore one should use the triangle coefficient to infer the clustering information of nodes with different degrees .",
    "here we briefly summarise the various datasets used in this study .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]      we exhaustively crawled the 18 web sites of the organisations listed in table 1 : 1 )  the national audit office or equivalent of canada ( ao - ca ) , italy ( ao - it ) , the united kingdom ( ao - uk ) and the united states ( ao - us ) ; 2 )  the foreign office or equivalent of australia ( fo - au ) , the czech republic ( fo - cz ) , german ( fo - de ) , japan ( fo - jp ) and the uk ( fo - uk ) ; 3 )  commercial web sites , such as hsbc bank in the uk ( com - hsbc ) , the uk retailer next ( com - next ) and the automobile company skoda ( com - skoda ) ; 4 )  educational web sites , such as the faculty of arts at the university of auckland , new zealand ( edu - auck ) , the haas school of business at the university of california at berkeley ( edu - ucb ) , and the department of computer science at university college london ( edu - ucl ) ; and 5 )  three very large web sites with millions of web pages , such as the ieee ( large - ieee ) , wikipedia in the language of simplified chinese ( large - wiki ) and yahoo ! ( large - yahoo ) .",
    "we used the nutch 1.6.0 crawler ( http://lucene.apache.org/nutch ) .",
    "each crawl was started from a web site s homepage and was restricted to the web site s domain as listed in table  1 .",
    "the crawler was configured to allow for complete site acquisition and collected all web pages up to a depth of 18 .",
    "the default parameters were a 5-second delay between requests to the same host , and 10,000 attempts to retrieve pages that fail with a ` soft ' error  @xcite .",
    "we discarded hyperlinks pointing to web pages outside the web site s domain and removed self - loops and duplicated hyperlinks .",
    "we are aware of a number of available data sources of the web .",
    "we did not extract web sites data from them because they aim to sample the entire web and contain very incomplete information of the internal link structure of individual web sites .",
    "for example the stanford webbase data ( http://dbpubs.stanford.edu:8091/~testbed/doc2/webbase ) contains only 400 web pages with nasa s domain name ( nasa.org ) .",
    "wt10 g is a mega dataset of the web proposed by the annual international text retrieval conference ( trecs , http://trec.nist.gov ) .",
    "wt10 g is constructed from more than 320 gigabytes of archived data containing 1.7 m web pages and hyperlinks between them .",
    "it is reported that wt10 g retains properties of the larger web  @xcite and has been used as a data resource for research on web retrieval and modelling .",
    "we randomly sampled 10 subsets of wt10 g , each of which contains 50,000 web pages and links between those pages . in this paper",
    "we use the average properties of the 10 wt10 g subsets as an approximation of the web s link structure .",
    "the citation network  @xcite data was extracted from the online computer science publication database citeseer ( http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/ ) .",
    "the citeseer data contain 575k entries , from which we extracted 244,864 records having at least one reference ( outgoing link ) or citation ( incoming link ) .",
    "the internet topology at the autonomous systems ( as ) level has been extensively studied in recent years  @xcite . on the as internet , nodes represent internet service providers and links represent connections between them . in this paper",
    "we use the as internet dataset itdk0304 collected by caida  @xcite .",
    "the barabsi and albert ( ba ) model  @xcite has been widely used in the study of complex networks .",
    "this model shows that a power - law degree distribution can be produced by two mechanisms : _ growth _ , where the network `` grows '' from a small random graph by attaching new nodes to old nodes in the existing system ; and _ preferential attachment _ , where a new node is attached preferentially to nodes that are already well connected .",
    "here we summarise our experimental findings .",
    "we examine a variety of first , second and third - order topological properties and compare them across the various web sites .",
    "we then compare the topological properties of web sites with other networks , specifically , the web , as network , a citation network , and the generative network of barabsi and albert .",
    "as shown in table  1 , the size and the average degree of the web sites vary significantly .",
    "the foreign office web sites have very large average degrees , whereas the three large web sites with millions of web pages have very small average degrees .",
    "figure  [ fig : websites]a , b  and  c illustrate the degree distribution @xmath15 , the degree correlation @xmath22 , and the rich - club connectivity @xmath56 of the 18 web sites on a log - log scale . also shown",
    "are their _ average _ properties , depicted by circles is obtained as such : for a given @xmath3 , if at least @xmath57 of the 18 web sites have @xmath58 , then @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "other average properties are calculated in similar ways . ] .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath0 and @xmath1-order properties of the web sites exhibit huge variations over several orders of magnitudes .",
    "thus , the web sites can not be well characterised by the average of these properties .",
    "for example , in figure  [ fig : websites]c , some web sites with nodes of degree @xmath61 are almost fully interconnected with themselves , i.e.  @xmath62 , whereas in other web sites the interconnectedness is much looser , with @xmath63 less than 0.001 .      figure  [ fig : websites]d shows the complementary cumulative distribution of the triangle coefficient @xmath64 , which is the probability that a node s triangle coefficient is larger than @xmath43 .",
    "figure  [ fig : websites]e shows the relationship between triangle coefficient and degree @xmath65 , i.e.  the average triangle coefficient of @xmath3-degree nodes . although the web sites do not show an agreement on @xmath64 , they do exhibit a clear correspondence on @xmath65 .",
    "some web sites have sharp spikes on their @xmath65 curves .",
    "these spikes reflect the existence of star - like subgraphs in these web sites , e.g.  a web page with a long list of hyperlinks pointing to documents or images . compared to the large number of web pages contained in a web site ,",
    "the limited number of such spikes are not statistically significant .",
    "the _ average _ over all the web sites of the triangle coefficient as a function of degree is also depicted in figure  [ fig : websites]e , see circles , and is a smooth curve , which well represents all the web sites .",
    "this is suggestive of a structural invariant of web sites .",
    "figure  [ fig : websites]f shows the web sites show a similar correspondence on the relationship between clustering coefficient and degree @xmath66 .",
    "note that the _ average _ clustering coefficient , depicted by circles , is not a monotonic function of degree .",
    "this is because the clustering coefficient is itself a function of the degree and triangle coefficient . in the following we",
    "do not consider @xmath66 further , as the triangle coefficient , @xmath65 , contains all information provided by @xmath66 .",
    "here we compare the topological properties of the _ average _ over all web sites , with those of other networks , specifically the web , a citation network , the as internet , and the ba model .",
    "figure  [ fig : networks]a shows that the degree distribution of the web , the citation network , the as internet and the ba model can be well described as a power - law @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "however the average degree distribution of the web sites is very different : for @xmath69 or @xmath70 , it can be described as a power - law ; but for @xmath71 , the distribution increases exponentially with degree .",
    "figure  [ fig : networks]b shows that the citation network and the as internet are typical disassortative networks where @xmath20 decreases monotonically with @xmath3 .",
    "the ba model is an example of a neutral network where @xmath20 does not change with @xmath3 . for the average of the web sites , and the web , @xmath20 first increases and then decreases with @xmath3 , and peaks at @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively . for large degrees ,",
    "the average @xmath20 of the web sites is significantly larger than all other networks .",
    "figure  [ fig : networks]c shows that the as internet has the highest rich - club connectivity , with a fully interconnected core , i.e. @xmath74 , for @xmath75 .",
    "the citation network has the lowest rich - club connectivity .",
    "although the ba model is very different from the web sites when measured by @xmath22 , the two exhibits similar rich - club connectivity for @xmath76 .",
    "figure  [ fig : networks]d shows that the web sites contain significantly more triangles than all other networks .",
    "the high density of triangles ensures the navigability of the web sites .",
    "figure  [ fig : networks]e shows that , in general , all the networks exhibit a positive correlation between triangle coefficient and degree .",
    "this is because the larger the degree of a node , the more neighbours a node has , and thus the higher the chance of forming triangles .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : thirdorder ] , all the web sites exhibit a very similar relationship between triangle coefficient and degree , that is well characterised by the average over all the web sites .",
    "the average correlation between triangle coefficient and degree of the web sites can be closely fitted by a function given as @xmath77 or @xmath78 it is clear that the relationship between triangle coefficient and degree is different from the other networks .",
    "the ba model exhibits the lowest number of triangles as a function of node degree , followed by the citation network , and then the as internet . for degree @xmath79",
    ", the web data closely follows that of the average over web sites , but diverges thereafter .      figure  [ fig : networks]f examines the three relationships of ( i ) triangle coefficient versus degree @xmath65 , ( ii ) in - triangle coefficient versus in - degree @xmath80 , and ( iii ) out - triangle coefficient versus out - degree @xmath81 , for the citation network and the average over all 18 web sites .",
    "that is , here , we consider the networks as _ directed _ graphs .    for the web sites , these three relationships closely overlap one another .",
    "this means the probability of forming triangles with a web page s in - neighbours or with its out - neighbours are the same . however , for the citation network , @xmath80 is one order of magnitude larger than @xmath81 for the same degrees .",
    "this means the probability of a paper forming triangles with its citations ( in - neighbours ) is significantly larger than it forming triangles with its references ( out - neighbours ) .",
    "this structural difference between web sites and the citation network may reflect their different evolution dynamics . for a citation network ,",
    "when a paper is published all its references existed before the publication of the paper and , of course , can not be changed . however",
    ", a paper can always acquire new citations , and these citations may reference other citations ( thus continuing to form triangles ) .",
    "in contrast , for a web site , web pages and their associated hyperlinks can be added , deleted or revised at any time . for web sites",
    ", there is no equivalent to a reference to a page that remains static and unable to be changed in the future .",
    "we examined a number of topological properties of hyperlink data crawled from 18 diverse web sites .",
    "our empirical results showed that the link structures of the web sites are significantly different when measured with 1st and 2nd - order topological properties .",
    "this is probably to be expected since the web sites are designed for different purposes and developed independently .",
    "however we observed that web sites share a common 3rd - order topological property , the relationship between triangle coefficient and degree .",
    "this common relationship is unexpected and suggestive of a topological invariant for web sites .",
    "comparison with the web , the as internet , a citation network and the barabsi - albert model showed that this third - order property is not shared across other types of networks .",
    "thus , this property appears to strongly characterise web sites .",
    "the physical meaning of this 3rd - order property is that given the number of hyperlinks to and from a particular web page , we can _ statistically _ estimate how the web page s neighbouring pages are interlinked ; and this statistical estimation is valid for all web sites",
    ".    further evaluation on a wider variety of web sites is needed to verify that this 3rd - order property is an invariant .",
    "if so , then the fundamental question is why ?",
    "possible explanations include standardised web site designing principles , popular web site developing tools , or universal evolution dynamics which fundamentally reflect the common nature and function of web sites as a way of organising and disseminating information .",
    "the answer to this question may prove valuable for research on a number of issues , such as modelling web site and other document networks , recommendations for building web sites in the future , optimizing search engine algorithms , and understanding the fundamental principles governing the evolution of the web .",
