    "the compressed baryonic matter ( cbm ) experiment is a fixed target experiment at the future experimental facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) in darmstadt .",
    "a dedicated research program aims to investigate the properties of the high net - baryon density matter in nucleus - nucleus collision in an energy range between 2  -  14  gev / u at the sis100 accelerator . due to the high interaction rates at which the experiment is designed to run , up to 10@xmath3  interactions / s",
    ", the detectors of the innermost part of the experimental setup will be exposed to high counting rates and high multiplicities environment .",
    "the time of flight ( tof ) subsystem , one of the essential detectors of the cbm experiment , is foreseen to identify charged hadrons in the angular range covered by the silicon tracking system ( sts ) ( 2.5@xmath4 - 25@xmath4 ) .",
    "it covers an active area of about 120  m@xmath5 , with an approximately rectangular shape .",
    "a full system time resolution of at least 80  ps is required , including the electronic contributions and the resolution of the time reference system , at an efficiency of at least 95% .",
    "this performance should be maintained at a counting rate which , very close to the beam pipe , exceeds 3@xmath610@xmath7  particles/(cm@xmath5@xmath6s ) @xcite .",
    "the 5  cm@xmath5 area of a readout channel ( strip ) in the most inner zone is defined by the requirement of an occupancy less than 5% .",
    "our activity has been focused on the development of a multi - gap multi - strip resistive plate counter ( mgmsrpc ) prototype for high counting rate and multiplicity environment , as it is anticipated to be implemented in the inner zone of the cbm - tof wall  @xcite .",
    "a narrow strip pitch , 2.54  mm ( 1.1  mm strip width , 1.44  mm interstrip gap ) prototype based on low resistivity glass ( @xmath010@xmath1 @xmath2 cm ) , was built as a double stack configuration with 2  x  5 gas gaps of 140  @xmath9 m each @xcite .",
    "the transmission line impedance of this prototype has 100  @xmath2 , matching the input impedance of the differential front - end electronics .",
    "its constructive details and very good performance in terms of efficiency , time resolution , position resolutions along and across the strips were already reported @xcite .",
    "however , the number of channels required to equipe the most forward polar angles of the cbm tof wall with such type of msmgrpc is quite high ( @xmath0 140,000 electronic channels ) , with direct consequence on the costs . a lower granularity prototype of 7.4  mm strip pitch ( 5.8  mm strip width , 1.6  mm interstrip gap ) , with the same inner architecture ,",
    "was designed and built further on . due to the larger strip width and double stack configuration",
    ", the differential transmission line defined by corresponding strips of the readout electrodes has 50  @xmath2 impedance .",
    "therefore , an impedance matching with input impedance of fast amplifiers of 100  @xmath2 was done at the level of fee motherboards .",
    "this prototype showed excellent performance in terms of time resolution and efficiency up to local counting rates of 10@xmath10  particles/(cm@xmath5@xmath6s ) @xcite in the in - beam test performed at the cosy facility in jlich and up to a exposure of 10@xmath7  particles/(cm@xmath5@xmath6s ) all over the counter surface @xcite at sis18 accelerator of gsi darmstadt .",
    "four prototypes with this larger strip pitch were mounted in a staggered geometry , with overlaps along and across the strips , in order to define a basic architecture which assure a continuous coverage active area in a fixed target experiment .",
    "this basic architecture was later on implemented in the proposed design of the modules for the inner zone of the cbm - tof wall based on mgmsrpcs @xcite .",
    "in order to achieve a direct matching with the 100  @xmath2 input impedance of the front - end electronics and in the same time to have the higher granularity required by the most inner zone of the cbm - tof with a resonable number of readout channels , a new mgmsrpc prototype was designed and built .",
    "the strip structure of the readout electrodes of 4.19  mm pitch ( 2.16  mm width and 2.03  mm interstrip gap ) was decided based on aplac @xcite simulations .",
    "the 64 strips of 200  mm length define an active area of 268  x  200 mm@xmath5 . as previous developed prototypes ,",
    "this prototype has also a symmetric double - stack structure of 2  x  5 gas gaps with 140  @xmath9 m thickness each gap .",

    "all signals are transported through this back pannel to the front - end electronics ( fee ) connected on the outer side of the back pannel .",
    "the signals were transfered via connectors soldered on both sides of a fr4 plate glued on the rectangular opening milled into the back pannel .",
    "two in - beam test campaigns using reaction products produced in heavy ion collisions on a pb target were focused on testing counter performance in high counting rate and multiplicity environment .",
    "the first one , carried out at sis18 of gsi darmstadt with a sm beam of 1.1@xmath6a  gev was followed by a cern sps beam test with an ar beam of 13@xmath6a  gev . in both cases ,",
    "the detector under test , rpc2013 , was positioned at polar angles of a few degrees relative to the beam axis ( at @xmath07 degrees relative to the beam line in gsi beam test and at @xmath04 degrees in cern beam test ) in order to get the maximum counting rate accessible in the experiment .",
    "a narrow strip mgmsrpc , called rpcref , described in @xcite and positioned behind rpc2013 was used as time reference .",
    "both of them were sandwiched between two plastic scintillators for rate estimates . in the cern - sps experimental set - up between rpc2013 and rpcref",
    "was positioned a mrpc with pad readout from tsinghua university , china ( padmrpc in fig.[fig : f01 ] - right side ) .",
    "a diamond detector positioned in front of the target was used as beam reference .",

    "an older version of padi , called padi3 @xcite , was used in the gsi experiment and padi8 fee in cern sps in - beam test .",

    "the first step in the data analysis is the data unpacking including the calibration and non - linearity corrections of the fpga tdcs . in the second step an iterative procedure",
    "is considered .",
    "this includes the calibration of the off - sets in time and position followed by the clusterization which groups the neighboring firing strips , correlated in time and space , in clusters .",
    "the mean of the time information delivered at both ends of a fired strip gives the arrival time of that strip .",
    "the cluster time is obtained as the mean of the strip times weighted with the time over threshold information .",
    "taking into consideration that in a collision event multiple hits can occur on the counter surface , the time of flight ( tof ) spectrum was obtained as the time difference of the best correlated clusters / hits in time and space ( the best @xmath15 matching value ) between rpc2013 and rpcref .",
    "in addition to the slewing effect correction , the tof information was corrected for the spread of the velocity of the reaction products and hit position .      the efficiency obtained with rpc2013 as a function of the padi8 threshold for two applied high voltages ( @xmath165.5  kv and @xmath165.6  kv ) , corresponding to 157  kv / cm and 160  kv / cm electric field respectively , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ]  -  left side .",
    "the efficiency is calculated as the ratio of the number of matched hits between rpc2013 and rpcref and the number of matched hits between rpcref and diamond detector .",
