    "have been answered while four of them remain still open @xcite . in this paper",
    "we make an advance on bing s question 1",
    ".    recall that a space @xmath0 is said to have the _ fixed point property _ if every continuous self - map @xmath1 has a fixed point .",
    "the fixed point property is clearly a topological invariant , but w. lopez showed in @xcite that it is not a homotopy invariant in the category of compact polyhedra ( although it is _ almost _ a homotopy invariant , see theorem [ jiangfppinvariante ] below ) . in order to provide an example lopez constructed an eight - dimensional polyhedron with the fixed point property and",
    "even euler characteristic .",
    "this example motivated the following question .",
    "[ bing1 ] is there a compact two - dimensional polyhedron with the fixed point property which has even euler characteristic ?",
    "it is not hard to find examples of two - dimensional complexes with the fixed point property . for any finite group @xmath2 with deficiency equal to @xmath3 ,",
    "there exists a @xmath4-complex @xmath0 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 . by the lefschetz fixed point theorem , any compact two - dimensional polyhedron @xmath0 with trivial rational homology has the fixed point property .",
    "however , it is unknown whether the converse of the latter statement holds",
    ". therefore we will also consider the following variation of bing s question :    [ bing2 ] is there a compact two - dimensional polyhedron with the fixed point property such that @xmath7 ?",
    "of course , an affirmative answer to question [ bing1 ] implies an affirmative answer to question [ bing2 ] .",
    "it is well - known that a polyhedron @xmath0 with @xmath8 lacks the fixed point property since @xmath9 is a retract of any such space .",
    "therefore , for a compact @xmath4-complex with the fixed point property it is equivalent to saying that @xmath10 , that @xmath11 or that @xmath12 .",
    "a higher dimensional analogue to question [ bing2 ] has been settled by waggoner @xcite for dimension @xmath13 and later extended to dimension @xmath14 by jiang @xcite .",
    "[ waggoner ] if @xmath0 is a compact @xmath15-connected polyhedron of dimension @xmath16 and @xmath7 , then @xmath0 does not have the fixed point property .    in this article",
    "a compact two - dimensional polyhedron will be called a _ bing space _ if it has the fixed point property and @xmath10 .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following    there are no bing spaces with abelian fundamental group .",
    "in particular , no space of those considered by question 1.1 can have abelian fundamental group .",
    "the ideas involved in the proof include the relationship between @xmath4-complexes and group presentations , the homotopy classification of @xmath4-complexes with finite abelian fundamental group , nielsen fixed point theory , elementary results on two - dimensional homotopy theory and obstruction theory .",
    "the strategy in the proof will also be used to prove that there are no bing spaces with fundamental group isomorphic to the alternating groups @xmath17 , the symmetric group @xmath18 or to any dihedral group .    the first part of the paper is devoted to proving that there are no bing spaces whose fundamental group has trivial schur multiplier .",
    "we will denote by @xmath19 the homology of @xmath0 with integral coefficients",
    ". a bing space must necessarily be path - connected , therefore the basepoint will be omitted in the notation for fundamental groups . by the comments above , if @xmath0 is a bing space , @xmath20 must be a torsion group , since otherwise @xmath9 would be a retract of @xmath0 , and the fixed point property is preserved by retracts .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath21 has the fixed point property if and only if both @xmath0 and @xmath22 have the fixed point property .",
    "let @xmath0 be a connected polyhedron .",
    "we say that @xmath23 is a _ local separating point _ if there is a connected open neighborhood @xmath24 of @xmath25 such that @xmath26 is not connected .",
    "we say that @xmath23 is a _ global separating point _ if @xmath27 is not connected .",
    "in particular , any global separating point is a local separating point .",
    "note that for a given triangulation every local separating point is a vertex or lies in a maximal @xmath28-simplex .",

    "[ jiangfppinvariante ] in the category of compact connected polyhedra without global separating points , the fixed point property is a homotopy type invariant .    moreover , if @xmath29 are compact connected polyhedra such that @xmath22 lacks the fixed point property and @xmath0 does not have global separating points , then @xmath0 lacks the fixed point property .",
    "the second part of the result above does not appear in jiang s original formulation .",
    "it can be deduced from its proof or , alternatively , from the first part by replacing @xmath22 by @xmath30 .",
    "recall that a presentation @xmath31 of a group @xmath2 has associated a cw - complex @xmath32 , called the _ standard complex _ of @xmath33 , with one @xmath3-cell , a @xmath28-cell for each generator @xmath34 and a @xmath4-cell for every relator @xmath35 .",

    "if in addition @xmath49 is a torsion group , we have @xmath50 if the bound above is sharp we say that @xmath2 is an _ efficient _ group .",
    "a strategy for proving that a space @xmath0 without global separating points lacks the fixed point property is to show that there exists a space @xmath51 that has @xmath52 as a retract .",
    "waggoner used this idea to prove theorem [ waggoner ] , which involves only simply - connected spaces . in this section",
    "we show to what extent we can apply this strategy in the case of an arbitrary @xmath4-complex .",
