    "quantum entanglement@xcite is the most important notion in quantum technology ( qt ) and quantum information theory ( qit ) .",
    "as shown for last two decades it plays a crucial role in quantum teleportation@xcite , superdense coding@xcite , quantum cloning@xcite , and quantum cryptography@xcite .",
    "it is also quantum entanglement , which makes the quantum computer outperform the classical one@xcite .",
    "thus , in order to develop qt and qit it is essential to understand how to quantify and how to characterize the multipartite entanglement .",
    "since the quantum entanglement is a non - local property of given multipartite quantum state , it should be invariant under the local unitary ( lu ) transformations , i.e. the unitary operations acted independently on each of the subsystems .",
    "if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are in the same category in lu , one state can be obtained with certainty from the other one by means of local operations assisted classical communication ( locc)@xcite .",
    "this implies that @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be used , respectively , to implement the same task of qit with equal probability of successful performance of the task .",
    "however , the classification of entanglement through lu generates infinite equivalence classes even in the simplest bipartite systems .    in order to escape this difficulty the classification through stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc )",
    "was suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are in the same slocc class , one state can be converted into the other state with nonzero probability by means of locc .",
    "this fact implies that @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be used , respectively , to implement the same task of qit although the probability of success for this task is different .",
    "mathematically , if two @xmath4-party states @xmath2 and @xmath3 are in the same slocc class , they are related to each other by @xmath5 with @xmath6 being arbitrary invertible local operators .",
    "however , it is more useful to restrict ourselves to slocc transformation where all @xmath6 belong to sl(@xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , the group of @xmath9 complex matrices having determinant equal to @xmath10 .",
    "the slocc classification was first examined in the three - qubit pure - state system@xcite .",
    "it was shown that the whole system consists of six inequivalent slocc classes , i.e. , fully separable ( s ) , three bi - separable ( b ) , w , and greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) classes .",
    "moreover , it is possible to know which class an arbitrary state @xmath2 belongs by computing the residual entanglement@xcite and concurrences@xcite for its partially reduced states .",
    "similarly , the entanglement of whole three - qubit mixed states consists of s , b , w , and ghz types@xcite .",
    "it was shown that these classes satisfy a linear hierarchy s @xmath11 b @xmath11 w @xmath11 ghz .",
    "generally , a given qit task requires a particular type of entanglement .",
    "in addition , the effect of environment generally converts the pure state prepared for the qit task into the mixed state .",
    "therefore , it is important to distinguish the entanglement of mixtures to perform the qit task successfully .",
    "however , it is notoriously difficult problem to know which type of entanglement is contained in the given multipartite mixed state . even for three - qubit state",
    "it is very difficult problem because analytical computation of the residual entanglement for arbitrary mixed states is generally impossible so far .",
    "recently , classification of the entanglement classes for three - qubit mixed states has been significantly progressed . in ref.@xcite",
    "the ghz symmetry was examined in three - qubit system .",
    "this is a symmetry that ghz states @xmath12 have up to the global phase and is expressed as a symmetry under ( i ) qubit permutations , ( ii ) simultaneous flips , ( iii ) qubit rotations about the @xmath13-axis .",
    "the whole ghz - symmetric states can be parametrized by two real parameters , _ say _ @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "authors in ref .",
    "@xcite succeeded in classifying the entanglement of the ghz - symmetric states completely .",
    "this complete classification makes it possible to compute the three - tangle analytically for the whole ghz - symmetric states@xcite and to construct the class - specific optimal witnesses@xcite .",
    "it also makes it possible to obtain lower bound of three - tangle for arbitrary @xmath16-qubit mixed state@xcite .",
    "more recently , the slocc classification of the extended ghz - symmetric states was discussed@xcite .",
    "extended ghz symmetry is the ghz symmetry without qubit permutation symmetry .",
    "it is larger symmetry group than usual ghz symmetry group , and is parametrized by four real parameters .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the analysis of ref.@xcite to four - qubit system .",
    "four - qubit ghz states is an unique maximally entangled @xmath16-qubit state up to lu , @xmath17 is not unique maximally entangled state . in @xmath18-qubit system",
    "there are two more additional maximally entangled states @xmath19 and @xmath20@xcite . ] ( or @xmath18-cat states@xcite , in honor of schrdinger s cat ) are defined as @xmath21 like a @xmath16-qubit ghz symmetry we define a @xmath18-qubit ghz symmetry as a symmetry which @xmath22 have up to the global phase .",
    "straightforward generalization , which is ( i ) qubit permutations , ( ii ) simultaneous flips ( i.e. , application of @xmath23 ) , ( iii ) qubit rotations about the @xmath13-axis of the form @xmath24 is obviously a symmetry of @xmath22 .",
    "thus , we will call this symmetry as @xmath18-qubit ghz symmetry . as will be shown later the @xmath18-qubit ghz - symmetric states are represented by three real parameters while @xmath16-qubit states contain only two .",
    "thus , it is more difficult to analyze the entanglement classification in @xmath18-qubit ghz - symmetric case than that in @xmath16-qubit case . furthermore , if number of qubit increases , we need real parameters more and more to represent the ghz - symmetric states .",
    "therefore , classification of the entanglement for the ghz - symmetric states becomes a formidable task in the higher - qubit system . in this reason it is advisable to restrict the ghz - symmetry to reduce the number of real parameters",
    "this can be achieved by modifying ( ii ) into ( ii ) simultaneous and any pair flips without changing ( i ) and ( iii ) . in four qubit - system",
    "this modification can be stated as an invariance under the application of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath23 . the simplest pure state which has the modified symmetry ( ii ) is @xmath31 it is easy to show that @xmath32 is symmetric under the flips of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , or @xmath39 parties .",
    "obviously , @xmath22 do not have this modified symmetry .",
    "of course , the states , which have this modified symmetry , are also ghz - symmetric .",
    "therefore , we call this modified symmetry as restricted ghz ( rghz ) symmetry given in eq .",
    "( [ modified-2 ] ) is not rghz - symmetric because it is not symmetric under the qubit rotation about the @xmath13-axis although it is symmetric under the modified ( ii ) .",
    "in fact , there is no pure rghz - symmetric state . ] .",
    "as will be shown , the rghz - symmetric states are represented by two real parameters like the @xmath16-qubit case .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the general forms of the ghz- and rghz - symmetric states are derived , respectively .",
    "it is shown that while the ghz - symmetric states are represented by three real parameters , the rghz - symmetric states are represented by two real parameters . in section iii we classify the entanglement of the rghz - symmetric states .",

    "although we start with a double bi - separable state , this fact does not implies that all states outside the polygon are double bi - separable because @xmath1 contains @xmath18-way entangled states as well as double bi - separable states .",
    "the only fact we can say is that all states outside the polygon abcd are @xmath1-class .",
    "in this paper the ghz and rghz symmetries in four - qubit system are examined .",
    "it is shown that the whole rghz - symmetric states involve only two slocc classes , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we can use our result to construct the optimal witness @xmath149 , which can detect the @xmath1-class optimally from a set of @xmath0 plus @xmath1 states .",
    "as remarked earlier if we choose ghz symmetry , the symmetric states are represented by three real parameters as eq .",
    "( [ 4q-1 ] ) shows .",
    "probably , these symmetric states involve more kinds of the four - qubit slocc classes . the slocc classification of eq .",
    "( [ 4q-1 ] ) will be explored in the future .",
    "another interesting extension of present paper is to generalize our analysis to any @xmath150-qubit system .",
    "then , our modification of symmetry should be changed into ` any one - pair , two - pair , @xmath151 , and @xmath4-pair flips ' .",
    "this would drastically reduce the number of free parameters in the set of symmetric states .",
    "this strongly restricted symmetry may shed light on the slocc classification of the multipartite states .",
