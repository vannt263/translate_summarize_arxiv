    "approximately @xmath10 of this energy is dissipated in the collisional intracluster medium ( icm ) through shocks , turbulence and compression which produce spectacular observable effects at x - ray wavelengths @xcite .",
    "observations of cluster mergers have proven valuable in constraining the nature of dark matter ( e.g. , in the bullet cluster ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the cosmic ray content of clusters @xcite , the intracluster magnetic field strength @xcite , and for understanding the physics of the icm @xcite .",
    "these studies show that deep multiwavelength observations of cluster mergers are critical if we are to understand the impact of large scale structure formation on the cluster constituents .",
    "early x - ray observations of cluster mergers using the _ rosat _ and asca satellites revealed a hot , apparently shock - heated icm in regions affected by merger activity @xcite . however , the spatial resolution was not sufficient to see the surface brightness edge expected due to the compression of gas at the shock front .",
    "the launch of the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory with its sub - arcsecond resolution and excellent sensitivity was expected to reveal many shock edges in merging clusters .",
    "in fact , while _ chandra _  has uncovered a number of merger - related edges , the vast majority are cold fronts @xcite and only a handful of shock fronts have been directly observed as sharp edges in _ chandra _  images ( in the bullet , a520 , a2146 , a2744 and a754 ; * ? ? ?",

    "the rarity of shock fronts is due to a number of factors which conspire against them being easily observable as edges in x - ray images .",
    "first , the edge created by the compression of gas at the shock front is best observed when the shock motion is very close to the plane of the sky .",
    "second , shocks are most prominent in the central regions of clusters where the x - ray surface brightness is high .",
    "this constrains observability to the relatively short core passage phase of a merger .",
    "third , merger velocities are of the order of a few thousand km / s so the shocks have mach numbers @xmath11 .",
    "this means that the temperature contrast across the edge can be low and , since temperature measurements are limited by the available counts , high quality observations are required to accurately measure the temperature jumps required to characterize edges as shocks .    here",
    "we present new and significantly deeper _ chandra _  observations of the merging cluster abell  2034 ( hereafter a2034 ) .",
    "the previous @xmath12ks _ chandra _  observation presented by @xcite  ( 2003 ; hereafter ) revealed an edge to the north of the cluster which was interpreted as a cold front , although it was noted that the temperature contrast across the edge was not as strong as in other cold fronts .",
    "cold fronts are contact discontinuities which occur at the interface of low - entropy gas moving through a higher - entropy medium . by definition ,",
    "the pressure across a contact discontinuity is continuous .",
    "@xcite subsequently excluded a2034 from their sample of cold front clusters since the pressure across the edge did not appear to be continuous .",
    "the properties of the edge indicated that it may be a shock , although the data at hand were not of sufficient depth to conclusively show this . interestingly , radio observations of a2034 show evidence for diffuse emission near the northern edge which was tentatively classified as a radio relic @xcite although @xcite classify the diffuse radio emission in a2034 as a halo .",
    "the emission from radio halos and relics is a result of the interaction of a population of relativistic electrons with the cluster magnetic field which results in synchrotron radiation at radio wavelengths . while the favored model for the production of relativistic electrons producing the large scale ( @xmath13mpc ) radio halos is reacceleration of mildly relativistic electrons due to merger driven turbulence @xcite , it is likely that shocks provide the mechanism by which radio relics are formed @xcite .",
    "models for shock - induced radio relics include the direct acceleration of thermal electrons @xcite , the reacceleration of preexisting mildly relativistic electrons @xcite and the revival of fossil radio plasma by adiabatic compression from the shock @xcite .",
    "the existence of a radio relic near the northern edge may therefore be taken as indirect evidence that the edge is a shock front .",
    "the available @xmath14ks of _ chandra _  data allow us to show that the edge in a2034 is a shock front .",
    "the characterization of this edge as a shock , combined with the information provided from our optical spectroscopy taken with the mmt - hectospec instrument , allow us to make a more precise determination of the merger history in a2034 .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section  [ data ] we describe the _ chandra _  and mmt data to be used in our analysis . in section  [ analysis ]",
    "we present images and temperature maps of the icm , surface brightness and temperature profiles across the edge , define spectroscopically confirmed cluster membership and determine the spatial distribution of cluster members . in sections  [ discussion ] and [ conclusion ]",
    "we discuss our results and present our conclusions . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume a standard @xmath15cdm cosmology with @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18@xmath6@xmath19 .",
    "the cluster redshift determined from our sample of confirmed cluster members is @xmath20 ( section  [ membership ] ) which , given the assumed cosmology , means @xmath21kpc .",
    "details of the _ chandra _  observations used in this paper are summarized in table  [ xray_obs ] .",
    "all _ chandra _  observations were taken on the acis - i chip array .",
    "the 54ks _ chandra _  observation used in ( _ chandra _  obsid 2204 ) was taken on 2001 may .",
    "the newer 200ks exposure was split into four separate observations ( obsids 12885 , 12886 , 13192 and 13193 ) taken during 2010 november .",
    "the aimpoint of the new observations was carefully chosen to ensure that none of the chip gaps obscure critical regions near the edge discussed in .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "data were reprocessed using the chandra_repro script within the ciao software package ( version 4.4 * ? ? ?",
    "the script applies the latest calibrations to the data ( caldb 4.5.6 ) , creates an observation - specific bad pixel file by identifying hot pixels and events associated with cosmic rays ( utilizing vfaint observation mode ) and filters the event list to include only events with _",

    "the energy dependence of the effective area is accounted for by computing a weighted instrument map with the sherpa make_instmap_weights script using an absorbed mekal spectral model with @xmath22 @xcite , the average cluster values of @xmath23kev and abundance 0.29 times solar and @xmath24 .",

    "the observations were performed using the 270 groove mm@xmath37 grating which provided coverage of the wavelength interval @xmath38 at @xmath39 resolution .",
    "around 30 fibers per configuration were allocated to blank sky regions for the purpose of sky subtraction .",

    "this is the edge that was interpreted as being due to a cold front by , but called into question as such by @xcite .",
    "the deeper data reveal that the edge is well defined over a larger opening angle than that seen in and has a morphology resembling a bow - shock - cone seen in projection .",
    "the axis of symmetry ( hereafter referred to as the `` nose '' ) is approximately due north of the x - ray brightness peak and corresponds to the central sector in figure  9a of . under their assumption of a circular front",
    ", the nose of the shock cone was interpreted as an excess of emission located ahead of the edge by .",
    "it is possible that their analysis was hindered by the position of a chip gap in obsid 2204 over the western portion of the edge which significantly reduced the exposure in that region .",

    "[ chan_img],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    as noted by , to the south of the x - ray peak there is an extended region of low surface brightness emission which is @xmath44  long .",
    "our deeper data show that this low surface brightness emission is elongated with the axis of elongation pointing just east of south . based on the fairly regular",
    ", diffuse morphology revealed by their shallower data , offered three explanations for this excess .",
    "two of these explanations centred around the southern excess being associated with a smaller subcluster which is merging with a2034 .",
    "the third and most favored explanation was that the south excess was due to the emission associated with a background cluster seen in projection through a2034 .",
    "the highly elongated morphology , along with the lack of any clear galaxy association in the deeper sdss images ( figure  [ opt_chan ] ) indicate that the background cluster interpretation may be incorrect .",
    "in figure  [ opt_chan ] we overlay contours from an adaptively smoothed _",
    "chandra _",
    "image onto an sdss rgb image .",
    "the peak in the x - ray emission is 172kpc to the north of the bcg ( hereafter , bcg1 ) , while there does appear to be a less - prominent peak in the x - ray emission coincident with bcg1 . just north of the nose of the edge is another bright cluster member which we have labeled bcg2",
    ". some @xmath45kpc south of the nose is a diffuse clump of emission , while a finger of emission extends from the eastern portion of the edge toward the south .",
    "the deeper data also reveal a low surface brightness asymmetry @xmath46kpc east of the peak in the x - ray brightness .    .",
    "there are 20 contours starting at @xmath47 and have asinh spacing to the maximum value of @xmath48 . [ opt_chan],scaledwidth=45.0% ]      for the purpose of understanding the spectral properties of the icm in a2034 , we construct temperature and hardness ratio maps . the hardness ratio , defined here as the ratio of the flux in the @xmath49kev and @xmath50kev bands , does not produce a direct measure of the gas temperature",
    ". however , for a given number of source counts a hardness ratio map provides a simpler , higher signal - to - noise , model - independent diagnostic of the spectral properties in a region when compared with a single thermal component temperature map .",
    "moreover , a hardness ratio map may reveal regions where a single component thermal model does not adequately describe the spectral properties of the icm .",
    "therefore , the hardness ratio and temperature maps can provide a complementary , quasi - independent , spatially resolved probe of the icm spectral properties .",
    "the temperature maps are generated in a similar manner to that described in @xcite and are shown in the top left and top right panels of figure  [ tmap ] .",
    "briefly , each temperature map has pixels with a constant size ( @xmath51 ) and spectra for each pixel are extracted from a circular region with radius set such that the region contains a constant number of background subtracted 0.5 - 7kev source counts .",
    "we produce a high spatial resolution map with 2000 source counts per extraction region , and a lower spatial resolution map with 8000 source counts per extraction region .",
    "the higher resolution temperature map provides a more accurate picture where there are abrupt changes in temperature , such as near shock and cold fronts .",
    "the lower resolution temperature map provides more accurate temperatures , particularly for the higher temperature regions , although it significantly smears out sharp gradients in temperature . for both maps , but more so the 8000 count map , in the low surface brightness regions the pixel values are correlated over large distances . to demonstrate this effect , we show extraction region sizes as black circles at five locations in the top left and top right panels of figure  [ tmap ] .",
    "redistribution matrix files ( rmfs ) and ancilliary response files ( arfs ) are generated with the ciao mkacisrmf and mkwarf tools , respectively . because the rmfs can take several minutes to process , and because there are @xmath52 spectra to process , we extract the rmfs and arfs on a more coarsely binned grid with @xmath53 pixels .",
    "the size of the extraction regions are generally much larger than the pixel size of this coarser grid , so the impact on the temperature measurements is small and well within the measurement uncertainties .",
    "the five spectra per pixel are fitted simultaneously in xspec ( version 12.7.1 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with an absorbed mekal model @xcite . during the fitting the temperature",
    "is left as a free parameter which is tied across the spectra and the abundance is fixed at the global value @xmath54 which is measured with respect to solar values ( using ratios from * ? ? ?",
    "the normalizations are also left as free parameters , however for observations with similar pointings the values are tied together .",
    "spectra are constrained to the energy range 0.7 - 7kev , binned to contain at least one count per energy bin , and the modified cash statistic , wstat , is minimized .",
    "the lower left panel of figure  [ tmap ] shows the upper confidence interval for the higher resolution , 2000 count , temperature map expressed as a fraction of the best fit temperature .",
    "the confidence intervals are measured at the @xmath55 level ( corresponding to @xmath56 ) and are determined for a single parameter of interest .",
    "the confidence intervals are skewed about the best fit so that the upper confidence interval is generally a factor of @xmath57 higher than the lower confidence interval .",
    "where the x - ray surface brightness is high , the upper confidence intervals are @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the best fit temperature for regions which have @xmath60kev and @xmath61kev , respectively . in the lower surface brightness regions , where the background flux begins to dominate , the relative uncertainties become much larger ( @xmath62 ) where @xmath61kev .",
    "given these uncertainties , regions with @xmath63kev are cooler than regions with @xmath64kev with @xmath65 confidence .",
    "comparing the higher and lower resolution temperature maps , there is qualitative agreement on large scales . clearly the distribution of temperatures is less patchy for the lower resolution , 8000 count , map and this is due to two main reasons .",
    "first , hot regions where @xmath66kev are less well constrained in the higher resolution , 2000 count , map and excursions to much higher temperatures on smaller scales may simply be due to statistical fluctuations which are not significant .",
    "the relative uncertainties on the lower resolution map are generally @xmath67 and so the temperature map is considerably less noisy .",
    "second , the large aperture required to collect 8000 counts smooths out real fluctuations in temperature which occur on scales smaller than the aperture . for example , the extraction region near the sharp edge to the north is roughly twice the diameter in the lower resolution map when compared with the higher resolution map ( see the black circles in the top panels of figure  [ tmap ] ) .",
    "therefore , the temperature measurement on the brighter side of the edge is significantly contaminated by flux from the fainter side of the edge , washing out the sharp temperature gradient which is significant in the higher resolution map . for the remainder of this section",
    ", we focus our discussion around significant features seen in the higher resolution , 2000 count , map .",
    "the lower right panel of figure  [ tmap ] shows the hardness ratio map .",
    "the map is produced by smoothing the background - subtracted and exposure - corrected 2 - 7kev and 0.5 - 7kev band images with a gaussian kernel with an adaptive smoothing length .",
    "rather than choosing an adaptive smoothing width based on one of the images ( e.g. , as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we follow a similar method to that used in @xcite .",
    "that is , we set the smoothing length such that the hardness ratio at each pixel has a relative uncertainty of @xmath68 .",
    "comparison of the hardness ratio and temperature maps show that high temperature regions in the high resolution temperature map clearly map regions which are significantly harder in the hardness ratio map .",
    "this provides confidence that the regions with high temperature values in the 2000 count temperature map are regions with significantly harder , and likely hotter , emission .",
    "however , near the eastern portion of the edge there some differences between the high resolution temperature map and the hardness ratio map which we discuss below .",
    "+     +    the distribution of temperatures is patchy and complicated and is broadly consistent with the map presented in , although the deeper observations reveal several features associated with the northern edge which were not previously identified .",
    "the region corresponding to the nose of the northern edge has @xmath69kev and is significantly hotter than the icm lying further north of the nose , which has @xmath70kev .",
    "this hotspot is highlighted by a black circle the radius of which shows the size of the extraction region there .",
    "while discuss a hot spot in the vicinity of the nose , it appears that the peak temperature in the hotspot seen in their figure  7 lies somewhat further south and away from the nose .",
    "we confirm that the region discussed in is in fact hotter than its surrounds , but stress that it is separate from the hotspot detected at the nose .",
    "the sector of the edge lying to the west of the nose also shows a strong gradient in temperature in the sense that the temperature drops sharply going from the brighter side of the edge ( @xmath71kev ) to the fainter side ( @xmath72kev ) .",
    "we note a second hot spot with @xmath73kev at the westernmost point of the edge .",
    "thus , the nose and western sectors of the edge appear to harbour thermal properties which are more consistent with the edge being a shock front rather than a cold front .    in defining the position of the edge ,",
    "appear to have focused on the sector just east of the nose .",
    "figure  [ tmap ] shows that the thermal properties of this eastern sector are somewhat abnormal .",
    "near to the nose the temperature distribution is shock - like ; inside the edge the temperature is @xmath74kev and drops abruptly to the north to @xmath75kev although there are several patches of hotter @xmath76kev gas further ahead of the edge .",
    "these hotter @xmath77kev patches are also seen as a region of hard emission in the hardness ratio map . following the edge further southeast",
    ", the temperature on the bright side of the edge drops abruptly to @xmath78kev , similar to the temperature just outside the edge there .",
    "the constant temperature going from the inside to the outside of the edge does not appear to be consistent with the behavior expected of a shock or cold front .",
    "the hardness ratio map shows a finger of emission which starts at the edge and extends to the south .",
    "this finger is significantly softer than the surrounding icm .",
    "the hardness ratio map has better spatial resolution than the temperature map , and it shows that this soft finger does not follow the surface brightness contours which trace the edge .",
    "the nature of this soft finger of emission is unclear , but it is likely responsible for the odd behaviour observed in the temperature map near the eastern portion of the edge . since projection effects and",
    "cross contamination of emission from either side of the edge may wash out temperature gradients at the edge , we will investigate the profile across the edge further in section  [ profiles ] using well - defined regions inside and outside the edge .    aside from the edge ,",
    "there are several other features of note in the temperature map .",
    "as noted in , the temperature at the peak in the x - ray surface brightness is cooler than its surrounds . to the south of the peak in the x - ray surface brightness is a band of hot @xmath79kev gas that extends @xmath80kpc along an east - west axis ( similar to the hot region seen just west of the main cluster in the bullet ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "embedded within this hot band is a region of enhanced surface brightness and cooler @xmath81kev gas which is spatially coincident with bcg1 ( open white diamond symbol in the left panel of figure  [ tmap ] ) .",
    "further south , the temperature maps show that the extended region of low surface brightness emission discussed in section  [ chan_image ] harbors cooler @xmath82kev gas . at large radii ,",
    "the temperature of the gas is generally much cooler than the central regions and has @xmath83kev .        as a first step toward understanding the physical nature of the northern edge",
    ", we examine the surface brightness profile in that region with the aim of measuring the density jump at the edge . to that end",
    "we import the broken powerlaw density model ( described in detail in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) into the _ sherpa _ package and fit to the 0.5 - 7kev image near the edge",

    "the temperatures are tied and the normalizations are allowed to vary .",
    "the temperatures measured in each sector for the annuli immediately inside and outside the edge are presented in table  [ temps ] , as are the temperatures derived from the simultaneous fits .",
    "the temperature profile for the `` total '' sector reveals @xmath118kev gas in the first two annuli , dropping to @xmath76kev just inside the edge .",
    "the temperatures measured in the two annuli outside the edge are consistent within their uncertainties at @xmath119kev . while the best - fitting temperature is higher on the brighter side of the edge when compared with the fainter side , the difference is marginal and the two temperatures are consistent within their uncertainties .",
    "however , the temperature measurement just inside the edge is affected by the projection of cooler gas lying along the line of sight . to demonstrate the impact of this projected gas on the temperature measurement",
    ", we estimate the deprojected temperature just inside the edge , shown as an open pentagon in figure  [ sb_tot ] .",
    "the deprojection is performed in the manner described in @xcite .",
    "briefly , a second mekal component is included in the fit to the spectra for the region just inside the edge .",
    "the temperature of this component is fixed at the best fitting temperature determined from the fit to the annular region just outside the edge .",
    "the normalisation of this second component is also fixed to the best fitting normalisation determined in the region just outside the edge , but it is corrected by a scaling factor which accounts for the different emission measures expected from the different volumes probed .",
    "this scaling factor is determined from the best fitting density model .",
    "the deprojected temperature is @xmath120kev and is consistent within the uncertainties with the projected measure of @xmath121kev .",
    "considering the temperature profiles obtained in the equi - angular sectors , the `` nose '' and `` west '' sectors ( top right and bottom right panels in figure  [ sb_tot ] , respectively ) show abrupt drops in temperature going from @xmath122kev on the inside to @xmath123kev on the outside of the edge .",
    "the differences in temperature are significant at the @xmath124 level ( including the uncertainty due to the background normalization ) .",
    "conversely , the temperature profile for the `` east '' sector shows an increase in temperature going from the inside to the outside of the edge , although the uncertainties on the outer measurement are large .",
    "however , the simultaneous fits to the larger radial ranges in the `` east '' sector indicate that the temperatures are consistent at 7.5kev across the edge .",
    "having determined the temperature and density on either side of the edge , we are now in a position to determine the physical nature of the edge as a shock or cold front . in the case of a cold front , the pressure is expected to be approximately continuous across the edge , a fact borne out in observations @xcite .",
    "thus , for an ideal gas where the pressure  @xmath125 the condition @xmath126 must hold across the edge where @xmath127 .",
    "given the temperature measured on the inside of the edge , @xmath128 ( table  [ temps ] ) , we can use this condition to predict the temperature we expect to measure outside the edge , @xmath129 , assuming that the edge is a cold front . for each sector",
    ", we list the predicted @xmath129 for a cold front in table  [ temps ] . in all but",
    "the `` east '' sector , the measured value for @xmath129 is significantly lower than that predicted under the assumption of a cold front .",
    "this is also demonstrated by directly measuring the pressure jump at the edge , also listed in table  [ temps ] , where in the majority of cases the pressure jump is inconsistent with unity , with the only exception being the `` east '' sector which is marginally consistent with unity .",
    "we conclude that the edge can not be a cold front .    along similar lines",
    ", we can compare the measured properties across the edge under the assumption that it is caused by a shock front . in this case , a pressure jump is expected @xcite and the temperatures inside and outside the edge are related to the density jump by the rankine - hugoniot jump condition @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the adiabatic index for a monatomic gas . comparing the @xmath129 expected in the case of a shock front with the observed values in table  [ temps ] , there is better agreement when compared with the cold front model for the `` total '' , `` nose '' and `` west '' sectors .",
    "again , there is a discrepancy between the shock model and the observations for the `` east '' sector .",
    "we note that for this part of the front , temperatures for the preshock spectra are affected by the hot region east of the front and those for the postshock spectra are affected by the cool filament discussed in section  [ tempmaps ] , neither of which appear to be related to the front .",
    "while it is difficult to understand the properties for the `` east '' sector under the assumption of these two models , it is clear that the remainder of the edge is consistent with being due to a shock front . in particular , under the shock interpretation it is within the `` nose '' sector that the observed and predicted density , temperature and pressure jumps should have best agreement .",
    "this is because it is within this sector that the assumptions used in determining the rankine - hugoniot relations , i.e. a one - dimensional shock with all of the gas motion being normal to the edge surface , are most likely to hold .",
    "indeed , it is here that we see the best agreement between the observed properties and those expected if the edge is a shock .",

    "this local peak in the galaxy surface density also coincides with a significant local peak in the projected mass map in @xcite .",
    "this provides strong evidence for a significantly massive structure associated with bcg2 .    aside from the two prominent substructures associated with bcg1 and bcg2 ,",

    "the deeper _ chandra _  data presented here reveal in more detail the merger - related features discussed in .",
    "the simplest interpretation of the data is that a2034 has undergone a two - body merger viewed close to the plane of the sky and just after a low impact parameter core passage .",
    "the merger axis is aligned along a north - south direction with the secondary subcluster currently traveling to the north and away from the primary cluster . here",
    "we discuss the evidence supporting this scenario .",
    "perhaps the strongest evidence for the proposed merger scenario comes from the edge to the north .",
    "the temperature and density measurements across the edge ( section  [ profiles ] ) show that it can not be a cold front and that its properties are consistent with it being a merger shock .",
    "this shock is presumably driven by the subcluster revealed as a local overdensity in the galaxy distribution .",

    "inserting this expected density jump into equation  [ mach_eqn ] gives @xmath185 , consistent within the uncertainties with the mach number derived using the density jump .",
    "the sharpness of the edge indicates that the shock motion is largely perpendicular to our line of sight ( los ) . assuming that bcg2 , just north of the nose of the shock , is the central galaxy of the infalling subcluster",
    ", we can use it to estimate the component of shock motion along our los .",
    "its proximity to the shock suggests that it is moving at a similar velocity .",
    "the central bcg , bcg1 , has @xmath186 ( @xmath187@xmath6  with respect to @xmath188 ) while bcg2 has @xmath189 ( @xmath190@xmath6 ) .",
    "the difference in peculiar velocity is @xmath191@xmath6  which indicates that some of the motion of the shock may be directed along our los . assuming that the peculiar velocities of these two galaxies are representative of their associated substructures , and that the shock and substructure galaxies are comoving , the velocities can be used to constrain the inclination to the plane of the sky @xmath192 .",
    "given the shock velocity , the inclination angle and the distance from the bcg1 ( @xmath193kpc ) we estimate that the core passage occurred @xmath194gyr ago , similar to the timescales estimated for the bullet and a2146 @xcite .",
    "this evidence reinforces the hypothesis that the merger in a2034 is observed shortly after core passage , and is occurring on an axis which is close to the plane of the sky .",
    "it is interesting to note that the surface brightness profiles across the shock presented in section  [ sb_prof ] indicate that the eastern portion of the shock is brighter than the western portion .",
    "the cause of this asymmetry is unclear , although we present two hypotheses that may explain this .",
    "the first hypothesis is that the distribution of the pre - shocked icm is asymmetric about the nose of the shock . in this scenario ,",
    "the pre - shocked icm to the east of the nose is denser than that to the west .",
    "this will generally lead to a higher density in the postshock gas there . since the x - ray surface brightness @xmath195 , where @xmath196 is the distance along the los , the surface brightness will be enhanced .",
    "an asymmetric distribution of pre - shocked icm about the nose of the shock can occur if the merger is not directly head - on .",
    "an excellent example of this effect can be seen in the simulations of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , their figure 3 ) . however , for a2034 the peak of the x - ray emission and the nose of the shock lie approximately on a line connecting bcg1 and bcg2 .",
    "this indicates that the impact parameter must not have been large .",
    "alternatively , if the icm associated with a2034 was initially ellipsoidal with major axis running from southwest to northeast then this would produce the desired pre - shocked icm asymmetry for a head - on merger .",
    "the second hypothesis is that the shock may be propagating through an inhomogenous and/or non - static icm , as suggested by @xcite to explain the `` m - shaped '' shock in the cluster rxj1314.4 - 2512 .",
    "this may distort the shape of the shock front , leading to an asymmetric brightness distribution .      the spatial distribution of the galaxies in comparison to",
    "the icm also supports our favored merger scenario . during the core passage phase of a head on merger",
    ", the icm of the subclusters can be ram - pressure stripped from the collisionless galaxies and dark matter .",
    "this leads to an offset in the x - ray and galaxy centroid which is a strong indicator of the direction of motion .",
    "the most prominent example of this is seen in the bullet cluster @xcite , although counter - examples exist @xcite .",
    "considering the central cluster region , figure  [ dense_chan ] shows that bcg1 and the peak in galaxy surface density are approximately cospatial , while the main peak in the x - ray emission located 172kpc away just east of due north . in our scenario , this offset occurred when the secondary subcluster associated with bcg2 traversed the core from the south on its way to the observed position in the north .",
    "the force on the gas due to this high speed encounter has displaced the icm from the core of the main cluster and bcg1 .",
    "however , the separation of the gas and dark matter components does not appear to be as clean as that seen in the bullet cluster .",
    "the projected distribution of mass seen in the lensing maps of @xcite is complex with two significant mass clumps in the core , neither of which is spatially coincident with bcg1 .",
    "nevertheless , the clumpy mass distribution indicates a strongly disturbed structure indicative of recent merger activity .",
    "similarly , the gas and galaxies associated with the secondary substructure were also separated , with the secondary s galaxies now coincident with the nose of the shock cone . unlike in the bullet cluster",
    ", we do not observe a prominent dense cool core trailing the secondary s galaxies .",
    "if the gas core did not harbor a dense , cool core prior to the merger , ( as is the case for around @xmath197 of local clusters ; see * ? ? ? * ) then it would have been more prone to disruption during the core passage .",
    "there does appear to be clumpy emission located just south of the shock which is cooler than the surrounding shock heated gas .",
    "we speculate that this is the remnant of the gas core previously associated with the secondary and that the core has been completely disrupted by the merger .    further evidence for the removal of gas from the secondary may come from the tail of excess emission located south of bcg1 ( the south excess in figure  [ chan_img ] ) .",
    "s favored interpretation is that this emission comes from a background cluster . alternatively , suggest that the southern excess may be associated with another subcluster merger in a2034 .",
    "we do see a local peak in the galaxy surface density @xmath198kpc south of bcg1 which coincides with a @xmath199 magnitude galaxy and may be associated with the southern excess .",
    "however , in our merger scenario this emission can be interpreted as gas which has been stripped from the outer parts of the bcg2 subcluster as it fell from the south toward the primary core .    in n - body hydrodynamic models for the bullet cluster @xcite , the shock runs ahead of the subcluster during the initial infall phase of the merger .",
    "after core passage , when the subcluster s gas core is displaced from the galaxies and dark matter , the remnant gas core of the infalling subcluster acts as the `` piston '' driving the shock .",
    "if the gas core is disrupted as we suggest for a2034 , the shock can weaken and slow , allowing the galaxies and dark matter to overtake it .",
    "thus , we speculate that the merger shock in a2034 may be dying , consistent with its relatively low mach number ( compared with , e.g. , the m=2 - 3 shocks in other clusters ; * ? ? ? * ) and the position of bcg2 ahead of the front .",
    "the simulations have also shown that the icm of the main cluster is accelerated towards the infalling subcluster , boosting the speed of the shock in the gas significantly compared to its speed through the cluster @xcite .",
    "thus , the speed through the cluster of the remnant galaxies may be significantly less than the shock speed of @xmath200 .",
    "if so , we may also have underestimated the time since core passage of the merger .",
    "we also caution that a lower shock speed , and any relative motion between the shock and the galaxies ahead of the shock , will affect the inclination angle estimated in section  [ mach ] .      ) with 1.4ghz radio contours overlaid .",

    "[ radio],scaledwidth=47.0% ]    previous studies have shown that there is diffuse radio emission in the vicinity of the shock to the north @xcite .",
    "the classification of this diffuse radio emission is unclear .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite suggest that the diffuse emission may be a radio relic , although @xcite classify it as a radio halo . in figure",
    "[ radio ] we overlay two sets of 1.4ghz radio contours onto a _ chandra _  image .",
    "the red contours are the same westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wrst ) data presented in @xcite , while the blue contours are taken from vla - first data @xcite .",
    "the vla - first data show a head - tail galaxy and wide - angle - tailed radio galaxy located to the southwest of the cluster core .",
    "both of these galaxies are cluster members and their radio properties suggest high relative motion with respect to the icm .",
    "the deeper wrst data reveal that the diffuse emission has an irregular morphology , while there is point source emission associated with both bcg1 and bcg2 . in the region near the shock , there is weak , diffuse radio emission just behind the nose and eastern part of the front .",
    "given the irregular radio morphology ( compare with that seen in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the weak spatial correlation with the shock edge , we suggest that the emission is due to the revival of pre - existing radio plasma which has been overrun by the shock , rather than being a consequence of direct acceleration of thermal electrons at the shock front .",
    "the direct acceleration scenario requires mach numbers @xmath203 to produce observable radio emission @xcite .",
    "therefore , the low mach number measured in section  [ mach ] provides further evidence against the direct acceleration scenario in a2034 ( as in a754 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fossil radio plasma can be revived by a shock through either the reacceleration of the mildly relativistic electrons @xcite , or due to adiabatic compression of the plasma @xcite .",
    "the reacceleration scenario predicts a single powerlaw spectrum with a slope related to the mach number of the shock @xcite , whereas the compression scenario predicts a much steeper slope at higher frequencies .",
    "therefore , deep multi - band radio observations of a2034 , which can be used to measure the integrated and spatially resolved spectral indices , will help to constrain the nature of the emission and its relation to the shock ( e.g. , as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    on the classification of the source as a halo or relic , the passage of a shock which excites a radio relic should also align the magnetic field so that it is perpendicular to the shock surface @xcite .",
    "this leads to ordered polarization vectors ( as observed in cizaj2242.8 + 5301 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas in radio halos the polarization is much weaker and has less well - ordered polarization vectors @xcite . as pointed out in @xcite , polarimetric observations will have the potential to distinguish radio halo emission from shock - related relic emission in a2034 .",
    "we present a deep 250ks exposure of the merging cluster a2034 . a previous study using shallower _",
    "chandra _  data revealed a sharp edge to the north of the x - ray peak which was interpreted as being due to a cold front .",
    "our deeper data have revealed that this interpretation can not be correct , since the pressure is not continuous across any part of the edge .",
    "we show that the properties across the edge are consistent with it being caused by a shock with mach number @xmath181 , corresponding to a shock velocity of @xmath204@xmath6 .",
    "we supplement our _ chandra _  data with 328 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members drawn mainly from our mmt / hectospec survey of the cluster . the spatial distribution of cluster members shows a complex distribution of local peaks in galaxy surface density .",
    "notably , we confirm the existence of a substructure located at the nose of the shock cone which is the remnant of the merging substructure responsible for the shock .",
    "these observations indicate that a2034 is a cluster merger with a merger axis viewed within @xmath7 of the plane of the sky .",
    "the subclusters are moving apart along a north - south direction approximately @xmath8gyr after a low impact parameter core passage .",
    "the subcluster s gas core , which acted as the piston driving the shock , appears to have been completely destroyed during the core passage .",
    "the disruption of the piston may have led to a weakening of the shock which we speculate is now dying .",
    "given its proximity , the possible radio relic is likely a result of the shock , although deeper radio observations are required to confirm its nature .",

    "<S> we present a 250ks _ chandra _  observation of the cluster merger a2034 with the aim of understanding the nature of a sharp edge previously characterized as a cold front . </S>",
    "<S> the new data reveal that the edge is coherent over a larger opening angle and is significantly more bow - shock - shaped than previously thought . within @xmath0 about the axis of symmetry of the edge the density , temperature and pressure drop abruptly by factors of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this is inconsistent with the pressure equilibrium expected of a cold front and we conclude that the edge is a shock front . </S>",
    "<S> we measure a mach number @xmath4 and corresponding shock velocity @xmath5@xmath6 . using spectra collected at the mmt with the hectospec multi - object spectrograph </S>",
    "<S> we identify 328 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members . </S>",
    "<S> significantly , we find a local peak in the projected galaxy density associated with a bright cluster galaxy which is located just ahead of the nose of the shock . </S>",
    "<S> the data are consistent with a merger viewed within @xmath7 of the plane of the sky . </S>",
    "<S> the merging subclusters are now moving apart along a north - south axis approximately @xmath8gyr after a small impact parameter core passage . </S>",
    "<S> the gas core of the secondary subcluster , which was driving the shock , appears to have been disrupted by the merger . without a driving `` piston '' </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that the shock is dying . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we propose that the diffuse radio emission near the shock is due to the revival of pre - existing radio plasma which has been overrun by the shock . </S>"
