    "in a weakly - interacting massive particle dark matter ( wimp dm ) scenario , a dm particle with mass of @xmath13  gev ",
    "tev should have an ( thermally - averaged ) annihilation cross section of @xmath15 in order to reproduce the observed dm abundance due to the thermal production . on the other hand , recently reported excesses of cosmic - ray positron  @xcite and electron fluxes  @xcite may be interpreted as signatures of annihilating dark matter with fairly large annihilation cross section of order of @xmath16 ",
    "@xmath17 depending on dm mass @xmath18 , which is typically three orders of magnitude larger than the canonical value quoted above , although constraints from other observations , such as gamma - rays  @xcite and neutrinos  @xcite are also stringent and might have already excluded some parameter regions .",
    "one way to achieve the `` boost factor '' of @xmath19 is to make the dm annihilation cross section velocity - dependent . in this case",
    "the annihilation cross section in the early universe is not same as that in the galaxy or elsewhere , simply because typical velocity of the dm particle varies from place to place .",
    "hence it is in principle possible that the dm has canonical annihilation cross section at the freezeout epoch in the early universe reproducing the dm abundance observed by wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) , while explaining the cosmic - ray positron / electron excesses .",
    "a common mechanism would be sommerfeld enhancement of annihilation cross section  @xcite .",
    "if a dm interacts with a light particle through which it annihilates , non - perturbative effects enhance the annihilation cross section .",
    "the cross section is enhanced by inverse of the dm velocity , @xmath20 or @xmath21 , in this class of models . in the breit - wigner enhancement scenario on the other hand , dm annihilates through @xmath22-channel resonance where a particle in the intermediate state has a mass close to two times dm mass  @xcite . in this case",
    "the dm cross section can scale as @xmath23 at an earlier time or @xmath21 at a later time .",
    "in these models the annihilation cross section increases as the temperature decreases in the early universe , and hence dm continues to inject high energy particles through the cosmic history .",
    "therefore , it is quite non - trivial whether these models satisfy constraints from big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . in the case of velocity - independent annihilation cross section , bounds from bbn  @xcite and cmb  @xcite were derived in previous works . in this paper",
    ", we extend the analysis to the velocity - dependent annihilation cross section and derive general upper bound on the annihilation cross section .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "below we briefly give examples of dm with velocity - dependent annihilation cross section .",
    "after that we will explain our unified treatment for describing the cosmological effects from dm annihilation with velocity - dependent annihilation cross section .",
    "a dm particle @xmath24 is assumed to have an interaction with @xmath25 , which may be a scalar or gauge boson with coupling constant @xmath26 , whose mass is much lighter than the dm mass : @xmath27 .",
    "let us consider the dm annihilation process mediated by @xmath25 exchanges .",
    "if the mass of @xmath25 is sufficiently small , the @xmath25-mediated interaction can be regarded as a long - range force and such an annihilation cross section receives an enhancement @xmath22 compared with tree - level perturbative expression  @xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the initial dm velocity in the center of mass frame .",
    "thus the dm annihilation cross section is proportional to @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "this @xmath30 enhancement saturates at @xmath32 .",
    "there is another interesting effect caused by the bound state formation , which resonantly enhances the dm annihilation rate for some specific dm mass  @xcite .",
    "it is known that the enhancement is proportional to @xmath21 near the zero - energy resonance , and this @xmath21 behavior also saturates due to the finite width of the bound state .      in the breit - wigner enhancement scenario ,",
    "dm particles annihilate through @xmath22-channel particle exchange ( @xmath25 ) , where the mass of @xmath25 , @xmath33 , is close to @xmath34 .",
    "the square amplitude of this @xmath22-channel process is proportional to @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are defined as @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is the decay width of @xmath25 ) , respectively .",
    "if @xmath36 and @xmath37 are much smaller than unity , we have @xmath41 in the limit @xmath42 $ ] . at smaller velocity ,",
    "it becomes proportional to @xmath21 . finally , in sufficiently small @xmath29 the cross section saturates at a constant value .",
    "some dm models have velocity - dependent annihilation cross section as described above . in order to treat the effects of velocity - dependence , we phenomenologically parametrize the annihilation cross section as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a constant",
    ", @xmath29 is the ( thermal - averaged ) velocity of dm particle , and @xmath45 is the velocity at the freezeout of dm annihilation in the velocity - independent case .",
    "typically , the freezeout temperature is given by @xmath46  @xcite , which gives @xmath47 ; in our numerical calculations , we take @xmath48 independently of @xmath49 although the freezeout epoch may deviate from @xmath50 given above . in eq .  , @xmath51 is a dimensionless parameter which determines the cutoff below which the velocity - dependence disappears . since we are interested in the case that @xmath52 , we recover @xmath53 in the limit @xmath54",
    ".    the power law index @xmath49 and the cutoff parameter @xmath51 depend on models .",
    "the sommerfeld enhancement predicts @xmath55 and @xmath56 , while it also predicts @xmath57 in the zero - energy resonance region . in the breit - wigner enhancement",

    "thus , we consider the cases of @xmath55 and @xmath64 in the following analysis , and it would give conservative bounds on the breit - wigner enhancement .    with the annihilation cross section being given ,",
    "the annihilation term in the boltzmann equation , which governs the evolution of the number density of dm @xmath65 , is given by @xmath66_{\\rm ann } =     - n_{\\rm dm}^2 \\langle \\sigma v\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in deriving constraints from bbn and cmb , spectra of injected energy per unit time are needed for all the daughter particles . for the particle species @xmath67 ,",

    ", it is evident that the energy injection per comoving volume decreases as @xmath78 decreases .",
    "this is natural since the dm number density decreases as the universe expands . in the case of the velocity - dependent cross section , however , some non - trivial features appear .",
    "first note that the velocity is estimated as @xmath84 where @xmath85 denotes the temperature at the _",

    "we have taken into account this correction .",
    "below this temperature , a dm particle can not maintain kinetic equilibrium with thermal plasma , and hence it propagates freely and loses its momentum only adiabatically by the hubble expansion .",
    "notice that typical kinetic decoupling temperature for wimp dm is much smaller than the freezeout temperature ( we may say @xmath89 kev ",
    "mev for wimp dm candidates ) @xcite .",
    "thus it is found that , for @xmath87 and @xmath90 , the energy injection ( [ deltarho ] ) is constant , or increases as @xmath78 decreases as long as the velocity dependence is not saturated . in fig.[fig : rhos ] , we plot @xmath91 as a function of time for @xmath55 ( top ) and @xmath57 ( bottom ) .",

    "it is seen that dm annihilation effects suppress the @xmath193 spectrum , reflecting the increase in thickness of the last scattering surface .",
    "it is not hard to imagine that this effect has a degeneracy with other cosmological parameters . in particular , the increase of the reionization optical depth",
    "causes similar effects . in order to derive conservative bounds on the dm annihilation cross section",
    ", we must take into account degeneracies between dm annihilation effect and other cosmological parameters .",
    "we have derived 2@xmath197 constraints using a profile likelihood function where the other cosmological parameters including the six standard ones ( @xmath198 in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the amplitude of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect are marginalized so that the original likelihood function is maximized for given dm annihilation cross section and mass .",
    "the likelihood surface is scanned by using the cosmomc code  @xcite ; in our analysis , we have modified the cosmomc code to take account of the above mentioned effect of energy injection .",
    "the used datasets include wmap  @xcite , acbar  @xcite , cbi  @xcite and quad  @xcite .",
    "as opposed to bbn constraints , cmb constraint depends on the injected radiative energy , hence purely leptonic annihilation is more strongly constrained than the hadronic one .    the result is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmb ] where we plot upper bounds on the annihilation cross section obtained from cmb anisotropy data as a function of dm mass for @xmath199  @xmath200 .",
    "dm is assumed to annihilate into @xmath192 pair in the top panel and @xmath186 in the bottom panel .",
    "here we have taken @xmath55 and @xmath201 .",
    "we have checked that the results do not change for @xmath57 and/or @xmath202 .",
    "this is because the cmb constraint is sensitive to the annihilation rate at around the recombination epoch , @xmath203  ev , and hence the annihilation cross section is already saturated for most interesting range of @xmath51 for both @xmath55 and @xmath57 . comparing them with bbn constraints , it is found that the cmb constraint is severer for the leptonic annihilation case independently of the parameters .    in the case of hadronic annihilation with @xmath204  a few tev ,",
    "the situation is not so simple . for @xmath55 and @xmath93mev",
    ", cmb gives weaker constraint than bbn for @xmath205 , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : bbn_haddh ] , but becomes tighter for @xmath206 .",
    "the situation is similar for @xmath93kev .",
    "this is because the bbn constraint from the observation of d / h is sensitive to the annihilation at @xmath163mev , and the annihilation cross section do not saturate at that epoch for small @xmath51 for @xmath55 . on the other hand , for @xmath57 , bbn gives tighter constraint than the cmb for parameter ranges shown in the figures .",
    "therefore , cmb takes complementary role to bbn in constraining the dm annihilation with velocity - dependent annihilation cross section .     ",
    "dm is assumed to annihilate into @xmath192 pair in the top panel and @xmath186 in the bottom panel .",

    "in this paper we have investigated effects of dm annihilation on bbn and cmb , and derived constraints on the dm annihilation rate , particularly focusing on the case where the annihilation cross section has a velocity - dependent structure .",
    "this is partly motivated by the observations of cosmic - ray positron / electron excesses and their explanations by the dm annihilation contribution .",
    "we phenomenologically parametrized the velocity - dependence of the annihilation cross section and the critical velocity at which such an enhancement saturates , and derived general constraints on them .",
    "our constraints are applicable to known velocity - dependent dm annihilation models , such as the sommerfeld and breit - wigner enhancement scenarios .",
    "these results have been plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : bbn_haddh ]    [ fig : cmb ] by changing the parameters and observation .",
    "therefore readers can read off the allowed parameter regions from those figures in accordance with the intended use .",
    "some comments are in order .",
    "if the dm annihilation is helicity - suppressed , the @xmath115-wave process may be the dominant mode , as is often the case with majorana fermion dm . in this case",
    "we obtain @xmath209 : @xmath210 . thus the annihilation cross section becomes smaller as the temperature decreases , until the @xmath22-wave process becomes efficient . for negative @xmath49 ,",
    "the bbn / cmb constraints are weaker than the velocity - independent case .    in the sommerfeld enhancement scenario ,",
    "it was pointed out that the dm - dm scattering mediated by light particle exchanges causes observationally relevant effect  @xcite , and this also gives significant constraint  @xcite .",
