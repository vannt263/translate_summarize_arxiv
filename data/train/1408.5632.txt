    "can be explained by expanding the above current spreading model , introducing the lmo inter - layers acting as additional scatterers ( figure [ fig : pcs_iv_all ] d - e ) . as no significant dependence on the lmo inter - layer thickness",
    "is seen in the qualitative behavior of the i - v curves , we interpret the current cone as fully spread , i.e. probing a largely increased lsmo / nb : sto interface .",
    "similar symmetric curves are seen when using macro - contacts on unpatterned interfaces @xcite .",

    "this interpretation is corroborated by analyzing the dynamic response of the point contact ; the diodic interface has a large junction capacitance associated with it , identified by a time - lag of the i - v sweeps ( not shown ) .",
    "as the high frequency ac modulation of the current ( added to obtain the dynamic response ) bypasses this capacitance , we can selectively probe the system with and without the diodic contribution to the resistance , as shown in figure [ fig : pcs_dynr ] .",
    "here we compare samples of varying diodic nature at 150 k , and their dynamic resistance both measured with ac modulation , and numerically derived from the i - v curves .",
    "as can be seen , the underlying resistive behavior is non ohmic ; it decreases with increased current and is symmetric around zero bias voltage , although the dc bias voltage mapping is distorted by the diode junction .",

    "this type of resistive dependence on current is often reported in manganite transport studies and is normally interpreted as electro - resistance ( er ) @xcite .",

    "we refer back to figures [ fig : pcs_iv_all ] for i - v characteristics .",
    "all mr values are determined through comparison with the resistance at 800 oe . , width=7 ]    we interpret the high and low amplitude mr to originate from two different mechanisms ; the former stemming from an lsmo / nb : sto interface effect related to the diodicity , and the latter from a more conventional gbmr @xcite or dwmr @xcite .",
    "we base our assignment of two separate contributions to the mr on three observations .",
    "firstly , the significant change in mr magnitude from 150 k to 250 k under reverse bias is non - existent under forward bias ( figure [ fig : mr_norm_summary ] ) .",
    "the i - v characteristics for the flat n=0 sample correlate well with this temperature dependence , that is , the observed change in the ln(i ) data ( not shown ) from 250 k to 150 k through a transition from a wide threshold voltage into a sharper well defined diode threshold voltage at 150 k. secondly , the relative spread of datapoints in the high mr case is small compared to the scattered points in the low mr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mr_norm_summary ] ) .",
    "this corroborates the gb / dw explanation as the proximity to such boundaries will affect the mr value and thus greatly depends on the positioning of the stm tip during measurement . as each contact is done at a more or less random location , a stochastic spread of mr value is expected .",
    "lastly , accompanying the high mr is a substantial magnetic hysteresis of ( @xmath4 170 oe ) which is absent at 300 k. the low mr under forward bias shows little sign of this hysteresis ( figure [ fig : mr_examples ] )    it is important to note that there is an energy dissipation in the system due to the relatively large probe current , and that it may lead to local heating of the films , predominantly in volumes with high energy dissipation close to the point contact .",
    "the low curie temperature allows for us to access how large these effects are in the mr active regions studies here . for both mr",
    "effects discussed here , they are observable with equal probability at the highest temperature , which suggest that heating within these regions is confined to below 40 k. this can be expected since the mr effects are associated with interfaces / domain boundaries located quite far from the point contact .      the summarized low amplitude mr ( figure [ fig : mr_norm_summary ] ) displays a consistent amplitude from 150 to 250 k with a sharp drop at 300 k , and is in accordance with the gb observations for nanometer sized grains @xcite . from the cmr effect normally dominating in single crystals and epitaxial films without gbs @xcite , the opposite temperature dependence is expected as it is connected to the magnetic phase transition and has a maximum at the curie temperature .",
    "thus we disregard cmr as the main contributor to the measured mr .",
    "the sharp switching with a variable hysteresis depending on point contact ( bottom plot figure [ fig : mr_examples ] and [ fig : mr_3figs ] a ) is only observed in the low amplitude mr sweeps is in accordance with a boundary model interpretation . if the tip happens to be placed particularly close to a wall or boundary and the domains on either side are free to flip regardless of the other",
    ", sharp transitions occur .",
    "both grain boundaries and domain walls are known to yield such signatures @xcite . in the absence of sharp switching the low field",
    "mr is still present , which we interpret as an averaged and reduced mr originating from similar processes further away from the tip .    to further elucidate the gb / dw mechanism we compare the sharp mr switching response from a flat ( a ) and a laterally patterned ( b ) film at varying bias currents in figure [ fig : mr_3figs ] .",
    "as opposed to the continuous films , the patterned samples do not display the same background low field mr as the rest of the samples .",
    "this supports the proposed probing of magnetic configuration depending on proximity to tip placement ; for the patterned samples the situation is expected to be more binary ; chances are that either there is a scattering boundary within the confinement or it is not . the crystalline macro - domains in lsmo , which separate the orthogonal twinning orientations @xcite , are of similar size ( @xmath4 500 nm ) as the structures in our patterned samples and thus consistent with our observations .",
    "sharp mr switching signatures from a a ) flat and a b ) laterally patterned film at 150 k for various currents , illustrating the difference in coercive fields and current effects from confined geometries .",
    "the chronology of the measurements for both panels is from bottom to the top .",
    ", width=7 ]    the field dependence of the bulk magnetization is normally reflected in mr curves ; in both polycrystalline samples @xcite and tmr junctions @xcite , the coercive field will coincide with switching fields in the mr data . in our samples , however , it is clear that the mr data obtained with the stm tip does not follow the low field bulk magnetization reversal processes presented in figure [ fig : squid ] , but is shifted to larger fields .",
    "we attribute this discrepancy to the locality of our probing ; as seen in the tail of our 150 k m - h curves ( figure [ fig : squid ] b ) , full saturation is not reached until @xmath4 100 oe and could encompass the regions probed in our mr measurements .",
    "it is also clear that the patterned samples display a significantly wider field range of high resistance than the flat samples ( figure [ fig : mr_3figs ] ) .",
    "this can be assigned to the induced shape anisotropy and effects from edge roughness in the patterned samples @xcite .",
    "similar observations are reported for patterned tmr junctions @xcite .",
    "the lateral confinement is also visible through the current dependence of the mr ( figure [ fig : mr_3figs ] ) . whereas flat films normally yield stable and reversible field dependence with current bias , the switching fields in patterned films are susceptible to the probe current , indicating a spin transfer torque effect @xcite .",
    "such torque alters the energetics of nucleation and motion of domain walls during the switching process , and is manifested as perturbations to the coercive fields . the discrepancy in behavior between flat and patterned films in this respect , we attribute to confinement of current in the latter . typical current densities through our patterned samples",
    "reach @xmath4 10@xmath23 amp/@xmath6 , which are comparable to what is necessary to achieve such transfer @xcite .",
    "we link the high mr observed in the reverse biased diodic sample to transport processes across the measured lsmo / nb : sto schottky barrier . in forward bias above the turn - on voltage ( true for all datapoints acquired for this polarity ) , the schottky barrier is no longer current limiting .",
    "we are thus bypassing the barrier , and probing the field dependence of the bulk lsmo transport just as in the non - diodic n@xmath200 , explaining the identical mr behavior in forward bias for all samples independent of rectifying properties .",
    "however , in opposite voltage polarity ( figure [ fig : mr_examples ] and [ fig : mr_norm_summary ] ) , the schottky barrier is still active , and conduction is mediated by a combination of defect assisted conductance and tunneling .",
    "accompanying the high mr is also a significant magnetic hysteresis , which we attribute to a magnetically altered interface layer known to exist in the manganites @xcite , and the field shift of  170 oe fits well with recent reports @xcite",
    ".    the magnetic order in these altered layers is also reduced at elevated temperatures as compared to bulk lsmo behavior , providing an interpretation of the reduced mr at 300 k. accordingly , we attribute the high amplitude mr and accompanying hysteresis to the interface region .",
    "control of the interface layer and possible defects is thus a key parameter in order to achieve mr in a reverse biased junction .",
    "the exact mechanism for the mr in this region remains unclear , but it is evident that schottky barrier is a necessity for the evolution of this mr , altering the transport channels as well as potential and electron density at the diode interface . it has recently been shown that magnetic systems can be susceptible electric fields ; through ferromagnetic / ferroelectric interface studies the use of ferroelectric barriers have enabled switchable control of spin polarization @xcite and even polarization reversal @xcite in lsmo tmr junctions .",
    "local charge transport has been investigated for flat and lithographically patterned ( lsmo)@xmath8/(lmo)@xmath9/(lsmo)@xmath8 heterostructures ( @xmath24 n @xmath25 ) on nb : sto substrates .",
    "stm based point - contact measurements were used to probe local current - voltage and low field magnetotransport properties .",
    "depending on sample type we observe different contributions from the schottky junction forming at the lsmo / nb : sto interface ; being almost perfect diodic when the current is localized to laterally defined lithographic patterns , while nearly symmetric when probing flat films with an lmo layer inserted .",
    "this is attributed to defects in the interface layer in combination with the increased effective diode area arising from scattering of the local current by the lmo inter - layers .    to the low field",
    "mr we locate two separate contributions , one originating from the lsmo thin film and the other from the diode region , as deduced through analysis of the i - v , ac and dc characteristics .",
    "the thin film contribution is heavily dependent on tip placement , which in our local probe configuration can yield sharp transitions .",
    "we argue that this stems from a proximity dependence on distance from gbs or dws .",
    "in laterally patterned samples we observe current dependence on switching fields , that we attribute to the spin torque effect .    the mr contribution from the interface layer in reverse",
    "bias is always larger and significant ( 1.5 % in at 150 k ) with a magnetic coercivity coinciding with reports of altered interface layers , and is robust over a large range of reverse voltage .",
    "these results are important for the detailed understanding of mr contributions in complex manganite heterostructures and suggest that device area , interface film properties , defect concentration and nature as well as the geometry , can influence the mr within the same system .",
