    "bulk germanium extrinsic photoconductors ( ge pcs ) have been widely used in far - infrared ( far - ir ) astronomical observations in the 50120 @xmath1 m wavelength range  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the spectral response of p - type ge pcs can be extended to longer wavelengths ( @xmath2200 @xmath1 m ) by applying a uniaxial compressive stress @xcite . in order to provide high quantum efficiency , broad spectral response , and low cosmic - ray hitting rates compared to those for the bulk ge pcs , germanium blocked impurity band ( ge bib )",
    "detectors have been developed as next - generation far - ir detectors replacing the bulk ge pcs @xcite .",
    "bib detectors require electrodes with not a transverse but a longitudinal , and thus transparent configuration to obtain high responsivity , because a far - ir absorbing thin layer ( @xmath4 @xmath1 m ) is formed underneath an electrode . and",
    ", the construction of a large - format array for both pcs and bib detectors is indispensable to improve observational efficiency and measurement accuracy .",
    "the array as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] also needs electrodes with the far - ir transparent configuration .",
    "although such transparent electrodes have been applied to ge pc arrays , performance of transparent electrodes is not optimized  ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "the transparent electrode requires high far - ir transmittance , while it must ensure high conductivity and an excellent ohmic contact at temperatures below 4 k. to obtain high far - ir transmittance , a thin layer with a low doping concentration is desirable . on the other hand ,",
    "a low resistivity layer equipped with excellent ohmic contact can be achieved by a degenerately doped ( @xmath5@xmath6 @xmath7 ) , thick , and epitaxially grown ge layer .",
    "thus , the doped ge layer should be epitaxially grown with optimally - controlled doping concentration and thickness .",
    "most commonly used technique to fabricate the transparent electrode is ion implantation on one surface of a device . however",
    ", its doping concentration often shows a graded profile .",
    "therefore , the formation of the decreasingly - doped layer as a function of implant depth is inevitable .",
    "such a broad doping profile significantly degrades far - ir transmittance due to photon absorption within the thick - implanted layer by free carriers and doped impurities @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there are few investigations in terms of abruptness for the doping profile .    to improve far - ir transmittance , an alternative process technology with precise control of a doping profile , a doping concentration and a layer thickness should be introduced .",
    "a promising candidate technology is molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) that is an ultra - high - vacuum ( uhv)-based technique for producing high quality epitaxial structures with monomolecular layer ( monolayer ) thickness control .",
    "mbe technology allows us to accurately control doping profiles , doping concentrations , and interfaces , thanks to the lower growth rate and temperature compared to other epitaxial growth technologies such as liquid phase epitaxy . in this paper",
    ", we show the properties of the far - ir transparent electrode fabricated by the mbe technology .",
    "in this section , we search optimized solutions for the doping concentration @xmath8 and the layer thickness @xmath9 , considering the following requirements : high far - ir transmittance , low resistivity , and excellent ohmic contact .",
    "note that we assume all the dopants are electrically activated ; @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is activated doping concentration .",
    "the far - ir transmittance @xmath12 through a sample is defined as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are intensities of incident and transmitted far - ir light , respectively .",
    "we consider two samples ; sample-1 is a non - doped ge wafer with a doped ge layer , while sample-2 is a non - doped ge wafer without a doped ge layer .",
    "hereafter , we call the relative transmittance between the two samples @xmath16 as the far - ir transmittance of the doped ge layer @xmath17 .",
    "we require @xmath18 at @xmath19 k and @xmath20 @xmath1 m . to calculate @xmath17 , we take into account the free - carrier absorption and photoionization processes in the doped ge layer with multiple refraction at the doped layer based on @xcite .",
    "they presented a theoretical analysis of the far - ir transmittance through ion - implanted ge samples taking into account free - carrier absorption in the doped ge layer with its impurity concentration range of @xmath21 @xmath7 . in their analysis",
    ", they introduced an absorption parameter @xmath22 in the fresnel coefficients to calculate the transmittance from the vacuum to the non - doped ge medium through the doped ge layer and the reflectance from the doped ge layer surface  ( see fig .  4 of * ? ? ? * ) . in our calculation , to include the photoionization process , the absorption parameter is redefined as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are a photoabsorption coefficient , the complex refractive index of ge , and the speed of light , respectively ; @xcite case corresponds to the case of @xmath27 .",
    "the photoabsorption coefficient is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a photoionization cross - section of a dopant .",
    "the complex refractive index depends on the infrared conductivity @xmath30 = @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the dc conductivity and a single relaxation time , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the layer thickness and doping concentration at @xmath17=0.95 are calculated by considering the dc conductivity dependence on impurity concentration at 4 k in @xcite and @xmath29 assumed to be 10@xmath34 @xmath35 @xcite . as a result , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , smaller thickness and lower doping concentration than those on the solid line are required to achieve @xmath36 .",
    "the requirement for the resistivity is that the resistance of the doped ge layer ( @xmath37 ) is much lower than that of a ge pc pixel ( @xmath38 ) for a voltage drop to become negligible at the layer .",
    "the requirement is particularly stringent for the large - format array to uniformly apply a detector bias voltage to pixels . here",
    ", we consider an @xmath39-pixel array that has the same electrode configuration as that in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ; the array has a common doped ge layer for the pixels .",
    "a common metal electrode is formed on the doped ge layer of pixels on the outermost circumferential sides . at the central pixel of the array , which is farthest from the metal electrode ,",

    "the experimental relation between @xmath43 and @xmath8 is obtained from @xcite . the dashed line in fig .  [ fig2 ]",
    "is derived from the above equation on condition that @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are @xmath48 @xmath3 cm @xcite , @xmath49 cm , and 128 , respectively .      to make an ohmic contact , a contact resistance @xmath50 needs to be sufficiently small compared with @xmath38 .",

    ", higher doping concentration is required .",
    "also , the thickness of the doped ge layer should be larger than that of the depletion width @xmath57 due to the metal / ge contact .    as a typical pixel of ge pcs , @xmath38",
    "is estimated to be @xmath58 @xmath3 by using @xmath46 and @xmath45 at 4 k. under the tunneling process , the specific contact resistance ( @xmath59 ) depends strongly on @xmath11 , the carrier effective mass ( @xmath60 ) , and the barrier height ( @xmath61 ) , but virtually independent of temperature  @xcite . based on @xmath59 for a metal / n - type ge contact measured by @xcite ( @xmath62 @xmath3 @xmath63 for @xmath64 @xmath7 and @xmath65 ev ) , by applying effective masses of hole and electron  ( 0.2  @xmath54 , * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , we obtain @xmath69 @xmath3 by dividing @xmath59 by @xmath70 , which is much lower than @xmath38 ; the condition of @xmath71 is satisfied for @xmath68 @xmath7 .    in the case of @xmath71 , which means a voltage drop at",

    "[ fig2 ] , the dash - dotted line corresponds to the condition of @xmath75 for the al / ge contact .",
    "from the above three requirements , the enclosed area by the three lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows optimized solutions for the fabrication of the far - ir transparent electrode for ge pcs .",
    "our mbe system is built inside a growth chamber , and contains effusion cells for source materials , a substrate holder and heater , a pumping system to achieve uhv ( @xmath76@xmath77 torr ) , liquid n@xmath78 cyropanels , and in - situ analysis tools : a reflection high energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) gun and a mass spectrometer .",
    "a rheed pattern on a screen and its brightness are measured by a ccd camera .",
    "the source ge was prepared from a non - doped ge ingot with a resistivity of 4951 @xmath3  cm , which means that its impurity concentration is much less than the room - temperature intrinsic carrier concentration in ge ( @xmath79 @xmath7 ) . as for a dopant , since the non - doped ge shows a p - type conduction below @xmath80 k by hall effect measurements , the dopant is selected from p - type materials for ge ; we chose aluminum ( al , 6n purity ) .",
    "crucibles for ge and al are pyrolytic boron nitride ( pbn ) .",
    "the effusion cell temperature for ge is set to be 1250 c at which we observe the ge beam flux of @xmath81 @xmath35 sec@xmath82 .",
    "since the fraction of electrical activation of al in ge is @xmath83 % for our mbe system ( @xmath84 ) , the target al doping concentration @xmath85 is 45@xmath86 @xmath7 to give wider acceptable range in thickness ( see fig .",

    "we prepared a mirror - polished ge(100 ) substrate ( @xmath88 mm@xmath89 ) with thickness of 300 @xmath1 m , which was obtained from the non - doped ge ingot .",
    "the substrate was degreased in methanol with ultrasonic for 10 min .",
    "after degreasing , the substrate was ultrasonically rinsed in deionized water ( 18 m@xmath3  cm ) for 10 min to dissolve the native ge oxide and then ( i ) dipped into hf ( 49 % hf : h@xmath78o = 1:3 ) solution for 10 min .",
    "after the process , ( ii ) the substrate was blown dry in dry n@xmath78 and then exposed to 8 mw @xmath35 of radiation from a uv hg arc lamp ( @xmath90 nm ) in air for 10 min to remove carbon ( c ) atoms and grow a fresh ge oxide layer .",
    "then we repeated processes ( i ) and ( ii ) but with duration time of 70 min with uv irradiation .",
    "the cleaned substrate was immediately introduced through a load lock into a uhv chamber . prior to mbe growth , we checked carbon coverage of the substrate surface by x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) analysis . by measuring intensities of ge3d and c1s xps lines ,",
    "carbon coverage is estimated to be 0.08 monolayers that corresponds to the value for the hf treatment method in @xcite .",
    "after the xps analysis , the substrate was loaded into the mbe chamber .",
    "the chamber base pressure was @xmath91 torr , and increased by up to @xmath92 torr .",
    "the substrate was heated at 600 c to remove the ge oxide layer .",
    "the heating process was stopped when brightness contrast between a diffraction spot and a diffuse component on the rheed screen was maximum .",
    "finally , an al - doped ge layer was grown on the front side of the substrate for 3 hours . during the growth ,",
    "when we confirmed the change of a rheed pattern from 3d to 2d growth mode , the substrate temperature was set to be 500 c from 600 c. the processed sample was cut into two pieces for providing samples for optical and electrical measurements .",
    "far - ir transmittances of sample-1 and -2 were measured at 4 k by using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy .",
    "geometries of the two samples are summarized in table  [ table1 ] . to cool them down to 4 k ,",
    "the samples were installed into a cryostat in which there are a wheel to rotate the samples in and out of the beam , a si bolometer detector , and a preamplifier .",
    "far - ir transmittance measurements for both samples were performed by measuring this transmission relative to that of a blank aperture .",
    "the reproducibility of the measurement was 35 % .    to measure resistivity of the al - doped ge layer formed on the non - doped ge substrate ( sample-1 ) , four - point probe measurements were performed with bias current of 10 @xmath1a at 4 k. since most of carriers in the substrate are trapped into impurity levels and hence the charged impurity atoms are neutralized at 4 k ( carrier freeze - out )",
    ", the resistivity of the substrate is expected to be much higher than that of the al - doped ge layer at 4 k. therefore , measured values can be regarded as the resistivity of the al - doped ge layer itself .    the condition that @xmath50 is much lower than @xmath38 should be satisfied to make an ohmic contact . if not ( @xmath93 ) , current - voltage ( @xmath94-@xmath95 ) curves show schottky diode behavior . in oder to investigate @xmath94-@xmath95 curves , we prepared sample-3 , an al layer with thickness of 0.2",
    "@xmath1 m was formed on the al - doped ge layer ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the al and al - doped ge layers were then electrically split into two parts by chemical etching . by using the two metal contact pads",

    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the thickness of the al - doped ge layer is 0.22 @xmath1 m . the al doping concentration of @xmath97 @xmath7 is within the range of the target values , whose variation is 20 % ( @xmath98 ) in the depth range of 0.02 to 0.18 @xmath1 m .",
    "activated doping concentration is measured by a spread resistance analysis at 300 k , and is @xmath83 % of the al doping concentration .",
    "the large variation around the depth of 0.2 @xmath1 m seems to be caused by the change in the substrate temperature from 600 c to 500 c ; higher substrate temperature increases the rate of al re - evaporation from the substrate surface and thus decreases its concentration .",
    "the local peak of the al concentration at the depth of 0.210.23 @xmath1 m indicates the growth interface .    at the growth interface",
    ", the profile shows an exponential decrease with the scale length of @xmath99 @xmath1 m , which is about an order of magnitude lower than that obtained from the ion - implantation technology @xcite . in our mbe system",

    "polarized raman spectroscopy in the @xmath100 scattering configuration was applied to investigate the crystal structure of the al - doped ge layer . for ge(100 ) , if @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 axises are set to be [ 100 ] , [ 010 ] , and [ 001 ] , respectively , the raman line intensity should be minimum at the angle of 0between the [ 100 ] axis and the light polarization and maximum at the angles of @xmath10445 .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows dependence of the raman line intensity on the angle for the al - doped ge layer ( filled circle ) and the non - doped ge substrate ( open circle ) .",
    "the results confirm that the al - doped ge layer is epitaxially grown on the substrate .",

    "the resistivity of the al - doped ge layer is @xmath110 @xmath3 cm at 4 k , which is consistent with that of p - type ge with @xmath111 @xmath7 @xcite . although the resistivity of the al - doped ge layer is much higher than that of an ion - implanted layer ( @xmath112 @xmath3 cm , * ? ? ?",

    "in particular , in the inset that shows the @xmath94-@xmath95 curves within the range of @xmath116 mv , they show excellent symmetry and a linear dependence as indicated by the best - fit linear regression lines .",
    "the @xmath94-@xmath95 curves exhibit that a linear ohmic dependence at lower voltage is followed by nonlinear increase in slope at higher voltage .",
    "these properties are typical @xmath94-@xmath95 curves obtained for pure ge crystals  ( @xmath117 @xmath7 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to further confirm that the @xmath94-@xmath95 curves come from the electrical characteristic of the non - doped ge , we investigate the relation between the current and temperature . under low temperatures ,",
    "the non - doped ge is known to show p - type conduction that is attributed to residual gallium ( ga ) .",
    "since ga acceptors in ge have the binding energy @xmath118 of 10.8 mev , the current is expected to increase with temperature in proportion to exp(@xmath119 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows the dependence of the current on the inverse of temperature at @xmath95=100 mv . at higher temperatures ,",
    "the current exponentially increases with @xmath120 as indicated by the dashed line .",
    "therefore , the result shows that the electrical characteristics are dominated by those of the non - doped ge implying that an excellent ohmic contact ( @xmath121 ) is realized below @xmath122 k.    however , @xmath94-@xmath95 curves within the temperature range of 1020 k clearly show asymmetry around @xmath115 mv as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) .",
    "because the resistivity of the non - doped ge exponentially decreases as temperature increases from 4 k to 10 k , the ohmic contact condition for an electrode seems to be broken ( @xmath123 ) . in this condition ,",
    "@xmath94-@xmath95 curves should be asymmetric . here",
    ", we regard an equivalent circuit for one of the al / ge contacts as a circuit that consists of a schottky diode and a resistance connected in parallel ; the equivalent circuit for the other al / ge contact is considered to be a resistance .",
    "the theoretical @xmath94-@xmath95 curve expected from the equivalent circuit model shows the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) and fits the measured data .",
    "the result means one of the al / ge contacts is not the ohmic contact condition at @xmath124 k.    from the fact that @xmath125 at @xmath126 k , we can roughly estimate the specific contact resistance . by using the measured resistivity ( @xmath210 @xmath3 cm ) of the non - doped ge at 10 k and considering the structure geometry of sample-3 , @xmath38 ( @xmath127 )",
    "is roughly estimated to be @xmath128 @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the specific contact resistance is @xmath129 @xmath3 @xmath63 by multiplying @xmath50 with the area of the metal electrode ( 0.16 @xmath63 ) . under the tunneling process through a schottky barrier ( @xmath130 )",
    ", the specific contact resistance is less sensitive to temperature @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath131 @xmath3 @xmath63 can also be applied at temperatures below 10 k and is roughly in agreement with the expected value of @xmath59(@xmath132 @xmath3 @xmath63 ) obtained from eq.([eq2 ] ) with @xmath133 @xmath7 and @xmath134 ev .",
