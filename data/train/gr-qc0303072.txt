    "traditionally , quantum cosmology has been studied in simple models which have been obtained by a classical reduction of general relativity to a system of finitely many degrees of freedom and a subsequent application of quantum mechanical methods @xcite .",
    "a corresponding full quantum theory of gravity , let alone a relation of the models to it , has remained unknown beyond a purely formal level .",
    "the most important question for quantum cosmology , whether or not classical singularities are absent , has not been answered positively in this approach . instead , the classical singularity has been removed by hand and substituted with some proposals of intuitive initial conditions @xcite .",
    "the situation has changed , however , with the advent of quantum geometry ( also called loop quantum gravity , see @xcite ) , a consistent canonical quantization of full general relativity .",
    "it is possible to derive cosmological models in a way analogous to the full theory @xcite yielding loop quantum cosmology @xcite . in this reduction ,",
    "the main departure from the traditional approach is the prediction that quantum riemannian geometry has a discrete structure .",
    "the effects caused by the discreteness are most important at small volume implying that the structure close to the classical singularity is very different from that of a wheeler ",
    "dewitt quantization which fails to resolve the singularity problem in this regime . at large volume , however , the discreteness leads only to small corrections and the traditional approach is reproduced as an approximation .",
    "therefore , the main new results of loop quantum cosmology affect the behavior at small volume : there is no singularity @xcite , initial conditions for the wave function of a universe follow from the evolution equation @xcite , and the approach to the classical singularity is modified by non - perturbative effects which imply an inflationary period @xcite .",
    "from the point of view of initial conditions , the situation looks closest to dewitt s original proposal presenting , however , a well - defined generalization to other models @xcite .",
    "so far all of these results have been derived and studied in detail in the flat isotropic model only because a non - vanishing intrinsic curvature leads to effects which complicate the loop quantization .",
    "recently , the methods of loop quantum cosmology have been extended to homogeneous models with non - vanishing intrinsic curvature @xcite such that now also a consistent quantization of the closed isotropic model is available .",
    "since the traditional results have all been derived for the closed model only , it is more important to compare with the effects of loop quantum cosmology for that model .",
    "the general qualitative results mentioned above remain true for the closed model , but some of them can be different quantitatively .",
    "for instance , we will see that the dynamical initial conditions resemble the no - boundary proposal more closely than the tunneling proposal .",
    "this observation might appear negative because the no - boundary proposal is widely perceived as being unsupportive to large initial values of an inflaton field needed for a sufficient amount of inflation . here , however , we have an alternative inflationary scenario based on the modified approach to classical singularities which is also realized in the closed model .",
    "but due to the intrinsic curvature the inflationary period does not necessarily extend to arbitrarily small values of the scale factor which could lead to insufficient inflation . as a new possibility we will therefore look at the closed isotropic model as embedded in the anisotropic bianchi ix model .",
    "this leads to additional quantum modifications of intrinsic curvature terms and of the classical behavior , implying a second period of inflation at very small volume . with this more general quantization",
    "the inflationary picture of the closed model is more complicated but comparable to that of the flat model .",
    "quantum geometry and loop quantum cosmology are based on connection and densitized triad variables @xcite which in the isotropic case @xcite are given by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , where @xmath2 is the extrinsic curvature and the parameter @xmath3 represents the intrinsic curvature with values @xmath4 for the flat model and closed model respectively .",
    "both variables are canonically conjugate : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the gravitational constant and @xmath7 is the barbero ",
    "immirzi parameter @xcite which is a positive real number and labels classically equivalent formulations .",
    "the relation to the better known adm variables is given by @xmath8 ( extrinsic curvature ) and @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the scale factor .",
    "since a triad can have two different orientations , its isotropic component @xmath1 can take both signs .",
    "the dynamics is governed by the hamiltonian constraint @xcite @xmath11 or in terms of the extrinsic curvature @xmath12 which in the form of the constraint equation @xmath13 with the matter hamiltonian @xmath14 yields the usual friedmann equation @xmath15    in quantum geometry holonomies of the connection together with flux variables associated with the densitized triad are promoted to basic operators .",
    "one usually works in the connection representation where states are functionals on the infinite - dimensional space of connections via holonomies . after reducing to isotropic variables only one gauge invariant",
    "connection component @xmath16 remains and states in the connection representation are functions of this single parameter .",
    "an orthonormal basis is given by the states @xmath17 labeled by an integer @xmath18 .",
    "the states @xmath19 are eigenstates of the basic derivative operator @xmath20 which quantizes the isotropic triad component @xmath21 where the planck length @xmath22 appears .",
    "we will later mainly use the volume operator which also has the states @xmath19 as eigenstates : @xmath23 composite operators will be constructed from the volume operator together with multiplication operators @xmath24    an example is presented by the inverse scale factor operator which is needed , e.g. , in order to quantize the kinetic part of matter hamiltonians .",
    "since the triad and volume operators have a discrete spectrum containing the value zero , they do not have a densely defined inverse which would be necessary for a well - defined operator .",
    "however , there are methods in quantum geometry @xcite which allow the classically divergent inverse scale factor to be turned into a well - defined operator @xcite . to that end",
    ", one has to rewrite it classically as , e.g. , @xmath25 using the symplectic structure . on the right hand side an inverse of the volume",
    "does not appear anymore , and it can easily be quantized by using the multiplication operators ( [ cos ] ) , ( [ sin ] ) , the volume operator ( [ vol ] ) , and turning the poisson bracket into a commutator . as a result ,",
    "the classical divergence of @xmath26 , which is also present in wheeler ",
    "dewitt quantizations where @xmath10 simply becomes a multiplication operator , is cut off at small volume and the inverse scale factor operator is finite .",
    "we also note that rewriting a classical quantity in the way above introduces new possibilities for quantization ambiguities .",
    "for instance , we wrote the connection component @xmath16 as an exponential which can appear with an arbitrary integer power .",
    "this integer determines at which volume the classical divergence is cut off @xcite , an effect which will be used and discussed in more detail later .",
    "another example for a composite operator which can be built from the volume and multiplication operators is the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "we first recall the result in the flat isotropic case where methods used in the full theory @xcite lead to the constraint operator @xcite @xmath27 with action @xmath28 as usual , the constraint equation @xmath29 turns into an evolution equation after transforming to a triad representation . in a triad representation the state @xmath30",
    "is represented by the coefficients @xmath31 which appear in a decomposition of the state @xmath32 in terms of triad eigenstates @xmath19 . here",
    ", we also write the dependence of the wave function on a matter value @xmath33 which we do not need to specify further for our purposes . the matter hamiltonian @xmath34 acts on the @xmath33-dependence of the state , but via metric components also on the gravitational part with label @xmath18 .",
    "since the triad has discrete spectrum in loop quantum cosmology , the evolution equation is a difference equation in the discrete internal time @xmath18 , rather than a second order differential equation as in a wheeler ",
    "dewitt quantization .",
    "still , for large volume @xmath35 and small extrinsic curvature the difference equation can be well approximated by a differential equation such that the wheeler ",
    "dewitt approach and thus the semiclassical limit is reproduced at large volume @xcite . at small volume close to the classical singularity , however , there are large corrections which must not be ignored .    in the flat model",
    "as discussed above , the intrinsic curvature is always zero such that small extrinsic curvature at large volume implies small total curvature and we expect almost classical behavior . in the closed model , on the other hand , the intrinsic curvature represented by the parameter @xmath36 is constant and never small . a general consistent loop quantization of homogeneous models @xcite can be obtained by subtracting @xmath3 from the connection component @xmath16 such that we obtain the constraint operator @xmath37 with action @xmath38 transforming to the triad representation results in the difference equation @xmath39 where the reduced matter hamiltonian @xmath40 defined by @xmath41 acts only on the @xmath33-dependence of the wave function .",
    "one can easily check that it is possible to evolve through the classical singularity at @xmath42 in the same way as in the flat case @xcite ; thus , the singularity is absent in the loop quantization .    in order to derive a continuum approximation at large volume we have to find a continuous wave function @xmath43 related to the discrete wave function @xmath31 which does not vary strongly at small scales and",
    "solves an approximating differential equation derived from ( [ diff ] ) . since",
    "a good continuum limit is a prerequisite for a correct classical limit , a wave function allowing such an interpolation is called pre - classical @xcite . in the flat case",
    "the wave function @xmath44 itself turned out to lead to the pre - classical solutions , while general considerations show that this can not be the case in the presence of large intrinsic curvature @xcite .",
    "in this case the wave function @xmath45 with coefficients @xmath46 where the phase factor cancels small - scale oscillations in @xmath44 has to be used for a continuum limit . as in @xcite for the flat case it",
    "can then be verified that the approximating differential equation for @xmath35 is @xmath47 where @xmath43 is an interpolation of the pre - classical @xmath48 .",
    "the left hand side can be written as @xmath49 which shows that the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation as a schrdinger - like quantization of ( [ friedmann ] ) is reproduced at large volume .",
    "the ordering is fixed in ( [ wdw ] ) and follows from the non - singular difference equation of loop quantum cosmology . for de sitter space with cosmological constant @xmath50",
    "we obtain the general solution @xmath51 in terms of airy functions .",
    "the wave function @xmath52 is either zero in @xmath53 , if and only if @xmath54 , or diverges there .",
    "when we approach the classical singularity at @xmath42 by going to smaller values of @xmath18 , we have to take into account discrepancies between the wheeler  dewitt equation and the difference equation of loop quantum cosmology . as a difference equation , the exact constraint equation ( [ diff ] )",
    "can be used as a recurrence relation which determines the wave function starting from initial values at some finite positive values of @xmath18 .",
    "we can find values @xmath44 for smaller @xmath18 as long as the coefficient @xmath55 of lowest order in ( [ diff ] ) does not vanish .",
    "however , it does vanish if and only if @xmath56 such that we can not fix @xmath57 in this way . as in @xcite",
    "this does not mean that there is a singularity because we can evolve through @xmath42 and find all values of the wave function for negative internal time @xmath18 .",
    "but the part of the constraint equation for @xmath56 has to be satisfied .",
    "instead of fixing @xmath58 in terms of the initial data , it implies a linear relation between @xmath59 and @xmath60 which have already been determined in previous steps of the recurrence .",
    "therefore , the constraint equation imposes implicitly a linear consistency condition on the initial data which serves as an initial condition .",
    "since it is not imposed separately but follows from the evolution equation , it is called a dynamical initial condition @xcite .",
    "note that it only gives us partial information and does not fix the wave function completely in the presence of matter fields .    while the value @xmath58 of the wave function at the classical singularity is undetermined",
    "and it thus is impossible to formulate the dynamical initial conditions as conditions at @xmath42 , they imply effectively that a pre - classical wave function has to approach zero close to @xmath42 . in this sense",
    ", it is similar to dewitt s initial condition which requires the wave function to vanish at the classical singularity .",
    "in contrast to that condition , however , the dynamical initial condition is well - posed in the discrete context ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    for the closed model we can",
    "now also compare the dynamical initial condition with other traditional proposals , most importantly the no - boundary @xcite and the tunneling proposal @xcite , which have been discussed only in this case . to do that we first consider the approximate differential equation for the hamiltonian constraint ( [ wdw ] ) and rewrite it in terms of the scale factor @xmath10 and in the `` de sitter '' approximation where the scalar field potential is approximated by a ( cosmological ) constant @xmath61 and the scalar field dependence is ignored @xmath62         a \\psi(a ) = 0 \\,.\\ ] ] this represents an ordering of the hamiltonian constraint that has not previously been considered ( compare , e.g. , the general analysis in @xcite ) .",
    "if we write @xmath63 we see that in order for @xmath64 to be bounded for small @xmath10 we demand that @xmath65 approach zero . for @xmath66",
    "the solution to ( [ desitter ] ) satisfying @xmath67 is @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the modified bessel function and @xmath70 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "when matched to the wkb solutions in the exponential region , this solution picks out the exponentially increasing wkb mode thus resembling the no - boundary wave function .",
    "we note however , that in the limit of small @xmath10 @xmath64 approaches zero satisfying dewitt s initial condition .    the previous analysis in terms of @xmath71 shares the same flaws of the traditional approach to quantum cosmology in that conditions on the wave function are specified near the classical singularity where we might expect to see large corrections due to the effects of discrete space . the evolution equation ( [ diff ] ) needs to be solved in order to determine if the discrete effects modify the analysis .",
    "since the dynamical initial condition forces the discrete wave function to approach zero for small @xmath10 , the wave function increases for growing @xmath10 before it starts to oscillate .",
    "similarly to the previous analysis , the wave function exponentially increases in the classically forbidden region . a numerical solution to ( [ diff ] ) with a cosmological constant exhibits this behavior ( fig .  [ wavefunc ] ) reinforcing the previous analysis and indicating that the dynamical initial condition imposes conditions similar to the no - boundary proposal .     of the discrete equation ( [ diff ] )",
    "compared to a solution @xmath72 of the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation ( [ wdw ] ) such that @xmath73 is regular at @xmath53 ( solid line ) corresponding to de sitter space with @xmath74.,width=453,height=302 ]",
    "it has been speculated that the no - boundary proposal does not predict large enough initial values for an inflaton field which suggests that a sufficient amount of inflation can not be realized @xcite .",
    "if correct , the same conclusion would apply for a wave function satisfying the dynamical initial condition .",
    "however , loop quantum cosmology presents an alternative mechanism of inflation @xcite which does not necessarily require an inflaton field .",
    "this scenario exploits quantum modifications of the classical equations of motion implied by the discrete formulation .",
    "there are several types of corrections , but we can focus on the non - perturbative effect which results from a quantization of inverse metric components since it implies the most drastic changes .",
    "the effect contains an ambiguity parameter and by choosing it to be large the non - perturbative modification extends into the semiclassical regime . the wave function",
    "can then be approximated as a wave packet following the effective classical equations of motion which we will discuss now .",
    "eigenvalues of a density operator @xmath75 , which quantizes the classical density @xmath76 in the kinetic part of a matter hamiltonian , can be computed explicitly @xcite for arbitrary values of the ambiguity parameter @xmath77 which is a half - integer .",
    "here we only need an approximate expression for the eigenvalues @xmath78 where the function @xmath79 approaches one at large values but incorporates non - perturbative corrections for small @xmath80 . in effective classical equations of motion",
    "the modified density will appear as a continuous function @xmath81 derived using @xmath82 .",
    "the precise form of the behavior for small @xmath10 is subject to quantization ambiguities , but qualitatively it always has the above form .",
    "additionally , the power of @xmath10 in the small-@xmath10 approximation is usually high as in the example used here",
    ".    in particular , @xmath83 and @xmath84 increases as a function of @xmath10 at small volume in contrast to the classical divergence .",
    "consequently , the effective matter hamiltonian , e.g. , @xmath85 for a scalar , always satisfies @xmath86 even taking into account the kinetic term which would diverge classically .",
    "we can view the friedmann equation @xmath87 as describing a classical motion in the effective potential @xmath88 where we ignore the dependence on the matter field . because the modified density is increasing at small @xmath10 just like a potential term , the derivative @xmath89 of the effective potential is negative for small @xmath10 .",
    "the effective classical equation of motion then implies @xmath90 such that the effective classical evolution at small @xmath10 is inflationary . an inflaton field and therefore large initial values",
    "are not required for this kind of inflation which is purely due to quantum geometry effects .",
    "it is , however , necessary that there be a large enough overlap between the region where the effective potential decreases and the classically allowed region where the effective potential is negative . in this intersection",
    "we can use the effective classical equations of motion and obtain an amount of inflation @xmath91 given by the initial scale factor @xmath92 where the classically allowed region starts and the final scale factor @xmath93 where the modified increasing density goes over into the standard density @xmath76 . for the flat model , the entire region of positive @xmath10",
    "was classically allowed , and @xmath92 can be arbitrarily small , only restricted by the eventual breakdown of the effective classical approximation . in the closed model , however , the non - zero intrinsic curvature leads to a hill in the effective potential at small @xmath10 such that the classically allowed region starts at a positive value of the scale factor . an approximate expression for the ratio @xmath91",
    "can be derived in the case of a free massless scalar field . using the small-@xmath10 approximation of @xmath94 in ( [ dj ] )",
    ", the classical turning point corresponds to where the effective potential equals zero .",
    "this gives @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the conjugate scalar field momentum .",
    "the inflationary regime ends where @xmath97 takes on its maximum value which corresponds to @xmath98 @xcite . for practical values of the parameters",
    "the inflationary region is small and getting large amounts of inflation would require large values of @xmath96 .      with the quantization of the closed model presented so far it is hard to get a large amount of inflation because the intrinsic curvature introduces a potential hill which prohibits the scale factor from attaining very small values classically .",
    "the divergence of the kinetic part of matter hamiltonians , which could cancel the potential hill , is cut off by quantum geometry effects .",
    "since the inverse scale factor in isotropic cosmologies is related to the extrinsic curvature , this can also be interpreted as an extrinsic curvature cut - off . because intrinsic and extrinsic curvature belong to the same geometrical object in a covariant treatment",
    ", one could expect that there is a similar effect which suppresses the intrinsic curvature represented by the spin connection @xmath36 .",
    "this can in fact be realized by viewing the closed isotropic model as being embedded in the anisotropic bianchi ix model .",
    "an anisotropic model has three independent triad components @xmath99 which determine the intrinsic curvature via the spin connection @xmath100 and analogous components @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( for bianchi ix , @xcite ) . the isotropic model can be obtained by fixing @xmath103 such that @xmath104 .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint of the bianchi ix model @xcite requires a quantization of the spin connection which has to be a well - defined operator .",
    "since the components @xmath105 contain inverse powers of the triad , we have to use inverse triad operators introducing another ambiguity parameter @xmath106 which can be different from the parameter @xmath107 used when quantizing the density @xmath108 appearing in a scalar matter hamiltonian . after reducing the quantized bianchi ix spin connection to isotropy we obtain , with @xmath109 of ( [ p ] ) , eigenvalues @xmath110 replacing @xmath36 in the constraint equation .",
    "when @xmath18 is small , the effective inverse triad components decrease such that @xmath111 becomes smaller than @xmath112 for small volume and approaches zero at the classical singularity . for @xmath113",
    "we have @xmath114 .",
    "in fact , we do have a suppression of intrinsic curvature just as the extrinsic curvature is suppressed .",
    "( @xmath10 in multiples of the planck length ) for a massless scalar with zero potential and a cosmological constant @xmath115 .",

    "the potential continues to decrease since the cosmological constant term dominates .",
    "the dashed lines are the effective potential without @xmath3-suppression and kinetic term ( approaching one for @xmath119 ) , and without @xmath3-suppression and with a standard kinetic term ( which diverges for @xmath119).,width=453,height=302 ]    as a consequence , the potential hill in the effective potential shrinks because the intrinsic curvature term which equaled one before is not constant anymore and approaches zero : @xmath120 rather than one ( see fig .",
    "[ effpot ] ) , where @xmath121 and @xmath122    the presence of a matter potential then leads to a small classically allowed region between @xmath119 and some positive value ( see fig .",
    "[ effpotsmall ] ) because the potential term increases faster than the suppression in the intrinsic curvature term owing to the large power in the small-@xmath10 approximation ( [ dj ] ) .",
    "initially , the effective potential decreases implying an inflationary epoch . after some time , the increasing @xmath3 will start to dominate the effective potential which terminates inflation .",
    "when @xmath3 increases such that the effective potential reaches positive values , the classically allowed region ends and a potential hill emerges which has to be tunneled through by the wave function . after the hill , we have the second phase of inflation already observed above which usually will only last for a small number of @xmath123-foldings .",
    "however , the first phase of inflation can start at values of the scale factor arbitrarily close to zero such that the amount of inflation can be very high just as in the flat case .     in the small-@xmath10",

[ wavegamlog ] ) .    ) . in the classically forbidden region",

    "a central problem with the standard big bang ( sbb ) proposal is the ` horizon problem ' in which the comoving region observed by the cosmological microwave background ( cmb ) is larger than the comoving forward light cone at the recombination time @xmath128 thus implying regions of the cmb out of causal contact . the forward light cone @xmath129 is given by @xmath130 we consider matter in the form of a scalar field and the friedmann equation becomes @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the conjugate momentum to the scalar field and @xmath3 is the spin connection .",

    "given that the amount of inflation is small for the closed model in this region , it would require very large values for @xmath96 to overcome the horizon problem .",

    "we have shown that with @xmath3-suppression , the closed model behaves similarly to the flat model in the small @xmath10 limit .",

    "equations of motion can be derived from the hamiltonian which for a scalar has the effective form @xmath159 this yields @xmath160 and @xmath161 resulting in the second order equation of motion @xmath162 with the hubble parameter @xmath163 . in the standard case @xmath164 , we have @xmath165 and the first order term serves as a friction which leads to slow roll for a sufficiently flat potential . for the modified @xmath84 at small volume , however , @xmath84 increases and thus @xmath166 is positive . in this case , the friction term has the opposite sign and forces the scalar to move up the potential ( see fig .  [ slowroll ] , whose initial values have been chosen for the purpose of illustration ; one can easily achieve larger maximal values of @xmath33 by using a larger initial @xmath167 ) .",
    "( top ) and scalar @xmath33 ( bottom ) in planck units with a mass term @xmath168 .",
    "the first phase of quantum geometry inflation ( which ends at @xmath169 ) leads to large initial @xmath33 for a second phase of slow roll inflation ( with @xmath117 and initial values @xmath170 , @xmath171 at @xmath172 such that @xmath173).,title=\"fig:\",width=453,height=226 ]   ( top ) and scalar @xmath33 ( bottom ) in planck units with a mass term @xmath168 .",
    "the first phase of quantum geometry inflation ( which ends at @xmath169 ) leads to large initial @xmath33 for a second phase of slow roll inflation ( with @xmath117 and initial values @xmath170 , @xmath171 at @xmath172 such that @xmath173).,title=\"fig:\",width=453,height=226 ]    thus , quantum geometry modifications drive the scalar up the potential during early phases , even if it starts in a minimum , thereby producing large initial values for standard inflation . it remains to be seen whether the standard inflationary phase will wash away any possible signature of the quantum geometry phase , or if it can be distinguished from other scenarios .",
    "we have studied the closed isotropic model in loop quantum cosmology and seen that it reproduces all of the main general results : its evolution is non - singular and it predicts dynamical initial conditions as well as the occurrence of inflation .",
    "the advantage of using the closed model is that we are able to compare with older attempts to understand the quantum dynamics .",
    "in fact , those approaches are reproduced at large volume , but many new properties result at small volume .",
    "the initial conditions , for instance , have a very different origin since they are derived in part from the dynamical law and not imposed by hand .",
    "furthermore , the factor ordering of the constraint is fixed by the requirement of a non - singular evolution .",
    "older attempts have often been plagued by the factor ordering problem because different orderings can lead to qualitatively different results and even invalidate certain proposals @xcite .",
    "still , as in any quantization there are many ambiguities which can be included with certain parameters like @xmath107 .",
    "these ambiguities , however , usually lead only to quantitative differences leaving the main results unchanged .",
    "they can , therefore , be used for a phenomenological analysis .    as for dynamical initial conditions ,",
    "the constraint equation requires the wave function to approach very small values at the classical singularity such that the effect is often similar to dewitt s initial condition .",
    "however , due to effects of the discreteness the initial value problem is well - posed ( which presents some realization of the planck potential of @xcite ) .",
    "the first quantization we used for the closed model is closely related to the no - boundary proposal while it would be different from the tunneling proposal ( we note , however , that we ignored the kinetic term of the matter hamiltonian in ( [ desitter ] ) as usual in this context ; in a more general discussion one can also expect more differences to the no - boundary proposal due to quantum geometry modifications of the kinetic term as in @xcite ) .",
    "however , this quantization does not take into account a possible suppression of intrinsic curvature which can be realized by embedding the isotropic model in the anisotropic bianchi ix model .",
    "this introduces a second ambiguity parameter @xmath106 which influences the results : if @xmath174 , there is no potential hill and the whole region of scale factors between zero and a possible recollapse value is allowed classically . in this case , the closed model is very similar to the flat model at small volume .",
    "otherwise , there will be a potential hill and we have two classically allowed regions . for small @xmath106 ,",
    "the first region is only small and the wave function again resembles that of the no - boundary proposal .",
    "if @xmath106 is increased , the first classically allowed region grows such that the wave function can increase there before it tunnels into the second classically allowed region .",
    "however , the result remains closer to the no - boundary proposal than to the tunneling proposal because the exponentially increasing branch of the wave function will dominate in the classically forbidden region .",
    "still , depending on the values of ambiguity parameters we obtain modifications of the old proposals realizing different aspects of them .",
    "furthermore , the values will influence the amount of inflation achieved within a given model .",
    "we also have to give some cautionary remarks : while the quantization of the flat model can be regarded as being very close to that of the full theory , the closed model requires a special input due to the large intrinsic curvature . in the flat model , the intrinsic curvature vanishes identically , and in the full theory it can be ignored locally .",
    "therefore , it has to be verified that the physical effects are not artifacts of the special techniques but indeed model the full theory .",
    "as we have seen here , viewing a symmetric model as being embedded in a less symmetric one can lead to important effects . in our case , those effects ( @xmath3-suppression ) were welcome and improved the model from the point of view of cosmological model building .",
    "it is certainly a very important issue to investigate a similar , but much more complicated , correspondence between symmetric models and the full theory .",
    "also more complicated models contain many ambiguity parameters whose physical role and reasonable values are not completely clear yet .",
    "still , they provide a rich ground for phenomenology which allows studying the same objects and effects present in the full theory in a much more simplified context .",
