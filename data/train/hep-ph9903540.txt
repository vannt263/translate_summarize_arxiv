    "note that we have to deal , in general , with an arbitrary number of such angles .",

    "decays , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are both vector mesons , and @xmath27 denotes a final - state configuration with cp eigenvalue @xmath28 .",
    "it is convenient to analyse such modes in terms of the linear polarization amplitudes @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "whereas @xmath31 describes a cp - odd final - state configuration , both @xmath29 and @xmath30 correspond to cp - even final - state configurations , i.e.  to the cp eigenvalues @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the observables of the corresponding angular distribution are given by @xmath34 as well as by the interference terms @xmath35 this formalism is discussed in more detail in @xcite , where several explicit angular distributions can be found and appropriate weighting functions to extract their observables in an efficient way from the experimental data are given .    in the following considerations ,",
    "the main role is played by neutral @xmath26_f$ ] decays , where the `` unevolved '' decay amplitudes can be expressed as @xmath36\\label{ampl}\\\\ \\overline{a}_f&=&\\eta_f\\,{\\cal n}_f\\left[1-b_f\\ , e^{i\\rho_f }   e^{-i\\omega}\\right],\\label{ampl - cp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 denotes a cp - violating weak phase and @xmath38 are cp - conserving strong phases . in this case , the observables ( [ obs1 ] ) and ( [ obs2 ] ) allow us to probe the @xmath39@xmath40 mixing phase @xmath41 and the weak phase @xmath37 , as we will show in this paper . concerning practical applications ,",
    "@xmath37 is given by one of the angles of the unitarity triangle .",
    "however , the observables specified in ( [ obs1 ] ) and ( [ obs2 ] ) are not independent from one another and do not provide sufficient information to extract @xmath41 and @xmath37 , as well as the corresponding hadronic parameters , simultaneously . to this end",
    ", we have to use an additional input .    usually , the weak phase @xmath37 is of central interest .",
    "if we fix the mixing phase @xmath41 separately , it is possible to determine @xmath37  and interesting hadronic quantities  as a function of a _ single _ hadronic parameter in a _ theoretically clean _ way . if we determine this quantity , for instance , by comparing @xmath14 with an @xmath9-related mode , all remaining parameters , including @xmath37 , can be extracted .",
    "if we are willing to make more extensive use of flavour - symmetry arguments , it is in principle possible to determine the @xmath39@xmath40 mixing phase @xmath41 as well .",
    "an example for such a strategy is given by the decay @xmath1 , which can be combined with @xmath2 to extract the @xmath3@xmath4 mixing phase @xmath42 and  if penguin effects in the former mode should be sizeable  also the angle @xmath5 of the unitarity triangle .",
    "as an interesting by - product , this strategy allows us to take into account also the penguin effects in the extraction of the @xmath6@xmath7 mixing phase from @xmath2 , which is an important issue for `` second - generation '' @xmath12-physics experiments at hadron machines .",
    "moreover , we may resolve a discrete ambiguity in the extraction of the ckm angle @xmath8 , and may obtain valuable insights into @xmath9-breaking effects .",
    "other interesting applications of the general formalism presented in this paper , involving @xmath10 and @xmath43 decays , are also briefly noted .",
    "as the extraction of @xmath37 with the help of these modes involves `` penguin '' , i.e.  flavour - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) processes and relies moreover on the unitarity of the ckm matrix , it may well be affected by new physics .",
    "in such a case , discrepancies would show up with other strategies to determine this phase , for example with the theoretically clean extractions of @xmath5 making use of pure `` tree '' decays such as @xmath44 . since no fcnc processes contribute to the decay amplitudes of these modes , it is quite unlikely that they  and the extracted value of @xmath5  are significantly affected by new physics .    the outline of this paper is as follows : in section  [ evol ] , the time - dependent observables of the @xmath14 angular distribution are given .",

    "since the meson content of the @xmath49 states is the same whether these result from the @xmath20 or @xmath50 decays , we may use the same generic angles @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 to describe the angular distribution of their decay products . within this formalism",
