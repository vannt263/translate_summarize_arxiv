    "the blend of quantum computation and of topological phases of matter @xcite have led to the idea of topological quantum computation @xcite . in this field , the essential ingredient is the construction of physical systems sustaining exotic excitations known as non - abelian anyons ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "being genuinely nonlocal , these anyons allow for efficient storage and manipulation of quantum information .",
    "indeed , topologically ordered systems @xcite are stable under local perturbations @xcite and hence protected against undesirable effects such as decoherence . however ,",
    "strong enough perturbations , may drive the system to a nontopological phase . in recent years , many works have been devoted to the study of this robustness in microscopic models .",
    "such an issue is difficult to address since one has to deal with two - dimensional interacting quantum systems and the complex nature of the anyonic quasiparticles prevents one from using standard methods .",
    "the goal of the present work is to propose a simple approach that may be considered as a mean - field theory for topological phases . to this end",
    ", we introduce a variational ansatz which can describe topological as well as non topological phases . by construction",
    ", it also matches the exact ground state in some limiting cases .",
    "thus , it aims at qualitatively describing phase diagrams while being quantitatively acceptable .",
    "most models hosting topological quantum order are built as a sum of local commuting projectors ( toric code @xcite , string nets @xcite , ... ) . in lattice gauge theories ,",
    "one often interprets these projectors as operators measuring effective fluxes and charges .",
    "the topologically ordered ground state ( vacuum ) is then defined as the flux - free and charge - free state .",
    "elementary excitations are obtained by locally violating this constraint . in two dimensions ,",
    "excitations are pointlike anyons related by strings and their energy does not depend on their relative position so that topological phases are also called deconfined phases . a natural way to destroy topological order consists in adding a string tension that will drive the system to a confined phase .",
    "the prototypical hamiltonian of such a system can be written @xmath0 where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) are projectors measuring charges ( fluxes ) on vertices ( plaquettes ) of a two - dimensional graph and where @xmath3 is an operator acting on links which induces a string tension . in the following ,",
    "we consider a two - dimensional plane with open boundary conditions so that the ground state is unique in the thermodynamical limit . assuming non - negative couplings , the ground state of @xmath4",
    "is readily written in two limiting cases .",
    "on one hand , in the trivial phase @xmath5 , the ground state is a ( polarized ) product state denoted by @xmath6 , where all links are in the same state . on the other hand , for @xmath7 ,",
    "the ground state is proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "the main idea of our construction is to find a simple variational state that bridges the gap between these two extreme cases .    in this paper , we focus on the string - net model in the honeycomb lattice since it allows one to study a wide variety of topological phases @xcite .",
    "interested readers that are not familiar with this model can find a detailed study of this variational approach in the simpler case of the toric code model in appendix [ app_tcf ] .",
    "the string - net hamiltonian @xcite is a special case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) where the operator @xmath2 favors the zero - flux configuration in plaquette @xmath9 . here",
    ", we only consider states without charge excitation so that the hilbert space is spanned by all link configurations satisfying the so - called branching rules ( stemming from the fusion rules of the considered anyon theory ) .",
    "we thus drop the @xmath10 term in the hamiltonian . for simplicity",
    ", we also restrict our discussion to the string tension term introduced in ref .",

    "to describe the phase transition separating the topological phase from the trivial phase , we introduce the following single - parameter variational state : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is such that .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath19 depends on the total quantum dimension @xmath20 of the theory considered , on  @xmath21 , and on the system size ( see appendix [ app_sn ] ) . once again , the physical insight underlying this ansatz is that @xmath22 is the exact ground state for @xmath23 , while @xmath24 is the exact ground state for @xmath7 .",

    "this factorization property reveals the mean - field character of @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , for abelian theories , @xmath25 can be rewritten as a simple product state in the dual plaquette ( flux ) basis . for illustration ,",
    "let us consider the simplest abelian theory , i.e. , @xmath30 ( @xmath14 ) . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , for this theory , the string - net model with a string tension can be mapped onto the transverse - field ising model on the triangular lattice by setting , where @xmath9 and @xmath31 are plaquettes sharing link @xmath12 . in this dual representation ,",

    "although no such mapping is known for non - abelian theories ( because of the existence of multiple fusion channels ) , the state @xmath25 can still be considered as a mean - field ansatz because of the factorization property  ( [ eq : factorization ] ) . in other words ,",

    "two theories with the same total quantum dimension @xmath20 are thus treated on an equal footing . nevertheless , from high - order series expansions , we know that ,",
    "for instance , @xmath53 and ising theories ( @xmath54 ) have different ground - state energies @xcite .",
    "consequently , it is natural to wonder how these predictions compare with exact results .",

    "another important remark concerns the behavior of the so - called wilson loop operators denoted @xmath62 for a contour @xmath63 enclosing @xmath27 plaquettes and a string of type @xmath64 ( see appendix [ app_sn ] ) . in the deconfined ( confined ) phase",
    ", the expectation value of @xmath62 is expected to scale as the perimeter ( area ) of @xmath63 @xcite .",

    ", one has @xmath68 for any @xmath63 , which can be interpreted as a trivial perimeter law with an infinite characteristic length .",
    "by contrast , in the polarized phase , one has @xmath69 where the characteristic area @xmath70 is readily obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : wilson ] ) .",
    "let us now compare the mean - field predictions with existing results .",
    "as explained above , for the @xmath41 theory ( @xmath71 ) , the model is equivalent to the @xmath42-state potts model in a transverse field on the triangular lattice .",
    "this model is known to display a second - order transition ( ising universality class ) for @xmath72 , and a first - order transition for @xmath73 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "thus , the present mean - field treatment gives the correct order of the transition . in table",
    "[ tab : xc ] , we give the position of the transition point @xmath74 obtained from series expansions and from the present mean - field ansatz .",
    "quantitatively , the difference between the results of both approaches decreases as @xmath75 increases . for the potts model , the mean - field theory",
    "is even known to be exact for large @xmath71 @xcite . in this limit ,",
    "one obtains a first - order transition at @xmath76 . since @xmath46 only depends on @xmath20 , this large-@xmath20 mean - field result",
    "is expected to hold for all theories .    however , for non - abelian theories with finite @xmath20 , the situation is more complex . in two recent studies @xcite , using series expansion and exact diagonalizations ,",
    "it has been claimed that the phase transition for fibonacci and ising theories is second order but the present mean - field approach predicts a first - order transition ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "although none of these methods are exact , we strongly believe that a ( weakly ) first - order scenario is correct .",
    "apart from the mean - field result , this conclusion relies on two observations which have been overlooked .",
    "the first one relies on strong similarities of the ground - state energy series expansions between @xmath43 , fibonacci , and ising theories ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] ) .",
    "in particular , a jump in the first derivative of the ground - state energy per plaquette @xmath78 is observed at the transition .",
    "this jump was considered as an artifact due to a finite - order series in refs .",
    "@xcite . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] , the magnitude of this jump is found to increase with @xmath20 , in agreement with the mean - field result which yields @xmath79 in addition , for @xmath77 , the ( relative ) height of the energy barrier at @xmath80 between the two minima @xmath81 and the local maximum @xmath82 reads @xmath83 in the limit @xmath84 , this relative energy vanishes as , indicating a weakly first - order transition .",
    "such a behavior qualitatively explains why the transition for fibonacci and ising theories has been considered as second order in refs .  @xcite .",
    "the second argument that corroborates this scenario is based on the emergence of bound states in the low - energy spectrum inside the topological phase and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "let us simply mention that such bound states are necessary although not sufficient to induce a first - order transition and they are present for @xmath77 .",
    "the mean - field approximation can also be used to analyze the same model but in the ladder geometry for which several exact results are known @xcite . in this one - dimensional case",
    ", the variational energy is straightforwardly obtained from ( [ eq : gse_var ] ) by merely replacing @xmath85 by @xmath86 . as for the two - dimensional case , the ansatz ( [ eq : state ] ) predicts a second - order transition for @xmath14 and a first - order transition for @xmath77 although , for the ladder , the transition is known to be first order only if @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "thus , the ansatz fails at describing the nature of the transition for @xmath88 , as already known for the potts model @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the position of the mean - field transition point @xmath89 goes to 1 ( self - dual point ) in the large-@xmath20 limit , which is the exact result for any @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "to conclude , we would like to give some possible routes to go beyond the present approach . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the ground state of the string - net model without string tension has been written as a tensor - network state ( tns ) , involving a triple - line structure ( that reduces to a double - line structure for abelian theories ) . following the steps detailed in these works",
    ", the state @xmath25 could be written in the same way .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 would only change the values taken by the tensors .",
    "since @xmath25 already captures semiquantitatively the physics of the transition induced by string tension , it seems reasonable to assume that performing a minimization over all parameters of the tensors should give more precise results .",
    "the first - order nature of the phase transition for @xmath77 should furthermore be favorable to the obtention of accurate results .",
    "tns have already been successfully used to study phase transitions in abelian models @xcite .",
    "however , they have not yet been applied to the more challenging non - abelian models , although the principles for doing so have been laid down @xcite . the technique exhibited in the present paper",
    "can be considered as a first step , even though the tensor - network structure has been bypassed .",
    "let us emphasize that single - parameter tns have already been proposed for @xmath30 models @xcite , but their single - line structure leads to qualitatively wrong results ( first - order transition ) . to solve this problem , gu _",
    "introduced multiparameter double - line tensors @xcite .",
    "it seems that the double - line structure ( or triple - line structure for non - abelian theories ) is crucial since it encodes information about plaquettes that is necessary for an area law in the confined phase .",
    "our single - parameter ansatz supports this conclusion .",
    "let us also stress that tensors must be chosen carefully , in order to allow for topological states @xcite .",
    "for the toric code in a parallel magnetic field , we have shown ( see appendix [ app_tcf ] for a detailed calculation ) that the topological entropy @xcite vanishes for @xmath90 , i.e. , in the polarized phase , but is equal to @xmath91 ( which is equal to @xmath39 since @xmath92 ) for @xmath56 , i.e. , in the topological phase .",
    "we conjecture that the same relations hold for the string - net model , for any theory .",
    "we leave the calculation of the topological entropy , or of other measures @xcite for future works .    the use of tns would furthermore allow one to study other transitions .",
    "for instance , for the fibonacci theory @xcite , the ground state for @xmath23 and @xmath93 is the state  @xmath94 where all links carry a string @xmath95 , namely , a fibonacci anyon .",
    "the transition from the string - net ground state to this state could thus be studied with a variational state @xmath96 .",
    "however , analytical calculations are much harder in this case , so that numerical tns methods would be extremely valuable .",
    "finally , let us mention that it would be interesting to describe excitations in a variational setting and thus to study dynamical properties in the model , as was done in ref .",
    "we hope the present work will trigger such studies .",

    "are all different and form an orthonormal set of states .",
    "it is thus easy to take the partial trace needed to compute the reduced density matrix @xmath266 .",
    "one gets @xmath292 where we did not write as many terms as before to keep things as readable as possible .    to compute @xmath293",

    "a check of the validity of the obtained expression is to compute @xmath326 .",
    "we find that @xmath327 as it should .",
    "note that we have extended the sum over @xmath328 to @xmath329 and have corrected the induced double counting by the prefactor @xmath244 .",

    "when @xmath335 , the second term in the above equation vanishes exponentially fast when @xmath27 grows ( for a generic domain @xmath261 , @xmath263 grows like @xmath336 ) .",
    "one then gets the following behavior of @xmath337 : @xmath338+\\cdots,\\ ] ] where @xmath268 represents terms that vanish when taking the limit @xmath269 . as a consequence",
    ", the topological entropy vanishes when @xmath335 .      as already mentioned , the topological phase ( @xmath253 ) is the deconfined phase of the ising lattice gauge model , in which wilson loops are known to obey a perimeter law  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , in the polarized ( deconfined ) phase , these loops obey an area law . in the toric code model , wilson loop operators @xmath339",
    "can be chosen as a product of @xmath232 operators along a closed contour , which is nothing but the product of all operators @xmath181 surrounded by this contour .",
    "using eq .",

    "the energy is minimized for @xmath56 so that @xmath342 for any contour @xmath343 . this can be interpreted as a trivial perimeter law with an infinite characteristic length . in the polarized phase ( @xmath90 ) ,",
    "one can write @xmath344 , which is an area law with a characteristic area @xmath345 . our variational state thus correctly mimics the expected behavior of @xmath346 in the deconfined phase as well as in the confined phase .",
    "we now consider a field @xmath347 pointing along the @xmath191 axis . in this case , the model is known to display a first - order quantum phase transition at the self - dual point @xmath348 @xcite .",
    "the variational state reads @xmath349 where @xmath350 , is the polarized state where all spins point in the @xmath191 direction . for the sake of completeness , we introduced two variational parameters @xmath21 and @xmath351 but , for symmetry reasons",
    ", we expect them to be equal .",
    "since all calculations follow closely that of the preceding section , we shall directly give the results without further justification .",

    "again , the expression of @xmath364 could have been obtained by using a duality transformation and treating the dual model in a mean - field way .",
    "the study of @xmath364 shows that @xmath250 is always a minimum , but is the absolute minimum only for @xmath365 . for @xmath366 , a second local minimum appears and it becomes the absolute minimum for @xmath251 . for @xmath252 , two absolute minima coexist , at @xmath250 and at @xmath367 .",
    "we thus find a first - order quantum phase transition at @xmath252 .",
    "consequently , our variational analysis is thus about @xmath368 off the exact result @xmath369 , and misses the self - duality of the model @xcite .",
