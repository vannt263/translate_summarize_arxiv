    "since the discovery of the colossal magneto - resistance ( cmr ) effect in ( la , pb)mno@xmath3 @xcite , manganites have been comprehensively investigated throughout the last years , e.g. chatterji @xcite .",
    "extensive studies focused especially on members of two groups : the perovskite - type compounds ( space groups @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) and the layered compounds of the so - called ruddlesden - popper series ( space group @xmath6 ) with the general formula a@xmath7mn@xmath8o@xmath9 , where a is a rare - earth metal and @xmath10 is the number of corner - shared mno@xmath11 octahedral sheets forming the layer  @xcite . + pb@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 can not be classified in either of these groups , although , like the @xmath12 compounds of the ruddlesden - popper series , it grows in a pronounced crystalline anisotropy with alternating monolayers of mno@xmath11 octahedra and pbo sheets .",
    "the first synthesis was reported in literature already thirty years ago  @xcite , but until recent times little was known about the physical properties .",
    "no evidence of cmr is present in the pure compound . nevertheless , the layered type structure and the presence of a mixed valence state of mn ions ( mn@xmath13/mn@xmath14 ) recently motivated a new thorough investigation : magnetisation and specific heat measurements on pb@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 revealed several magnetic phases including long - range magnetic ordering below @xmath15  k @xcite and paramagnetic charge localisation at @xmath16  k. dielectric properties give rise to formation of polarons , which make pb@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 a promising candidate for multiferroic materials @xcite .",
    "+ however , the basis for further microscopic investigations of the physical properties is the exact knowledge of the crystal symmetry .",
    "the structural properties of the layered compound pb@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 have been a matter of debate since the first report on its structure by darriet _",
    "@xcite , using single crystal x - ray diffraction data taken with a laboratory k@xmath17 molybdenum source .",

    "@xcite in the orthorhombic space group @xmath19 which involved shifting the origin by about 0.25 in @xmath20-direction . symmetrizing the positions of some pairs of atoms by shifts up to 0.2  was thereby necessary .",
    "shortly afterwards , le page & calvert  @xcite found that a description in @xmath21 discloses a new class of systematic absences not accounted for previously .",
    "the new hexagonal unit cell of pb@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 is related to the orthorhombic description in @xmath19 by @xmath22 .",
    "nevertheless , weissenberg and laue patterns also indicate contradictory results concerning hexagonal and orthorhombic symmetry @xcite . in order to settle this discrepancy between the different models and in order to investigate the structural properties as a function of temperature , we performed new measurements on this material employing high - resolution synchrotron radiation .",
    "single crystals were grown by the flux method , as described in @xcite .",
    "the flux agent pbo was chosen since it is known as an effective solvent for many oxide compounds and allows to avoid incorporation of foreign ions into the lattice .",
    "the synthesis of pb@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals started with heating a mixture of 93 % by weight of high purity pbo and 7  % by weight of mn@xmath23o@xmath3 in a platinum crucible at 1000  @xmath24c for 4  h. afterwards , the crucible was cooled to 900  @xmath24c at a cooling rate of @xmath25  @xmath24c / h , followed by non - constrained cooling to room temperature . single crystals with a plate - like hexagonal form and a shiny black surface were found on the solidified liquid surface .",
    "the plates measured up to 40  mm in diameter and were extracted mechanically from the flux .",
    "afterwards , the crystals were carefully ground for synchrotron powder diffraction investigations .",
    "+ thermogravimetric analysis was employed to verify the oxygen content in our sample .",
    "the powder sample was heated from room temperature up to 800  @xmath24c in a 5@xmath26 h@xmath23/ 95@xmath26 he flux at a heating rate of 2 @xmath24c/ minute .",

    "as discussed by volkov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite there are two factors which can cause polyhedral distortions of the mno@xmath11 octahedra in pb@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the first factor is the jahn - teller effect which originates from degenerate orbital states of the mn@xmath13 ions in a regular octahedral crystal field .",
    "the valence state of the mn ions is discussed explicitly below .",
    "secondly the stereo - active lone pairs of the 6s@xmath55 electrons in pb@xmath56 can lead to significant shifts of some oxygen positions due to repulsion of the lone pair with pb - o bonds .",
    "this assumption can be supported by the fact , that strongly distorted mno@xmath11 octahedra consist of oxygen ions which are in close proximity to pb ions .",
    "+ according to the stoichiometry of the formula unit , the mn ions in pb@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 are in a mixed valence state mn@xmath13/mn@xmath14 with a ratio 4/3 . assuming the jahn - teller effect to be responsible for the distortion",
    ", one can distribute mn@xmath13 ions onto interlayer mn sites ( mn4 , mn5 ) and mn@xmath14 ions onto the undistorted positions ( mn6 , mn7 ) in a straightforward way .",
    "assuming further that the remaining mn atoms have equal probability to be in either of the oxidation state , one obtains the total ratio of mn@xmath13/mn@xmath57 corresponding to the stoichiometry of the formula unit .",
    "the distribution of tri- and tetravalent mn ions can be estimated from mn - o bond lengths via bond - valence sums ( bvs ) .",
    "the bvs is proportional to the sum over the deviation @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the measured bond length and @xmath60 an emperical parameter for the mean cation - anion distance .",
    "since the @xmath60 values for mn@xmath13 and mn@xmath14 are very similar , one single @xmath60 value ( 1.76   ) can be used as an estimate for the calculations @xcite .",
    "the result ( table [ tbl : octahedras ] ) is less satisfactory than reported by volkov _",
    "@xcite , but we assume it more accurate since the lower symmetric space group we used allows an investigation of non - averaged bond - lengths . after this analysis",
    "it is less evident to connect unambiguously the strongly distorted octahedra ( mn4 , mn5 ) with the jahn - teller effect ( see table [ tbl : octahedras ] ) . at this point",
    "no final conclusion can be drawn about the mixed valence state in pb@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 since mn ions on all crystallographic sites seem to be in average in a state between tri- and tetravalency which can not be connected to the degree of octahedral distortion .",
    "we re - investigated the mixed valence mn@xmath13/mn@xmath14 manganite pb@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath61 using x - ray synchrotron powder diffraction .",
    "the oxygen content was verified by thermogravimetry .",
    "rietveld refinement showed that our data can be well described within the orthorhombic space group @xmath39 and that there is no structural phase transition in the observed temperature range 15 @xmath62 @xmath36 @xmath62 295 k. the refined space group is different to several previous descriptions reported in literature , which were all analysed from the data set taken by darriet _",
    "the crystal symmetry stays unchanged in the investigated temperature regime , the pseudo - hexagonal arrangement of the mn atoms gets stretched along the @xmath33 axis at low temperatures and the pb atoms experience a systematic displacement .",
    "earlier investigations @xcite based on a higher symmetry phase and magnetization data suggest three different types of mno@xmath11 octahedra distinguished by the degree of distortion and the valence state of the mn ions .",
    "our synchrotron measurements on the same crystals as in @xcite show that this classification is less significant in the lower symmetric description and that bvs calculations could not clarify unambiguously the mn valence states .",
