    "section 3 presents simulation results for a vector order parameter with @xmath27 and @xmath41 components in one and two dimensions and the one - dimensional @xmath42 model . for the @xmath3 systems , we also present data for the real - space correlation function to demonstrate the dynamic scaling behaviour .",
    "we then discuss the procedure used to obtain the asymptotic functional form of the structure factor tail .",
    "next we compare the data to the results of the approximate analytic theory .",
    "finally we make some concluding comments on our results and a give a brief summary .",
    "the dynamic evolution of a non - conserved vector order parameter ( model a ) with @xmath11 components @xmath43 , for a zero - temperature quench , is described by a purely dissipative process defined in term of the following tdgl equation : @xmath44 with @xmath45 a kinetic coefficient that we will set equal to unity , and @xmath46 the free energy functional which generates the thermodynamic force , @xmath47 = \\int   d^d{\\bf x } \\left [ \\frac{1}{2 }   ( \\nabla \\vec{\\phi}({\\bf x},t))^2 + v(\\vec{\\phi}({\\bf x},t ) ) \\right]\\ ,     \\label{f}\\ ] ] with the potential defined as @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "the ground states , or fixed points of the dynamics , are determined by the condition @xmath50 , which defines a degenerate manifold of states connected by rotations . in the internal space of the order parameter , this manifold is the surface of an @xmath11-dimensional sphere . at late times",
    "the order parameter is saturated in length ( i.e.  lies on the ground state manifold everywhere ) .",
    "then the dynamics is driven by the decrease of the free - energy associated with the term @xmath51 in ( [ f ] ) , through a reduction in the magnitude of the spatial gradients .",
    "we can construct an explicit numerical scheme for the simulation based on a computationally efficient algorithm , namely the cell - dynamic system ( cds ) @xcite , which updates the order parameter according to the rule @xmath52\\ , \\ ] ] with @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number of nearest neighbors , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are parameters that we choose to be @xmath57 and @xmath58 in our simulations .",
    "the above numerical procedure is identical to that used by toyoki @xcite , differing only in the values of the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the cds is an euler - like algorithm and for convenience in our analysis of the results we use a unit of time equal to the update time step @xmath55 .",
    "it should be noted ( see figures 1 and 3 ) that the scaling regime is reached very quickly in these systems without defects , and very long runs are not necessary .",
    "the two - dimensional systems consist of a square lattice of size @xmath59 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the physical quantities are calculated as averages over 20 independent distributions of initial conditions .",
    "the one - dimensional systems have @xmath60 sites ( with periodic boundary conditions ) and we average @xmath61 independent runs .",
    "the initial conditions for the order parameter components @xmath62 were randomly chosen from a uniform distribution with support on the interval ( -0.1,0.1 ) .",
    "a quantity of interest that is computed during the course of the numerical simulation in the two - dimensional models is the two - point real - space correlation function @xmath63 where @xmath64 stands for the average over the set of independent initial conditions ( or ` runs ' ) . a spherical average over all possible distances @xmath65 is performed to find the isotropic real - space correlation @xmath66",
    ". the other function of interest , calculated for all the models , is the structure factor , @xmath67 we also make a spherical average over all possible values of @xmath68 with given @xmath69 .    in the calculation of these quantities at each time , the data are ` hardened ' by replacing the order parameter at each point by a unit vector in the same direction ( the fixed point of the cds iteration being a vector of unit length ) .",
    "this procedure accelerates the entry into the dynamic scaling regime , and helps us to elucidate the proper nature of the asymptotic tail in the structure factor .",
    "dynamic scaling is observed for all the models studied .",
    "the scaling regime is reached at quite early times , in agreement with previous studies .",
    "we show that dynamic scaling holds in the two - dimensional systems ( @xmath4 ) , using the characteristic length @xmath7 deduced from theoretical considerations @xcite .",
    "this agrees with earlier simulations of bray and humayun using ` hard - spin ' dynamics @xcite .",
    "figure 1(a ) presents a plot for @xmath3 , @xmath27 of the correlation function ( [ scaling : real ] ) as a function of distance @xmath70 for several times , while in figure 1(b ) we show the collapsed dynamic scaling function when the analysis is made using the scaling variable @xmath71 . as can be seen from the figure ,",
    "the scaling function @xmath72 is a monotonically decreasing function with the generic featureless shape that is characteristic of non - conserved @xmath0 models .",
    "it is of some interest to investigate the small-@xmath73 behavior of the real - space scaling function @xmath72 . in systems with @xmath17 , the existence of singular topological defects leads to a non - analytic term of the form @xmath74 ( with an additional @xmath75 factor for even @xmath11 ) , which leads to the @xmath76 porod tail in fourier space @xcite . in the present case , where @xmath77 , we expect no such short - distance singularities . therefore , we consider an expansion of the form @xmath78 . in table 1",
    "we present the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 determined from the simulations in the range @xmath81 .",
    "the ratio @xmath82 should be a universal number for given @xmath11 and @xmath2 .",
    "it will be seen from table 1 that this ratio has the value @xmath83 for @xmath27 , different from the value @xmath84 obtained for a gaussian function , which is the exact result for the limit @xmath39 . for @xmath41 ,",
    "table 1 gives @xmath85 , already consistent with the large-@xmath11 result .",
    "however , in the absence of any short - distance singularity , the small-@xmath73 behavior provides no useful information on the nature of the tail in the structure factor .",
    "consequently , it is more convenient to investigate directly the simulation results of the structure factor and extract from them the asymptotic behaviour .",
    "we shall see that the behavior in fourier space is clearly non - gaussian , even for @xmath41 .",
    "as expected , given the absence of topological defects , the results indicate ( fig .",
    "2 ) that the decay of the structure factor is clearly faster than a power law , in contrast to the interpretation of his own similar results by toyoki @xcite . in order to demonstrate that the tail is well described by the stretched exponential form @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the scaling variable in momentum space , we attempt to find the corresponding power @xmath10 in the exponential by plotting @xmath88 versus @xmath89 and adjusting the value of @xmath10 until the best linear behavior is obtained in the regime @xmath90 . during the fitting procedure",
    "the other two parameters of the fit , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , are readily determined .",
    "the criteria used for the optimum fitting is based on the pearson correlation coefficient ( pcc ) , which measure the strength of the linear relation among two variables and varies between -1 ( perfect negative linear relation ) and @xmath93 ( perfect positive linear relationship ) .",
    "we proceed as follows : first , we choose an exponent @xmath10 and then perform linear regression ; next we change @xmath10 until the pcc reaches its maximum value .",
    "the regression coefficients are calculated using the values of the scaling structure function at the last two times in the simulation .",
    "the optimum values for system with @xmath27 components are @xmath94 with a pearson coefficient of @xmath95 .",
    "the other two parameters are @xmath96 and @xmath97 this result is presented in the fig .",
    "we turn now to the description of the case @xmath41 , following a similar analysis to the @xmath27 model .",
    "3(a ) shows the correlation function as a function of distance for different times . in this model",
    "the collapse is also achieved using the characteristic length @xmath40 , as can be observed in fig.3(b ) .",
    "therefore , both models are consistent with dynamical exponent @xmath98 . the corresponding scaling plot for the structure factor is shown in fig .",
    "a more important effect is observed in the structure factor tail , because in this case it has also a stretched exponential but with an apparently larger exponent . following an analysis similar to that used for @xmath27 , we find that the value of the best fit value of the exponent is @xmath99 , and the corresponding pcc in the regression is @xmath100 .",
    "the other two parameters are @xmath101 and @xmath102 . in fig .",
    "4(b ) we plot @xmath88 against @xmath89 and the linear behaviour is clearly seen .",
    "comparison between the real - space correlation functions of the @xmath27 and @xmath41 models shows that the scaling functions are very similar ; the main difference is that the scaling function decreases slightly more slowly for @xmath41 than @xmath27 .",
    "this is reflected in the parameters of the fitting function for the small-@xmath73 range : the amplitudes @xmath79 and @xmath80 tend to decrease as @xmath11 increases ( table 1 ) .",
    "we turn to the discussion of the simulation results for one - dimensional systems .",
    "we shall describe the relevant behavior in fourier space .",
    "real - space data has been presented in @xcite .",
    "our results show that in one - dimensional systems the asymptotic behavior of the structure factor also has a stretched exponential form , but the fitted exponents @xmath10 are larger than those of the corresponding two - dimensional models , and close to unity for @xmath27 and 5 .    in fig .",
    "5(a ) , we present the simulation results for the scaling function @xmath8 of the structure factor for the one - dimensional heisenberg model ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the continuous curve is the result of the analytical approach described in section iv .",
    "the analysis of the asymptotic behaviour gives an exponent @xmath103 for the stretched exponential .",
    "5(b ) shows the curve of @xmath104 $ ] versus @xmath89 , where the linear behaviour is clearly observed .",
    "similarly , we present the corresponding plots for the @xmath27 model in fig .  6 , where the measured exponent is now @xmath105 , while for @xmath41 we obtain @xmath106 as is shown in fig .",
    "the values of @xmath10 for the last two models are so close that in practice it is difficult to distinguish between them .",
    "they are also close to the value unity obtained from the approximate large-@xmath11 equation discussed in the following section .",
    "it is clear from the results for the one - dimensional models that the scaling function in real space is not a gaussian function , despite the good real - space fits to this form obtained in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the ( effective ) exponents @xmath10 for the @xmath4 models are bigger than for the corresponding models in two dimensions .",
    "therefore , we have evidence that the exponent @xmath10 increases with @xmath11 , while it seems to decrease with @xmath2 .",
    "note that the gaussian result obtained for @xmath107 corresponds to @xmath108 , so the results presented here for the structure - factor tail are actually quite far from that limit . the analytical treatment presented in the next section",
    "gives some indication of why this might be expected .",
    "in particular , it suggests that the structure factor is dominated by a simple exponential for @xmath109 at fixed large @xmath11 , while the familiar gaussian form is recovered as @xmath39 at fixed @xmath18 .",
    "we conclude this section by discussing briefly some alternative fitting forms for the structure factor tail .",
    "first , however , we note that the stretched exponential form ( [ se ] ) describes the tail well over at least 10 decades of @xmath110 in all cases . of course , this represents a much smaller dynamic range ( 1 to @xmath111 decades ) in the scaling variable @xmath87 .",
    "motivated by the analytical result [ equation ( [ g ] ) below ] of the approximate large-@xmath11 theory , other fitting forms were tried for @xmath3 ( the agreement with the large-@xmath11 theory already being good for @xmath112 and 5 in @xmath5 )",
    ". a direct fit of ( [ g ] ) does not work well for @xmath3 .",
    "allowing for a general power - law prefactor , @xmath113 , gives a reasonable fit , but with very large values for @xmath73  5.6 for @xmath27 , and 6.7 for @xmath41 .",
    "fixing @xmath114 , but allowing for a general stretched exponent @xmath10 again gives a reasonable fit ( with @xmath115 for @xmath27 and 0.70 for @xmath41 ) , but over a significantly reduced range of @xmath18 .",
    "for these reasons we prefer the unmodified stretched exponential ( [ se ] ) as giving the simplest and most convincing description of the large-@xmath18 data , at least for these small values of @xmath11 in @xmath3 .",
    "of course , it is quite possible that the form ( [ g ] ) will fit the data well at larger values of @xmath11 .",
    "in an attempt to gain some analytical insight into the structure factor asymptotics , we start from an approximate equation of motion for the pair correlation function derived using the gaussian auxiliary field approach pioneered by mazenko @xcite .",
    "we then make , for reasons that will become clear , the further simplification of retaining only the leading nonlinearity as @xmath39 .",
    "the resulting equation is then finally used to extract the asymptotics of @xmath8 .",
    "the gaf method for vector fields has been discussed in some detail elsewhere .",
    "we refer the reader to the original papers @xcite and a recent review @xcite for a full exposition .",
    "the essence of the method is a mapping from the original field variable @xmath116 to an ` auxiliary field ' @xmath117 .",
    "the function @xmath118 satisfies the equation @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the potential in the ginzburg - landau function ( 4 ) . with the boundary conditions @xmath121 , and @xmath122 for @xmath123 , this equation for @xmath118 represents the equilibrium profile function for a spherically symmetric topological defect , with @xmath124 representing distance from the defect .",
    "the ( uncontrolled ) approximation that @xmath117 is a gaussian field , and the imposition of the scaling form ( 1 ) , leads eventually to the self - consistent equation @xcite @xmath125 for the scaling function @xmath72 , where primes indicate derivatives . in ( [ sc1 ] )",

    "the constant @xmath134 in ( [ sc1 ] ) has to be adjusted so that @xmath72 vanishes sufficiently fast at infinity @xcite .",
    "as should be clear from the above discussion , ( [ sc1 ] ) only really makes sense for @xmath17 , based as it is on the presence of singular topological objects whose positions are defined by the zeros of the field @xmath116 or , equivalently , by the zeros of @xmath117 .",
    "indeed , the function @xmath130 has inbuilt structure that generates the porod tail associated with such defects .",
    "specifically , in the short - distance limit , where @xmath135 , the hypergeometric function in ( [ bpt ] ) has a singular contribution of order @xmath136 ( with a logarithmic correction for even @xmath11 ) .",
    "since @xmath137 for small scaling variable @xmath73 , this singular term is of order @xmath138 ( again , with a logarithm for even @xmath11 ) , leading to the power - law tail @xmath19 in fourier space . within the gaf approach , this tail is obtained for _ all _ @xmath11 and @xmath2 . for @xmath24 , however , neither singular topological objects nor nonsingular topological textures exist , so the gaf result is qualitatively incorrect . indeed",
    ", this is to be expected since the gaf approach is specifically designed to build in the defect structure .",
    "so what should one do when there are no defects ?",
    "we have seen that the usual gaf approach always give a porod tail , for any @xmath11 and @xmath2 : this is unphysical for @xmath24 , since the tail is a consequence of the presence of topological defects .",
    "one way around this impasse is to artificially approximate the full gaf equation ( [ sc1 ] ) by the form valid for @xmath39 . in this limit @xmath139 , and ( [ sc1 ] )",
    "becomes , correct to @xmath140 , @xmath141 this step , admittedly ad - hoc , has the desired effect of eliminating the unwanted ( for @xmath24 ) short - distance singularity in @xmath72 .",

    "the value of @xmath92 is not determined by this argument ; instead one can derive ( see appendix ) the relationship @xmath153 between @xmath92 and the prefactor @xmath91 in the asymptotic form ( [ g ] ) .",
    "the existence of these simple poles in real space also follows directly from the real - space equation ( [ sc2 ] ) . if one assumes a singularity of the form @xmath154 , with @xmath155 , then balancing the dominant terms @xmath156 and @xmath157 gives immediately @xmath158 , i.e.  a simple pole .",

    "then our previous arguments apply , and the asymptotic form ( [ g ] ) , with @xmath91 and @xmath92 related by ( [ a ] ) , are recovered .",
    "this approach therefore predicts that the structure factors for conserved and nonconserved systems will have the _ same _ asymptotic forms , at least within the context of the bh truncation .",
    "the same conclusion was drawn from recent numerical solutions of the bh equation @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have studied the dynamics of phase ordering for models without topological defects in one and two dimensions .",
    "we find that scaling is achieved with the growth law @xmath40 .",
    "the tail in the structure factor is well fitted by a stretched exponential form .",
    "for the two - dimensional systems , table 1 summarizes the relevant parameters describing the fits in real and fourier space .",
    "in contrast to systems with singular defects ( @xmath32 ) , where the generalized porod form @xmath19 for the structure factor tail is a consequence of the defect structure , and is independent of the presence or absence of conservation laws , in systems without defects the functional form does , apparently , differ for conserved and nonconserved systems .",
    "we have shown , for example , that for the particular case of the @xmath27 model in two dimensions the tail is well described , over the range of @xmath18 accessible to us , by a stretched exponential with exponent @xmath193 , differing from the result for the same model with conservation studied by rc @xcite , who found @xmath194 .    within the ` toy ' equation of bray and humayun @xcite , however , we have shown that the true asymptotics are the _ same _ for conserved and nonconserved dynamics .",
    "of course , the bh equation is at best a large-@xmath11 theory , and the numerical results for nonconserved and conserved dynamics may converge as @xmath11 is increased .",
    "a related question is whether the exponents @xmath10 measured here and in @xcite are genuine asymptotic exponents , or effective exponents whose values will change as the range of @xmath18 over which the fit is made is moved to larger @xmath18 .",
    "more extensive simulations may cast some light on this issue .",
    "the ` universal ' ( independent of conservation laws ) porod tail behavior obtained for @xmath17 is geometrical in origin , being a consequence of the field structure induced by singular topological defects @xcite .",
    "as yet , however , we have no corresponding physical picture in the absence of topological defects .",
    "it is interesting that , within the simple model of equation ( [ sc1 ] ) , the exponent @xmath10 jumps discontinuously from @xmath108 at @xmath107 to @xmath148 for @xmath11 large but finite .",
    "more precisely , one can say that @xmath108 corresponds to the limit @xmath39 at fixed , large @xmath18 , while @xmath195 corresponds to @xmath109 at fixed , large @xmath11 .",
    "we have argued that the crossover between these limiting forms for fixed , large @xmath11 occurs at @xmath183 .",
    "this change of behavior depending on the order of the limits is reminiscent of the result obtained from the conserved version of ( [ sc1 ] ) , where a novel ` multiscaling ' behavior is obtained for @xmath39 at fixed , large @xmath196 @xcite , while simple scaling is recovered for @xmath197 at fixed , large @xmath11 @xcite . for the nonconserved case , one always has simple scaling . for both conserved and nonconserved fields , however , the asymptotics of @xmath8 are sensitive to whether @xmath11 is large or truly infinite .",
    "this rules out , for example , exploring the asymptotics by expanding around the large-@xmath11 solution in powers of @xmath33 .",
