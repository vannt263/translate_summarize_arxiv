    "the growth of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) is related to the growth of their host - spheroid , as evinced by the existence of various @xmath15 scaling relations .",

    "2005 ; mandelbaum et al .",
    "2005 ; lauer et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "however , little attention has been given to the issue of ( in)consistency with pre - existing galaxy scaling relations .",
    "this paper highlights that at the heart of a crucial inconsistency is the ( typically overlooked ) bent nature of the luminosity - velocity dispersion relation ( e.g.  davies et al.1983 ; matkovi & guzmn 2005 ) . by addressing this inconsistency",
    " previously noted in passing by ( bernardi et al .  2007 ; graham . ] 2007b , his appendix  a ; graham & driver 2007 , their section 3.2 ; graham 2008b , his section  2.2.2 )  it is revealed that the @xmath13-@xmath1 and @xmath13-@xmath16 relations are better described by a _ broken _ power - law having two distinct slopes . given the log - linear @xmath16@xmath10 relation ( e.g.  graham & guzmn 2003 , and references therein )",
    ", this result is in accord with the non-(log - linear ) @xmath0-@xmath10 relation ( graham & driver 2007 ) .",
    "it also resolves the increasingly noticed , but until now unexplained , problem that the previous log - linear @xmath13-@xmath1 and @xmath13-@xmath16 relations over - predict smbh masses by an order of magnitude relative to the @xmath13-@xmath12 relation at low smbh masses ( e.g.  gltekin et al .",
    "2011 ; coziol et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "after kormendy ( 2001 ) reported that classical bulges and pseudobulges follow the same black hole scaling relations , graham ( 2007a , 2008a , b ) and hu ( 2008 ) revealed that barred / pseudobulge galaxies _ can _ be offset from what is a log - linear @xmath13@xmath12 relation defined by the non - barred and ` classic ' spheroids .",
    "given this observation , coupled with the _ broken _",
    "@xmath16@xmath12 relation for classical bulges and elliptical galaxies ( see the review in graham 2012a ) , the @xmath13@xmath16 and @xmath13@xmath1 relations can not be log - linear for such spheroids .    at the high - mass end where galaxies with partially - depleted cores  thought to have formed from a small number of ` dry ' galaxy merger events ( e.g.  begelman , blandford & rees 1980 ; faber et al.1997 ; graham 2004 ; bell et al .",
    "2004 )  simple addition of ( cold gas)-free early - type galaxies requires that the final smbh mass increases in lock step with the host spheroid mass and stellar luminosity ( see also peng 2007 and jahnke & macci 2011 ) . to date , the @xmath13@xmath16 relations have been dominated by luminous galaxies with smbh masses typically greater than @xmath17 . from these samples",
    "it has been found that @xmath18 ( e.g.  graham 2007b ) .",
    "similarly , the @xmath13@xmath1 relation has also been reported to have an exponent close to 1 when using bright massive spheroids ( marconi & hunt 2003 ; hring & rix 2004 ) , further supporting the dry merger scenario .",
    "it has long been known that the luminous ( `` core '' ) galaxies follow the luminosity-(velocity dispersion ) relation @xmath19 ( e.g.schechter 1980 ; malumuth & kirshner 1981 ) and more recently the relation @xmath7 ( e.g.  merritt & ferrarese 2001a ; hu 2008 ; graham et al .",
    "2011 ) , and thus one has that @xmath20 at the high - mass end .",
    "the hitherto ignored inconsistency arises from the observation that the fainter ( @xmath21 mag ) elliptical galaxies ( not pseudobulges ) do not obey the relation @xmath19 but rather @xmath22 ( davies et al .  1983 ; held et al .",
    "1992 ; de rijcke et al .",

    "2009 ) .",
    "in essence , given that ( non - barred ) srsic galaxies follow the relation @xmath7 and @xmath22 , then they must follow the relation @xmath28 .",
    "this is much steeper than the @xmath20 relation which is currently in use at both high and low - masses and brings into question the validity of the extrapolation of the current relation defined by predominantly bright galaxies .",
    "it similarly brings into question the applicability of the log - linear relation between the smbh mass and the stellar mass of the host spheroid and the dynamical mass within the effective radius .",

    "the implications and consequences of these bent black hole scaling relations are many , and some of these are briefly discussed in section  [ sec_disc ] . in the following section we introduce the data set that is used in section  [ sec_anal ] to determine the slopes in the @xmath13@xmath1 diagram for both `` core '' galaxies and `` srsic '' galaxies , thought to have formed form dissipationless and dissipational processes , respectively , and thus check for consistency among the established galaxy scaling relations .",
    "the useful hring & rix ( 2004 ) @xmath13 and @xmath1 data set of 30 galaxies has been used in this study , with the following updates .",
    "when available , the latest smbh masses have been used ( see the compilations in graham 2008b and graham et al .",
    "the distances from tonry et al.(2001 ) , and thus the smbh masses , have been reduced by 2.8% following the 0.06 mag correction to the distance moduli , as explained in blakeslee et al.(2002 , their section  4.6 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion for the milky way was increased from 75 to 100 km s@xmath25 ( merritt & ferrarese 2001a ) while the velocity dispersion for m32 was reduced from 75 to 55 km s@xmath25 to reflect that of the host bulge ( e.g.  lucey et al .",
    "1997 ; i.chilingarian 2012 , in prep . )",
    "however , with this latter update the so - called ` compact elliptical ' m32 ( graham 2002 ) appears to be a rather dramatic outlier from the @xmath0@xmath1 relation defined by the other ordinary ( non - dwarf ) srsic spheroids and it is therefore excluded from the following linear regression .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the original and the new location of each galaxy in the @xmath13@xmath12 and @xmath13@xmath1 diagrams .",
    "the breakdown of the remaining 29 galaxy types is that 12 are `` core '' galaxies , 12 are non - barred srsic galaxies and 5 are barred srsic galaxies ( dullo & graham 2012 , in preparation ) . the srsic galaxy which resides , in figure  [ fig1 ] , within the region of the parameter space where the core galaxies are found is ngc  3115 ( byun et al .  1996 , their figure  3 ) . the non - barred galaxy which resides within the region of the parameter space where the barred galaxies are found is ngc  821 .",
    "to avoid a solution which is dependent on the ( somewhat disputed ) measurement errors , the regression analysis slopes from feigelson & babu ( 1992 ) has been used . for the `` core '' galaxies , a symmetrical ordinary least squares ( ols ) bisector regression was used . due to the smbh sample selection bias",
    " discussed immediately below  which excludes data at the low - mass end , an ols regression of the abscissa @xmath31 on the ordinate @xmath32 was used for the srsic galaxies .",

    "the total rms scatter in the @xmath49 direction is given by @xmath35 .",
    "at the low mass end of the @xmath0@xmath12 and @xmath13@xmath1 diagram , smbhs of a given mass will not be detectable if the host spheroid s velocity dispersion @xmath12 is too high .",
    "this is because the smbh s gravitational sphere - of - influence @xmath50 will be too small to resolve ( merritt & ferrarese 2001b ) .",
    "this sample selection bias  which results in an apparent absence of data points beneath the relations in figure  [ fig1 ] at the low-@xmath13 end  acts to reduce the fitted slope of the relations for the srsic galaxies ( batcheldor 2010 ; graham et al .",
    "2011 ; schulze & wisotzki 2011 ) .",
    "as noted by graham et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , while performing an ols(@xmath51 ) regression helps to circumvent the problem of the artificial floor in the @xmath13@xmath12 data set ( see lynden - bell et al .  1988 and",
    "feigelson & babu 1992 for an understanding of this problem ) , the upwardly - sloping false - floor in the @xmath13@xmath12 and @xmath13@xmath1 data means that the slopes in table  [ tab1 ] for the srsic galaxies will underestimate the true slope . for galaxies at the same distance , such as those in a cluster",

    "there are at least three things to note when considering figure  [ fig1 ] and table  [ tab1 ] : ( i ) barred galaxies are known to be offset from the @xmath13@xmath12 relation ( graham 2007a,2008a ) , with their inclusion increasing the ` classical ' ( i.e.  all galaxy type ) slope from @xmath535 to @xmath536 ( graham et al .",
    "2011 ) ; ( ii ) the `` core '' galaxies in figure  [ fig1 ] appear to have the same slope in the @xmath13@xmath12 diagram as the non - barred srsic galaxies , and ( iii ) the non - barred srsic galaxies in figure  [ fig1 ] have a slope which is twice as steep as that of `` core '' galaxies in the @xmath13@xmath1 diagram  the significance of which can be seen in table  [ tab1 ] .    for reference ,",
    "the _ total _ rms scatter in the @xmath54 direction , denoted by @xmath35 , from the hring & rix ( 2004 ) @xmath13@xmath14 data about a single log - linear relation is @xmath530.5 dex , with the value of @xmath530.3 dex quoted in their abstract pertaining to the intrinsic scatter . while the lower half of our table  [ tab1 ] reports a total rms scatter of 0.44 dex for the core galaxies , the value of 0.57 dex for the non - barred srsic galaxies is higher  possibly due to greater difficulties in acquiring accurate @xmath55 values for spheroids in disc galaxies .",
    "this possibility offers valid grounds for comparing the _ intrinsic _ scatter , i.e.  the scatter after accounting for measurement errors , but it requires confidence in the measurement errors .",
    "it should also be kept in mind that our relation for the srsic galaxies was constructed by minimising the residuals in the horizontal direction rather than the @xmath54 direction . while this level of scatter is greater than that observed for the _ barless _ @xmath13@xmath12 relations , the sample size is small and it would be premature to conclude which relation is more fundamental .    the log - linear relation from hring & rix ( 2004 ) , can substantially over - predict the smbh masses for srsic galaxies .",
    "relative to the second last entry in table  [ tab1 ] , it does so by a factor of @xmath535 at @xmath56 , and by an order of magnitude at @xmath57 .",
    "for the `` core '' galaxies the @xmath58 ratio is roughly constant at 0.36% , which is double the old median value of 0.140.2% ( e.g.  ho 1999 ; kormendy 2001 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ; hring & rix 2004 ) . at @xmath59 ,",

    "more precisely , we have that @xmath65 and it is noted that the coefficient 0.92 may be slightly underestimated due to the sample selection bias .",
    "magorrian et al .  ( 1998 ) wrote that there was marginal evidence for core galaxies having a steeper dependence on @xmath1 than power - law galaxies .",
    "this is the opposite behavior to what is observed here using updated smbh masses .",
    "the single ( non - linear ) log - linear relation @xmath66 from laor s ( 2001 ) pioneering work , ( see also salucci et al.2000 , their figure  8 , which admittedly contains potentially offset barred spiral galaxies ) , can now be better understood in terms of a linear relation for the core galaxies combined with a power - law relation for the srsic galaxies .",
    "the bent distribution seen in figure  [ fig1 ] can additionally be seen in the @xmath13@xmath1 diagram of sani et al .",
    "( 2011 , their figure  3 ) and decarli et al .",
    "( 2011 , their figure  4 )  although it should perhaps be noted that these authors have not actually advocated a bent relation themselves .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] reveals a transition around @xmath67 = 12@xmath68 , and smbhs with masses less than this can also be seen to systematically reside below the single log - linear @xmath13@xmath16 relation defined by the predominantly bright ( `` core '' ) galaxies in graham ( 2007b , his figure  3 ) , in gltekin et al .",
    "( 2009 , their figure  4 ) , and in sani et al .",
    "( 2011 , their figure  2 ) .",

    "2011 , their figure  3 ) and when plotted against the number of globular clusters surrounding a galaxy ( harris & harris 2011 ) , revealing that both of these distributions , in addition to the @xmath13@xmath1 and @xmath13@xmath16 distribution , should also be described by a broken or curved relation rather than a single power - law .",
    "recent papers have tended to assume that if a galaxy has a smbh mass that resides beneath the single log - linear @xmath13@xmath1 relation defined by , for example , hring & rix ( 2004 ) , or beneath the single log - linear @xmath13@xmath16 relation , then this is evidence of a pseudobulge ( e.g.  kormendy et al .",
    "2011 ; mathur et al .  2011 ; sani et al .",
    "however this is wrong because classical spheroids , in particular those with the lower masses and thus lower srsic indices ( @xmath692 ) , reside below these old relations due to the previously over - looked non-(log - linear ) behavior of the @xmath13@xmath1 , and @xmath13@xmath16 , distribution for classical spheroids .",
    "these exact same spheroids are not outliers from the @xmath13@xmath12 relation , and they define the @xmath22 relation , that is , they are not pseudobulges ( see graham 2011 and 2012a for a fuller discussion and explanation ) .    separate from the above fact , it is noted that there is some suggestion in figure  [ fig1 ] that barred galaxies may be offset , to either higher dynamical masses ( @xmath63 ) or lower smbh masses , from the new non-(log - linear ) @xmath13@xmath1 relation defined by the core and non - barred srsic galaxies .",
    "these offset barred galaxies may be pseudobulges , although as graham ( 2012a ) details , this is difficult to establish .",
    "theories of supermassive black hole formation may require modification if they have tied themselves to past observations of the @xmath13@xmath1 or @xmath13@xmath16 relation defined by massive spheroids .",
    "this remark extends to semi - analytical modelling , e.g.  croton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , in which the black hole mass growth is dominated by prescriptions set to reproduce the @xmath13@xmath1 relation from marconi & hunt ( 2004 ) and hring & rix ( 2004 ) . if built by major ( i.e.  near equal mass ) dry merger events , then the one - to - one @xmath13@xmath1 scaling relation found here is easy to understand without any great theoretical insight .",
    "some focus should additionally be spent on spheroids built through dissipational processes involving star formation and smbh growth , for which a linear @xmath0@xmath1 relation is evidently not applicable .",
    "past analysis of the smbh mass function and smbh mass density ( e.g.  shankar et al .",
    "2004 ; vika et al .",
    "2009 ) which were based on a single log - linear @xmath13@xmath16 relation defined primarily by ` core ' galaxies will also need to be revised .",
    "furthermore , past ( @xmath13@xmath16)-based predictions for the future detection and measurement of smbh masses in more distant galaxies , observed with next - generation facilities , will also need to be revised .",
    "while the lower than expected smbh masses in low - mass spheroids will effectively reduce the number of detections , it may fortuitously increase the prospects for the discovery of intermediate mass black holes ( @xmath70 ) . due to their smaller black hole masses",
    ", the potential impact of smbh feedback in these and slightly larger spheroids is much lower than previously thought , and one may query whether it can in fact regulate the growth of the surrounding spheroid  although there is still some evidence of this in the milky way ( su et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "if the @xmath16@xmath12 relation turns out to be only approximated by a broken power - law that matches some curved relation  perhaps a log - quadratic relation like that used for the @xmath13@xmath10 relation ( graham & driver 2007 )  then a curved @xmath13@xmath1 and @xmath13@xmath16 relation would be preferable . alternatively , perhaps the @xmath13@xmath10 relation is better described by a broken power - law .",

    "the curved or broken nature of the @xmath13@xmath16 and @xmath13@xmath14 , and @xmath13@xmath10 ( graham & driver 2007 ) , relations means that attempts to compare the scatter about a single log - linear relation in each diagram is an inappropriate exercise .",

    "moreover , bulge+bar+disc fits are required for the barred galaxy sample , and dust corrections are required for accurate bulge luminosities in disc galaxies .    due to core galaxies and srsic galaxies following different relations in the @xmath13(@xmath81 diagram , one may need to be careful when trying to construct and interpret a relation to describe the location of all galaxies on a single ( @xmath82 ) plane ( e.g.  marconi & hunt 2003 ; feoli & mele 2005 , 2007 ; de francesco et al .",

    "<S> the popular log - linear relation between supermassive black hole mass , @xmath0 , and the dynamical mass of the host spheroid , @xmath1 , is shown to require a significant correction . </S>",
    "<S> core galaxies , typically with @xmath2 and thought to be formed in dry merger events , are shown to be well described by a linear relation for which the median black hole mass is 0.36%  roughly double the old value of constancy . of greater significance </S>",
    "<S> is that @xmath3 among the ( non - pseudobulge ) lower - mass systems : specifically , @xmath4 = ( 1.92\\pm0.38)\\log[m_{\\rm sph}/7\\times10^{10}m_{\\odot } ] + ( 8.38\\pm0.17)$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> ` classical ' spheroids hosting a @xmath5 black hole will have @xmath6% . </S>",
    "<S> these new relations presented herein ( i ) bring consistency to the relation @xmath7 and the fact that @xmath8 with exponents of 5 and 2 for bright ( @xmath9 mag ) and faint spheroids , respectively , ( ii ) mimic the non-(log - linear ) behavior known to exist in the @xmath0(srsic @xmath10 ) diagram , ( iii ) necessitate the existence of a previously over - looked @xmath11 relation for srsic ( i.e.  not core - srsic ) galaxies , and ( iv ) resolve past conflicts ( in mass prediction ) with the @xmath0@xmath12 relation at the low - mass end . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the bent nature of the @xmath13@xmath14 relation reported here for ` classical ' spheroids will have a host of important implications that , while not addressed in this paper , relate to ( i ) galaxy / black hole formation theories , ( ii ) searches for the fundamental , rather than secondary , black hole scaling relation , ( iii ) black hole mass predictions in other galaxies , ( iv ) alleged pseudobulge detections , ( v ) estimates of the black hole mass function and mass density based on luminosity functions , ( vi ) predictions for space - based gravitational wave detections , ( vii ) connections with nuclear star cluster scaling relations , ( viii ) evolutionary studies over different cosmic epochs , ( ix ) comparisons and calibrations matching inactive black hole masses with low - mass agn data , and more . </S>"
