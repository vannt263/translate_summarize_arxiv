    "the anderson metal - insulator transition is a genuine quantum phase transition , which has been widely investigated in condensed matter physics since the seminal paper of anderson  @xcite . in the past years",
    "anderson transitions were found in a wide range of physical systems , such as ultrasound in disordered elastic networks  @xcite , light in disordered photonic lattices in the transverse direction  @xcite , or in an ultracold atomic system in a disordered laser trap  @xcite .",
    "a characteristic feature of anderson transitions is the rich multifractal structure of critical eigenstates , which has been the subject of intense research activity in recent years ( see ref .   for a review ) .",
    "direct signs of multifractals at the metal - insulator transition point have been observed experimentally in dilute magnetic semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "multifractality can moreover influence the behavior of various systems near criticality in different ways .",
    "for example , the large overlap of multifractal wave - functions can increase the superconducting critical temperature  @xcite .",
    "the multifractality of the local density of states may induce a new phase because of the presence of local kondo effects induced by local pseudogaps at the fermi energy  @xcite .",
    "the simplest model displaying a metal - insulator transition is the anderson model , which describes non - interacting fermions in a disordered crystal .",
    "disorder is usually introduced through a random on - site potential , while hopping elements are fixed ( up to a random phase or @xmath0 rotation ) . in this case",
    "the system belongs to one of the wigner - dyson ( wd ) symmetry classes depending on the global symmetries of the system . on the other hand , systems with vanishing on - site terms and random hopping terms , if the lattice is bipartite , possess an additional chiral symmetry and belong to one of the chiral wd classes  @xcite .",
    "quite surprisingly , an anderson transition has been shown to take place also in the spectrum of the dirac operator in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at high temperature  @xcite ( see ref .",
    "for a review ) .",
    "qcd is the quantum field theory governing strong interactions at the microscopic level , and operates on length and energy scales vastly different from the ones usually encountered in condensed matter physics .",
    "qcd is a non abelian gauge theory , describing the interactions of quarks , which are fermions , and gluons , which are the vector bosons of the @xmath1 gauge symmetry .",
    "although these are the fundamental degrees of freedom , they do not appear in the spectrum of the theory at low temperatures , which contains only hadrons , i.e. , bound states of quarks and gluons , due to the phenomenon of confinement .",
    "however , at a ( pseudo)critical temperature , @xmath2 , strongly interacting matter undergoes a crossover to the so - called quark - gluon - plasma phase , and at high temperatures quarks and gluons are deconfined .",
    "this transition is accompanied by the restoration of the approximate chiral symmetry that is spontaneously broken at low temperatures  @xcite .",
    "c c c    eigvec_l56_ins.png ( 5,95)(a )    &    eigvec_l56_crit.png ( 5,95)(b )    &    eigvec_l56_met.png ( 5,95)(c )     +   +    contributions of quarks to observables , as well as all quark correlation functions , are entirely encoded in the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the dirac operator in the background of a non abelian gauge field .",
    "physical quantities are then obtained after averaging over the gauge field configurations with the appropriate path - integral measure . in this respect ,",
    "the eigenmodes of the dirac operator can be formally treated as the eigenstates of a random `` hamiltonian '' , with disorder provided by the gauge field fluctuations . among the eigenmodes , a prominent role",
    "is played by the low - lying ones : for example , they give the most important contributions to the quark correlation functions , and determine the fate of chiral symmetry through the banks - casher relation  @xcite .",
    "the low end of the spectrum looks completely different in the hadronic and in the quark - gluon - plasma phase . at low temperatures ,",
    "the density of states is finite near the origin , and both low - lying and bulk eigenmodes are extended throughout the system . in contrast , at high temperatures , above @xmath2 , the density of states vanishes at the origin , and the low - lying eigenmodes are localized on the scale of the inverse temperature , while higher up in the spectrum , beyond a temperature - dependent critical `` energy '' , @xmath3 , the eigenmodes are again extended  @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the `` mobility edge '' was investigated in ref .  ,",
    "in which it was found that @xmath3 extrapolates to zero at a temperature compatible with @xmath2 .",
    "typical dirac eigenmodes in the localized , critical and delocalized regimes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qcd_eigvecs ] .",
    "the transition in the spectrum from localized to delocalized eigenmodes has been shown to be a second - order phase transition , with critical exponent compatible with the one found in the three - dimensional unitary anderson model  @xcite .",
    "it is rather surprising at first that the anderson transition in the high - temperature qcd dirac spectrum seems to belong to the same universality class as that of the three - dimensional unitary anderson model . from the point of view of statistical systems ,",
    "qcd at a finite temperature @xmath4 is in fact a four - dimensional euclidean model , with the `` temporal '' dimension compactified on a circle of length @xmath5 .",
    "however , it has been argued that high - temperature qcd is an effectively three - dimensional disordered system with on - site disorder , the strength of which is set by the temperature  @xcite . while this makes it more plausible that the two models actually belong to the same universality class , it does not make it less important to look for further evidence . in this respect , finding the same multifractal structure in the critical eigenstates would give strong support to the claim of ref .  , and",
    "so to the broader universality of the critical properties of anderson transitions .",
    "the study of this multifractal structure is precisely the aim of this work .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section [ sec : mfss ]",
    "we give a brief discussion of multifractality , and of the method of multifractal finite - size scaling ( mfss ) . in section [ sec : qcd_numerics ] we describe in some detail the dirac operator and the numerical simulations of qcd employed in this paper . in section",
    "[ sec : qcd_corre ] we study the correlations between eigenvectors of the dirac operator around the critical energy , both for comparison to the 3d unitary anderson model , and for their appropriate treatment in the statistical analysis . in section [ sec : qcd_mfss ] we discuss the results of mfss for the eigenvectors of the dirac operator .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : concl ] we state our conclusions .",
    "in this section we briefly review wave - function multifractality and the technique of multifractal finite - size scaling .",
    "the wave - function @xmath6 of a particle in @xmath7 is naturally associated to a local probability distribution , namely @xmath8 , giving the probability to find the particle in an infinitesimal neighborhood of @xmath9 . for smooth wave functions , the probability to find the particle in a small but finite neighborhood of @xmath9 of size @xmath10 scales as @xmath11 . for fractal wave functions ,",
    "this probability scales as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is called the fractal dimension . for strongly fluctuating wave - functions , however , this probability scales in general as @xmath14 , with an @xmath9-dependent power @xmath15 called the local dimension . in turn , points with the same local dimension , @xmath16 , constitute a subset of @xmath7 characterized by its own fractal dimension , which generally depends on @xmath17 .",
    "the wave - function therefore defines not one , but many different fractals , and is therefore said to be multifractal .",
    "multifractal wave - functions are strongly fluctuating on every length - scale , and their characterization requires an infinite number of fractal dimensions , called multifractal exponents ( mfes ) .",
    "an example of a multifractal wave - function is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qcd_eigvecs](b ) .",
    "multifractality is a known feature of critical eigenfunctions at the anderson metal - insulator transition  @xcite , that can be studied by means of multifractal finite - size scaling ( mfss )  @xcite . in recent high - precision calculations",
    "@xcite , mfss has been successfully employed to determine the mfes of critical eigenfunctions , as well as to obtain a more precise estimate of the critical disorder and of the critical exponents , for anderson models in different symmetry classes . in this work",
    "we want to perform a similar mfss analysis to study the anderson localization - delocalization transition in the spectrum of the dirac operator in qcd .",
    "in the remainder of this section we describe mfss in some detail .",
    "our methods and notations are essentially the same as in ref .  ,",
    "to which we refer the reader for a more detailed discussion .",
    "there is however one important difference , concerning the way in which the transition is approached . in ref .",
    "the transition was studied by looking at wave functions at the band center and varying the amount of disorder , @xmath18 . in qcd",
    "the amount of disorder is effectively set by the temperature , and it is more convenient to keep it fixed and study the transition as a function of energy , @xmath19 , by looking at wave - functions near the mobility edge , @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , @xmath18 has been replaced by @xmath19 in the expressions of ref .  .",
    "let us consider a @xmath21-dimensional cubic lattice of linear size @xmath22 , and a critical eigenfunction of a random hamiltonian , @xmath23 , defined on the lattice sites @xmath9 and normalized to 1 .",
    "we can divide the lattice into smaller boxes of linear size @xmath24 , and compute the probability corresponding to the @xmath25-th box as @xmath26 where the sum runs over the lattice sites contained in the @xmath25-th box . the generalized inverse participation ratios ( giprs )",
    "are the moments of the box probability .",
    "the giprs and their derivatives read @xmath27 where @xmath28 , and the sum runs over all the @xmath29 boxes of size @xmath24 . for small @xmath30 , the averages of @xmath31 and @xmath32 over disorder realizations follow a power - law behavior as a function of @xmath30 , which leads one to define the following exponents : @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 are generalized fractal dimensions , usually referred to as multifractal exponents ( mfes ) .",
    "one can similarly define mfes for localized and delocalized states by substituting critical eigenfunctions with localized or delocalized eigenfunctions in eq .  .",
    "in the delocalized / metallic part of the spectrum , states extend over the whole lattice , so their effective size grows proportionally to the volume , thus leading to @xmath36 . on the other hand , in the localized / insulating regime",
    ", states are exponentially localized , so that their effective size does not change with the system size , resulting in @xmath37 for @xmath38 , and @xmath39 for @xmath40 . at criticality , @xmath41 ,",
    "the eigenstates are instead expected to be multifractal , with nontrivial , @xmath42-dependent @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this jump of the mfes at the critical point happens only in an infinite system .",
    "the main idea of mfss is to use the mfes as order parameters for finite size - scaling . in order to do that we have to define the finite size version of the mfes at a given energy , @xmath43 where it is understood that wave - functions of energy around @xmath19 are used on the right - hand side , and where the superscript _ ens _ is to remind the reader that one has to perform _ ensemble _ averaging over the different disorder realizations . @xmath44 and @xmath45 are called generalized multifractal exponents ( gmfes ) .",
    "every gmfe approaches the value of the corresponding mfe at the critical point , @xmath41 , only in the limit @xmath46 .",
    "one can also define _ typical _ mfes , @xmath47 which can be used as well in a finite - size scaling analysis .",
    "however , as we said above , mfes are defined through _",
    "ensemble _ averaging in principle [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : multifractals_d_alpha ] ) ] , and when computing mfes in sec .",
    "[ sec : qcd_mfss ] we use _ ensemble _ averaged quantities only .    in the renormalization group language , the anderson transition is characterized by a single relevant operator  @xcite , and so in the vicinity of the critical point one can derive scaling laws for the gmfes , which can be summarized in a single equation , using a common letter , @xmath48 , for the gmfes : @xmath49 at the critical point , the localization length diverges as @xmath50^{-\\nu}$ ] , where @xmath51 for @xmath52 . the system sizes employed in this paper , however , are not big enough to justify the use of one - parameter scaling , and so we included the contribution of an irrelevant operator , @xmath53 , which leads us to write @xmath54 .",
    "\\label{eq : fss_anderson_scalinglaw_ll}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a second irrelevant term , proportional to @xmath55 , is expected to be less important and will be neglected in the analysis  @xcite",
    ".    fits to the numerical data are performed by expanding @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the variables @xmath58 and @xmath59 up to order @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "the number of parameters therefore grows as @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , @xmath63 and @xmath64 must also be expanded in powers of @xmath65 up to order @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which further increases the number of fitting parameters .",
    "the fit provides all the physically interesting quantities , namely the critical point , @xmath20 , the critical exponent , @xmath68 , the irrelevant exponent @xmath69 , and the mfe , @xmath70 .",
    "a simpler fit can be performed by setting @xmath71 to a fixed value . in this case , dropping @xmath30 from the notation , we can write @xmath72 having absorbed @xmath70 and the factor @xmath73 into new functions @xmath74 .",
    "the main advantage is that since @xmath74 are now single - variable functions , the number of expansion parameters grows only as @xmath75 .",
    "on the other hand , with this method one can determine only @xmath20 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , while the value of the mfe , @xmath70 , can not be obtained .",
    "in this section we give the relevant details about the dirac operator and qcd , and about how the qcd dirac spectrum can be studied by means of numerical simulations . the continuum euclidean dirac operator is @xmath76 where @xmath77 are the euclidean dirac matrices , @xmath78 is the coupling constant , and @xmath79 is the non abelian gauge field .",
    "more precisely , @xmath80 is a hermitian @xmath81 matrix , where @xmath82 is real and the sum runs over the generators @xmath83 of @xmath1 .",
    "the dirac operator is thus anti - hermitian , so admitting a straightforward interpretation as ( @xmath84 times ) the hamiltonian of a quantum system .",
    "the dirac operator is a chiral operator with the following structure in spinor space , @xmath85 with @xmath18 a complex matrix with no further symmetry  @xcite . as a random matrix model",
    ", the dirac operator in a random gauge field belongs therefore to the chiral unitary class .",
    "chiral symmetry is expressed by the anticommutation relation @xmath86 , which implies that the nonzero eigenvalues come in pairs @xmath87 .",
    "it is thus sufficient to consider the positive part of the spectrum only .",
    "the partition function of qcd at temperature @xmath4 can be expressed as a functional integral , @xmath88\\,e^{-s_{\\rm g}[a ] } \\prod_f\\det [ d(a ) + m_f ] \\,,\\ ] ] with the constraint @xmath89 .",
    "the product is over the six different types of quarks ( `` flavors '' ) , with @xmath90 the mass of quark @xmath91 . here",
    "$ ] is a positive functional of the gauge field , which together with the determinants provides the probability distribution of the disorder , i.e. , of the gauge field configurations .",
    "numerical simulations of qcd require the discretization of eq .   on a finite lattice . for a review of lattice",
    "qcd see , e.g. , ref .  .",
    "while the discretization of the gauge fields poses no particular problem , and can be performed preserving exact gauge invariance  @xcite , fermion fields are known to be more problematic , and the discretization of the dirac operator spoils some of the properties of its continuum counterpart .",
    "nevertheless , the discretization that we employed , namely staggered fermions  @xcite , preserves the anti - hermiticity and the symmetry of the spectrum with respect to the origin , and moreover preserves the chiral unitary symmetry class  @xcite .",
    "it must be noted at this point that in the case of the anderson model , chiral and non - chiral symmetry classes differ only in their properties near the band center  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath93 , while the properties of the bulk of the spectrum are similar .",
    "for example , the authors of ref .   found wigner - dyson statistics in the bulk spectrum of a three - dimensional chiral orthogonal disordered model .",
    "moreover , even the critical exponent of the orthogonal and of the chiral orthogonal class turn out to be the same , up to very high numerical precision  @xcite .",
    "we expect the same to be true for the multifractal exponents .",
    "let us now describe the numerical setting in some detail .",
    "qcd is discretized on a periodic hypercubic lattice @xmath94 , of spatial extent @xmath22 in each direction and temporal extent @xmath95 .",
    "the gauge fields @xmath79 are replaced by corresponding gauge links , i.e. , parallel transporters along each link of the lattice , which are elements of the gauge group , @xmath1 .",
    "the functional @xmath96 is discretized and expressed in terms of the gauge links , and the integration over gauge fields is replaced by the integration with the haar measure over gauge links , i.e. , over the gauge - group valued variables on the links .",
    "finally , the continuum dirac operator is replaced by the staggered dirac operator , which reads @xmath97\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath98 , and @xmath99 the gauge link connecting the lattice site @xmath100 to the neighboring site along direction @xmath101 .",
    "the staggered dirac operator carries only spacetime and color indices , i.e. , it has no spinorial structure .",
    "the eigenvalue equation @xmath102 must be supplemented with the antiperiodic boundary condition @xmath103 for the quark eigenfunction .",
    "as we have already remarked , the dirac operator can be viewed as a random hamiltonian , with disorder provided by the fluctuations of the gauge fields , and distributed according to the boltzmann weight appearing in the partition function . in its discretized version ,",
    "the dirac operator is a large sparse matrix , with nonzero random elements only in the off - diagonal , nearest - neighbor hopping terms , which depend on the parallel transporter on the corresponding link of the lattice .",
    "this resembles an anderson model with off - diagonal disorder , although here the fluctuations of the gauge links are correlated , rather than independent .",
    "however , since the theory has a mass gap , correlations decrease exponentially with the distance .",
    "moreover , the strong correlation between the different time - slices makes the model effectively three - dimensional , with the fluctuations of the temporal links acting effectively as a three - dimensional diagonal disorder  @xcite .",
    "the size of the gauge field fluctuations are determined by the temperature , which therefore is expected to play the same role as the amount of disorder in the anderson model .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that the temperature governs the position of the mobility edge .    in the present work",
    "we have studied the spectrum of the dirac operator by generating gauge link configurations , i.e. , realizations of disorder , by means of monte - carlo methods .",
    "numerical calculations were done on a gpu cluster . in our simulations",
    "we have included only the three lightest flavors ( up , down , and strange ) , with equal masses for the up and down quark .",
    "for many purposes , this is a good approximation of the real world .",
    "the lattice spacing in physical units was set to @xmath104 and the temporal size was fixed to @xmath105 ,",
    "resulting in the temperature @xmath106 , well above the crossover temperature ( see refs .   for more details ) .",
    "technical details about the numerical implementation and the scale - setting procedure can be found in refs .  .",
    "we have computed the eigenpairs of the dirac operator from the smallest eigenvalue up to the upper end of the critical region , on lattices of spatial sizes in the range @xmath107 ( in lattice units ) . a detailed list is reported in tab .",
    "[ tab : qcd_fss_systemsize ] along with the corresponding number of samples .",
    "the three - dimensional box probability , eq .  , required for the multifractal analysis , was constructed as follows . to have a gauge - invariant description we summed over the color components , labelled by @xmath108 . moreover , due to the strong correlation between the lattice time - slices , the eigenvectors of the dirac operator look qualitatively the same on each of them , so we can also sum over the time - slices , @xmath109 .",

    "our result for the critical point , @xmath115 , is compatible with the value reported in ref .   at the 2-@xmath116 level . on average ,",
    "the systematic error on @xmath20 is @xmath117 , so negligible compared to the statistical error .",
    "our result for the critical exponent , @xmath118 , agrees at the 1-@xmath116 level with the result of ref .  , and with previous results for the critical exponent of the unitary anderson model  @xcite . for this quantity",
    ", one has also to take into account that on average the systematic error due to truncation , @xmath119 , is of the same size as the statistical error . on the other hand ,",
    "our value for the irrelevant exponent , @xmath120 , is significantly different from the value of ref .",
    ", @xmath121 .",
    "it is well known that it is very difficult to determine irrelevant exponents accurately , and to explain this discrepancy further work and higher - quality data are needed .",
    "it is possible that for the system sizes presently available , more than one irrelevant term gives important contributions , so that our result for @xmath69 would be a sort of `` effective '' irrelevant exponent . in any case",
    "this point requires further analysis .    as a final remark",
    ", we note that since results for different @xmath42 are strongly correlated , there is no significance in the fact that our values for the critical point are systematically lower , and the ones for the critical exponent are systematically higher than the reference values .",
    "c c    mfes_alpha ( 0,74)(a )    &    mfes_d ( 0,74)(b )     +    the convergence of the fixed-@xmath30 mfss confirms the presence of a critical point in the qcd dirac spectrum where the system undergoes a true localization - delocalization transition , employing completely different observables than the ones used in ref .  .",
    "the results of our analysis also provide further evidence that the transition in the qcd dirac spectrum belongs to the universality class of the 3d unitary anderson model .",
    "moreover , despite the fact that it does not provide the values of the mfes , the convergence of this method also strongly indicates the presence of multifractality at the critical point .",
    "we next procedeed to apply the variable-@xmath30 method , in order to try and determine the multifractal exponents , and compare them to the ones obtained for the unitary anderson model .",
    "however , this method requires small values of @xmath30 to work properly , and is also more demanding as it is a two - variable fit .",
    "in practice , the @xmath122 ratio reached a value close to unity only if we left out the smallest system sizes , below @xmath123 , and if we used data corresponding to @xmath124 and @xmath125 only .",
    "although using @xmath123 and @xmath126 improved the convergence , the fits were still unstable against changing the expansion orders .",
    "this can be understood , as a similar amount of independent data is available as in the fixed-@xmath30 method , but there are many more parameters to fit , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : mfss ] . in order to be able to estimate the mfes",
    ", we then fixed the critical energy and the critical exponent to the values obtained with the fixed-@xmath30 method , @xmath127 and @xmath128 , in this way stabilizing the fits .",
    "the systematic uncertainty corresponding to this procedure was estimated by repeating the fits with @xmath20 and @xmath68 fixed to one of the four possible combinations of the values @xmath129 and @xmath130 , which are the lower and upper boundaries of the confidence interval of @xmath20 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "the largest and smallest values obtained in this way were then used as upper and lower error bar on the mfes .",
    "we experienced that the main source of uncertainty comes from the choice of @xmath20 , while fits are much less sensitive to the choice of @xmath68 .",
    "moreover , statistical errors ( estimated by monte - carlo ) and systematic errors due to truncation were comparatively negligible .",
    "the results of this procedure are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : qcd_fitres_mfes ] .",
    "a set of nontrivial mfes was obtained , thus providing direct evidence of the multifractality of the critical eigenfunctions of the qcd dirac operator . moreover , our results for the mfes in qcd are compatible with the ones obtained in the unitary anderson model , which further confirms that the transition belongs to the chiral unitary anderson class .",
    "we investigated the anderson transition in the spectrum of the dirac operator of qcd at high temperature , found by the authors of ref .  .",
    "while that work made use of spectral statistics , our aim in this paper was to examine the transition by studying the eigenvectors , and their multifractal properties at the critical energy .",
    "the results of ref .   for the correlation length critical exponent suggested that the anderson transition in qcd belongs to the same universality class as the three - dimensional unitary anderson model .",
    "we therefore looked for more similarities between these models .",
    "first we examined the correlations between eigenvectors of a given gauge configuration .",
    "we found strong correlations between eigenmodes of the qcd dirac operator , decreasing with energy separation in a similar way as in the unitary anderson model .",
    "we then performed two multifractal finite - size scaling ( mfss ) analyses , one with fixed ratio @xmath30 of the coarse - graining box size to the system size , and one with variable @xmath30 .",
    "mfss with the fixed-@xmath30 method allowed an alternative determination of the critical point and of the critical exponent , which is in agreement with the findings of ref .  , and , for the critical exponent , with those of refs .   for the unitary anderson model .",
    "to perform mfss with the variable-@xmath30 method and determine the multifractal exponents ( mfes ) , we performed fits fixing the critical energy and the critical exponent to the values obtained with the fixed-@xmath30 method .",

    "morever , we have shown that the critical wave - functions of the dirac operator are multifractals .",
    "the physical consequences of the qcd anderson transition and of multifractality still largely need to be explored , and may lead in particular to a better understanding of the qcd chiral transition .",
