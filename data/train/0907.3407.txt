    "due to their large masses , heavy flavor ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) quarks are produced in the early stages of heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "a precise measurement of heavy flavor production could be achieved by identifying the decay of charmed mesons using direct topological reconstruction and thus disentangling the @xmath2 and @xmath3 contributions .",
    "the hft has the necessary resolution for such a measurement that requires high precision .",
    "it is the assembly of the existing silicon strip detector ( ssd ) and 2 new detecting devices : the intermediate silicon tracker ( ist ) and the pixel detector .",
    "the pixel is composed by 2 layers of monolithic cmos active pixel sensors @xcite which measure with great accuracy the position of a particle within a few centimeters of the interaction region .",
    "these very thin layers minimize the multiple coulomb scaterring .",
    "the intermediate tracking system is made by the ist and the existing ssd ( table [ tab : fit - res ] ) .",

    "simulations presented in this proceedings were performed using the full star geometry package with 10k auau hijing central events at @xmath4 = 200 gev embedded with @xmath5 and @xmath6 particles , forced to decay to their hadronic channels ( @xmath5@xmath7@xmath8@xmath9 , @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8@xmath10 ) .",
    "their reconstruction efficiencies are based on particle identification of daughter particles provided by the tpc and extended to higher @xmath0 with the time of flight detector ( tof ) : @xmath11-@xmath12 and ( @xmath11+@xmath12)-@xmath13 separations were done up to @xmath0 @xmath14 1.6 gev / c and @xmath0 @xmath14 3 gev / c , respectively .",
