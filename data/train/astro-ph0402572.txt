    "the twin 8-m telescopes of gemini observatory are located in hawaii in the northern hemisphere , and chile in the southern hemisphere .",
    "both telescopes are being outfitted with mid - infrared cameras / spectrometers , thus allowing observers the unique opportunity to apply for all - sky observations of mid - infrared targets .",
    "another way in which gemini sets itself apart from other 8-m class telescope facilities is its optimization for infrared observations .",
    "ideally , a mirror coating should reflect as close to 100% of the light that strikes it . in the thermal infrared region of the spectrum , however , a mirror coating emits a great deal of infrared radiation , and the statistical noisiness of this emission reduces an infrared instrument s sensitivity to astronomical sources .",
    "the emissivity of an optical surface is defined as the ratio between its level of emission and that of a perfect blackbody emitter , and it is roughly the inverse of the reflectivity .",
    "therefore , in order to maximize infrared sensitivity , the mirror emissivity must be as low as possible .",
    "the gemini telescopes employ single monolithic primary mirrors , rather than segmented ones whose intersegment gaps increase overall telescope emissivity .",
    "furthermore , gemini plans on coating primary and secondary mirror surfaces of both telescopes with silver ( rather than the usual aluminum ) .",
    "silver has a much lower emissivity than aluminum in the infrared , translating to unprecedented sensitivities for gemini s infrared instruments .",
    "gemini south s secondary mirror is already coated in silver , yielding a total system emissivity of 3.0% at 9 @xmath1 m . in may of 2004 , the primary mirror of gemini south will also be coated in silver , bringing the total emissivity down to an estimated 2.2% or below .",
    "gemini north also plans to be fully silver coated by the end of 2005 .",

    "the detector in michelle is a raytheon 320@xmath2240 pixel si : as ibc array with wavelength coverage of 7 to 26 @xmath1 m .",
    "it also has a switchable well capacity , and is used in deep - well mode for all imaging and medium - well mode for all spectroscopy .",
    "gemini north and is still undergoing characterization and commissioning of the spectroscopic modes of michelle , however during the 2003b semester the instrument made its first imaging queue observations for the community .",
    "michelle will be at ukirt during 2004a , and afterwards it will return to gemini for the foreseeable future .",
    "the low- , medium- , and high - resolution spectroscopic modes of michelle will be available to the public for semester 2004b , and the echelle mode is expected to be available in 2005 .",
    "with their versatile mid - infrared observing capabilities , t - recs and michelle will empower astronomers with the tools needed to explore the nature of a broad range of astronomical objects and environments .",
    "the large infrared - optimized collecting area provided by the state - of - the - art gemini telescopes , coupled with the large throughputs and excellent optics of t - recs and michelle , are a powerful combination that will surely advance the field of mid - infrared astronomy .",
