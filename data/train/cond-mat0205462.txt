    "the discovery of coexistence of superconductivity and weak ferromagnetism in rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( ru-1212 ) @xcite has triggered a large number of studies of the properties of this material . from all these studies it becomes obvious , that the preparation method plays a very important role , in particular as far as the superconducting properties of the compound are concerned .",

    "the exact temperature of this transition depends on the applied field and decreases slightly from 137  k at 0.25  mt to 134  k at 10  mt .",
    "although it was originally believed , that this transition is due to ferromagnetic ordering of the ru moments , powder neutron diffraction studies @xcite revealed an antiferromagnetically ordered state of the ru moments and put a limit of about 0.1  @xmath19 per ru on any ferromagnetic component .",
    "the presence of a ferromagnetic component is indicated by hysteresis loops in m - h curves measured in the magnetically ordered state @xcite . for these results to be consistent with the neutron diffraction data , the antiferromagnetically ordered ru moments must be canted to give a net magnetic moment .",
    "this canting is thought to be associated with rotations of the ruo@xmath2-octahedra @xcite .",
    "the zero field cooled ( z.f.c.)-field cooled ( f.c . ) hysteresis observed for our m - t curves in the magnetically ordered state presumably arises @xcite from an increased canting of the ru moments due to the presence of the external magnetic field in the f.c .",

    "[ fig : dc]a , distinct anomalies of the magnetization are observed upon entering the superconducting state .",
    "the magnetization shows a clear increase at 25  k and reaches a peak at 15  k. in a low field ( 0.25  mt ) , the magnetization decreases below 15  k because of the field expulsion due to superconductivity .",
    "while the flux expulsion does not saturate down to our lowest measuring temperature , probably due to the small grain size ( @xmath20 ) or possibly due to undetected sample imhomogeneity , it should be noted , that the signal corresponds to a complete flux expulsion from 25% of the sample volume . at 1  mt",
    "this peak is still observed but its height has decreased and at 10  mt no peak is present ( although the curves show a cusp at low temperatures ) and the flux expulsion characteristic of a superconductor entering the meissner state has disappeared .",
    "similar anomalies have also been observed by klamut _",
    "their sample had a slightly higher superconducting transition temperature of 35  k and the peak of the magnetization was observed at a higher temperature , above 25  k. in @xcite two proposals were made , without further analysis , for the interpretation of the observed anomaly in the d.c .",
    "magnetization curve : ( a ) in terms of a change of the magnetic ordering of the ru moments upon entering the superconducting state and ( b ) in terms of an anomalous flux lattice behavior .",
    "it appears noteworthy , that such magnetization features have not been observed in all studies of superconducting ru-1212 @xcite . in our case",
    ", we take into account the information , that ru moments order antiferromagnetically in 2116 compounds @xcite and the fact , that we used sr-2116 as a precursor material for the preparation of ru-1212 .",
    "thus , we decided to investigate the possibility , that the anomalies are due to sr-2116 impurities , which could have been present in our ru-1212 samples as a second phase in an amount @xmath10 3 % , in accordance with our x - ray results .",

    "the curves consist of a high temperature paramagnetic regime , where , as expected , the magnetization is a linear function of the magnetic field ( _ c.f . _ figure  [ fig : hyst]b ) . at lower temperatures , a small anomaly of the magnetization",
    "is observed between 35  k and 30  k. the position of this cusp - like feature is marked by an arrow in figure  [ fig:2116dc ] and in figure  [ fig : lowtmag ] , where it is more clearly visible . from our low temperature structure data ( figure  [ fig : xray]b ) we can exclude the possibility , that this slight cusp is related to a structural transition .",
    "below 30  k , the magnetization begins to increase rapidly and reaches a peak at 18  k. a second peak of the magnetization is observed below 3  k , as shown in the inset of figure  [ fig:2116dc ] .",
    "the temperature at which this second peak is observed is similar to the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature of the gd moments in ru-1212 , as determined by neutron diffraction @xcite and d.c .",
    "magnetization studies @xcite .",
    "in order to exclude the possibility , that this second peak at 3  k or the cusp above 30  k are due to the trace impurities of cubic gd@xmath0o@xmath8 present in the sr-2116 sample , we also studied the magnetic properties of the gd@xmath0o@xmath8 powder used for sample synthesis ( chempur 99.99  % pure ) .",
    "no transition was observed down to the lowest temperature investigated ( 1.6  k ) in accordance with the report by moon and koehler @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : lowtmag ] shows , that the position of the cusp - like anomaly between 35  k and 30  k as well as that of the increase of the magnetization at 30  k are rather independent of magnetic field , while the position of the peak slightly shifts from 18  k at 0.25  mt down to 14  k at 35  mt and the magnetization decrease below the peak temperature becomes less pronounced .        at 50  mt , the peak has disappeared and a ferromagnetic - like curve is observed . a f.c .",
    "magnetization curve taken at 200  mt ( not shown ) between 7  k and 300  k appears paramagnetic - like throughout the whole temperature range but the cusp in the 35 - 30  k temperature range is again clearly visible .",
    "the hysteresis between the z.f.c .",
    "curves ( figure  [ fig:2116dc ] ) is reminiscent of that observed for ru-1212 and indicates , that sr-2116 is not a simple antiferromagnet .",
    "as proposed for ru-1212 , such a behavior could be caused by a canted arrangement of the spins giving rise to a net magnetic moment .",
    "the presence of a ferromagnetic component is indicated by the hysteresis loop obtained at 16  k , which is shown in figure  [ fig : hyst]a . using the remanent magnetization as a measure of the spontaneous ferromagnetic moment",
    "this is @xmath21 per formula unit .",
    "we should note , that for the measurement in figure  [ fig : hyst]a the field was changed between 6 and -6  t. for clarity only the low field part of the measurement is presented .",
    "+     a possible scenario for the explanation of these observations is the following : at about 35  k the expected @xcite antiferromagnetic ordering of the ru moments takes place .",
    "presumably , this corresponds to the 31  k ordering temperature of the ru moments in sr-2116 reported in literature @xcite .",
    "a canting of the ru moments creates an internal field , which at about 30  k polarizes the gd moments leading to the observed rapid increase of the magnetization shown in figure  [ fig:2116dc ] . at about 18  k ,",
    "gd - gd antiferromagnetic interactions start to dominate over this polarizing effect and the magnetization decreases .",
    "the ordering of the gd moments takes place at about 3  k.    this interpretation of the data is consistent with a scenario proposed in @xcite in order to explain the magnetic properties of gd@xmath0cuo@xmath22 , where cu orders antiferromagnetically at 260  k. here , the canting of the cu moments polarizes the gd moments at about 100  k. below 20  k , gd - gd interactions begin to dominate , while the actual antiferromagnetic ordering of the gd moments , as indicated by specific heat and magnetization measurements , occurs at 6.5  k. in an applied magnetic field , the peak at 20  k is shifted to lower temperatures , similar to our results on sr-2116 presented in figure  [ fig : lowtmag ] , and finally merges with the one at 6.5  k , which is associated to the antiferromagnetic ordering of the gd moments .    in a study of a series of cu - doped 2116 compounds @xcite superconductivity",
    "was observed , which appears to coexist with antiferromagnetic order of ru@xmath3 ions .",
    "a sharp increase of the susceptibility at 30  k similar to that in figure  [ fig:2116dc ] was interpreted as the signature of ferromagnetic ordering due to double exchange between ru ions of different valencies @xcite .",
    "double exchange was introduced by zener @xcite and in recent years represents a standard approach for the explanation of the transport and magnetic properties of the colossal magnetoresistance manganites , such as la@xmath23sr@xmath24mno@xmath4 .",
    "there , the transfer of electrons through an oxygen ion between mn ions of different valencies , namely 3 + and 4 + , created through partial substitution of the trivalent la by divalent sr , gives rise to a ferromagnetic coupling between these ions . in the 2116 compounds",
    "it was proposed , that partial doping with cu , likely to be in the 3 + state , promotes the formation of ru@xmath25 ions .",
    "the double exchange mechanism would then involve ru@xmath3 and ru@xmath25 ions .    in the case of sr-2116 studied here ,",
    "it is difficult to visualize the origin of double exchange since no cu doping is involved . on the other hand , donohue and mccann @xcite , who prepared sr-2116 compounds in a way similar to ours , report , that their sample was oxygen deficient with a composition of sr@xmath0gdruo@xmath26 .",
    "such a deficiency on the oxygen site could create ru ions of different valencies and give rise to double exchange .",
    "oxygen uptake during a heat treatment in oxygen atmosphere is then expected to affect the magnetic properties of such samples .",
    "following these ideas , we have treated the sr-2116 sample used for the magnetization measurements presented in figures  [ fig:2116dc]-[fig : hyst ] for 5  days at 1060  @xmath9c in flowing oxygen .",
    "this treatment equals the second step in the preparation of ru-1212 as described above ( section  [ sec : exp ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : oxy ] a pair of m - t curves is shown , which were taken after the oxygen treatment .",
    "it is obvious , that although all the features of the curves described so far are retained and the f.c .",
    "curve remains almost unchanged , the height of the z.f.c .",
    "peak is significantly reduced .",
    "incorporation of oxygen to the sample would lead to a change of the valency of ru ions towards the expected one of 5 + .",
    "this would then suppress double exchange .",
    "a change of the valency of some ru ions after the oxygen treatment would also change the ru - gd interactions in the sample .",
    "this could explain why the peak shown in the inset of figure  [ fig:2116dc ] , tentatively associated with gd - moment ordering , appears now ( figure  [ fig : oxy ] ) to be shifted to a lower temperature @xmath27 .",
    "the interaction of the ru and gd sublattices in ru-1212 was recently discussed in @xcite .    on the basis of the above interpretation",
    ", the peak at 18  k must be related to the antiferromagnetic ordering of the ru@xmath3 moments .",
    "this is inconsistent with the reported @xcite transition temperature . within this scenario ,",
    "the origin of the cusp in the magnetization curve between 30 and 35  k is unclear .",
    "it must also be mentioned , that the suppression of the z.f.c .",
    "magnetization seen in figure  [ fig : oxy ] could be related to a change in the morphology of the sample due to the long annealing times in flowing oxygen . in ru-1212",
    "@xcite for example , the ratio of the domains with opposite sense of ruo@xmath2-octahedra rotation is assumed to depend on the annealing of the sample .",
    "in view of the results presented so far it is very tempting to interpret the anomalies of the d.c .",
    "magnetization of ru-1212 upon entering the superconducting state in terms of sr-2116 impurities in the sample .",
    "the magnetization of sr-2116 is similar to that of the anomalies of ru-1212 and the temperatures of the magnetization peak observed for the two compounds differ only by about 3  k. a quantitative comparison can be done based on the mass susceptibilities or the magnetization per gram of the sample used for the measurements presented in figure  [ fig : dc ] , which may be supposed to be of unknown composition . the z.f.c .",
    "moment of sr-2116 measured in a field of 0.25  mt ( figure  [ fig:2116dc ] ) is about @xmath29 , while the peak increase above the z.f.c .",
    "`` plateau '' in the sample of figure  [ fig : dc]a reaches @xmath30 . in order to explain the z.f.c .",
    "anomaly observed in this sample in terms of sr-2116 impurities one would thus need a mass of the impurity , which would correspond to 2.9/1.72 times the sample mass , which , of course , is impossible .",
    "different estimates are reached , if a stronger moment of the sr-2116 impurity is assumed , as detailed below .    on the basis of the assumption ,",
    "that double exchange is causing the rapid increase of the magnetization for sr-2116 at 30  k one might argue , that possible sr-2116 impurities in the ru-1212 sample have higher oxygen deficiencies than the sample of figure  [ fig:2116dc ] , which would give rise to more pronounced magnetization peaks without requiring large amounts of sr-2116 impurities .",
    "one should keep in mind though , that possible impurities underwent an oxygen treatment during the last step of the preparation of ru-1212 . according to the result presented in figure  [ fig : oxy ]",
    "this would suppress double exchange .",
    "other impurities , that could be responsible for the observed magnetization peaks in the ru-1212 sample are ru - deficient sr-2116 or cu - doped sr-2116 .",

    "the actual antiferromagnetic ordering of gd takes place at about 3  k. an alternative ( less likely ) scenario for the explanation of the data based on double exchange between ru ions of different valencies was also presented .",
    "in addition to ( nominally ) stoichiometric sr-2116 , the magnetization of ru - deficient and cu - doped sr-2116 compounds was also measured ; no indication for superconductivity of the cu doped sr-2116 compound was found in d.c .",

    ", an open question is why this low temperature peak in the magnetization curve of ru-1212 is not observed @xcite in all d.c .",
    "magnetization studies of ru-1212 .",
    "a more detailed investigation of the magnetic properties of ru-1212 samples similar to that presented in section  [ sec : resa ] of this paper , which could provide an answer to this question and clarify the origin of the observed peaks , is now in progress and details will be published in the near future .",
