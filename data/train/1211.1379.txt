    "as the largest bound systems in the universe , galaxy clusters carry imprints of cosmic growth via the distribution and motion of their surrounding dark matter and galaxies  ( see * ? ? ?",

    "they can therefore play a powerful role in testing theories for the origin of cosmic acceleration , complementing geometrical probes such as supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations . the key uncertainty in this approach is calibration of the relation between cluster observables  ( e.g. , x - ray luminosity or temperature , optical galaxy richness , sunyaev  zeldovich decrement ) and halo mass .",
    "stacked weak lensing has emerged as a robust approach to this problem because it is unaffected by the baryonic physics of the intracluster gas  ( @xcite 2006 ; @xcite 2009 ; @xcite 2012 , see @xcite 2012 for a review of this approach in the broader context of dark energy studies ) .",
    "galaxy infall patterns  @xcite offer an alternative probe of cluster mass profiles , which may prove a valuable complement to weak lensing if it can be implemented in a way that is insensitive to uncertainties of galaxy formation physics .",
    "the redshift  space cluster  galaxy cross",
    " correlation function , @xmath3 , is a comprehensive characterization of the statistical relation between clusters and galaxies , influenced by both the real  space cross  correlation and the peculiar velocities induced by the cluster gravitational potential .",
    "this paper is the first of a three - part series which will describe the modeling of @xmath3 and investigate its diagnostic power for cluster mass calibration and constraining cosmology .    in cluster ",
    "centric coordinates , the average galaxy kinematics are the result of competition between the cluster potential and hubble expansion . at small distances ,",
    "virial motion dominates , making the galaxy distribution elongated along the line - of - sight  ( los ) direction  ( a.k.a . the `` fingers - of - god '' effect ; fog )  @xcite . at larger distances ,",
    "the galaxy kinematics become dominated by radial infall , with a typical turn  around radius of several @xmath6 , ] where the characteristic infall velocity is equal to the hubble flow .",
    "this coherent infall produces a squashing distortion in @xmath3 at large scales , often referred to as the kaiser effect  ( @xcite 1987 ; see also  @xcite 1977 ) .",
    "these two redshift space distortion  ( rsd ) effects  ( see @xcite 1998 for a pedagogical review ) are also seen in the redshift ",
    "space galaxy auto  correlation functions  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) , but since galaxies feel a much stronger central potential near clusters than in the field , both small scale dispersion and large scale infall are strongly enhanced in the @xmath3 case .",
    "the strong rsd in @xmath3 allows reconstruction of the average galaxy kinematics around clusters , which are in turn determined by the average cluster mass profiles . for clusters of fixed mass @xmath7 , @xmath8 at projected separation @xmath9 and los separation @xmath10",

    "correlation function @xmath11 with the los velocity distribution function @xmath12  @xcite , @xmath13 \\ast \\fvlos , \\label{eqn : convolution}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the los separation in real space .",
    "the real  space @xmath11 has a roughly power  law form , so the strongest features in @xmath3 arise largely from @xmath12 . in this paper , we first develop an analytic description of the average galaxy infall kinematics  ( gik ) around cluster ",
    "mass halos found in the millennium simulation  @xcite .",
    "we show that applying this model to equation  [ eqn : convolution ] accurately reproduces the simulated @xmath3 , and we show that the analysis can be reversed to infer the correct gik from measurements of @xmath8 . as an illustrative application to observed data",
    ", we measure @xmath3 for galaxy groups  @xcite identified in the sloan digital sky survey  ( sdss ; @xcite 2000 ) and apply our model to infer the infall kinematics .    at small scales , the redshift  space distribution of @xmath3 depends mainly on the velocity dispersion profile of the virialized cluster component . at large separations , one must consider the mean radial velocity profile and the profiles of radial and tangential velocity dispersions .",
    "( in fact , we will show that the velocity distributions are significantly non  gaussian and exhibit internal correlations , all of which must be modeled to describe @xmath3 accurately . )",
    "all four of these profiles can be reconstructed from our @xmath3 modeling techniques , and all four of them provide diagnostics of cluster mass .",
    "we are particularly hopeful that the mean radial flow will prove to be a tool for inferring average mass profiles that is insensitive to galaxy formation physics .",
    "the cluster velocity dispersion profile can be affected at the @xmath15 level by orbital anisotropy and potentially by other effects such as preferential destruction of galaxies that pass near the cluster center or incomplete relaxation of substructures .",
    "the velocity dispersions of galaxies within infalling halos may also be affected by biases arising from galaxy formation physics .",
    "however , the mean velocity of galaxies in an infalling halo should , on average , match the mean velocity of the halo itself , as galaxies and dark matter are affected by the same gravitational potential .",
    "we will test this conjecture in future work .",
    "around individual clusters , the galaxy distribution in the ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) plane shows a distinctive trumpet  shaped pattern , and the distribution in @xmath10 at fixed @xmath9 often shows a caustic  like discontinuity  @xcite .",
    "n - body simulations suggest that the caustic location provides a direct measure of the escape velocity profile , which can in turn be converted to a cluster mass profile  ( @xcite 1999 ; see @xcite 2011 for the current state of the art ) . @xcite",
    "have used this technique to infer cluster mass profiles extending beyond the virial radius  ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , measurements for any individual cluster are affected by galaxy shot noise and by departures from spherical symmetry  @xcite , and it is not clear whether averaging measurements from multiple clusters will yield an unbiased mean result .",
    "our initial motivation for this study was , in part , to generalize the `` caustic method '' to the case where an overlapping cluster survey and galaxy redshift survey provide a large total number of cluster  galaxy pairs , even though the numbers around an individual cluster may be too small for caustic detection .",
    "although we will draw connections between @xmath3 and the trumpet  shaped patterns of the caustic method , our approach ultimately does not rely on finding discontinuities in the data or identifying them with the escape velocity profile .",
    "instead it relies on the general predictions of velocity distributions around massive halos in cosmological n - body simulations .",
    "previous analyses of @xmath3 include the study of  @xcite using apm galaxy clusters and the study of  @xcite using velocity dispersion profiles of groups in the sdss . both studies assume gaussian los velocity distributions with a mean radial infall profile .",
    "here we adopt a more comprehensive approach to model not only the first two moments of velocity distributions , but the full gik from the inner @xmath16 to scales beyond @xmath17 .",
    "one can imagine two somewhat different ways to go from gik modeling of @xmath3 to constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "one is to calibrate the average masses of clusters in bins of cluster observables , then combine this calibration with cluster counts to extract cosmological constraints via the halo mass function , analogous to approach of @xcite using stacked weak lensing .",
    "the second is to extract constraints directly from @xmath3 itself , marginalizing over uncertainties in galaxy bias .",
    "our primary goals in this paper are to understand the physical origin of the features in @xmath3 and develop a method for inferring gik statistics from @xmath3 measurements . in the second paper of this series",
    "we will investigate gik as a method for measuring mean cluster mass profiles , with particular attention to galaxy bias effects . in the third paper",
    "we will investigate the cosmological information that can be derived from @xmath3 , in comparison to and combination with cluster weak lensing  @xcite .    in the context of standard dark energy models , @xmath3 and stacked",
    "weak lensing analyses involve different types of systematic uncertainties . in the context of modified gravity theories of cosmic acceleration",
    ", they also provide distinct information .",
    "gravitational lensing and the motions of non  relativistic tracers are affected by different combinations of gravitational potentials , which are equal in gr but unequal in many modified gravity theories  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , transitions between `` unshielded '' and `` shielded '' regimes of modified gravity can produce distinctive features in the density and velocity fields around clusters  @xcite , which may reveal themselves as unusual features in @xmath3 .",
    "we will investigate this sensitivity to alternative gravity theories in future work .",
    "we begin our study by characterizing the gik mass halos in the millennium simulation with a compact analytic description . in  [ sec : xicgs ] we show that the gik model , in combination with the real  space @xmath11 , accurately reproduces the millennium @xmath3 . in ",
    "[ sec : mcmcmill ] we show that the gik parameters can be reconstructed from measurements of @xmath3 , and in  [ sec : mcmcsdss ] we apply our methodology to measurements of @xmath3 for sdss groups .",
    "we summarize our results and discuss prospects for this approach in  [ sec : con ] .",
    "to investigate the average galaxy velocity distribution as a function of cluster  centric radius , we make use of the semi  analytic model  ( sam ) galaxies inside the millennium simulation  @xcite , which evolves @xmath19 dark matter particles with @xmath20 in a periodic box 500@xmath6 on a side .",
    "the underlying cosmological model is inflationary cold dark matter with a cosmological constant  ( @xmath21cdm ) , though the values of the matter density @xmath22 and power spectrum normalization @xmath23 are somewhat high compared to current estimates .",
    "the sam galaxies are then constructed by assigning an empirical galaxy formation recipe along the merger trees of dark matter halos  @xcite . since the galaxy kinematics are primarily determined by the long  range gravitational forces that are unaware of the detailed baryonic physics inside galaxies",
    ", we can mostly treat the kinematics of galaxies and their host sub  halos as equal .",
    "the only exception is within the cluster virial radius , where the prescriptions for dynamical friction may alter the kinematics of galaxies after their host sub ",
    "halos fail to survive above the resolution limit of simulation because of tidal truncation  @xcite .",
    "the particular dynamical friction prescription adopted in  @xcite uses a variant of the classic formula from  @xcite to calculate the friction time scale . after this time scale , galaxies are assumed to merge onto the central galaxies of the main halo .",
    "the uncertainties in the dynamical friction time scale are significant , but they only affect the very inner region that our analysis is insensitive to . therefore , we believe the galaxy kinematics measured from the sam sample are representative of @xmath21cdm+general relativity  ( gr ) models",
    ". we will comment on the potential impacts of different dynamical friction prescriptions on our gik model in paper ii .    to obtain a decent signal - to - noise ratio , we select sam galaxies with absolute sdss @xmath24-band magnitude @xmath25 at @xmath26 , which produces a sample size of @xmath27 galaxies",
    ". we also repeated our kinematics measurements using a brighter sample with @xmath28 and found negligible differences except for relatively larger noise .",
    "we nonetheless will investigate the dependence of gik on galaxy type and luminosity in paper ii .",
    "we selected clusters in six mass bins with @xmath29 dex in bin width , which corresponds to at most @xmath30 difference in mass , and @xmath31 difference in overall velocity amplitude within each bin  ( assuming characteristic velocities @xmath32 ) .",
    "the narrow bin width ensures that the scatter we measure in the galaxy velocities within each mass bin is intrinsic , instead of extrinsic scatter induced by the scatter in cluster masses within that bin .",
    "the mass bins are indicated by the top left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : parfit ]  ( discussed further below ) .",
    "the clusters are identified by spherical overdensity in the simulation , and the cluster mass @xmath33 is defined as the mass inside a sphere with enclosed density @xmath34 times the mean matter density @xmath22 . throughout our analysis , we choose our fiducial mass bin to be @xmath35 .",
    "[ fig : xirsdemo ] compares three different ways of illustrating the average distribution of galaxies around clusters in redshift space , using our fiducial cluster mass bin as an example .",
    "the left panel simply shows the stacked number counts in cells of equal area on the redshift@xmath9 plane .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , this resembles the traditional way in which the `` caustic '' curve is identified for individual clusters  we can see an enhancement of the galaxy number distribution at small redshift separations forming the trumpet - shaped pattern . at small @xmath9 ,",
    "the galaxy distribution is stretched along the los by virial motions , but at @xmath36 it is highly compressed along the los by infall . while there are strong gradients in @xmath10 at each @xmath9 , there is not an obvious line of discontinuity , perhaps because caustics of individual clusters are washed out by scatter in the stack .",
    "note that although the cells in this representation have equal area , those at large @xmath9 have larger volumes in 3-dimensional redshift space because each cell represents a cylindrical ring with radius @xmath9  ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the middle panel shows the central quantity in this paper , the redshift  space cluster",
    " galaxy correlation function @xmath3 .",
    "since it is equivalent to the overdensity of galaxies around clusters , the dominant feature we see , other than the fog and kaiser effects , is the declining trend of overdensity with distance . to highlight the cluster rsd effects at fixed @xmath9 , in the right panel we plot the contours of @xmath38 , which is defined as the ratio between @xmath8 and the projected correlation function @xmath39 at given @xmath9 . since @xmath39 is the integral of @xmath3 along @xmath10 at fixed @xmath9 , . in practice",
    ", we cut off the integration at @xmath40 . ]",
    "the ratio @xmath38 has no information that is not already in @xmath3 , but by scaling out the radial trend it highlights the rsd effects .",
    "the highest peak for @xmath38 is no longer at the origin  ( i.e. , cluster center ) , but migrates horizontally to the region around @xmath41 , meaning that the relative distribution of galaxies along @xmath10 is the most compact at @xmath42 and becomes more spread at both small and large scales .",
    "the yellow solid curve in the right panel quantifies this compactness  it shows the characteristic los distance @xmath43 at which the amplitude of @xmath38 drops by @xmath44 from @xmath45 at each @xmath9 .",
    "the curve has a characteristic u - shape , indicating a more compact distribution of galaxies at intermediate projected radii .",
    "note that because @xmath46 at each @xmath9 , this u - shaped curve would occupy the same locus in the @xmath3 plot of the middle panel , although we do not show it there .    what determines the location of this characteristic u - shaped curve ?",
    "it bears some resemblance to the caustic curve for individual clusters , where the fall  off of the galaxy distribution on the redshift@xmath9 diagram is believed to be the natural boundary imposed by the escape velocities at different radii .",
    "indeed , in fig .",
    "[ fig : xirsdemo ] the u - shaped curve in the right panel is similar in shape to isodensity contours in the left panel , with the normalization by the mean expected galaxy number removing the somewhat arbitrary geometric weighting  ( @xmath47 ) of the straight number  count diagram",
    ". however , with no clear discontinuity in @xmath3 or @xmath38 , we can not relate this curve directly to escape velocities . to explain it quantitatively , we need to understand the average galaxy velocity distribution function around clusters , and in particular , @xmath12 .    for each mass bin of clusters , we stacked all the galaxies in the cluster ",
    "centric coordinate to produce a synthetic cluster of that mass bin .",
    "although individual clusters vary in shape and lumpiness , the synthetic clusters are isotropic and smooth by construction .",
    "therefore , in order to fully describe @xmath12 , we only need to measure the joint probability distribution function  ( pdf ) of radial velocity @xmath48 and `` half '' the tangential velocity component @xmath49 , at each radius @xmath24 , @xmath50 , so that @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 . here",

    "fig : coord ] ) . given an isotropic cluster ,",
    "this projected component is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is randomly distributed between @xmath58 and @xmath59 degrees , hence `` half '' of @xmath55 . to avoid redundancy ,",
    "hereafter we refer to @xmath54 simply as the `` tangential velocity '' .",
    "note that we subtract hubble flow when defining @xmath48 , and the probability distribution of @xmath54 is symmetric about zero .",
    "the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : v2dfit ] shows the measured @xmath60 for four radial bins that represent four distinctive regimes of gik around clusters .",
    "starting from the innermost radial bin  ( @xmath61 ) , the joint velocity distribution appears to be a single component ellipse with the major axis in the radial velocity direction , indicating a preference for radially oriented orbits that may arise from galaxies on first infall or second passage , whose velocity directions have not been randomized  @xcite .",
    "going slightly further out  ( @xmath62 ) , the joint distribution is clearly resolved into two parts , one virialized gaussian component with zero means of @xmath48 and @xmath54 , and one radial velocity  dominated component skewed toward negative radial velocities  ( infall ) . at @xmath63 , near the turn  around radius",
    "where infall velocity is comparable to hubble flow , the virialized component disappears while the infall component has a mean @xmath64 but no skewness .",
    "on very large scales ( @xmath65 ) , the joint distribution is still largely infall , but skewed toward positive velocities .",
    "the joint velocity distribution measured for any of the other radial bins is qualitatively similar to one of the four bins shown here , or some interpolation between two of them . to ensure an accurate description of @xmath12 at @xmath66 , where the measurements of @xmath3 are most precise , we need to model @xmath60 across all scales from the inner @xmath16 to beyond @xmath17 .    motivated by the top panels of fig .",

    ", @xmath89 controls the skewness of @xmath60 in the radial velocity direction , while @xmath75 adjusts the kurtosis in both directions , with lower @xmath75 corresponding to longer non  gaussian tails . since @xmath60 is symmetric in the tangential velocity axis",
    ", @xmath89 is reduced to one parameter @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath77 and @xmath78 describe the dispersion in each direction , and @xmath76 is the characteristic radial velocity .",

    "cosmological analyses can incorporate scatter and mis  centering into the model predictions and marginalize over uncertainties in their description . however , mis  centering effects must be calibrated for any given cluster finding algorithm and observational data set with detailed simulations .    as a probe of dark energy and modified gravity , gik modeling of galaxy clusters complements stacked weak lensing analysis in both observational requirements and information content .",
    "stacked weak lensing relies on overlap between a cluster sample and a deep imaging survey ; forecasts for stage iii and stage iv dark energy experiments predict cluster weak lensing constraints that are competitive with those from supernovae , baryon acoustic oscillations , and cosmic shear  ( see  @xcite 2012 ,  6 and  8.4 ) . gik analysis requires overlap with a large galaxy redshift survey , such as the sdss survey used here , the ongoing baryon acoustic oscillation spectroscopic survey  ( boss ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "<S> , we calibrate an analytic model of the galaxy kinematic profiles comprised of a virialized component with an isotropic gaussian velocity distribution and an infall component described by a skewed 2d @xmath1-distribution with a characteristic infall velocity @xmath2 and separate radial and tangential dispersions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that convolving the real - space cross - correlation function with this velocity distribution accurately predicts the redshift - space @xmath3 , and we show that measurements of @xmath3 can be inverted to recover the four distinct elements of the gik profiles . </S>",
    "<S> these in turn provide diagnostics of cluster mass profiles , and we expect the characteristic infall velocity @xmath4 in particular to be insensitive to galaxy formation physics that can affect velocity dispersions within halos . as a proof of concept we measure @xmath3 for rich galaxy groups in the sloan digital sky survey and recover gik profiles for groups in two bins of central galaxy stellar mass . </S>",
    "<S> the higher mass bin has a @xmath4 curve very similar to that of @xmath5 halos in the millennium simulation , and the recovered kinematics follow the expected trends with mass . </S>",
    "<S> gik modeling of cluster  galaxy cross  correlations can be a valuable complement to stacked weak lensing analyses , allowing novel tests of modified gravity theories that seek to explain cosmic acceleration .    galaxy : clusters : general  galaxies : kinematics and dynamics  cosmology : large - scale structure of universe </S>"
