    "soon after k.g . wilson s dramatic success in applying a momentum space formulation of the renormalization group ( rg ) method @xcite to the theory of critical phenomena and the kondo problem @xcite",
    "there was a considerable amount of efforts in applying the same type of approach as a real - space formulation to a variety of quantum physical problems .",
    "since the momentum space formulation , apart from a few exceptions , relies in most cases on a perturbative expansion , real - space methods offer non perturbative approaches and are therefore extremely important in applying rg ideas to strongly and complex correlated systems .",
    "it then turned out that for a variety of such physical models the real - space rg techniques give considerable bad results and the reason was unknown for nearly fifteen years . during that time",
    "some new real - space rg methods were discovered and some of them worked out very well whereas other methods failed without giving any insight to their failure .",
    "we like to refer the interested reader to the book of t.w .",
    "burkhardt and j.m.j .",
    "van leeuwen @xcite for a summary of work on this topic .",
    "+ apart from these developments s.r .",
    "white and r.m .",
    "noack published a series of papers containing a new idea for improving real - space rg techniques .",
    "based on the understanding of the importance of boundary conditions for isolated blocks in real - space rg methods for quantum physical systems a numerical approach was invented to take sufficiently many boundary conditions into account during the rg procedure . apart from the impressive accuracy of the numerical results this new approach displays also the typical universal character of a rg formulation , in that it is applicable with some particular changes for a variety of problems and was named the density matrix rg ( dmrg ) .",
    "+ the dramatic success of the dmrg method has changed the picture of real - space rg techniques completely and has been applied until now in very different fields of scientific research .",
    "the method itself is a rather complicated algorithm and a detailed description together with some examples is given by s.r .",
    "white @xcite . + despite of all the excitement concerning dmrg , the method has some important restrictions which are given by the method itself and therefore can not be removed by applying simple changes to the dmrg algorithm .",
    "here we mention the three main restrictions briefly :    1 .",
    "the chief limitation of dmrg is dimensionality .",
    "although higher dimensional variations are not forbidden in general , it becomes a complicated task .",
    "recent applications of dmrg to finite width strips in two dimensions show a declining accuracy with the width .",
    "therefore a successful approach for two dimensions in general or even higher dimension has never been worked out .",
    "dmrg is by definition an algorithm and therefore it is a purely numerical rg approach .",
    "although this needs not to be a disadvantage we like to have an analytical formulation of the dmrg method .",
    "in such a reformulation the numerical dmrg scheme will occur as one possible realization of a more general description .",
    "we therefore expect a deeper insight to successful working rg approaches .",
    "dmrg is restricted to zero temperature and is usually applied for calculating ground state properties like the ground state magnetization or even the ground state itself .",
    "finite temperature results were obtained only in the low lying spectrum but with very limited accuracy . in comparison to other real - space rg methods",
    "dmrg is different because it is designed to calculate ground state quantities .",
    "recently , based on the idea of xiang et al , a thermodynamic method was applied successfully , which combines white s dmrg idea with the _ transfer - matrix _ technique@xcite and which is now called tmrg . although tmrg is also purely numerical since it shares the basic idea with dmrg it is an even more complicated algorithm @xcite . due to the close relationship to dmrg ,",
    "the aim of tmrg is to give numerical accurate results for physical quantities and does not predict a rg flow - behaviour .",
    "in contrast our method is suited to calculate the flow - behaviour of the system , even analytically , although the main advantage by comparison with tmrg is the simple structure of our rg scheme .",
    "this makes it an easy task to apply it to a great variety of physical models .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows : in the next section we review the key idea of dmrg shortly .",
    "we begin by introducing the standard concepts of the real - space rg method in the language of spin chains in the way it was originally proposed . in section",
    "iii we present a rigorous formulation of a real - space rg transformation .",
    "each single block within the blocked chain is enlarged by an additional space , the auxiliary space .",
    "a single block together with its auxiliary space is called a superblock for which a real - space rg transformation is defined by integrating out the small spatial structure . constructing a global rg transformation for the complete quantum system from concatenation of the local superblock rg transformations",
    "leads to the definition of exact and perfect rg transformations . in section",
    "v we give some final remarks including the relation to previous approaches in this direction .",
    "applications in terms of this new formulation are shifted completely to a second paper .",
    "the very standard real - space rg approach is best explained for a spin hamiltonian @xmath0 on a one dimensional lattice as visualized in figure [ 1dchain ] .",
    "the dots represent the individual spins which are grouped together by breaking up the chain into blocks as visualized in figure [ blocks ] for a particular block composition of two sites .",
    "we like to establish a notation in which small letters refer to the single site spins and capital letters denote the blocks .",
    "the block hamiltonian for the block with the index @xmath1 is then denoted as @xmath2 .",
    "the idea of real - space rg is then to replace each block of the single spins by one effective _",
    "block - spin _ , which leads to a renormalized block - spin hamiltonian @xmath3 .",
    "the calculation of the block - spins from the blocks composed of single site spins is carried out by a _ rg transformation _",
    "@xmath4 , which can be defined in various ways @xcite , for example by projecting the block on the low lying spectrum @xcite . in summary",
    "a rg approach is designed to split of the whole system into subsystems called blocks for which it is possible to reduce the degrees of freedom .",
    "iterating this procedure leads to a _ rg flow _ in the parameter space of the model and the hope is to find a fixed point of this flow behaviour .",
    "such a fixed point hamiltonian is helpful to determine the universal behaviour of the physical model . +",
    "as explained in the introduction , the boundary conditions of a block within the quantum system are essential for the calculation of a _ rg step _ , which is defined as one application of the rgt .",
    "in fact the different boundary conditions represent the correlations in the quantum chain between adjacent blocks to which we refer in the following as _",
    "system blocks_. to provide the opportunity to choose those boundary conditions , which result in the most accurate representation of an isolated block , the fundamental idea of dmrg is to embed the system block into a `` bigger '' block , called _",
    "superblock_. this nomenclature as well as the term system block is due to the original work of s.r .",
    "white @xcite . in some sense",
    "this simulates the environment represented by the surrounding spin sites and effectively smoothes out the sharp effects of the boundary conditions , as depicted in figure [ superblock ] .",
    "+    to construct a working approach out of this overall picture we are immediately faced with a twofold basic problem : how can we describe the embedding of the system block within the superblock and how can one include the boundary conditions during a rg step . in the framework of dmrg these problems are overcome by focusing on one particular state , the _ target state _ @xmath5 , which is the ground state of the superblock hamiltonian obtained by diagonalization . by using a complete set of eigenstates of the system block @xmath6 and a complete set of eigenstates for the environment represented by the superblock @xmath7 we decompose the target state @xmath5 according to @xmath8 we are interested in those states , which lead to an optimal representation of the target state @xmath9 in a `` truncated '' basis .",
    "of course in this way we loose the exactness of relation ( [ dmrg3 ] ) and we therefore denote the new result as an _ optimal approximation _ expressed as @xmath10 where the _ optimal states _ @xmath11 are defined in terms of the original system block states by @xmath12 with some coefficients @xmath13 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath14 in ( [ dmrg4 ] ) can be determined by examining the _ reduced density matrix _ of the system block within the superblock @xcite .",
    "+ the twofold problem introduced above is therefore solved as follows : first the embedding of the system block within the superblock is achieved by reconstructing the target state of the superblock in a basis , in which the basis vectors are given as a tensor product composition of states of the system block and the chosen environment . in this way the system block is described within the bigger superblock .",
    "since we have not truncated the set of the states which belong to the environment , the rg step for the system block is performed by taking all possible boundary conditions within the selected environment into account .",
    "+ from the previous discussion it becomes obvious that the coefficients @xmath14 can only be determined numerically within real applications of this technique . to develop a complete analytic approach ,",
    "a method for using a target state will be impractical and we can only use the overall picture represented in figure [ superblock ] .",
    "we start this section by giving a very general but well known definition of a rg transformation ( rgt ) .",
    "a rgt @xmath4 is a map defined on a set of physical variables @xmath15 and a further set of parameters @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are not necessarily equal indexing sets and @xmath20 denotes the new set of blocked variables belonging to the larger scale .",
    "the quantitative prescription for the map ( [ transf1 ] ) is then given in physical terms by including physical constraints as for example the conservation of symmetries , the maintenance of the structure of the lagrangian or the hamiltonian , or the preservation of physical quantities , like for example the free energy of the system . since in most cases",
    "it is a difficult task to define a transformation which combines all needed constraints this has led to an enormous variety of approximate rg transformations developed in the last decades @xcite .",
    "+ the most common realization of the quantitative prescription is to apply the rg transformation @xmath4 to the lagrangian or the hamiltonian as a functional which then acts on the variables and parameters given in ( [ transf1 ] ) . in the special example of a one dimensional quantum spin chain the new variables are the block spins and the new coupling constant belongs to the _ renormalized _ set of parameters @xmath21 . for our case",
    "we generalize this rgt to an arbitrary suitable functional dependence @xmath22",
    "@xmath23    \\,=\\,{\\cal o}\\left(\\{{\\mu}_m\\ } , { \\bf k}'\\right)\\;.\\ ] ] by further mathematical analysis of a particular rgt @xmath4 defined by ( [ transf2 ] ) this hopefully yields to a dependence of the _ renormalized _ parameters @xmath21 on the old parameters @xmath24 which is called the _ flow behaviour _ of the rgt .",
    "we like to emphasize that once the functional dependence @xmath25 is known , we immediately know the functional dependence @xmath26 which plays an important role in our construction .",
    "+ we now make the ansatz that in principle each rgt @xmath4 can be written as a composition of two maps , called _ embedding _ and _ truncation _ @xcite .",
    "this terminology originates from a rg technique for hamiltonian systems @xcite , which was then further developed and used for calculations of the flow behaviour @xcite . rephrasing equation ( [ transf2 ] ) and focusing only on the renormalization of the set of parameters for determining the flow behaviour we get @xmath27 where we denote @xmath28 as the _ truncation map _ and @xmath29 as the",
    "_ embedding map_. + as a quite intuitive example for the abstract definition of the operators @xmath28 and @xmath29 , in the special case of a functional dependence given by the hamiltonian , we can construct @xmath28 as a projection map from the space of all eigenvectors of the hamiltonian to a space containing a reduced number of eigenvectors . a projection map from this truncated space back to the space containing all eigenvectors is a natural way of defining @xmath29 .",
    "although such an example illustrates a possible application of the abstract formulation given by ( [ transf4 ] ) it raises the question of which eigenstates are necessary to keep for constructing the truncated space . in the case of zero temperature",
    "we can argue that only those eigenvectors should be kept , which correspond to the low energy eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "as pointed out previously the idea of this paper should be to invent a real - space rg formulation which overcomes these limitations by a more abstract formulation .",
    "+ let us now assume that the functional dependence @xmath22 is given by some operator , not necessarily the hamiltonian , on the original hilbertspace @xmath30 so that equation ( [ transf4 ] ) can be written as the commuting diagram @xmath31 where @xmath32 refers to the effective hilbertspace for the functional dependence of the truncated set of parameters .",
    "+ we introduce the blocking concept discussed in the previous section as a tensor product decomposition of the hilbert space @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes some indexing set for the blocks .",
    "we are looking for an embedding and truncation map which respects the block decomposition by factorization @xmath35 using this mathematical formulation of the blocking scheme we like to write the rg transformation for a block in an analogous way @xmath36 due to ( [ grad2 ] ) .",
    "but equation ( [ grad3 ] ) is not an independent relation since we have to relate it to the _ global _ relation ( [ transf4 ] ) . to decompose ( [ transf4 ] ) into the blocked pieces ( [ grad3 ] ) we have to assume that the operator @xmath37 can be decomposed into commuting block operators @xmath38 which is not the case in general in quantum physics .",
    "therefore the problem encountered so far is to find suitable functions @xmath39 which respect the block decomposition of the hilbert space within the rgt .",
    "+ to find a solution for this problem our ansatz is to enlarge the hilbert space @xmath30 by an additional ( auxiliary ) hilbert space @xmath40 due to the composition rule @xmath41 we like to think of the space @xmath42 as some kind of super space and the global operator @xmath43 is then embedded into the total space @xmath42 .",
    "the key idea is to recover a block decomposition for @xmath43 into blocked pieces of the form @xmath44 which we identify as superblocks according to section [ dmrgintro ] .",
    "the next step in our approach following the basic principles of dmrg is to outline a general construction for @xmath43 with a commuting block decomposition .",
    "this can be performed explicitly by starting with standard real - space rg concepts .",
    "+ in the formulation of _ standard _ block rg we consider a decomposition of @xmath43 into disconnected block functions given by @xmath45 where we have neglected the non commutativity or",
    "_ correlations _ between the blocks completely . a straight forward way to improve the standard rg method",
    "is to include somehow the correlations between adjacent system blocks .",
    "as visualized in figure [ correlationblock ] we can refer to these correlations as blocks , which we denote therefore as _ correlation blocks_.    using these correlation blocks enables us to represent the non commutativities between the system blocks in a compact way and we denote these correlation blocks , using the overall notation given in the appendix , as @xmath46 @xmath47 the subspace @xmath48 denotes the tensor product composition of all the block hilbert spaces used for the construction of the correlation block .",
    "we are now dealing with the problem how to include these correlation blocks into the rg transformation .",
    "one can find approaches in the past where this is performed perturbatively @xcite and therefore unsuitable in our case . to find some insight into this problem",

    "we like to stress that the decomposition ( [ decom1 ] ) in sums of system blocks and correlation blocks is not unique .",
    "later we will examine another decomposition to which in contrast we will refer to as the product decomposition .",

    "+ it is apparent that only in the case of an exact rgt we are able to calculate global quantities like the total ground state energy shift . since we are mainly interested in an overall effective coupling determining the rg flow we are looking for exact rgts .",
    "we have invented a non perturbative quantum rg method based on the idea of an additional auxiliary space .",
    "the work was motivated by the success of the dmrg concerning numerical results and the open question of an underlying general mathematical framework .",
    "+ the main objects introduced in this article are the auxiliary space @xmath40 and the two maps @xmath69 and @xmath70 which generate the rgt . by using these quantities",
    "we were able to give the definition of an exact local rgt which is the final result of this work .",
    "an exact local rgt involves all the information provided by the physical system .",
    "+ in future work we will proceed by applying our abstract formalism presented here to quantum spin chains like the heisenberg models and compare our results in the context of related work on these models @xcite .",
    "this leads us to concrete and different examples of possible auxiliary spaces .",
    "as expected , the correct choice of the auxiliary space will be the main ingredient in the construction of the rgt , whereas the definition of the maps @xmath69 and @xmath70 turns out to be rather straight forward .",
