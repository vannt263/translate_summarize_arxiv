    "discrete time quantum walks are the counterpart of the classical random walks when the coin used to direct the walker steps can assume a superposition of its possible states @xcite .",
    "this ability to exist in a superposition leads to a highly entangled joint state for the coin and walker over time @xcite , resulting in a clear speedup .",

    "a natural system where the quantum walk on a circle can be implemented though is on the emerging field of quantum optomechanics , where quantum mechanical modes can be coupled to quantum light modes @xcite .",
    "given the degree of control achieved and the ability to reach an enormous variety of strong coupling in those systems @xcite , a particular advantage over the previous experimental realizations would be the possibility to implement a quantum walk on a large number of time steps .",
    "it is therefore expected that they might be employed in the near future for implementation of a quantum walk , be it on the optical or the microwave regime .",
    "here we propose an implementation of a quantum walk on a circle in an optomechanical ( or electromechanical ) system .",
    "the proposed system is an optomechanical resonator , which is composed of an optical cavity coupled to a mechanical resonator as presented in fig .",

    "the coupling considered induces a frequency shift on the optical field conditioned on the displacement of the mechanical resonator .",

    "<S> we propose an implementation of a quantum walk on a circle on an optomechanical system by encoding the walker on the phase space of a radiation field and the coin on a two - level state of a mechanical resonator . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the system is obtained by applying suzuki - trotter decomposition . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically show that the system displays typical behaviors of quantum walks , namely , the probability distribution evolves ballistically and the standard deviation of the phase distribution is linearly proportional to the number of steps . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze the effects of decoherence by using the phase damping channel on the coin space , showing the possibility to implement the quantum walk with present day technology . </S>"
