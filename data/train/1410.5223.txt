    "the map - coloring game was conceived by steven brams and first published in 1981 by martin gardner in _ scientific american _ @xcite .",
    "however , the game was not well investigated in the mathematics community until bodlaender reinvented it in 1991 @xcite within the contexts of graphs .",
    "while the game has now been examined extensively @xcite , and gone through numerous generalizations and variations @xcite , we now present the standard version of the original vertex coloring game .",
    "the _ t - coloring game _ is played between alice and bob on a finite graph @xmath0 with a set @xmath1 of @xmath2 colors . in the game , a color @xmath3 is _ legal _ for a vertex @xmath4 if @xmath4 does not have a neighbor colored with @xmath5 .",
    "play begins with alice coloring an uncolored vertex with a legal color , and progresses with alice and bob alternating turns coloring uncolored vertices with legal colors from @xmath1 .",
    "if at any point there is an uncolored vertex that does not have a legal color available , bob wins .",
    "otherwise , alice will win once every vertex becomes colored .",
    "the _ game chromatic number _ of a graph @xmath0 , denoted @xmath6 , is the least @xmath2 such that alice has a winning strategy when the @xmath2-coloring game is played on @xmath0 .",
    "clearly @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the maximum degree in @xmath0 .    in @xcite , bodlaender provided an example of a tree with game chromatic number 4 and proved that every tree has game chromatic number of at most 5 .",
    "faigle et al .",
    "@xcite were able to improve this bound .",
    "they proved the stronger result that any forest has _ game coloring number _ of at most 4 ; that is to say if the coloring game is played with an unlimited set of colors , alice can guarantee each vertex becomes colored before 4 of its neighbors are colored .",
    "thus , if the coloring game is played on any forest , alice can play in a way such that every uncolored vertex has at most 3 colored neighbors , thereby guaranteeing every uncolored vertex has an available color if 4 colors are used .",
    "no previous literature has investigated the distinction between forests with different game chromatic numbers , which is the topic of this paper .    in the first two sections , we highlight the basic strategies used by alice and bob throughout the paper . in section 4 ,",
    "we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a forest to have game chromatic number 2 .",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions are trivial for forests with game chromatic number 0 and 1 , so the remaining part of the paper investigates the differences between forests with game chromatic number 3 and 4 . in the 5th section , we present a minimal example of a forest with game chromatic number 4 .",
    "sections 6 and 7 provide criteria to determine the game chromatic number of a forest without vertices of degree 3 .",
