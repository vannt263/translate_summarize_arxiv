    "weak lensing by large scale structures has been recognized for a decade as a potentially powerful tool to probe the distribution of dark matter in the universe , as well as a way to measure the cosmological parameters ( @xcite ) .",
    "reports of sound detections of such an effect have been done recently by different groups ( @xcite ) from independent data sets and data analysis procedures .",
    "these first measurements are detections of the excess variance of galaxy ellipticities with respect to a random orientation of the intrinsic ellipticities , and are in very good agreement with theoretical expectations based on cluster normalized models of structure formation .",
    "these detections demonstrate that the systematic errors can be controlled down to a low enough level ; this is a remarkable achievement that paves the way to genuine reconstruction of projected mass maps of the universe .",
    "the aim of projected mass maps is not only to measure the projected mass power spectrum .",
    "it has indeed been stressed that valuable constraints on cosmological parameters are expected to come from a joint measurement of variance and higher order moments such as the skewness of the convergence ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is because the variance is strongly dependent on both the amplitude of the mass power spectrum and the density of the universe , while the skewness ( properly normalized ) is essentially a measure of the latter .",
    "another motivation for measuring the skewness of the convergence comes from recent works on the possible existence of intrinsic correlations in the galaxy ellipticities ( @xcite ) .",
    "this might indeed challenge the cosmological interpretation of weak lensing surveys if part of the signal is due to intrinsic alignment of galaxies .",
    "however , additional information on the statistics of the signal such as the skewness can provide a way to confirm the nature of it ( e.g. a signal dominated by intrinsic ellipticity alignments may not lead to a measurable skewness as pointed out in @xcite ) .",
    "current skewness predictions rely mostly on perturbative analysis of structure growth which is expected to break down at scales ( around a few arcmins ) where the lensing signal is easier to measure .",
    "it is therefore desirable to dispose also of intermediate and small scale predictions for the higher order moments . for the second moment ,",
    "the variance , the nonlinear evolution of the power spectrum have been used since the early calculations ( @xcite ) .",
    "these calculations are based on a fitting formula for the non - linear evolution of the mass power spectrum ( @xcite ) accurate to @xmath3 , depending on the cosmological model . @xcite and @xcite used this phenomenological approach to compute the non - linear convergence power spectrum , the small - scale shear variance and its correlation functions .",
    "the results are in remarkably good agreement with ray - tracing simulations ( @xcite )",
    ". unfortunately the non - linear evolution of higher order statistics can not be simply described by the non - linear power spectrum alone because a description of the non - linear evolution of mode coupling is also required .",
    "for instance , the non - linear evolution of the skewness directly depends on how the bispectrum evolves .",
    "prescriptions for the non - linear evolution of the bispectrum were not available until very recently .",
    "such an issue is obviously closely related to the understanding of the non - linear gravitational dynamics that has been extensively studied for the last 10 years .",
    "although these efforts were primarily done for studying the galaxy clustering properties one can take advantage of the results that have emerged in this domain .",
    "recently , hui ( 1999 ) extended the skewness calculations in the strongly non - linear regime using `` hyperextended perturbation theory '' ( hereafter hept , @xcite ) .",
    "the predictions agree well with ray tracing simulations ( @xcite ) at very small scales ( @xmath4 ) , but overestimate the simulation values at larger scales .",
    "this is expected since hept was proposed to work in the non - linear regime , where the hierarchical clustering ansatz is assumed to hold .",
    "extensions of this approach presented in the literature ( @xcite and @xcite ) are also based on the hierarchical ansatz , and thus suffer from the same limitations .",
    "recently , scoccimarro & couchman ( 2000 ) obtained a fitting formula for the bispectrum based on numerical simulations of cdm models . in this paper , we use this result to compute the skewness of the convergence @xmath0 and compare it to ray - tracing simulations .",
    "this allows to bridge the gap between previous results restricted to either the non - linear regime or the weakly non - linear regime where perturbation theory holds . a different approach to this problem , using press - schechter halos ,",
    "is given by cooray & hu ( 2000 ) .",
    "taking advantage of these investigations , we also address the importance of the lens - lens coupling effects and of the born approximation , which are routinely used in weak lensing calculations .",
    "it is usually assumed ( see @xcite ) in semi - analytical predictions that the coupling between lens planes is negligible , as well as the successive deflections of the lensed light ray .",
    "this is equivalent to assume that the universe can be approximated by a single lens plane at some _ fiducial _ redshift .",
    "there is _ a priori _ no reason to believe that these approximations are still valid in the non - linear regime .",
    "here we test quantitatively these approximations down to very small scales both using our ray - tracing simulations and semianalytic predictions .",
    "the questions we address in this paper are therefore the following : does the non - linear prediction of the skewness @xmath5 based on the non - linear evolution of the bispectrum describe correctly intermediate scales ? is the skewness of the convergence still an efficient way of discriminating between different cosmologies ?",
    "are the corrections to the unperturbed ray - path given by the born approximation and lens - lens coupling terms still negligible at non - linear scales ?",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "basic definitions , perturbative expressions and the description of the non - linear bispectrum are reviewed in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we give the relevant equations to calculate the variance and the skewness of the convergence , including correction terms due to lens - lens couplings and deviations from the born approximation .",
    "section 4 describes the ray - tracing simulations .",
    "we present our results in section 5 and conclusions in section 6 .",
    "we assume the standard model of structure growth from initial gaussian fluctuations .",
    "perturbation theory ( @xcite ) which describes the evolution of the density contrast @xmath6 is well known , therefore we shall quote here only the results and notations needed in this paper .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath7 of the density contrast is defined as    @xmath8    if @xmath9 ( perturbative regime ) , for an einstein - de sitter universe ( @xmath10 ) , the solution of the equation of motion of @xmath11 can be written as the following perturbation expansion    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the scale factor such that @xmath14 today .",

    "the non - linear prediction of the skewness requires two ingredients : the non - linear evolution of the power spectrum and bispectrum . to describe the non - linear power spectrum",
    ", we use the fitting formula of ( @xcite ) , based on early work by ( @xcite ) , and obtained by fitting the non - linear power spectrum in numerical simulations .    in order to describe the bispectrum at all scales",
    ", we use the fitting formula derived by scoccimarro & couchman ( 2000 ) for the non - linear evolution of the bispectrum in numerical simulations of cdm models , extending previous work for scale - free initial conditions ( @xcite ) .",

    "calculations of gravitational lensing statistics using perturbation theory have been presented in detail in the literature ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",

    "the amplification matrix @xmath56 describes the mapping between the source plane at @xmath43    @xmath57    which using the first order expansion of eq.([propeq ] ) becomes @xmath58 with    @xmath59    the convergence @xmath0 and the shear @xmath60 are defined such that the amplification matrix takes the symmetric form    @xmath61    @xmath0 and @xmath60 are therefore line - of - sight integrals from the source distance @xmath43 to @xmath62 .",

    "the second is that we neglect non - linear terms in the amplification matrix ( which is physically equivalent to neglecting all the couplings between subsequent lenses ) .",
    "these two approximations ignore quadratic terms of the form @xmath75 , @xmath76 or @xmath77 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there is no reason a priori to neglect these terms in the skewness calculation , because they give a contribution of the same order as eq.([kappa3 ] ) .",
    "we shall address this question in the next section .",
    "the effect of dropping the lens - lens coupling and the born approximation has been calculated in the weakly non - linear regime ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the contribution to the skewness can be calculated by considering the perturbation expansion up to the second order in the gravitational potential in eq.([adef ] ) , which leads to a second order correction term @xmath78 in eq.([aapprox ] ) .",
    "after lengthy but straightforward calculations , the correction to the third moment @xmath79 can be derived :    @xmath80 . \\label{kappa3corr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the similarity with eq.([kappa3 ] ) is quite obvious , which shows that the two terms ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) are of the same order @xmath83 in the perturbative sense .",
    "the only difference between the two expressions lies in the double time integral here .",
    "it was shown ( @xcite and @xcite ) that this double integral makes the correction term eq.([kappa3corr ] ) only a few percent of eq.([kappa3 ] ) .",
    "in other words , even though the two expressions have indeed the same order @xmath84 , they differ by almost one order of magnitude just because of the additional @xmath85 factor in eq.([kappa3corr ] ) ( in the case of a single source redshift this factor is equivalent to an additional @xmath86 factor , according to eq.([gdef ] ) ) .",
    "it is therefore correct to say that the lensing efficiency function @xmath86 can play the role of a perturbative parameter as the density contrast does ( when @xmath87 ) .",
    "the smallness of @xmath88 shows that even in the weakly non - linear regime , terms involving powers of @xmath86 higher than @xmath89 will always be small compared to terms only proportional to @xmath86 . in the following",
    "we shall compute eq.([kappa3corr ] ) in the non - linear regime , and use results from ray - tracing simulations in order to check if this statement is still valid when the density contrast is much larger than @xmath89 .",
    "we can now calculate the variance , the skewness and its correction of the convergence field using the eq.([kappa2 ] ) , ( [ kappa3 ] ) and ( [ kappa3corr ] ) by forming the ratios :    @xmath90    it is worth to notice that @xmath91 is weakly dependent on the cosmological parameters since the @xmath41 dependence in the front of eq.([kappa2 ] ) and eq.([kappa3corr ] ) cancels out .",
    "the non - linear variance is given by eq.([kappa2 ] ) where the power spectrum is replaced by the peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) prescription as in jain & seljak ( 1997 ) .",
    "the non - linear third moment is given by eq.([kappa3 ] ) where @xmath24 has been replaced by @xmath92 and we use the non - linear power spectrum . for the skewness correction , we only need to use the non - linear power spectrum in eq.([kappa3corr ] ) .",
    "we use two types of filtering schemes : top - hat filtering and @xmath93 statistics .",
    "the fourier transform of the top - hat window is :    @xmath94    where @xmath95 denotes a bessel function .",
    "the @xmath96 statistic can be defined either from the convergence @xmath0 or from the tangential shear @xmath97 :    @xmath98    where @xmath99 , and @xmath100 is the compensated filter .",

    "the motivation for using the compensated filters is illustrated on fig.2 of schneider et al .",
    "( 1998 ) : this filter is a pass - band filter , which is a more direct estimate of the mass band powers than the top - hat filter .",
    "another advantage of the compensated filter is that the measurement of the skewness does not require a mass reconstruction ( whereas top - hat filtered statistic does ) as it can be evaluated directly from the shear ( eq.([mapdef ] ) ) .",
    "note also that the compensated filter defined above peaks at a scale @xmath104 , if @xmath105 is the radius of the filter .",
    "therefore at equal radius with the top - hat filter , @xmath96 statistics probes scales as small as @xmath104 .",
    "we use two different kind of ray - tracing simulations ( high and low resolution simulations ) which allow us to investigate scales from @xmath4 to several tens of arcmins . the high resolution simulations ( @xmath4 )",
    "were done by jain , seljak & white ( 2000 ) , and are described in that paper .",

    "the likely explanation is that the small discrepancy observed in that case for the top hat filter ( fig .",
    "[ th.ps ] ) is amplified by the compensated filter , which acts like a derivative operator on the convergence field : as a pass - band filter , the compensated filter is more sensitive to any small discrepancy ( in @xmath139-bands ) between the non - linear power - spectrum fitting formula and the ray - tracing simulations , whereas the top - hat filter integrates over large range of @xmath139 s and tends to mask such discrepancies .",
    "we should note that the effects of resolution also cause the variance to decrease at small scales ( top left panels in fig .",

    "surprisingly , even in the non - linear regime , the correction remains small and , in fact , the relative skewness correction is smaller than in the weakly non - linear regime ! as explained in section 3.3",
    ", this means that coupling terms introduce a non - linearity which is always smaller than the non - linearity produced by very dense ( non - linear ) structures .",
    "in other words , even in the non - linear regime , the dominant lensing contribution comes from the single lens - plane approximation , which physically means that the probability for a given line - of - sight to pass through two very dense structures at very different resdhifts is very low .",
    "similar results hold for the @xmath96 statistics ( not shown here ) where , in fact , the correction terms to the skewness are even smaller .",

    "here we compare small scale ( 1 ) non - linear calculations ( left panel ) to larger scale ( 10 ) perturbation theory calculations ( right panel ) for top - hat smoothing .",
    "note that the choice of a scale for the perturbative estimate is almost not relevant since it does depend very weakly on scale ( figure [ th.ps ] ) .",
    "this figure shows that the cosmological dependence is preserved in the non - linear regime , and that @xmath5 remains essentially an estimator of @xmath141 ( the degeneracy along @xmath42 is strong ) .",
    "this result has to be compared with the cosmic microwave background and the supernovae constraints , which are sensitive to the curvature and @xmath142 respectively .",
    "this clearly motivates further lensing studies as an independent means of measuring the cosmological parameters .",
    "in fact the lensing constraints are similar to constraints derived from the galaxy catalogues or the velocity fields , although the physics is much simpler here , and weak lensing does not suffer from the galaxy bias problem .",
    "the skewness predictions in the non - linear regime are twice their value using perturbation theory at large scales .",
    "therefore the cosmic variance and noise analysis done in van waerbeke , bernardeau & mellier ( 1999 ) underestimated the capability of lensing surveys by a significant amount , essentially because they used very low resolution and approximate dynamics in their simulations . in this work",
    "the authors shown that a @xmath143 square degrees survey would measure the skewness at @xmath144 , in standard observational conditions , if @xmath145 ( @xmath146 if @xmath147 ) . here",
    ", the signal amplitude is twice larger , therefore we would need @xmath148 times less sky coverage to reach the same signal - to - noise ratio to measure @xmath5 .",
    "however , the exact gain depends on the precise amount of cosmic variance and shot noise at this scale . since the cosmic variance is already given in figure  [ th.ps ]",
    ", we can simply add the shot noise obtained in van waerbeke , bernardeau & mellier ( 1999 ) to the high resolution simulation results presented here .",
    "it turns out that the shot noise is roughly @xmath149 at @xmath150 arcmin , therefore we can reach the signal - to - noise ( @xmath151 for ocdm ) with only @xmath107 square degrees with a single measurement at @xmath152 .",
    "however we should keep in mind that our results for the error on the skewness in the @xmath42cdm model are consistent although slightly smaller than previous estimates from white & hu ( 2000 ) , possibly due to the fact that our realizations are not completely independent ( being random samples of a single suite of simulations ) .",

    "[ rij_var.eps ] shows the cross - correlation coefficient @xmath153 between the variance measured at angular scale @xmath154 and @xmath155 , for the @xmath42cdm model ( similar results hold for the other cosmological models and for the skewness measurements as well ) .",
    "these results were obtained by averaging over the 40 realizations in our ensemble .",
    "the top panel presents results for the top hat filter , whereas the bottom panel corresponds to the compensated filter .",
    "we show three angular scales , @xmath156 arcmin for the top hat case , and @xmath157 arcmin for the compensated filter .",
    "the top hat measurements of the variance show a large cross - correlation , in fact , the cross - correlation coefficient is almost unity among all scales . on the other hand , as expected from being a band - pass filter , the compensated filter measurements are much less correlated .",
    "note however than this result only includes cosmic variance contributions , i.e. it does not include shot noise , which can be a significant source of cross - correlations at small scales .",
    "we calculated semi - analytically the r.m.s .",
    "and the skewness of the convergence field @xmath0 and showed that the non - linear prescription for the 3-dimensional bispectrum given in scoccimarro & couchman ( 2000 ) describes the transition from perturbative to non - linear angular scales very well with an accuracy @xmath158 .",
    "we combined different ray - tracing simulations with largely different resolutions ( @xmath4 and @xmath159 ) to compare our predictions .",
    "the transition from the weakly non - linear scales to the non - linear regime is clearly visible and also accurately described by our semi - analytical approach for both top - hat and compensated smoothing schemes for the ocdm , scdm and @xmath42cdm models ( the @xmath106cdm predictions are not very accurate for the compensated filter , but we suggest that it might come from innacuracies in the non - linear power spectrum fitting formula ) .",
    "our results extend previous non - linear calculations of the skewness of @xmath0 which either assumed the validity of hept at all redshifts ( @xcite ) or relied on the hierarchical clustering ansatz ( @xcite ) at intermediate scales .",
    "our semi - analytical approach allows us to investigate the cosmological dependence of the skewness of @xmath0 in as many models as desired , without having to perform a ray tracing simulation each time .    by comparing the skewness in ray - tracing simulations with and without lens - lens coupling and born approximation terms",
    ", we demonstrated that the single lens - plane approximation remains valid even in the highly non - linear regime , which is a non - trivial statement about weak lensing at small scales .",
    "we found that the contribution of these terms to the skewness is in remarkable agreement with the semi - analytical predictions .",
    "we have also calculated @xmath5 in the @xmath140 plane and shown that the signal is about twice the expected value from perturbation theory with roughly the same degeneracy in @xmath42 as in the perturbative case , generalizing previous results ( jain et al .",
    "2000 , white & hu 2000 ) .",
    "in addition , our results on the cosmic variance of the skewness suggests that a combined analysis of the existing weak lensing surveys ( @xcite ) should already be able to measure the skewness of the convergence .",
