    "it is expected that a quantum theory of gravity may resolve the black hole ( bh ) singularity problem . however , as a quantum theory of gravity is beyond to reach , a quantum cosmology approach based on a minisuperspace approximation might provide some insight into problems of this nature .",
    "assuming that the ultimate structure of space - time should be determined by quantum gravity and that should be noncommutative ( nc ) , then noncommutativity in a quantum cosmological level should be considered .",
    "in fact , noncommutativity of space - time is shown to be relevant in the context of bhs physics @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting features of this noncommutativity is that it allows for a square integrable wave function , solution of the noncommutative wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) equation .    in this contribution one presents a phase - space non - canonical nc extension of the kantowski - sachs ( ks ) cosmological model @xcite and its application to study the singularity of a schwarzschild bh @xcite . in the interior of a schwarzschild bh , for @xmath0 ,",
    "time and radial coordinates are interchanged ( @xmath1 ) and space - time is described by the metric : [ eq0.2 ] ds^2=-(2mt-1)^-1dt^2+(2mt-1)dr^2+t^2(d^2+^2d^2 )  .",
    "that is , an isotropic metric turns into an anisotropic one , implying that the interior of a schwarzschild bh can be described by an anisotropic cosmological space - time .",
    "thus , the metric ( [ eq0.2 ] ) can be mapped into the ks cosmological model @xcite , which , in the misner parametrization , can be written as [ eq1.4 ] ds^2=-n^2dt^2+e^2dr^2+e^-2(+)(d^2+^2d^2 )  , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are scale factors , and @xmath4 is the lapse function . the following identification for @xmath5 , [ eq0.3 ]",
    "n^2=(2mt-1)^-1 , e^2 = ( 2mt-1 ) , e^-2e^-2=t^2  , allows for mapping the metric eq .",
    "( [ eq1.4 ] ) into the metric eq .",
    "( [ eq0.2 ] ) .",
    "one considers that the two scale factors @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and the corresponding canonical conjugated momenta @xmath6 and @xmath7 do not commute , and [ eq1.5 ] & = & i ( 1 + + ^2 _ ) + & = & i ( + ( 1 + ) ^2 + ( 1 + ) _ ) + & = & = i ( 1 + ( 1 + ) + ^2 _ ) , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are positive constants and @xmath11 , a quite physical condition @xcite . the noncommutative wdw ( ncwdw ) equation of the ks cosmological model obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite is considered to describe the interior of the bh .",
    "the remaining commutation relations vanish . for @xmath12",
    "it implies that the noncommutative commutation and uncertainty relations are themselves position and momentum dependent .",
    "the case @xmath13 corresponds to the canonical phase - space noncommutativity @xcite .",
    "one can relate this nc algebra with the heisenberg - weyl algebra , via a suitable map .",
    "suppose that @xmath14 obey the hw algebra , @xmath15 = \\left[\\hat{\\beta}_c , \\hat{p}_{\\beta_c } \\right ] = i$ ]",
    ". then a suitable transformation would be : [ eq1.7 ] & = & _ c - 2 _ _ c + e _",

    "= _ _ c - 2 _ c + f _ c^2 . here , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are real parameters such that @xmath18 , and one chooses the positive solution given the invariance of the physics on the d map @xcite , and [ eq1.9 ] e = - f , f = - ( 1 + )  .",
    "of course , the inverse transformation can be obtained @xcite .    as in the canonical nc ks cosmological model @xcite",
    ", one obtains the ncwdw equation considering the canonical quantization of the ks hamiltonian , the operator @xmath19 that commutes with the hamiltonian and the d map eqs .",
    "( [ eq1.7 ] ) , @xcite [ eq1.19 ] & & ^2 r- 48 ( - 2 _ c - 2 e _ c^2 +",
    "a ) r- 2 ( _ c+f_c^3)r + + & & + f^2 _ c^4r + a^2r + ( ^2 ^ 2 + 2 a f ) _ c^2r=0  .",
    "the dependence on @xmath20 has completely disappeared and one is left with an ordinary differential equation for @xmath21 . through the substitution , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 one obtains a second order linear differential equation , a schrdinger - like equation : [ eq1.21 ] - _ a  ( z ) + v(z ) _ a ( z)= 0  , where the potential function , v(z ) , reads : [ eq1.22 ] v(z ) = - ( z -a ) ^2 - f^2 ^4 z^4 - 2 f ^2(z - a ) z^2 + 48 ( -2 z -2 ^2 e z^2 + a ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq1.21 ] ) depends explicitly on the noncommutative parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the eigenvalue @xmath25 .",
    "notice that @xmath26 .    in this contribution one analyzes the singularity @xmath27 in the schwarzschild bh with this ncwdw equation , eqs .",
    "( [ eq1.21 ] ) and ( [ eq1.22 ] ) .",
    "in fact , with the asymptotic solutions of this ncwdw equation one is able to study the singularity of the bh . in the canonical nc approach ,",
    "these type of solutions vanish in the neighbourhood of @xmath27 , but the probability of finding the system at the singularity diverges @xcite .",
    "however , using the non - canonical noncommutativity , one actually can remove the singularity of the schwarzschild bh @xcite .",
    "to study the singularity of the bh , one needs to examine the asymptotic limit of the ncwdw . from eq .",
    "( [ eq1.22 ] ) one finds that asymptotically @xmath28 the potential function is dominated by the term [ eq1.24 ] v(z ) ~- f^2 ^4 z^4 , which leads to @xmath29 solutions of the schrdinger equation ( [ eq1.21 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the hamiltonian @xmath30 has a continuous and real spectrum @xcite in @xmath31 .",
    "the asymptotic form of the eigenfunction corresponding to the eigenvalue zero and eigenvalue @xmath25 of @xmath32 is [ eq1.25 ] _ a ( z ) ~1z  .",
    "thus , one can write a general solution of the ncwdw equation as [ eq1.26 ] ( _ c , _ c ) = c(a ) _ a ( _ c , _ c ) da  , where @xmath33 are arbitrary complex constants and @xmath34 is of the form : [ eq1.27 ] _ a ( _ c , _ c ) = b _ a ( )  . here",
    "@xmath35 is a the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq1.21 ] ) and @xmath36 is a normalization constant such that : [ eq1.27a ] |_a ( _ c , _ c ) |^2 d_c = b^2 |_a ( ) |^2 d _",
    "c=1 one fixes a constant @xmath20-hypersurface , given that the wave function is oscillatory in @xmath20 .",
    "thus , it is natural to consider a measure @xmath37 in order to define the inner product in @xmath38 and the computation of probabilities . for the wave function",
    "( [ eq1.26 ] ) one then finds : [ eq1.27b ] ||||_l^2(^2,d)=((_c , ) ^ * ( _ c , ) d)^1/2 = ( c(a)c^*(a ) ( _ a ( _ c , _ c ) _ a^ * ( _ c , _ c ) d_c ) da da ) ^1/2 .",
    "the wave functions @xmath39 are solutions of a hyperbolic - type equation , and in general , they are not orthogonal to each other .",
    "so , one uses the cauchy - schwartz inequality to compute the @xmath40-inner product between @xmath34 and @xmath41 .",
    "it follows that : [ eq1.27c ] ||||_l^2(^2,d ) |c(a)| ||_a ( _ c , _ c ) ||_l^2(^2,d ) da = |c(a)| da where , in the last step , the relation ( [ eq1.27a ] ) was used .",
    "thus , one finally concludes that for @xmath42 the wave function eq .",
    "( [ eq1.26 ] ) is squared integrable on constant @xmath20-hypersurfaces and the bh probability @xmath43 at the singularity can now be calculated : [ eq1.28 ] p(r=0,t=0)= _ _ c ,",
    "_ c + _ _ c^+ _ -^+ | ( _ c , ) |^2 d=__c , _ c + _ _",
    "c^+    fact that @xmath44 .",
    "consequently , the integral in @xmath45 vanishes , independently of the value of @xmath20 .",
    "in this contribution , a non - canonical phase - space nc extension of the ks cosmological model is used to study the singularity of a schwarzschild bh . in contrast with",
    "the canonical nc studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , this type of noncommutativity allows us to obtain square integrable solutions for the asymptotic ncwdw equation .",
    "in fact , this is the major property of the model .",
    "that is , the general solution of our ncwdw equation is square integrable on the constant @xmath20-hypersurfaces , and so one can use the same rules as in quantum mechanics to evaluate probabilities . in this case , one computes the probability of finding the bh at the singularity which is found to vanish .",
