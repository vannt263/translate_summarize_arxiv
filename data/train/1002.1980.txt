    "recent single - molecule fluorescence imaging methods circumvent the rayleigh criterion and measure subdiffraction molecular separations with nanometer precision .",
    "however , such precision is not achieved without tradeoffs .",
    "some methods bleach the fluorophores ",

    "in addition , these methods are based on centroid location measurements of each constituent molecule ; therefore , the rate of separation measurements is bound by the total time required to locate all constituent molecules  typically in seconds .",
    "the timescale of seconds is long for many biological processes where molecular separations change faster than seconds .",
    "although the shrec method allows simultaneous dimolecular separation measurements in the timescale of milliseconds , labeling heterogeneous fluorophores and overlapping two spectral distinct emission images pose additional challenges .    here",
    "we report an alternative method to measure subdiffraction separations of two molecules labeled with identical fluorophores , all by using a single image of the two constituent molecules . for simplicity ,",
    "in the rest of this article we call the two separated fluorophores a dimer .",
    "the dimers were simultaneously illuminated for milliseconds by standard laser excitation ( intensity of order 1 kw/@xmath5 ) and the emitted photons were collected by a standard single - molecule fluorescent imaging setup . the collective intensity profile of the subdiffraction separated dimers were recorded and fit to a gaussian function . while the point spread function ( psf ) centroids of the two constituent molecules can not be resolved , the spread of the dimer intensity profile , measured as standard deviation ( sd ) of the dimer s gaussian - approximated intensity profile ( in this article we call the dimer intensity profile dimer psf ) , increases with dimer separation . in our method , the longitudinal sd ( along the dimer direction ) and the total detected photon count of the dimer image are the principle parameters needed for ( 1 ) differentiating dimers from monomers and ( 2 ) determining the separation of the dimer with known precision .",
    "we have compared the experimental results with simulations and they agree well .",
    "the reported sd study here analyzes a convolved image of two molecules and extracts the molecular separation information ; the method is analogous to deconvolving a complex single - molecule image for molecular properties .",
    "we call this method of using the spread of convolved single - molecule images to analyze molecular properties  single - molecule image deconvolution , \" or smid . using smid ,",
    "dimer separations can be measured by using a single image of milliseconds exposure times , allowing improvement in temporal resolution from seconds to milliseconds .",
    "the improvement is 10- to 1000-fold depending on the number of photons emitted by the dimer and the dimer separation .",
    "this improved temporal resolution is attributed to the single - image nature of the smid dimer separation measurements ; here we name single - molecule studies that use single images of millisecond exposure times the  single - image molecular analysis \" method , or sima .",
    "this article applies smid and sima to a simple convolution example of two molecules , future smid and sima analysis can be extended to higher order multimers of different geometrical arrangements .",
    "when two identical fluorophores are separated by less than the diffraction limit , the width of the dimer psf varies with the dimer separation .",
    "figure  [ fig1](a ) shows an array of streptavidin - cy3 dimers with increasing horizontal subdiffraciton separations , @xmath6 , of 0 , 79 , 158 , and 237 nm .",
    "the dimer images were constructed from two images of an experimental monomer movie : one of the two monomer images was displaced by 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 pixels ( 79 nm / pixel ) horizontally , then the images were added .",
    "the number of detected photons , @xmath7 , of each monomer image was 511 photons . from the figures ,",
    "it is clear that the width of the dimer images changes with separation . at the 79 nm separation ,",
    "the dimer is not clearly different from the constructed monomer ( dimer at 0 nm separation ) ; at the 158 nm separation , the image becomes wider and it resembles a dimer more than a monomer ; at the 237 nm separation , which is approximately equal to the diffraction limit of 230 nm , the image is clearly different from a monomer and the two monomer psf peaks may start to be resolved .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) the dimer s increasing width with separation is quantified .",
    "the dimer psfs is unimodal as the sum of two gaussian functions @xcite and fits well to a 1d gaussian , where all transverse pixel intensity values at each longitudinal pixel were averaged .",
    "the 1d @xmath8-axis sd values of the dimer increase with separation as 114.1 , 119.7 , 141.6 , and 178.6 nm , respectively .",

    ", one must first determine whether an image is a monomer or a dimer .",
    "here we show that by using the psf sd and photon count of a single image , dimers can be differentiated from monomers .    for a monomer and a subdiffraction - separated dimer of the same photon count ,",
    "the image is a dimer if the dimer psf sd ( @xmath9 ) exceeds the monomer psf sd ( @xmath10 ) by more than the sum of the dimer and monomer sd measurement errors , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , as @xmath13 here the sd of a sd distribution , @xmath14 or @xmath15 , is the error associated with a sd measurement of a single image .",
    "figure [ fig2](a ) compares the experimental and simulation sd distributions of a constructed monomer ( 0 nm separated dimer ) and a 158 nm separated dimer .",
    "the two experimental distributions were constructed from one monomer movie , which has 236 valid images with photon count of 1,100 @xmath16 124 ( mean @xmath16 sd ) .",
    "after construction , the mean dimer movie photon count was 2,200 , and the number of images was 118 .",
    "the simulations used the experimental monomer @xmath7 and @xmath10 distributions and the experimental 0 nm separation dimer background photon distributions .",

    "[ fig2](a ) , we can conclude that for an image with a photon count above 2200 and @xmath9 above @xmath18 106.7 nm + 3.8 nm + 4.8 nm = 115.3 nm ( the simulation results ) , it is a dimer .",
    "our 158 nm separated dimer has a mean @xmath9 of 139.5 nm @xmath19 115.3 nm , therefore the 158 nm separation images are dimers .",

    "this is because that although the dimer sd error is approximately independent of the separation , the @xmath9 vs. @xmath6 line flattens out at small separations , identical sd error translates into larger separation measurement error at low separations . as a result , the @xmath23 line decreases with @xmath6 .",

    "the main limitations are that ( i ) the minimum measurable dimer separation only reaches 40 nm for a reasonable 200 ms exposure time . more photons are needed to measure smaller separations ; although , with increasing exposure time the temporal resolution will be compromised ; ( ii ) typical experimental 100 to 2000 photon counts per dimer image restricts the most useful range of measurable dimer separations to be between 70 nm , the typical pixel size , and 250 nm , the rayleigh criteria .      in measuring subdiffraction dimer separations using the centroid method ( shrimp , shrec , palm , and nalns ) ,",
