    "high - redshift molecular absorption provides an important means to understand the physical conditions in the molecular interstellar medium in a galaxy at a cosmologically significant redshift .",
    "of particular interest is an accurate measurement of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation ( ) , one of the fundamental cosmological parameters , and its variation with redshift ( @xcite ) .",
    "the standard cosmological model predicts , for an adiabatic expansion of the universe , @xmath17 , where @xmath18  k @xcite .",
    "this important relation predicted by the theory needs to be confirmed by direct observations .",
    "this can be achieved by measuring the excitation temperature ( ) of interstellar atomic or molecular species at high redshift , in particular the rotational excitation temperature ( ) of molecular transitions . in diffuse",
    "interstellar gas , where collisional excitation is negligible , rotational transitions can be in radiative equilibrium with the cmb ( @xmath19 )",

    "a few years later , @xcite observed a larger sample of molecular transition lines , resulting in several measurements of  below the predicted value .",
    "subsequently , @xcite performed similar observations with the 100-m effelsberg radio telescope , deriving the covering factor and optical depth from advanced models fitted to the data .",

    "we observed the redshifted  and  absorption lines at 14.5  ghz and 24.1  ghz , respectively , toward  using the national radio astronomy observatory s very long baseline array ( vlba ) combined with the phased very large array ( vla ) as a vlba antenna on 1999 january 29 ( program bc087b ) .",
    "we employed two frequency bands of 8 mhz bandwidth each , in both right- and left - circular polarizations .",
    "the center frequencies of the two bands were set to cover both velocities of the ne and sw components ( with @xmath21  difference ; @xcite ) : respectively , 14.46272  ghz and 14.47419  ghz for the  transition and 24.10444  ghz and 24.12356  ghz for the  transition .",
    "we used seven observing blocks of 1 hour duration each .",
    "subsequent observing blocks were undertaken at alternating frequencies of 14.5  ghz and 24.1  ghz ( in total , four observing blocks at 14.5  ghz and three at 24.1  ghz ) .",
    "each 1 hour block consisted of five repetitions of 12-minute groups , each consisting of a 3-minute scan toward the quasar  as passband calibrator and a 9-minute scan toward the target source .",
    "the data correlation was performed at the vlba correlation facility in socorro , nm . the data from each antenna pair were cross - correlated with an integration time of 2  seconds .",
    "each 8 mhz band was split into 128 spectral channels , yielding a channel separation of 62.5 khz . the corresponding velocity resolutions ( with the relativistic doppler effect )",
    "are 0.887  and 0.532   for the  and  transitions , respectively , for rest frequencies of 27294.289 mhz and 45490.3138 mhz @xcite .",
    "the data correlation process was repeated , adopting two different positions for the correlation center of , the positions of the sw and ne images . in j2000",
    "coordinates , the pointing position for the observation was @xmath22 , and the adopted correlation positions were @xmath23 for the sw position and @xmath24 for the ne position .",
    "the correlated data were calibrated using the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ; @xcite ) .",
    "we did not detect absorption toward the ne component .",
    "therefore , we analyzed only the data set with the correlation center at the sw component position and only the 8mhz bands that covered the absorption spectrum in each of the 14.5  ghz and 24.1  ghz bands .",
    "we first corrected the interferometer delays and phases for the effects of diurnal feed rotation ( parallactic angle ) .",
    "we also removed the off - source vla station data by flagging the first minute of each scan .",
    "the amplitudes of the interferometric data were corrected for the small biases ( @xmath25 a few percent ) of the data sampling thresholds among different stations , and then converted from correlation coefficients to flux density units using the system temperature and antenna gain curve information .",
    "we removed instrumental delay and phase offsets by fitting fringe patterns to the data of the calibrator  and corrected the data for these offsets .",
    "bandpass amplitude and phase corrections were also determined from  and applied to .",
    "we then performed phase calibration by fitting fringe patterns to the data of on time scales of 20 seconds , using a model based on the image of from a trial fringe fit .",
    "a continuum spectral baseline for was fitted based on channels 10 to 25 and 105 to 120 and subtracted from the visibility data , yielding a continuum - only data set and a baseline - subtracted `` line '' data set .",
    "the phase of the continuum data set was further calibrated using an iterative self - calibration process . during the self - calibration process",
    ", we simultaneously cleaned the sw and ne continuum components .",
    "the ne component had a positional offset of @xmath26 relative to the sw component and was still in the field of view of the data correlated at the sw position .",
    "the interferometer gain corrections from self - calibration were then applied to the baseline - subtracted `` line '' data set of .    before the spectrum fitting , we converted the frequency @xmath27 of the observed spectra into the velocity units @xmath28 by using the relativistic doppler effect , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the speed of light and @xmath31 the rest frequency of the transition .",
    "we subtracted the expected velocity of 168198.25 for the redshift of @xmath4 , which defines the zero velocity of the obtained spectra .      from the measured absorption amplitude @xmath32 ( defined to be negative for absorption ) and continuum levels @xmath33 of the two transitions ,  and , the optical depth @xmath34 of each transition    is determined by    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the covering factor of the background continuum source by the absorbing cloud ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "if we assume the two transitions are caused by the same absorbing cloud , we can use    these values in the following equation to determine the rotational temperature @xmath38 of the absorbing gas : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the energy difference between the @xmath41 and @xmath42 levels , @xmath43 the boltzmann s constant ( @xmath44  k ; @xcite ) , @xmath45 the statistical weight of the rotational level @xmath46 , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the rest frequency and optical depth ( at the line center velocity @xmath49 ) , respectively , of the rotational absorption @xmath50 .",
    "we assume equal excitation temperature @xmath51 for the two transitions  and ( local thermodynamical equilibrium ) and also assume @xmath52 since collisional excitation is negligible for the diffuse interstellar gas .",
    "we solved equation [ eqn : trot ] for  numerically through iteration .",
    "the equations used to derive equation [ eqn : trot ] are documented in the appendix .",
    "we first imaged the continuum and line absorption with low spatial resolution in order to simulate the results from previous studies .",
    "we made image cubes at both 14.5  ghz and 24.1  ghz with a circular restoring beam of 26 mas ( fwhm ) ; at this resolution , the continuum emission is essentially unresolved .",
    "figure  [ fig : lowres ] displays these low resolution images ; the absorption distributions were obtained by plotting absorption depth , @xmath53 , at each pixel of the image .",
    "we performed gaussian fits to the observed spectra of the baseline - subtracted `` line '' image cubes and measured the absorption amplitudes of the  and  transitions at each pixel of the image .",
    "we first solved for the three parameters , the amplitude , @xmath54 , the line width ( fwhm ) , @xmath55 , and the central line velocity , @xmath49 , of the absorption at the peak pixel of both continuum and absorption at the center of the map .",
    "we measured @xmath56   and @xmath57   for the  line and @xmath58   and @xmath59   for the  line .",
    "averaging the results of the two frequency bands , we obtained the mean line velocity , @xmath60  , and the mean line width , @xmath61  .",
    "we then repeated fitting at each pixel of the image with the line width and velocity fixed at the mean values , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , solving for the absorption amplitude , @xmath54 , only .",
    "table  [ tab : lowres ] lists the measured values at the continuum peak pixel ( in the map center ) at each frequency , and the  measurement assuming identical covering factors , @xmath36 , for the two transitions .",
    "if we assume @xmath64 , we measure @xmath1  k , and varying @xmath36 gives similar results .",
    "this result is consistent with the predicted value of @xmath65  k and with previous measurements by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath66  k ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath67  k ) , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in section [ sect : tint ] , if the absorption does not completely cover the continuum source , insufficient spatial resolution can yield biased rotational temperatures .",
    "next , we made images with the higher angular resolution afforded by our long interferometer baselines . from the line data",
    ", we made an image cube in each frequency channel with @xmath68 pixels of 0.05 mas ( for a field of view of 6.4 mas @xmath69 6.4 mas ) .",
    "we adopted identical circular restoring beams of 0.65 mas width ( fwhm ) for the 14.5  ghz and 24.1  ghz bands .",
    "( the dirty beam size was 1.45 mas @xmath69 0.46 mas with a position angle of @xmath70 at 14.5  ghz and 1.27 mas @xmath69 0.31 mas with a position angle of @xmath71 at 24.1 ghz . )",
    "the line data were self - calibrated with the continuum at each frequency , and therefore the line and continuum maps are accurately aligned with a precision that is only limited by the uncertainty in the baseline calibration and by the thermal noise in the line image ( due to the lower signal - to - noise ratio for absorption ) .",
    "the bandpass phases are calibrated to better than 10 degrees , which translates to a positional accuracy of @xmath72 of the fringe spacing , @xmath73  mas for a @xmath74  mas fringe spacing . the positional uncertainty introduced by the thermal noise in the line image",
    "can be estimated as half of the beam size @xmath75 divided by the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the image . with @xmath76  mas and snr@xmath77 for absorption maps , this results in an accuracy of 0.05  mas .",
    "for this case , relative positions measured in the line and continuum maps are accurate to better than 0.06 mas .    figure [ fig : map ] shows the high resolution maps of the continuum emission of  and the absorption in the foreground gas at @xmath6 .",
    "the continuum maps were obtained by imaging the continuum - only data set .",
    "the absorption distribution in each frequency map was obtained by plotting absorption depth @xmath53 measured at each pixel of the image ( section [ sect : spectfit ] ) .",
    "notably , we find that the absorption peak position in each frequency band , in particular at 14.5  ghz , is offset from the continuum peak position .",
    "the offsets are significantly larger than the uncertainty in the alignment between the line and continuum maps . in the map of the  transition observed at 14.5  ghz ,",
    "the absorption peak lies at a positional offset of @xmath78  mas from the continuum peak , measured through fitting in the deepest absorption channel . for",
    "the  transition observed at 24.1  ghz , the measured offset is @xmath79  mas from the continuum peak to the absorption peak , fitted over the averaged map of the 10 channels ( @xmath80  width ) in which the absorption was most prominent .",
    "the presence of these offsets is a cause for concern that the rotational temperature , , measured with lower angular resolution may be systematically biased ( see section [ sect : tint ] ) .",
    "since the data of  were self - calibrated , the absolute positions of both 14.5  ghz and 24.1  ghz maps are unknown , and hence we need to consider the proper alignment of the two frequency maps before we measure .",
    "were the continuum emission point - like , or were its distribution identical at the two frequencies , self - calibration would correctly align the two maps .",
    "however , the continuum image of  has resolved structure and the relative registration of the maps at the different frequencies can not be _ a priori _ determined . based on vlbi images of other sources ,",
    "it is likely that the continuum emission of  is elongated due to a faint one - sided jet emanating from a self - absorbed core .",
    "owing to optical depths varying with frequency for individual components , one expects a slight positional offset ( along the jet axis ) between the emission peaks at two frequencies .",
    "( note that since absorption depths are small compared to the continuum levels , the brightness peak positions of the continuum maps are not significantly affected by absorption . )",
    "we measured the absorption amplitude at different positions across the images , allowing evaluation of different alignments between the two images .",
    "this was done in the following three steps using least - squares fitting of gaussian profiles to the spectra , in the same manner as for the low resolution images .",
    "firstly , we placed the measurement position for each frequency map at its absorption peak , and solved for the following three parameters : the amplitude @xmath54 the line width ( fwhm ) @xmath55 and the central line velocity @xmath49 of the absorption .",
    "we defined @xmath32 as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the observed spectrum and @xmath33 is the continuum level ( @xmath83 for absorption ) .",
    "we then averaged the results of the two frequency bands to determine the mean line width @xmath62 and the mean velocity @xmath63 .",
    "we obtained @xmath84  and @xmath85   by averaging @xmath86   and @xmath87   for the  line and @xmath88   and @xmath89   for the  line .",
    "secondly , we repeated the fit at the same positions , but fixed the line width and velocity at the mean values , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , solving for the absorption amplitude @xmath54 only .",
    "figure  [ fig : spect ] shows the result of this spectral fit .",
    "the obtained values are @xmath90  mjy / beam for the  line and @xmath91  mjy / beam for the  line . finally , using the same values of @xmath92 and @xmath62 , we measured the absorption amplitude @xmath93 of all individual spectra at each pixel position @xmath94 across the two images .",
    "the measured @xmath93 is plotted as absorption distributions in figure [ fig : map ] .",
    "previous vlbi observations of  at 15 ghz and 43 ghz @xcite show complicated structure of both the sw and the ne images of the radio core with extended jet components on a sub - milliarcsecond scale .",
    "in particular , multi - epoch 43 ghz maps by @xcite have revealed that the core has remarkably complex substructure that changes rapidly with a timescale of weeks .",
    "the complex morphology of the core substructure makes it ambiguous to determine the jet direction .",
    "we therefore determined the jet axis based on our continuum maps to lie along the offset between the absorption and continuum peaks , and we shifted the position of the  measurement along this axis to allow for the possibility of misalignment of the two maps .      for a given alignment of the two images ,  can be measured at any pixel position , provided that both absorption and background continuum emission have sufficient signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "however , since the detected absorption was weak for the  line , we fixed the position for measuring its optical depth , @xmath95 , at its absorption peak position in the 14.5  ghz map , maximizing the signal - to - noise ratio of the measurement .",
    "we shifted the measurement point of @xmath96 along the line shown as a dash - dotted line in figure  [ fig : map ] .",
    "both continuum and absorption levels were measured at a single pixel , and we performed  measurements using three different covering factors ( @xmath97 ) , assumed to be identical for the two transitions .",
    "of course only a very limited range of shifts make physical sense , and we required the continuum emission to reflect realistic synchrotron spectral indices for all pixels with firm detections .",
    "our selection criteria required spectral indices , @xmath98 ( defined by the power - law spectrum @xmath99 ) , which yielded four possible alignments shown by crosses in the 24.1 ghz map in figure  [ fig : map ] .",
    "table  [ tab : hires ] lists the measured values from these measurement points ( as well as from excluded measurement positions with spectral indices outside of @xmath98 ) .",
    "these alignments yield  between 1.1 and 2.5 k , which is significantly lower than the theoretically - predicted value for the cosmic microwave background , @xmath65  k at @xmath0 .",
    "( the three excluded measurement positions in table [ tab : hires ] near the map center , @xmath100 mas , yield spectral indices , @xmath101 , between 2.5 and 2.8 , and  values between 1.1 and 1.6 k. ) we note , as @xcite pointed out , that due to the small rotational constant of , the measured excitation temperature may be susceptible to additional contributions from collisional excitation from ( even moderate densities of ) h@xmath102 gas or local radiative excitation . while this could explain a higher value of  ( as in @xcite )",
    ", it can not explain why our measurement is lower than the radiation temperature .",
    "we discuss the dominant biases in the present result in section [ sect : tint ] . by exploiting  measurements using equation [ eqn : trot ]",
    ", we assume that the physical properties of the gas is the same for the two transitions ( the both absorption lines come from the same absorbing cloud ) .",
    "we will also discuss this assumption in section [ sect : tint ] .",
    "our high - resolution measurement yields  between 1.1 and 2.5  k , which is significantly lower than the expected value of @xmath103  k at @xmath104 . in this section ,",
    "we discuss several possible explanations for this discrepancy .",
    "our vlbi maps of  have revealed that the absorption peak positions of the  and  lines are offset from the continuum peak of the sw core . because these two lines were observed contemporaneously , temporal variations can be excluded , and these offsets indicate that the absorbing cloud of the foreground galaxy is covering the core - jet emission from   only partially , and not entirely .",
    "the synchrotron radiation from the extended components of agns such as jets is optically thin at cm wavelengths , with a spectral index @xmath105 to @xmath106 ( defined as @xmath99 ) , whereas the compact core is generally optically thick and synchrotron self - absorption at low frequencies inverts the spectrum toward @xmath107 ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the core is very compact and unresolved on milliarcsecond scales , our continuum measurements likely include a blend of jet and core emission .",
    "blending _ non - absorbed _ continuum emission with @xmath107 within the beam causes the ratio of the optical depths @xmath108 to decrease from the true value , because the continuum level @xmath109 relative to @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) is increased ( due to @xmath107 ) , while the absorption terms remain unchanged .",
    "this biases the value of  given by equation [ eqn : trot ] to be lower than the true  value as we observe .    in case of our low - resolution measurement ( section  [",
    "sect : lowres ] ) , we are likely more sensitive to extended , low surface brightness emission that could have a significant contribution of jet emission that is also not absorbed , resulting in our measured spectral index of @xmath112 ( table  [ tab : lowres ] ) . the addition of non - absorbed continuum emission from extended components with @xmath113 can falsely increase the measured .",
    "of course , the rough match between the measured and expected  values would then have to be coincidental .       in our  measurements",
    ", we assumed identical physical conditions for the gas giving rise to the two transitions .",
    "our high resolution maps ( figure  [ fig : map ] ) show that the absorption peak of the  line is located more closely to the continuum peak than the  absorption peak ( section  [ sect : imaging ] ) , and also the width of the absorption line in figure  [ fig : spect ] is narrower for the  transition than for the  transition , which could be interpreted as the two absorption lines originating in different gas clouds .",
    "if this were the case , no relation between the optical depths of the two absorption lines could be assumed , and therefore any value for  could have resulted from the measurement . theoretically , it is possible to detect only  absorption from a given cloud where the  line is very weak at low temperature , but when the  line is detected , the  line must also be detected except under highly unusual circumstances .",
    "therefore , it is very unlikely that we see two different absorbing clouds .       the observed difference in offset between continuum and absorption peaks at the two frequencies could also be caused by different apparent positions of the core at the two frequencies , rather than differences in the foreground gas .",
    "the radio core positions of agns are known to shift with frequency due to frequency - dependent optical depths of the jets @xcite .",
    "such a core - shift effect has been observed , for example , recently by @xcite in m87 , but with only 0.1 mas shift between frequencies of 15.4 and 23.8 ghz , comparable to our observing frequencies .",
    "this is well within our resolution , and considering the larger distance to , this effect should be negligible in our data .",
    "our vlbi observations of  sw have identified offsets between the absorption (  and  lines ) and continuum peaks ( all observed contemporaneously ) .",
    "these offsets indicate that absorption in the foreground galaxy covers the core - jet emission from   only partially .",
    "we have shown that insufficient spatial resolution can cause unresolved , non - absorbed continuum emission to contaminate  measurements , and that all previous  measurements could be affected by this bias ( although measurements at millimeter wavelengths may be less affected by this bias because the jet component becomes less pronounced ) .",
    "our high - resolution measurement yields  between 1.1 and 2.5  k , which is significantly lower than the expected value of @xmath103  k from the cosmic microwave background at @xmath0 .",
    "the true rotational temperature of the absorbing gas is likely higher than this measured  value , because of blended - in core - jet components with spectral index @xmath114 , which biases the measurement toward a lower temperature .",
    "our result reinforces the importance of high - resolution observations of to map the absorbing regions in detail , in order to reliably measure the rotational temperature and the cosmic microwave background .",
    "more observations with higher sensitivity to measure absorption depths as well as an absolute - position measurement for correct map alignment will further improve the accuracy of the measurement .",
