    "observations of hawking radiation @xcite in the laboratory @xcite seem to have been vexed with problems .",
    "the very first of such observations @xcite  with intense light pulses in optical media , soon turned out to be inconsistent with theory @xcite .",
    "the observation of stimulated hawking radiation of water waves @xcite was replicated with a nearly identical set  up but better instrumentation , and found to be anomalous scattering with and without a horizon @xcite .",
    "the demonstration of black  hole lasing in bose ",
    "einstein condensates @xcite was recognised as a fluid  mechanical instability @xcite , although the author disputes that @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these attempts of observing hawking radiation in the laboratory have been tremendously fruitful , because their scientific debate has significantly advanced the subject .",
    "one would have learned much less from a perfect experiment right from the beginning .",
    "this paper analysis one of the latest experimental demonstrations of hawking radiation , an article @xcite that claims to have finally and fully verified hawking s calculation @xcite .",
    "however , as carl sagan put it , extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence .",
    "this paper scrutinises the published evidence and the methods of obtaining it . in doing so",
    ", it does not ask whether hawking radiation _ can _ be observed @xcite , but rather whether it _ has _ been observed .",
    "the article @xcite in question reports on an experiment with bose - einstein condensates that are brought into motion by optical forces .",
    "an analogue of the event horizon is formed when the flow of the condensate @xmath0 exceeds the speed of sound @xmath1 .",
    "hawking s theory @xcite applied to this case @xcite predicts that the horizon creates sound quanta , phonons , from the fluctuations of the quantum vacuum . on each side of the horizon , the phonon population @xmath2 is expected @xcite to be equal and planck - distributed @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the circular frequency , @xmath5 planck s constant divided by @xmath6 and @xmath7 boltzmann s constant . the temperature @xmath8 is given @xcite by the relative velocity gradient at the horizon : @xmath9 furthermore , the quantum particles are predicted @xcite to be produced in maximally entangled pairs  one phonon outside the horizon , the other inside . as one of the hawking partners is beyond the horizon , one could never hope to observe this entanglement on astrophysical black holes , but in laboratory analogues one could .    hawking s planckian prediction ( [ planck ] ) is only valid in a regime of weak dispersion , as will be explained in sec .",
    "ii . the experiment @xcite , however , operates at the borderline between weak and strong dispersion , and the observed population distribution is clearly influenced by dispersion . beyond a critical frequency",
    ", no radiation is measured .",
    "yet the article @xcite claims the observation of a planck spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the article @xcite reports on correlations of hawking partners beyond the critical frequency , where there are no particles , which is impossible , as sec .",
    "iii is going to prove , unless the data are statistically irrelevant , as shown in sec .",
    "iv . assumptions and bias in the data analysis are pointed out in sec .",
    "v and conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "in laboratory analogues @xmath1 is dispersive : it depends on frequency or wavenumber @xmath10 .",
    "a horizon is formed where the velocity @xmath0 reaches the group velocity @xmath11 . due to dispersion",
    "the horizon is no longer sharply defined : it depends on wavenumber as well . hawking s planckian prediction ( [ planck ] )",
    "is only valid in a regime of weak dispersion .",
    "sound in bose - einstein condensates at rest obeys the bogoliubov dispersion relation @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the speed of sound for @xmath14 and the length @xmath15 quantifies the dispersion ( @xmath16 is also the healing length of the condensate @xcite ) . in condensates moving with velocity profiles @xmath0",
    ", sound waves experience the bogoliubov dispersion in locally co  moving frames for the doppler  shifted frequency : @xmath17 figure [ stein3 ] shows measurements @xcite of the wavenumbers in different regions of the condensate ( taken from fig .  3 of the article @xcite ) .",
    "one sees that , inside the horizon , there is a maximal frequency @xmath18 for waves propagating against the current .",
    "this is a simple consequence of bogoliubov s relation ( [ bogoliubov ] ) : as the group velocity @xmath11 of sound in the condensate increases with increasing @xmath19 , there is a critical @xmath20 where the group velocity reaches the maximal velocity of the condensate in the experiment . beyond the corresponding critical frequency @xmath18",
    "there is no horizon . for @xmath21",
    "one still gets a planck spectrum of hawking particles if the dispersion is weak , _ i.e. _  if @xmath16 is significantly smaller than the characteristic length scale of the transition region where @xmath0 turns from subsonic to supersonic @xcite . as the hawking temperature ( [ temp ] ) is proportional to the relative velocity gradient at the horizon , most experimental analogues are forced to operate at the borderline between weak and strong dispersion , for maximising the particle yield .",
    "this is not necessarily a problem , but rather an opportunity to explore physics beyond hawking s prediction ( [ planck ] ) .    ]    ]    figure [ stein5 ] shows the particle population versus wavelength inferred from measurements ( taken from fig .",
    "5b of the article @xcite ) .",
    "one clearly sees that beyond a certain wavenumber @xmath22 the population vanishes within the error bars .",
    "according to the dispersion measurements shown in fig .",
    "[ stein3 ] , the value of @xmath22 agrees with the wavenumber outside the horizon that corresponds to the critical frequency @xmath23",
    ". these findings are consistent with a hawking spectrum that deviates from the perfect planck curve ( [ planck ] ) .",
    "the article states @xcite : ` the hawking distribution at low energies is thermal in the sense that the population goes like @xmath24 ' .",
    "this refers to the low - frequency limit of the planck curve , the rayleigh - jeans limit : @xmath25 however , in the experiment @xcite the length scale of the transsonic region is comparable with the scale @xmath16 of the dispersion . there is no guarantee that the constant @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ rayleigh ] ) has the meaning of a hawking temperature ( [ temp ] ) that is proportional to the velocity gradient .",
    "for example , an infinitely steep step from subsonic to supersonic speed would , according to eq .",
    "( [ temp ] ) , create an infinite hawking temperature , yet due to dispersion the population is finite and behaves for small @xmath26 like eq .",
    "( [ rayleigh ] ) as well @xcite .    in the experiment ,",
    "the hawking temperature is inferred from fitting the particle population obtained outside of the horizon with a planck curve that is linearly brought to zero at @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "[ stein5 ] ) .",
    "the standard deviation of the fit , 0.025 , lies within the error bar , 0.028 , of the data , but a simple linear fit would give a standard deviation of 0.039 , which is only marginally worse than the fit used to infer the hawking temperature .",
    "no measurement of the velocity gradient at the horizon was reported @xcite .",
    "hence one can not claim that the inferred @xmath8 is indeed a hawking temperature nor that the spectrum is planckian , as was claimed @xcite .",
    "hawking radiation is predicted @xcite to be maximally entangled ; each hawking phonon that escapes from the horizon leaves a partner particle behind that drifts away on the other side . the experiment @xcite attempts to verify this prediction .",
    "figure [ stein6 ] ( taken from fig .",
    "6a of the article @xcite ) shows the correlations between the claimed hawking partners inferred from measurements of the density  density correlations of the condensate .",
    "the figure shows no entanglement for @xmath28 inside the horizon that corresponds ( fig .",
    "[ stein3 ] ) to @xmath29 outside the horizon where the agreement with the planck curve ( [ planck ] ) is best ( fig .",
    "[ stein5 ] ) .",
    "it does display entanglement for medium @xmath19 , but then it goes on to show correlations beyond the critical @xmath20 where no hawking particles were observed , which is impossible .",
    "one easily derives @xcite from the cauchy - schwarz inequality for the correlation @xmath30 of hawking ( h ) and partner ( p ) particles @xmath31 where the @xmath32 are annihilation operators .",
    "the bounds ( [ bounds ] ) are valid for all quantum states , regardless of the specific values of the populations @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "in particular , the correlation must vanish for vanishing @xmath33 or @xmath34 : no correlation exists without population , yet the article @xcite shows correlations there ( see the data reproduced in fig .",
    "[ stein6 ] ) .    ]",
    "hawking radiation is maximally entangled @xcite in the sense that the populations of the hawking partners are the same , @xmath35 with @xmath2 given by the planck spectrum ( [ planck ] ) , and the bounds ( [ bounds ] ) are reached : @xmath36 relation ( [ heisenberg ] ) is called @xcite the `` heisenberg limit '' ( although it does not originate @xcite from heisenberg s uncertainty relation ) . the measured correlations ( fig .",
    "[ stein6 ] ) appear to have reached the `` heisenberg limit '' for large wavenumbers  beyond @xmath20 . here",
    "the population curve @xmath2 in @xmath37 was convoluted with a gaussian @xcite ( fig .  [ convolution ] ) .",
    "the rationale for the convolution is the following : as the experiment lasts for a finite time @xmath38 the frequencies @xmath26 have the uncertainty @xmath39 .",
    "the dispersion curve @xmath40 for phonons inside the horizon reaches a maximum at @xmath20 , and so @xmath41 tends to @xmath42 there ; small uncertaintes in frequencies result in large wavenumber uncertainties , which increases the error bars of @xmath19 near @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "[ stein3 ] ) .",
    "there are two contributions to the error bars : the finite extensions of the observation regions and the finite observation time ; for @xmath43 the latter dominates .    ]",
    "convoluting the population curve @xmath2 in @xmath37 with a gaussian fits the last four data points of the correlation data ( fig .",
    "[ stein6 ] ) if the standard deviation @xmath44 of the gaussian is set to the constant @xmath45 for @xmath19 in units of @xmath46 .",
    "this @xmath44 lies slightly above the maximal error bar @xmath47 obtained from the dispersion measurements ( fig .",
    "[ stein3 ] ) .",
    "the agreement with theory for the data points at the tail of the `` heisenberg limit '' is seen @xcite as the strongest evidence for the entanglement of hawking radiation .",
    "however , the gaussian smoothing with maximal error bar is only justified in the vicinity of @xmath20 , as the dispersion measurements show ( fig .",
    "[ stein3 ] ) . taking the variation of @xmath44 into account",
    "@xcite moves the curve of @xmath37 below the correlation curve ( fig .",
    "[ convolution ] ) : the observed correlations violate the `` heisenberg limit '' for large wavenumbers .    for smaller wavenumbers , the correlations drop significantly below the prediction of maximal entanglement , eq .",
    "( [ heisenberg ] ) .",
    "the article @xcite states that here the hawking pairs are less correlated than expected or are produced in smaller quantities .",
    "the latter , however , would contradict the population measurements .",
    "the two indications for hawking radiation , the planck spectrum for small wavenumbers and the alleged maximal entanglement for large wave numbers , are not consistent .    ,",
    "title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "perhaps these inconsistencies disappear if all uncertainties in the experiment are taken into account ( fig .",
    "[ errors ] ) .",
    "so far , it was assumed that the populations and correlations are functions of perfectly sharp wavenumber , except in the gaussian smoothing of the population curve for fitting the `` heisenberg limit '' @xmath37 to the tail of the correlation data .",
    "however , the wavenumbers do carry uncertainties ( fig .",
    "[ stein3 ] ) , primarily due to the finite sizes of the two observation regions ( one outside , one inside the horizon ) . especially the correlations @xmath48 and",
    "@xmath49 are sensitive to statistical errors , as they depend on two wavenumbers , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 in fig .  [ stein3 ] ) .",
    "the correlation data is plotted as function of @xmath54 where @xmath50 is related to @xmath51 via the dispersion curves ( fig .",
    "[ stein3 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the error distribution of the wavenumber used for plotting is a convolution of the two individual error distributions . assuming them to be gaussian , the total variance @xmath55 is the sum of the two individual variances , @xmath56 one reads off the error bars from the dispersion measurements ( fig .",
    "[ stein3 ] ) and interpolates them @xcite . figure [ errors ] shows the result : if the uncertainties of the wavenumbers are taken into account the data of the correlations is only distinguishable from the data of the populations squared for one standard deviation , the two data sets melt into each other for @xmath57 .",
    "so , either one accepts inconsistencies in the data or the data become statistically insignificant .",
    "additionally , assumptions were made throughout the data analysis based on the expectation of hawking radiation . for quantifying the degree of entanglement ,",
    "the correlation was compared with the population of only one of the hawking partners ( the one outside the horizon ) and not also with the population of the other .",
    "the article @xcite contains a hint @xcite that also the population of the hawking partners was measured , but the data were not published . for analysing the entanglement ,",
    "it was assumed that @xmath33 and @xmath34 were the same . however , this was part of hawking s prediction , eq .",
    "( [ pairs ] ) , and can not be taken for granted .",
    "assumptions were also made in the method @xcite of obtaining the particle correlations from the experimental data .",
    "the correlations were inferred from subsets of the data integrated along lines parallel to a line of expected correlations ( see fig .  4 of the article @xcite ) , a line found by optimisation .",
    "this method selects the fourier ",
    "components of the density  density correlations evaluated within a subset of the data that would be consistent with the expected particle correlations .",
    "all other fourier  components were ignored .",
    "although this would give the hawking correlations if they are there , it does not allow a comparison with the level of the other fourier components : it does not discriminate between signal and noise , nor between signal and background .",
    "the method of extracting correlations @xcite involves another vital assumption : it assumes that only the hawking partners are generated in accelerating the condensate beyond the speed of sound , but no other excitations in the fluid . as justification ,",
    "the article states @xcite : ` the neglected terms represent correlations between widely separated phonons on opposite sides of the horizon with different frequencies . '",
    "however , this statement contradicts the dispersion measurements @xcite .",
    "figure  [ stein3]a shows the wavenumbers and frequencies for the two possible modes of excitations inside the horizon ( represented by filled and open circles in the figure ) : the hawking waves attempting to travel against the flow and waves traveling with the flow .",
    "one sees that their wavenumbers and frequencies are similar . neglecting the influence of extra excitations on the density  density correlation amounts to an assumption that has not been independently verified in the article @xcite .",
    "this paper has analysed the evidence for the observation of quantum hawking radiation and its entanglement in the recent article @xcite and found severe problems on several accounts . _ first _ , the observed spectrum of hawking radiation is not planckian , although the paper claims it to be .",
    "_ second _ , particle correlations are observed without particles being present , unless , _ third _ , wavenumber uncertainties reduce the statistical confidence to one standard deviation , _ i.e. _  to insignificance .",
    "_ fourth _ , no measurement of the population of hawking partners was reported .",
    "_ fifth _ , the method of inferring particle correlations from the measured density ",
    "density correlations relies on the expectation that hawking radiation is present and nothing else .",
    "overall , an unbiased , blind analysis of the data was not reported , which does not conform to the standards of claiming a discovery .    instead of attempting to fully confirm hawking s theory @xcite in the laboratory , the experiment @xcite may have missed discovering a different interesting phenomenon , like its predecessor @xcite . a recent experiment @xcite with water instead of a bose - einstein condensate",
    "has made a surprising discovery : hidden in the ripples of the water surface , the analogue of hawking radiation was revealed and correlations between hawking waves were seen . there the slight turbulence of the water played the role of the quantum vacuum , stimulating hawking radiation .",
    "while classical fluids like water can not show quantum entanglement , the situation is different in quantum fluids . here quantum fluctuations other than the ones of the vacuum can create entanglement .",
    "for example , seeding the hawking process @xcite with a coherent state @xcite does produce entanglement @xcite .",
    "such situations may mimic hawking radiation in some aspects , but not in others , which , apart from statistical uncertainty , might explain the puzzling results of the article @xcite .    while the experimental data of the article @xcite are valid , although incomplete , the conclusions and claims are not , especially the claim of having observed entanglement with a statistical confidence of @xmath58 , which reduces to the order of @xmath59 on closer inspection .",
    "the 750 gev bump in the lhc data had a statistical confidence of @xmath60 , but still turned out to be a coincidence @xcite .",
    "one can not claim that quantum hawking radiation and its entanglement has been observed by the standards of a discovery .",
    "what has been observed is a matter of debate .    _",
