    "the connection between long duration gamma - ray bursts ( lgrbs ) and hydrogen poor type ic supernovae has become well established based on the detection of spectroscopic signatures of these supernovae accompanying a handful of relatively local grbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the grb - sne sample increases when combined with a larger set of events which exhibit photometric signatures in their lightcurves , consistent with sne ic ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . although , these light curve  humps \" are not uniquely diagnostic of the supernova type , and are open to alternative interpretations , the emerging scenario is that at the majority of long grbs are associated with type ic supernovae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the picture painted by observations of such grb - sne pairs has remained unsatisfactory in some respects . on average ,",
    "these local events differ substantially from the majority of the grb population in terms of energy release , with isotropic energy releases ( @xmath7 ) a factor of @xmath8 lower than the bulk population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "of the bursts with the strongest evidence for sne , only grb  030329 , with @xmath9 erg appears close to a being a classical cosmological long - grb .",
    "several local grb / sne pairs exhibit @xmath10-ray emission of extremely long duration @xcite , while other very long events at larger redshift show little evidence for sne @xcite .",
    "indeed , these local , low luminosity bursts have been suggested to arise from a very different physical mechanism than the classical bursts , such as relativistic shock break - out from the supernova itself ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such emission is difficult to locate in more luminous grbs due to a combination of distance and glare from the burst itself , although evidence for possible shock break - out components has been found in some grbs @xcite .",
    "however , the several order of magnitude difference in energy release between the local , low - luminosity and cosmological , high luminosity grbs could also be indicative of rather different physical mechanisms at play . given this , the nature of the connection between the most energetic grbs and their supernovae remains in urgent need of further study .",
    "here we report observations of the brightest ( highest fluence ) grb detected in the past @xmath220 years , grb 130427a .",
    "the isotropic energy release of @xmath11 erg , places it in the most luminous 5% of grbs observed to date by _ swift _ , and a factor of 100 brighter than grb 030329 @xcite which was the most luminous grb with a well studied supernova . at a redshift of @xmath12",
    "@xcite the burst is close enough that any supernova is open to spectroscopic study , and indeed the presence of a supernova , sn  2013cq , has been established @xcite .",
    "here we use the resolution of the _ hubble space telescope _ to resolve and dramatically reduce the galaxy contribution , and its uv capability to track the afterglow , hence enabling a view of the supernova as free as possible from the host , afterglow and atmospheric hinderance .",
    "grb  130427a was discovered by _ swift _ at 07:47:57 ut on 27 april 2013 @xcite .",
    "it was also detected as an exceptionally bright grb by _ konus - wind _ and _ fermi _ with gbm @xcite and lat @xcite , and its prompt fluence of @xmath13 ergs @xmath14 in the 10 - 1000 kev band @xcite makes it the most fluent grb observed by _ swift _ , fermi or batse .",
    "it showed a bright x - ray and optical afterglow , peaking at r=7.4 before the _ swift _ grb trigger @xcite .",
    "early spectroscopy of the afterglow yielded a redshift of @xmath12 @xcite , which was confirmed from later , more detailed spectroscopic observations @xcite .",
    "a full description of the afterglow is given in @xcite .",
    "deep photometric and spectroscopic observations over the first 10 days post burst revealed a re - brightening , consistent with the presence of a type ic supernova , sn  2013cq @xcite .",

    "a second epoch was obtained in april 2014 , almost a year after the initial burst .",
    "a log of these observations is shown in table  [ hst ] . for more detailed study of the host galaxy",
    "we also utilize a longer ( 2228 s ) wfc3/f606w observation obtained on 15 may 2014 .",
    "the imaging data were reduced in the standard fashion ; with on - the - fly processed data retrieved from the archive and subsequently re - drizzled using astrodrizzle , for uvis observations we separately corrected for pixel based charge transfer inefficiency ( cte ) @xcite .",
    "photometry was performed in small apertures to minimize any contribution from underlying galaxy light , and maximise signal to noise , it was subsequently corrected using standard aperture corrections .",
    "we also use direct image subtraction to isolate the afterglow / sne light at early epochs , this effectively removes the host contribution .",
    "these magnitudes may still contain some transient light , but since the second epoch magnitudes are a factor of @xmath2 15 - 30 lower than observed at early times , this suggests that these epochs can be used for effective subtraction.the resulting photometry is shown in table  [ hst ] , while our _ hst _ images are shown in figure  [ hst ] .",
    "we also obtained grism spectroscopy centered at @xmath16 with the g800l grism on acs , with a position angle chosen to minimize the contribution from the underlying host galaxy ( see figure  [ hst ] ) .",
    "again we utilized the on - the - fly calibrated images , corrected for cte and bias striping .",
    "we detected sources on a single f606w image , and extracted these via axe , subsequently drizzling each of the four exposures to create master spectra , which was flux calibrated using published sensitivity curves .",
    "we extracted the light from the grb counterpart in a relatively small aperture ( @xmath17 ) . in principle a given pixel in the grism image may be exposed to light of multiple different wavelengths from different spatial locations on the chip .",
    "for the second epoch of observations we force an extraction of the same width at the position of the transient ( as determined by a map between the first and second epoch of direct imaging ) .",
    "we then subtract this from the initial spectrum to obtain a host free spectrum .",
    "since we have utilised a tight aperture around the sne we subsequently scale this subtracted spectrum to the host subtracted magnitudes of the afterglow / sne .",
    "the afterglow is offset ( @xmath18 ) from the centroid of the host galaxy light in f606w , and so the latter is of little concern in our small ( 0.1 ) apertures .",
    "however , regions underlying grbs are frequently amongst the most luminous parts of their hosts @xcite , so some contamination may be expected .",
    "our late time subtraction removes this from both our broad band photometry and grism spectroscopy . for the high resolution observations reported here",
    "this contamination is small ( at most 6% in the uv and 3% in the optical ) for our photometry .",
    "however , the contribution is somewhat larger in the grism observations .",
    "these observations disperse light not only from the region directly underlying the grb , but also from other locations in the host ( which represent contributions at different wavelengths , overlapping the transient light ) .",
    "in particular , the proximate , bright star forming region contaminates the sne considerably ( @xmath1920% at the red end of our spectrum beyond 9000 ) .",
    "this region is also likely to be the dominant host contaminant in ground based spectroscopy ( since the host galaxy is resolved ) , and has quite different colours from the global host , implying potentially significant systematic errors when the broadband sdss colours of the host are used to attempt a subtraction ( e.g. xu et al .",
    "2013 , melandri et al .",
    "2014 ) . here",
    "we can directly remove this contribution via the subtraction of the deep second epoch .",
    "sne ib / c are generally weak uv emitters due to the strong metal line blanketing shortward of @xmath20 , so to first order our f336w observations should be free of supernova contribution .",
    "this is consistent with the uv colours of grb060218/sn2006aj ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and of xrf100316d / sn2010bh ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which would predict a factor @xmath21 decrease in flux between f606w and f336w .",
    "there are few uv spectra of sn ic , however if we graft the stis uv observations of sn  2002ap onto the optical spectra of sn  1998bw following @xcite then we can obtain a first order approximation of the likely uv spectral shape ( see figure  [ sn ] ) .",
    "these colours and spectra suggest it is reasonable to assume that the f336w light is dominated by the afterglow component . to confirm this we utilize the uv to ir lightcurve from @xcite .",
    "this exhibits a spectral slope of @xmath22 with @xmath23 and predicts u(ab)=23.41 @xmath15 0.10 at the time of the first epoch of _ hst _ f336w observations .",
    "the corresponding _ hst _ uv magnitude is f336w(ab)=23.28 @xmath15 0.02 .",
    "corrected for foreground absorption this is consistent with the afterglow contributing 90@xmath1510% of the measured f336w flux , confirming our assumptions above .",
    "this afterglow model predicts f160w(ab ) = 21.84 , somewhat fainter than the measured magnitude and suggesting that the supernova makes up @xmath220% of the light in this band , again in keeping with expectations of the few ir spectra of broad - lined sne ic obtained to - date ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we estimate the supernova contribution by using the model above , with initial error bars accounting for the uncertainty in the f336w afterglow light , discussed above , and the intrinsic value of @xmath24 , which we adopt to be 0.92 @xmath25 . for this range of models",
    "we then subtract the afterglow spectrum from the measured grism data , and neglect any host galaxy contamination .",
    "the extremum of this model is set by the assumption that both f336w and f160w are entirely dominated by afterglow , and by subtracting the resulting power - law index .",
    "our grism spectrum , both before and after subtraction of the afterglow and host light , is shown in figure  [ sn ] ( top and bottom ) .",
    "broad features , consistent with those seen in other high velocity sn ic associated with grbs are clearly visible in the spectrum , even before subtraction of the afterglow component . the absence of broad emission at h@xmath26 or he absorption rules out type ii or ib events respectively . in the lower panel of figure  [ sn ]",
    "we plot rest - frame wavelength versus luminosity comparisons of the afterglow subtracted and de - reddened spectra of sn  2013cq with various grb / sne pairs .",
    "the closest match for the overall spectral shape and luminosity is that of sn  1998bw @xcite .",
    "the similarity in appearance of these sne is primarily due to the overall spectral shape , with a drop in luminosity of a factor of @xmath2 3 over the 5000 - 7000   range , substantially more than seen in other grb / sne pairs .",
    "the broad colours of these sne are similar , and if the kink at @xmath27   is interpreted as the siii ( 6355 ) blend then it would be indicative of a photospheric velocity similar to sn  1998bw at the same epoch ( @xmath28 km s@xmath4 ) , although we note that this feature is apparently stronger in sn  1998bw , where there is marked upturn in flux redward of it .",
    "this may suggest a somewhat higher velocity for sn  2013cq .",
    "taken at face value this would suggest that sn  2013cq is broadly similar in peak luminosity , @xmath29ni production and kinetic energy to sn  1998bw .",
    "while the similarity to sn  1998bw is very marked over the rest frame spectral range from 5100 - 7000   it is much poorer around the central peak of an sn ic at @xmath30 . in sn  2013cq",
    "this feature appears to be broader , and blueshifted relative to sn  1998bw , as observed by @xcite .",
    "our comparison suggests that this peak may fit better with the slightly higher velocity sn 2003dh @xcite , the only one of the comparison sne to arise from a luminous cosmological grb . in this case , the sn  2003dh model shown in figure 2 remains a factor of 50% less luminous than sn  2013cq , and is systematically redder ( i.e. a smaller decrement between the peak and @xmath31 ) .",
    "however , the positions of the broadened lines do then appear generally similar .",
    "alternatively , this could be suggestive of a much higher velocity supernova such as sn  2010bh @xcite as favoured by @xcite , who infer @xmath32 km s@xmath4 from the feii ( 5169 ) at an epoch of 12.5 rest - frame days .",
    "this does provide a good match to the location and width of the feature ; however , the overall spectral shape and luminosity of sn  2010bh are also very different from sn  2013cq . at 17 days",
    "sn  2013cq appears to be much bluer , and a factor @xmath193 times more luminous than sn  2010bh , suggesting it is not as good an analog as sn  1998bw . to obtain a match in both luminosity and general spectral shape",
    "would require that the reddening in the direction of sn  2010bh had been significantly underestimated .",
    "our plotted spectrum assumes @xmath33 and @xmath34 = 0.14 @xcite . to obtain a match",
    "would require de - reddening the spectra with an _ additional _ @xmath35 , well beyond the values allowed from the na i d doublet observed in moderate resolution x - shooter spectroscopy @xcite and even the largest extinctions allowed by the afterglow spectrum @xcite .",
    "hence , we disfavour the suggestion that the underlying sne is similar to sn  2010bh , due to the significant disparity in the luminosity .",
    "instead we favour a sne similar in @xmath29ni yield and kinetic energy to sn  1998bw and sn  2003dh , in which possible velocity structure within the ejecta gives rise to a range of features within the spectra that do not provide a unique match to any previous grb / sne pair .",
    "indeed , the recent study of @xcite also identifies a source which is much brighter than sn  2010bh , but spectrally intermediate between sn  1998bw and sn  2010bh .    despite these differences ,",
    "it is clear that the features observed in the spectrum of sn  2013cq are broadly compatible to the range observed in sn / grb pairs , although a full model description of the spectrum is beyond the scope of this paper . to obtain approximate bounds on the luminosity of the supernova",
    "we integrate our afterglow and host subtracted spectra ( allowing for the errors in the afterglow parameters ) through through a rest - frame v - band filter to obtain a luminosity relative to sn  1998bw .",
    "this suggests that sn  2013cq has a luminosity factor @xmath36 of @xmath37 .",
    "given the suggestions that sn  2013cq is more rapidly evolving than sn  1998bw @xcite , these observations ( at the v - band peak of sn  1998bw ) may underestimate by true peak luminosity , which may be even closer to that of sn  1998bw .",
    "grb  130427a is unusual as a luminous grb at a redshift at which the supernovae are open to detailed study .",
    "indeed , it the the highest luminosity burst for which there is spectroscopic evidence for a supernova . in this regard the similarity of the supernova to that seen in a burst ( grb 980425 ) that was six orders of magnitude less energetic is striking . as we show in figure  [ eiso ]",
    "there is no correlation between the grb energetics and the inferred peak magnitudes of their sne .",
    "these similarities in sne peak luminosity , and in their spectra suggest similarities in the ejected @xmath29ni masses and kinetic energies .",
    "recent modelling @xcite has used these diagnostics to suggest that most broad - lined sn ic associated with low luminosity grbs in turn arise from a relatively small range of zams progenitor masses , perhaps between @xmath38 m@xmath6 .",
    "the detection of a similar sn in a highly luminous grb extends this across a broader range of energy .",
    "our _ hst _ observations clearly resolve the afterglow from the host galaxy , showing the grb to lie at a spatial offset of 0.83 , ( 4.0 kpc at @xmath0 ) from the centre of its host .",
    "this is a relatively large offset for a grb from its host galaxy ( @xmath39% of those in @xcite ) although by no means exceptional ( see figure 3 ) . in the f606w observations the galaxy exhibits a bar - like structure with a face - on disk visible beyond this , a weak spiral structure is also apparent , making the host one of few",
    "to be classified as a spiral @xcite .",
    "the f336w imaging shows weak star formation close to the centre of the galaxy , but the most striking feature is a strong star forming region at a similar radial offset to the grb , but offset from the grb position by 0.3(1.5 kpc ) .",
    "this region the strongest region of star formation in the host galaxy . while the magnitude of star formation underlying the grb position remains uncertain because of contamination with the late time afterglow , the offset region is at least a factor of @xmath40 brighter .",
    "it also shows readily detectable oiii emission in the late time grism spectrum .",
    "the weak spiral arm in the direction of the grb also appears distorted , and so it may be that star formation has been triggered via a tidal interaction . in the larger field around grb  130427a",
    "we note several galaxies of similar magnitude ( see figure  [ hst ] ) . in our grism",
    "spectroscopy these galaxies do not exhibit strong spectral lines , but they may well imply that the host of grb  130427a lies within an association .",
    "the magnitude of the galaxy in a large aperture at late times after the afterglow / sne has significantly faded is f336w(ab)=22.84 @xmath15 0.07 at a rest - frame wavelength of approximately 2500 .",
    "this corresponds to a uv star formation rate of @xmath41 m@xmath6 yr@xmath4 ( error statistical only ) , broadly in agreement with that inferred from the sdss observed sed of the galaxy of @xmath42 m@xmath6 yr@xmath4 @xcite , and suggesting a relatively ( but not extremely ) low specific star formation rate by the standards of grb hosts @xcite . the compact star forming region close to the grb contains @xmath210% of this star formation , making a highly luminous star forming region comparable to that seen in the host of grb 980425/sn  1998bw @xcite or in a handful of other local galaxies @xcite .",
    "at late times uv emission is visible close to the grb position , indicating that lower level star formation is likely arising proximate to the grb .",
    "this may still contain some afterglow light , but this region is at least a factor @xmath43 fainter than the brightest star forming region in the host .    some previously extremely energetic bursts ( e.g. grb 080319b , @xcite ) have shown extremely faint and small host galaxies , while the hosts of grbs 980425 , 030329 and 060218 are also sub - luminous and lmc - like .",
    "however , as show in figure  3 the overall population of grb - sn host luminosities is shows no discernible correlation with the energy of the grb ( see also @xcite ) , and the host of grb  130427a is in keeping with these expectations . it is intriguing to note that the grb host galaxy with the closest properties to that of grb 130427a / sn  2013cq is in fact the host of sn  1998bw .",
    "it is also a rare example of a spiral galaxy , in which the grb occurs at a moderately large offset from the nucleus , and from the strongest region of star formation within the host galaxy .",
    "this is shown graphically in figure  [ 98bwcomp ] .",
    "given the similarities in supernova and environment grb  130427a would seem like a close analog of grb 980425a if it were not for the factor of @xmath44 difference in their @xmath10-ray energy releases .",
    "we have presented _ hst _ imaging and spectroscopic observations of the extremely bright grb 130427a , which show it was associated with a luminous broad line sn ic ( sn 2013cq ) . the red spectra offer good agreement with those of sn  1998bw , while the bluer spectra appear well matched in position if not shape with sn  2010bh .",
    "the host galaxy appears to be a disk galaxy of moderate luminosity and star formation rate , whose overall characteristics are consistent with those of the grb host population at large . the similar properties of the sne and hosts over six orders of magnitude in grb isotropic equivalent energy would appear to suggest that the energy of the grb is not a strong function of environment or the mass of the progenitor star , and that stars of similar mass and composition are responsible for the entire luminosity function of grbs .",
    "more complex effects within the star ( e.g. rotation ) or geometric effects are therefore needed to explain much of the diversity in the grb luminosity function .     for _ swift _ grbs ( from * ? ? ?",

    "the two errors bars marked in the case of sn  2013cq represent the error associated with a simple afterglow subtraction and the extrema of possibilities ( see text for details ) .",

    "the colour coding is the same as for the lower plot , while grey triangles indicate values from the literature for grbs without claimed sne associations ( data from @xcite ) .",
