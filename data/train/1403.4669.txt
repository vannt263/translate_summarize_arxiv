    "cognitive radio networks is a promising technology to address the spectrum scarcity and the inefficient spectrum usage of present wireless systems  @xcite .",
    "cognitive radio networks allow unlicensed secondary users ( sus ) access to the spectrum of the licensed primary users ( pus ) , without impairing the performance of the pus . depending on the spectrum access strategy ,",
    "there are three main cognitive radio network paradigms : interweave , underlay and overlay  @xcite . in the _ interweave cognitive networks _ , the sus are not allowed to cause any interference to the pus .",
    "thus , sus must periodically sense the environment to detect spectrum occupancy and transmit opportunistically only when the pus are silent  @xcite . in the _ underlay cognitive networks _ , sus can concurrently use the spectrum occupied by a pu by guaranteeing that the interference at the pu is below some acceptable threshold .",
    "thus , sus must know the channel strengths to the pus and are also allowed to communicate with each other in order to sense how much interference is being created to the pus  @xcite . in the _ overlay cognitive networks _ , there is tight interaction and active cooperation between the pus and the sus . thus , sus use sophisticated signal processing and coding to maintain or improve the pu transmissions while also obtaining some additional bandwidth for their own transmission  @xcite .",
    "note that hybrid spectrum access strategies , appropriately combining the above three paradigms , have also been proposed  @xcite .    for underlay cognitive networks , which are considered in this paper ,",
    "it is very important to investigate the interference arising from the sus to a pu . this interference impacts the outage probability at a pu , which is the probability that the signal to interference plus noise ratio ( sinr ) falls below a given threshold .",
    "the interference and outage in underlay cognitive networks has been recently investigated in the literature  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the aggregate interference at a typical pu and a typical su inside an infinite area cognitive network , taking the exclusion region around pus into account , were presented in  @xcite and bounds on the outage probability with rayleigh fading channels were also derived .",
    "the closed - form results for the moment generating function ( mgf ) of the aggregate interference and the mean interference at an annulus - center - located pu were derived in  @xcite .",
    "a framework for characterizing the aggregate interference in cognitive networks was proposed in  @xcite for the disk region under the rayleigh fading channel assumption .",
    "therein , closed - form results were obtained for the special case that the path - loss exponent is @xmath0 or @xmath1 with an arbitrary location of pu inside a disk region . however , in practice the shape of network can be arbitrary and need not be a disk only .",
    "this is especially relevant for emerging ultra - dense small cell deployment scenarios  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the pu may be located anywhere inside the network region .",
    "when sus are confined within an arbitrarily - shaped finite region , the aggregate interference and the outage probability are strongly influenced by the shape of region and the position of the pu . in this context , a method of calculating the approximation of @xmath2-th cumulant inside a non - circular region by dividing the areas into infinitesimal circular sections was suggested in  @xcite but no explicit formulation was provided .",
    "therefore , it is still largely an open research problem to find general frameworks for analyzing the interference and outage in arbitrarily - shaped finite underlay cognitive networks .    in underlay cognitive networks ,",
    "there are several ways to control the interference generated by the sus in order to satisfy the interference threshold , e.g. , using multiple antennas to guide the su signals away from the pu  @xcite , using resource ( i.e. , rate and power ) allocation among the sus  @xcite or using spread spectrum techniques to spread the su signals below the noise floor  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the simplest solution to control the interference generated by the sus , which is considered in this work , is to employ the su activity protocols , i.e. , to simply limit the number of active sus  @xcite . in this context ,",
    "@xcite considered an exclusion or guard zone around the pus , within which sus are not allowed to transmit .",
    "a threshold - based protocol was proposed in  @xcite , where the activity of each su depends on the instantaneous power received at the su from the pu .",
    "it must be noted that if no activity constraint is imposed on sus then this is equivalent to the well - studied case of wireless ad hoc networks where all users can transmit  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a general framework for analyzing the performance of arbitrarily - shaped underlay cognitive networks , with arbitrary location of the pu and different su activity protocols .",
    "we make the following major contributions in this paper :    * we utilize cooperation among sus in underlay cognitive networks to come up with a cooperation - based su activity protocol .",
    "this protocol utilizes the local information exchange among sus and includes the threshold - based protocol as a special case .",
    "we derive approximate yet accurate expressions for the mgf and the @xmath2-th cumulant of the aggregate interference from sus with the cooperation - based protocol . *",
    "we derive the general expressions for the mgf and @xmath2-th cumulant of the aggregate interference at an arbitrarily located pu inside an arbitrarily - shaped region for the existing su activity protocols .",
    "we show that many existing closed - form results in the literature for the interference analysis in the primary network can be obtained as special cases in our framework .",
    "in addition , we derive a closed - form result for the average number of active sus . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time that such a result has been obtained in the literature for the case of underlay cognitive network .",
    "* we study the average number of active sus for the different su activity protocols , subject to a given outage probability constraint at the pu .",
    "we show that the guard zone protocol supports the highest number of active sus , followed by the proposed cooperation - based protocol and then the threshold - based protocol .",
    "the advantage of the cooperation - based protocol over the guard zone protocol is that it relies on the sus only knowing the instantaneous channel strengths to the pus .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ systemmodel ] presents the detailed system model and assumptions and describes the three different su activity protocols , including the proposed cooperation - based protocol .",

    "@xmath16 is the generalized incomplete gamma function and @xmath17 $ ] is the gaussian or ordinary hypergeometric function  @xcite .",
    "we consider an underlay cognitive network with a pu link , comprising of a pu transmitter ( pu - tx ) and a pu receiver ( pu - rx ) separated by a distance @xmath18 , and @xmath19 sus .",
    "the network region @xmath20 is an arbitrarily - shaped finite region , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 denotes the two - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "we do not place any restriction on the location of the pu - tx and pu - rx and they can be located anywhere inside the network region @xmath20 . a primary exclusion zone @xmath23 , with radius @xmath24 , is formed around the pu - rx and no active user is allowed to enter this region  @xcite .",
    "the su locations are modeled according to a uniform binomial point process , i.e. , the @xmath19 sus are independently and uniformly distributed ( i.u.d . ) at random inside the region @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "the sus decide whether to transmit or not depending on the adopted su activity protocol ( discussed later in this section ) .",
    "we assume that all the nodes operate in the frequency division duplex mode .",
    "similar to  @xcite , we assume that in order to know the channel strength to pu - rx each su receives a signal transmitted by pu - rx via a sensing channel .",
    "we assume that this sensing channel ( from pu - rx to su ) and the su transmitting ( i.e. , interfering ) channel ( from su to pu - rx ) are well separated in the frequency band so that these two channels can be regarded as fully uncorrelated .",
    "+     +   +    let the rv @xmath27 @xmath28 denote the random distance between the @xmath29-th su and the pu - rx with probability distribution function @xmath30 .",
    "we denote the transmit power of the pu - tx as @xmath31 , the transmit power of each su as @xmath32 and the transmit power of pu - rx as @xmath33 .",
    "we assume that all users have a single antenna and the wireless communication channel is modeled as a path - loss and fading channel .",
    "let @xmath34 represent the instantaneous power gain due to fading on the su transmitting channel from @xmath29-th su to the pu - rx with fading distribution function @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent the instantaneous fading power gain on the sensing channel with the distribution function @xmath37 .    for the above setup , the interference at the pu - rx generated from the @xmath29-th su is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the path - loss exponent which is typically in the range @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "the indicator function is given by @xmath41    where the  condition \" depends on the different su activity protocols and the explicit expressions for each protocol are given in  ,   and  , respectively .",
    "in addition , although the unbounded path - loss model is used in  , the singularity at @xmath42 and the amplification of the transmitted signal are avoided because of the primary exclusion zone around the pu - rx , i.e. , the random distance @xmath27 is always greater than @xmath24 ( @xmath43 )  @xcite .    the aggregate interference at pu - rx is given by @xmath44    in the following subsections , we present the definition of each su activity protocol .",
    "the guard zone protocol was employed in  @xcite . in this protocol",
    ", the sus are permitted to enter the guard zone region but once a su intrudes into it , it is prohibited from transmitting .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ guardzone ] , where there is a guard zone region around the pu - rx with radius @xmath45 .",
    "consequently , the two sus that are inside this region are inactive and do not generate any interference to the pu - rx .",
    "the aggregate interference under the guard zone protocol can be written as @xmath46      the threshold - based protocol was proposed in  @xcite . in this protocol",
    ", each su receives the instantaneous signal power transmitted by the pu - rx on the sensing channel .",
    "if the received instantaneous signal power at the @xmath29-th su is greater than the activation threshold @xmath47 , i.e. , @xmath48 , it becomes silent and does not interfere with the pu - rx .",
    "otherwise , it is permitted to transmit , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ singlethreshold ] .",
    "hence , for the threshold - based protocol , the aggregate interference can be written as @xmath49      this is the new protocol proposed in this paper and is illustrated in fig .",
    "the basic idea of this protocol is inspired from the cooperative spectrum sensing in interweave cognitive networks , where cooperation among nodes helps to improve the detection of licensed spectrum occupancy  @xcite .    in the proposed cooperation - based protocol for underlay cognitive networks ,",
    "each su receives the instantaneous signal power transmitted by the pu - rx on the sensing channel and forms an initial decision on activation .",
    "then this initial decision is broadcast to other sus . for analytical convenience",
    ", we assume that , for each su , it can only correctly receive the initial decisions from other sus within a certain range , which is known as its cooperation range @xmath50 . finally , in order to decide whether it is active or not , each su applies the and rule on the received initial decisions from other cooperating sus and its own initial decision .",
    "consequently , for a considered su , it is permitted to be active as long as its preliminary decision is to be active , and the initial decision of all sus which fall into this su s cooperation range is also to be active .",
    "mathematically , the aggregate interference generated at the pu - rx is @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the set of sus whose received instantaneous signal power on the sensing channel is greater than the activation threshold @xmath47 , @xmath53 represents the disk cooperation region centered at the @xmath29-th su and @xmath54 denotes the null set . note that when @xmath55 , the cooperation - based protocol is the same as the threshold - based protocol",
    "thus , the proposed cooperation - based protocol includes the threshold - based protocol as a special case .",
    "both the cooperation - based and threshold - based protocols require the su to receive the instantaneous signal power transmitted by the pu - rx on the sensing channel .",
    "as such , they are much more applicable in practice .",
    "however , the guard zone protocol requires the su to know the instantaneous signal power on the sensing channel over a relatively long period of time and then average it to determine its distance to the pu - rx , before deciding whether to transmit or not . as such",
    ", this protocol is not suitable for the scenarios where the sus need to transmit without too much delay .",
    "in this section , we present the proposed mathematical framework to characterize the interference and outage in underlay cognitive networks with different su activity protocols .",
    "the aggregate interference from the secondary network in   is a stochastic process that strongly relies on the random location of the sus inside the arbitrarily - shaped finite cognitive network region and the random fading channel gains .",
    "since there is no available general expression for the pdf of the aggregate interference  @xcite , we adopt the moment generating function approach to analyze the interference and outage in this paper .",
    "previous work  @xcite has also adopted the mgf approach . however",
    ", their focus is on analysing the statistics of the aggregate interference in the primary network only and the results are limited to specific , e.g. , annulus - shaped regions .",
    "we consider arbitrarily - shaped cognitive network regions and analyze the performance in both the primary network ( i.e. , the aggregate interference in section  [ analysis ] ) and the secondary network ( i.e. , the average number of active sus in section  [ section_averagenode ] ) .      in this paper , we consider that the nodes are independently and uniformly distributed inside the network region @xmath25 , which results in the distribution function of @xmath27 being the same for all @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , the fading gain on all communication channels is independently and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "nakagami-@xmath56 fading .",
    "this type of fading is widely considered in the wireless communications literature  @xcite . the transmit power for different sus",
    "are assumed to be the same .",
    "consequently , the distribution of interference from @xmath29-th su becomes identical and we can drop the index @xmath29 in the @xmath32 , @xmath57 , @xmath27 , @xmath34 , @xmath36 and let @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .    for nakagami-@xmath56 fading , the distribution of the power gain on the su transmitting channel and the sensing channel can be modeled by a gamma distribution as  @xcite @xmath61}\\exp(-m_g g),\\\\ f_{h}(h)=&\\frac{h^{m_h-1}m_h^{m_h}}{\\gamma[m_h]}\\exp(-m_h h),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 represent the fading parameters , which control the severity of the fading . note that @xmath64 corresponds to rayleigh fading channels .",
    "in addition , the @xmath2-th moment of the fading power gain on the su transmitting channel , which is needed in the analysis in section  [ analysis ] , is available in closed - form as  @xcite @xmath65      the proposed formulation relies on the knowledge of the distance distribution @xmath66 , i.e. , the pdf of the distance of a random su from the pu - rx . for a disk region , @xmath66 is well known  @xcite . for an @xmath67-sided arbitrarily - shaped convex polygon ,",
    "@xmath66 can be a complicated piece - wise function with at most @xmath68 piece - wise terms  @xcite .",
    "the number of piece - wise terms depends on the number of unique distances between the location of the reference node and all the sides and vertices , respectively , of the polygon region .",
    "recently ,  @xcite proposed an algorithm to determine @xmath66 for the case of a random node located anywhere inside an arbitrarily - shaped convex polygon .",
    "this algorithm is used in this work to determine @xmath66 in closed - form .",
    "once @xmath66 is determined using the algorithm in  @xcite , the expectation @xmath69 involving the rv @xmath70 , which is needed in the analysis in section  [ analysis ] , can be easily calculated in closed - form .      in general , the moment generating function of the aggregate interference is defined as  @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the expectation with respect to the rv @xmath73 .",
    "assuming that the interference from each su is independent and identical , the moment generating function of the aggregate interference in   can be rewritten as  @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the interference generated by a random su and @xmath76 corresponds to the mgf of @xmath75 .",
    "the @xmath2-th cumulant of the aggregate interference can be written in terms of the mgf of the aggregate interference as  @xcite @xmath77 where the last step comes from the recursive moment - cumulant relationship  @xcite , and @xmath78 and @xmath79 represent the @xmath2-th cumulant and @xmath2-th moment of the interference from a random su respectively .",
    "note that @xmath79 can also be directly related to @xmath80 by  @xcite @xmath81      the outage probability is an important metric to evaluate the impact of su activity protocols on the performance of the primary users over fading channels .",
    "it is given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the sinr threshold and @xmath84 is the additive white gaussian noise power .    in this paper , we are interested in the spatially averaged outage probability which is spatially averaged over both the possible location of the sus and the fading channels .",
    "when the fading on the desired link ( from pu - tx to pu - rx ) follows the general distribution defined in  ( * ? ? ? * ( 9 ) ) ( an important special case of which is nakagami-@xmath56 fading with integer @xmath56 value ) , we can employ the reference link power gain - based ( rlpg - based ) framework proposed in  @xcite to evaluate the spatially averaged outage probability .",
    "the basic principle of this approach is to first condition on the interference and express the outage probability in terms of the cdf of the reference link s fading power gain .",
    "the conditioning on the interference is then removed first by removing the conditioning on the fading power gains of the interferers and then removing the conditioning on the locations of the interferers . for nakagami-@xmath56 fading channels ,",
    "the spatially averaged outage probability is given by  @xcite    @xmath85    @xmath86    where @xmath87 indicates the average signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and @xmath88 denotes the fading parameter on the desired link .    using the frequency differentiation property of laplace transform , the laplace transform of the term @xmath89 is given by @xmath90 .",
    "then the expectation term in   can be expressed in terms of the mgf of the interference due to a random su as @xmath91    examining  ,   and  , we can see that the proposed mathematical formulation depends on the mgf of the interference due to a random su @xmath80 .",
    "this is determined for the different su activity protocols in the next section .",

    "the aggregate interference at the pu - rx and the resulting outage probability are metrics to evaluate the performance of the primary network , which was the common focus of most prior studies on cognitive networks , e.g. ,  @xcite . ideally , the performance of the secondary network should also be evaluated .",
    "furthermore , this should be done subject to a quality - of - service ( qos ) constraint that the sinr of each active su is maintained higher than a desired level .",
    "one way to do this analytically is to determine the su throughput which can be defined as the expected spatial density of successful su transmission and depends on ( i ) the number of active sus over a certain region and ( ii ) whether each active su is in outage or not , i.e. , whether its sinr is above a certain threshold .",
    "the exact sinr distribution of an active su ( and consequently the su throughput ) in an arbitrarily - shaped underlay cognitive network is difficult to obtain because of two main reasons . _",
    "firstly _ , for an arbitrarily - shaped region with a fixed number of nodes , the binomial point process is non - stationary and an active su s sinr is , therefore , location - dependent .",
    "thus , the sinr of an active su at a certain location ( say origin ) does not reflect the sinr of other active sus .",
    "the difficulty in _ analytically averaging _ the active su s sinr over all possible locations in an arbitrarily - shaped region poses a significant challenge for analytical analysis .",
    "_ secondly _ , with the consideration of the different su activity protocols , only the active sus generate interference to other sus and pu - rx .",
    "this means that when accounting for the interference to a su - rx ( which is the desired receiver for a certain su ) , the distance between an interfering su and pu - rx is _ correlated _ to the distance between this interfering su and the su - rx .",
    "this distance correlation poses a second significant challenge for analytical analysis .    in this work , in order to evaluate the performance of the secondary network in underlay cognitive networks , we study the average number of active sus . the average number of active sus is an analytically tractable performance metric , which can indirectly measure the su throughput under certain conditions .",
    "for example , if the sinr threshold for sus is not too high or each su is sufficiently close to its desired receiver , it is possible that almost every active su can transmit successfully . under such conditions",
    ", the average number of active sus plays the dominant role in determining the aggregate throughput of sus .",
    "the main analytical result in this section is presented in theorem  [ theo_meannode ] below .",
    "[ theo_meannode ] for any su activity protocol with independently and uniformly distributed sus inside an arbitrarily - shaped finite region , the average number of active sus is given by @xmath128 where @xmath129 denotes the zero - th moment of the interference at an arbitrarily located pu - rx from a random su , which is dependent on the su activity protocol .",
    "proof : see appendix  [ app_mean_node ] .",
    "theorem  [ theo_meannode ] is valid for any su activity protocol with i.u.d .",

    "fading channels .",
    "for the protocols considered in this work , the value of @xmath130 can be easily computed from  ,   and  , respectively .",
    "intuitively , there is tradeoff between the primary network performance ( i.e. , in terms of the outage probability in the primary network ) and the secondary network performance ( i.e. , in terms of the average number of active sus ) . for example , increasing @xmath45 in the guard zone protocol or decreasing the activation threshold @xmath47 in threshold - based and cooperation - based protocols can reduce the outage probability .",
    "however , this would decrease the number of active secondary users , which means the licensed spectrum is not efficiently reused . in this context ,   and   provide an analytical means for evaluating this tradeoff in the performance of both the primary and secondary networks . in the next section",
    ", we will use the primary - secondary performance tradeoff as a systematic way to compare the performance of the different su activity protocols .",

    "we can see from table  [ tb:1 ] that for the considered case , the proposed cooperation - based protocol has the smallest values of the moments , i.e. , it results in the smallest aggregate interference .",
    "the next best is the threshold - based protocol , followed by the guard zone protocol .      in this subsection",

    "however , the threshold - based protocol and guard zone protocol can only achieve @xmath137 and @xmath138 , respectively .",
    "it must be noted that such an analysis has two main issues .",
    "firstly , for a given shape of the network region and a given location of the pu - rx , the outage at the pu - rx strongly relies on the protocol system parameters ( i.e. , the guard zone range @xmath45 for the guard zone protocol , activation threshold @xmath47 for both of the threshold - based and cooperation - based protocols ) and different values of the protocol system parameters can lead to a different performance ordering of the su activity protocols .",
    "secondly , it focuses on the performance in the primary network only .",
    "these aspects are addressed in the next section  [ result_compare ] .",
    "in this section , we investigate and compare the su activity protocols in terms of their effect on the primary network ( i.e. , the outage probability ) and the secondary network ( i.e. , the average number of active sus ) .    fig .",
    "[ compare ] plots the average number of active sus , @xmath139 , versus the outage probability , @xmath134 , when the pu - rx is located at the intersection point of the two diagonals inside the arbitrarily - shaped finite region specified in section vi - b with @xmath133 m. the results are shown for different values of path - loss exponent @xmath140 ( fig .  [ compare1 ] ) and nakagami-@xmath56 fading @xmath141 ( fig .  [ compare2 ] ) , respectively",
    ". the following approach is adopted to work out these curves for the su activity protocols :    1 .   for each outage probability value ,",
    "using  ,   and theorems @xmath142 , we can find the value of @xmath45 for guard zone protocol and @xmath47 for threshold - based protocol and cooperation - based protocol , respectively ; 2 .",
    "we substitute the value @xmath45 and @xmath47 into   and corollaries @xmath142 to obtain the average number of active sus for each protocol .",
    "[ compare ] shows that for each protocol , the active number of sus is higher if the fading is less severe ( i.e. , @xmath56 has higher value ) or if the path - loss exponent has a higher value . for the same outage probability ,",
    "it is desirable to have a larger average number of active sus . from fig .",
    "[ compare ] , we can see that the guard zone protocol supports the largest number of active sus , followed by the cooperation - based protocol and the threshold - based protocol .",
    "for example , in order to achieve a qos of @xmath143 at the pu - rx with @xmath144 and @xmath145 , only @xmath146 sus are active on average under the threshold - based protocol . however , the cooperation - based protocol and guard zone protocol can have @xmath147 and @xmath148 active sus , respectively .",
    "this ordering stays the same for the different values of @xmath56 and @xmath39 .",
    "this ordering can be intuitively explained as follows .",
    "the guard zone protocol supports the largest number of active sus because it enables the sus to determine their `` average '' impact on the pu - rx from long - term sensing signal monitoring .",
    "the outage probability is usually caused by the sus that are close to the pu - rx . by forming a proper guard zone region around the pu - rx",
    ", the interference from the nearby sus is avoided and on average more sus are allowed to transmit .",
    "the threshold - based protocol supports the smallest number of active sus due to the effect of uncorrelated fading between sensing and transmitting channels .",
    "for example , the fading on the sensing channel may be severe but the fading on the su transmitting channel may be weak .",
    "thus , the su may receive a weak signal on the sensing channel and decide to transmit , which may generate severe interference for the pu - rx .",
    "the cooperation - based protocol helps to minimize the effect of uncorrelated fading channels by utilizing the local information exchange among sus .",
    "therefore , the cooperation - based protocol allows a higher activation threshold while still meeting the same outage value .",
    "this results in the larger number of active sus , compared to the threshold - based protocol .",
    "although the guard zone protocol supports the largest number of active sus , the implementation of this protocol is only possible in scenarios that allow a long - term sensing signal monitoring before sus can transmit . on the other hand , the threshold - based and cooperation - based protocols only rely on the short - term signal monitoring .",
    "it must be noted that a more comprehensive comparison requires a rigorous study of the tradeoff between performance and implementation complexity in the scenario of interest , which is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a framework to analyze the performance of arbitrarily - shaped underlay cognitive networks with different su activity protocols .",
    "the framework depends on the mgf of the interference due to a random su and allows closed - form computation of the outage probability in the primary network as well as the average number of active sus in the secondary network .",
    "we have also applied cooperation in the context of the underlay cognitive network to come up with a cooperation - based su activity protocol , which includes the existing threshold - based protocol as a special case .",
    "we studied the average number of active sus for the different su activity protocols , subject to a given outage probability constraint at the pu and we used it as an analytical approach to compare the performance of different su activity protocols in the underlay cognitive networks .",
    "our results showed that , in the short - term sensing signal monitoring scenarios , the cooperation - based protocol improves the networks performance compared to the threshold - based protocol .",
    "the proposed framework is especially relevant for emerging ultra - dense small cell deployment scenarios , where network regions can be arbitrarily - shaped .",
    "future work can consider the generalization of cooperation - based protocol with multiple activation thresholds , which is outside the scope of the present work .",
    "it can also analyse the throughput performance of the sus subject to a quality - of - service constraint .",
    "in this appendix , we derive the moment generating function of the interference from a random su and the corresponding @xmath2-th moment for the su activity protocols .    from  ,   and",
    ", we can see that whether a random su generates interference or not is strongly dependent on the su s random distance to the pu - rx , @xmath70 .",
    "the conditional probability mass function ( pmf ) of the interference from a su is given by @xmath149 where @xmath150 represents the conditional probability that a su is active , which is conditioned on its random distance @xmath70 to the pu - rx .",
    "for the guard zone protocol ,   shows that the interference from a random su is given by @xmath155 .",
    "thus , the conditional probability that a su is active can be expressed as @xmath156 substituting   into   and  , the mgf and @xmath2-th moment of the interference from a random su for the guard zone protocol are respectively given by @xmath157 @xmath158 and @xmath159 @xmath160        for the threshold - based protocol ,   shows that the interference from a random su is given by @xmath161 , i.e. , the su generates interference as long as @xmath162 when the distance to pu - rx is given .",
    "thus , the conditional probability that a su is active can be written as @xmath163              for the cooperation - based protocol , consider a typical su node a , cooperating with node b , as shown in fig  [ coop ] .",
    "given the position of node a , let @xmath168 represents the conditional probability that node b leads to node a deciding not to transmit .",
    "this event occurs when node b falls into the cooperative region @xmath169 around the typical user a and the received signal at node b is greater than the activation threshold @xmath47 .",
    "using this fact , we can express @xmath168 as @xmath170 @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the distance from node b to the pu - rx , @xmath173 is the coordinate of node b , @xmath174 represents the fading power distribution on the user b s sensing channel and @xmath175 denotes the integration over the overlap region between @xmath25 and @xmath169 .",
    "we can see from   that @xmath168 is a function of the location of node a. consequently , the integration in   is very complicated to evaluate in closed - form . in order to simplify the analysis",
    ", we assume that :    * the cooperation range @xmath176 is small compared to the size of the cognitive network region ; * the sus within the cooperation range experience the same path - loss ; * the effect from the boundary is neglected so that the overlap region is the same as the cooperative region irrespective of location of node a.      the complement of the probability @xmath168 , denoted by @xmath180 , is known as the probability that node b causes node a to transmit .",
    "in addition to node a , there are a total number of @xmath126 sus which are independently distributed inside the network region .",
    "consequently , the conditional probability that @xmath126 nodes can make node a to be active is @xmath181 , where @xmath168 is given by  .    in order for node",
    "a to transmit , both the received signal powers at the sus inside @xmath169 and the received signal power by node a on the sensing channel must be less than the activation threshold @xmath47 .",
    "since nodes are identically distributed , we can drop the subscript @xmath182 in @xmath179 and b in @xmath183 .",
    "thus , the conditional probability of a random su being active can be expressed as @xmath184 @xmath185    then the mgf and @xmath2-th for the interference from a random su can be obtained by substituting   into   and   respectively , which can be expressed as @xmath186 and @xmath187 hence , we arrive at the results in theorem  [ theorem_coop ] and corollary  [ theorem_coop ] . then the mgf and @xmath2-th for the interference from a random su can be obtained by substituting   into   and   respectively , which can be expressed as   and   shown at the top of next page .            from definition , @xmath139 is the mean value of the number of active sus , after averaging over all possible networking realizations .",
    "let @xmath189 denote the ( unconditional ) probability of a su being active .",
