    "the fermi liquid(fl ) theory has been used to describe metallic phase in which quasi - particle concept develops from a free electron model to study the metallic behavior@xcite . since the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in the cuprates@xcite , the normal state properties of the quasi - two dimensional cuprates have been investigated experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the experimental observations such as optical conductivity@xcite , electrical resistivity@xcite and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy(arpes)@xcite do not follow the conventional fl behaviors .",
    "the absence of those fl dependences has lead to a proposal that fl model for these quasi - low dimensional conductors should be discarded in favor of a luttinger liquid - like model@xcite in which there is a separation of charge and spin degrees of freedom in the elementary excitation .",
    "however castellani , di castro and metzner have shown that the fl regime is recovered for dimensions greater than one , having investigated instability of luttinger liquid(ll ) by analyzing correlated fermions with anisotropic hopping amplitudes in one dimensional system@xcite and dimensional crossover fl to ll using analytic continuation for non - integer dimensions@xcite .",
    "independent calculations show that arbitrarily small transverse hopping kills off ll@xcite .",
    "they also found no breakdown of the perturbation theory .    given that the expected fl dependences are based on parabolic band ( a spherical fermi surface model ) and a quasi - particle approximation and assuming that the ground state is analytically continuous to the non interacting ground state as a function of interaction strength",
    ", the discrepancy between the fl picture and the experiment has two possibilities .",
    "firstly the conventional fl dependences are present but they are limited to anomalously low energy and temperature scales induced by interactions among the fermions or by the band structure of the non - interacting fermions . in this picture the spectral density of the single - particle green s function is still characterized by a single - particle like sharp resonance for momenta very close to the fermi surface whose width becomes progressively broader as the quasi - particle momenta move further from the fermi surface where the quasiparticle approximation breaks down .",
    "the second possibility can be viewed as an extreme case of the first possibility in which interactions are so strong that the quasi - particle approximation breaks down over at least some region of the fermi surface . in this case",
    "the ground state is still a fl in that it has developed analytically out of the non - interacting ground state .",
    "this picture is supported by arpes measurements@xcite on the underdoped cuprates although the quasi - particle peaks remain anomalously broad ever at the chemical potential@xcite . in these experiments",
    "the fermi surface seems to develop around a particular direction , signaled by a quasi - particle peak in the measured spectral density at low doping .",
    "the region in which there is a fermi surface defined by the vanishing of a quasi - particle peak grows with doping until the whole surface is established.@xcite the absence of a quasiparticle peak is referred to as a pseudogap .",
    "previously this type of data for underdoped cuprates had been described in terms of hole pockets which were shown to arise from strong correlation effects in calculations of the t - j model@xcite . however",
    "a search for these pockets in the recent arpes results@xcite was unsuccessful .",
    "the leading 2d fl behavior for on - shell self - energy with an isotropic band structure at zero temperature , @xmath17 , is    @xmath18    @xmath19    where the cut - off energy @xmath20 is isotropic@xcite .",
    "these leading on - shell dependences of imaginary part of self - energy had been determined previously by a number of authors@xcite . for low - density system @xmath20",
    "goes to zero so that the region of the generic fermi liquid behavior is limited .",
    "the @xmath21 energy dependence in the real part is a mirror of the imaginary part of the self - energy , @xmath22 , through kramers - kronig relation which gives a @xmath23 contribution to the specific heat in addition to that from zero sound@xcite .",
    "the @xmath24 term is the leading zero - sound contribution .",
    "this term has a corresponding @xmath25 term in @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , determined by the velocity of the zero - sound mode .",
    "2d calculation shows no evidence of a breakdown in fl theory and is similar to 3d fl considering a parabolic band .",
    "the cut - off energy , @xmath20 , has a corresponding cut - off temperature , @xmath28 , which restricts the leading correction to fl behavior in @xmath29 so that @xmath30 behavior will take over the fl behavior at low density limit@xcite .",
    "these cut - offs are determined by quasiparticle interactions and the characteristic energy of the non - interacting system , @xmath31 . as the system goes to quasi 1d band which can be modeled by considering different ratio of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , for example quasi 1d organic materials such as @xmath34 or @xmath35@xcite , van hove singularity moves to the bottom of the band so that particle - hole(@xmath36 ) pair contribution is more important than particle - particle(@xmath37 ) contribution for low density limit . in this case",
    "the nature of the q1d fl behavior remains similar to that of 2d fl@xcite .",
    "for parabolic band structure @xmath37 channel which leads cooper instability is more important than @xmath36 channel in 3d and vice versa in 1d due to the density of states .",
    "no particular set of diagrams is significant in 2d@xcite , but at least the second order calculation is shared by both of them so that functional dependence in either one will represent the fl behavior . the @xmath37 channel is discussed later in this paper .",
    "the cuprates have an anisotropic band - structure which can lead to strong band structure features in the density of states .",
    "this anisotropy of the band structure is used in a number of different models to explain the lack of fl dependences in experiment@xcite .",
    "the anisotropy has been invoked to describe transport data in the hot spot@xcite and cold spot@xcite models . in the hot spot model",
    "it is proximity to the sdw instability that is important whereas in the cold spot model it is proximity to the superconducting phase through pairing fluctuations which leads to the anisotropy .",
    "more recently renormalization group calculation have shown that if the fermi surface is dominated by a set of saddle points in the density of states landau fl theory , the quasi - particle approximation to fl theory , can breakdown@xcite .",
    "the hubbard model has been employed extensively in theoretical investigations of the normal state properties of the cuprates because the tight binding band structure and short - range coulomb correlations result in an effective magnetic hamiltonian for low doping which is consistent with the data .",
    "we investigate the fl characteristics of this model as a function of chemical potential , @xmath1 , from @xmath38 where the fermi surface is a circle to @xmath39 , near half - filling , where it is almost a square .",
    "a 2d nearest neighbor tight - binding band structure , @xmath0 , will be used to determine the momentum and energy dependence of single properties in fl behavior where t is the nearest neighbor hopping constant . near the half - filling curved @xmath40 points are connected by flat fermi surface which is a good model for the band structure of bscco",
    "in which there is a strongly nested vector@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian includes a repulsive contact interaction which we treat in the weak coupling approximation . by introducing a cut - off , @xmath41 , for the interaction in momentum space the influence of long wavelength interactions on @xmath7 in the @xmath36 channel has been investigated in this model and shown to determine the functional form of @xmath7 at low energies as in the parabolic band case .",
    "the evolution of the leading behaviors in real and imaginary part is determined by the changes in the bare @xmath36 propagator as the fermi surface becomes more anisotropic .",
    "first we calculate the contribution to @xmath42 , the on - shell self - energy , to the second order in @xmath43 which gives the functional form of the corrections and then consider the effect of the repeated scattering from @xmath36 channel which would indicate the influence of any instabilities in these behaviors .",
    "we next calculate the off - shell self - energy , @xmath7 , which is probed directly in angle resolved photoemission through the spectral density @xmath44 .",
    "it is found that energy dependence of the imaginary part of @xmath7 leads to a width of the quasi - particle resonance in @xmath45 which is linear in @xmath15 even when the on - shell @xmath46 has the expected @xmath47 dependence .",
    "we point to the difficulty of extracting the functional form of off - shell self - energy from arpes data on the spectral function .",
    "from the hamiltonian @xmath48 where @xmath15 is the electronic band structure and @xmath43 is the electron - electron interaction which is treated as a perturbation term , the single - particle self - energy , @xmath49 , is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the unperturbed temperature green s function and @xmath52 is bose matsubara frequencies .",
    "the @xmath53 includes all the @xmath36 diagrams in principle . as a function of filling",
    "the electronic band structure develops an anisotropic fermi surface which will end up with quasi - one dimensional square fermi surface at @xmath54 .",
    "as the system goes to half - filling , the density of states at the fermi surface approaches to the van hove singularity , which makes @xmath36 channel more significant in the low filling system .",
    "we are to concentrate on two directions in momentum space through out the calculations , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which are extreme directions in the tight - binding band structure .",

    "unlike the parabolic band structure the anisotropy of the system in the tight - binding band structure restricts the solution of the delta function to different areas of the fermi surface as the chemical potential approaches to half - filling and a direction of the system aligns @xmath72 . for a given @xmath6 ,",
    "the solutions of the delta function come from two different regions of fermi surface",
    ". only one of these contribute for the @xmath73 direction , whereas both of them survive in @xmath74 direction in the long wavelength limit .",
    "on the @xmath36 channel the short wavelengths do not affect the logarithmic behavior in @xmath26 but do contribute to the cut - off energy , @xmath20 . at half - filling with @xmath75 ,",
    "the correlation function diverges in both real and imaginary part which will reflect sdw instability@xcite .",
    "hence by restricting a range of the interaction we tune the cut - off momentum , @xmath41 , in the self - energy calculation to identify the values of @xmath76 which are responsible for fl energy dependence .",
    "first we discuss results of the 2nd order calculation in the next section which will show the fl energy dependences in the function of band structure and we evaluate and discuss the repeated scattering case and stoner instability . except in @xmath77 limit , there is no nesting phenomena from short wave length which solely contribute the cut off energy , @xmath20 without affecting the log behavior .",
    "we consider two different regions of @xmath1 separately as in anisotropic 2d fl and quasi 1d fl .",
    "the self - energy at zero temperature for second order calculation is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the density - density correlation function or response function and @xmath80 in which @xmath81 and @xmath82 throughout the calculations .",
    "the @xmath83 behavior in the imaginary part of the self - energy comes from the linear energy dependence in @xmath84 . in the self - energy calculation",
    "the energy dependence is mainly determined by the frequency dependence of the density - density correlation function rather than the step functions in the expression for the self - energy .",
    "since the second order contribution is common for both of @xmath36 and @xmath37 channel , the second order calculation reveals the functional dependence of fl behavior as a function of chemical potential which we break in two regions , 2d and quasi-1d .",
    "as the chemical potential , @xmath1 , goes to zero , flatness of fermi surface along @xmath56 direction develops .",
    "although the fermi surface develops flat , quasi - one dimensional , regions for @xmath86 , no signature of quasi - one dimensional behavior is seen in @xmath87 .",

    "the cut - off energies , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , associated with the contributions given momentum @xmath92 are from the two different fermi surface contributions through the delta function for a given momentum @xmath93 .",

    "if we expand @xmath45 near @xmath214 which is approximately the location of the resonance peak since @xmath7 is continuous , the width of half maximum is given by the on - shell self - energy @xmath215 showing that there is very little frequency dependence in the real part , @xmath216 .",
    "the figure [ acompare ] shows the agreement between the half maximum width and the on - shell self - energy at low energies , @xmath217 , for @xmath193 and @xmath39 . as in the figure",
    "the generic fl logarithmic behavior is restricted to low energies . for @xmath193 case @xmath204",
    "shows linear behavior in @xmath15 at higher energies which is not extrapolated to zero energy .",
    "clearly the assumption that a deviation from @xmath218 or @xmath106 is an indication of non - fermi liquid is not correct .",
    "we note that no sign of the complicated @xmath15 and @xmath10 dependences of @xmath16 , shown in equation ( 15 ) , comes out of this analysis of arpes data .",
    "it seems to us unlikely that it will be possible to recover these dependences without prior knowledge of the functional form to which to fit the data .",
    "we have demonstrated that anisotropy in band structure does not qualitatively change fl dependencies .",
    "we have done that by calculating single - particle properties in the hubbard model in which the shape of the fermi surface is changed from a circle to a square as the value of the chemical potential is varied from @xmath38 to @xmath39 . in these calculations",
    "we have used a weak coupling approximation in which the magnitude of the interaction , @xmath219 , is far from the values for the sdw instability except for @xmath220 .",
    "numerical coefficients in the functional forms of the imaginary part of the self - energy reflect the anisotropy of the band structure but it is not until the fermi surface is almost a square that the first sign of quasi-1d behavior , @xmath130 , appears . as @xmath77 the magnitude of @xmath26 increases with with increasing anisotropy . also , in the @xmath77 limit , an @xmath6 independent region in @xmath96 grows , which is responsible for @xmath130 behavior in @xmath141 in @xmath55 direction .",
    "the @xmath21 term is also found in @xmath139 as in parabolic band case .",
    "the instability of the system is slowly developed as the system goes to 1d except @xmath99 .",
    "the off - shell self - energy is shown to have a similar @xmath9 and @xmath10 dependence as in the parabolic band with deviations as the fermi surface developes flat regions .",
    "there is no evidence for the pseudogap phenomenon for the parameters used here , @xmath82 and @xmath221 . in this region",
    "we confirmed the half maximum width of the resonance peak for spectral function is approxmated by on - shell self - energy .",
    "asymmetry in the resonance peak grows for @xmath222 due to @xmath223 and for deep inside of fermi surface for @xmath39 and @xmath224 direction . in the tight binding band structure quasi - particle picture",
    "is well defined for @xmath221 and @xmath225 .    as",
    "one goes further away from this parameter region it becomes difficult to justify the simple rpa weak - coupling approximation used here .",
    "sdw and superconducting fluctuations are likely to play a role as other authors have pointed out .",
    "their effects on the leading dependences from long wavelengths in @xmath7 remain to be investigated .",
