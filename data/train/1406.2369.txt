    "the experimental determination of the symmetry of the superconducting gap is important to unravel the mechanism of superconductivity in iron - based superconductors @xcite .",
    "measurements of the london penetration depth @xcite , thermal conductivity @xcite and specific heat @xcite in electron doped ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 ( baco122 ) suggest that the superconducting gap changes significantly with doping , developing nodes at both overdoped and underdoped dome edges @xcite .",
    "this doping evolution is very similar to what is observed in another electron - doped family , nafe@xmath1co@xmath2as @xcite and lifeas @xcite .",
    "it is also consistent with the predicted dependence of the gap function with doping in the @xmath12 model @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "nodal behavior is observed at all doping levels in isovalent- substituted bafe@xmath3(as@xmath1p@xmath2)@xmath3 ( bap122 ) @xcite .",
    "this remarkable contrast in two systems that share the same parent compound prompts a detailed study of the hole doped ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 ( bak122 ) materials .    in bak122 , a full isotropic gap has been reported in compositions close to optimal @xcite , whereas strongly overdoped compositions with @xmath13 display nodal superconductivity @xcite .",
    "although these observations suggest a similar trend as compared to the electron - doped baco122 materials @xcite , there has been no systematic studies of the superconducting gap structure in the underdoped bak122 so far . in this doping regime ,",
    "superconductivity coexists and competes with long - range magnetic / nematic order @xcite , making this an ideal system to investigate the rich interplay between these ordered states @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a sizeable asymmetry between the normal state properties of the electron- and hole - doped materials is observed in such underdoped regime @xcite .        in this work",
    "we study the evolution of the temperature dependence of the in - plane london penetration depth , @xmath0 , in high quality single crystals of ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 across the underdoped region of the phase diagram @xmath14 .",
    "we find that the optimally doped samples show a weak exponential temperature dependence in the @xmath7 limit , suggesting nodeless isotropic gaps .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the temperature dependence of the superfluid density , which can be well fitted using the self - consistent @xmath9-model with two full gaps in the clean limit @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the lowest-@xmath5 samples , deep in the underdoped regime , show a strong power - law temperature dependence of @xmath0 in the low-@xmath15 limit , typical of strongly anisotropic gaps .",
    "the onset of this behavior coincides with the onset of the coexistence between the superconducting and magnetic / nematic phases , indicating that the anisotropic changes in the pairing interaction arising from this coexistence play a major role in determining the gap structure in the underdoped regime . the magnitude of @xmath16 , which serves as a proxy of the magnitude of the zero - temperature penetration depth , shows a rapid rise in the range of coexisting magnetic / nematic order and superconductivity .",
    "comparison with the penetration depth data in the electron - doped counterpart ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 reveals that the rapid rise of @xmath17 in the coexistence state is similar in both materials , as expected for competing electronic ordered states @xcite .",
    "however , the increase in @xmath17 is almost three times larger in electron - doped materials , suggesting that the competition between magnetic / nematic order and superconductivity is weaker in the hole - doped materials .",
    "interestingly , this electron - hole asymmetry inside the superconducting state correlates with the asymmetric behavior of the normal state properties , in particular the nematic susceptibility , as measured by the in - plane resistivity anisotropy @xcite and by elastic constant measurements @xcite , and pseudogap features in the inter - plane resistivity @xcite .",
    "the growth and characterization of single crystals of bak122 used in this study is described in detail in previous reports @xcite . in brief , measurements were performed on pre - screened crystals with sharp superconducting transitions and individually measured chemical compositions with wavelength dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( wds ) in _ jeol jxa-8200 _ electron microprobe . the composition was measured for 12 points per single crystal and averaged , yielding statistical errors of compositional measurement of @xmath180.005 .",
    "the london penetration depth @xmath0 was measured using the tunnel - diode resonator technique @xcite in our he@xmath19 and dilution refrigerator set - ups ; details of the calibration procedure and data analysis can be found in ref .  .",
    "in fig .  [ fig1](a )",
    "we show the variation of the london penetration depth @xmath0 from the base temperature to @xmath5 for five compositions of ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 spanning from @xmath4=0.16 ( @xmath20 k , edge of the superconducting dome ) to @xmath4=0.34 ( @xmath21 k , nearly optimally doped ) .",
    "the data are normalized by @xmath22 and reveal the high quality of our single crystals as evidenced by the sharpness of the superconducting transitions and the absence of any additional features . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) we present the same data plotting the actual @xmath0 as function of the reduced temperature @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "this is the characteristic temperature range in which the superconducting gap of single - band superconductors can be considered constant , and in which the temperature dependence of @xmath0 reflects the nodal structure of the gap . in the clean limit , @xmath0",
    "is expected to depend exponentially on temperature in nearly - isotropic nodeless superconductors , whereas a linear - in-@xmath15 behavior is expected for superconductors with line nodes .",
    "because the experimental verification of the exponential dependence is difficult due to noise in the data , the standard procedure is to fit the data to a power - law function , @xmath25 . in this case , exponents @xmath26 usually indicate nodeless gap , whereas @xmath27 indicate strong gap anisotropies  either due to nodes in the presence of impurity scattering or due to very deep gap minima @xcite . in fig .",

    "is approached , the magnitude of @xmath30 dramatically decreases and the @xmath0 curves progressively flatten at low temperatures .",

    "[ fig3](b ) , as determined from the data analysis for @xmath56 with @xmath55=0.1@xmath5 and @xmath55=0.15@xmath5 , decreases from @xmath51=3.5 for @xmath4=0.34 ( which is technically indistinguishable from an exponential dependence ) to @xmath57 for @xmath4=0.16 .",
    "( ii ) the actual variation of the london penetration depth @xmath54 with @xmath55=0.3@xmath5 and @xmath55=0.15@xmath5  which mimics the doping dependence of the zero - temperature penetration depth  strongly increases in the same doping regime .",
    "both effects are more prominent for doping levels @xmath58 , where magnetism and nematicity are also present .",
    "indeed , these trends can be understood theoretically as a result of the competition and coexistence between magnetic / nematic order and superconductivity .",
    "on the one hand , magnetism competes with superconductivity for the same electronic states @xcite , which is most directly revealed by the suppression of the magnetic order parameter below @xmath5 seen in neutron scattering @xcite . due to its magnetic origin",
    ", nematic order inherits this competition and also competes with superconductivity @xcite , as manifested by the decrease of the orthorhombic distortion ",
    "proportional to the nematic order parameter @xcite ",
    "below @xmath5 , as measured by x - ray scattering @xcite . the competition between these electronic ordered states results in a suppression of the zero - temperature superfluid density , and a consequent enhancement of the penetration depth in the low - temperature limit @xcite , in qualitative agreement with the experimental data .",
    "on the other hand , coexistence with magnetic / nematic order leads to strong anisotropies in the gap function , which is also in qualitative agreement with the experimental data .",
    "consider for instance a simplified scenario in which the @xmath12 gap function and the pairing interaction are completely isotropic at optimal doping . because nematic order breaks the tetragonal symmetry of the system , it gives rise to a d - wave component in the original @xmath12 gap function in the coexistence state @xcite .",
    "due to the proximity between the d - wave and @xmath12 ground state energies  as manifested by the existence of a bardasis - schrieffer mode in the raman spectrum of the optimally doped samples @xcite  this mixing between d - wave and @xmath12 states can be sizeable , leading to strong anisotropies in the gap .",
    "furthermore , long - range magnetic order promotes anisotropy in the pairing interaction itself @xcite . due to the anisotropic reconstruction of the fermi surface caused by the doubling of the unit cell in the magnetic phase ,",
    "the electronic states near the fermi level acquire a significant angular dependence , which is translated to an effectively anisotropic pairing interaction for the states of the reconstructed fermi surface . as a result , the gap nodes that were fully isotropic in the non - coexistence state develop deep minima , which may even give rise to nodal behavior @xcite .",
    "k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 and of the electron - doped ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 .",
    "the data are plotted using normalized @xmath59 composition scale , where @xmath60 is a doping boundary of @xmath61 lines with @xmath60=0.25 for k- and @xmath60=0.063 for co - doping , respectively .",
    "( b ) doping evolution of the temperature - dependent part of london penetration depth @xmath16 in k - doped ( blue circles ) and co - doped ( red triangles ) .",
    "note three times difference in the magnitude of penetration depth increase in two cases .",
    "inset in panel ( b ) shows normalized temperature - dependent resistivity , @xmath62 , for under - doped samples with co - doping @xmath4=0.038 , @xmath59=0.6 and k - doping @xmath4=0.18 , @xmath59=0.72 , plotted using normalized temperature scale , @xmath63 . note that resistivity of k - doped samples shows very small change at @xmath64 , while that of co - doped samples increases significantly below @xmath64 . ]",
    "it is instructive to compare these observations with the results on electron - doped baco122 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we directly compare the doping phase diagrams ( panel ( a ) ) and doping evolutions of the london penetration depth ( panel ( b ) ) of the hole and electron - doped bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 based superconductors .",
    "the data for baco122 were taken from ref .  .",
    "to take into account the fact that the structural ( i.e. nematic ) and magnetic transition lines ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively ) coincide in bak122 , but split with doping in baco122 , we normalized the compositions of the samples to those with the lowest measured structural transition temperatures , @xmath4=0.25 in bak122 and @xmath4=0.063 in baco122 .",
    "this comparison reveals very interesting similarities and differences between these two families .",
    "first , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the @xmath61 boundary in bak122 terminates very sharply , suggesting a possible first order transition with doping between the orthorhombic / nematic and tetragonal phases .",
    "second , the rapid increase of the london penetration depth @xmath54 with underdoping , reflecting the increase of @xmath32 @xcite , has very different magnitudes for the two types of doping .",
    "for instance , despite using bak122 samples that are much closer to the edge of the superconducting dome ( @xmath5=7  k for @xmath4=0.16 ) than in our previous study of baco122 compounds ( @xmath5=7.4  k for @xmath4=0.038 ) @xcite , we find a three times smaller increase of @xmath16 on the hole - doped side compared to the electron - doped side .",
    "this suggests weaker competition between magnetic / nematic order and superconductivity in the hole - doped bak122 than in the electron - doped baco122 , which is in line with the significantly weaker suppression of the magnetic order parameter below @xmath5 found in neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "similarly , as shown in the inset of panel ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the normalized resistivity in the normal state is much less affected by the long - range magnetic order in bak122 than in baco122 .",
    "this suggests that the partial gapping of the fermi surface by long - range magnetic order is stronger in the latter case , leaving less electronic states available for the superconducting state .",
    "we note that the nematic susceptibility is also weaker in the bak122 family , as evidenced by the in - plane resistivity anisotropy behavior @xcite and the softening of the shear modulus @xcite .",
    "therefore , our findings suggest a close relationship between the electron - hole asymmetries of the normal state and superconducting properties . despite displaying different magnitudes , however , the continuous increase of @xmath16 with underdoping in both electron- and hole - doped samples contrasts with the case of isovalent doping , bap122 , in which a sharp peak in the low - temperature penetration depth is observed @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , our measurements of the london penetration depth in high quality single crystals of ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 close to the optimal doping level @xmath4=0.34 ( @xmath21 k ) reveal a superconducting state with two full gaps @xmath66=6.5  mev and @xmath67=3.3 mev . on the other hand ,",
    "our measurements deep in the underdoped regime , for @xmath4=0.16 ( @xmath20 k ) , demonstrate that the gap develops significant anisotropies without , however , developing nodes .",
    "comparison with the electron - doped compositions ba(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 reveals a strong asymmetry of the structure of the superconducting state , which is nodeless in hole - doped and nodal in electron - doped compounds .",
    "these observations suggest that the competition and the coexistence with magnetic / nematic order is responsible for the anisotropic structure of the superconducting gap in the underdoped regime , and that this competition is stronger in electron - doped rather than in hole - doped compounds .",
