    "vector meson photo- and electroproduction have been important tools used to understand the hadronic properties of the photon @xcite . for low values of",
    "the four - momentum transfer squared , the photon interacts with the target predominantly through vector meson intermediate states that diffractively scatter off the target .",
    "this process , shown in fig.@xmath14[fig : diagrams]a , was originally described within the framework of the vector - meson dominance ( vmd ) model .",
    "the production of the @xmath5 meson through this mechanism may be interpreted in terms of the hadronic structure of the photon , that couples to a virtual meson with a strength proportional to the square of the charge of its constituent quarks .",
    "due to the dominant @xmath15 quark component in the @xmath5 meson , quark exchange ( e.g. meson - exchange ) mechanisms and s - channel resonance production are strongly suppressed @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath16 scattering at low four - momentum transfer proceeds primarily through pomeron exchange , similar to hadron - hadron diffractive scattering .",
    "it is generally believed that the underlying mechanism for pomeron exchange is multi - gluon exchange , where the simplest possibility requires at least two gluons since all hadrons are color singlets .",
    "a simplification to these calculations was introduced by donnachie and landshoff @xcite , who proposed a model whereby the pomeron couples to quarks inside the interacting hadrons as shown in fig.@xmath14[fig : diagrams]b . calculations within this context have been applied to @xmath5 electroproduction to study the quark substructure of mesons @xcite and to photoproduction at large momentum transfer @xcite . in these models",

    "quark exchange mechanisms @xcite become significant for the production of vector mesons with valence @xmath19 and @xmath20 quarks , but play a limited role in the production of @xmath5 mesons .",
    "the hadronic structure of the photon arises from fluctuations of the virtual photon into short - lived quark - antiquark ( @xmath21 ) states of mass @xmath22 during a formation time @xcite @xmath23 where -@xmath17 is the squared mass and @xmath24 is the laboratory - frame energy of the virtual photon ( see appendix a for notation ) .",

    "the form factors are related to the charge radii @xmath141 , via @xmath142 for hadron - hadron elastic scattering @xcite , the cross sections depend exponentially on t : @xmath143    comparison of equations [ eq : opt_int_size ] and [ eq : el_int_size ] , and noting that the cross section is proportional to the square of the form factor , leads to a relationship between the radius of interaction , @xmath144 , and the @xmath6-slope parameter @xmath117 : @xmath145 the radius of interaction can be written as @xmath146 where @xmath107 and @xmath139 are the radii of the nucleon and vector meson , respectively .    because of the virtuality of the vector meson , the interaction region should also decrease if the formation distance is less than the size of the nucleon ( c@xmath76 @xmath18 @xmath147 2 fm ) .",
    "a representative sample of the large body of @xmath25 data shown in fig.@xmath14[fig : b_dt_prev ] suggests the following phenomenological parameterization for the @xmath6-slope dependence on @xmath77 : @xmath148 a two - parameter fit to eq.@xmath14[eq : int_size ] , ignoring any explicit dependence of @xmath149 on @xmath17 , yields @xmath150 \\label{eq : rho_taufit } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath151 .",
    "however , eq.@xmath14[eq : int_size ] also has an indirect dependence on @xmath17 through @xmath77 . at fixed @xmath4 , we can write eq.@xmath14[eq : dtau ] as @xmath152 thus , we can plot eq.@xmath14[eq : int_size ] as a function of @xmath17 , using this expression for @xmath77 .",
    "this is shown in fig.@xmath14[fig : b_q2_prev ] for @xmath25 data at the fixed value of @xmath4 = 2.6 gev @xcite .",
