    ", the security of protocol is guaranteed using single photon sent by alice . for a high loss or not a perfect single photon state , hwang proposed a decoy - pulse method to guarantee the security under the photon - number - splitting attack for the bb84[4 ] .",
    "recently , a. rubenok proposed a new quantum - key - distribution protocol that is immune to attack to vulnerabilities of single - photon detectors[5 ] . another celebrated qkd protocol is e91[6 ] , which is based on the quantum entanglement . at same time , using the electromagnetic field amplitudes of  non - classical \" light beams ( squeezed or entangled light ) to qkd also draw much attention [ 7 - 12 ] .",
    "protocol of counterfactual quantum cryptography is proposed [ 13 ] , and its experimental demonstration is reported [ 14 ] .",
    "another protocol of counterfactual quantum cryptography is discussed with tripartite[15 ] .",
    "recently , salih et.al . proposed a protocol to realize direct counterfactual communication ( no need for a prior quantum key distribution)[16 ] based on the previous work[17 ] , which shown how to make an interaction - free measurement[18 - 20 ] .",
    "in[16 ] , the ` chained ' quantum zeno effect and interference of optical paths is used to achieve information transmission between alice and bob without any photon traveling between them , by using a single photon source .",
    "however , in order to have a direct communication , large number of perfect beam splitters ( 8000 pieces for 90% efficiency[16 ] ) and no dissipation in all paths are required . in a real experiment , the bss are finite ( usually less bss is better ) and the dissipation of the paths ( including the bss themselves ) could not be avoided[21 - 23 ] . here",
    "we consider the effect of the dissipation on the direct communication , and analyze how the reliability of the direct communication can be preserved . in sec .",
    "ii , we derive the equations shown the effect of the dissipation by using quantum operators , which is independent of the input states . in sec .",

    "v , we give the conclusion .",
    "consider the setup shown in fig.1(a ) , which is composed with two chains of bss , the inner chain and the outer chain .",
    "the two chains are formed by ( m-1 ) and ( n-1 ) head - tail connected mach - zehnder interferometers ( mzis ) , respectively[13 ] .",
    "alice and bob can use the setup to have information communication with a single photon field ( or a coherent field ) .",
    "the outer chain contains m beam splitters ( bs in green color ) with the same reflectivity @xmath0 with @xmath1 and ( m-1 ) mirrors ( black color in fig.1(a ) ) , which are in the hands of alice .",
    "each inner chain is formed by n bss ( in blue color ) with the same reflectivity of @xmath2 with @xmath3 and 2(n-1 ) mirrors .",
    "the reflectivity of all the mirrors is 100% without the dissipation .",
    "the inner chain ( fig.1(b ) ) has two parts , the bss ( blue color ) and half of its mirrors in the hand of alice and the other half mirrors in the hand of bob . from the blue color bss to the mirrors in bob s hands",
    ", the field needs to pass through the transmission channel , which is publically accessible .",
    "bob can block the paths in his hands with inserting blocks ( small red color rectangles ) .",
    "the two outputs of each inner chain go to the outer chain and detector @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "alice sends out her field , bob can choose to insert his blocks or not in the paths in his side , and alice measures the counting ( or intensities ) received by the two detectors , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "for no dissipation and infinite m and n , when bob inserts his blocks , alice will see @xmath6 click , and when bob does not insert his blocks , alice will find @xmath5 click .",
    "hence , alice will know whether bob inserts the blocks or not .    in real experiment ,",
    "the dissipation of the paths ( including the mirror itself ) could not be avoided . here",
    "we group all the paths in fig.1(a ) into three groups , left ( paths at the left line ) , middle ( paths in the middle line ) and right ( paths in the right line ) .",

    "2 . the reliabilities , @xmath17 for no blocks and @xmath18 for with blocks , which represent how reliable the communication is . for no blocks ,",
    "we want @xmath19 , while for with blocks , we want @xmath20 , so that alice immediately knows that bob inserts ( or does not insert ) his blocks when she sees the click of @xmath6 ( or @xmath5 ) .",
    "the larger @xmath21 and @xmath22 are , the more reliable the communication is .",

    "the answer is yes .",

    "what is the expense ?",
