    "symmetry breaking is a crucial aspect of modern particle physics . in particular the symmetry breaking sectors of theories extending the standard model",
    "are studied intensively .",
    "many of the most puzzling problems in generic standard model extensions , such as the gauge hierarchy and parameter proliferation problems , arise because of the use of elementary scalar fields to spontaneously break symmetries .",
    "deeper insights into both the physics and mathematics of symmetry breaking are thus worth having .",
    "the majority of model building scenarios consider a gauge symmetry @xmath0 which is spontaneously broken to a subgroup @xmath5 .",
    "of special interest here are models where @xmath0 is broken simultaneously to several isomorphic but differently embedded subgroups @xmath5 . below",
    "we enumerate several general classes of models where this mechanism is apparent . in such models ,",
    "each isomorphically embedded subgroup is given by @xmath6 for some @xmath7 , and is identified with a point in the vacuum manifold @xmath3 . for a higgs field in a @xmath0 representation and an associated basis of weights for this representation , we develop explicit mathematical formulas for writing each state in the vacuum manifold as a linear combination of the weights . to make our result accessible to the model - building audience at large , we provide a careful review of the necessary mathematical tools which belong to the discipline of representation theory .",
    "we shall also explain all our mathematical results in the physical context of spontaneous symmetry breaking .    in the adjoint representation",
    "the weights are the roots , and there exists a basis of weights for this adjoint representation which are known as the simple roots .",
    "these can be pulled back to define a cartan subalgebra @xmath8 , consisting of adjoint higgs vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) which cause the symmetry to break along @xmath9 .",
    "our formalism identifies the vacuum manifold @xmath3 which belong to the vector space spanned by the cartan subalgebra .",
    "the elements of the vacuum manifold are related by a weyl group symmetry . given an adjoint higgs vacuum expectation value , @xmath10 , breaking @xmath11 , a full complement of vevs breaking @xmath0 to different cartan preserving embeddings of the subgroup @xmath5 can be obtained through this method .",
    "we give an explicit formula for recovering each vev .    in our treatment , we shall concentrate on a specific and relevant case for high - energy physics model building scenarios , where @xmath5 stabilizes the highest weight of the lowest dimensional fundamental representation .",
    "this case in fact admits the simplest formula for recovering all vevs breaking @xmath11 , when the cartan subalgebra for @xmath5 is a subset of the cartan subalgebra for @xmath0 .",
    "the results presented here may provide direct solutions to problems in high - energy physics research .",
    "this includes problems arising in :    * grand unified theories ( guts ) , where so - called `` flipped '' models arise whenever there are alternative embeddings of a given gut inside a larger gut @xcite . * domain - wall brane scenarios which use the `` clash of symmetries '' mechanism @xcite",
    "this idea was the main motivation for us to pursue the present study.[item : domain - wallbranes ] *   the low - energy limit of yang - mills theory  @xcite.[item : yang - mills ] * whenever there are multiple copies @xmath12 of a given representation of higgs fields , with vevs @xmath13 breaking the gauge group to isomorphic but differently embedded subgroups .",
    "this is a special case of what is generally termed `` vacuum alignment '' .",

    "@xcite , corresponding to contexts ( ii ) and ( iii ) listed above .",
    "it would also be possible to apply these techniques to help identify standard model particles embedded in representations of a grand - unified gauge group @xcite , and to help classify and construct different chains of embeddings in the context of grand unification @xcite .",

    "the simplest example of flipped grand unification is flipped @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the relationship between standard and flipped @xmath15 may be explained using two different embeddings of @xmath16 inside @xmath17 .",
    "call these two subgroups @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "one of these embeddings has been labeled @xmath20 for `` standard '' , and the other @xmath21 for `` flipped '' .",
    "the selection of one as standard is purely a matter of convention ; the important issue is the relationship between the two embeddings .",
    "having decided to call one embedding `` standard '' , the standard weak hypercharge generator is identified as the @xmath22 obtained through @xmath23 . by contrast in the flipped case , the weak hypercharge generator is @xmath24 , which arises from a second embedding of su(5 ) inside so(10 ) ; namely @xmath25 \\times { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{u}(1)}}_{x_f}$ ] , where @xmath26 is a linear combination of @xmath22 and @xmath27 . @xmath28 is not a subgroup of @xmath29 , in fact @xmath24 is a linear combination of @xmath22 and @xmath27 which is linearly independent of @xmath26 .",
    "this concept can be extended through @xmath30 grand unification .",
    "the subgroup chain @xmath31 can be shown to contain three possible candidates for weak hypercharge : standard , flipped , and double - flipped .",
    "standard hypercharge is a generator of @xmath15 .",
    "the flipped choice is a linear combination of standard hypercharge and the @xmath32 generator , while the double - flipped choice also involves an admixture of the generator of @xmath33 . once again , each of these candidate hypercharges is actually a generator of a differently - embedded @xmath15 subgroup within @xmath30 .",
    "this work was primarily motivated by a study of domain - wall topological defects created by an adjoint scalar field @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "in particular we study the case where the lagrangian is invariant under a discrete symmetry , @xmath35 , and a continuous internal symmetry , @xmath0 , but along two distinct antipodal directions the asymptotic configuration of the scalar field breaks @xmath36 down to differently embedded isomorphic copies of @xmath37 .",
    "this construction has a natural manifestation in grand - unified models with gauge group @xmath0 and a single infinite extra dimension . here",
    "the adjoint scalar field interpolates between two vacuum configurations preserving subgroups @xmath5 and @xmath38 ( for some @xmath39 and @xmath7 ) as a function of the extra dimensional co - ordinate , @xmath40 .",
    "the case @xmath41 defines what may be called the standard domain wall or kink @xcite . in this case",
    ", the spontaneous symmetry breaking produces exactly the same unbroken subgroup @xmath5 on opposite sides of the domain wall . at generic values of @xmath40 ,",
    "the configuration is also stabilized by exactly that same @xmath5 , except for a finite number of points where the unbroken subgroup may be instantaneously larger than @xmath5 .",
    "the interesting fact is that for certain @xmath42 , domain - wall solutions can also exist .",
    "this situation has been termed the `` clash of symmetries ( cos ) '' , because now the unbroken subgroups in the `` bulk '' on opposite sides of the domain wall are no longer identical , though they are isomorphic @xcite .",
    "one reason to be interested in cos domain walls is the dynamical localization of massless gauge fields to the domain wall , thus effecting a dimensional reduction from a @xmath43-dimensional gauge theory to a @xmath44-dimensional gauge theory .",
    "the idea , which is an elaboration of an original proposal due to dvali and shifman @xcite , is as follows .",
    "we suppose that the non - abelian factors in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 gauge theories produced on opposite sides of the wall are in confinement phase .",
    "the underlying mechanism for this might , for example , be dual superconductivity .",
    "on the wall , the unbroken subgroup is @xmath45 , which is a subgroup of both @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the idea is that the gauge fields of a certain subgroup of @xmath45 are dynamically localized , due to the mass gap created by the confining dynamics in the bulk .",
    "an example of this situation has been provided in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", @xmath30 breaks to differently embedded @xmath46 subgroups in the bulk on opposite sides of the domain wall . for appropriately chosen pairs of these subgroups ,",
    "their intersection is @xmath47 . by hypothesizing that the @xmath17 gauge forces lead to confinement",
    ", the conclusion is that the @xmath15 gauge fields should be dynamically localized on the wall , the bulk dynamics is governed by a non - renormalisable gauge theory that must be implicitly defined with an ultraviolet cut - off , beyond which new physics must be invoked to complete the dynamics .",
    "studies of yang - mills theory in @xmath48 dimensions at finite lattice spacing , which acts as an ultraviolet cut - off , support the existence of a confinement phase when the gauge coupling constant is above a critical value @xcite . ] .",
    "this is interesting for model building when @xmath49 , because the dynamically - localized @xmath50 @xmath15 gauge theory could form the basis for a phenomenologically - realistic standard model extension .",
    "it is simultaneously possible to localize fermions to a domain - wall brane @xcite , thereby providing all the components for a @xmath51-dimensional grand - unified theory .    to implement the cos mechanism we must solve the euler - lagrange equations for @xmath34 for boundary conditions as @xmath52 breaking @xmath53 to @xmath5 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "therefore it is necessary to understand how the boundary conditions breaking @xmath0 to @xmath6 can be written as a linear combination of the adjoint scalar field vevs breaking @xmath0 along the @xmath55 branching direction in the cartan subalgebra .",
    "solutions to the euler - lagrange equations satisfying different boundary conditions have different energies . a boundary condition preserving a symmetry @xmath5",
    "can be continuously transformed into a boundary condition preserving any other isomorphic subgroup @xmath56 inside @xmath0 , and for some choices of @xmath57 solutions interpolating between the @xmath5- and @xmath58-preserving boundary conditions exist .",
    "the phenomenology of each of these domain - wall solutions is different because each different non - isomorphic intersection @xmath59 will give rise to a different gauge theory localized on the domain wall .",
    "hence an exhaustive search for the lowest energy stable domain - wall configuration must be executed .",
    "this search must range through all solutions to the euler - lagrange equations with different boundary conditions . in this case a systematic method for finding all the different possible configurations must be established . to trap a copy of the standard model gauge group on the domain wall",
    ", the grand - unified gauge group must have a comparatively high rank , for example @xmath30 as in @xcite . for high rank groups a method for writing",
    "one set of boundary conditions in terms of another becomes critical .    to find the vev for the adjoint @xmath34 breaking @xmath0 to a subgroup @xmath6 as a linear combination of vevs along the @xmath60 branching direction in the cartan subalgebra",
    ", the authors of @xcite wrote down the casimir operators ( invariants ) for a general linear combination of the cartan subalgebra , @xmath61 .",
    "the coordinates in the cartan subalgebra space which extremize the casimir operators correspond to linear combinations which break @xmath0 to certain subgroups , including @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the physical reason for this is : invariance of the action under the internal symmetry forces the potential to be a polynomial in the casimir invariants .",
    "therefore extrema of the casimir operators correspond to degenerate minima in the vacuum manifold associated with spontaneous breaking of the internal symmetry @xmath0 to various subgroups , including to differently embedded isomorphic copies of a subgroup @xmath62 . hence the coefficients in the linear combination which extremize the casimir invariants are precisely the components of the adjoint higgs field in the original cartan subalgebra basis which combine to give the @xmath63 generator which spontaneously condenses to break @xmath64 .",
    "this approach is labor intensive , and the techniques to be explained in this paper will improve upon it .",
    "we have found a natural motivation for our work in domain - wall formation due to the breaking of a global symmetry on cosmological scales . at the other end of the spectrum , in low energy effective models for su(3 ) ( and su(2 ) ) pure yang - mills gauge theories , domain walls form due to a breakdown of weyl group symmetry caused by gluon condensation .",
    "this gives rise to a trapping of gauge fields on the domain wall .",
    "galilo and nedelko @xcite work with an effective potential generated by loop order corrections in a low energy effective field theory approach to qcd : @xmath65 where the potential is confining provided @xmath66 , and the non - abelian gauge field strength tensor , @xmath67 , can be written in terms of the su(3 ) lie algebra structure constants @xmath68 as , @xmath69    the second order casimir invariant @xmath70 , causing the minimum of the effective potential to occur at a nonzero gluon field strength .    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is the qcd confinement scale .",
    "galilo and nedelko @xcite look at the effective potential for @xmath73 , which involves restricting the full su(3 ) gauge theory to the @xmath74 abelian subspace , where the generators are given as a linear combination of the diagonal gell - mann matrices , @xmath75 and the associated field strength @xmath76 can be found by using the abelian subalgebra version of ( [ eq : fieldstrength ] ) on @xmath77 .",
    "the minima of the effective potential are located at :    @xmath78    they are related by a discrete weyl group symmetry .",
    "the requirement that qcd remains unbroken despite a nonzero background field strength means the background field must be the average of an ensemble of gauge field configurations with a high degree of disorder and spatial variation of the direction @xmath79 in color - space .",
    "this causes different vacua to be picked out in different spatial regions .",
    "galilo and nedelko @xcite explain that domain - wall configurations are formed by gauge fields interpolating between these vacua . collectively the @xmath80 describe the vevs of an adjoint higgs field which break su(3 ) to @xmath74 . here",
    "they again form the boundary conditions for the domain wall .    in the pure su(2 )",
    "yang - mills theory domain walls form between vacua preserving different embeddings of a @xmath81 symmetry associated with magnetic charge @xcite .    in both the above models",
    "there is an opportunity to trap gauge fields on the domain wall .",
    "this analysis can be generalized to su(n ) pure yang - mills theory where the rank of the algebra will again necessitate a systematic way of identifying all the boundary conditions for the domain walls .",
    "many extensions of the standard model feature multiple copies @xmath82 of higgs multiplets transforming according to a given representation of the gauge group @xmath0 .",
    "in general , their vevs @xmath83 are not aligned in the internal representation space , so each multiplet breaks @xmath0 to a different subgroup , with the net unbroken symmetry being the intersection of all of these individual subgroups .",
    "these subgroups may or may not be all isomorphic , depending on the model and the context .",
    "for the cases where the individual subgroups are indeed isomorphic but differently embedded in the parent group @xmath0 , then our analysis is relevant .",
    "we now clearly outline some of the terminology and notation we use throughout this document . a reader",
    "who is familiar with standard notation in qcd and root systems may choose to skip this section and use it as a reference .",
    "we choose to work exclusively with diagonal cartan subalgebra generators , which can be done without loss of generality because given an arbitrary cartan subalgebra it is always possible to simultaneously diagonalize each member using a similarity transformation within the lie algebra .",
    "if the lie algebra has rank @xmath84 we choose @xmath85 to refer to our basis for the cartan subalgebra .    throughout this document",
    "we physically contextualize our result using qcd and the weak force as examples . to do this we choose explicit representations .",

    "we use a relabeling of the diagonal gell - mann matrices @xmath96 and @xmath97 to define the su(3 ) lie algebra generators @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 associated respectively with @xmath101 .",
    "we also give rather unimaginative names to the lie algebra generators associated with the valence gluons @xmath102 : @xmath103    notice these are precisely the raising and lowering operators of the su(3 ) lie algebra . given a module @xmath104 for the fundamental representation of @xmath105 these ladder operators can be used to raise ( or lower ) the states @xmath106 in this module which are associated with ( can be directly labeled by ) the weights :    @xmath107    extending the su(3 ) example we will refer to the i - spin , v - spin and u - spin directions in color space , which describe the three cartan preserving embeddings of su(2 ) inside su(3 ) .",

    "analogously to the qcd case we consider linear combinations of the weak force gauge bosons @xmath117 , and the corresponding generators @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "we use this notation because + 1 , -1 and 0 are the respective @xmath120 quantum numbers or electric charges of these linear combinations .",
