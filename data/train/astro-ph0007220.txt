    "since groups of galaxies are intermediate in number density between isolated galaxies and rich clusters of galaxies , it is important to investigate their dynamical properties in detail .",
    "recently , the x - ray satellite rosat has been used to investigate the dark matter content of a large number of groups of galaxies because the hot gas probed in soft x - rays is generally believed to be gravitationally bound to the groups ( ponman & bertram 1993 ; ebeling , voges , & bhringer 1994 ; pildis , bregman , & evrard 1995 ; saracco & ciliegi 1995 ; ponman et al .",

    "a few groups such as seyfert s sextet ( hereafter ss ) , show irregular - shaped soft x - ray morphologies ( pildis et al .",
    "the x - ray morphology can provide important information about the dynamical status of groups of galaxies .",
    "another useful method to investigate the dynamical status is to search for a faint optical envelope surrounding a group of galaxies ( nishiura 1998 ) . in this paper , in order to investigate the dynamical status of ss , we present a very deep optical image of this group and compare it with the soft x - ray halo obtained by pildis et al .",

    ", we can still see the faint optical envelope surrounding ss both in the @xmath9 image and in the @xmath10 image .",
    "next , in order to check whether the skirts of the point spread function ( psf ) of the galactic nuclei contaminate the faint optical envelope , we compared the surface brightness profiles of all the galaxies in ss with that of a star in the same frame of ss .",

    "we can not find any contribution of the light of the psf to the faint optical envelope surrounding ss both in the @xmath9 image and in the @xmath10 image . throughout these two checks",
    "we have confirmed that the faint optical envelope is really present around ss .    using the images in figure 1c and figure 2c",

    "the overall morphology of the individual galaxies is consistent with that obtained previously ( sulentic & lorre 1983 ) .",
    "the faint optical envelope shows an irregular shape .",
    "it is likely that this shape is attributed either to recent - past or to on - going galaxy interactions in ss .",
    "if the member galaxies have experienced a number of mutual interaction over a long timescale , the shape of the envelope might reasonably be expected to be rounder .",
    "therefore , the irregular - shaped morphology suggests that ss is in an early phase of dynamical interactions among the member galaxies .",

    "( 1991 ) obtained an h i map of ss and found that the h i emission , whose intensity peak appears at the center of hcg 79d , shows a southern extension from hcg 79d .",
    "they interpreted this as possible evidence for the interaction between hcg 79d and 79b .",
    "it is thus strongly suggested that hcg 79d shows tidal effects from this interaction .",

    "( 1995 ) in figure 7 .",
    "it is shown that the soft x - ray morphology is quite similar to that seen in the optical .",
    "the optical faint envelope is most likely attributed to stars liberated from the member galaxies through past and on - going tidal interactions .",
    "therefore , the morphological similarity between the optical and soft x - ray images implies that the dark matter in ss was originally associated with the individual galaxies and then has been liberated tidally together with the stars .",
    "the total soft x - ray luminosity of ss is given only as an upper limit , @xmath42 ergs s@xmath6 with rosat pspc ( ponman et al . 1996 ; hereafter p96 ) .",
    "on the other hand , using the same data , pildis et al .",

    "using the software xspec , we estimate the soft x - ray luminosity of the extended emission ; @xmath45 ergs s@xmath6 for @xmath46 = 0.5 kev or @xmath47 ergs s@xmath6 for @xmath46 = 1 kev , where the metal abundances are assumed to be 0.3 times solar .",
    "it is difficult to resolve x - ray emission from individual galaxies using the rosat pspc because of the compactness of ss itself , even if the exposure time were long enough .",
    "it is possible that a part of the x - ray emission may be associated with individual member galaxies .",
    "here we also attempt to examine whether or not the soft x - ray emission of ss really arises from hot gas since supernova remnants , low- and high - mass x - ray binaries , and/or active galactic nuclei could also contribute substantially to the soft x - ray emission to some extent if they are present in the member galaxies .",
    "first we estimate the expected soft x - ray luminosities of discrete sources such as x - ray binaries in the individual galaxies @xmath48 .",
    "such soft x - ray luminosities can be estimated using the following empirical @xmath49 - @xmath50 relationship for galaxies where @xmath50 is the absolute blue luminosity .",

    "although hcg 79e is the redshift - discordant galaxy , this galaxy also contributes to the observed soft x - ray luminosity of ss because it lies in a line of sight toward the group .",
    "we obtain an expected total soft x - ray luminosity coming from individual soft x - ray sources in the five galaxies ; @xmath53 ergs s@xmath6 , which is much lower than the observed soft x - ray luminosity of ss .",
    "second , we estimate possible contributions of soft x - ray emission from starburst phenomena in the member galaxies , @xmath54 .",
    "the spectroscopic properties of the member galaxies based on our optical spectra ( figure 4 ) are summarized in table 3 .",
    "our results show that hcg 79a , 79b and 79d have a weak hii nucleus .",

    "an average soft x - ray to optical @xmath55 luminosity ratio is estimated as , @xmath56 ( read et al .",
    "we estimate that the soft x - ray luminosities from an nucleus in hcg 79a , 79b and 79d are @xmath57 , and @xmath58 ergs s@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "thus , we obtain a total soft x - ray luminosity from starbursts in these galaxies , @xmath54 = @xmath59 ergs s@xmath6    the model estimated total soft x - ray luminosity from ss , which is the sum total we have calculated above for the soft x - ray luminosity of the individual galaxies , is @xmath60 ergs s@xmath6 .",

    "finally , we estimate the x - ray luminosity of hot gas trapped by the gravitational potential of ss , @xmath65 .",
    "mulchaey & zabludoff ( 1998 ) find a correlation between soft x - ray luminosity from hot gas within poor clusters @xmath65 and radial velocity dispersion @xmath66 of galaxies in them , @xmath67 using this empirical relation , we obtain @xmath68 ergs s@xmath6 using the observed value @xmath69 km s@xmath6 for ss . this value is a factor of five larger than the observed x - ray luminosity . since the sum total",
    "we calculate for the soft x - ray luminosity of the individual galaxies is high enough to explain the observed x - ray luminosity , it is not necessarily to take account of the mass contribution from the hot gas .",
    "deeper x - ray observations of ss are needed to discuss the nature of the hot gas in ss .      to discuss the dynamical properties of ss",
    ", we first estimate the dynamical mass of the system .",

    "since this mass is 73@xmath114% of the estimated dynamical mass of ss , it would appear that the majority of the dark matter may still be associated with the member galaxies .",
