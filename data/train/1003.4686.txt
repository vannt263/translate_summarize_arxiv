    "quantum gravity seeks for the synthesis of general relativity and quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the synthesis of special relativity and quantum mechanics still also remains to some extent an open problem @xcite it is anticipated that in general the synthesis of relativity and quantum mechanics can also shed new light on the structure and properties of the subatomic world , an area currently treated by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite .    on the other hand the bohr and bohr - sommerfeld rotating electron models of the h atom present striking examples where classical deterministic treatment of a physical problem coupled with the de broglie wavelength expression leads to results in almost quantitative agreement with experiment and with the results of the full quantum mechanical schrdinger treatment . in these very successful classical circular or elliptical orbit models",
    "the centripetal force is the coulombic attraction between the proton and the electron which are both treated as point charges .",
    "it thus becomes interesting to examine the extent to which this deterministic type approach may be useful to provide a satisfactory zeroth order model for other physical problems at the subatomic level such as the condensation of the quark - gluon plasma to form hadrons @xcite .",
    "in such an approach the parton or quark - gluon constituents of hadrons may be viewed as particles with relativistic velocities @xcite .",
    "such an approach appears worthwhile to consider since , as analyzed in several recent papers by t hooft @xcite , attempts to produce physically realistic models for the unification of general or special relativity with quantum mechanics may not be successful unless some level of determinism in the latter is restored @xcite . as shown by t hooft @xcite such models which introduce determinism beneath quantum mechanics and thus restore causality and locality can be constructed so that stochastic behaviour is correctly described by quantum mechanical amplitudes in precise accordance with the copenhagen - bohr - born doctrine @xcite .",
    "a difficulty , however , with such models , which may be essential to restore causality and locality at planckian distance scales @xcite , is to obtain a hamiltonian which is bounded from below and thus leads to a ground state @xcite .",
    "these considerations have provided an incentive for the present work where we present a deterministic model which combines special relativity , newton s gravitational law and the weak equivalence principle to examine the rotational motion of three light neutral or charged particles under the influence of their gravitational attraction with velocities very close to the speed of light @xmath0 .",
    "this leads to an infinity of bound rotational states and , similarly to the bohr model of the h atom , angular momentum quantization is used to select among these states the ones which conform to the de broglie wavelength expression which historically has been the origin of quantum mechanics .",
    "interestingly it is found that when the masses of the light particles are in the mass range of neutrinos @xmath4",
    "@xmath5 @xcite then the masses of the confined composite bound states formed are in the hadrons mass range @xmath6 . both the computed radii , which are in the @xmath1 range , and the estimated magnetic moments are in good agreement with experiment .",
    "the model also provides a good approximation of the mass ratios between the proton and other baryons and also predicts a lower limit for baryon lifetimes @xmath7 which is in agreement with experiment .",
    "this deterministic bohr - type hadronization model involves no unknown parameters and , although the observed very good agreement with experiment could be fortuitous , it appears to be a useful zeroth order model for hadronization .",
    "it is at first quite surprising that this semiclassical deterministic model provides a good fit to experiment by considering gravity between the relativistic particles as the only attractive force .",
    "however , the possibility that gravity may have a significant role at short , femtometer or subfemtometer distances has attracted significant interest for years @xcite and the potential role of special relativity @xcite as well as the feasibility of developing a unified gauge theory of gravitational and strong forces @xcite have been discussed .",
    "of special interest in this area was wheeler s concept of geons ( gravitational - electromagnetic entities ) , i.e. of spherical or toroidal objects made up of electromagnetic waves or neutrinos held together gravitationally @xcite .",
    "geons are classical entities based on general relativity .",
    "small electromagnetic or neutrino geons had been proposed as classical models for elementary particles @xcite .    more commonly the formation of baryons and other hadrons via condensation of smaller particles , i.e. of the gluon - quark plasma is analyzed in the qcd theory @xcite .",
    "this condensation occurs at the transition temperature of qcd which is estimated to be around 150 mev in the kt scale , i.e. it corresponds to a particle energy of about 150 mev @xcite .",
    "the gravitational interaction is usually extremely weak and insignificant when discussing interaction between particles such as those forming baryons . in the model discussed here a baryon",
    "is described in terms of the rotational motion of three symmetrically spaced point particles with rest mass @xmath8 being significantly lower than @xmath9 , the rest mass of the baryon .",
    "these three light point particles form a bound rotational state and are moving at a speed close to the speed of light , @xmath0 .",
    "both their kinetic energy and their inertial mass are significantly enhanced by this high relativitic speed .",
    "the rest mass @xmath9 of the baryon is determined by the total rest plus kinetic energy of the three particles , i.e. @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the lorentz factor . when v approaches @xmath0 the lorentz factor @xmath12 and the inertial mass of the particle , @xmath13 @xcite increase very significantly .",
    "thus the first incentive for the present work has been the observation that according to the equivalence principle between inertial and gravitational mass @xcite , such a high value of the inertial mass implies an equally high value of the gravitational mass and thus , according to newton s gravitational law , a much stronger gravitational attraction than that corresponding to non - relativistic velocities .",
    "such a strong attraction can , as shown by the present model , lead to stable highly relativistic rotational states .    a second incentive has been the observation depicted in fig . 1 and table a1 in appendix a that the masses of the known uncharmed spin ( 1/2 ) and spin ( 3/2 ) baryons @xcite , i.e. of baryons consisting of u , d and s quarks , follow with good approximation , better than 3% , a @xmath14 law where @xmath15 corresponds to the proton or the neutron mass .",
    "this @xmath14 law is reminiscent of the @xmath16 law obeyed by the energy levels of the h atom .    in the model discussed here",
    "the three light particles are assumed to have a spin 1/2 .",
    "they are also allowed to be charged which allows for charged baryons , such as the proton .",
    "however , the coulomb interaction between them is shown to contribute less than 0.1 percent to the composite ( baryon ) mass",
    ". the coulomb interaction seems only to account for small differences between close masses of baryons e.g. between that of the proton and the neutron .",
    ", of the uncharmed baryons , consisting of u , d and s quarks , @xcite with equation , i.e. @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the proton mass.,width=285,height=248 ]      we consider a laboratory frame @xmath19 and an instantaneous inertial frame @xmath20 moving with a particle with an instantaneous velocity @xmath21 relative to frame @xmath19 .",
    "it is worth noting that the instantaneous inertial frame @xmath20 is defined by the vector @xmath21 alone and not by the overall type of motion ( e.g. linear or cyclic ) performed by the particle @xcite .",
    "thus one can assign to the frame @xmath20 and corresponding velocity @xmath21 an inertial particle mass , @xmath22 , by considering a test force , @xmath23 , parallel to @xmath21 , acting on the particle . according to the theory of special relativity the case where @xmath23 and @xmath21 are",
    "parallel is the only case where the force is invariant , i.e. the force perceived in @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the same @xcite .",
    "starting from the general relativistic equation of motion , i.e. from @xcite : @xmath24 and using the fact that the test force @xmath23 is taken to be parallel to @xmath21 one obtains after some simple algebra that the measures of the force , @xmath25 , and of the acceleration , dv / dt , are related via : @xmath26    this defines the mass @xmath13 , termed sometimes longitudinal mass @xcite , which is the inertial mass of the particle , @xmath22 , as it equals the ratio of force and acceleration .",
    "thus it is @xmath27 . according to the equivalence principle",
    ", @xmath22 also equals the gravitational mass , @xmath28 , of the particle @xcite , i.e. : @xmath29    it is worth noting that the equivalence principle has been formulated and tested for parallel @xmath23 and @xmath21 vectors , as is the present case .",
    "it is also worth reminding that , as already noted , for given @xmath8 and v the inertial mass @xmath22 and thus the gravitational mass @xmath28 are both uniquely determined by and their value does not depend on the type of motion ( e.g. linear or circular ) performed by the particle .",
    "thus upon considering a second particle of rest mass @xmath8 and instantaneous velocity measure v relative to the observer at @xmath19 and at a distance @xmath30 from the first particle , it follows that the inertial and gravitational mass of the second particle is also given by @xmath13 , as in equation and thus one can use these two @xmath28 values in newton s gravitational law in order to compute the gravitational force , @xmath31 , between the two particles .",
    "one thus obtains : @xmath32 which depends on the @xmath33 power of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "it is worth remembering that this equation stems directly from special relativity ( eq .",
    "[ eq2n ] ) , the weak equivalence principle ( eq . [ eq3n ] ) and",
    "newton s gravitational law .    in our semi - classical model the three interacting particles composing the baryon ,",
    "are assumed to rotate at the same speed around their center of mass , in a circular orbit of radius @xmath34 , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . for the laboratory observer",
    "the tangential velocity v is close to the speed of light , @xmath0 and the center of mass of the three particles is at rest .",
    "the magnitude of the resulting force acting on each particle is : @xmath35    , in a circle of radius @xmath34 around their center of mass .",
    "they are equally spaced .",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 are two particle attraction forces and @xmath38 is the resultant , radial , force.,width=263,height=332 ]",
    "one may now consider the relativistic equation of motion ( eq . ) for the case of a circular orbit of radius @xmath34 with @xmath39 . since @xmath40 one obtains : @xmath41 and thus upon combining with eq .",
    "one obtains : @xmath42 i.e. , the gravitational force @xmath31 given by acts as the centripetal force for the rotational motion .",
    "it must be noted on the basis of one might be tempted to assign the value @xmath43 , commonly termed transverse mass @xcite , to the inertial and thus gravitational mass of each particle .",
    "however , as already noted the mass @xmath44 , and thus also @xmath28 is uniquely determined for given @xmath8 and @xmath21 , via the colinear to @xmath21 test force @xmath23 , and does not depend on the type of motion ( e.g. linear or circular ) performed by the particle",
    ".    upon utilizing @xmath45 in one obtains : @xmath46 or , equivalently : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the schwarzschild radius of a particle with rest mass @xmath8 .        as shown in figure 3 the function r defined by eq . exhibits a minimum , @xmath49 , at @xmath50 thus v@xmath51",
    "this is the minimum radius for a circular orbit and the corresponding minimum angular momentum is @xmath52 @xmath53 .",
    "this condition is similar to the criteria @xmath54 or @xmath55 found for circular orbits in special relativity @xcite or @xmath56 for the schwarzschild metric in general relativity @xcite with orbits around point masses with @xmath57 potentials .",
    "equation defines two @xmath58 branches ( fig .",
    "3 ) , one corresponding to low @xmath12 values @xmath59 the other corresponding to large @xmath12 values @xmath60 . the first branch corresponds to common gravitational orbits . in this case @xmath12 and thus the velocity @xmath61 decreases with increasing r , e.g. @xmath62 in the non - relativistic case @xmath63 .",
    "the second branch which leads to relativistic velocities defines rotational states where @xmath12 and thus v increase with increasing r. these states with @xmath64 are the states of interest to the present model . for @xmath64 ,",
    "e.g. @xmath65 eq .",
    "reduces to : @xmath66    this equation can be used to eliminate r or @xmath58 in the force expression of eq . .",
    "in the former case ( i.e. elimination of r ) one obtains : @xmath67 and thus , interestingly , for any fixed value of @xmath12 or @xmath34 , the attractive force is uniquely determined by the familiar @xmath68 parameter of the gravitational field equations of general relativity @xcite , i.e. @xmath69 , which relates the einstein tensor @xmath70 with the stress - momentum - energy tensor @xmath71 @xcite .    in the latter case",
    ", i.e. elimination of @xmath58 , one obtains : @xmath72      the force equation refers to circular orbits only and thus defines a certain conservative force , since the work done in moving the particles between two points @xmath73 and @xmath74 , corresponding to two rotational states with radii @xmath73 and @xmath74 , is independent of the path taken .",
    "the force vector is always pointing to the center of rotation and thus a conservative vector field is defined which is the gradient of a scalar potential , denoted @xmath75 .",
    "the latter can be termed gravitational potential energy of the three rotating particles and corresponds to the transfer of the particles from the minimum circular orbit radius @xmath76 to an orbit of radius of interest , @xmath34 . the function @xmath75 is obtained via integration of eq . ,",
    "i.e. , denoting by @xmath77 the dummy variable : @xmath78    thus while the magnitude of the gravitational force acting on the rotating particles increases with decreasing radius , r ( eq . ) , the absolute value @xmath79 of the gravitational potential energy increases with increasing @xmath34 .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent of asymptotic freedom @xcite , i.e. the attractive interaction energy is small at short distances and increases significantly with increasing distance @xmath34 .",
    "since it is @xmath80 , the value of @xmath81 can be estimated from newton s gravitational law and is about @xmath82 @xmath83 , which , as shown in section 3.5 , turns out to be of the order of 0.1 ev .",
    "this is quite negligible in comparison with the rest energies of baryons @xmath84 of interest in this work .",
    "thus , in this scale , @xmath85 is quite close to the zero gravitational potential energy of the three free particles with zero velocity at infinite distance from each other .",
    "therefore when this vacuum state is chosen as the reference gravitational potential energy state @xmath86 then for @xmath87 eq . is written with very good accuracy as : @xmath88 or using eq .",
    ": @xmath89    on the other hand",
    "the kinetic energy , @xmath90 , of the three rotating particles is : @xmath91    thus one may now compute the change in total system energy , @xmath92 , upon formation of the rotational bound state from the three originally free particles . denoting by f and i the final and initial states and by ( re ) the rest energy , one obtains from energy conservation : @xmath93-\\left[(re)_{i}+t_{i}+v_{g , i } \\right]=\\\\ \\nonumber & = & \\left[3m_{o}c^{2}+3(\\gamma -1)m_{o}c^{2}-5\\gamma m_{o}c^{2}\\right]-3m_{o }",
    "c^{2}=\\\\   \\nonumber & = & \\delta t+\\delta v_{g } = -(2\\gamma + 3)m_{o } c^{2 } \\approx -2\\gamma m_{o } c^{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last equality holds for @xmath64 as is the case of interest here .",
    "the same @xmath92 expression is , of course , obtained regardless of the choice of the reference potential energy state .",
    "thus in view of eqs . , , and one can summarize the dependence of @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath92 on @xmath12 and @xmath34 for @xmath96 as : @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99    the negative sign of @xmath92 denotes that the formation of the bound rotational state starting from the three initially free particles happens spontaneously , is exoergic @xmath100 , and the binding energy @xmath101 equals @xmath102 .",
    "the total rest plus kinetic energy of the three rotating particles equals @xmath103 and constitutes at the same time the rest energy of the composite particle formed , i.e. of the rotational bound state . denoting by @xmath104 the rest mass of the composite bound state ,",
    "it is : @xmath105    it is useful to note that in the model the rest mass of the three particles , i.e. @xmath106 , does not change when the bound state is formed .",
    "the transformation of the kinetic energy of the three rotating particles into rest energy of the bound state , is simply due to the change in choice of the boundaries of the system . in the former case ( three individual rotating particles )",
    "the boundaries are geometrically disconnected and encompass each particle individually , in the latter case the system boundary contains all three particles .",
    "thus the formation of the bound rotating state by the three particles provides a simple hadronization mechanism , i.e. generation of rest mass , @xmath104 , starting from an initial rest mass @xmath107 , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) .",
    "it follows from and that : @xmath108    thus the binding energy per light particle is @xmath109 , which for @xmath110 , the proton mass , gives an energy of 208 @xmath111 , not far from the estimated particle energy of 150 @xmath111 at the transition temperature of qcd @xcite .",
    "one may note here that since the potential energy expression does not depend on the number , @xmath112 , of rotating particles but the kinetic energy , t , does , i.e. @xmath113 , it follows from that , according to the model , stable rotational states can not be obtained for @xmath114 since they lead to positive @xmath92 .",

    "finds that the computed composite masses , @xmath104 , are in the @xmath117 range .",
    "we then proceed to identify among the infinity of bound rotational states described by eqs . , and , each corresponding to a different @xmath34 , those rotational states where @xmath34 is an integer multiple of the reduced de broglie wavelength @xmath118 of the light rotating particles .",
    "this can be done by introducing quantization of the angular momentum of the light particles in the form : @xmath119 where the subscript @xmath120 denotes a baryon and indicates that the corresponding @xmath12 , @xmath34 and @xmath121 values satisfy the quantization condition .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath15 corresponds to a proton and thus eq .",
    "yields , for @xmath15 , @xmath122 which equals the reduced de broglie wavelength of the light particle of rest mass @xmath8 moving at a speed @xmath123 and is three times the reduced compton length of the proton , @xmath124 .",
    "the mass @xmath125 is calculated by combining eqs . , and : @xmath126    one notes that @xmath127 is the planck mass , @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "one can then reasonably assume that the ground state @xmath129 corresponds to a proton ( and neutron ) .",

    "so far the model discussed only the mass of the light particles and its effect on the binding forming a neutral composite particle . however",
    ", baryons also possess a spin and many of them also charge .",
    "we therefore allocate to the light particles , in analogy to the quark model @xcite , a charge and spin .",
    "it is assumed that there are two types of light particles , those with charge @xmath162 and those with @xmath163 , where e is the elementary charge .",
    "in addition each light particle is assumed to possess a spin 1/2 . as a result all composite particles have either a total spin 1/2 or 3/2 as is the case for most baryons .",
    "the coulombic forces between charged particles with relativistic velocities have been studied in detail @xcite .",
    "it is well established that coulomb s law correctly gives the force on the test charge for any velocity of the test charge provided the source charge is at rest @xcite . in the simplified geometry of figure 2",
    "the distance between the two particles remains constant , thus in the reference frame of the source charge the test charge is also at rest , thus coulomb s law remains valid without any relativistic corrections .",
    "it is thus possible to estimate the coulomb interaction energy between the rotating particles . in the simplified geometry of figure 2",
    "the total coulomb potential energy for the proton ( charges 2/3 , 2/3 , -1/3 ) vanishes ( since ( 4/9)-(2/9)-(2/9)=0 ) , while for the neutron ( charges -1/3 , -1/3 , 2/3 ) it is negative , i.e. denoting @xmath164 one obtains : @xmath165=-\\frac{(e^{2 } /\\varepsilon ) } { 3\\sqrt{3 } r_{b}}\\ ] ] , i.e. there is an overall attractive coulombic interaction .    upon substituting @xmath166 from eq . for the case of the proton",
    "@xmath129 one obtains : @xmath167 where @xmath168is the fine structure constant .",
    "thus @xmath169 is about three orders of magnitude smaller than the rest energy of the proton .",
    "this justifies the approximation made by neglecting the coulomb interaction .",
    "interestingly as shown in table a2 ( appendix a ) the mass differences in baryons which differ only in the charge value ( e.g. the n , @xmath170 or @xmath171 baryons ) are generally small ( up to 7 @xmath172 ) and the ratio @xmath173 , @xmath174 or @xmath175 is of the order of @xmath176 , similarly to the value of the ratio @xmath177 obtained from eq . .",
    "thus the coulomb interaction could be the origin of this small difference .    if the coulomb interaction is taken into consideration the symmetry of the configuration of fig .",
    "2 is broken as not all three charges are the same .",
    "although the deviation from three - fold symmetry is small , since the coulombic energy is small , and thus one may still use with good accuracy eq . to estimate the attractive interaction between the three particles forming a neutron ,",
    "it is conceivable that this broken symmetry may be related to the relative instability of the neutron ( lifetime 885.7 @xmath178 ) vs the proton ( estimated lifetime @xmath179",
    "it is interesting to compute the magnetic dipole moments , @xmath180 , of these bound rotational states . using the definition of @xmath181 and considering the case @xmath15 ,",

    "obtains : @xmath190 which is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of @xmath191 .",
    "this good agreement seems to imply that the spin contribution of the light particles to the magnetic moment of the rotating state is small and only the spin vector orientation ( parallel or antiparallel to the baryon rotation vector ) is important .",
    "a simple semi - classical model is presented which explores the use of gravitation as the origin of the strong force by examining the rotational motion of three light particles due to their gravitational attaction under relativistic conditions .",
    "the model uses special relativity and the equivalence principle to express the gravitational force by substituting the inertial mass @xmath192 in newton s gravitational law .",

    "the angular momentum is assumed to be quantized with the condition @xmath193 rather than with @xmath194 as in the bohr model for the h atom .",
    "the model provides surprisingly interesting results concerning the masses that follow a @xmath14 law , the binding energies per light particle , and also the radii and the magnetic moments .",
    "it also provides a reasonable lower limit for the baryon lifetimes .",
    "the mass @xmath195 and spin ( 1/2 ) of the light particles , agrees with that of the neutrino @xcite .",
    "interestingly this is consistent with wheeler s concept of neutrino geons @xcite .",
    "if this is the case then some of these hadron forming neutrinos have to be charged ( at least in charged baryons ) .",
    "one may explain their absence in experiment by a high cross section for absorption , e.g. to form neutral neutrinos or hadrons .    as in the standard model ,",
    "the charge allocated to the light particles is @xmath196 and @xmath163 .",
    "the coulomb interaction is typically a factor of @xmath197 smaller than the gravitational one and thus can be as a first step neglected .",
    "it is of the order of the small difference in mass between the proton and the neutron . in the series @xmath198 baryons with n=5 , 7 , 8 and 9 are missing",
    "this raises the possibility that such baryons may exist .",
    "the @xmath199 value for the proton is found to be @xmath200 , which when inserted into eq . enhances the gravitational force by a factor of @xmath201 .",
    "this is consistent with the initial hypothesis that the gravitational energy can be enhanced to the level of @xmath202 .",
    "interestingly it follows from equation that in the case of the proton @xmath129 the inertial and gravitational mass of each rotating particle , @xmath203 , is related to the planck mass , @xmath204 , via a very simple equation , i.e. @xmath205 which provides an interesting direct connection between the planck mass and the present model .",
    "interestingly , in wheeler s geon analysis the minimum mass of a small geon also lies in the planck mass range @xcite .",
    "gravity is generally expected to reach the level of the strong force at energies approaching the planck scale @xmath206 @xcite which is in good agreement with the model results ( eq . ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that when using the inertial or gravitational mass , @xmath203 , in the definition of the compton wavelength , @xmath207 of the particle @xmath208 then one obtains the planck length @xmath209 , but when using the mass corresponding to the total energy of the particles , @xmath210 , then one obtains the proton compton wavelength @xmath211 , which is close to the actual distance between the rotating particles .",
    "another interesting feature of the model is that it is qualitatively consistent with a central experimental observation about the strong force @xcite , i.e. that the normalized angular momentum of practically all hadrons and their excited states is roughly bounded by the square of their mass measured in @xmath212 @xcite .",
    "indeed from and one obtains : @xmath213 which in reasonable qualitative agreement with experiment for small integer @xmath214 values .",
    "it thus appears that deterministic bohr - type models which combine special relativity with the de broglie wavelength equation may provide a useful zeroth order approach to explore some subatomic problems .",
    "the present model suggests that gravity may perhaps provide a mechanism for the binding of light particles , probably neutrinos , to form baryons .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with wheeler s concept of small neutrino geons @xcite .",
    "while the results are interesting they should be examined in light of the assumptions made , i.e. that ( a ) the force of gravitation for relativistic particles can be expressed by eq .",
