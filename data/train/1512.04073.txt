    "the idea that our universe is an element in a vast set of universes , the multiverse , has been argued to be an interesting way to address the cosmological constant problem in the context of string theory @xcite .",
    "of course , this scenario raises many questions . how is the vacuum of our world chosen ?",
    "through anthropic arguments @xcite ?",
    "through quantum cosmology arguments @xcite ? is the string landscape scenario compatible with predictability @xcite ?",
    "do the universes of the multiverse interact @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) ? does the multiverse exhibit collective behavior @xcite ? the multiverse also arises in the context of the so - called many world interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite and in the eternal inflationary model @xcite .",
    "actually , it has been recently proposed that the multiverse of eternal inflation and the many - worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics can be identified , yielding a new view on the measure and measurement problems .",
    "however , it has been argued that a non - linear evolution of observables in the quantum multiverse would be an obstacle for such a description as these non - linearities are expected from quite general arguments @xcite .",
    "in this paper we shall study the process of vacuum decay in the context of an interacting multiverse @xcite .",
    "the consideration of an interacting multiverse entails a new and richer structure for the whole set of universes .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analize the influence of this enriched structure in the process of the vacuum decay of a single universe .",
    "first , we shall consider the wheeler - de witt equation for the wave function of the space - time .",
    "for many cases of interest the space - time is described by a homogeneous and isotropic geometry whose spatial section volumes scale as @xmath0 , where the scale factor @xmath1 is a function of the cosmic time @xmath2 of a given multiverse . in this case the wave function of the universe , @xmath3 , simplifies and it only depends on the values of the scale factor and the matter fields , i.e. @xmath4 , with @xmath5 being a set of scalar fields .",
    "the se can t hus be considered as a field that propagates in the space spanned by the variables @xmath6 .    following the usual prescriptions of quantum mechanics ,",
    "a second quantization procedure can be applied to the field @xmath7 , which can be described in terms of quantum oscillators with their corresponding creation and annihilation operators .",
    "these operators would represent , in an appropriate representation , the creation and annihilation of pieces of the space - time with a given geometry .",
    "this description allows for representing the fluctuations of the space - time in terms of baby universes @xcite , i.e. small particle - like portions of space - time that pop up and branch off from the parent space - time and propagate therein .",
    "similarly , for a super - observer the field @xmath7 can be described in terms of particle - like pieces of space - time that we call universes .",
    "the aim of this work is to examine if a supra - universal structure can influence the properties of a single causally isolated region of the space - time .    whatever the definition of a universe is",
    ", it can be associate to some notion of causal closure , i.e. a region of the space - time manifold where all causally related events are self - contained . in other words , something that may cause or may be caused by any effect on any observed part of the universe should be included as being part of the universe .",
    "thus , although it seems meaningless to consider _ external _ elements of the universe , we shall see that this is not the case .",
    "the classical and local notion of causal closure does not exclude the possibility that non - local interactions among different regions of the space - time may determine some of the global properties of single universes .",
    "in fact , it has already been shown @xcite that the interaction between two or more universes could determine the effective values of the cosmological constant of the universes . despite that , light ray cones and local causal relations and properties within each single universe still obey the usual relations and remain causal .",
    "however , the value of a global property like its the cosmological constant can be affected by the interaction among the universes .",
    "this cosmological picture is then completely different than the one single universe picture .",
    "interactions and collective behaviour might then occur among the universes of the multiverse .",
    "actually , this collective behaviour is fairly general and is at the very heart of quantum theory , which is a non - local theory and within which all the physical elements are fundamentally coupled to their environment and individual properties arise out of a result of some decoherence process .",
    "thus , the true quantum state of the space - time must account for the states of all the universes , if they exist .",
    "the aim of this paper is to examine whether some of these collective processes may have an observable influence on the properties of our universe .",
    "irrespective of the consideration of a multiverse and its implications , it seems therefore interesting to analyze the influence , if any , that different distant regions of the space - time may have on the properties of the observable part of our local universe ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) with a two - fold aim : i ) to analyze whether they might help to solve some of the open questions posed by the latest planck data @xcite , and ii ) to look for distinguishable imprints of other universes in , for instance , the properties of the cosmic microwave brackground ( cmb ) spectrum @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we discuss the hamiltonian quantum cosmology model of an interacting multiverse . in section iii , we consider the bubble formation , that is , the nucleation of universes in a parent space - time and specifically address this nucleation in a setting where the universes are interacting .",
    "finally , in section iv , we present a discussion of our results .",
    "let us consider a simply connected piece of a homogeneous and isotropic space - time manifold endowed with a scalar field @xmath8 that represents the matter content .",
    "more general topologies can also be considered by splitting the whole manifold into simply connected pieces of space - time @xcite , each of which is quantum mechanically described by a wave function @xmath9 that is the solution of the wheeler - dewitt equation @xcite @xmath10 where the scalar field has been rescaled according to ref .",

    "it is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the hubble function .",
    "the frequency @xmath17 has units of mass or , equivalently , units of the inverse of time or length .",
    "we shall consider two contributions to the hubble function , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "the first one is due to the existence of a cosmological constant , @xmath19 , which is assumed to be very small .",
    "the second contribution is due to the potential of the scalar field , @xmath20 .",
    "let us now develop a quantum field theory for the wave function @xmath3 in the curved minisuperspace spanned by @xmath21 with a minisuperspace metric given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 stands for @xmath24 .",
    "the _ line _ element of the minisuperspace metric is therefore @xmath25 the scale factor , @xmath26 , formally plays the role of the time variable and the matter field the role of the spatial variable in the two dimensional lorentzian minisuperspace metric ( [ msm ] ) ( @xmath1 can actually be seen as a time reparametrization ) .",
    "we can now follow the usual procedure of a quantum field theory for the scalar field @xmath27 by considering the following action @xmath28 where the lagrangian density is given , as usual , by @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",

    "we consider that the hamiltonian density , eq . ( [ h02 ] ) , represents the evolution of a set of universes that are interacting to each other , where each internal observer do not see any interaction but only its own hamiltonian density .",
    "we can take into account , for the sake of simplicity , a new representation given in terms of the normal modes by means of the fourier transformation of @xmath3 and @xmath42 @xmath43 the hamiltonian density , eq .",
    "( [ h02 ] ) , becomes @xmath44 the new quantum states oscillate now with a frequency given by @xmath45 this is formally the typical quantum description of a collective system in terms of normal modes .",
    "these represent a collective behaviour in which the wave function can oscillate . for a single mode @xmath46 the oscillation of the wave function @xmath47",
    "is given by the equation @xmath48 which is the effective wheeler - de witt equation of the wave function of the @xmath46-universe in the @xmath49 representation that appears as an isolated , non - interacting universe .",
    "we shall assume that , although we work in this single multiverse wave function formalism , all the results can be decomposed in terms of the previous formalism of individual universes .",
    "the effective value of the potential term of the scalar field in the @xmath50-universe has been modified as a result of the interaction with other universes .",
    "let us notice that eq .",
    "( [ frq02 ] ) can be written as @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 , with @xmath54 let us now analyse the influence of the last term in eq .",

    "we restrict our interest to the regime where the wave function of the @xmath46-universe can be approximately described by the semiclassical wave funtion @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the action of the gravitational part alone with no interaction , that is : @xmath57 where the positive and negative signs in eq .",

    "( [ np ] ) , has no influence upon eq .",
    "( [ sf01 ] ) , so the classical behaviour of the scalar field remains unaltered with respect the usual description .",
    "quantum mechanically , however , the extra term in the potential introduces a modification in the vacuum state that has to be accounted for any vacuum decay process of the universe .",
    "this has a major influence in the process of bubble formation and in the global structure of the space - time .",
    "the quantum interactions among distant regions of the whole space - time manifold can modify the vacuum state of the matter fields .",
    "we have seen that for a chain of interacting universes , where the potential of the scalar field for a normal mode of the wave function of the universe depends on the value @xmath50 of the mode .",
    "different universes may remain in different mode states and observers therein feel their universes to be filled with a scalar field whose vacuum state is different for each mode state .",
    "the universes may then suffer a process of vacuum decay between two different values of their vacua .",
    "the key point for the vacuum decay is the existence of different local minima in the potential of the matter fields .",
    "the minimum of those local minima is called the true vacuum and the remaining are the false vacua . in the late 1970s coleman",
    "has generalized the quantum mechanical tunnelling effect of transition from the  false \" vacuum ( excited state ) into the  true \" vacuum ( ground state ) in field theory @xcite .",
    "subsequently , quantum radiative corrections were introduced @xcite and finally the effect of gravity was considered @xcite .",
    "the issue of adopting a set of consistent boundary conditions for the decay process was examined in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the framework developed by coleman and collaborators , a field in a false vacuum state",
    "can then decay to the state of true vacuum with a probability of occurrence per unit time per unit volume , @xmath66 , given in the semiclassical approximation by @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are two quantities to be determined .",
    "the result is the materialization of a bubble of true vacuum separated by a thin wall from the surrounding false vacuum .",
    "the global picture is then a vast space - time in the false vacuum splattered by bubbles of true vacuum that are continuously forming and expanding until they finally collide , merge and fill the whole space - time .",
    "let us now consider the process of vacuum decay in the context of a theory @xcite with a potential @xmath70 that has two minima , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , with values of their vacuum energy given by @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . the thin wall approximation , that is going to be applied , it is satisfied when @xmath75 hence , a region of the space - time in the false vacuum may decay into the true vacuum by nucleating a bubble of true vacuum within the surrounding false vacuum that rapidly grows and expands when it is energetically favourable .",
    "let us now analyse the same process in the context of the interacting multiverse described in sect .",
    "ii . for a given value of the scale factor ,",
    "the extra term of the potential of the @xmath46-universe is a constant that depends on the value @xmath46 of the normal mode of a given universe . the global effective value of the potential is then given by a set of curves separated by @xmath46 units ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , with @xmath76 .",
    "the global picture presents then a landscape structure with @xmath34 different vacua : @xmath77 false vacua states and a true vacuum state @xmath78 .",
    "we can consider , on one hand , the vacuum decay in a universe as a consequence of the multiverse interaction .",
    "on the other hand , we can also consider a global picture of vacuum in the multiverse and study the vacuum decay into a real vacuum that corresponds to a single universe .",
    "the vacuum decay process follows the description of ref .",
    "however , the process of bubble formation and the global structure of a single universe is now much richer .",
    "it can be envisaged as follows : small baby universes are created from quantum fluctuations of the space - time . at small values of the scale factor (",
    "i.e. values close to the planck scale ) the fluctuations of the scalar field and the effects of the interaction among the universes are dominant , so the newborn universes are expected to remain in normal modes with a high value of @xmath46 . in some universes , the effective value of the potential would be high enough to trigger inflation even if we assume the new limit that is suggested by the most recent planck data @xcite . as the universe expands in the @xmath46-false vacuum , different processes of vacuum decay",
    "are expected to occur generating new bubbles of smaller and smaller false vacua until the bubbles are created in the true vacuum @xmath79 .",
    "ho wever , the process does not stop there .",
    "the quantum fluctuations of the space - time of large regions with false or true vacuum state would supply new baby universes where the process of vacuum decay and bubble formation would take place continuously in a self - contained eternal process .",
    ", which is suggested by the most recent planck data @xcite , the energy supplied by the quantum vacuum state could be large enough to trigger inflation in universes with a high mode state , i.e. @xmath80 , for high values of @xmath46 .",
    "a process of vacuum decay could then occur afterwards.,width=302 ]      for the sake of concreteness , let us consider the scalar field with a quartic potential @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the mass and @xmath83 is the self - coupling of the scalar field .",
    "it has two minima located at @xmath84 , both with the same value of the potential given by @xmath85 .",
    "let us notice that in the case studied by coleman and de luccia the value of the potential at the two different minima differs by a small amount of energy @xmath86 , otherwise the process of vacuum decay would not be possible . in the case under consideration , this condition is not necessary because the process of vacuum decay will take place between the vacuum states of different modes that could correspond to different universes or to a single universe whose vacuums had been modified by the interaction with other universes",

    "afterwards , as the universe decays into lower modes , the effective value of the cosmological constant would be getting smaller and smaller until it would reach the value @xmath114 that would be the currently observed value of the cosmological constant .    another way to obtain a small effective value of the cosmological constant",

    "it would imply that for large values of the mode @xmath46 , at the onset of the universe , the effective value of the cosmological constant would be large enough to trigger inflation .",

    "the conformally coupled masses scalar field can effectively mimic a radiation like field with an energy given by @xmath135 .",

    "the existence of a multiverse where the universes may interact opens up the door to a new scenario with important implications on the global structure of the universes . as a result of the interactions it appears a landscape structure where the universes are created with different effective values of the cosmological constant .",
    "thus , there exist the possibility of quantum tunneling transitions between different universal states giving rise to new bubbles with the corresponding value of their vacuum states .",
    "the interaction between universes and the generation of new bubbles is expected to be dominant only for small length scales of the parent space - time , where quantum effects of the space - time are significant .",
    "however , these newborn bubbles may expand and generate new bubbles in a self - reproducing process .",
    "the vacuum decay between the quantum states of two or more universes is expected to be cut off for large values of their scale factors .",
    "this condition imposes a restriction on the possible values of the coupling function in the interaction scheme presented in this paper .",
    "the possible cases of interest have been analysed and they all would have observable consequences in the global properties of each single universe .",
    "they could explain the very small value of the cosmological constant of our universe .",
    "however , a fine - tunning is always required making the proposal , in this respect , no better than others cosmological scenarios @xcite . in the case",
    "that the coupling function would be a constant , it would appear the existence of a pre - inflationary stage in the evolution of the single universes .",
    "a pre - inflationary stage would have observable implications in the power spectrum of the cmb of the universe @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been claimed that it would fi t some o f the anomalies that most models of inflation present with respect to the latest observational data provided by planck .",
    "the interacting multiverse with a coupling function proportional to @xmath175 provides us with a preinflationary stage of the universe whose departure from de sitter expansion is stronger than the one caused by a radiation dominated preinflationary stage .",
    "this would be a pure quantum effect having no classical analogue so : i ) it might hopefully alliviate the quadrupole anomaly of the cmb and , ii ) it could provide distinguishable predictions of the multiverse that can not be explained by any other known effect .",
    "thus , the model of the multiverse presented in this paper entails distinguishable predictions that can be compared with current observational data being therefore falsifiable leading to implications that have not been considered so far .",
