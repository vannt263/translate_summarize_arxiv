    "polypeptide helices are a key secondary structure motif in a wide range of proteins @xcite .",
    "it is well known that some amino acids ( e.g. , alanine ) exhibit a stronger helix propensity than others @xcite , but the fact that the helical structure is so abundant in proteins is still intriguing . from a thermodynamic point of view , there are at least two possible limits in which helices compete with other structure prototypes . towards high temperature ,",
    "one expects the transition to a random coil @xcite , which should become entropically favored as the temperature increases . towards low temperature , however , helices may themselves compete with other enthalpically stable conformations .",
    "however , in the most interesting regime , namely intermediate , physiological temperatures , stability may be determined by a delicate balance between enthalpy and entropy @xcite .",
    "we here unravel this balance quantitatively for the emergence of helical structure in a particularly well studied series of unsolvated polyalanine based peptides ac - ala@xmath0-lysh@xmath1 , @xmath2=4 - 8 @xcite .",
    "we consider explicitly not just the helical part of conformational space , but actually the much larger , general low - energy conformational space of the peptides , of which helices are a part . in this paper",
    "we show : ( i ) a comprehensive search of the conformational space for ac - ala@xmath0-lysh@xmath1 , @xmath2=4 - 8 ; ( ii ) harmonic free energy calculations for several structural candidates ; ( iii ) outlook on the role of anharmonicities in the potential energy surface ; and ( iv ) a theoretical comparison for longer model peptides , considering only helical motifs , with a different termination , in order to clarify the impact of lys on the soft vibrational modes .",
    "our key finding is that there is a significant vibrational entropic stabilization of helices compared to other , more compact conformers , a contribution that should indeed make a difference in actual proteins as well .",
    "this contribution is intrinsic to the helix and should therefore act largely independently , not entangled with environment - dependent terms such as a solvent entropy .",
    "interestingly , an essential role of low - frequency modes is also actively debated in other areas of protein science , related to their function .",
    "beginning with the terms that shape the potential - energy surface ( pes ) , known reasons for helix stability include @xcite ( i ) their efficient hydrogen - bond ( h - bond ) network and increasing h - bond cooperativity with helix length @xcite , ( ii ) suitably bonded and/or electrostatically favorable termination , for instance the lysh@xmath1 termination considered here @xcite , and ( iii ) remarkably , a rather specific favorable contribution of van der waals ( vdw ) interactions for @xmath3-helices @xcite .",
    "clearly , the peptide chain length plays a role : too short chains have too few and too weak hydrogen bonds for helices to compensate the cost of strain in the backbone . in practice",
    ", environment effects will necessarily influence helix stability @xcite . in an aqueous medium ,",
    "the hydrophobic effect will be prominent @xcite . in water - poor conditions , like membranes , helices are frequently observed @xcite . finally , in vacuum conditions , the longer members ( @xmath48 ) of the polyalanine based peptide series studied here assume helical structure in experiment @xcite .",
    "these helices are stable _ in vacuo _ even up to extreme temperatures ( not expected in solution ) @xcite , or after soft landing on a surface @xcite .",
    "the potential energy surface also shapes entropy , and thus the effect of temperature @xmath5 . with increasing @xmath5 ,",
    "the conformational entropy of the backbone will favor an unfolded state @xcite ( so - called `` random coil '' ) , while at low @xmath5 helices may also compete with other , enthalpically more stable conformers .",
    "for instance , gas - phase ion mobility spectrometry ( ims ) by jarrold and coworkers @xcite showed that the ac - ala@xmath6-gly@xmath7-ala@xmath6h@xmath1 polypeptide is helical at @xmath5=400 k but globular at room temperature .",
    "a similar structural change was observed in experiments involving multiply protonated polyalanine in the gas - phase in ref .",
    "@xcite . empirical force - field based simulations by ma and coworkers @xcite of more than 60 small peptides indicate that the _ vibrational _ entropy ( harmonic approximation ) could stabilize @xmath3-helices or @xmath8-hairpins over competing low - temperature conformers .",
    "very recently , plowright and coworkers @xcite used density - functional theory ( dft ) including dispersion contributions ( the b97-d @xcite exchange - correlation functional ) to suggest that , for a small neutral four - residue peptide , @xmath8-sheets and conformers containing 3@xmath9 helical loops are stabilized by the harmonic vibrational entropy at finite temperatures .    in the present work ,",
    "we provide independent , unambiguous , and quantitative computational evidence that the vibrational entropy acts to stabilize helical conformers with increasing temperature over more compact , enthalpically competitive structures .",
    "the reason , in short , is traced to the softer low - frequency modes of helices , which are also reflected in the dynamics ( anharmonic case ) .",
    "we focus on polyalanine - based peptides , since alanine is known to have a high helix propensity both in solution @xcite and _ in vacuo _ @xcite . for ac - ala@xmath0-lysh@xmath1 ( @xmath2=4 - 20 ) in the gas phase , ims @xcite and first - principles calculations",
    "compared to experimental vibrational spectroscopy at room temperature @xcite suggest a cross - over from non - helical to helical preferred conformers as a function of polyalanine chain length .",
    "for @xmath2=5 there is a competition between different conformers , while the @xmath2=10 and @xmath2=15 conformers are found to be firmly in the helical range @xcite . in a previous publication",
    "@xcite we have quantified , from first principles , the contributions from electrostatics , h - bond cooperativity , and van der waals interactions on the stability of unsolvated polylalanine - based helices against unfolding .",
    "this class of systems is thus an ideal testing ground to clarify the structural competition of non - helical ( compact ) and helical conformers as a function of chain length also toward the opposite temperature limit ( low temperature , folded state ) . in the following , we address conformational preference of ac - ala@xmath0-lysh@xmath1 _ in vacuo",
    "_ for @xmath2=4 - 8 , i.e. , the length range in which the helical preference at room temperature develops .",
    "our work is based on an exhaustive prediction of low - energy conformers using dft and the pbe @xcite exchange - correlation functional , corrected to account for long - range vdw interactions @xcite ( here called pbe+vdw ) .",
    "this level of theory treats accurately , and without system - specific empirical parameters , critical length - dependent contributions such as h - bond cooperativity @xcite and vdw interactions @xcite , including their effect on vibrational frequencies and in _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics .",
    "our conformational search strategy , used to find structure candidates of ac - ala@xmath0lysh@xmath1 , @xmath2=4 - 8 , consists of two steps . for a detailed discussion of the search strategy we use here ,",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite . both the lys residue and the c - terminal cooh",
    "are considered protonated throughout , as is known to be the gas - phase preference when the n - terminus is capped.@xcite    in the first step , we begin by an extensive , unconstrained force field ( opls - aa @xcite ) basin - hopping search ( using the tinker package @xcite ) , aiming to simply `` list '' as many different conformers as possible . the same strategy was employed in ref .",
    "@xcite , enumerating a huge number of candidate structures : at least 10@xmath10 conformers for each of the molecules in question .",
    "our particular choice of the opls - aa force field is not motivated by any other reason than that an input structure `` generator '' for dft was needed .",
    "in particular , care was taken that small changes to the parameters in the opls - aa part of the search do not affect the structure manifold considered in the dft step below.@xcite    in the second step , a wide range of conformers suggested by the force field is fully relaxed using dft with the pbe+vdw exchange - correlation functional in all - electron total energy calculations ( fhi - aims program package @xcite ) .",
    "we employ essentially converged numeric atom - centered basis sets and other numerical settings @xcite for the relaxations . in detail , the pbe+vdw part of our searches covers 1068 , 1000 , 800 , 800 , and 820 conformers for @xmath2=4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , respectively . for @xmath2=6 , 7 , and 8 , these numbers are chosen to ensure that at least all conformers identified in the lowest 7 kcal / mol ( @xmath11 0.3 ev ) of the force field step are included in the pbe+vdw relaxations . for @xmath2=4 and 5 , we explored the limits of our search strategy @xcite .",
    "when comparing locally relaxed minima in pbe+vdw that were obtained by starting from an opls - aa local pes minimum structure , we observe a correlation of the relative energy hierarchies , but with a large scatter ( max . around 50 mev per residue ) .",
    "therefore , a large number of conformers must be considered for post - relaxation in pbe+vdw .",
    "the comparison also reveals structure - specific force field errors that might otherwise go unnoticed .",
    "for example , we observe that opls - aa systematically overestimates the energy of 3@xmath9-helical structures _ in vacuo_. to exclude any unwanted impact of the overestimation of 3@xmath9-helices , we performed additional constrained basin - hopping searches in which we forced certain h - bonds of the molecule to remain 3@xmath9-helical , again followed by individual , unconstrained pbe+vdw relaxations .",
    "the pbe+vdw relaxed conformers were sorted into `` families '' according to their h - bond pattern .",
    "we define an h - bond to be present when an o acceptor atom is closer than 2.5  to a h donor atom . within each h - bond family",
    "thus defined , small conformational variations are still possible , e.g. , by slight bends of the backbone atoms or different rotamers of the lysh@xmath1 side chain . typically , the lowest - energy pbe+vdw conformer is found among the family members arising within 5 kcal / mol ( 0.2 ev ) of the lowest - energy force field conformer .",
    "harmonic vibrational frequencies and intensities were computed from finite differences .",
    "the accuracy of the vibrational frequencies calculated in this manner is estimated by analyzing the rotational and translational modes .",
    "these modes should be at zero frequency , and thus the deviation observed gives a limit for the accuracy of the rest of the frequencies .",
    "we have not observed deviations of more than 2 @xmath12 in any calculations .",
    "harmonic free energies were calculated in the harmonic oscillator / rigid body approximation .",
    "vibrational density of states beyond the harmonic approximation were calculated from the fourier transform of the velocity time autocorrelation function , taken from _",
    "ab initio _ molecular dynamics trajectories .",
    "for all molecules containing @xmath2>8 alanine residues and for the li@xmath1 terminated model structures discussed in this work , no extensive conformational search was performed .",
    "these peptides are structure models used specifically for a computer experiment to determine the development of low - frequency vibrational modes with increasing helix length for two different terminations .",
    "their geometries are fully relaxed pbe+vdw structures .",
    "for additional details about these calculations we refer the reader to the supporting information .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] summarizes the energetic ordering of the lowest - energy ( pbe+vdw ) h - bond families for @xmath2=48 , found employing our search strategy .",
    "only the energy of the lowest energy structure belonging to each family is reported , and families are included up to 0.12 ev ( @xmath11 3 kcal / mol ) of the lowest identified minimum of the pbe+vdw pes .",
    "@xmath3-helical conformers are highlighted in red .",
    "the 3@xmath9-helical conformer for @xmath2=4 is highlighted in blue .",
    "we define purely @xmath3- ( or purely 3@xmath9- ) helical conformers as those where , counting from the n - terminus , all the backbone co groups at residues @xmath13 are either connected to nh groups at residues @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) or to the lysh@xmath1 side chain ( usually the final three or four co groups at the c terminus ) .",
    "coordinates and a more detailed analysis of all the geometries shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] are given in the supporting information .",
    "the conformer associated with the lowest - energy pes minimum for @xmath2=4 is rather small , connecting almost all its backbone co groups to the lysh@xmath1 termination .",
    "the remaining h - bond at the n - terminus is bifurcated , comprising an @xmath3- and a 3@xmath9-helical h - bond .",
    "this conformer could therefore be classified as the smallest possible @xmath3-helical prototype in this series .",
    "in contrast , the lowest - energy pes minima for @xmath2=5 and 6 are _ not _ simple helices .",
    "each contains an `` inverted '' h - bond where one co group points to the n - terminus and its connecting nh group points to the c - terminus , producing more compact structures . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , these bonds are highlighted in yellow and pointed to by an arrow .",

    "thus , we already observe a cross - over with peptide length to @xmath3-helical lowest - energy minima of the pes at @xmath2=7 .",
    "however , based on the energy hierarchies of the structures of the local pes minima alone , one would not expect a purely helical ensemble of conformers at room temperature at @xmath2=7 or 8 .",
    "simple boltzmann factors would indicate a mix of structure candidates . yet",
    ", the experimental work by kohtani and jarrold @xcite does indicate a complete room - temperature structural cross - over at @xmath2=8 at the latest , albeit based on a completely different line of reasoning ( water adsorption behavior of `` helical '' versus `` globular '' conformers ) .    for the low - energy conformers in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , we also compute and show in the same figure the impact of the vibrational free energy at room temperature ( @xmath5=300  k ) in the harmonic approximation .",
    "remarkably , the relative stability of the @xmath3-helices is systematically enhanced by the vibrational free energy contribution for _ all _ @xmath2 . for @xmath2=5 and 6",
    "the @xmath3-helical conformers move down in energy with respect to the ( non - helical ) lowest energy pes minimum . for @xmath2=7 and 8",
    "the @xmath3-helices now become the isolated minima . in detail , we observe : + - for @xmath2=8 , the energetic interval between the @xmath3-helical lowest energy conformer and the nearest globular one ( red shaded areas ) now amounts to 0.14 ev .",
    "the additional family 1a at 0.13 ev is another @xmath3-helix with a slightly modified terminating h - bond network . with the vibrational free energy included , the energy hierarchy is thus consistent with the experimental claim that @xmath3-helices dominate over all other possible conformers in gas - phase experiments for @xmath2=8 @xcite .",
    "+ - for @xmath2=7 , the same qualitative picture emerges . here , the next remaining conformer ( family 3 ) at 300  k is a mixed 3@xmath9/@xmath3-helix . the competing compact conformers",
    "( representatives of family 2 and 2a ) are significantly destabilized by @xmath16(@xmath5 ) .",
    "+ - for @xmath2=6 , the @xmath3-helix emerges as the room - temperature minimum free energy conformer , but the competing non - helical pes minimum , family 1 , remains close ( 50 mev ) .",
    "+ - for @xmath2=5 , the difference between the @xmath3-helix and family 1 ( g-1 ) decreases by 60 mev at 300  k , compared to the pes minimum , but family 1 remains overall more favorable .",
    "+ in essence , there is an uniform stabilization of helical over more compact ( globular ) structures as the temperature increases .",
    "the stabilization tendency increases with peptide length , confirming quantitatively and systematically from first principles the related observations in refs .",

    "in summary , we show from first principles , quantitatively , and for a particularly well studied series of polyalanine peptides how helices emerge with length and temperature as the leading structural pattern from a vast array of possible competing conformers .",
    "the crossover to helical stability with length is already apparent based on local structural minima of the potential - energy surface alone , due to the critical role of h - bond networks including their cooperativity @xcite as well as that of vdw terms @xcite .",
    "in addition , the contribution from softer low - frequency vibrational modes acts to stabilize helices with increasing temperature over their more compact competition .",
    "the specific experimental claim @xcite of exclusively helical conformers at and above @xmath2=8 is thus explained by _ both _ enthalpic and entropic effects acting together at finite temperature . _",
    "ab initio _ molecular dynamics simulations corresponding to approximately room temperature suggest that these trends are further strengthened by anharmonic effects .",
    "the emergence of room - temperature helix stability with length in ac - ala@xmath0-lysh@xmath1 is thus the result of a subtle balance of enthalpic and entropic terms . in a non - vacuum environment , further terms",
    "would obviously contribute , but we expect the fact that helices , in general , allow locally softer vibrational modes to hold . regarding the overall ubiquity of the helical motif in folded peptides and proteins , at least , we here show that low - frequency modes will be a significant quantitative contribution .",

    "<S> helices are a key folding motif in protein structure . </S>",
    "<S> the question which factors determine helix stability for a given polypeptide or protein is an ongoing challenge . </S>",
    "<S> here we use van der waals corrected density - functional theory to address a part of this question in a bottom - up approach . we show how intrinsic helical structure is stabilized with length and temperature for a series of experimentally well studied unsolvated alanine based polypeptides , ac - ala@xmath0-lysh@xmath1 . by exploring extensively the conformational space of these molecules </S>",
    "<S> , we find that helices emerge as the preferred structure in the length range @xmath2=4 - 8 not just due to enthalpic factors ( hydrogen bonds and their cooperativity , van der waals dispersion interactions , electrostatics ) , but importantly also by a vibrational entropic stabilization over competing conformers at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the stabilization is shown to be due to softer low - frequency vibrational modes in helical conformers than in more compact ones . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is corroborated by including anharmonic effects explicitly through _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics , and generalized by testing different terminations and considering larger helical peptide models . </S>"
