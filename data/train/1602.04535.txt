    "amorphous solids ( glasses ) , which are known to have non - crystalline structure like fluids , possess solid - like behaviors strikingly different from crystalline solids such as saturation@xcite , universality of internal friction@xcite , linear heat capacity@xcite etc .. one of these properties is called avalanche phenomena , in which the glass stress - strain curve presents a steep drop to a lower value at certain critical external strain . to explain these universal properties , anderson , halperin and varma@xcite group and phillips@xcite",
    "independently proposed a phenomenological model known as tunneling - two - level - system ( ttls ) .",
    "it not only explained several of existing experimental observations , but also predict new phenomena such as phonon echo@xcite .",
    "however , at least to the author s knowledge , there was no direct explaination to the mechanical avalanche problem in glass according to the original ttls model papers@xcite .",
    "the glass mechanical avalanche phenomena is referred to a broad distribution of irreversible ( inelastic ) stress drops in non - quantum , amorphous materials undergoing quasi - static external strain@xcite .",
    "one of the experiments on the glass fracture behavior was in silica glasses and polymers@xcite at room temperatures . based on two - dimensional molecular dynamics simulations , m. l. falk and j. s. langer@xcite developed shear - transformation - zone ( stz ) model to explain low - temperature shear deformations in metallic glasses .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop a microscopic field theory model , namely the generic coupled block model , to investigate the mechanical avalanche phenomena in three - dimensional insulating glass .",

    "consider an external static strain @xmath1 .",
    "the amorphous material will provide a corresponding stress response @xmath2 . since we want to prove the  existence of steep stress drops in stress - strain relation \" , it is more convenient to prove the  existence of positive - negative transitions in glass mechanical susceptibility - strain relation \" , where the glass mechanical susceptibility is defined as the derivative of stress with respect to strain : @xmath3",
    ". therefore , the main purpose of this paper is actually to investigate the  existence of positive - negative transitions in glass mechanical susceptibility @xmath4 \" when external strain exceeds certain critical values , @xmath5 .",
    "the reader should be aware that it is the first time to apply our  generic coupled block model \" in glass mechanical avalanche problems .",
    "therefore our purpose is not to solve the entire avalanche problems from microscopic point of view ; instead we want to provide some first - step results for future people to continue studying this problem from our model .",
    "the set up of our model begins from the generalization of tunneling - two - level - system ( ttls ) model to generic multiple - level - system ( mls ) model .",
    "similar as ttls model , phonon strain field could couple to multiple - level - systems ( mlss ) . as the coupling with phonon strain field , multiple - level - systems ( mlss ) must generate a mutual rkky - type interaction@xcite due to virtual phonon exchange process . finally , our glass hamiltonian is the summation of long - wavelength phonon contribution , a set of mlss , the coupling between mls and phonon strain field , and the mutual rkky - type interaction between mlss .",
    "since we do not take conducting electrons into consideration , the model only applys for insulating glasses .",
    "further considerations regarding conducting electron hamiltonian , electron - phonon coupling and electron - mls coupling are required to explore the ductility of metallic glass .",

    "the effective starting microscopic length scale is of order @xmath6 , corresponding to the characteristic thermal phonon wavelength with the temperature of order @xmath7k .",
    "since the thermal phonon wavelength can be no smaller than the starting microscopic length scale , our theory is only valid below 60k .",
    "we will discuss the reasoning in details in section 3 .",

    "we hope more glass avalanche experiments could be taken below 60k to test the validity of our model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we first generalize glass two - level - system model to multiple - level - system model .",
    "then we give a detailed derivation of our generic coupled block model by introducing the mutual rkky - type interaction between multiple - level - systems .",
    "we introduce the most important concept of this paper , namely non - elastic stress - stress susceptibility at the end of section 2(a ) . in section 3",
    "we treat rkky - type interaction as a perturbation , to set up the relation between small and large length scale non - elastic stress - stress susceptibilities . by repeating such recursion relation",
    ", we eventually carry out non - elastic stress - stress susceptibility at macroscopic length scale . in section 4",
