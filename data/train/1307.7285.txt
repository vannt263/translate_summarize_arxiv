    "the tremendous progress in the field of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) with solid - state superconducting circuits  @xcite has recently triggered massive efforts aiming at the investigation of propagating quantum microwaves  @xcite . towards this end ,",
    "the analysis of propagating microwave light at frequencies of a few gigahertz and with power levels below a single photon on average has become an important task .",
    "however , due to the low signal energy of typically only a few attowatt per megahertz bandwidth , the measurement of such signals requires amplification . for a long time , phase - insensitive high electron mobility transistor ( hemt ) amplifiers are considered as a good choice .",
    "they feature a broad operation bandwidth , high gain , but still add 10 - 20 noise photons  @xcite to the signal .",
    "this noise can be significantly reduced by using josephson parametric amplifiers ( jpa )  @xcite , which achieve amplification via a high - frequency modulation of a josephson inductance . in the phase - insensitive or non - degenerate operation mode ,",
    "the jpa noise temperatures approach the standard quantum limit dictated by the heisenberg uncertainty relation  @xcite .",
    "even better , jpas can in principle amplify a single signal quadrature without adding any noise  @xcite .",
    "this property is intimately connected to the fact that a jpa can squeeze a single quadrature below the level of the vacuum fluctuations .",
    "hence , in combination with lately developed state reconstruction methods for propagating quantum microwaves  @xcite , a jpa is the ideal tool to study the rich physics of squeezed microwave states .",
    "recently , the squeezed vacuum generated by the jpa investigated in this work was successfully used to generate distributable path entanglement  @xcite .",
    "in addition , squeezing is considered as a key ingredient for the creation of quantum memories for entangled continuous - variable states@xcite .    here",
    ", we present a comprehensive study on the squeezing physics produced by a flux - driven jpa  @xcite . the particular advantage of this design is the large isolation between the pump and signal ports .",
    "for this reason , the elimination of the pump tone becomes obsolete  @xcite and , thus , experimental complexity is greatly reduced . after characterizing the basic properties of our jpa with a spectroscopy setup and a standard homodyne detection scheme , we reconstruct the wigner functions of the jpa output states using dual - path cross - correlation techniques  @xcite .",
    "the latter allows us to investigate squeezed vacuum , squeezed thermal and squeezed coherent states .",
    "we find a maximum squeezing of @xmath1 and confirm that the dependence of photon number and displacement on the squeezed and coherent state angle follow the expectations from theory .",
    "in addition , a detailed noise analysis shows that our jpa is operated near the quantum limit in the phase - insensitive mode and that its noise temperature is below the standard quantum limit in the degenerate mode .",
    "all in all , our work illuminates in unprecedented detail the fundamental physics of single - mode squeezing in the microwave domain .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ section_jpa_characterization ] , we discuss the characterization of the flux - driven jpa using spectroscopy and homodyne detection . after introducing sample and measurement setups ,",
    "we analyze signal and idler gain , the associated bandwidths , compression effects , and the noise properties in non - degenerate mode .",
    "next , we investigate in section  [ section_squeezing ] the squeezing of vacuum and thermal states with both homodyne detection and the dual - path state reconstruction method . in section  [ section_squeezed_coherence ] ,",
    "we extend our discussion to squeezed coherent states by operating the jpa in the degenerate mode with coherent input signals . after discussing the jpa noise properties in the degenerate mode based on dual - path measurements in section  [ section_noise ] ,",
    "we summarize our main results and give a short outlook in section  [ section_conslusions ] .",
    "in this subsection , we describe the operation principle of a flux - driven jpa in general and our sample in particular .",
    "a parametric amplifier is an oscillator whose resonant frequency is modulated periodically in time . in the case of the jpa ,",
    "the oscillating system is a quarter - wavelength transmission line resonator whose resonant frequency is determined by its capacitance and inductance ( see figure  [ fig : operation principle](a ) ) .",
    "the latter can be varied by a dc superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) , which consists of a superconducting loop interrupted by two josephson junctions and acts as a flux - dependent non - linear inductor .",
    "thus , by modifying the magnetic flux @xmath2 threading the squid loop , the resonant frequency can be adjusted ( see figure  [ fig : operation principle](b ) ) . by fitting a physical model to the experimental data ( black squares )",
    ", we can estimate a josephson coupling energy @xmath3 for each junction , where @xmath4 is the planck constant .",
    "the slightly different values compared to those in the supplementary material of  @xcite result from the fact that , here , we employ a more sophisticated distributed - element model  @xcite instead of a simple lumped - element approach .    periodically varying the resonant frequency with an ac flux ( pump tone ) at @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the operation point frequency , results in parametric amplification :",
    "a signal at @xmath7 impinging at the signal port is amplified by the signal gain @xmath8 and reflected back out of the signal port . at the same time , an idler mode at @xmath9 is created , whose amplitude is determined by the intermodulation gain @xmath10 .",
    "this operation principle is depicted in figure  [ fig : operation principle](c ) .",
    "if the incoming signal consists of vacuum fluctuations , this process is the analogue of parametric downconversion in optics , where a pump photon is split into a signal and an idler photon .",
    "therefore , strong quantum correlations between the signal and idler mode are established which finally result in squeezing .",
    "an optical micrograph of the sample is shown in figure  [ fig : sample ] .",
    "the resonator and antenna are patterned from a sputtered @xmath11 thick nb film . at the contacts , @xmath12 of gold",
    "is deposited on top of a @xmath13 titanium bonding layer . as substrate",
    "we use thermally oxidized ( @xmath14 ) silicon with a thickness of @xmath15 . in the last step ,",
    "the aluminum dc squid is fabricated using shadow evaporation  @xcite .",
    "each al electrode has a thickness of @xmath11 .",
    "the sample chip is placed between two alumina printed circuit boards inside a gold - plated copper box .      the spectroscopy setup used to characterize the jpa and the homodyne setup to detect squeezing",
    "are sketched in figure  [ fig : setup ] . in jpa characterization and homodyne measurements , the same cryogenic setup ( see figure  [ fig : setup](a ) ) is used .",
    "the sample is anchored to the sample stage of a dilution refrigerator and its temperature ranges between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the signal , generated either by a microwave source or a vector network analyzer ( vna ) , passes a series of warm ( -40 to -@xmath18 ) and cold attenuators ( @xmath19 ) as shown in figure  [ fig : setup](a ) .",
    "the signal power levels stated in this work are referred to the output of the 30-attenuator in figure  [ fig : setup](a ) , while the pump power level is estimated at the input of the jpa sample box .",
    "the transmission from the @xmath20-attenuator output to the spectrum analyzer has been determined by sweeping the temperature of the @xmath20-attenuator and measuring the power of the emitted black body microwave radiation  @xcite .",
    "we subtract this value from the total transmission between the microwave source output and the spectrum analyzer to calibrate for the loss of the input line . for signal and idler gain measurements",
    ", a coherent signal is fed through the attenuated input line via the measurement circulator to the jpa .",
    "this circulator separates the outgoing from the incoming signal and protects the jpa from the noise generated by the amplification chain .",
    "the amplified output signal can be detected by a vna or a spectrum analyzer ( see figure  [ fig : setup](b ) ) .",
    "the vna allows to investigate the complex reflection coefficient of the jpa .",
    "the spectrum analyzer is used to investigate the idler gain and the degenerate operation of the jpa ( see subsection  [ sec : degenerate gain ] ) . figure  [ fig : setup](c )",
    "shows the homodyne receiver used in the squeezing measurements presented in section  [ section_squeezing ] .",
    "it consists of a local oscillator microwave source and a mixer which downconverts the signal and idler modes onto the same intermediate frequency ( if ) .",
    "the resulting interference reveals the strong correlations established between the idler and signal modes .",
    "if the interference is destructive , fluctuations can be squeezed below the level of the vacuum fluctuations .      the first step in characterizing",
    "the jpa is to determine a suitable operating point . to this end",
    ", we measure the signal gain with a vna while synchronously sweeping the pump tone , fulfilling the relation @xmath21 .",
    "since the vna measurement bandwidth of @xmath22 is much smaller than @xmath23 , only the signal mode is detected preventing interference effects present in the degenerate mode .",
    "we emphasize that this measurement is different from the signal bandwidth measurements discussed in subsection  [ subsection_the bandwidth ] , where the pump tone is at a fixed frequency and only the signal frequency is swept . in figure",
    "[ fig : operation point ] , we have plotted the measured signal gain when synchronously sweeping the pump and signal frequency for different flux values . for lower frequencies , the signal gain is increasing because the dependence of the resonant frequency on the flux becomes steeper ( see also figure  [ fig : operation principle](b ) ) .",
    "we choose our operating point @xmath6 between @xmath24 and @xmath25 , depending on the measurement .",
    "as it can be seen from figure  [ fig : operation point ] , our operation point is located in the center of a region where the signal gain is appreciable and its frequency dependence is well behaved . at this operation frequency , the external quality factor is measured as @xmath26 , and the isolation between antenna and resonator is at least @xmath27 .",
    "when the signal frequency is detuned from half the pump frequency , signal and idler modes are at different frequencies and can be observed individually .",
    "this mode of operation is therefore called `` non - degenerate mode '' .",
    "figure  [ fig : gain pump power ] shows the pump power dependence of the non - degenerate signal and idler gain for a detuning of @xmath23 . for low pump power , no significant signal gain is observed and the idler gain is small . for large pump power , the two curves converge and both idler and signal gain reach @xmath28 .",
    "besides the gain properties described above , bandwidth is an important feature of an amplifier .",
    "therefore , we determine the instantaneous bandwidth of signal and idler modes at a fixed operation point ( constant flux and pump frequency ) by measuring the signal and idler gain for various detuning between half the pump frequency @xmath29 and the signal frequency @xmath30 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : bandwidth pump ] , we observe a signal and idler bandwidth of @xmath31 for a pump power of @xmath32 .",
    "we define the gain - bandwidth - product ( gbp ) , which is defined as the product of the voltage gain in linear units and the bandwidth of our amplifier . in the large gain limit ,",
    "the gbp is nearly constant and close to the theoretical limit of @xmath33  @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : bandwidth pump](c ) ) .",
    "going to low values of the signal gain , the idler gain vanishes and the signal gain approaches one because the signal gain is normalized to the pump - off condition .",
    "therefore , we expect the idler gbp to decrease and signal gbp to increase .",
    "however , in the low gain limit the signal bandwidth measurement is very sensitive to the calibration data and fluctuations . consequently , the signal gbp does not diverge in contrast to expectations from theory .",
    "another important figure of merit for amplifiers is their @xmath34-compression point .",
    "it denotes the power where the signal gain is @xmath34 below the value expected for a perfectly linear device  @xcite . in other words , at some point the signal gain starts to decrease as a function of input power due to the nonlinearity of the amplifier . in figure  [ fig : compression](a ) bandwidth measurements of the signal gain are displayed .",
    "in contrast to figure  [ fig : bandwidth pump ] , here the pump power is fixed at -39@xmath35 and the dependence on the signal power is studied . for small signal powers ( @xmath36 )",
    "the curves overlap meaning that the gain is constant and that the amplifier is in the linear regime . for larger signal powers",
    "a reduction of the gain is observed .",
    "figure  [ fig : compression](b ) shows the maxima of the signal gain of figure  [ fig : compression](a ) for several signal powers .",
    "the @xmath34-compression point occurs at @xmath37 .",
    "an analogous analysis for the idler gain ( data not shown ) reveals that the compression occurs for both the idler and signal gain at the same input power . for a circuit qed experiment with a cavity decay rate of @xmath38 , this power level is equivalent to 10 photons on average .",
    "a low noise temperature of an amplifier is very important when using it for measuring signals at the quantum level . here",
    ", we use the spectroscopy setup for a rough characterization of the noise properties of our jpa when it is operated in the phase - insensitive mode . for details on the noise temperature in the degenerate mode",
    ", we refer to section  [ section_noise ] . in order to determine the jpa noise properties , we measure the amplified noise power emitted by the @xmath20-attenuator",
    ", whose temperature is controlled in the range @xmath39 .",
    "the total noise power @xmath40 at the spectrum analyzer is given by @xmath41 + k_{\\rm b}t_{\\rm total}\\right\\ } , \\label{eq : boseplanck}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 denotes the total gain , @xmath42 the detection bandwidth , @xmath43j@xmath44s the planck constant , @xmath45 the boltzmann constant and @xmath46 the total noise temperature of the complete detection chain , which includes the measurement circulator , the jpa and the amplification chain .",
    "@xmath46 is related to the number of photons @xmath47 added by the complete detection chain by @xmath48 .",
    "the first term in ( [ eq : boseplanck ] ) describes thermal fluctuations and vacuum fluctuations according to  @xcite .",
    "possible deviations between the electronic temperature of the attenuator and the measured temperature are taken into account by @xmath49 .",
    "we set the signal gain to @xmath50 at the operation point @xmath6 .",
    "however , sample heating due to the pumping process and compression effects at high noise source temperatures may cause the signal gain to deviate from this value . therefore",
    ", we measure the dependence of the gain - corrected power on the noise source temperature @xmath51 ( see figure  [ fig : noise temperature ] ) . to this end , we implement the following protocol for each temperature point : after measuring the signal gain with the vna , we turn off the vna and measure the total noise power using a spectrum analyzer .",
    "we obtain the gain corrected power by dividing the total noise power at each temperature point by the effective jpa gain for white uncorrelated noise , @xmath52 . here",
    ", we consider the idler gain using @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "taking into account the cable and connector losses between the noise source and the measurement circulator , we estimate @xmath54 , which corresponds to @xmath55 for the noise photons added by the whole detection chain referred to the input of the measurement circulator . this value is close to the standard quantum limit for phase - insensitive amplifiers of 0.5 photons ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "in addition , we find @xmath57 to be reasonably small .      in order to demonstrate the usability of our jpa as a phase - dependent amplifier",
    ", we investigate the degenerate gain . in this mode of operation , the pump frequency is twice the signal frequency .",
    "thus , the idler mode is created at the frequency of the amplified signal mode .",
    "this results in an interference of the two modes which is constructive or destructive depending on the phase between the idler and the signal modes , which can be controlled by shifting the phase difference between the probe signal and the pump tone .",
    "the degenerate gain is measured with a spectrum analyzer , where a measurement with zero pump power is used as a reference . in figure  [ fig : degenerate gain ] , the degenerate gain is plotted as a function of the phase between the probe signal and the pump for different pump power levels .",
    "we observe a maximum degenerate gain of @xmath58 and a maximum deamplification of @xmath59 .",
    "the former value is consistent with the signal and idler gain of @xmath28 ( see sec .",
    "[ subsection_the nondegenerate gain ] ) , since the constructive interference of equal amplitudes results in a @xmath60 increase of gain .",
    "[ sec : degenerate gain ]",
    "as mentioned in the discussion of the operation principle ( subsection  [ subsection_sample ] ) , the jpa creates quantum correlations between the signal and idler modes . in the degenerate operation mode",
    ", these correlations result in deamplification or amplification depending on the quadrature direction . in the case of deamplification",
    ", the quadrature fluctuations can be squeezed below those of the vacuum . in this section ,",
    "we investigate squeezed vacuum fluctuations generated by the flux - driven jpa with two different detection techniques : homodyne detection and dual - path state reconstruction  @xcite .    to define the squeezing level @xmath61 in decibel",
    ", we compare the variance of the squeezed quadrature @xmath62 with the quadrature variance of vacuum fluctuations , obtaining @xmath63\\}.\\ ] ] we note that @xmath64 indicates squeezing and @xmath61 is positive .",
    "larger @xmath61 corresponds to a higher squeezing level .",
    "@xmath65 indicates no squeezing and @xmath61 equals zero .",
    "hence , in this work we use the nomenclature that the term `` squeezing '' is equivalent to `` squeezing below the vacuum level '' .",
    "first , we detect the output signal of the jpa with the homodyne detector shown in figure  [ fig : setup](c ) . by sweeping the temperature of the @xmath20-attenuator from @xmath66 to @xmath67 with inactive jpa",
    ", we calibrate the gain and the noise temperature of the detection chain using ( [ eq : boseplanck ] ) .",
    "then , we cool the attenuator to @xmath68 and investigate the squeezed vacuum state . in figure",
    "[ fig : squeezing](a ) , the ratio @xmath69 is plotted as a function of the relative phase between the pump and the local oscillator and the detected intermediate frequency @xmath70 .",
    "the latter is obtained by downconverting the signal using a fixed local oscillator frequency @xmath71 . for these settings , signals at @xmath72 and @xmath73 , representing the signal and idler modes ,",
    "are downconverted to the same intermediate frequency @xmath70 . therefore , the homodyne detector is sensitive to the correlations between the two modes created by the jpa . here , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the power spectral densities recorded with the jpa pump power on and off , respectively . in figure",
    "[ fig : squeezing](b ) , the average @xmath76 of @xmath77 calculated in the frequency range @xmath78 is plotted . whenever @xmath79 , the noise detected at the spectrum analyzer referred to the input of the amplification chain",
    "is smaller than the vacuum noise emitted by the attenuator .",
    "this demonstrates the effect of vacuum squeezing . from the minimal value @xmath80 indicated in the inset of figure  [ fig : squeezing](b ) , we calculate the squeezing level  @xcite @xmath81.\\ ] ] here , @xmath82 is the noise temperature of the detection chain with the jpa off . taking into account the cable losses , reference spectrum fluctuation and thermal population at the input of the jpa , we retrieve a lower bound of @xmath83 of squeezing at the input of the amplification chain .",
    "the estimation of the squeezing level with the homodyne detection setup only yields a lower bound for the amount of squeezing . rather than improving this setup , we choose to fully reconstruct the squeezed state emitted by the jpa with the dual - path setup , which is based on cross - correlation techniques and realtime data processing  @xcite .",
    "first , we introduce the dual - path setup in figure  [ fig : dp setup ] .",
    "we split the signal under study described by the bosonic annihilation and creation operators @xmath84 and @xmath85 using a microwave beam splitter and feed them into two amplification and detection paths . during the splitting process vacuum fluctuations",
    "are added to the split signals .",
    "while the signal is emitted from our jpa sample , the vacuum fluctuations are realized by terminating the other input port of the beam splitter with a broadband @xmath86 load . at the two output ports , we first amplify the signals using cold hemt and room temperature amplifiers and",
    "then downconvert them to an intermediate frequency ( if ) of @xmath87 using iq - mixers .",
    "the resulting orthogonal quadrature signals @xmath88 and @xmath89 are then digitized by four analog - digital - converters ( adcs ) , and processed in real time by a field programmable gate array ( fpga ) logic . based on the beam splitter relations and the fact that the noise contributions from two detection paths are independent , we get access to all quadrature moments of signal and the two detection paths up to fourth order . in the setup",
    ", we still have the same temperature - controllable @xmath20-attenuator at the end of the jpa input line to calibrate the photon number conversion factors which relate the autocorrelations measured in our detector ( in units of @xmath90 ) to photon numbers at the input of the beam splitter .",
    "after post - processing the ensemble averages of the noisy quadrature moments , the reconstructed signal and noise moments have the form of @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath93 and @xmath94 represent annihilation and creation operators of the noise mode in the detection path 1 and path 2 , and @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 @xmath99 , with @xmath100 and @xmath101 . following  @xcite , with the third and fourth moments we calculate the third and fourth order cumulants to verify the gaussianity of the state .",
    "furthermore , we use the first two moments to reconstruct the signal wigner functions at the input of the beam splitter . at the same time , the noise moments of the two detection paths are obtained .",
    "we find that the detection chains add @xmath102 and @xmath103 photons referred to the beam splitter input which corresponds noise temperatures of @xmath104 and @xmath105 for the detection path 1 and path 2 , respectively .",
    "again , the error bars we provide are of purely statistical nature . in all dual - path experiments ,",
    "the temperature of the jpa sample is stabilized at @xmath66 .      selected wigner",
    "function reconstructions of the state at the input of the beam splitter are plotted in figure  [ fig : wigner ] . when the @xmath20-attenuator is stabilized at @xmath66 ,",
    "vacuum fluctuations are present at the input of the jpa .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : wigner](a ) , the increase in pump power , which corresponds to an increase of signal gain , causes an increase of the squeezing level and an increase of the photon number ( see also figure  [ fig : sqdb](a ) ) .",
    "we achieve a maximum squeezing level of @xmath1 below vacuum at @xmath0 signal gain .",
    "however , if we further increase the signal gain , the squeezing level decreases again . this behavior is expected  @xcite because the squeezing becomes suppressed when the jpa enters the bifurcation regime . in this regime ,",
    "also the higher order cumulants do not vanish anymore .",
    "indeed , we observe this effect in our data for signal gains larger than @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , from the jpa input output relation  @xcite we identify the signal voltage gain in the non - degenerate mode in linear units as @xmath106 . applying this relation ,",
    "we obtain from the photon number of a squeezed state , @xmath107 , the expression @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the signal power gain in linear units .",
    "therefore , we expect that the photon number increases linearly with @xmath110 in the non - degenerate mode with a slope of one .",
    "figure  [ fig : sqdb](b ) confirms this behavior for small signal gains below the bifurcation regime .",
    "next , we fix the signal gain at @xmath34 .",
    "when the temperature of the @xmath20-attenuator is increased ( see figure  [ fig : wigner](b ) and figure  [ fig : sqdb](c ) ) , more and more thermal photons are incident at the input port of the jpa . thus the squeezing level decreases and at some point the output state of the jpa is not squeezed below vacuum any more .",

    "in addition to the squeezed vacuum and squeezed thermal states discussed in the previous section , we here analyze a more general squeezed state : the squeezed coherent state .",
    "there are two ways to obtain a squeezed coherent state .",
    "first , one can squeeze the vacuum state @xmath111 and apply a displacement operation @xmath112 . here , @xmath113 denotes the complex squeeze parameter @xmath114 with squeeze factor @xmath97 and squeezing angle @xmath115 .",
    "second , one can apply a displacement operator on the vacuum state @xmath116 , and subsequently squeeze this displaced vacuum @xmath117 .",
    "we define the coherent phase @xmath118 as the angle between displacement direction and @xmath119-axis , and the anti - squeezed angle @xmath120 as the angle between the anti - squeezed quadrature and the @xmath119-axis .",
    "we illustrate the difference of the two methods in figure  [ fig : squeezed coherent theory ] . for the former method ,",
    "the final displacement of the squeezed coherent state only depends on the displacement operation and is independent of the squeeze factor @xmath97 ( figures  [ fig : squeezed coherent theory](a)(c ) )",
    ". however , the displacement of the squeezed coherent state obtained from the second method depends on both the displacement and squeezing operations . when the anti - squeezed quadrature is parallel to the displacement direction of a coherent state , the final displacement of the squeezed coherent state is maximum ( figure  [ fig : squeezed coherent theory](d ) ) .",
    "contrary , the final displacement reaches its minimal value when the anti - squeezed quadrature is perpendicular to the displacement direction ( figure  [ fig : squeezed coherent theory](e ) ) . in this section",
    ", we present an analysis on squeezed coherent states generated with the second method and detected with the dual - path setup . to this end , we pump the jpa in the presence of a weak coherent signal .",
    "one measurement trace always records four regions : vacuum ( v ) region with both jpa pump and coherent signal off , coherent signal ( c ) region with jpa pump off and coherent signal on , squeezed coherent ( sc ) region with both jpa pump and coherent signal on , and squeezed vacuum ( sv ) region with jpa pump on and coherent signal off .",
    "figure  [ fig : timetrace ] shows typical averaged time traces of selected first and second moments from a single measurement , which corresponds to the situation in figure  [ fig : squeezed coherent theory](f ) .",
    "four wigner function reconstructions are placed on top of the time trace . when both jpa pump and coherent signal are off , we can clearly identify the vacuum wigner function with its maximum centered at the origin .",
    "once we turn on the coherent signal , which is a displacement operation , the vacuum state is equally displaced along @xmath119- and @xmath121-quadratures and becomes a coherent state with phase @xmath122 referred to the beam splitter input .",
    "next , keeping the coherent signal on , we turn on the jpa pump which gives a squeezing operation with the @xmath119-quadrature as the squeezed quadrature and the @xmath121-quadrature as the anti - squeezed quadrature ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "this results in a suppression of the displacement of the state along the @xmath119-quadrature and a corresponding amplification of the displacement along the @xmath121-quadrature .",
    "also the @xmath119-quadrature variance is squeezed and the @xmath121-quadrature variance is amplified , turning the circular profile of the vacuum and coherent state wigner function into an elliptic profile .",
    "thus , the state becomes a squeezed coherent state with squeezing level @xmath61@xmath124 .",
    "finally , keeping the pump on , we turn off the coherent signal to generate a squeezed vacuum state with squeezing level @xmath61@xmath125 . in this context , we would like to point to the following experimental aspect . compared with a coherent state , whose phase @xmath126 is referred to the beam splitter input , in the case of a squeezed coherent state , we use @xmath118 as the phase of the coherent state before applying the squeezing operator , and @xmath118 is referred to the jpa input . during the propagation of the coherent state from the input of the jpa to the input of the beam splitter ,",

    "similar to the center of the wigner function , which represents the displacement , the photon number of a squeezed coherent state varies when we rotate the phase of the coherent signal @xmath126 while keeping the anti - squeezed angle @xmath128 constant . following  @xcite",
    ", we obtain : @xmath139 where @xmath140 describes the thermal photons present in the vacuum state at the jpa input and @xmath141 is the number of photons in the coherent state .",
    "as we see from figure  [ fig : nphoton ] , the photon number oscillates and reaches a maximum when @xmath137 , @xmath138 .",
    "thus , the photon number is maximal when the displacement of the sc state is maximal .",
    "we emphasize that the various states detected in our experiments are referred to the input of the beam splitter .",
    "to fit to theory , we need to shift the reference plane of the coherent state from the beam splitter input with phase @xmath126 to the jpa input with phase @xmath118 . fitting the experimental data , we retrieve @xmath142 and a squeezing factor @xmath143 .",
    "this @xmath97 value is quite close to the value @xmath144 measured for the individual states .    from theory",
    ", we expect that the only difference between a sc state and the corresponding sv state is a displacement in phase space without any rotation or deformation .",
    "therefore , we analyze the statistics of the variances @xmath145 and @xmath62 of the anti - squeezed and squeezed quadratures and that of the angle @xmath128 for the sc and sv states . as displayed in table  [ table : scandsvcompare ] , our data show that no significant rotations or deformations are present .",
    "lccc @xmath42 & @xmath146 & @xmath147 & @xmath148 + @xmath145 & 0.43&@xmath149 & @xmath150 + @xmath62 & 0.015 & @xmath151 & @xmath152 + @xmath128 & 0.87 &  & ",
    "a jpa operated in the degenerate mode can not only generate vacuum squeezing , it can also be used as a low - noise phase - sensitive amplifier which , in principle , does not need to add any noise to the amplified quadrature@xcite . with the dual - path setup",
    ", we therefore study the noise properties of our jpa in the degenerate mode .",
    "more precisely , we perform a temperature sweep of the 30-attenuator shown in figure  [ fig : dp setup ] . the variance of the fluctuations at the frequency @xmath6 generated with this procedure is @xmath153 where @xmath154 has the unit of photon number . at each temperature",
    ", the jpa pump is operated in the pulsed mode .",
    "consequently , a single time trace in our measurement always contains a region corresponding to a non - squeezed thermal state and a region corresponding to a squeezed thermal state . for any quadrature",
    ", the variance @xmath155 at the output of the jpa is related to the variance @xmath156 at the input via the relation  @xcite @xmath157 here , @xmath158 is the gain for this quadrature and @xmath159 is the noise added by the amplifier referred to the output . in principle",
    ", we could determine the variance of the thermal state at the input of the jpa using the dual - path reconstructed signal moments at the input of the beam splitter taking into account the cable , circulator and jpa losses .",
    "however , the dual - path reconstruction detects a thermal population of 0.1 photons in the vacuum  @xcite which would result in a significant underestimation of the jpa noise . for this reason",
    ", we calculate @xmath160 based on  ( [ eq : noise ] ) , and model the cable loss between the @xmath20-attenuator output and the measurement circulator input with beam splitters , and account for the temperature gradients . in this way , we model an equivalent amplifier consisting of the measurement circulator , jpa , and cables to the beam splitter input .",
    "the noise contributions of all these components are represented by the noise temperature of the equivalent amplifier .",
    "therefore , the latter is a pessimistic estimate for the noise properties of the jpa itself .",
    "lcc & @xmath158 ( @xmath161 ) & @xmath159 + @xmath162 & @xmath163 & @xmath164 + @xmath165 & @xmath166 & @xmath167 +    @xmath159 has the unit of photon number .",
    "+ ( @xmath168 ) differently from the squeezed quadrature , where the added noise refers to the jpa output , this number refers to the jpa input for the anti - squeezed quadrature .    in figure",
    "[ fig : noise dp ] , we show the anti - squeezed and squeezed quadrature variance as a function of the noise source temperature . obviously , there is good agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "the corresponding numerical results are displayed in table  [ table : noise sum ] .",
    "most importantly , we observe a variance of @xmath169 photons ( referred to the input ) for the noise added by our jpa to the anti - squeezed quadrature .",
    "this value is clearly below the standard quantum limit of 0.25 photons for a single quadrature of a phase - insensitive amplifier .",
    "the relevant noise number for the use of the jpa as a squeezer is the noise it adds to the squeezed quadrature at the jpa output .",
    "we do not refer the added noise from the squeezed quadrature to the input of the equivalent jpa , because systematic uncertainties in the setup  @xcite dominate the squeezed quadrature noise variance at the jpa output and would be amplified by @xmath170 when referring to the jpa input . however , these uncertainties are negligible for the anti - squeezed quadrature . instead ,",
    "following  @xcite we calculate a lower bound for the squeezed quadrature noise variance at the jpa input from the experimentally more robust quadrature gains @xmath171 and @xmath172 of the squeezed and anti - squeezed quadrature and anti - squeezed quadrature noise variance .",
    "using the values from table  [ table : noise sum ] , we obtain the relation @xmath173 , where subscript  in \" indicates the jpa input .",
    "in summary , we present a detailed analysis of the physics of squeezed microwave light generated with a flux - driven jpa .",
    "we first determine the operation point of the jpa and characterize its basic amplification properties , including non - degenerate gain , bandwidth , @xmath34-compression point and degenerate gain .",
    "we then use the jpa to squeeze vacuum fluctuations and find @xmath1 of squeezing at @xmath0 signal gain .",
    "furthermore , we investigate displacement and photon number of squeezed coherent microwave fields and find excellent agreement with theoretical expectations . in the degenerate mode , we verify that our jpa , as a phase - sensitive device , adds less noise to the amplified quadrature than an ideal phase - insensitive amplifier .",
    "this property is of utmost importance for high efficiency detection , state tomography and quantum communication applications in the microwave domain .",
    "furthermore , with the setup used in this work , i.e. , squeezed states incident at a linear beam splitter , the generation of path entanglement between continuous - variable propagating quantum microwaves was demonstrated in  @xcite .",
    "considering recent work on the engineering of tunable beam splitter hamiltonians  @xcite , our setup could be extended to the interesting case of dynamical switching between two separable single - mode squeezed states and a path - entangled two - mode squeezed state .",
