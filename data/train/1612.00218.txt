    "open clusters evolve dynamically over time due to two - body relaxation and by the external forces of the interaction with the galactic tidal field . during this process",
    "open clusters experience structural changes @xcite which can be probed from the relationships between core , half - mass and tidal radii @xcite , among others . in this sense , the study of highly dynamically evolved open clusters results in a challenging field of research , since they often contain few members . on the other hand , they are suited to test the particular relationships between their initial masses and dynamical ages .",
    "identifying dynamically evolved open clusters helps to constrain initial conditions in models which pursue describing the cluster evolution from n - body simulations @xcite , such as the initial number of stars , the initial mass function , fraction of primordial binaries , etc . according to the most updated version of the open cluster catalogue compiled by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* as of 2016 january ) , a very limited number of objects have been studied with some detail from a dynamical point of view @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "we have recently started to focus our long - term campaing of improving the statistics of well studied open clusters by considering their dynamical evolutions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper , we present for the first time a comprehensive multi - band photometric analysis of seven open clusters , namely : ruprecht3 , 9 , 37 , 74 , 150 , eso324 - 15 and 436 - 2 from @xmath0 and washington @xmath1 photometry .",
    "most of them turned out to be open clusters approaching their disruption stage . in section 2",
    "we describe the collection and reduction of the available photometric data and their thorough treatment in order to build extensive and reliable data sets .",
    "the cluster structural ( e.g. , core and half - light radii ) and photometric ( e.g. , reddening , distance , age , mass ) parameters are derived from star counts and colour - magnitude and colour - colour diagrams , respectively , as described in sections 3 to 5 . the analysis of the results of the different astrophysical parameters obtained is carried out in section 6 , where implications are implied .",
    "finally , section 7 summarizes the main conclusion of this work .",
    "we downloaded johnson @xmath8 , kron - cousins @xmath9 and washington @xmath10 images from the public website of the national optical astronomy observatory ( noao ) science data management ( sdm ) archives .",
    "they were obtained using a 4k@xmath114k ccd detector array ( scale of 0.289@xmath12/pixel ) attached to the 1.0-m telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) , chile , in 2011 january 31february 4 ( ctio program # 2011a-0114 , pi : clari ) .",
    "table  [ tab : table1 ] presents the log of the observations , where the main astrometric and observational information is summarized .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we derived the masses of ruprecht9 , 37 , 74 , 150 and eso324 - 15 by summing the individual masses of stars with membership probabilities @xmath13 75% .",
    "the latter were obtained by interpolation in the theoretical isochrones traced in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] to [ fig : fig8 ] from the observed @xmath14 magnitude of each star , properly corrected by reddening and distance modulus .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in the mass to be @xmath15 @xmath6 0.2 dex . note",
    "that this error comes from propagation of the @xmath14 magnitude errors in the mass distribution along the theoretical isochrones .",
    "it does not reflect the deviation of the cluster mass computed from stars with @xmath13 75% from the actual cluster mass . nevertheless , at first glance , the appearance of the cluster cmds and cc diagrams ( @xmath13 75% ) do not seem to significantly differ from those including any other observed stars placed along the adopted isochrones with @xmath16 75% , thought to be cluster stars .",
    "the derived total cluster masses ( @xmath17 ) of ruprecht9 , 37 , 74 , 150 and eso324 - 15 are listed in table  [ tab : table11 ] .",
    "the resulting cluster mass functions ( mfs ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] where the errorbars come from applying poisson statistics .",
    "the solid lines represent the relationship given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* slope = -2.35 ) for the stars in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "we also used the relationship between the cluster mass and the cluster age derived by ( * ? ? ? * their equation 8) from 489 open clusters located closer than 2 kpc from the sun , to estimate the masses of the clusters in our sample .",
    "the computed masses ( @xmath18 ) are listed in table  [ tab : table11 ] . as can be seen",
    ", the @xmath17 values resulted to be @xmath6 10 - 15 per cent of @xmath18 ones , except for ruprecht37 whose @xmath17 is @xmath6 65 per cent of its @xmath18 value .",
    "alternatively , in order to have some other rough estimate of upper mass limits , we used the salpeter s law along with the zero points in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] , to estimate the cluster mass ( @xmath19 ) down to a star mass of 0.5@xmath20 .",
    "we derived masses 35 - 40 per cent larger than @xmath18 , except for eso324 - 15 whose @xmath19 value resulted to be 20 per cent larger that those from @xcite , respectively ( see table  [ tab : table11 ] ) .",
    "using the half - mass radii @xmath21 and masses of table  [ tab : table11 ] , we computed the half - mass relaxation times using the equation @xcite :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the @xmath18 value and @xmath24 is the mean mass of the cluster stars .",
    "we used @xmath25@xmath18 and @xmath25@xmath21 to estimate @xmath25@xmath26 .",
    "the resulting @xmath27 values are listed in the last column of table  [ tab : table10 ] .",
    "the comparison of the cluster ages with their respective @xmath27 values clearly reveals that all the clusters in the sample have survived hundreds of times their characteristic two - body relaxation times and should be much closer to a disruption stage .",
    "their total masses , which represent a mass loss around 85 - 90 per cent from their @xmath18 values -with the sole exception of ruprecht37 whose mass loss is around 35 per cent- , also confirm such a highly evolved dynamical stage .",
    "if we considered the @xmath19 values as the initial cluster masses instead , the mass loss would be still larger . note that the mass loss is due to both internal dynamical evolution and tidal effects . as for the galactic tidal field , (",
    "* see , e.g. , their figures 1 ) found that the difference in the potential wall between 6 and 100 kpc from the galactic centre leads to @xmath2 10 per cent variations in the half - mass radius for clusters younger than 4 gyr .",
    "thus , bearing in mind the galactocentric distances of the studied clusters ( @xmath28 = 9 @xmath29 1 kpc ) and their ages ( see table  [ tab : table10 ] ) , we considered the dynamical evolution as the main origin of mass loss .",
    "the effect of an important mass loss stand out in fig  [ fig : fig11 ] where the observed mfs depart from that of the salpeter s law towards lower stellar masses .",
    "surprinsingly enough is the fact that even though the surviving clusters keep small amounts of their @xmath18 and @xmath19 masses , the cluster cmds are still useful to derive their fundamental paramaters .    from the analysis of the derived structural paramaters , it is also feasible to draw conclusions about their present dynamical stage .",
    "@xcite presented a unified picture for the evolution of star clusters on the two - body relaxation timescale from direct n - body simulations of star clusters in a tidal field .",
    "their treatment of the stellar evolution is based on the approximation that most of the relevant stellar evolution occurs on a timescale shorter than a relaxation time , when the most massive stars lose a significant fraction of mass and consequently contribute to a global expansion of the system . later in the life of a star cluster , two - body relaxation tends to erase the memory of the initial density profile and concentration .",
    "they found that the structure of the system , as measured by the core to half - mass radius ratio , the concentration parameter @xmath30= log(@xmath31 ) , among others , evolve toward a universal state , which is set by the efficiency of heating on the visible population of stars induced by dynamical interactions in the core of the system .",
    "the concentration parameter @xmath30 for this model increases steadily with time .",
    "the resulting @xmath30 values for our clusters are within 0.9 and 1.1 ( 0.7 for ruprecht9 ) .",
    "these values correspond to star clusters in an advance stage of dynamical evolution .",
    "indeed , we compared our @xmath30 values with those for 236 open clusters analyzed by @xcite , who derived from them homogeneous scales of radii and masses .",
    "they derived core and tidal radii for their cluster sample , from which we calculated the half - mass radii and , with their clusters masses and equation 10 , relaxation times , by assuming that the cluster stellar density profiles can be indistinguishably reproduced by king and plummer models .",
    "their cluster sample is mostly distributed inside a circle of @xmath6 1 kpc from the sun and has @xmath30 values between @xmath6 0.1 up to 1.1 following a broad trend with the age/@xmath27 ratio , in the sense that the larger the @xmath30 values , the more dynamically evolved an open cluster .    according to ( *",
    "* see , e.g. , their figure 33.2 ) a star cluster dynamically evolving with its tidal radius filled , moves in the @xmath32 vs @xmath33 plane parallel to the @xmath32 axis ( @xmath33 @xmath6 0.21 ) toward low values due to violent relaxation in the cluster core region followed by two - body relaxation , mass segregation , and finally core - collapse .",
    "the derived @xmath33 ratio for the present cluster sample is 0.22 @xmath29 0.07 ( see table  [ tab : table10 ] ) , which is in excellent agreement with the expected value for a tidally filled cluster .",
    "curiously , the tidal radii are quit similar to the jacobi radii , which confirm that the studied clusters are tidally filled .",
    "the latter were calculated using the expresion @xcite :    @xmath34    where @xmath23 is the cluster mass and @xmath35 is the milky way ( mw ) mass inside the cluster galactocentric distance @xmath28 . to compute @xmath35",
    "(= 5@xmath1110@xmath36 ) we used the mw mass profile of @xcite .",
    "we found that @xmath37@xmath38-@xmath39@xmath37 @xmath40 @xmath25@xmath38 + @xmath25@xmath39 , meaning that cluster stars have occupied as much as possible the allowed volume without being stripped away from the cluster .",
    "in the same model by @xcite , the @xmath32 ratio ranges from 1.4 ( start of evolution ) down to 0.1 .",
    "the @xmath32 ratio of the studied clusters is 0.49 @xmath29 0.06 , which confirms their evolved dynamical stages .",
    "we present a comprehensive multi - band photometric analysis of seven catalogued open clusters , namely : ruprecht3 , 9 , 37 , 74 , 150 , eso324 - 15 and 436 - 2 .",
    "the objects were observed through the johnson @xmath8 , kron - cousins @xmath9 and washington @xmath10 filters ; four of them ( ruprecht9 , 74 , 150 and eso436 - 2 ) are photometrically study for the first time , while for ruprecht3 , 37 and eso324 - 15 , our photometric data sets surpass that from 2mass photometry .",
    "the multi - band photometric data sets were used to trace the cluster stellar density radial profiles and to build cmds and cc diagrams , from which we estimated their structural parameters and fundamental astrophysical properties .",
    "cluster radii were derived from a careful placement of the background levels in the radial profiles built from star count throughout the observed fields using the final photometric catalogues .",
    "we fitted king and plummer models to derive cluster core , half - mass and tidal radii .",
    "the constructed cluster cmds and cc diagrams were statistically cleaned from field star contamination using a powerful technique that makes use of cells varying in position and size in order to reproduce the field cmd as closely as possible .",
    "then , from six cleaned cmds and three cleaned cc diagrams covering wavelengths from the blue up to the near - infrared we estimated the cluster fundamental parameters .",
    "we exploited such a wealth in combination with theoretical isochrones to find out that the clusters in our sample are of intermediate - age ( 9.0 @xmath2 log(@xmath3 yr@xmath4 ) @xmath2 9.6 ) , of relatively small size ( @xmath5 @xmath6 0.4 @xmath7 1.3 pc ) and placed between 0.6 and 2.9 kpc from the sun .",
    "their total masses , computed by summing the individual masses of stars with photometric membership probabilities @xmath13 75% , resulted to be @xmath6 10 - 15 per cent of the cluster masses estimated from an independent robust calibration of the cluster mass as a function of the cluster age .",
    "the cluster mfs built using the same sample of stars also account for so high percentage of mass loss .",
    "we found that ruprecht3 and eso436 - 2 do not show self - consistent evidence to be physical systems .",
    "we compared the cluster masses , concentration parameters , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and age/@xmath27 ratios to those for 236 clusters located in the solar neighbourhood as well as to different theoretical models .",
    "we conclude that the studied clusters should be much closer to their disruption stage as a result of their internal dynamical evolution ( mass segregation ) and galactic tidal effects .",
    "the stars with photometric membership probabilities @xmath13 75% occupy a volume as large as those for tidally filled clusters .",
