    "model equations for free surface water waves propagating in a horizontal channel of uniform depth have been widely studied for many years .",
    "boussinesq models incorporate the lowest - order effects of nonlinearity and frequency dispersion as corrections to the linear long wave equation .",
    "these models are widely used for describing the propagation of non - linear shallow water waves near coastal regions . in boussinesq theory , it is important to assume that water is incompressible , inviscid and the flow is irrotational .",
    "there are two important parameters which are the nonlinearity , the ratio of amplitude to depth , represented by @xmath0 , and the dispersion , the ratio of depth to wavelength , represented by @xmath1 .",
    "as explained in detail in @xcite , the boussinesq approximation is valid only when both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are small and have the same order of magnitude .",
    "the more realistic situation of uneven bottom profile is fundamental to studies of ocean wave dynamics in coastal regions .",
    "several authors @xcite have included the effect of smooth and slowly varying bottom topographies in both boussinesq and shallow water theory .",
    "the ` classical ' boussinesq model was applied to shallow water of uneven bottom in two horizontal dimensions by peregrine @xcite , who used depth - averaged velocity as a dependent variable and derived the system    [ eq : per ] @xmath4&=&0 ,   \\label{eq : per1}\\\\ \\bar{\\textbf{u}}_t+\\nabla \\eta + ( \\bar{\\textbf{\\textbf{u}}}\\cdot \\nabla ) \\bar{\\textbf{u } } - \\frac{h}{2}\\nabla ( \\nabla \\cdot(h\\bar{\\textbf{u}}_t ) ) + \\frac{h^2}{6}\\nabla ( \\nabla \\cdot ( \\bar{\\textbf{u}}_t))&=&0 , \\label{eq : per2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the independent variable @xmath5 represents the position , @xmath6 represents the deviation of the free surface from its rest position at time @xmath7 , @xmath8 denotes the horizontal velocity of the fluid at some height , while @xmath9 denotes the depth - averaged velocity @xmath10 and the bottom is @xmath11 .",
    "several improved boussinesq - type models have been developed , starting with madsen et al .",
    "@xcite , nwogu @xcite and wei et al .",
    "@xcite , among others .",
    "madsen et al .",
    "@xcite achieved an improved linearized model by rearranging higher - order terms in the classical momentum equations , which are formally equivalent to zero within the accuracy of the model .",
    "nwogu @xcite demonstrated the flexibility obtained by using the velocity at an arbitrary distance from the still water level as the velocity variable .",
    "wei et al .",
    "@xcite used nwogu s approach to derive a fully nonlinear extensions of boussinesq equations which further extended the range of validity of boussinesq models without the weak nonlinearity restriction .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in @xcite the boussinesq model has been extended to moving bottom topography , where the bottom topography depends on @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath7 . in the paper @xcite ,",
    "a bbm - type system ( see @xcite ) has been derived and solved numerically using a finite element method .",
    "one way in which the bbm system differs from peregrine s boussinesq system is in the way it is amenable to numerical integration .",
    "indeed , it is much easier to define a stable numerical approximation to a system of bbm type than to other boussinesq systems , such as the peregrine system . on the other hand ,",
    "the peregrine system features exact mass conservation while mass conservation in the bbm - type systems is only approximate .",
    "nevertheless , in the current work , we use a system of bbm type for numerical convenience .",
    "the main contribution of the present paper is an in - depth study of wave reflection in a shoaling analysis based on of boussinesq systems such as .",
    "wave shoaling is the effect by which surface waves propagating shorewards experience a decrease in the water depth .",
    "the study of shoaling waves is of importance in the nearshore areas , and in the design of coastal structures . as part of our analysis",
    ", we formulate an approximate mass balance law associated to the boussinesq scaling , such as developed for flat bottoms in @xcite .",
    "we also extend the wave breaking criterion from @xcite to the case of uneven beds .",
    "the mass balance equation is used in quantifying wave reflection due to the bottom slope , and the wave breaking criterion is used to determine an approximate termination point for the shoaling curves .",
    "a significant amount of literature has focused on the use of nonlinear shallow water equations to analyse long wave shoaling on a mildly sloping beach , and both experimental and numerical investigations have been carried out .",
    "however , reflection has not been quantified .    many experimental studies , including the early studies @xcite were aimed partly at comparison with classical shoaling laws such as the laws of green and boussinesq .",
    "however , most experimental work on wave shoaling has shown that actual shoaling curves vary considerably from the predictions of both green s and boussinesq s law .",
    "grilli et al.@xcite solved the full euler equations by direct numerical integration and this work compares their shoaling results with the numerical solution obtained from the present work .",
    "wave breaking is also important in studying nearshore area phenomena and is also important for the study of tsunami propagation in coastal regions , because solitary waves are often used to model steep surface waves shoaling on beaches .",
    "an enormous literature also exists about breaking waves in a number of situations , including shoaling , wave breaking in open bodies of water , and breaking induced by a wavemaker ( see @xcite , for instance ) .",

    "@xcite discussed the criterion for the breaking of solitary waves on different slopes using the boundary element method to simulate the process of wave breaking . using the fully nonlinear potential flow wave model , grilli et al .",
    "@xcite derived a criterion for wave breaking . in this paper , a different criterion of breaking solitary waves on a sloping bottom of bbm - type system",
    "is derived based on previous work in @xcite .",
    "characteristics such as the breaking index , the waveheight , the water depth and the maximum particle velocity at the breaking point are studied and the breaking indices are compared with those obtained by grilli et al .",

    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : derivation ] , the outline for the derivation of the coupled bbm - type system @xcite is given , and also the mass balance equations and the wave breaking criterion are derived . in section [ sec : numericalmethods ] , the coupled bbm - type system is solved numerically using a fourier collocation method coupled with a 4-stage runge - kutta time integration scheme .",
    "we validate the convergence of the numerical scheme and demonstrate the effectiveness of the numerical method applied to our model system in simulations of solitary wave shoaling on a sloping bottom .",
    "mass reflection , shoaling and wave breaking are studied numerically .",
    "this paper compares two models ; the coupled bbm - type system derived by chen @xcite and the one in mitsotakis @xcite with respect to evolution of solitary waves .",
    "this comparison is concerned with initial wave profiles and wave shoaling on slopes that correspond to unidirectional propagation .",
