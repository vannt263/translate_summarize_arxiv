    "the randall - sundrum ii ( rs - ii ) model  @xcite is a brane world model , which provides a way to realize our four - dimensional world in a higher - dimensional spacetime requested by the string theory or the m - theory .",
    "rs - ii model is composed of five - dimensional bulk spacetime with negative cosmological constant and a four - dimensional brane with positive tension .",
    "matter fields are confined on the brane while gravity can propagate through the bulk spacetime .",
    "it is known that the weak gravitational field produced by a mass on the brane obeys the usual four - dimensional newton law with a correction suppressed at a large distance from the source  @xcite , though the extra - dimension extends infinitely in this model .",
    "this fact means that it is difficult to distinguish this model from an ordinary four - dimensional model as long as we investigate the weak gravity regime .",
    "thus we turn focus on the effect of strong gravity .",
    "we study the objects formed after gravitational collapse on the brane , in which the effect of strong gravity becomes essential .",
    "naively , a static black hole ( bh ) whose horizon is localized near the brane will be formed as a final state of gravitational collapse on the brane .",
    "there is an exact static solution with an event horizon , which is black string ( bs )  @xcite .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that a bs is formed as a result of gravitational collapse since the bs on the rs - ii model is singular and also unstable due to so - called gregory - laflamme instability  @xcite . a static solution of a large bh localized on the brane",
    ", however , has not been discovered yet , despite lots of effort on this issue  @xcite .",
    "numerical solution of a static brane - localized bh has been constructed when the horizon size is not much larger than the bulk curvature scale , but the construction becomes harder as the horizon size becomes larger  @xcite .",
    "this fact does not exclude the possibility that a static solution of brane - localized bh larger than the bulk curvature scale does exist , but we do not have any strong evidence of its existence . as an explanation of the lack of static solution , there is a conjecture that brane - localized static bhs larger than bulk curvature scale do not exist in rs - ii model based on the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite .",
    "there are several works related to this conjecture  @xcite , but no definite conclusion is obtained yet .",
    "it is desirable to investigate the possibility of the presence of static black hole solution directly in order to test the validity of this conjecture .",
    "however , it is technically difficult to construct a static large brane - localized bh numerically .",
    "thus , we consider time - symmetric initial data which have a brane - localized apparent horizon ( ah ) , expecting that their properties may give some insight into the brane - localized bh .",

    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we will explain the method how we construct initial data in sec .",

    "we also compare the adm mass and the five - dimensional horizon area of our initial data with that of the bs solution .",
    "we further investigate what kind of configuration realizes the minimum mass for a given ah area .",
    "we also compute the initial data in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional rs brane world , in which an exact static solution of brane - localized bh does exist  @xcite .",
    "the results are compared with those in ( 4 + 1)-dimensional case .",
    "section  [ sec fourd ] is devoted to summary and conclusion .",
    "in this section we introduce a construction method of time - symmetric initial data with a brane - localized ah in rs - ii model .",
    "the model is composed of two copies of five - dimensional empty bulk with negative cosmological constant @xmath0 separated by a @xmath1-symmetric positive tension brane .",
    "the tension of the brane satisfies the rs condition @xmath2 with @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the five - dimensional gravitational constant .",
    "the setup is compatible with a minkowski brane with ads bulk with the bulk curvature length being @xmath5 .",
    "the initial data we consider have @xmath6-symmetry in the spacelike dimension as well as the symmetry with respect to time reversal .",
    "these symmetries are property shared with static brane - localized bh solutions .",
    "hence , we think it appropriate to restrict our attention to this class of initial data .    in order to obtain a time - symmetric initial data of the rs - ii model",
    ", we have to solve the hamiltonian constraint equation in the bulk and on the brane simultaneously . in this paper , we do that by taking a constant time slice from a known vacuum solution with cosmological constant .",
    "we use five - dimensional ads ( topological ) bh solutions as such solutions . by using the bulk metric taken from a known solution ,",
    "the constraint equations in the bulk are automatically satisfied . in this spacetime",
    "we can find spacelike minimal hypersurfaces on a constant time slice , on which the expansion @xmath7 of out - going null geodesic congruence vanishes .",
    "even if those minimal hypersurfaces are not closed , they are candidates of the ah . by cutting this spacetime with a pure - tension brane with @xmath1-symmetry ,",
    "a part of ah candidate , even if they are not closed originally , can be reformed into a trapped surface . in placing a momentarily static brane with @xmath1-symmetry",
    ", we solve the brane configuration starting from a point on a @xmath8 hypersurface so as to satisfy the hamiltonian constraint on the brane . in this manner",

    "why is it an interesting question ?",
    "if there is a static localized bh solution , it gives a time - symmetric initial data .",
    "suppose that there is a static localized bh solution .",
    "then , if we can survey all possible time - symmetric initial data , the static solution must be found among them . moreover ,",
    "if the solution is stable , we expect that it will realize the maximum horizon area among all configurations with the same mass .",
    "hence , its horizon area must be greater than that of bs , too .",
    "hence , if we find a time - symmetric initial data that has the horizon area larger than bs , it suggests that there is a static brane - localized bh solution .",

    "we found that the boundaries are at around @xmath121 irrespective of the value of @xmath15 and @xmath122 .",
    "the panels ( c ) and ( d ) are the figures in the case of the hyperbolic ads bh background for @xmath123 and @xmath124 . in the gray region",
    "the ah area is larger than the bs horizon area .",
    "the initial data in the shaded region have an outer ah and they are excluded from the data set to conduct the horizon area comparison .",
    "we found that the ah area never becomes larger than the bs area when @xmath125 even in this case .",
    "namely , all the initial data that we can construct by the present method have a horizon area smaller than that of bs with the same adm mass if the ah area is larger than a typical size determined by the bulk curvature scale .",
    "this result is consistent with the classical bh evaporation conjecture , though it does not exclude the existence of counter - examples .",
    "as we stated above , if there is a static brane - localized bh solution , it must be contained in time - symmetric initial data , if we take into account all possible configurations .",
    "moreover , if the solution is stable , we expect that it will be realized as a maximum of the horizon area among all time - symmetric initial data with the same adm mass .",
    "although we can search only a limited part of time - symmetric initial data by our method , it will be still interesting to see which configuration realizes the maximum horizon area when the adm mass is fixed .",
    "technically , it is easier to fix the ah area than to fix the adm mass , because @xmath83 itself is one of the three parameters that label our initial data . to the contrary , in order to calculate @xmath92 , the information in the asymptotic region @xmath19 is needed .",
    "the initial data that realizes the maximum horizon area with the adm mass fixed should have the minimum adm mass when the ah area is fixed .",
    "therefore we fix the ah area and search for the initial data of the minimum adm mass varying the other parameters , @xmath15 and @xmath102 .",

    "the left ( right ) half of each plot corresponds to the initial data which have the spherical ( hyperbolic ) ads bh bulk .",
    "here we should remember that the shaded and dotted regions should be neglected because there is a true ah outside the original ahc .",
    "once we exclude these regions , we find that there is one and only one minimum of @xmath92 in all contour plots .",
    "we found that the mass minimum is realized on the spherical ads bh side when @xmath83 is smaller than a typical scale determined by the bulk curvature scale , i.e. when @xmath127 .",
    "the minimum seemed to be realized in the limit @xmath128 in this regime .",
    "as @xmath83 is increased , the location of the minimum moves toward the hyperbolic ads bh side .",
    "when @xmath129 , ah is very close to the event horizon of the ads bh bulk .",
    "if we further increase @xmath83 , @xmath102 at the mass minimum leaves @xmath105 and the minimum is realized in the limit @xmath130 , in which the bulk becomes the flat ads bh spacetime . in this regime",
    "the ah deviates from the event horizon of the ads bh bulk .",
    "we displayed the trajectories of the ah and the brane for the initial data with the minimum adm mass for three typical values of @xmath83 in fig .",
    "[ rawfig1e ] .",
    "when we consider a brane - localized bh which is small compared to the bulk curvature scale @xmath5 , the effect of brane tension is negligible .",
    "then we have an initial data which has the brane placed on the equatorial plane of the ads bh is approximately a static solution , at least , near the horizon .",
    "thus such an initial data will have the minimum adm mass among the configurations of the same ah area .",
    "our result completely agrees with this expectation .",
    "when the ah is large , the bulk curvature effect becomes large .",
    "then , five - dimensional ads bh with the brane on its equatorial plane is no longer close to a static configuration . in order to study the character of the initial data that realizes the minimum adm mass when @xmath131 , we computed the scalar curvature @xmath132 of the induced three metric on the ah .",
    "we plot @xmath132 against @xmath133 , the circumferential radius of @xmath86-two sphere , ( normalized by the bulk curvature length ) in fig .",

    "the dashed line shows the value of the intrinsic curvature of the bs horizon whose area is equal to @xmath139.,width=226 ]    since bs is an exact static solution , it will give a local or the global minimum of the adm mass for a given ah area .",
    "therefore there will be a dip with respect to the mass around the bs configuration in the complete parameter space of all possible time - symmetric initial data .",
    "however , we are not here investigating all possible configurations of time - symmetric initial data .",
    "our parameter space is very restricted .",
    "in fact , the bs configuration is not contained in our initial data . then , in the regime @xmath140 , the minimum of the adm mass in our present two - dimensional parameter space may correspond to the dip around the bs configuration .",
    "this is a scenario consistent with the conjecture that there is no static large brane - localized bh .",
    "however , it is also possible that the mass minimum that we found corresponds to a dip associated with another static brane - localized bh solution",

    "the behavior of these two solutions look quite different at first sight .",

    "however , if we compare the intrinsic curvature of the horizon of these two exact solutions shown in fig .",
    "[ rawfig_intah ] and fig .",
    "[ rawfig_intah_4d ] , the behavior is quite similar except for the region where the circumferential radius @xmath197 is small compared with the bulk curvature length scale @xmath5 .",
    "in order to have an insight into the black objects with a large horizon radius in the model of warped extra - dimension , we studied time - symmetric initial data of rs - ii model in five and four - dimensions .",
    "we constructed three - parameter family of time - symmetric initial data with a brane - localized ah , by placing a @xmath1-symmetric brane in the ads schwarzschild bulk .",
    "we have shown that one can construct initial data with an arbitrarily large ah area .",
    "our method of constructing the initial data requires just solving ordinary differential equations .",
    "hence , the conclusion that initial data with an arbitrarily large ah area exist is quite robust .    in the five - dimensional model",
    "the area of the obtained initial data was always smaller than the event horizon area of the bs solution whose mass is as large as the initial data when the horizon area is sufficiently large compared to the bulk curvature length cubed . in the following sense , this result is consistent with the scenario that these initial data evolve into configurations similar to bs , which is unstable through gregory - laflamme instability .",
    "the event horizon , which must exist outside the ah area , should have a larger area than ah .",
    "the area theorem tells that the area of the event horizon does not decrease as a course of time evolution , while the mass will not increase when there is no incoming energy flux from infinity .",
    "hence , if there is an initial data whose horizon area is significantly larger than that of bs with the same mass , such an initial data can not evolve into the configuration close to bs .",
    "we also explored the initial data that realizes the minimum mass with the ah area fixed , which is expected to be the closest to a static solution .",
    "we found that the initial data that realizes the minimum mass is close to the spherical ads bh with a brane on its equatorial plane when the ah area is small , while it is close to bs when the ah area is large .",
    "we conducted the same analysis also in the case of four - dimensional bulk spacetime since the situation looks quite different in this case .",
    "the bs solution does not exist , but we have an exact brane - localized bh solution found by emparan , horowitz and myers ( ehm ) , instead . nevertheless , the results of the analyses as to the time - symmetric initial data were quite similar to the five - dimensional case .",
    "we found that the area of the initial data is always larger than the ehm solution with the same mass , which is in harmony with the naive expectation that the ehm solution is the most stable black object in four - dimensional rs - ii model .",
    "unfortunately , the analysis presented in this paper did not provide a strong indication about the classical evaporation conjecture because the initial data that we examined were very limited .",
    "however , it is a remarkable progress that we have shown that time - symmetric initial data with a large ah area can be constructed . as a next step",
    ", we can consider the time evolution of these initial data .",
