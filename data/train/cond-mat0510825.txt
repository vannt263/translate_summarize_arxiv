    "as the scale of architectures in integrated circuit design continues to be reduced , the dimensions of present - day interconnects are on the scale of tens of nanometers , and the interconnects for next - generation nanoelectronic devices may well be just a few nanometers in lateral dimension .",
    "furthermore , the incorporation of nanometer - scale components , such as active molecules , into integrated circuits will require interconnects of a similar scale . on these scales ,",
    "self - assembled nanowire systems are becoming increasingly interesting@xcite , as conventional lithographic techniques reach their limits around 10 - 15nm@xcite and spm - based nanolithography@xcite methods lack scalability . moreover , the introduction of such `` bottom - up '' technology , based on naturally nanometer - scale components to complement or even replace the current `` top - down '' technology is likely to require completely different architectures .",
    "one example is the `` crossbar '' architecture@xcite , in which active molecules are used as devices at the junctions between two perpendicular nanowires .",
    "this architecture is designed to take advantage of the typical product of self - assembly schemes  an array of parallel wires  rather than relying on controlled positioning of individual wires .",
    "over the last ten to fifteen years , a number of systems have been identified which yield self - assembled nanowires on semiconductor surfaces , and stem from a mixture of serendipity and deliberate design .",
    "there are only a few systems which provide long , straight nanolines on flat terraces . in / si(111)@xcite ( amongst other metals ) and",
    "pt / ge(001)@xcite are examples of systems which undergo surface reconstructions leading to 1d atomic chains with metallic properties . on the si(001 ) surface ,",
    "the bi nanolines@xcite appear to be the only example of an atomically - perfect , straight , self - assembled 1d nanostructure , but are not metallic . aside from fortuitous discoveries ,",
    "symmetry - breaking by use of a vicinal surface to produce and array of steps can be used to grow long , straight nanowires of many metals , including au , bi et al.@xcite , and 1-d nanoscale structures can be designed by taking advantage of anisotropy in the heteroepitaxial strain between the si(001 ) surface and an appropriate deposited material .",
    "the rare - earth silicides are the archetype of this method@xcite . within the family of rare - earths ( as well as scandium and yttrium ) , a close lattice match can be obtained in one direction , with a variety of positive and negative lattice mismatchs in the orthogonal direction . by choosing the right material , metastable 1d nanoscale structures",
    "3 - 10  nm wide and hundreds of nanometres long can be formed .",
    "these have some phenomenological similarities with the bi nanolines , as will be described .",
    "this review will survey the growing field of nanowires on semiconductor surfaces , with the focus on the bi / si(001 ) nanoline system , whose importance is explained in the next section .",
    "the study of semiconductor surfaces has been revolutionised over the last twenty years by the advent of two techniques which give real - space atomic scale information : scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and electronic structure modelling ( in particular , density functional theory , or dft ) .",
    "the two techniques are complementary , in that stm gives an approximate answer to an exact question ( i.e. the structure of the real si(001 ) surface ) , while dft gives an exact answer to an approximate problem ( i.e. the lowest - energy structure of a computation cell containing a few si dimers , and a few layers of bulk - like si ) . while these techniques between them enabled the clear identification of the si(001 ) reconstruction",
    ", even today there is some controversy about the exact nature of the buckling of dimers on si(001 ) at low temperatures@xcite . in the same way",
    ", the understanding of the structure and properties of the nanolines surveyed in this paper has been greatly enhanced by a close collaboration between experiment and theory .",
    "the benefits of this synergistic approach will be drawn out throughout the discussion .",
    "the bi : si(001 ) nanoline system , which will be the focus of this review , was discovered about ten years ago . as can be seen from the examples in fig .",
    "[ fig : binanoline ] , they grow perfectly straight along the @xmath0 directions on the si(001 ) surface for hundreds of nanometres , apparently limited only by the terrace size of the underlying substrate . when they encounter a step edge , they will either grow out over lower terraces in a long , narrow promontory , or they will burrow into higher terraces , until a deep inlet is formed .",
    "they have a constant width , 1.5  nm or four substrate dimers , and are very stable .",
    "so long as the temperature is not so high that the bi can evaporate , they are stable against prolonged annealing , maintaining the same width .",
    "this is quite unlike the rare earth silicide systems which in most cases ( yttrium being the probable exception ) will coarsen into 3d epitaxial islands with long anneals .",
    "there are no other elements which produce perfect nanolines on the si(001 ) surface , although there is some evidence to suggest that sb nanowires with the same appearance as the bi nanoline form in the presence of surface hydrogen@xcite , and dft modelling that indicates that a sb nanoline would be stable@xcite",
    ". there has also been a suggestion that er may form nanolines of the same structure@xcite ( as opposed to silicide wires ) , but this remains unconfirmed .",
    "m@xmath11@xmath2 m .",
    "the bi nanolines run along @xmath0 directions , perpendicular to the si dimer rows , and can grow to over 1@xmath2 m in length . in the inset , the atomic structure , comprising a pair of bi dimers , about 6.5  apart , is shown .",
    "hydrogen termination of the bi nanolines has been used to enhance the apparent height of the nanoline . ]    structurally , the bi nanoline is unique amongst nanoline systems  it is neither a periodic reconstruction of the surface , nor the result of anisotropically strained heteroepitaxial growth of one bulk structure on another . in fact",
    ", it is somewhere in between .",
    "the nanoline structure is built around a pair of bi ad - dimers , on top of a complex subsurface reconstruction which is responsible for many of the nanoline s remarkable properties , such as the extreme straightness ; this will be explained in detail below . in this article",
    ", we intend to describe the formation , structure and properties of this system , setting it in the context of other nanoline systems , particularly the rare - earth silicide family .",
    "the paper is laid out as follows : in section  [ sec : methods ] we consider the methods used to examine the systems , both experimental and theoretical ; in section  [ sec : other - nanowires ] self - assembled nanowire systems _ other _ than the bi : si(001 ) nanowire system are described , with particular reference to the rare - earth silicide family ; in section  [ sec : bi - nanowires ] the bi : si(001 ) nanowire system is examined in detail , and in section  [ sec : conclusions ] the state of the field is considered and conclusions are drawn . in considering the nanowires in sections  [ sec : other - nanowires ] and  [ sec : bi - nanowires ] we consider first the formation and structure of the systems ( including the effects of annealing ) , followed by the electronic properties ( including conductance data where available ) and finish with the reactivity of the systems .",
    "since its invention in 1982 by binnig and rohrer at ibm , stm has allowed researchers to image dynamic surface processes , in real - space , with near - atomic resolution .",
    "stm as a technique bridges a variety of disciplines . in surface physics ,",
    "stm is unique as a real - space probe of electronic density of states of individual species ; the stm tip can be a passive observer of surface chemical reactions , and also an active catalyst of these reactions ; and stm allows for the direct observation of many phase transformation processes , albeit in 2d rather than 3d .",
    "however , this is not meant to be a review of capabilities of stm ; for that , the reader is pointed to classic books on the subject@xcite . here",
    "a few comments are made , which are pertinent to the particular challenges of elevated - temperature ( ` hot ' ) stm for the study of epitaxial growth .",
    "surface reactions can be followed at room temperature by using quench experiments , in which a high - temperature surface is cooled rapidly to freeze in a snapshot of an evolving surface , for example in the growth of iii - v semiconductor surfaces@xcite .",
    "however , the quenching process may introduce spurious surface features , and so it is preferable to image the surface _ in - situ _ ,",
    "i.e. at temperature .",
    "the ability to vary the sample temperature makes it possible to image a surface in the process of changing , rather than after it has changed . to give just one example",
    ", the phase transition between the ( 1@xmath11 ) reconstruction and the ( 7@xmath17 ) reconstruction on the si(111 ) surface , at around 1100k , has been observed directly in both directions , by careful control of the temperature across the transition@xcite .",
    "for useful observations of dynamic processes , the speed of the reaction must be matched to the rather slow imaging rate of an stm .",
    "one example is the motion of step edges@xcite . at around 300@xmath3c",
    ", step motion can be imaged as the addition or subtraction of 4 atoms between stm images .",
    "however , above about 500@xmath3c , the step edge will have moved significantly in the time taken for the stm to scan one line .",
    "thus from line to line , the step will be in different places , as it oscillates about a mean position . in stm , therefore , fast - moving steps have a streaky appearance above 500@xmath4c , as may be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nucleationstm ] .",
    "furthermore , mobile species may be invisible at elevated temperatures , either due to the decrease in contrast , or due to their mobility .",
    "surface chemical processes , such as the diffusion of si atoms on si(001)@xcite or the decomposition of a molecule@xcite , can be studied at the single - species level , and complete chemical reaction pathways from initial adsorption can be followed through to complete decomposition@xcite .",
    "kinetic information such as activation barriers can be extracted , and any metastable intermediate structures can be imaged , giving a unique insight into the reaction process .",
    "the ability to control the substrate temperature is particularly important in studies of epitaxial growth , where the kinetic pathways available at different temperatures will determine the surface morphology . in the case of si / si(001 ) and",
    "ge / si(001 ) epitaxy , it has been possible to image the surface simultaneously with the deposition of material , and therefore observe directly the nucleation of islands , and the growth of these nuclei into 1d , 2d and 3d islands , along with associated processes , such as the ripening of epitaxial islands , surface stress relief mechanisms , and the transition from island growth to step flow growth modes@xcite , all of which processes occur at different sample temperatures .",
    "however , these added abilities bring with them a penalty in sensitivity .",
    "there is generally a loss of resolution due to thermal noise above room temperature , and a loss of stability , with thermal drift making it hard to image the same area for extended periods . in many of the high - temperature stm images shown here ,",
    "the nanolines have a curved appearance .",
    "they have no curvature themselves , the appearance comes from the drift during scanning .",
    "furthermore , imaging of epitaxial growth necessarily involves imaging a surface where there are many atoms loosely bound to the surface , or in the gas phase being deposited . in this situation ,",
    "it is very easy for atoms to stick to the stm tip , which can have adverse effects on the imaging , and it is usually preferable to obtain stable imaging conditions rather than achieve the highest possible resolution , which is generally a more unstable situation .",
    "for the same reason , scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) , or current imaging tunneling spectroscopy(cits ) , becomes unfeasible at elevated temperatures .",
    "it is generally better to take a series of images of the same area at different bias voltages , giving voltage contrast of an object , although as the feedback loop is active in this situation , the tip - sample distance will vary , and so the information gained is not equivalent to sts / cits .",
    "thus these limitations mean that while high - temperature stm brings the unique ability to study evolving surface morphology in real - space , it is not always the best way to study growth surfaces .",
    "a combination of high - temperature studies , and room - temperature studies of quenched surfaces , is likely to provide a fuller description of a system .",
    "there have been a number of books on modelling techniques published recently@xcite , so this section will feature only a brief description of the techniques used for modelling of semiconductor surfaces , concentrating on electronic structure calculations ( both semi - empirical and _ ab initio _ ) .",
    "these techniques retain the quantum mechanics of the electrons while treating the ions classically .",
    "the first problem to consider is how to model a semi - infinite piece of material ( that is , a surface ) .",
    "the approximation that is used is to consider a small piece of appropriate material with boundary conditions .",
    "generally , one of two solutions is used : either a cluster of atoms , with the dangling bonds on the edges terminated in some suitable way ( e.g. hydrogen ) , or a slab of atoms with periodic boundary conditions in two or three directions .",
    "a cluster allows a smaller number of atoms to be used than a slab , but has the drawback that it is hard to allow for long - range strain effects ( such as those caused by reconstructions or steps on surfaces ) .",
    "a slab approach requires care : the vacuum gap between repeating images must be large enough to prevent interactions , and the slab itself must be sufficiently thick to allow strain relaxation .",
    "the slab approach is more commonly used , particularly with the methods described below .",
    "once the system to be modelled has been defined , the calculation technique must be chosen . putting aside quantum chemical methods for the sake of brevity ( they scale rather poorly with system size  for more details ,",
    "the reader is directed to one of many excellent books on the subject@xcite ) , we will consider the semi - empirical tight binding ( tb ) technique , and the _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) technique .",
    "tb@xcite postulates a basis set of atom - centred orbitals for the wavefunctions ; the schrdinger equation can then be rewritten as a matrix equation , with elements of the hamiltonian matrix formed from integrals between orbitals on different atoms .",
    "these hamiltonian matrix elements are _ fitted _ to either _ ab initio _ calculated data or experimental results . for simplicity",
    ", the basis is often assumed to be nearest neighbour only ( with a cutoff defined on the range of interactions ) and orthogonal .",
    "once the hamiltonian has been defined , the band energy of the system can be found by diagonalisation of the hamiltonian or other methods .",
    "the other energetic terms ( e.g. hartree correction , exchange and ion - ion interactions ) are represented by a repulsive potential ( often a pair potential ) .    despite its apparent simplicity ,",
    "tb is extremely effective , and generally qualitatively accurate , if not approaching quantitative .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that this tb formalism can be derived from dft via a set of well - defined approximations , which explains to some extent its success .",
    "it is well - suited for a rapid exploration of configuration space ( e.g. possible structures for some new surface feature@xcite ) provided that a suitable parameterisation exists for the bonds between different species .",
    "the fitting of parameterisations is non - trivial , and the transferrability of a given parameterisation ( i.e. its accuracy in environments far from those in which the fitting was performed ) is never guaranteed .",
    "generally the matrix elements themselves are fitted to a band structure ( or energy levels of a molecule ) , while their scaling with distance is fitted to elastic constants or normal modes of the system .",
    "tb retains quantum mechanics ( since the energy is obtained by solving the schdinger equation ) while approximating the most complex problems .",
    "dft@xcite starts with an exact reformulation of the quantum mechanics of a system of interacting electrons in an external potential : the result is a set of equations for non - interacting electrons moving in an _ effective _ potential with all the complex electron - electron interactions in a single term , known as the exchange - correlation functional ( it is a function of the charge density , which is itself a function of position , hence `` functional '' ) .",
    "unfortunately , the form of this functional is not known , and must be approximated , for instance with the local density approximation ( lda ) or one of the generalised gradient approximations ( gga ) .",
    "dft has been extremely successful in many areas of physics , chemistry , materials and , increasingly , biochemistry , particularly when combined with the pseudopotential approximation .",
    "the hard nuclear potential and the core electrons of each atom are replaced with a single `` pseudopotential '' , and only the valence electrons are considered , leading to a softer potential .",
    "this approximation is most effective for atoms where there is considerable screening of the valence electrons by the core electrons ( e.g. in si the 3s electrons are screened by the 1s and 2s shells , while the 3p electrons are screened by the 2p shell ) ; in first row elements and first row transition metals , this is a much smaller effect , leading to the development of `` ultrasoft '' pseudopotentials .",
    "these issues are discussed in more detail in many excellent books and reviews@xcite . the essential point to note",
    "is that dft is widely used for electronic structure calculations , and provides results which are accurate to within approximately 0.1ev .",
    "an important development in electronic structure techniques over the last ten years is that of linear scaling techniques@xcite .",
    "standard techniques for solving for the ground state , whether tb or dft , scale with the cube of the number of atoms in the system ( either because matrix diagonalisation scales with the cube of the matrix size , or because the eigenfunctions spread over the whole simulation cell , leading to cubic scaling when they are orthonormalised ) .",
    "this scaling places rather strong restrictions on the sizes of system which can be modelled , even on massively parallel machines : for _ ab initio _ methods , going beyond 1,000 atoms rapidly becomes prohibitive , though somewhat larger systems can be addressed .",
    "however , since electronic structure is fundamentally local ( consider bonding as an example ) , the amount of _ information _ in the system should be proportional to the number of _ atoms _ in the system .",
    "tight binding methods which take advantage of this ( e.g. refs.@xcite ) have been widely used for some time , allowing calculations on many thousands of atoms .",
    "the implementation of linear scaling dft algorithms has proved significantly harder , though recent efforts in nearly linear@xcite and linear scaling methods@xcite suggest that these techniques are starting to produce useful and general results .",
    "one of the challenges of using stm to examine semiconductor surfaces is that the current arises from both geometric and electronic structure , though this is less true at high biases ( where height or geometric structure will dominate ) .",
    "some technique is required to understand these changes , and to test proposed structures against experiment .",
    "the field of stm simulation is a complex one ( in part because the structure and composition of the tip is unknown ) ; the interested reader is referred to excellent reviews for further information@xcite .",
    "we will briefly summarise the simplest and most common approximation used , and discuss how the experimental - theoretical interaction can best proceed .",
    "the most commonly used approach is the tersoff - hamann approximation@xcite .",
    "this asserts ( via a careful series of approximations ) that the tunneling current is proportional to the local density of states ( ldos ) due to the sample at the position of the tip . in effect , the tip is assumed to have a flat density of states .",
    "this approach is directly equivalent to considering the projected charge density ( i.e. the partial charge density due to each band for bands within @xmath5 of the fermi level ) .",
    "it is qualitatively accurate , though will not reproduce the observed corrugation values correctly@xcite .",
    "the authors are of the opinion that for true success in investigating nanowires ( and other systems ) on semiconductor surfaces , a close collaboration between experiment and modelling is required .",
    "any successful collaboration depends on a number of factors , but the key factors , we believe , are frequent , easy correspondence , an understanding of the limitations and abilities of the appropriate techniques , and trust between the different sides in the collaboration .",
    "the last point extends to sharing of unpublished data , and extensive discussion of possible courses of action .",
    "the three authors have been working together in different combinations for ten years ( leading to around 20 joint publications ) , and we find that our collaboration is still immensely fruitful .",
    "while the bi / si(001 ) nanolines have remarkable structural qualities , they are not the only self - assembled nanowire system on semiconductor surfaces . in this section we present an overview of these other nanowire systems ( more details are presented elsewhere@xcite ) , and we will consider in more detail the most important of these systems , the rare - earth silicide family , focussing on their structure and formation , electronic properties and reactivity .        a variety of metals have been found to self - assemble into nanowires or nanolines on the si(001 ) surface , though none with the perfection of the bi nanolines .",
    "the simplest way in which to form 1d structures on the si(001 ) surface is by epitaxial growth .",
    "an island nucleus is essentially an ad - dimer , which sits between the dimer rows .",
    "the two pairs of si dimers which support the ad - dimer are distorted by its presence , and so are attractive adsorption sites for further ad - atoms or ad - dimers@xcite .",
    "this process has been described as a surface polymerisation reaction@xcite .",
    "the long sides of the string , which are equivalent to a - type steps on this surface , have a very low sticking coefficient which keeps the island from broadening at lower growth temperatures .",
    "deposition of group iii and group iv elements on si(001 ) will therefore result in long 1d chains of dimers@xcite . however , there is little control over the length or structure of these wires , and they are unstable against annealing , eventually reorganising into compact islands .",
    "the pt / ge(001 ) system@xcite forms nanowires through a complex surface reconstruction , resulting in a system with a high degree of perfection , which approaches that of the bi nanolines . when annealed to high temperatures , arrays of atomically perfect nanowires of pt / ge form ,",
    "each of which is 0.4  nm wide with a spacing of 1.6  nm between the wires .",
    "sideways growth of two - dimensional islands can also be blocked by introduction of missing dimer trenches . these form to relieve surface stress , either because of contamination by a small amount of a transition metal such as ni , or through heteroepitaxial growth of another material such as ge .",
    "the trenches tend to line up in a semiregular array , giving an approximate ( 2@xmath1n ) reconstruction in leed , with n@xmath68 - 12 ( though the regularity of the trenches is rather poor ) .",
    "this method has been used to deposit a variety of metals , such as fe@xcite , ga@xcite and in@xcite ( using the ni - based technique ) and the molecule styrene@xcite .",
    "the result is long - range , reasonably well ordered wires of the metals , though their properties have not been characterised .",
    "the 2d symmetry of the surface can also be broken deliberately by the use of vicinal substrates to produce regular arrays of steps@xcite which can then be decorated with materials such as gold@xcite and bi@xcite .",
    "this approach is used primarily on si(111 ) , although with an extreme orientation towards ( 112 ) directions the surface might be labelled si(557 ) or si(5 5 12 ) depending on the angle .",
    "the resulting step reconstructions comprise chains which are metallic and one - dimensional ; early observations suggested possible observations of luttinger liquid behaviour@xcite , though this has been disputed@xcite .",
    "their spacing can be controlled to some extent by varying the angle of miscut of the surface .    as an atomic - scale extension of the idea of lithography , the si(001 ) surface",
    "has been passivated with atomic hydrogen ( forming the monohydride phase ) and individual hydrogen atoms removed with an stm tip to form atomic - scale patterns . the wire formed by removal of hydrogen atoms along ( or across )",
    "a dimer row is known as a `` dangling bond '' wire ( or db wire)@xcite and is predicted to show conduction effects similar to conjugated polymers with polaronic and solitonic effects@xcite .",
    "an example of a dangling - bond wire is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hashizume](a ) .",
    "these wires have been reacted with a variety of adsorbates including iron@xcite , gallium@xcite , aluminium@xcite , silver@xcite and organic molecules such as norbornadiene@xcite . however , although for a single row of dangling bonds , a perfect atomic wire can be formed , as with ga in fig .",
    "[ fig : hashizume](b ) , for greater widths , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : hashizume](c , d ) , the dangling bond wire is more ragged , and the resulting wires ( here ag ) are typically composed of a large density of small , roughly spherical crystals , which exhibit many imperfections and boundaries .",
    "a more elegant implementation stems from careful application of molecular chemistry to produce a directed reaction : when the monohydride surface was exposed to styrene and _ one _ hydrogen atom removed , self - directed growth of lines of styrene resulted from a chain reaction between each adsorbed molecule and an adjacent hydrogen@xcite .",
    "such self - organised methods are important for the growth of molecular nanowires on surfaces . however ,",

[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the most common form of rare - earth nanowire ( renw ) formed on si(001 ) is thought to result from the anisotropic strain between the alb@xmath9 crystal structure of the nanowire and the si(001 ) substrate , leading to fast growth along the less - strained direction , and extremely limited growth along the more - strained direction .",
    "the mismatch for various silicides in the alb@xmath9 hexagonal structure is given in table  [ tab : rare - earth - mismatch ] .",
    "renws of this type have been reported for er@xcite , dy@xcite , gd@xcite and ho@xcite . for sm@xcite nws",
    "only appear on vicinal substrates ; other reports@xcite find that on flat surfaces only rectangular , 3d islands are formed after a ( 2@xmath13 ) layer ) .",
    "bundles of nws have been reported for yb@xcite ; again , early reports@xcite suggested that nws were not formed , and 3d islands resulted from annealing . though they are not rare - earth metals , similar nws have been reported for both sc@xcite and y@xcite , resulting from the same combination of crystal structure and anisotropic strain .",
    "although it forms a similar wetting layer on the substrate to yb , eu does not form nws@xcite .",
    "the resulting renws are found both individually and in bundles ; the individual wires have sizes which vary from element to element but are in general 5 - 10  nm wide and less than 1  nm high .",
    "the wires grow extremely fast , reaching lengths of up to 1@xmath2 m ; more interestingly they always run along @xmath10 directions and will grow out over step edges , drawing terraces with them , features that they share with bi nanolines . the large - scale image in fig .",
    "[ fig : silicide1 ] is very similar to that of bi nanolines at the same scale . for almost all materials ,",
    "the surface of the wires shows a c(2@xmath12 ) reconstruction@xcite , though the yb nws , which are off - axis relative to the other renws , may have a ( 1@xmath11 ) surface@xcite .",
    "the si(111 ) surface matches the lattice of the re alb@xmath9 structure reasonably well in all directions ( with a mismatch of less than 2% for most metals)@xcite and so would not be expected to give anisotropic growth , but gdsi@xmath9 nws have been formed along step edges of a vicinal surface@xcite .",
    "these form because of a mismatch perpendicular to the step edge , and grow to over 1@xmath2 m long on appropriately prepared samples , with a width of 10  nm and height of 0.6  nm .",
    "other nw structures have been reported for transition metals on si(111 ) , for instance fe@xcite ( though these are rather short wires ) , ni@xcite and ti@xcite .",
    "the growth mechanism for these wires is not entirely clear : the resulting nws are 5  nm high and 5  nm wide ( nisi@xmath9 ) , 10  nm high and 40  nm wide ( tisi@xmath9 ) , though for both of these systems the nws appear to grow _ into _ the substrate somewhat .",
    "there is a technique for growing nws on si(001 ) , si(110 ) and si(111 ) explicitly relying on growth into the substrate , resulting in `` endotaxial '' nws , which has been applied to dy@xcite in the hexagonal alb@xmath9 structure , as well as co@xcite , which takes the caf@xmath9 structure .",
    "the driving force appears to be kinetic in these systems : the long direction of the nw has an interface which grows faster than the short direction , though this is partly dependent on the structure of the interface below the surface .",
    "the growth and formation of the renws is not understood at an atomic level : they form extremely quickly ( on experimental timescales ) so that , for instance , hot stm can not be used to observe formation of the lines . unlike the bi nanolines , which have a constant width , and do not change in width with annealing , the rare - earth nanoline family can take a variety of widths depending on the growth conditions . in the case of dysi@xmath11 , single nws of a consistent width form from the underlying ( 2@xmath17 ) reconstructed wetting layer , as in fig .",

    "however , further annealing results in the formation of bunches of nanowires , which join together where they meet , and multilayer islands form .",
    "as strained coherent heteroepitaxial islands , the renws are only metastable ; prolonged annealing will cause them to coarsen , and form large 3d islands .",
    "overall , the deposition / anneal temperature must be in the window between 550@xmath4c and 650@xmath4c , and annealing time should not exceed 2 - 10 minutes . below",
    "550@xmath4c or 2 minutes , the reaction will be incomplete and the nws formed will be immature . above 650@xmath4c or 10 minutes",
    "the systems tend towards lower energy , thermodynamically stable states .",
    "in particular , dy - si(001 ) will form 3d islands if annealed for long times ( e.g. 30 minutes for 0.86ml)@xcite with wires formed for shorter annealing periods .",
    "annealing er - si(001 ) initially results in nws , but as the annealing time is increased dislocations form in the nws@xcite .",
    "if the temperature is raised beyond 620@xmath4c the same behaviour is seen , leading ultimately to coarsening into islands@xcite .",
    "a large - scale peem study of ersi@xmath11@xcite found that large nws ( which may have been bundles of nanowires  the technique does not have the resolution to distinguish ) were not affected by annealing on a coarse scale .",
    "however , gd shows more complex behaviour .",
    "annealing studies of thin films of gd found that both hexagonal and orthorhombic phases could form@xcite , and that with longer annealing times the orthorhombic phase grew at the expense of the hexagonal phase .",
    "long anneals of the gd / si(001 ) system , up to 620@xmath4c for one hour , resulted in the formation of previously unknown silicide structures , which are aligned perpendicular to hexagonal silicide nws on the same terrace@xcite .",
    "there are various useful observations of their behaviour which can be made :    * a wetting layer with a characteristic reconstruction forms before the nanowires , and persists on the substrate with the nanowires ; specific reconstructions have been observed for : * * eu - si(001):(2@xmath13)@xcite , * * sm - si(001):(2@xmath13)@xcite , * * yb - si(001):(2@xmath13)@xcite and ( 2@xmath14)@xcite , * * nd - si(001):(2@xmath13 ) and ( 2@xmath14)@xcite , * * dy - si(001):(2@xmath14)@xcite , and ( 2@xmath15 ) and ( 2@xmath17)@xcite , * * gd - si(001):(2@xmath14)@xcite , and ( 2@xmath15 ) and ( 2@xmath17)@xcite * * ho - si(001):(2@xmath14 ) and ( 2@xmath17)@xcite * the only system for which this does not happen is er - si(001)@xcite . *",
    "the system must be heated during deposition or annealed post - deposition to allow reaction of the rare - earth metal with the substrate@xcite * annealing the system for too long , or depositing at too high a temperature , can result in 3d islands rather than nanowires ; this is discussed in more detail below .",
    "as different metals have different properties for each of these categories , we will discuss them briefly in turn .",
    "gd and dy@xcite form a ( 2@xmath14 ) reconstruction first , followed by a ( 2@xmath17 ) reconstruction@xcite just prior to nanoline formation .",
    "rather similar behaviour is seem for ho@xcite .",
    "the metal fraction in the two reconstructions is 3/8 and 5/14 ml respectively@xcite .",
    "for these three metals , the presence of the wetting layer is intimately connected with formation and stability of the nanowires .    despite the wealth of studies of ersi@xmath9 nanowires , there are no reports of the structure and make - up of a wetting layer for this system ; there is some evidence@xcite that once more than @xmath60.05ml of er is deposited , long chains of surface dimers form , followed by nanowires , with no intermediate reconstruction . indeed , there are indications@xcite that the surrounding substrate is clean si(001 ) .",
    "another group of metals form closely related reconstructions : eu@xcite , yb@xcite , nd@xcite and sm@xcite all form ( 2@xmath13 ) and in some cases ( 2@xmath14 ) reconstructions ; by contrast to er , dy , gd and ho , these metals are strained in both surface directions on contact with si(001 ) ( which might be expected to reduce the periodicity of any substrate wetting ) and lack the main driving force seen before for nanowire formation . in general",
    "these metals do not form nanowires@xcite though there are certain conditions where yb can be made to form nanowires@xcite of some kind , which may well be grown off - axis ( in a different growth mode to the other silicide nanowires which grow with the c - axis aligned with the substrate ) .",
    "it is also possible to induce nanowire formation in situations where they would not normally form , either because of uniform lattice matching ( e.g on si(111 ) surfaces , as mentioned above ) or lattice mismatch in _ both _ surface directions using step edges .",
    "this technique has been successfully employed for sm on si(001)@xcite and gd@xcite and dy@xcite on si(111 ) .",
    "one of the original technological interests in rare - earth overlayers on si(111 ) was the good crystal growth possible due to the interface between the silicon and the overlayer , and the conductivity properties .",
    "the films have good conductivity and a low schottky barrier ( @xmath60.4 ev on n - si and @xmath60.8 ev on p - si@xcite ) .",
    "measurement of the conductivity of renws is a significant challenge .",
    "full two - point or four - point measurements requires either a unique stm instrument ( for instance one used to measure conductivity of cosi@xmath9 nanowires on si(110)@xcite ) , or alternatively the formation of nanoscale contacts to a nw@xcite .",
    "while significant progress has been made in this area recently , any measurements of conductivity will include the resistance of the interface between the nw and the contacts .",
    "scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) has been performed on various nws : dy and ho@xcite and gd@xcite . while sts does not measure the conductivity _ along _ the nw , it does measure the local electronic structure , and in all cases the nws are found to be metallic , while the surrounding reconstructed substrate is not@xcite .",
    "this is good evidence that the nws are taking on the bulk silicide structure , which is conducting , and the wetting layer is an intermediate state which relieves strain .",
    "conductivity measurements of transition metal silicides on si(111 ) and si(110 ) have been made@xcite .",
    "these studies exemplify the two techniques for measuring nw conductivity : nisi@xmath9 nws were contacted by gold pads@xcite , while four - probe stm measurements were made on cosi@xmath9 nws@xcite .",
    "these nws are relatively large compared to the renws discussed so far : 15 nm ( ni ) and 60 nm ( co ) wide .",
    "the cosi@xmath9 nws showed a high schottky barrier and conductivity equivalent to that of high quality thin films of cosi@xmath9 , while the nisi@xmath9 nws showed some signatures of quantum transport , though the conductivity of these wires was significantly lower than thin films ; this is likely due to the overgrowth of the sample with sio@xmath9 for transfer to the lithography apparatus .",
    "there is very little data on the chemical reactivity of the rare - earth nanowires .",
    "thin films on si(111 ) are susceptible to reaction with o@xcite ; the renws oxidise rapidly in air@xcite , and transition metal nws show signs of this ( confirmed by the conductivity of nisi@xmath9 nws on si(111)@xcite ) . in the tm system ,",
    "the nws were overgrown with native oxide , and showed a significant decrease in conductivity relative to complete thin films of similar thickness , which is attributed to scattering at the nw surface / oxide interface .",
    "further information on the reactivity comes from the deposition of pt on a surface containing ersi@xmath9 nws on si(001)@xcite .",
    "the pt was deposited at room temperature and the sample was subsequently annealed .",
    "when stm images were taken they showed that the c(2@xmath12 ) surface reconstruction on the nws was no longer visible though the ( 2@xmath11 ) substrate reconstruction was still present .",
    "furthermore , the pt - covered nws were resistant to reactive ion etching and appeared stable when exposed to air for periods of up to 8 weeks ; the pt overlayer does appear to strain the nws , however , leading to delamination of the nws from the substrate if left untreated .",
    "clearly there is much work to be done understanding the reactivity and stability of these nws .",
    "the discovery that nanowires would form if a bi - covered si(001 ) surface was left to anneal around the bi desorption temperature was made quite by chance . in 1995 , in the materials department of oxford university , two of the authors were investigating the surfactant - assisted growth of ge / si(001 ) using bi as a surfactant , and were studying the properties of bi / si(001 ) . when a sample which had been left to anneal at _ ca . _",
    "500@xmath3c overnight was imaged , very large , flat terraces , and long , straight , bright lines ( longer than the scanning range of the stm ) , running across the surface were found .",
    "these were the bi nanolines .",
    "the first published image of the `` nanobelts '' was in 1997@xcite , and the first big study of their growth and properties came in 1999@xcite . in this section , we will discuss the atomic structure of the bi nanoline , and its physical and electronic properties .",
    "we show that many of the properties stem from its unusual structure .",
    "the reaction of the bi dimers with a variety of reagents , and the effect of burial of the nanoline will also be discussed .",
    "the physical structure is the key to understanding the properties of a nanoline system , and great effort has been devoted to identifying the structure of the bi nanoline . in this case , the structure was identified by a synergy of stm observations with tightbinding and dft simulations .",
    "the three different proposed models for the bi nanoline are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : models ] .",
    "the two early models ( shown as the top two models ) share certain structural motifs .",
    "they contain a pair of bi dimers set into the surface layer of the si(001 ) crystal , whose compressive stress is relieved by missing dimer defects ( dvs ) .",
    "the first model proposed , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : models](a ) , was based around a pair of bi dimers in the surface layer , separated by a missing dimer defect , so as to relieve the local stress of the bi dimers@xcite .",
    "this became known as the miki model .",
    "the second proposed model , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : models](b ) , was based around a pair of bi dimers with defects on either side@xcite , which became known as the naitoh model",
    ". however , the third model is more complex : a reconstruction of several layers of si underneath the bi dimers produces the nanoline core .",
    "this was named the haiku model@xcite .",
    "of the three models , this structure is the only one to fit all the criteria which have been determined from stm observations , as well as having the lowest energy of the three . in this section , we will briefly review the historical process by which this structure was determined , and discuss the properties of the haiku structure .",
    "early stm images of the bi nanoline were taken at elevated temperature@xcite , in which the si dimers were not resolved , and hence the registry of the nanoline with the substrate was unknown .",
    "this data suggested that the nanoline contained two features , which were probably bi dimers , with a spacing of approximately 6.3 , with a total width of about 1  nm , which was approximately equivalent to the space of three si dimers .",
    "as the nanolines appeared bright at large bias voltages ( in both positive and negative bias images ) to dark at low voltages , it was also reasonable to assume that these bi dimers were situated in the surface layer , rather than in an adlayer or in a subsurface layer .",
    "it was thought that bi dimers embedded in the top surface layer would have considerable compressive stress , and on this basis , a model based around a 1dv , with bi dimers to either side , was proposed .",
    "this was the miki model@xcite .",
    "tightbinding calculations of the miki model@xcite found that it was more stable than the ( 2@xmath11 ) or ( 2@xmath1n ) bi reconstructions , and that the formation energy of a defect in the line was high : around 1.1 ev@xcite ( this number considers putting the bi which has been removed as an ad - dimer on the surface ; recent data@xcite shows that the defect energy falls to 0.11 ev if the bi dimer is placed in another miki model ; this point is discussed more fully in section  [ sec : miki - model - revisited ] below ) .",
    "dft calculations@xcite agreed with those conclusions .",
    "the calculated ldos showed that the bi dimer states were further away from the fermi level than those of the si dimers and simulated stm images of the miki structure@xcite showed that the line would appear dark at low bias voltages , in agreement with stm results@xcite .",
    "testing by other methods appeared to confirm this structure .",
    "photoemission spectroscopy experiments@xcite found that the bi 5d core - level spectra of the bi nanowire was essentially identical to the spectra of the ( 2@xmath1n ) phase composed of bi ad - dimers .",
    "this suggested that the local chemical state and registry of bi adsorbates for both phases was the same , i.e. that the bi was in the form of dimers in the top layer of the structure .",
    "x - ray photo - electron diffraction ( xpd ) experiments@xcite found a good fit between the experimental xpd data and simulated xpd intensity peaks from the miki model . in particular",
    ", they confirmed the presence of bi dimers parallel to the si dimers and found the spacing between them to be @xmath66.3 , in agreement with the stm measurement , though it is important to note that the quoted distances are the result of a _ fit _ to the miki model .",
    "10  nm stm image of the si(001):h surface .",
    "the h termination makes it easier to resolve the individual si dimers .",
    "a series of markers has been placed across the bi nanoline . from this",
    ", it can be determined that the nanoline occupies the space of _ four _ dimers . ]",
    "however , it was difficult to account for the extreme straightness of the nanoline with the miki model , as the calculated kinking energy was very small , around 0.1  ev .",
    "a kinetic argument was put forward , which suggested that there was a stronger preference for incoming bi dimers to line up at the end of the nanoline , and hence the nanoline would grow straight@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the diffusion constant of a bi surface dimer was high ( this diffusion was required for a kink to form in a miki model nanoline ) , and hence a line would remain straight once it had grown . despite this explanation , the issue of the straightness of the bi nanolines remained as a question mark over the miki model .",
    "subsequent room - temperature stm experiments@xcite proved decisively that the miki model could not be the structure of the bi nanoline , as it had the wrong registry with the surface . markers were placed on the surface of an image with the si dimers resolved , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : registry ] , and by counting across the nanoline , the width was determined definitively to be four dimers , and not three as in the miki model ; moreover the bi dimers lay _ between _ the si dimers of the substrate , not in the same position .",
    "( this registry has been confirmed by every other stm measurement made@xcite ) . on the basis of the new stm data , the naitoh model was proposed@xcite .",
    "again this model was tested by atomistic calculations ; a detailed study of the dimensions and simulated stm appearance@xcite showed that again the nanoline would appear dark in stm at low bias voltages , but showed also that the spacing of the bi dimers was too narrow , approximately 5 , which could not be reconciled with the spacing of 6.3  measured from stm .",
    "moreover , the energy was considerably worse than the miki model@xcite , and the kinking energy was still low .",
    "there was therefore no satisfactory structural model at this time .",
    "inspiration for the structural model of the bi nanoline arose from the structural model proposed for the b - type double - height step of as - terminated ge@xcite . at this step edge",
    ", bond rotation forms a pair of 5 and 7-membered rings of ge , capped with as , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : haikucartoon](a ) . while the haiku structure appears to be a complex reconstruction , in fact the construction from a cell containing two bi ad - dimers can be described schematically in two simple steps , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : haikucartoon](b)-(d ) .",
    "the first step is to rotate the second and third layer atoms underneath the bi ad - dimers , so that the si dimer atoms sink down into the surface .",
    "this creates the 5- and 7-membered rings also seen in the as / ge step structure .",
    "the central four atoms are then removed , and the two halves of the structure bonded together , thus creating the haiku structure .",
    "( n.b . this is not proposed as the formation mechanism , but is simply given as a means of understanding the substructure . ) a linescan of the nanoline has been matched to the haiku model , using the background si dimers as reference marks@xcite .",

    "dft calculations of this new structure@xcite found that it was considerably more stable than the miki model , which has been confirmed by subsequent modelling@xcite .",
    "although the haiku structure shares several structural features with previous models  the top of the structure has two bi dimers joined by rebonded second - layer si atoms , as in the miki model , while on the outside of the bi dimers , there are more rebonded si atoms , just as in the naitoh model ",
    "the difference lies in the si substructure ; this mixture of 5 and 7-membered rings extends down many layers .",
    "consideration of the core of the nanoline reveals that it is a small triangular section of hexagonal silicon , embedded in the diamond cubic silicon substrate , rather like the `` endotaxial '' re nanowires mentioned in section  [ sec : formation - structure ] .",
    "the \\{111 } planes that delineate the core are shown in red in fig .",

    "has been studied in some detail@xcite , and again the nanoline becomes dark in low - bias images  this effect is a property of the bi dimers rather than that of the nanoline .",
    "low - bias stm images reveal other electronic effects , which provide further confirmation of the haiku structure , while ruling out the miki structure .",
    "these features are discussed below in section  [ sec : electronic - structure ] .",
    "however , despite the wealth of agreement of the predictions from the haiku model with experimental evidence , there has been no direct confirmation of the haiku structure .",
    "the bi nanolines are destroyed by exposure to air , while burial of the nanolines in a capping layer also changes their atomic structure@xcite ( though if done carefully the 1d character and dimerisation of the bi can be preserved ) , so that cross - sectional tem studies@xcite have not provided definitive confirmation of the core structure , and a recent x - ray standing wave(xsw ) study@xcite which relied upon capping with amorphous silicon and whose results cast doubt on the haiku model , can not be regarded as a counterindication .",
    "the difficulties of burial of the bi nanoline are discussed in section  [ sec : burial ] .",
    "we note also that a recent suggestion@xcite , that the height of the bi dimers in the haiku model is too far above the plane of the surface si dimers based on xpd@xcite , is not a significant piece of evidence against the haiku model : the xpd data was _ fitted _ to the miki model , thus naturally giving the wrong data for the haiku . if a fit of the data to the haiku model were to give height data which contradicted the atomistic modelling , then the model would have to be revisited .          despite the apparent success of the haiku model ,",
    "the miki model has continued to attract a large amount of attention@xcite as a possible candidate for the nanoline structure .",
    "while in fact its incorrect registry with the si substrate unambiguously rules it out as a candidate nanoline structure@xcite , it is an energetically favourable structure , and might be expected to be present on the bi - covered si(001 ) surface . with the benefit of hindsight , it can be seen that the miki structure was indeed observed in early stm images of the bi - rich surface .",

    "continued annealing of this surface will result in the desorption of the background bi forming a surface similar to that shown in fig.[fig : recipes](a ) , and eventually a surface similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : recipes](b ) is obtained .",
    "the second growth preparation route involves the deposition of bi onto the surface within the desorption temperature window . due to the lower surface coverage of bi , and the higher temperature ,",
    "a more ordered surface is obtained , and fewer , longer , bi nanolines form .",
    "the final surface is much the same , however , corresponding to that shown in fig.[fig : recipes](b ) .",
    "a high density of bi nanolines can be built up by continuous bi exposure for a long time , at a temperature in the upper half of the desorption window . in this regime , the nanolines are only stable for a few minutes in the absence of a bi flux and small differences in stability , such as the ends of a nanoline , will be significant .",
    "shorter nanolines , perpendicular to the prevailing direction , will tend to dissolve , so that a highly ordered surface with long , parallel nanolines is obtained , as in fig.[fig : recipes](c ) . by use of a vicinal surface , the preference for one domain can be enhanced further , and a surface close to a single - domain surface can be obtained , as in fig.[fig : recipes](d ) . a second method which produces a majority - domain surface , even on a surface without any intentional miscut , ( the miscut angle is @xmath12 ) @xcite , produces a surface as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcleanimage ] . in this case , a substrate temperature around 530@xmath3c was used , 4.5 ml of bi were deposited , with an anneal for around 40 mins .",
    "comparison of fig.[fig : recipes](d ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : mcleanimage ] reveals that in the former case , the nanolines are parallel to the prevailing step edges , while in the latter , they are perpendicular . despite the large difference in morphology ,",
    "the only differences between this recipe and that which produced fig.[fig : recipes](c , d ) are that continuous deposition for an extended period was not used , and the heating current used was ac , a strategy which was designed to reduce electromigration . whether this is is the cause of the majority - domain surface remains unclear , but such large - scale single - domain surfaces are ideal for nanoelectronics applications .",

    "annealing this surface above 500@xmath3c , or deposition of bi onto the clean surface above this threshold results in bi nanolines on a clean background .",
    "high coverages of nanolines are obtained by higher - temperature anneals , with longer bi exposure times . ]",
    "while stm can observe only a relatively small part of the surface , the large - scale order of the surface can be determined using electron diffraction methods such as rheed .",
    "a series of rheed patterns at different azimuthal angles of a single - domain bi nanoline surface are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rheed ] .",
    "perpendicular to the nanolines , the rheed pattern comprises vertical lines , while parallel to the nanolines , a ring feature is seen .",

    "in contrast to the silicide nanowires , which form very rapidly at the growth temperature and are only stable for about 10  mins . at that temperature , there is a significant incubation period before the nucleation of the bi nanolines , and they will continue to grow for upwards of an hour after the deposition of bi has finished . thus the bi required to generate the nanolines must come from a reservoir of bi which is present on the surface .",
    "where is this bi located , and how does it affect the growth of the nanolines ?    in images of the surface",
    "taken soon after the end of the bi deposition , for example , fig.[fig : recipes](a ) , there is often a high density of small islands on the surface .",
    "these islands have the same appearance as the rest of the surface ; they are not islands of bi dimers , as may be seen after deposition at lower temperatures , but appear to be mixtures of si and bi atoms . in general , such small islands",
    "are not stable at these temperatures , as has been seen in hot stm studies of si homoepitaxy on si(001)@xcite . during growth",
    ", these small islands are stabilised by the high flux of si atoms , but if the flux is cut off , a process similar to ostwald ripening occurs , in which these islands will decompose , and the material in them will move to step edges ( which may be regarded as a very large island ) .",
    "the similarity of the behaviour observed here suggests that these islands are sustained by a flux of si and bi , which is produced during bi deposition . for low coverages of bi , the lowest - energy sites for bi dimers which have substituted for si dimers in the top layer of the si(001 ) surface ",
    "hereafter `` bi surface dimers''are bi surface dimer / missing - si - dimer complexes@xcite , where a bi dimer decorates one or both sides of a 1dv , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : naitohmiki ] . for each adsorbed",
    "bi dimer , therefore , up to four si atoms are ejected from the surface layer , producing a significant transient flux of si atoms ; this flux in turn produces the observed islands . at the end of bi deposition , this flux will die away , the islands will no longer be stable and will decompose , as occurs between fig.[fig : promontory](a)and ( b ) . a cartoon of this process is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : reservoir](d ) .",
    "once the small islands have annealed away , the surface morphology is very flat , and the background between the nucleating bi nanolines appears featureless in hot stm , apart from missing dimer trenches .",
    "however , at this stage a large surface density of bi may be inferred from the fact that bi nanolines continue to nucleate and grow on this surface .",
    "the bi dimers embedded in the surface layer have approximately the same contrast as the si dimers@xcite , and are therefore invisible at elevated temperature , as in fig .",

    "after quenching the sample to room temperature , and exposure to hydrogen , we can judge the true coverage and distribution of bi during the annealing process , as displayed in fig .",

    "the ejected si atoms difffuse and form islands ( 3).[fig : reservoir ] ]    during the high - temperature anneal , the surface bi reservoir is continuously depleted , with some bi going to form nanolines , and the remainder evaporating back into vacuum .",
    "the activation barrier for evaporation is different for different surface adsorption sites .",
    "a rheed study@xcite found that the activation barrier for evaporation of bi from the nanoline was 0.25 ev higher than the barrier for evaporation of bi from a ( 2@xmath1n):bi overlayer .",
    "hence bi is mostly being lost from the background reservoir .",
    "however , it might be expected that missing dimers in the nanolines would be observed occasionally .",
    "in fact , this is not the case , and those nanolines which are observed at high temperatures always appear perfect .",
    "it is likely that , due to the large defect energy of the haiku structure ( 0.66  ev from dft calculations@xcite ) , any bi which evaporates from the nanoline is quickly replaced from the bi reservoir .",
    "thus at high temperatures , where bi can evaporate from the nanolines , their stability is dependent upon a sufficient quantity of bi in the reservoir to replace missing dimers . at the later stage of an anneal , no new bi nanolines nucleate , and those which are present cease to grow .",
    "this is an indication that the reservoir of bi is approaching exhaustion . finally , when the reservoir is exhausted , evaporation from the bi nanolines will take place , and they will disappear within a few scans , or sometimes within the time of one scan . a sequence showing the evaporation of nanolines",
    "is shown in fig.[fig : linebreakup ] .",
    "in general , the nanolines evaporate from the ends , rather than breaking up into pieces , which strongly suggests that the ends of nanolines are less stable than the middle of the nanoline , and that the energetic barrier to break the nanoline in the middle and create two ends is prohibitive , even at these temperatures .          the most notable feature of the mature nanoline surface as seen in fig .  [ fig : recipes](c ) and ( d ) as well as fig .",
    "[ fig : mcleanimage ] is known as the promontory .",
    "long , narrow islands of si surrounding bi nanolines grow out across lower terraces . a series of images showing the early stages of bi nanoline growth are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : promontory ] . in ( a )",
    ", a short nanoline has grown out over a lower terrace and the joining of the promontory and the pre - existing step edge has formed a hole in the upper terrace , as is marked in ( b ) .",
    "the growth of this promontory is blocked by the growth of a second nanoline , which has nucleated in the time interval between ( a ) and ( b ) , and is growing out across the next lower terrace .",
    "comparison of ( b),(c ) and ( d ) makes it it very clear that the promontories are the result of growth out over a lower step edge . by ( d ) , a common pattern of zigzagging bi nanolines which have blocked each other s growth is developing .",
    "the mechanism behind this promontory growth has not been determined ; in an early paper , it was suggested that the promontories form by etching of si around the bi nanolines@xcite .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "[ fig : promontory ] , there is no sign of etching taking place ; this is a pure growth phenomenon .",
    "it is likely that the growth of the nanoline is related to the high mobility of step edges at 500@xmath3c .",
    "nanolines will always continue to grow until they reach an obstacle .",
    "thus nanolines will stop at step edges .",
    "however , the position of the step edge at this temperature is not constant ; it fluctuates back and forth@xcite , as material moves randomly along it .",
    "this motion may be inferred from the jagged , streaky step edges in these high - temperature images , as discussed in section  [ sec : hot - stm ] .",
    "therefore , each time the step edge moves forwards , the nanoline can extend to the new step position , and then when the step edge tries to move back again , its position is pinned by the presence of the nanoline . with each forward fluctuation",
    "therefore , the nanoline will grow forward , and thus a promontory will gradually form .",
    "a similar process could explain the retreat of an up step ahead of a growing nanoline .",
    "the notable feature of the promontory is that they have a fixed minimum width .",
    "at least 3 - 4  nm of si is maintained on either side of the bi nanoline .",
    "this fixed width is an example of the phenomenon known as the defect exclusion zone , or `` dez '' , which is discussed in section  [ sec : dez - sub ] .",
    "since the nanoline has a strain field associated with it , it is likely to exhibit quite strong interactions with other surface features which exert a localised strain on the surface .",
    "such features might be adsorbed bi dimers , missing dimer defects , step edges , and other nanolines .        using tight - binding simulations ,",
    "where very large cells can be relaxed , the interaction between a nanoline and several features , such as 1dv defects and rebonded b - type step edges have been calculated .",
    "these data are plotted in fig.[fig : deznewfig ] . from elevated - temperature stm images , it is clear that there is a repulsive interaction between the nanolines and missing dimer defects and step edges . at high temperature , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : deznewfig ] , the surface is covered in black streaks , which indicate the positions of rapidly moving missing dimer defects .",
    "however , either side of the nanoline , there are no streaks . likewise , where a nanoline forms a promontory , the width of this empty area is continued as the width of the promontory .",
    "this characteristic width of defect - free silicon , around 3 - 4  nm either side of the nanoline , is known as the `` defect exclusion zone '' or dez @xcite . for a large separation ,",
    "the total energy of a nanoline and a defect is the same as for the two structures independently .",
    "however , as the separation decreases , the total energy increases , so that at a distance of about 3.5 nm , there is a repulsive interaction between the nanolines of ca . 0.1 ev for both step edges and 1dvs , and at smaller distances , this energy increases rapidly .",
    "statistics about the position of 1dvs in the space between two nanolines have been gathered , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : deznewfig ] , taken from ref .",
    "they show that on average , most defects occur at least 3.2 nm away from the nanoline , which is in agreement with the calculated repulsion .    for a pair of nanolines",
    ", there is a similar interaction , and the 0.1 ev threshold is also reached when the centres of the two nanolines are about 3.5 nm apart , or in other words , the gap between the nanolines is the width of one nanoline .",
    "clusters of nanolines with this approximate spacing are often seen , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : deznewfig ] . for nanolines adjacent to each other",
    ", the excess energy is about 1 ev per unit cell . despite this , nanolines are sometimes observed growing next to each other , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : recipes](c ) .",
    "the reason for this is that unlike defects and step edges , which are mobile , a nanoline can not move sideways .",
    "hence when two nanolines which have nucleated in different places grow past each other , they can not move sideways to reduce their interaction energy .",
    "the presence of nanolines in close proximity does indicate that this interaction energy is not so high as to present an insuperable barrier to the growth of two nanolines past each other . for bi surface dimers , which have a compressive stress field , decoration of missing dimer trenches",
    "is a natural way in which to relieve their stress .",
    "the gain in energy by this process is about 0.45 ev / bi dimer in tightbinding calculations@xcite .",
    "the interaction with the nanoline is also attractive . in images where there is a large surface density of bi dimers , they are often situated adjacent to the nanolines .",
    "this position is found to be 0.28 ev better in energy@xcite than elsewhere .",
    "this suggests that the nanolines are generally more stable in a surface with a significant amount of compressive stress , such as one which is covered in bi .",

    "this distortion in turn causes the states near the fermi level on the neighbouring dimers to move towards the fermi level , leading to a brightening or enhancement at low biases .",
    "low - bias simulated images of the naitoh and miki structures@xcite show that the si dimers adjacent to the naitoh become _ darker _ than the surrounding si dimers as the fermi level is approached , while those on the miki model are unchanged .",

    "a comparison of high and low - bias simulated images of the 3 structures are shown in fig .",

    "however , the prediction from the miki model does agree very well with the appearance suggested from stm images@xcite , in which the shoulder dimers around a 1dv on a bi - rich surface become dark at low bias voltages . on the basis of these calculations",

    "the localisation of the states close to the fermi level in the top few surface layers shows the strain induced by dimerisation . in the haiku structure , these states are even more strongly localised on the dimers immediately adjacent to the haiku structure , which causes their relative enhancement in stm .",
    "meanwhile the triangular si substructure of the haiku , c.f fig .",
    "[ fig : haikucore ] , is somewhat relaxed compared to the clean si dimers , although it is strained relative to the hydrogenated dimers and perfect bulk si . this goes some way to explaining the stability of the subsurface 5 - 7 - 5 ring structures , which serve as a highly effective relief mechanism for the epitaxial stress exerted by adsorbed bi .",
    "the absence of states close to the fermi level suggests that the nanolines are likely to block surface conduction perpendicular to the nanoline , and are not likely to act as a nanowire .",
    "the lack of any states on the bi near the fermi level is clearly the cause of the darkening of the nanoline relative to the si(001 ) surface seen in stm at low voltages . in the full charge densities(fig .",
    "[ fig : ldos](iv ) ) , the density of states associated with the bi dimers , combined with their higher physical height , explains their relative brightness in stm at higher bias voltages . in the case of the hydrogenated surface ,",
    "the bi dimers have a similar charge density as in the clean surface , but in this case , the si @xmath22-bonds have been eliminated , so the bi dimer remains bright in stm at all biases@xcite .",
    "as described above in more detail , the bonding orbitals in the bi dimers have essentially a p@xmath23 bonding character , while the lone pair is a diffuse s - type orbital , some 10 ev below the fermi level@xcite .",
    "thus the bi dimer is in a very stable electronic state , and is not expected to be very reactive .",
    "moreover , this low - energy configuration is dependent upon the maintenance of bond angles close to 90@xmath3 , which will have an effect on the energetics of any insertion into the bi - bi dimer bond .",
    "however , the low - bias images shown above reveal that although the nanoline appears clean at high biases , some contrast between different dimers is visible at lower biases , suggesting that some chemical attack has occurred .",
    "we have proposed that the bi nanolines , although semiconducting themselves , might be used as templates for deposition of other materials , such as metals , active molecules , nanoparticles etc.@xcite . in order for the nanoline to have utility in this role",
    ", it must be possible to mask the substrate around the nanoline , so that adsorbants stick preferentially to the nanoline .",
    "it is also important , for any nano - electronics applications , to have some method for rendering the substrate insulating after growth of the nanoline .",
    "the chemical reactivity of the bi dimers , and the nanoline as a whole , is therefore crucial to any implementation of this concept .",
    "atomic hydrogen has been used as a mask on the bare si(001 ) surface for stm lithography experiments@xcite , in which an stm tip is used to remove lines or areas of hydrogen from the surface , and thus provide areas onto which metal will adsorb , as in fig .",

    "however , the writing process is slow , and lacks scalability .",
    "use of the bi nanolines as templates would remove the need for this writing , while providing long , and more uniform patterns .",
    "hydrogen is therefore a natural species to use as a mask around a bi nanoline .",
    "one of the most favourable properties of silicon as an electronics material is the high quality of its oxide film .",
    "oxidation of the silicon around the bi nanoline is therefore a natural way in which to isolate the nanoline electrically from the substrate .",
    "the usual method of oxidation of silicon is by exposure to molecular oxygen or to water at elevated temperatures , but this only gives microelectronics - quality oxide when grown at ca.800@xmath3c . since the bi nanoline is not stable above 600@xmath3c , ozone was considered as an alternative for low - temperature oxidation .",
    "ozone preferentially attacks the backbonds of the surface si dimers , forming a stable oxide , even at room temperature@xcite .",
    "more recently , the need for high - k dielectrics has driven the development of silicon nitride and oxynitride as alternatives to silicon dioxide .",
    "nitridation is usually done using ammonia , which breaks up on contact with the clean silicon surface above 200 k@xcite . as an added bonus ,",
    "when ammonia reacts with silicon , the nitrogen moves below the surface , but the hydrogen remains on the surface , passivating it .",
    "it can therefore play a dual role , as insulating reagent , and as masking material .",
    "the reaction of these species with the bi nanoline are discussed in the sections below .",
    "the bi nanoline has been shown to be almost completely inert to attack by atomic hydrogen@xcite .",

    "thus each si - h dimer is resolved as a pair of dots .",
    "some white dots on the si surface may be holes in the monohydride layer , stray bismuth atoms , or adsorbed -oh resulting from water impurity in the hydrogen .",
    "while the nanoline is almost completely unreacted , one dimer has become dark .",

    "the preferential adsorption of the h onto the si is consistent with dft - lda modelling , which found that h on a bi dimer is 3  ev worse than h on a si dimer .",

    "moreover , the stoichiometry of the oxide formed on the bi / si(001 ) surface is closer to sio@xmath11 , which would imply better insulating properties .",
    "semiempirical calculations found that insertion of oxygen into the bi - bi bond is energetically much less favourable than for sb or as ( 0.32 ev vs ca .",

    "the surface was exposed to ozone at room temperature and , for comparison , to molecular oxygen at 400@xmath3c .",
    "both surfaces were annealed up to 570@xmath3c , near the stability limit of the bi nanoline .",
    "the room - temperature ozone experiments , using exposures up to 20 l of o@xmath26 , revealed that the silicon background could be saturated without visible damage to the nanoline . in large - scale images , the bi nanoline appears to be completely unaffected , as shown in fig .",

    "annealing this surface introduced some defects into the nanoline .",
    "after annealing at 450@xmath3c , gaps appear in the nanoline , which comprise 1 - 2 unit cells .",

    "the small contrast changes , which were seen after ozone exposure at room temperature may therefore indicate reaction with bi - si , or si - si backbonds around the nanoline , so making that unit cell more susceptible to evaporation during high - temperature annealing .",
    "molecular oxygen , when adsorbed at 400@xmath3c , behaved in a very similar way to ozone .",
    "again there was preferential attack of the silicon , leaving the nanoline mostly intact , but also gaps appeared in the bi nanoline after annealing for about one hour@xcite .",

    "furthermore , the presence of a significant quantity of bi at the growth surface may have an effect on the results obtained , unless it is removed@xcite .",
    "we have given a broad overview of the different material systems and experimental methods which result in self - assembled 1d nanostructures on semiconductor surfaces , particularly the technologically important si(001 ) surface .",

    "even so , while many different rare earths superficially appear to behave in a similar fashion , review of the literature indicates that in fact several different nucleation and growth mechanisms are responsible for the formation of nanowires within this family , both kinetic and thermodynamic .",
    "the recent observation of nanowires with an orthorhombic crystal structure@xcite , rather than the hexagonal structure previously reported , suggests that there is much more to be learnt about this family of materials .",

    "the formation mechanism of this core structure remains unknown .",
    "a significant activation barrier is expected , given the high temperature and long incubation time required to form the nanolines , and the co - existence of the nanolines with the miki structure , which is less stable , but kinetically easy to form . while mechanisms proposed thus far have concentrated on the twisting of pairs of atoms , an alternative may well be a stacking - fault - like shift of the entire core from the cubic phase to the hexagonal phase .",
    "given their structure , it is clear that the bi nanolines are not a conventional heteroepitaxial system like the silicide family .",
    "there is no variation in width , either with annealing temperature or time  only the number density of nanolines and the length changes with further deposition and annealing .",
    "the nanolines are only ever one unit cell wide , although clusters of nanolines are sometimes seen .",

    "the chemical properties of the nanoline stem from the behaviour of the bi dimer with its preference for p@xmath23 bonding and an inert s - type lone pair , rather than the sp@xmath23 hybridization of si dimers .",
    "although the bi - bi bond is weak , it is also passive , and only in shows any significant reaction with it , probably because the zigzag structure produced allows the bi atoms to retain their preferred 90@xmath3 bond angles .",

    "the method of tightbinding has proved to be a valuable tool for quickly searching through a large variety of possible structures , as in for instance the haiku structure , or for relaxing a large number of atoms , as in modelling of the nanoline kink energies . at the same time",
    ", the tightbinding method retains a quantum mechanical description of the energetics , so that the calculated energies are in most cases in reasonable agreement with those calculated using dft .",
    "the bi nanoline has benefitted from an unusual degree of theoretical investigation .",
    "a similar level of theoretical work for the rare - earth nanowires is likely to deepen greatly the understanding of the different nucleation and growth phenomena that have been identified in that family of systems .    with a significant body of work devoted to the fabrication and structure of the nanoline systems , attention",
    "should be paid to their possible applications .",
    "the length , straightness and perfection of self - assembled nanolines lend themselves to use as a nanoscale template .",
    "the most obvious candidate systems are the rare - earth nanowires , which are themselves metallic , so that an array of parallel nanowires would readily form the contacts for a nanoelectronic device , perhaps using the `` crossbar '' architecture .",
    "the er silicides appear also to act as preferential adsorption sites for metals such as pt , so that the properties of these contacts is not limited to that of the nanowires themselves .",
    "however , the growth of these nanowires on a semiconducting substrate , with no indication as yet that the substrate could subsequently be oxidised , might limit their application in nanoelectronics ( for which a high - quality insulating substrate is crucial ) . for the bi nanolines ,",
    "oxidation of the surrounding silicon with ozone , followed by passivation of the surface with hydrogen , or nitridation using ammonia , is a plausible route for the fabrication of a single - nm 1d template on an insulating surface , considerably smaller than any of the rare - earth nanowires , and well within the size range where quantum scale effects might be expected to occur . by the deposition of metals , active molecules , nanoparticles , or other species onto this template , the fabrication of nanowires , or arrays of nanoparticles with interesting optical , electronic or magnetic properties could be achieved , with atomic precision .",

    "<S> a number of different families of nanowires which self - assemble on semiconductor surfaces have been identified in recent years . </S>",
    "<S> they are particularly interesting from the standpoint of nanoelectronics , which seeks non - lithographic ways of creating interconnects at the nanometre scale ( though possibly for carrying signal rather than current ) , as well as from the standpoint of traditional materials science and surface science . </S>",
    "<S> we survey these families and consider their physical and electronic structure , as well as their formation and reactivity . </S>",
    "<S> particular attention is paid to rare earth nanowires and the bi nanoline , both of which self - assemble on si(001 ) . </S>"
