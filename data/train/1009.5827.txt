    "superfluidity is a property of quantum fluids related with the existence of low energy excitations that satisfy the landau s criterion for superfluidity  @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the dispersion law of the excitations .",
    "the main property of superfluids is that they have an extremely small viscosity and can flow with very small friction .    in general , superfluidity is due to the appearance of a condensate which spontaneously breaks a global symmetry of the system . as a consequence , in the low energy spectrum",
    "one has a nambu - goldstone boson , @xmath2 , whose dispersion law satisfies eq .",
    "( [ landau - criterion ] ) .",
    "superfluidity was first discovered in @xmath3he , which becomes superfluid when cooled at temperatures below @xmath4 k. the superfluid property of @xmath3he atoms is due to the fact that they are bosonic with very small interactions .",
    "therefore at low enough temperature they bose - einstein condense in the lowest quantum state .",
    "fermionic systems can become superfluid as well . according with the cooper theorem , fermionic superfluidity takes place in quantum degenerate systems",
    "when the interaction between neutral fermions is attractive and the temperature is sufficiently low . in this case one has the formation of di - fermion condensates , or cooper pairs , that behave as bosonic particle and can condense .",
    "also in this case superfluidity is accompanied with the spontaneous breaking of a global @xmath5 symmetry and with the appearance of a goldstone boson .",
    "fermionic superfluids might be present in the interior of neutron stars where the temperature is low and the typical energy scale of particles is extremely high . in particular , in the inner crust of neutron",
    "stars the attractive interaction between neutrons can lead to the formation of a bcs condensate .",
    "moreover , if deconfined quark matter is present in the core of neutron stars it is very likely to be in a color superconducting phase  @xcite .",
    "a means to detect or to discard the presence of a superfluid phase in compact stars consists in studying the evolution of the r - mode oscillations  @xcite .",
    "r - modes are non - radial oscillations of the star with the coriolis force acting as the restoring force .",
    "they provide a severe limitation on the rotation frequency of the star through coupling to gravitational radiation .",
    "when dissipative phenomena damp these r - modes the star can rotate without losing angular momentum to gravitational radiation .",
    "if dissipative phenomena are not strong enough , these oscillations will grow exponentially and the star will keep slowing down until some dissipation mechanism is able to damp the r - mode oscillations . in this way one can put some constrains on the stellar structure ruling out phases that do not have large enough viscosity . for such studies",
    "it is necessary to consider in detail all the dissipative processes .",
    "the transport properties of a superfluid depend on the shear viscosity coefficient , @xmath6 , on independent bulk viscosity coefficients , @xmath7 , and on the thermal conductivity @xmath8 .",
    "microscopically , these coefficients are related with interactions that take place in the superfluid .",
    "macroscopically , they can be viewed as the phenomenological coefficients which relate the rate of change of currents with the corresponding affinities  @xcite .",
    "the requirement that the dissipative processes lead to positive entropy production imposes some constraint on these coefficients : @xmath9 must be positive and @xmath10 .",
    "the presence of three different bulk viscosity coefficients might sound puzzling .",
    "it is related with the fact that the hydrodynamic equations governing a superfluid are essentially different from standard fluid equations . in a superfluid",
    "there are two independent motions , one normal and the other superfluid .",
    "while the coefficient @xmath11 plays the role of the standard bulk viscosity coefficient , the coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath13 provide a coupling between the normal and superfluid components .",
    "the friction forces due to bulk viscosities can be understood as drops , with respect to their equilibrium values , in the main driving forces acting on the normal and superfluid components .",
    "these forces are given by the gradients of the pressure @xmath14 and of the chemical potential @xmath15 .",
    "one can write in the comoving frame @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the equilibrium pressure and chemical potential , @xmath19 is a quantity proportional to the quantum condensate , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the velocity of the fluid .    in a conformally invariant system",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath22 .",
    "however , @xmath13 , @xmath8 and @xmath6 can not be determined by the same symmetry argument .    in the low temperature regime , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the critical temperature for superfluidity ,",
    "the transport properties of superfluids are determined by phonons .",
    "the contribution of other degrees of freedom is thermally suppressed . in this case",
    "one can show that @xmath25 , meaning that there are only two independent bulk viscosity coefficients .",
    "for @xmath23 the transport coefficients strongly depend on the phonon dispersion law .",
    "the shear viscosity is the only transport coefficient that does not vanish for phonons with a linear dispersion law .",
    "but , for the bulk viscosities and for the thermal conductivity one has to include the term cubic in momentum @xmath26 moreover , in the computation of the bulk viscosity one has to consider the processes that change the number of phonons .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 determines whether some processes are or are not kinematically allowed . for @xmath28",
    "the leading contribution comes from the beliaev process @xmath29 . in the opposite case",
    "the beliaev process is not kinematically allowed and one has to consider the processes @xmath30 .",
    "a different dissipative process is associated with the change in the number densities of the various species present in the superfluid , which leads to the appearance of the so - called rocket term in the euler equations of the system .",
    "this force is due to the fact that when two or more fluids move with different velocities a change of one component into the other results in a momentum transfer between the fluids .",
    "this change in momentum is not reversible , because it is always the faster moving fluid that will lose momentum .",
    "the resulting dissipative force is proportional to the mass rate change , and to the relative velocity of the fluids .",
    "the name  rocket term \" reminds that the same phenomenon takes place in the dynamical evolution of a rocket whose mass is changing in time as it consumes its fuel . in compact stars number",
    "changing processes can take place in the outer core and in the inner crust of the star and are related to the urca processes and/or interactions between the superfluid and the crust .",
    "the dissipative force due to the rocket term has been considered in the context of r - mode oscillations of standard @xmath31 neutron stars , for the first time in ref .",
    "quantum chromodynamics predicts that at asymptotically high densities quark matter is in the color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase  @xcite . in this phase up , down and strange quarks of all three colors pair forming a di - fermion condensate that breaks the @xmath32 symmetry spontaneously .    at asymptotic densities ,",
    "the dispersion law of phonons in the cfl phase has been derived in  @xcite , and one has that @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the gap parameter .",
    "the effect of the quark masses can be taken into account perturbatively , as far as @xmath36 , moreover the coupling constant is small , @xmath37 , and one can assume that cfl is approximately scale invariant .",
    "a first study of the shear viscosity and of the contribution to the bulk viscosity coefficients due to phonons has been presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . beside phonons",
    ", kaons may give a sizable contribution to the transport coefficients .",
    "the contribution of kaons to @xmath11 has been studied in ref .",
    "there is still no computation of the contribution of kaons to the remaining bulk viscosity coefficients .    considering only the contribution of phonons , in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been found that neglecting the running of the qcd gauge coupling @xmath38 notice that for vanishing quark masses the system is scale invariant and @xmath12 and @xmath11 vanish .    the contribution to thermal conductivity due to phonons and kaons",
    "has recently been studied in ref .",
    "the thermal conductivity from phonons turns out to be dominant and given by @xmath39 whereas the shear viscosity from phonons as determined in  @xcite is given by @xmath40    a different dissipative mechanism is due to mutual friction , that has been studied in the cfl phase in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "for a system consisting of neutrons , protons and electrons , the mass conservation law is given by , see _",
    "e.g. _  @xcite , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the particle mass creation rate per unit volume and the index @xmath43 refer to the particle species , that is , neutrons , protons and electrons . in these equations",
    "we have considered that some process can convert neutrons in protons and electrons and _ vice versa_. therefore , we are assuming that the various components are not separately conserved .",
    "one possible mechanism leading to a change in the particle number densities is given by the urca process @xmath44    a different process is the _ crust - core transfusion _ , a process that takes place when the ionic constituent of the crust are squeezed by the underlying superfluid and part of their content is released and augments the superfluid component . the opposite mechanism , related to a reduction of the pressure leads to the neutron capture by the ions of the crust .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the beta decay processes .",
    "it is possible to simplify the treatment of the system considering that electrons and protons are locked together by the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "thus they move with the same velocity .",
    "moreover , charge neutrality implies that @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , electrons and protons can be treated as a single charge - neutral fluid and henceforth we shall refer to this fluid as the `` charged '' component .",
    "the two fluids have mass densities @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the euler equations obeyed by the two fluids are given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the gravitational potential , @xmath52 label the space components ; we have defined a chemical potential by mass @xmath53 , and @xmath54 represents the relative velocity between the two fluids .",
    "the quantities @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the entrainment parameters , that are related to the fact that momenta and velocities of quasiparticles may not be aligned  @xcite .",
    "the term on the right hand side of eq .  ( [ eul - proton ] ) is the rocket term . in the analysis of the possible dissipative mechanisms of star oscillations this term",
    "is usually neglected .",
    "indeed , it is in general assumed that the neutron , proton and electron numbers are separately conserved quantities , that is @xmath57 . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have considered the effect of this term and obtained the corresponding damping timescale , assuming that the change in the number densities is due to direct urca processes .      , with radius",
    "@xmath58 km and mass @xmath59 .",
    "the dashed red line represents the instability window in the absence of the rocket term .",
    "the full blue line represents the instability window with the inclusion of the rocket term .",
    "the horizontal full lines correspond to the effect of the mutual friction for @xmath60 , lower line , and @xmath61 upper line . in our simplified model of star ,",
    "the mutual friction is independent of the temperature . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : instability ] we report the result for the superfluid r - mode  instability window \" for a star with uniform density , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 km .",
    "it is obtained comparing the various dissipative timescales with the growth timescale of gravitational wave radiation .",
    "stars above the various lines are unstable .",
    "the dashed red line represents the instability window in the absence of the rocket term .",
    "the region above the dashed red line is unstable when only shear and bulk viscosity damping are considered . at low temperature ,",
    "shear viscosity is the dominant dissipative mechanism . with increasing temperature",
    "shear viscosity is less efficient and it can damp r - mode oscillations for smaller and smaller values of the frequency . the behavior of bulk viscosity is the opposite and starts to damp r - mode oscillations for temperatures of the order of @xmath64 k. the full blue line represents the effect of the rocket term .",
    "it has a behavior qualitatively similar to the bulk viscosity , but it becomes effective at smaller temperatures .",
    "therefore , the instability window with the inclusion of the rocket term is much reduced .",
    "the full horizontal lines correspond to the effect of mutual friction , see e.g.  @xcite , for two different values of the entrainment parameter .",
