    "moreover , the coupling described by the hamiltonian @xmath12 of the lsps to electron - hole pairs ( with hamiltonian @xmath13 ) in each of the nanoparticles leads to the size - dependent landau damping of the collective modes @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of our system hence reads @xmath14     dimers , comprised of a pair of metallic nanoparticles denoted @xmath2 and @xmath3 , each supporting localized surface plasmon resonances . ]    since the nanoparticles we consider are small enough to be subject to quantum - size effects @xcite , and to elucidate the connection to fermionic quasiparticles in dirac materials , we quantize the classical plasmonic hamiltonian @xmath9 @xcite in the coulomb gauge @xcite , leading to @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an index which denotes the dimer number in the chain ( see fig .",

    "the factor @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) accounts for the repulsive ( attractive ) interaction between transverse ( longitudinal ) nearest neighbor lsps .",

    "secondly , the analogue of the hopping terms in eq .  , namely those @xmath34 and @xmath35 , are due to the nearest neighbor dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "the dipolar interaction gives rise to the coupling constants @xmath36 which alternate along the chain .",
    "however , this is where the comparison to a standard tight - binding model ends , due to the appearance of nonresonant terms @xmath37 and @xmath38 which enter the hamiltonian and are also due to the dipolar interaction .",

    "one notices an immediate analogy to the energy bands in a peierls chain @xcite , as the dimerization has the effect of opening up a small gap of the order of @xmath79 at the edges of the first brillouin zone ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the longitudinal collective plasmon mode has a gap which is about twice as large as compared to the transverse modes because the attractive interaction between pairs of dipoles parallel to the chain is twice as much as between dipoles perpendicular to the chain which experience a repulsive interaction [ cf .",

    "we further comment on the experimental setups required to observe the aforementioned tunneling effect .    to analyze the physics occurring at the edge of the brillouin zone , we taylor - expand the plasmon dispersion in the vicinity of @xmath82 , with @xmath83 . in the regime @xmath84 , we find that the collective excitations are governed by a pseudo - relativistic spectrum @xmath85 which is reminiscent of the spectrum of massive dirac particles , @xmath86 , where @xmath87 distinguishes the electron and positron particle species , and @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the momentum and mass of the particle , respectively .",

    "the index @xmath96 denotes whether the excitation can be thought of ( in the language of semiconductor physics ) as hole - like ( @xmath103 ) or electron - like ( @xmath104 ) , as is the case with the spinor of graphene @xcite .    for the dirac - like nature of the hamiltonian to become apparent ,",

    "the parallels with the 1d form of the dirac hamiltonian @xmath112 are evident , up to the unimportant constant energy shift @xmath113 .",
    "a striking feature in the effective hamiltonian is that the role of the mass term in a typical dirac hamiltonian is played by a quantity @xmath114 which can be modified in both magnitude and sign through the interparticle distances @xmath115 and @xmath116 [ see eq .  ] .",
    "this tunability has significant implications for both pseudo - relativistic klein tunneling ( see appendix [ appendb ] ) and the topological properties of bipartite metallic nanoparticle chains ( cf .  sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] ) .",
    "the present realization of 1d dirac - like bosons encapsulated in the hamiltonian complements the recent discovery of their counterparts in 2d honeycomb metasurfaces @xcite .",
    "a prominent feature of excitations described by a dirac equation is their ability to be transmitted through a potential barrier with highly suppressed backscattering @xcite , the so - called klein paradox . for the system of nanoparticles we investigate here , a plasmonic version of klein tunneling",
    "can be realized by arranging a dimerized chain into two distinct sections , which we distinguish with the notation @xmath117 ( for left ) and @xmath118 ( for right ) .",
    "these two sections have different resonance frequencies @xmath119 to mimic the application of an electrostatic potential step , as can be inferred from the first term in the right - hand side of the dirac - like hamiltonian ( see appendix [ appendb ] for a detailed calculation of the corresponding transmission probability ) .",
    "such a scenario may be experimentally achieved by the three following different means : ( i ) using two different metals ( for example silver and gold ) ; ( ii ) modifying the electrostatic environment of one chain with respect to the other , using an embedding dielectric medium ; or ( iii ) using nanoparticles of different sizes , for which quantum - size effects such as the spill - out of the electronic density outside the nanoparticle @xcite as well as coupling to the electronic environment @xcite influence the position of the surface plasmon resonance .",
    "the appearance of a dirac equation with its associated spinor wavefunctions in the description of the collective plasmons in the dimerized chain ( see sec .  [ sec4 ] ) indicates that a nontrivial berry phase may arise in this system . in this section",
    "we study the implications of such physics on bosonic quasiparticles , classify the topological properties which are found to arise and investigate the existence of edge and soliton - like states . as a result",
    ", we uncover our system as a ` plasmonic topological insulator ' , which has the ability to both harbor and exploit topologically - protected midgap states .",
    "the berry phase @xcite when applied to the dynamics of electrons in periodic solids in 1d is known as the zak phase @xcite .",
    "the latter is connected to a @xmath120 topological invariant , which characterizes exotic properties such as fermionic charge fractionalization @xcite . for our purposes here ,",
    "its utility arises because it is related to the existence of edge states , in a manifestation of a bulk - edge correspondence principle @xcite .",
    "the zak phase is defined as an integration over the first brillouin zone of the berry connection @xmath121 , explicitly @xmath122 which requires knowledge of the plasmonic eigenstates @xmath123 .",
    "we may write the plasmonic eigenstates via identification with the bogoliubov coefficients of eq .  , namely @xmath124 in the basis @xmath125 @xcite . then , proceeding to calculate the zak phase from eq .   with eq .  , we find @xmath126 defined modulo @xmath127 ( since the berry connection @xmath128 is not gauge invariant ) .",
    "thus the dimerized chain has a trivial zak phase @xmath129 when @xmath130 [ @xmath131 , cf .",

    "we now search for a midgap collective plasmon state at the frequency @xmath27 supported by the finite bipartite chain described by the hamiltonian and composed of an even number of nanoparticles ( for completeness , we consider in appendix [ appendd ] the case where the chain is composed of an odd number of constituants ) . to this end",

    "<S> we study a bipartite linear chain constituted by spherical metallic nanoparticles , where each nanoparticle supports a localized surface plasmon . </S>",

    "<S> we find the effective dirac hamiltonian for the collective plasmons and show that the corresponding spinor eigenstates represent one - dimensional dirac - like massive bosonic excitations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the plasmonic lattice exhibits similar effects to those found for electrons in one - dimensional dirac materials , such as the ability for transmission with highly suppressed backscattering due to klein tunnelling . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the system is governed by a nontrivial zak phase , which predicts the manifestation of edge states in the chain . when two dimerized chains with different topological phases are connected , we find the appearance of the bosonic version of a jackiw - rebbi midgap state . </S>",
