    "one of the most significant aim of all large redshift surveys is to determine the spatial distribution of galaxies in the universe . over the last few decades",
    "redshift surveys have revealed the large scale structures in the universe in it s full glory ( e.g. , cfa , @xcite ; lcrs , @xcite ; 2dfgrs , @xcite and sdss , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it is found that the vast majority of galaxies preferentially reside in an intricate network of interconnected filaments and walls surrounded by voids .",
    "the filaments have a dimension of many tens of mpc in length ( @xcite ) and 1 - 2 @xmath1 in thickness ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in fact the local group in which the milky way resides , is believed to lie along an extended filament that originates near the ursa major and includes both the ic342 and m81 groups and connects with another primary filament which originates from the virgo cluster and includes the sculpture group ( @xcite ) .",
    "the complex filamentary network of galaxies , the so called cosmic web is possibly the most striking visible feature in the large scale structure of the universe . quantifying the cosmic web and tracing it",
    "s origin has remained one of the central issues in cosmology .",
    "the analysis of filamentary patterns in the galaxy distribution has a long history dating back to a few papers in the mid - eighties by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more recently , extensive studies of the lcrs reveal a rich network of interconnected filaments surrounding voids ( eg . @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have compared the filamentarity in the lcrs galaxy distribution with @xmath2cdm dark matter n - body simulations to show that the two are consistent provided a mild galaxy bias is included .",
    "@xcite has used a technique surfgen ( @xcite ) to study the geometry , topology and morphology of the superclusters in mock sdss catalogues . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have studied the super - cluster void network in the pscz and the abell / aco cluster catalogue respectively , finding filamentarity to be the dominant feature . @xcite",
    "have studied the intercluster galaxy filaments in the 2dfgrs .    the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )",
    "@xcite is currently the largest galaxy redshift survey . in a recent paper @xcite we have analyzed the filamentarity in the two equatorial strips of the first data release of the sdss ( sdss dr1 ) .",
    "these strips are nearly two dimensional ( 2-d ) .",
    "we have projected the data onto a plane and analyzed the resulting 2-d galaxy distribution .",
    "the large volume and dense sampling of the sdss allows us to construct volume limited subsamples extending over lengthscales which are substantially larger than possible with earlier surveys .",
    "we find evidence for connectivity and filamentarity in excess of that of a random point distribution , indicating the existence of an interconnected network of filaments .",
    "the filamentarity is found to be statistically significant up to length - scales @xmath3 and not beyond @xcite .",
    "further , we show that the degree of filamentarity exhibits a luminosity dependence with the brighter galaxies having a more concentrated and less filamentary distribution .",
    "it is now quite well accepted that galaxies with different physical properties are differently distributed in space .",
    "studies over several decades have established that ellipticals and spirals are not distributed in the same way .",
    "the ellipticals are found predominantly inside regular , rich clusters whereas the field galaxies are mostly spirals .",
    "this effect is referred to as `` morphological segregation '' which has been studied extensively in the literature ( eg .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "further , ellipticals exhibit a stronger clustering as compared to spirals ( @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of the two - point correlation function of galaxies with different colours shows the red galaxies , which are mainly ellipticals with old stellar populations , to have a stronger clustering as compared to the blue galaxies which are mostly spirals ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "studies of the topology using the genus statistics show that red galaxies exhibit a shift towards a meatball topology ( @xcite , sdss edr , @xcite , sdss dr3 ) implying that they prefer to inhabit the high density environments .",
    "it is found that luminous galaxies exhibit a stronger clustering than their fainter counterparts ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the difference increase markedly above the characteristic magnitude @xmath4 ( @xcite , 2dfgrs , @xcite , sdss dr2 ) of the schecter luminosity function ( @xcite ) .",
    "the detailed luminosity dependence has been difficult to establish because of the limited dynamic range of even the largest redshift surveys .",
    "@xcite have studied the luminosity distribution of galaxies in high and low density regions of the sdss to show that brighter galaxies are preferentially distributed in the high density environments .",
    "@xcite have studied the morphology density relation in the sdss(edr ) and found that this relation is less noticeable in the sparsest regions indicating the need for a denser environment for fostering the physical mechanisms responsible for the galaxy morphological changes . @xcite and",
    "@xcite find a strong environment dependence for both the colour and luminosity for the sdss galaxies .",
    "the dependence of clustering on galaxy properties like the luminosity , colour and morphology provides very important inputs for theories of galaxy formation .",
    "it is a natural prediction of hierarchical structure formation that the rarer objects which correspond to peaks in the density field should be more strongly clustered than the population itself ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a possible interpretation of the observations is that the more luminous galaxies are hosted in higher density peaks as compared to the fainter galaxies . in this scenario",
    "the properties of a galaxy are largely decided by the initial conditions at the location where the galaxy is formed .",
    "this idea is implemented in the halo model ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) where it is postulated that all galaxies lie in virialised halos and the number and type of galaxies in a halo is entirely determined by the halo mass .",
    "@xcite provide a detailed review of the halo model .",
    "it is well known that galaxy - galaxy interactions and environmental effects are also important in determining the physical properties of a galaxy .",
    "for example , ram pressure stripping in galaxy clusters is a possible mechanism for the transformation of a spiral galaxy into an elliptical .",
    "galaxy - galaxy interactions could also provide a mechanism for morphological transformation . in",
    "the classical picture galaxies evolve in isolation and morphology is determined at birth , while in the hierarchical model galaxies have no fixed morphology and they can evolve depending on the nature of their mergers .",
    "a study of the spatial distribution of different kind of galaxies holds the potential to probe the factors responsible in determining galaxy luminosity , colour and morphology .",
    "much of the research on the luminosity , morphology and colour dependence of the galaxy distribution has focused either on the morphology segregation in clusters or has studied the behaviour of the two point correlation as a function of these galaxy properties .",
    "filaments are the largest known statistically significant coherent features . they have been shown to be statistically significant to scales as large as @xmath5 . in this paper we study the luminosity , colour and morphology dependence of filaments in the sloan digital sky survey data release four ( sdss dr4 ) .",
    "this allows us to study the distribution of different types of galaxies on the largest length - scales possible .",
    "such a study will enable us to estimate the length - scale over which the factors responsible for the galaxy segregation operate .",
    "while the two - point correlation function completely characterizes the statistical properties of a gaussian random field , it is well known that the galaxy distribution is significantly non - gaussian .",
    "in fact the presence of large - scale coherent features like filaments is a clear indication of non - gaussianity .",
    "there have been studies of how the three point correlation function depends on galaxy properties @xcite .",
    "while the first two papers do not find any statistically significant effects , @xcite find statistically significant colour and luminosity dependence .",
    "the present work studies how the largest known non - gaussian features , the filaments , depend on galaxy properties .",
    "this paper presents progress on many counts compared to our earlier work @xcite based on the sdss dr1 .",
    "the earlier work was restricted to single volume limited subsamples from each of the two equatorial strips .",
    "the absolute magnitude range was divided into two equal halves , and these were analyzed to test for a luminosity dependence in the filamentarity . for a statistically significant conclusion",
    "it is necessary to also estimate the cosmic variance ( sample to sample variation ) of the filamentarity which was done by bootstrap resampling .",
    "we found that the difference in filamentarity between the two magnitude bins was in excess of the fluctuations expected from cosmic variance , thereby establishing the statistical significance .",
    "the sdss dr4 covers a large contiguous region in the northern galactic cap with a few gaps still to be covered .",
    "the sdss has been carried out in overlapping strips of @xmath6 width oriented along great circles .",
    "since the detection of coherent large - scale features requires a completely sampled region with no gaps , we have extracted seven non - overlapping strips of width @xmath7 each .",
    "the volume corresponding to each strip is nearly two dimensional and we have collapsed the thickness and analysed the resulting 2-d galaxy distribution .",
    "the increased number of strips provide a better estimate of the cosmic variance leading to more robust conclusions .",
    "the analysis has been carried out on five overlapping bins in absolute magnitude .",
    "we have extracted separate volume limited subsamples corresponding to each magnitude bin and compared the filamentarity across them .",
    "the earlier analysis has been extended here to also consider the colour and morphology dependence , which has been tested in each of the volume limited subsamples .    here",
    "we would like to mention that the statistics that we are using to quantify the filamentarity is not absolute in the sense that it is sensitive to the volume and galaxy number density of the sample .",
    "it is thus only meaningful to compare different galaxy samples provided they have the same volume ( identical shape and size ) and number density .",
    "this is an important consideration when constructing the galaxy samples for which we test the luminosity , colour and morphology dependence .",
    "a brief outline of our paper follows .",
    "section 2 describes the data and section 3 the method of analysis .",
    "our results for the sdss data are presented in section 4 , in section 5 we compare our results with the predictions of a semi analytic model of galaxy formation and finally we present our conclusions in section 6 .    it may be noted that we have used a @xmath2cdm cosmological model with @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 throughout .",
    "the sdss is an imaging and spectroscopic survey of the sky ( @xcite ) in five photometric bandpasses , u , g , r , i , z with effective wavelengths of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively ( @xcite , @xcite ) to a limiting r band magnitude @xmath16 with @xmath17 completeness .",
    "a series of pipelines that perform astrometric calibration ( @xcite ) , photometric reduction ( @xcite ) and photometric calibration ( @xcite ) are used to process the imaging data and then objects are selected from the imaging data for spectroscopy . in the sdss dr4 ( @xcite )",
    "the imaging data covers 6670 @xmath18 of the sky whereas the spectroscopy covers a total area of 4783 @xmath18 .",
    "the spectroscopic data includes 673,280 spectra with approximately 480,000 galaxies , 64,000 quasars and 89,000 stars .",
    "the survey area covers a single contiguous region in the northern galactic cap and three non - contiguous region in the southern galactic cap .",
    "our analysis is restricted to the northern galactic cap region only .",
    "the samples analyzed here were obtained from the sdss dr4 skyserver .",
    "this is a web interface to the sdss data archive server .",
    "the sdss surveys the sky in overlapping stripes of width @xmath6 which form great circles on the sky .",
    "the stripes are most conveniently described using survey co - ordinates ( @xmath19 ) defined in @xcite .",
    "lines of constant @xmath20 are great circles aligned with the stripes and lines of constant @xmath21 are are small circles along the width of the stripes .",
    "each stripe is centered along a line of constant @xmath20 separated from the adjoining stripe by @xmath22 .",
    "we have downloaded data from seven overlapping stripes which form a nearly contiguous region shown in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "we have selected all objects identified as galaxies with extinction corrected r band petrosian magnitude @xmath23 over the redshift range @xmath24 .    the primary data is not contiguous and has a few gaps . since our analysis requires contiguous regions , we have extracted seven non - overlapping strips each of width @xmath25 in @xmath20 and spanning @xmath26 in @xmath21 ( figure [ fig:1 ] and table  1 ) .",
    "only galaxies with extinction corrected petrosian r band magnitude in the range @xmath27 were used . for each galaxy",
    "the absolute magnitude was computed using its redshift , apparent magnitude , k correction and reddening correction ( @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt a polynomial fit ( @xcite ) for the mean k - correction , @xmath28 .",
    "we construct volume limited sub - samples using the absolute magnitude bins listed in table  2 .",
    "the five overlapping absolute magnitude bins are referred to as `` bin 1 '' , `` bin 2 '' , ... `` bin 5 '' in order of increasing luminosity .",
    "each bin extends over a different redshift range .",
    "the thickness of the volume corresponding to each bin increases with redshift .",
    "we have extracted regions of uniform thickness @xmath29 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath7 at redshift @xmath30 , and for some bins it was necessary to discard the range @xmath31 where the thickness was less than @xmath29 .",
    "the redshift range which we use for final galaxy samples that were analyzed are shown in table  2 .",
    "the faintest luminosity bin has the smallest area ( table  2 ) , and the area of the other bins increases monotonically with luminosity .",
    "a smaller magnitude range was chosen for the faintest bin so as to ensure that it covers a reasonably large area while maintaining a number density comparable to the other bins .",
    "the galaxy number density is maximum for bin 2 ( table  2 ) which is centered at @xmath32 which has a value @xmath33 @xcite for the sdss .",
    "the number density falls for the other bins .",
    "the number of galaxies for all the strips in each bin are also tabulated in table  1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     studies using n - body simulations show that the statistics that we use to characterize the filamentarity in the galaxy distribution is sensitive to the number density as well as the shape and size of the volume of the sample .",
    "to test for luminosity dependence it is necessary to compare different luminosity bins which as seen in table  2 have different number densities and cover different areas . to ensure that these factors do not influence our results ,",
    "we extract regions of identical shape and size as bin 1 from the other bins and use these to test for luminosity dependence .",
    "tests using dark matter @xmath2cdm n - body simulations show that galaxy number density variations of @xmath34 do not produce statistically significant effect on the filamentarity ( figure [ fig:11 ] ) .",
    "we have discarded randomly chosen galaxies from bins 2 and 3 so as to make the galaxy number density of each strip of these bins exactly equal to the mean density of bin 1 .",
    "the galaxy number density of bin 4 is within @xmath35 of that of bin 1 while it is @xmath36 lower in bin 5 .",
    "since these are lower than bin 1 , and as they are within the permissible range of variation we do not dilute the galaxy number density in bins 4 and 5 .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] shows the galaxy distribution in two different luminosity bins drawn from the same strip .",
    "it is to be noted that the samples with reduced area and diluted galaxy number density are used only for testing luminosity dependence .",
    "we separately study the colour and morphology dependence in each of the magnitude bins listed in table  1 and table  2 .",
    "we do not compare the colour and morphology dependence across different luminosity bins .",
    "when testing for colour dependence in a fixed luminosity bin , all the galaxies ( table  1 ) in the entire area of the bin ( table  2 ) are classified as either red or blue galaxies . the galaxy @xmath37 colours",
    "are known to have a bimodal distribution @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we determine a value @xmath38 for the colour such that it divides each magnitude bin into equal number of red ( i.e. @xmath39 ) and blue ( i.e. @xmath40 ) galaxies . as a consequence",
    "the number density of red and blue galaxies in each luminosity bin are exactly equal and have a value half that of the density shown in table  2 .",
    "the value of @xmath38 varies slightly across the luminosity bins , and the values are listed in table  2 .",
    "it may be noted that @xcite finds that a color selection criteria @xmath41 ensures that the red galaxies are ellipticals with @xmath42 completeness .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows the distribution of red and blue galaxies in one of the subsamples .",
    "the morphological classification was carried out using the concentration index defined as @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the radii containing @xmath42 and @xmath46 of the petrosian flux respectively .",
    "this has been found to be one of the best parameter to classify galaxy morphology ( @xcite ) .",
    "ellipticals are expected to have a larger concentration indices than spirals .",
    "it was found that @xmath47 for a pure de - vaucouleurs profile ( @xcite ) while @xmath48 for a pure exponential profile ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite show that using a cutoff @xmath49 divides the sample into ellipticals and spirals at @xmath50 completeness . for each luminosity bin",
    "we have chosen a cutoff @xmath51 that partitions the galaxies into two equal halves , one predominantly ellipticals and the other spirals .",
    "the values of @xmath51 varies across luminosity bins and are listed in table  2 .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] shows the distribution of early and late type galaxies in one of the subsamples .",
    "finally we note that there is an incompleteness in the sdss survey arising from a restriction which prevents the redshift of two galaxies at a very small angular separation to be measured .",
    "this incompleteness is not expected to introduce a luminosity , colour or morphology dependence and hence we do not take this into account .",
    "each of the subsamples described in the previous subsection have a much greater ( 16 - 35 times ) linear dimension compared to their thickness and so can be reasonably treated as two dimensional .",
    "the 2d galaxy distribution was embedded in a @xmath52 2d rectangular grid .",
    "the galaxy distribution was represented as a set of 1s and 0s on a 2-d rectangular grid by assigning the values 1 and 0 to the filled and empty cells respectively .",
    "note that @xmath53 of the filled cells have 2 galaxies while the number is substantially smaller for 3 galaxies or more , and hence the 1s and 0s provide a fair representation of the galaxy distribution on the length - scales of interest .",
    "the grid cells which are beyond the boundaries of the survey were assigned a negative value in order to distinguish them from the empty cells within the survey area .",
    "the next step is to use an objective criteria to identify the coherent large - scale structures visible in the galaxy distribution .",
    "we use a `` friends - of - friends''(fof ) algorithm to identify interconnected regions of filled cells which we refer to as clusters . in this algorithm",
    "any two adjacent filled cells are referred to as friends .",
    "clusters are defined through the stipulation that any friend of my friend is my friend .",
    "the distribution of 1s on the grid is very sparse with only @xmath54 of the cells being filled .",
    "also , the filled cells are mostly isolated , and the clusters identified using fof , which contain only a few cells each , do not resemble the large - scale coherent structures seen in the sdss strips .",
    "it is necessary to coarse - grain the galaxy distribution so that the large scale structures may be objectively identified . in every iteration of coarse - graining",
    "we fill up all the empty cells adjacent to every filled cells ( i.e. cells at the 4 sides and 4 corners of a filled cell ) , causing every filled cell to grow fatter .",
    "the size of an isolated filled cell is @xmath55 after @xmath56 iterations of coarse - graining and for example it is @xmath57 after @xmath58 iterations .",
    "this causes clusters to grow , first because of the growth of filled cells , and then by the merger of adjacent clusters as they overlap .",
    "increasing the coarse - graining further induces the percolation transition when a large fraction of the clusters connect up into a single , multiply connected network of filaments encircling voids . as coarse - graining proceeds even further the network grows to some extent , and",
    "eventually the elements become very thick filling up the entire survey region washing away any visible pattern .",
    "the filling factor @xmath59 , defined as the fraction of cells within the survey area that are filled , _ ie .",
    "_ @xmath60 increases from @xmath61 0.01 to @xmath62 1 as the coarse - graining is increased .",
    "the filling factor is around @xmath63 after @xmath58 rounds of coarse - graining ( figure [ fig:5 ] ) .",
    "so as to not restrict our analysis to an arbitrarily chosen level of coarse - graining , we analyze the clusters identified in the pattern of 1s and 0s after each iteration of coarse - graining .",
    "earlier studies using the sdss dr1 @xcite show that the percolation transition occurs in the @xmath64 range @xmath65 .",
    "the geometry and topology of a two dimensional cluster can be described by the three minkowski functionals , namely its area @xmath66 , perimeter @xmath67 , and number of holes or genus @xmath68 .",
    "we have tested that the cluster area @xmath66 is proportional to the actual number of galaxies within the cluster boundary .",
    "this holds at each level of coarse - graining , with the proportionality constant increasing with coarse - graining .",
    "the ratio @xmath69 characterizes the thickness of the cluster , and @xmath67 the extent of its boundary .",
    "since the clusters are largely filamentary ( as we shall see later ) , we may interpret @xmath67 as an estimate of the length of the cluster .",
    "the ratio @xmath70 has dimensions of length and it is particularly significant after the onset of percolation @xcite as it characterizes the length of the cluster boundary per void .",
    "it is possible to quantify the shape of the cluster using a single 2d `` shapefinder '' statistic ( bharadwaj et al .",
    "2000 ) which is defined as the dimensionless ratio @xmath71    which by construction has values in the range @xmath72 .",
    "it can be verified that @xmath73 for an ideal filament which has a finite length and zero width , whereby it subtends no area ( @xmath74 ) but has a finite perimeter ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "it can be further checked that @xmath76 for a circular disk , and intermediate values of @xmath77 quantifies the degree of filamentarity with the value increasing as a cluster is deformed from a circular disk to a thin filament .",
    "the definition of @xmath77 needs to be modified when working on a rectangular grid of spacing @xmath78 .",
    "an ideal filament , represented on a grid , has the minimum possible width _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath78 , and its perimeter @xmath67 and area @xmath66 are related as @xmath79 . at the other extreme we have @xmath80 for a square shaped cluster on the grid .",
    "we introduce the 2d shapefinder statistic    @xmath81    to quantify the shape of clusters on a grid . by definition 0@xmath82 1 .",
    "@xmath77 quantifies the degree of filamentarity of the cluster , with @xmath77 = 1 indicating a filament and @xmath77 = 0 , a square , and @xmath77 changes from @xmath83 to @xmath84 as a square is deformed to a filament .    at every stage of coarse - graining",
    "we have a number of clusters , each of which is characterized by its shape @xmath85 and size @xmath86 .",
    "it is desirable to identify a single statistical quantity to capture the filamentarity of the entire set of clusters .",
    "we have considered two possibilities @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively the first and second area weighted moments of the filamentarity .",
    "our aim being to quantitatively compare the filamentarity of different galaxy samples and draw statistically significant conclusions , we find that it is more advantageous to use @xmath88 as a statistical discriminator . though both @xmath87 and @xmath88 show similar behaviour , the differences in @xmath88 between point distributions with different clustering properties is more pronounced as compared to @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "the average filamentarity @xmath88 is defined as the mean filamentarity of all the clusters in a slice weighted by the square of the area of each clusters    @xmath89    in the current analysis , we study the average filamentarity @xmath88 as a function of @xmath64 to quantify the degree of filamentarity in each of the sdss subsamples and investigate how the average filamentarity @xmath88 changes with intrinsic galaxy properties like luminosity , color and morphology .",
    "we also use the area weighted second moment ( defined analogous to eq . ( [ eq : a6 ] ) ) of @xmath90 , @xmath67 and @xmath70 to quantify the average cluster thickness , length and length per void respectively .    at a specified level of coarse - graining the value of the filling factor ( @xmath64 )",
    "has small differences from sample to sample as seen in figure [ fig:5 ] .",
    "this makes it difficult to compare the filamentarity in different samples using the values of the average filamentarity ( @xmath88 ) as a function of @xmath64 ( figure [ fig:6 ] ) .",
    "we overcome this by interpolating the values of @xmath88 as a function of @xmath64 at uniformly chosen values which are same for all the samples . the average thickness and length are also interpolated and analyzed in a similar fashion .",
    "further , since the later stages of coarse graining tend to wash out the features of the galaxy distribution , we have restricted our analysis to the range of filling factor @xmath91 .",
    "we first study how the average filamentarity varies across the different luminosity bins discussed in section 2 .",
    "for each luminosity bin we have seven realisations of the galaxy distributions from the seven non - overlapping strips .",
    "the results from all the individual strips in luminosity bin 1 are shown together in figure [ fig:6 ] .",
    "for each bin we use the results from these seven samples to determine the mean and variance of @xmath88 at uniformly chosen values of @xmath64 .",
    "the results are shown in the left panel of figure [ fig:7 ] .",
    "we find that for a fixed value of @xmath64 , the value of @xmath88 decreases with increasing luminosity .",
    "we note that there is some deviation from this behaviour at @xmath92 between bins 3 and 4 , but the overall trend is still valid when we compare these bins with fainter or brighter samples .",
    "further , the luminosity dependence is enhanced with increasing luminosity .    at each values of @xmath64",
    "we use the student s t - test to quantify the statistical significance of the difference in the mean @xmath88 between different luminosity bins .",
    "the variance of @xmath88 is very similar in the different luminosity bins and we estimate the standard error for the difference in the means using    @xmath93    where the sum is over the points in the two samples a and b which are being compared . here",
    "@xmath94 and @xmath95 referes to the mean , and @xmath96 and @xmath97 refers to the number of data points . in our case @xmath98 .",
    "we use @xmath99 to estimate the significance of the differences in the means .",
    "this is expected to follow a student s t - distribution with @xmath100 degrees of freedom .",
    "we accept the difference in the means as being statistically significant if the probability of its occurring by chance is less than @xmath101 .",
    "we find that there are no statistically significant differences between adjacent luminosity bins except the two brightest ones ( bins 4 and 5 ) .",
    "all the non - adjacent bins ( eg . bin 1 and bin 3 , etc . ) show statistically significant differences at most values of @xmath64 . as noted earlier , the @xmath88 curves are sensitive to the galaxy number density . while bins 2 and 3 have been culled so that they have the same number density as bin 1 , bins 4 and 5 have number densities which are @xmath35 and @xmath102 lower respectively .",
    "figure [ fig:11 ] shows the effect of varying the number density by @xmath46 in 18 independent realizations of mock galaxy samples identical to bin 1 in thickness , area and number density ( table  2 ) drawn from dark matter @xmath2cdm n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "the test shows that @xmath46 variations in the number density do not introduce a statistically significant effect on the filamentarity except at @xmath103 .",
    "this is quite distinct from the luminosity dependence seen in the left panel of figure [ fig:7 ] where there are statistically significant differences among the different luminosity bins at all @xmath64 except for @xmath103 .",
    "this clearly establishes the luminosity dependence to be genuine and not an artifact due to number density variations .",
    "we have separately analyzed the filamentarity of the red and blue galaxies in each luminosity bin .",
    "the results for bin 4 are shown in the middle panel of figure [ fig:7 ] .",
    "we find that there is a statistically significant colour dependence . at the smallest value of @xmath64",
    "the red galaxies exhibit a higher filamentarity than the blue ones .",
    "there is a cross - over at @xmath104 , and the blue galaxies have a higher filamentarity than the red ones at larger values of @xmath64 .",
    "a similar trend is found in all the other luminosity bins , results for which are not shown here .",
    "the morphology dependence has been studied separately for each luminosity bin .",
    "the results for bin 4 are shown in the right panel of figure [ fig:7 ] .",
    "the ellipticals have a higher @xmath88 as compared to spirals for @xmath105 whereas the spirals have a higher @xmath88 at larger values of @xmath64 .",
    "we find that the differences are statistically significant for @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the results are similar for the other luminosity bins not shown here .",
    "figure [ fig:9 ] shows the average cluster length , length per void and thickness as a function of @xmath64 for two different luminosity bins , and also the colour and morphology dependence for a fixed luminosity bin ( bin 4 ) .",
    "we see that the clusters are longer for the faint galaxies , blues galaxies and the spirals as compared to the bright galaxies , red galaxies and ellipticals respectively .",
    "unlike the length which increases nearly monotonically with coarse - graining , the cluster length per void is found to be quite stable to coarse - graining after the onset of percolation .",
    "the luminosity , colour and morphology dependence found in the cluster length is exactly reversed when the length per void is considered .",
    "we also note that the luminosity , colour and morphology dependence of the length and the length per void are not at a high level of statistical significance , except at a few points where the data are seen to lie outside the @xmath108 errorbars .",
    "the average cluster thickness , on the other hand , shows statistically significant differences at all values of the filling factor . at the same value of @xmath64 , the clusters are thicker for the bright galaxies , red galaxies and elliptical galaxies as compared to their faint , blue and spiral counterparts respectively",
    "semi analytic models have , over the last two decades emerged as a very powerful tool for studying galaxy formation ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these models describe the evolution of galaxies in a hierarchical clustering scenario incorporating all relevant physics of galaxy formation processes ( eg . gas cooling , star formation , supernovea feedback , metal enrichment , merging etc ) often in an approximate and adhoc fashion .",
    "the detailed physics of star formation and it s regulation by different feedback mechanisms is still poorly understood .",
    "these models serve as simplified simulations of the galaxy formation processes .",
    "the output of the semi analytic models are statistical predictions of galaxy properties at some epoch and the precision of these predictions are directly related to the accuracy of the input physics . in this section",
    "we investigate the luminosity , and colour dependence of galaxy filaments in a particular semi - analytic model and compare the findings with those from the sdss .",
    "we have used the semi analytic galaxy catalogs from the millennium run simulation ( @xcite ) , one of the largest simulation of the growth and evolution of cosmic structures in the universe . the details of the simulation can be found in @xcite . the physical treatment of the galaxy formation processes in this model are described in @xcite .",
    "the spectra and magnitude of the model galaxies were computed using population synthesis models of @xcite and we use the catalog where the galaxy magnitudes are available in sdss u , g , r , i , z filters .",
    "the catalog contains about 9 million galaxies in the full simulation box .",
    "we use these to construct mock strips from the simulation which are otherwise identical to the sdss strips which were analyzed .",
    "the luminosity dependence in the semi - analytic model is shown in the left panel of figure [ fig:8 ] .",
    "this is found to exhibit a strong luminosity dependence .",
    "although the behaviour is qualitatively similar to the actual data , the luminosity dependence is noticeably less pronounced for the brighter galaxies in the semi - analytic model .",
    "the differences between the behaviour in the actual data and the semi - analytic model are clearly seen in the middle panel of figure [ fig:8 ] which , for two luminosity bins , shows the results for the actual data and the semi - analytic model together .",
    "note that while there is a reasonable agreement for the faint luminosity bins , there are sharp differences between the data and the simulations in the filamentarity of the high luminosity galaxies .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig:8 ] shows the colour dependence of the filamentarity in the semi - analytic model . here again , although the model is qualitatively similar to the data , the colour dependence predicted in the model is substantially in excess of those seen in the actual data .",
    "the differences between the data and the simulation is particularly noticeable at low @xmath64 where the filamentarity of the blue galaxies in the model is found to be substantially below that of the actual data .",
    "the simulation results for the red galaxies are in rough agreement with the sdss data .",
    "the concentration index ( @xmath109 ) was not directly available in the particular simulated catalogue which we have used and hence we did not study the morphology dependence for the semi - analytic model .",
    "filaments are the largest known statistically significant coherent features visible in the galaxy distribution .",
    "we test if the degree of filamentarity depends on the galaxy properties .",
    "we find evidence for statistically significant luminosity , colour and morphology dependence in the average filamentarity @xmath88 studied as a function of the filling factor @xmath64 .    comparing the average filamentarity @xmath88 of different luminosity bins ( figure [ fig:7 ] ) , we find that the fainter galaxies have a more filamentary distribution as compared to the brighter ones .",
    "these differences exist at nearly all values of @xmath64 .",
    "the drop in filamentarity with increasing luminosity is found to be particularly more pronounced in the two brightest luminosity bins which we have considered , both of which are brighter than @xmath32 . comparing the thickness and length ( figure [ fig:9 ] ) , we find that at a fixed value of @xmath64 structures traced by the bright galaxies are thicker and shorter than those traced by the faint ones . while the differences in the length are statistically significant only at large @xmath64 , the differences in the thickness are statistically significant at all values of the filling factor . with increasing coarse - graining",
    "there is a percolation transition at @xmath110 beyond which there is an interconnected network of filaments encircling voids .",
    "after the onset of percolation the length per void gives an estimate of the circumference of the filaments encircling the voids and dividing this by @xmath111 gives an estimate of the average void diameter .",
    "we find that the faint galaxy distribution is more porous ( larger number of holes or voids ) and has smaller voids with a typical void diameter @xmath112 as compared to the bright galaxy distribution which has a typical void diameter @xmath113 .",
    "note that these estimates of the void diameter could be somewhat flawed because the estimated void diameters exceed the radial extent ( @xmath114 ) of the samples which we have used to test luminosity dependence ( figure [ fig:2 ] ) , but they serve the purpose of demonstrating the luminosity dependence of the void size .",
    "our findings indicate that galaxies of different luminosity are not uniformly distributed along the cosmic web .",
    "the brighter galaxies are preferentially distributed in more compact and thicker regions with large voids in between whereas the fainter galaxies inhabit thin , elongated regions with more numerous voids of smaller diameter .",
    "we note that studies using the projected two - point correlation function ( eg . @xcite ; @xcite ) show an increase in correlation amplitude with increasing luminosity , the effect being pronounced beyond @xmath115 .",
    "these earlier results are consistent with our findings but they do not have any information about the shapes of the clustering patterns .",
    "recent studies ( eg . @xcite ; @xcite ) also show evidence for luminosity dependence at higher redshifts ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "the results for the colour and morphology dependence of the average filamentarity are somewhat different from those for the luminosity dependence .",
    "we find that the red galaxies and the ellipticals have a higher filamentarity as compared to the blue galaxies and spirals respectively at low filling factors ( figure [ fig:9 ] ) .",
    "there is a cross - over at @xmath117 for the colour dependence and @xmath118 for the morphology dependence .",
    "the blue galaxies and the spirals have a higher filamentarity as compared to the red galaxies and the ellipticals respectively at large filling factors .",
    "considering the length and the thickness ( figure [ fig:9 ] ) , we find that the length shows a statistically significant colour and morphology dependence only at large @xmath64 ( beyond percolation ) where the distribution of blue galaxies and the spirals has a greater length as compared to red galaxies and ellipticals respectively .",
    "the red galaxies and ellipticals have a thicker distribution , the differences being statistically significant at all @xmath64 . considering the voids , we find that the distribution of red galaxies has fewer voids which are larger ( diameter @xmath119 ) whereas the distribution of blue galaxies has more voids which are smaller ( diameter @xmath120 ) .",
    "the ellipticals and spirals show similar differences with void diameters @xmath121 and @xmath122 respectively .",
    "these estimates of the void diameter are quite reliable as the sample size ( bin 4 ) is larger than the void diameter ( figure [ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "we note that our estimates are somewhat larger compared to results using other methods .",
    "for example , @xcite have found that the voids have a scale of around @xmath123 in iras 1.2 jy redshift survey .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached by @xcite from their analysis of the northern local void .",
    "a recent analysis of voids in the 2dfgrs by @xcite find that voids have typical diameters of @xmath124 .",
    "most of these estimates use the area or volume to determine the void diameter whereas we use the void perimeter .",
    "substructures in the void perimeter is possibly the dominant reason why we get a larger estimate of the diameter .",
    "further , the large variance in the void diameter seems to indicate that they have a large spread in sizes .",
    "the colour and morphology are very strongly correlated galaxy properties , the red galaxies being predominantly ellipticals and the blue ones spirals .",
    "it is well known that elliptical are found primarily in dense groups and clusters @xcite whereas the spirals are distributed in the field .",
    "our finding that at large length - scales the structures traced by the ellipticals are thicker , and less filamentary as compared to the spirals is consistent with a picture where the entire galaxy population is distributed along an interconnected network of filaments encircling voids , the cosmic web .",
    "the ellipticals preferentially inhabit the dense groups and clusters which can be identified with the nodes of the cosmic web , the places where filaments intersect .",
    "the spirals , on the other hand , are sparsely distributed along the filaments .",
    "the colour and morphology are also known to be correlated with the luminosity .",
    "the more luminous galaxies are predominantly ellitpicals and the fainter ones spirals .",
    "the fact that at small filling factors ( which we may associate with small length - scales ) the eliipticals have a more filamentary distribution as compared to spirals , whereas the opposite is found at large length - scales is quite intriguing .",
    "we discuss below a possible interpretation of this finding .",
    "the higher filamentarity of the ellipticals at low @xmath64 seem to indicate that in addition to residing in the clusters at the intersection of filaments , the ellipticals also extend a little along the filaments which originate from the clusters .",
    "the spirals on the other hand , are distributed along the entire extent of the filaments .",
    "this is shown schematically in figure [ fig:10 ] . in this picture",
    "the ellipticals have a more compact distribution , and as a consequence they connect up to form filamentary clusters at the initial stages of coarse graining . since these structures are localized near the nodes of the filaments and they do not extend along the entire length of the filaments , their filamentarity increases slowly during the later stages of coarse graining .",
    "the spirals , on the other hand , are sparsely distributed along the entire length of the filaments .",
    "they connect up only at a later stage of coarse graining to define the entire filamentary network of the cosmic web .",
    "this is a possible explanation why at low filling factors the ellipticals have a higher filamentarity than the spirals .",
    "further , it also indicates that with increasing filling factor ( later stages of coarse graining ) the filamentarity of the spirals should grow faster than that of the ellipticals as seen in ( figure [ fig:7 ] ) .",
    "finally we note that the qualitative picture presented here is a plausible model which is consistent with the quantitative findings of this paper .",
    "we do not claim that it is the only possible explanation , and it is presented here more in the spirit of a hypothesis rather than a conclusion .",
    "further work is required to establish or refute this picture .    as already mentioned several times ,",
    "it should be noted , that the curves showing @xmath125 as a function of @xmath64 are not absolute .",
    "they depend on the geometry of the volume ( both shape and size ) and the galaxy number density .",
    "it is only meaningful to compare different galaxy samples for which these quantities are the same .",
    "once these are fixed , we can attribute changes in the filamentarity to factors like luminosity , colour or morphology which we are testing for .",
    "observational findings indicate a close connection between the local density and galaxy type @xcite with an increase in the elliptical and s0 population and a decrease in the spirals in galaxy clusters .",
    "our findings are consistent with this , and it indicates that there is an excess of ellipticals on scales larger than the clusters extending to some extent into the filaments . in the zeldovich pancake scenario filaments form at the intersection of sheets and clusters form at the nodes of the filaments .",
    "structure formation occurs in a hierarchical fashion with sheets forming first , matter flows along the sheets into the filaments which in turn drain into the clusters .",
    "the higher galaxy density and a denser hot gas environment are possibly the factors leading to a higher elliptical fraction in the vicinity of the nodes .",
    "the relation between our findings and the various theories for galaxy formation is an important issue .",
    "we have compared our findings against the millennium run @xcite which is one of the largest simulated galaxy catalogues that incorporates the theory of galaxy formation in a semi - analytic fashion .",
    "the semi - analytic model has a number of parameters which have been tuned to match various observed properties of the local galaxy distribution like the luminosity functions and the tully - fisher relation . in this paper",
    "we have compared the filamentarity of the galaxy distribution in the semi - analytic model against the actual data from the sdss dr4 .",
    "studying this in different luminosity bins we find that the two are consistent for @xmath126 galaxies , while the brighter galaxies show significant differences .",
    "for the brighter galaxies , at large filling factors the semi - analytic model predicts a substantially higher filamentarity as compared to the actual data , whereas it underpredicts the same at small @xmath64 .",
    "though the semi - analytic model correctly predicts the number density of very luminous galaxies as reflected in the luminosity function , it fails to correctly reproduce the geometry of their spatial distribution . for these galaxies the model does not predict a sufficiently filamentary distribution at small length - scales whereas there is an excess filamentarity predicted at large scales .    comparing the filamentarity predicted by the model against the actual data for galaxies of different colours , we find that the two are consistent for red galaxies whereas the distribution of the blue galaxies are quite different .",
    "for these galaxies the model markedly underpredicts the filamentarity at small length - scales or filling factors .",
    "we speculate that the discrepancy may be a consequence of two possible ingredients of the model , the first being a radio mode feedback from agns in massive halos introduced to stop cooling flows .",
    "this effectively quenches star formation in the galaxies in these halos thereby transforming them into red galaxies .",
    "the second possibility is the prescription ( plane parallel slab model ) of @xcite to include the effects of dust when calculating the galaxy luminosities and colours .",
    "it may be noted that @xcite have found discrepancies in the colour dependence of the two point correlation function .",
    "they find that the differences in the correlation amplitudes of the red and blue galaxies predicted by the model are in excess of that seen in the 2dfgrs and sdss .",
    "in conclusion we note that the filamentary pattern seen in the galaxy distribution exhibits statistically significant luminosity , colour and morphology dependence .",
    "we have speculated on a geometrical picture which can explain some features of the colour and morphology dependence of the filamentarity .",
    "explaining the origin of the observed luminosity , colour and morphology dependence in terms of the theories of galaxy formation is an important issue which needs to be addressed in the future .",
