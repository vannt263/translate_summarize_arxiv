    "bipolar molecular outflows are ubiquitously present around young stellar objects ( ysos ) and are associated with the very early stages of star formation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a large range of excitation conditions and a significant chemical differentiation are present along the lobes of the outflows .",
    "the shock  excited gas cools mainly radiatively via the emission of atomic and molecular species whose abundances are strongly enhanced by the shocks generated by the interaction between the protostellar wind and the molecular cloud .",
    "high velocity ( v@xmath4100 km s@xmath5 ) clumps , the so called molecular bullets , are detected along the axis of some outflows .",
    "the prototype of such bullets are those observed in sio in the lobes of the l1148 outflow @xcite but they generally show weak emission of other molecular lines .",
    "a few outflows however , e.g. l1157 and cb3 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , have a particular rich emission spectrum with molecular clumps at relatively low velocity ( v@xmath6 10 km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "these molecular clumps show emission from molecular species usually unobserved along outflows and they have dimensions which do not exceed 0.1 pc .",
    "while the high velocities and high abundance of sio suggest that the molecular bullets are most likely associated with mini - bow shocks formed by the outflow propagation ( e.g. @xcite ) , the origin of the low velocity clumps is not yet clear . in a recent study @xcite ( thereafter paper i ) , have investigated two possibilities for the origin of the low velocity clumps : i ) the clumps are formed by episodic mass loss of the forming object or ii ) the clumps are density structure pre - existing the advent of the outflow and the effect of the outflow is to accelerate and shock them , altering their chemistry .",
    "paper i used a chemical model to simulate the clump formation and its subsequent interaction with the outflow and inferred that the low velocity outflow clumps are probably density structures formed , at least partly , prior of the advent of the outflow . with the advent of the outflow , not only the temperature of the clumps increases ( @xmath7 100 k ) , but the clumps also undergo a short period of non - dissociative shock .",
    "this preliminary conclusion was reached by comparing the column densities derived by the chemical models with existing single dish observations along the cb3 @xcite and l1157 outflows @xcite .",
    "the shortcomings of such an analysis were that the estimations of the column densities derived from the chemical models , as well as those derived from the observations , suffer from high uncertainties due to the fact that some of the parameters required to calculate them may be unknown .",
    "in particular , to estimate the observed column densities arbitrary assumptions have to be made regarding lte conditions , excitation temperatures and the lines being optically thin . on the other hand , the theoretical calculation of column densities from the chemical model required knowledge of the geometry of the emitting region .",
    "however , when dealing with small emitting regions , such as the low velocity clumps along molecular outflows , the observations ( usually single dish with spatial resolution of few tens of arcsec ) do not constrain such geometry . if more transitions of the same species are available , one can use a large velocity gradient ( lvg ) model to derive the density and temperature of the emitting gas but even in such cases often the results have a large uncertainty because the observed line ratios are not always sensitive to the temperature or density .    one way to reduce the number of arbitrary assumptions is to model _ directly _ the observed line emission using a radiative transfer model that predicts the line profile , a method already adopted by other authors ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . in this work",
    "we attempt such an approach by coupling the time dependent chemical model of paper i with the radiative transfer model spherical multi - mol ( smmol ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , we expand the grids of chemical models computed in paper i and use them as input parameters for the radiative transfer model to simulate the line profiles of several species and , where possible , of multiple transitions of the same species .",
    "we then simultaneously fit such profiles with the observations of cb3 and attempt to constrain the physical parameters of the emitting gas and thus their formation scenario .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in section 2 both the chemical and the radiative transfer models are briefly described . in section 3",
    "the models are compared with the lines detected towards a clump in the cb3 outflow .",
    "the results are presented in section 4 and discussed in section 5 .",
    "a flow diagram of the method used to compare the observed data with the theoretical models is shown in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] . a first order estimate of the general physical conditions of the clump , such as the size",
    ", the density and the temperature , is derived from the observations and used to describe the physics of the phenomenon in the chemical model .",
    "the chemical model predicts the fractional abundances ; these are given as input to the radiative transfer model together with the density , the temperature and the beam of the telescope to produce the line profiles that are @xmath8 compared with the observed profiles .",
    "recently , the same method has been used for modelling the envelope of low mass protostars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and it was found to be a powerful tool to probe the physical and chemical structure of the protostellar envelopes as well as the age of the protostar .",
    "the time - dependent chemical model is described in detail in paper i. here we summarize the important characteristics : the chemical network is taken from the umist database and includes 221 species involved in 3194 gas - phase and grain reactions .",
    "the model is a two - phase calculation .",
    "phase i simulates the formation of a pre - existing clump , or of the homogeneous dark cloud , depending on what scenario we are modelling , and includes freeze - out of the gas on to the grains ( see paper i and below ) .",
    "phase ii simulates the advent of the outflow by warming the clump to 100 - 200 k or , in the presence of a non - dissociative shock , by increasing the gas temperature to 1000 k for 100 yr and then cooling it down to 100 - 200 k. as a reminder , the four scenarios considered here ( as in paper i ) are :    * grid a : a pre - existent clump at uniform density warmed by the outflow . in this paper",
    "we introduce new models , called as , where the clump at uniform single density is shocked by the outflow ; * grid b : a pre - existing clump with a density structure shocked by the outflow ; * grid c : a pre - existing clump with a density structure warmed by the outflow ; * grid d : a clump formed and warmed or shocked by the outflow .    for each grid different conditions are investigated , changing the model parameters : the depletion efficiency , the type of collapse ( free fall or retarded ) , the grain mantle evaporation ( instantaneous or time - dependent ) , the final density and temperature , the initial sulphur abundance ( see section 4.1 ) , the fraction of frozen h@xmath3co and co converted into ch@xmath2oh ( see section 4.4 ) , for a total of 33 models .",
    "each model is time - dependent and evolves for 10@xmath9 yr .",
    "see paper i for a full description of the model and its assumptions , as well as of each scenario .",
    "the chemical abundances produced by the chemical model together with the density and temperature profile are used as input for the radiative transfer model smmol @xcite , an approximate @xmath10-iteration ( ali ) code that solves multi - level non - lte radiative transfer problems .",
    "the molecular data needed for the calculation are taken from the lambdamoldata ] public database @xcite , except the ch@xmath2oh - a data which we obtained from d. flower ( private communication ) . as first step",
    "the code calculates the total radiation field and the level populations assuming lte and the interstellar radiation field as input continuum @xcite .",
    "it then re - calculates the total radiation field , checks for convergence and repeats the process until convergence is achieved . at each radial point",
    "the code generates the level populations and the radiation field .",
    "the emergent intensity distributions are then convolved with the telescope beam , so that the model directly predicts the line profiles for a given source as observed with a given telescope ( e.g. the iram 30-m telescope in this work ) .",
    "the radiative transfer model has been successfully benchmarked with other radiative transfer codes @xcite . for each model",
    "the radiative transfer program has been run for a selected subset of the time steps of the chemical model for a total of 19 time steps starting from 10@xmath11 yr after the formation of the clump to 10@xmath9 yr .",
    ".list of the molecules and transitions observed in the s1 clump of the cb3 outflow that are modeled with the radiative transfer code . [ cols=\"<,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      yr ( continuum line).,width=226 ]        ( 3@xmath12 - 2@xmath13 ) and ch@xmath2oh ( 5@xmath1 - 4@xmath1 ) lines observed in the clump s1 of the cb3 outflow ( histogram ) with the line profile predicted by the best fit model as1 at t=4@xmath14 yr ( continuum line )",
    ". the size of the clump is d=0.05pc.,width=226 ]    next we attempt to fit simultaneously the cs and so transitions together with the 5 lower energy transitions of ch@xmath2oh ( 3@xmath0 - 2@xmath1 and 2@xmath1 - 1@xmath1 ) .",
    "we find no models able to fit simultaneously the 3 species within 50% .",
    "in fact , from the fitting of the single species ( see section 4.5 ) we see that the low energy methanol lines seem to trace a slightly higher density ( model b10 with n(h@xmath3)=(5 - 10)@xmath15 @xmath16 ) than the cs and so component ( model b9 with n(h@xmath3)=(3 - 6)@xmath15 @xmath16 ) , but the same temperature ( t@xmath7200k ) and very similar time ( 6@xmath14 yr and 3@xmath14 yr respectively ) .",
    "however the difference in the density is not so relevant , considering also the high uncertainties in the model especially for methanol because of line overlap effects , and we think that probably the low energy transitions of ch@xmath2oh could be associated with the same extended gas component traced by cs and so .",
    "finally we check whether the h@xmath3co 3@xmath17 - 2@xmath18 line could be associated with one of the two identified components .",
    "we find that the b9 model with clump size of 0.12 pc at t=3@xmath14 yr predicts a line about 25 times brighter than the observed one . indeed , as said in section 4.4 , assuming a size of 0.12 pc the h@xmath3co can be fitted only at very early epoch ( t@xmath64@xmath19 yr ) while for more evolved times all the models predict far too much h@xmath3co . on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider the smaller component , i.e. the as1 model at 4@xmath14 yr with clump size of 0.05 pc , the theoretical intensity is only 3 times higher than the observed one , while at the early epoch of 2 @xmath14 a very good fit ( within 20% ) of the observed line is obtained .",
    "although a global fit of the h@xmath3co with the so@xmath3 and high @xmath20 ch@xmath2oh lines can not be obtained within the 50% of tolerance , we think that h@xmath3co does not trace the whole clump but is associated with the smaller gas component and it is probably emitted by a region even smaller than 0.05 pc .",
    "the s1 clump has also been observed in the co ( 2 - 1 ) line ; however the profile of this transition is very different with respect to all the other lines : a blue non - gaussian line wing and a self absorption at the ambient lsr velocity ( -38.5 km@xmath5 ) are present in the line .",
    "this profile indicates that the line has a substantial contribution from the large scale outflowing gas and also that part of the emission is self absorbed by the ambient cloud .",
    "moreover , @xcite estimate a temperature of @xmath710 k for the co at all the line velocities and they find that the ( 2 - 1 ) line is optically thick showing that the emission is dominated by the outer , colder part of the outflow rather than by the s1 clump .",
    "all these considerations lead us to not consider the co ( 2 - 1 ) line for the global fit of the s1 clump .",
    "however , we still ran the radiative transfer code for co in order to roughly evaluate if in the best fit models the contribution of the clump to this line is negligible as we expected .",
    "indeed , we find that in the b9 model , that fits cs and so , the predicted co(2 - 1 ) flux is only 23% of the observed flux .",
    "we find that some species are very sensitive to time , such as s - bearing molecules , in agreement with several previous studies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and they can therefore be used to determine the age of the s1 clump .",
    "we fit both the components of the clump with the same time @xmath7 34@xmath14 yr which is similar to the dynamical time of the s1 clump estimated from the sio emission ( t@xmath21 yr , @xcite ) .",
    "note however that our starting point ( t=0 ) in all scenarios is set to be when the outflow starts interacting with the surrounding environment hence the age we derive is not necessarily the age of the outflow .",
    "a time - dependent chemical model has been coupled with a radiative transfer code to model the observed molecular lines emission in the small chemically rich clump s1 along the south lobe of the cb3 outflow .",
    "this proved to be a powerful tool in constraining the physical and chemical parameters of the gas , especially when there is more than one transition of the same molecule .",
    "we find that more than one model is able to fit the line emission of single species . hence to constrain the physical parameters of our clump",
    "a multi - line analysis is needed .",
    "different scenarios for the formation of the clump have been investigated within a large range of physical conditions .",
    "our results show that most of the observed lines can not be fitted by models from the scenarios a , c and d. on the contrary , the models from scenario b or as seem to reproduce most of our data .",
    "this is consistent with our previous findings ( see paper i ) .",
    "we conclude that the observed dense clumps are , at least partially , formed prior to the advent of the outflow .",
    "the advent of the outflow on such clumps leads to a short phase of high temperature ( t@xmath71000k ) followed by fast cooling down to temperatures of @xmath7 200 k.    in addition to the large scale outflowing gas traced by the non - gaussian wings detected in the co ( 2 - 1 ) line , we identify two other components inside the large iram-30 m beam .",
    "the extended component ( d=0.12 pc ) is traced by cs and so and probably by the lower energy transitions ( 3@xmath1 - 2@xmath1 and 2@xmath0 - 1@xmath1 ) of ch@xmath2oh .",
    "this component is not uniform in density but it has a density structure in the range 3@xmath15- 10@xmath22 @xmath16 .",
    "the second component is more compact , with size @xmath70.05 pc and density @xmath7 5@xmath23 @xmath16 , and it is traced by so@xmath3 , h@xmath3co and the 5@xmath1 - 4@xmath1 ch@xmath2oh lines .",
    "for both the components we estimated a similar temperature ( t@xmath7200 k ) and time ( t@xmath73@xmath14 yr ) from when the clump has started to interact with the outflow . since the compact component is traced by the higher energy transitions of ch@xmath2oh , it is probably at higher excitation and may trace the zone of stronger interaction between the outflow and the clump .",
    "however , the analysis of the ch@xmath2oh data needs to be confirmed by modelling of the data with a radiative transfer code that takes into account the effects of line - overlap ( gray & yates , in prep ) .",
