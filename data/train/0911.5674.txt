    "it is also clear that the radio emission from ne shows no variation and the primary radio component is the source of the variations in .    at both 4.8  ghz and 8.4  ghz",

    "for these observations , the primary source flux was determined , for the first time , by subtracting the derived mean flux observed for ne from the total observed flux at each frequency .    using fluxes from the primary at all observing epochs , the period of variation was determined using a string - length technique @xcite .",

    "[ fig : sec_spectrum ] suggests that a 15-ghz flux around 1  mjy would present a unique spectrum not observed previously in a wcr .",
    "hence , it is estimated that the 15-ghz flux of ne , and hence the primary component , has a systematic error of less than @xmath112  mjy , which still gives low - state continuum spectra consistent with thermal wind emission .",

    "<S> an examination of radial velocity observations available from the literature suggests reflex motion of the binary due to star c , for which a mass of @xmath6  m@xmath7 is deduced . </S>",
    "<S> the natures of ne and star d are also examined . if ne is a wcr , </S>",
    "<S> as suggested by other authors , then the required mass - loss rate is an order of magnitude higher than expected for an early b - type dwarf , and only just consistent with a supergiant . </S>",
    "<S> this raises the question of ne as a wcr , but its non - thermal luminosity is consistent with a wcr and a comparison of reddening between and star d do not rule out an association , implying is a quadruple system . pursuing alternative models for ne , such as an unassociated background source , would require very challenging observations . </S>"
