    "in recent years , generalized - ensemble algorithms are frequently employed to study biomolecular systems ( for reviews , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "this is because it is difficult to obtain sufficient sampling in the conformational space of these systems by conventional canonical - ensemble simulations @xcite .",
    "the canonical simulations tend to get trapped in a local - minimum free - energy state of the biomolecular systems .",
    "the replica - exchange method ( rem ) @xcite is one of the most well - known methods among the generalized - ensemble algorithms .",
    "non - interacting copies ( replicas ) of a target system are employed in rem .",

    "are realized .",
    "accordingly , the simulation can escape from local - minimum states .",
    "it is easier to perform replica - exchange molecular dynamics ( md ) or monte carlo ( mc ) simulations than to perform multicanonical md @xcite or mc simulations @xcite , although the multicanonical algorithm is also one of the most well - known generalized - ensemble algorithms . in the multicanonical and similar algorithms @xcite",
    "non - boltzmann weight factors are used as the weight factors .",
    "these non - boltzmann weight factors are not _ a priori _ known and have to be determined by iterative procedures . in rem , however , the usual boltzmann weight factor is employed for each replica .",
    "therefore , there is no necessity to perform the procedures of obtaining the weight factor .    in rem the metropolis algorithm @xcite",
    "is utilized to exchange the temperatures between the replicas .",
    "the metropolis algorithm is a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method and widely employed to obtain a required ensemble .",
    "the metropolis algorithm is designed so as to satisfy the detailed balance condition , which is a sufficient condition to perform state transitions based on mcmc .",
    "trials of such state transitions are accepted or rejected stochastically , and their rejection ratio increases when there is a large difference between the probability distributions . in order to minimize the rejection ratio ,",
    "new algorithm was proposed recently by suwa and todo @xcite .    in the suwa - todo algorithm",
    "the detailed balance condition is not imposed .",
    "they introduced a graphical procedure called _ weight allocation _ instead of solving the detailed balance condition algebraically . by minimizing the rejection ratio with the weight allocation",
    ", this algorithm realizes efficient sampling of states . for a system which has only two states for each particle like the ising model",
    ", however , this algorithm is exactly the same as the metropolis algorithm @xcite .    to take advantage of the suwa - todo algorithm",
    ", one might consider to exchange temperatures in rem by this algorithm .",
    "for example , let us consider the following exchange of the temperatures @xmath1 and @xmath2 between the replicas , replica 1 and replica 2 : @xmath3 . in this case , the number of all combinations of the replicas and temperatures is only two , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . for this exchange , therefore , the suwa - todo algorithm is exactly the same as the metropolis algorithm . in general , because temperatures are exchanged between two replicas as in this example , rem is not able to take advantage of the suwa - todo algorithm .    in order to solve this difficulty",

    "are permuted among more than two replicas by the suwa - todo algorithm .",
    "we can utilize the suwa - todo algorithm because the number of all combinations of the replicas and temperatures is larger than two .",
    "we first apply this new method to particles in a double - well potential energy . for a comparison purposes , rpm with the metropolis algorithm , and rem",
    "are also performed .",
    "as the second application of rpm , we employ met - enkephalin in vacuum . this penta - peptide is often used as a test system to see the usefulness of new algorithms @xcite .",
    "furthermore , rpm is applied to a c - peptide analog of ribonuclease a in explicit water , which is known to form a @xmath0-helix structure @xcite , to see its sampling efficiency for a larger biomolecular system .",
    "the results of the second and third applications are compared with those of rem .",
