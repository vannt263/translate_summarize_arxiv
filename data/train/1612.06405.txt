    "when direct temperature measurements are missing , statistical methods are used to infer abundances in giant hiiregions .",
    "there are two families of statistical methods .",
    "one is based on calibrating samples of objects for which the abundance could be derived from temperature - based methods .",
    "the other is based on photoionization model grids .",
    "the latter is free from observational biases , but the grid must cover all the configurations that could be found in nature .",
    "bond(bayesian oxygen and nitrogen abundance determinations ) belongs to the second family .",
    "bondinfers oxygen and nitrogen abundances using carefully selected strong and semistrong lines by comparing them to a grid of photoionization models . the source code is open and freely available at http://bond.ufsc.br/. full details can be found at vale asari etal.(2016 ) .",
    "this manuscript is intended to be a quick - start guide to highlight the most important aspects of the method .",
    "common strong line methods based on simple calibrations ( / , /h@xmath1 , @xmath2 \\else [ o~{\\scshape ii}]\\fi\\xspace}+{\\ifmmode [ \\mathrm{o}\\,\\textsc{iii } ] \\else [ o~{\\scshape iii}]\\fi\\xspace})/{\\ifmmode \\mathrm{h}\\beta \\else h$\\beta$\\fi\\xspace}$ ] ) assume that emission - line nebulae are a one - parameter family , and that such parameter is the oxygen abundance . the first to realise the importance of introducing a secondary parameter to measure abundances was mcgaugh ( 1991 ) , who considered the effect of the ionization parameter @xmath3 . nowadays there is a plethora of methods to measure abundances based on the comparison of observed to theoretical emission lines from a grid of photoionization models ( mcgaugh 1991 ; kewley & dopita 2002 ; tremonti etal.2004 ; dopita etal.2013 ; prez - montero 2014 ; blanc etal.2015 ) .",
    "we will discuss the difference of our method with respect to others .",
    "one novelty in our grid of photoionization models is that we do not impose any a priori relation between n / o and o / h .",
    "the only other method that also does not tie in the nitrogen and oxygen abundances is the one by prez - montero ( 2014 ) , with the difference that his method uses auroral lines ( so it is not a strong line method ) , and it selects models around the empirical n / o versus o / h relation if auroral lines are not available .",
    "another novelty in our method is that it uses bayesian inference to measure abundances , not quite unlike the one by blanc etal.(2015 ) .",
    "the curious reader is referred to section [ sec : bayes ] for the key points ; we warn that , although bayesian inference is part and parcel of our method , it is not the most important aspect of bond .",
    "the killer features in bondare : ( a ) n / o is free to vary , ( b ) it distinguishes between the lower and upper metallicity branches , and ( c ) it considers the effect of varying the hardness of the ionizing radiation field .",
    "the next section shows how we have tackled ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , and explains the reasoning behind choosing which emission lines need to be fitted .",
    "our grid of photoionization models spans a wide range in o / h , n / o , and @xmath3 . the ionizing radiation field is provided by the instantaneous starburst models of moll etal.(2009 ) for six different ages .",
    "two nebular geometries are considered ( thin shell and filled sphere ) .",
    "we thus have five parameters in our models .",
    "even though we are interested in measuring only two of them , o / h and n / o , we still ought to have good constraints for the other three ` uninteresting ' parameters : @xmath3 , the hardness of the ionizing radiation field , and the density structure .",
    "that is why we have chosen a set of emission lines carefully tailored to constrain those five parameters all at once .    in the following we list these emission lines and explain the reason behind each of them .",
    "note that the ( reddening - corrected ) intensities of _ all _ of those lines with respect to h@xmath0  are needed to run bond .    * the strong lines h@xmath0 , 3726 + 3729 @xmath4 , 5007 @xmath5 , and 6584 @xmath6 .",
    "they were chosen because , to first order , the strong line ratios @xmath7 \\else [ o~{\\scshape iii}]\\fi\\xspace}+{\\ifmmode [ \\mathrm{o}\\,\\textsc{ii } ] \\else [ o~{\\scshape ii}]\\fi\\xspace})/{\\ifmmode",

    "we fit line intensities with respect to h@xmath0 , and not the latter strong line ratios directly , because we assume that the intensities with respect to h@xmath0follow a gaussian distribution when we calculate likelihood probabilities . * the semistrong lines 7135 @xmath10and 3869 @xmath11(plus upper limits for auroral lines of o@xmath12and n@xmath13 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath7 \\else [ o~{\\scshape iii}]\\fi\\xspace}+{\\ifmmode [ \\mathrm{o}\\,\\textsc{ii } ] \\else [ o~{\\scshape ii}]\\fi\\xspace})/{\\ifmmode \\mathrm{h}\\beta \\else h$\\beta$\\fi\\xspace}$ ] is bi - valued with respect to the oxygen abundance ( see the inverted u shape of the relation in fig .  [",
    "fig : bond - grid ] , left ) .",
    "that is why some methods impose a fixed relation between n / o versus o / h in their photoionization models ( e.g.  dopita etal.2013 ; blanc etal .",
    "since we are interested in inferring both n / o and o / h , we did not want to use nitrogen lines to break the bimodality in the oxygen abundance . restricting our search to emission lines easy to measure in typical optical spectra ( though",
    "not always reported in the literature ) , we found an ideal candidate in the emission line ratio /.",
    "ar@xmath12and ne@xmath12are formed in roughly the same zone , but the excitation potentials of and are very different ( 1.7 and 3.2 ev , respectively ) , so the ratio of these lines is sensitive to the electronic temperature .",
    "argon and neon are primary elements and their global abundance ratio is expected to be constant . besides , they are both inert , thus do not suffer dust depletion , so their abundance ratio in the ionized gas phase remains constant .",
    "[ fig : bond - grid ] ( centre ) shows the line ratio /in our grid as a function of /(the latter traces the ionization parameter @xmath3 ) .",
    "the points are colour - coded as falling in the lower or upper metallicity branch ( blue and red , respectively ) , showing that /can break the bimodality in the oxygen abundance .",
    "an extra help on finding the right metallicity branch can come from _ upper limits _ in auroral lines . * the semistrong line i5876 he  i@xmath14 .",
    "this is the crucial part of bond .",
    "since we consider different ionization scenarios , e.g. different spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of the ionizing radiation , we need to infer which of those scenarios is more appropriate .",
    "we expect the sed to be different in different hii regions due to ageing ( so the most massive stars have disappeared ) or due to stochastic effects in low luminosity hiiregions when the upper part in the stellar initial mass function of the ionizing cluster is not fully sampled .",
    "[ fig : bond - grid ] ( left ) shows how the emissivity of @xmath7 \\else [ o~{\\scshape iii}]\\fi\\xspace}+{\\ifmmode [ \\mathrm{o}\\,\\textsc{ii } ] \\else [ o~{\\scshape ii}]\\fi\\xspace})/{\\ifmmode \\mathrm{h}\\beta \\else h$\\beta$\\fi\\xspace}$ ] depends not only on the oxygen abundance ( abscissa ) , but also on he hardness of the ionizing radiation field ( colour code ) . note that at high metallicities a single value of @xmath7 \\else",

    "[ fig : bond - grid ] ( right ) shows that the i5876 he  i@xmath14/h@xmath0line can be used as a proxy of the hardness of the ionizing radiation field .",
    "first , let us emphasise that the bayesian inference is _ not _ what sets bondapart . the heart and soul of bondis the set of carefully selected emission line ratios , tailor - made both to infer the oxygen and nitrogen abundances in hiiregions , and to take into account important secondary parameters .",
    "as reasoned in the previous section , this allows us to ( a ) break the bimodality in oxygen abundance without any a priori relation between n / o versus o / h , and ( b ) consider the ( previously neglected ) role of the ionizing radiation field in abundance determinations .    that said , we have opted for bayesian inference for good reasons . before diving into the most important bayesian aspects , let us examine the method s acronym .",
    "bondstands for bayesian oxygen and nitrogen abundance determinations .",
    "our method is not called oxygen and nitrogen abundance , ionization parameter , and hardness of the ionizing radiation field determinations ( onihd ) . the reason why the letters ih are not in the method s name is the same reason why we have decided to introduce the b for bayesian in its name : the ionization parameter and hardness of the ionizing radiation field are _ nuisance _ parameters , and the only way to get rid of them respecting dimensional analysis is by going bayesian .",
    "let us lay out the problem to see how its resolution points to bayesian inference .",
    "we start with a carefully designed photoionization grid , finely spaced and spanning a wide range in o / h , n / o , and @xmath3 .",
    "it also considers a few values of hardness of the ionizing radiation field mimicked by different sed ages .",
    "even though the latter two parameters ( @xmath3 and ionizing radiation field ) are important and need to be well modelled , they are of _ secondary _ interest .",
    "this is why our acronym shifts from onihd to ond .",
    "how do we get rid of parameters for which we do not care ( a.k.a._nuisance _ parameters ) ?",
    "if we want to consider the probabilities of all models in our grid at the same time , then we can simply _ marginalise _ over the nuisance parameters .",
    "marginalising is nothing more than integrating over a parameter .",
    "for instance , for a fixed o / h and n / o , we marginalise over @xmath3 simply by adding up all the probabilities of all models of a given o / h and n / o for all @xmath3 .",
    "the trick is that to integrate , say , in @xmath15 , the probability density function ( pdf ) in the integrand must have physical units of @xmath16 .",
    "ordinary likelihood pdfs ( e.g.  @xmath17 for gaussian distributions , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the observed line intensity and its uncertainty , and @xmath20 is the computed line intensity . ] ) have units which are the inverse of the observational data being fitted .",
    "so , from a _ pragmatic _ point of view , we are obliged to write out the posterior pdfs , which have the correct physical units when we integrate over a model parameter . for a thorough argument on the dimensional analysis of pdfs , see hogg ( 2012 ) , especially the discussion around his equation 3 .",
    "in other words , going bayesian gives us licence to kill the nuisance parameters , so we need to add b to ond . to write the posterior pdfs",
    ", we need to spell out our priors .",
    "this has a two - fold benefit .",
    "first , we can plug in an informative prior : if we have empirical evidence that some models are more probable in nature than others , we can give them more weight by setting the prior probabilities just right . in our code",
    "so far , we have taken the most conservative approach we can and , following blanc etal.(2015 ) , we use an uninformative prior ( specifically , a jeffrey s prior that is logarithmic in o / h , n / o and @xmath3 ) .",
    "the second benefit of setting a prior is that we have an explicit prescription for making a finer grid .",
    "the problem of comparing data to a uniformly spaced grid of models by using a @xmath21 likelihood is that most models will be very distant from the observed data as measured by the uncertainties @xmath19 .",
    "if a grid is very very rough , the closest model might even be a few @xmath19 away from the model with the highest likelihood .",
    "an ad hoc prescription to deal with this problem is by setting up cooking factors to increase the observed uncertainties , thus decreasing the distances between observed and computed emission lines .",
    "a cooking factor has no real justification and needs to be tailored to work for each new data point .",
    "since we are using a bayesian prescription , we can do much better than relying on ad hoc prescriptions .",
    "we simply interpolate our grid where we need  and interpolation in @xmath22 n / o , o / h and @xmath3 is reasonable once the grid is fine enough .",
    "the interpolation is informed by posterior probability of each element in the grid : if an element has a high probability , it is worth creating more grid points inside its volume .",
    "just a final note on the bayesian parlance .",
    "the outcome of a bayesian inference is the posterior pdf for a set of model parameters ( say , o / h , n / o , @xmath3 , hardness of the ionizing radiation field ) .",
    "since we are interested only in o / h and n / o , we can integrate out all other parameters and obtain the _ joint _ o / h and n / o posterior pdf .",
    "the joint pdf is simply a two - dimensional function that gives the probability of each point in the o / h versus n / o plane , which is the ultimate goal of bond .",
    "however , sometimes it is unpractical to work with the full joint pdf , so we need a summarised description in the form @xmath23 .",
    "there are many ways to transform a two - dimensional function into a nominal value and a dispersion .",
    "one way is to set the nominal value for n / o and o / h to be the point where the joint pdf is the highest .",
    "we call this number the maximum a posteriori ( map ) , because it is calculated after ( i.e.  a posteriori ) the marginalisation of nuisance parameters . for the dispersion",
    ", we can define ellipses of credible regions that encompass , say , 5 , 50 , 68 or 95% of the total joint pdf .",
    "if we want to marginalise away either o / h or n / o ( i.e.  if we are interested in one of those parameters alone ) , we can integrate over the other parameter .",
    "summarising the fully marginalised pdf also opens up a menu of choices .",
    "the nominal value can be taken as the mean , median or mode ( that is , its peak ) of the pdf .",
    "for the dispersion , the usual choices are either the 50 , 68 , or 95 percent equal - tailed or highest density intervals .",
    "note that the equal - tailed intervals are related to the median .",
    "the median is the point in the pdf curve where 50 percent of the probability is to the left and 50 to the right .",
    "the equal - tailed 68% interval is the region of a curve where 16 percent of the probability is to the right and 16 percent to the left .",
    "the highest density intervals , on the other hand , are related to the mode .",
    "the mode is the point in the curve of highest probability .",
    "the 68% highest density interval is the region around the mode that adds up to 68 percent of the total probability .",
    "a nice visualisation tool for those descriptions can be found at http://www.sumsar.net / blog/2014/10/probable - points - and - credible - intervals - part - one/.    another minor nuisance parameter we marginalise away are the uncertainties . for /h@xmath0 ,",
    "/h@xmath0and i he  i / h@xmath0 , we consider an extra noise source added in quadrature to the observational uncertainties which we allow to vary from 2 to 100 percent of the line intensity .",
    "the extra noise source is needed because , in nature , the ar / o and ne / o ratios may differ somewhat from the ones assumed in our model grid .",
    "regarding i he  i / h@xmath0 , the problem is that our grid is only coarsely meshed as regards the hardness of the ionizing radiation field .",
    "we then calculate the marginalised likelihood pdf for those lines by using all values of this extra noise and then marginalising it away .",
    "we do so because we do not expect those lines to be completely correct in our photoionization models , and they are used only to infer secondary parameters .",
    "we have highlighted the main characteristics of bond , a method based on a grid of photoionization models to measure oxygen and nitrogen abundances in giant hiiregions using strong and semistrong lines .",
    "we show why it is important to consider secondary parameters in abundance determinations , especially the hardness of the ionizing radiation field .",
    "the seds in hiiregions can vary from region to region due to stellar ageing or to the stochastically sampling of the imf .",
    "we also show how one can break the metallicity bimodality without recourse either to auroral lines or a fixed relation between n / o and o / h .",
    "we use a selective set of emission lines to infer all those parameters .",
    "finally , we argue why using bayesian inference is the correct way ( motivated by the dimensional analysis of probability density functions ) to treat the secondary parameters in abundance determinations .",
