    "the ion temperature gradient turbulence , considered a major source of anomalous transport in the tokamak plasma , is characterized by the coexistence of irregular patterns ( randomly fluctuating field ) and intermittent robust cuasi - coherent structures . in closely related fluid models ( for exemple , in the physics of atmosphere )",
    "modulational instabilities are known to produce solitary structures on the envelope of the fluctuating field . in the case of the tokamak",
    ", this can be particularly important since a poloidally nonuniform amplitude of the turbulence generates nonuniform transport rates .",
    "for a sufficiently high nonuniformity the torque arising via the mechanism initially mentioned by stringer @xcite may overcame the rotation damping due to the poloidal magnetic pumping . in this work",
    "we show that this can indeed be the case by proving that the uniform poloidal envelope of the itg turbulence is an unstable state .",
    "it appears that the itg turbulence has intrinsic resources to generate poloidal rotation via a combination of mechanisms which is not directly related to the reynolds stress , inverse cascade , direct - ion loss , or other classical sources of rotation .",
    "we provide an essentially mathematical explanation of the instability of the solution consisting of poloidally uniform envelope of the turbulence .",
    "based on the geometrico - algebraic method of solving integrable nonlinear differential equations on periodic domains we invoke an existing result , that any perturbation removes the degeneracies due to coincident eigenvalues in the main spectrum of the lax operator , thus changing the topology of the hyperelliptic riemann surface that provides the solution .",
    "the perturbed solution separates exponentially ( in function space ) from the initial one ( uniform envelope ) and this yields an exponential growth of the poloidal nonuniformity .",
    "the magnitude of the torque may be comparable to the poloidal magnetic damping .",
    "there are many works in plasma physics related to the soliton dynamics @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc . in a recent paper",
    "the focusing solution has been used to study the formation of coherent motion or intermittent patterns ( _ streamers _ ) @xcite .",
    "our work is basically a mathematical approach , using well developed technics related to the inverse scattering transform method for periodic domains .",
    "however , more physical analysis may become possible combining the knowledge of the spectral properties of the ion turbulence with the nonlinear stability properties .",
    "this work consists of several parts that may appear as developing separately : the derivation of the ion equation ( barotropic equation ) , the multiple space - time scales analysis , the solution of the nonlinear schrodinger equation and the stability of the solution , the torque arising from the stringer mechanism and the possibility of the rotation . for being",
    "self - contained the paper also includes a review of the multiple space - time analysis ( from the atmospheric physics applications ) and of the geometric - algebraic method of integration of the nonlinear schrodinger equation .",
    "even if these parts could be found in basic works ( see the references ) they are included both for clarity and for their extreme importance for further applications related to our problem or independent of this .",

    "the friction forces @xmath5 , which are important for the parallel electron momentum balance , vanish for infinite plasma conductivity , which we will assume . the collisional viscosity @xmath6 will be neglected as well .",

    "the equilibrium quantities are perturbed by the wave potential @xmath8 : @xmath9 .",
    "a sheared poloidal plasma rotation is included , and we later will make explicit the corresponding part in the potential , @xmath10 .",
    "the momentum conservation equations are used to determine the perpendicular velocities of the electrons and ions . the parallel momentum conservation equation for electrons , in the absence of _ dissipation _ or _ drifts _ gives the adiabatic distribution of the density fluctuation .",
    "the velocities are introduced in the continuity equations to find the dynamical equations for the density and electric potential .    from the equations of motion for the _ ions _",
    "the velocities are obtained in the form : @xmath11 where the ion diamagnetic velocity is @xmath12 the versor of the magnetic field is @xmath13 ; the versors along the transversal coordinate axis @xmath0 will be noted @xmath14 .",

    "we choose to fix the frequencies @xmath107 and consider @xmath106 as the parameter to be determined .",
    "the problem is complicated by the possible occurence of singularities in the potential due to resonances between the phase velocity and the fixed zonal flow .",
    "we will avoid any resonance since the physical content of the processes consisting of the direct energy transfer between the fluctuations and the flow represents a different physical problem and requires separate consideration . in the present work we examine the effect of the turbulence on the poloidal rotation as being due to the nonuniform diffusion rates and stringer mechanism .",

    "i.e. _ assuming arbitrary small nonzero values at these limits , since the solution decays exponentially .",
    "however most of the boundary value integrators we have tried gave amplitudes of magnitudes comparable to the boundary value , which essentially are homotopic to the trivial vanishing solution ( the equation is homogeneous ) and render useless this approach .",
    "we have to use a shooting method accepting the difficulty that the initial value of the parameter to be determined ( eigenvalue ) must be placed not far from the final value .",
    "we have used the specialized package sleign2 interactively . for the investigation of ranges of parameters",

    "this should simplify the task of integrator .",
    "a single matching point is assumed , usually at the centre .",
    "the tolerence is @xmath115 which however does not exclude fake convergence in case of an initialisation of the eigenvalue very far from the true solution ..",

    "taking @xmath628 and @xmath525 we obtain the frequency of steadily oscillating soliton @xmath629 , which is slower than the growth rate of the deformation , @xmath630 obtained above ( all in absolute units ) .",
    "since the rate of change of the poloidal velocity ( which will be calculated below ) has comparable magnitude with @xmath631 we conclude that the rotation has the time to develop before the oscillation reverses the sense of the applied torque .",
    "the maximum amplitude of the deformation is @xmath632 .",

    "we have to remember that the diffusion is a statistical process where a test particle interacting with fluctuating background field performs random displacements whose mean square grows linearly in time .",
    "the random displacements have to belong to a gaussian statistical ensemble and this requires that all kind of elementary experiences ( i.e. displacements ) to be represented with the corresponding probability .",

    "any average will be made on subensembles , more or less incomplete .",
    "the collection of field configurations are obtained from time _ and _ from space realizations of the field .",
    "the test particle should have the possibility to manifest the _ linear _ mean square displacement specific to the gaussian ensembles and this rises the question on what is the minimal spatial extension on which the average should be done .",

    "this should allow at least several random steps in the typical displacement of the particle .",
    "when we do this ( taking arbitrarly a factor of few units larger than the correlation length ) we note that the diffusion coefficient exhibits space variations .",
    "these are natural and are inherited from the space dependence of the radial eigenfunctions @xmath667 . since in real situations",
    "the radial eigenfunctions are superposed with random initial phases we need to enlarge the region of averaging over most of the radial interval considered , up to a level of saturation of these spatial variation which can be considered convenient for the estimation of the poloidal torque .",

    "the following quantity must be numerically calculated @xmath696 and this directly provides the rate of change of the poloidal velocity due to the asymmetry .",
    "this must be compared to the magnetic pumping term ( [ magnpump ] ) and we expect rotation instability when @xmath697 in this formula the soliton profile of the poloidal asymmetry is considered saturated and the motion of the solitons ( which would give periodic variation of the torque ) is neglected . as is shown in ref.@xcite the high positive second derivative of the density profile , combined with a dependence of the diffusion coefficient @xmath693 on the shear of the poloidal velocity are the favorable circumstances for the asymmetry - induced torque to overcome the magnetic pumping term and a spontaneous spin up to occur .",
    "we do not take into account the variation of @xmath693 with the velocity shear , but notice that the space variation of ( [ dtilda ] ) also contribute to obtain a positive value for @xmath698 sufficient for being comparable to @xmath699 and even to be larger .",
    "the most important contribution comes however from the positive - valued second density gradient , which can be seen as an indication that the spin - up can be expected in such region on the minor radius .",

    "appears clear the origin of the sensitivity to the perturbations , connected to the topology of a hyperelliptic riemann surface .",
    "the uniform solution is unstable and evolves to one of the soliton - type solution .",
    "the nonuniformity of the turbulence average profile generates a torque on the plasma , which may be sufficient to overcome the poloidal damping .",
    "the simple physical model we have employed may be partly justified by the observation that the analysis is essentially independent of the other possible sources of poloidal asymmetry : the neoclassical variation of parameters on the magnetic surface , the toroidal effect on the nonlinearity represented as mode coupling , the effect of the particle drifts on the linear and renormalized propagators , etc .",
    "the cubic nonlinear schrodinger equation has many solutions on the periodic domain and the relevance for the self - modulation of the envelope of the turbulence should be examined .",
    "here we only considered the uniform envelope since its instability can be sufficient to induce plasma poloidal rotation .",
    "this rotation has an origin different of the usual sources of rotation : neoclassical , ion - loss , reynolds stress or momentum injection .",
    "our approach is essentially mathematical and so it operates at a more formal level .",
    "the physical origin of the instability seems to be the tendency of the system ( averaged amplitude of the turbulence ) to evolve to profiles characterised by the balance of the dispersion and the nonlinearity .",
    "what remains to be examined is the quantitative constraint on the minimal initial perturbation needed to produce a particular evolution : for a weak perturbation the solution may be simple `` radiation '' while for initially larger amplitude a soliton emerges ensuring higher robustness and a localised form .",
