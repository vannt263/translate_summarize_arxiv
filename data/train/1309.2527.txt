    "the study of the properties of radio source populations above 10ghz has progressed greatly in recent years , fostered by cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observation campaigns that require an accurate understanding of the contamination of the cmb signal by foreground sources .",
    "extragalactic radio sources are the dominant contaminant on angular scales smaller than 30 arcmin , both in total intensity and in polarisation at frequencies of up to @xmath7@xmath8ghz ( toffolatti et al . 1998 ; 1999 ; de zotti et al .",
    "an accurate determination of their emission is therefore important to get clean cmb maps and is absolutely critical for the detection of the extremely weak cosmological b - mode polarisation ( see tucci & toffolatti 2012 for a recent review ) .",
    "extending the characterization of the polarisation properties of radio sources to high frequencies is interesting _ per s _ , as it provides information about the physics of the emission process . in compact ,",
    "doppler boosted sources that dominate the high - frequency population at bright flux density levels , the emission at higher and higher frequencies mostly arises from synchrotron , self - absorbed , knot - like structures in the relativistic jet closer and closer to the active nucleus ( e.g. blandford & knigl 1979 ) .",
    "it has been argued that the ordering of magnetic fields should increase in the inner regions , and as a consequence , the polarisation degree increases ( tucci et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "however , the polarisation properties of high - frequency extragalactic contaminants are still poorly constrained by observations .",
    "most current estimates rely on extrapolations from low - frequency samples ; the nvss at 1.4ghz ( condon et al . 1998 ) still constitutes the largest sample of sources surveyed both in total intensity and polarisation .",
    "extrapolations are affected by large uncertainties since a complex combination of effects must be considered .",
    "this includes intra - beam effects and bandwidth depolarisation , in addition to intrinsic frequency - dependent changes .",
    "the propagation of the radiation through diffuse plasma screens between the source and the observer can cause depolarisation and rotation of the polarisation angle .",
    "these effects are difficult to isolate observationally , although we can benefit from the inverse square frequency dependence of the latter effect .    because the polarised signal in extragalactic objects is typically a few percent of the total intensity signal , deep surveys are necessary to collect statistically significant samples . but high - frequency",
    ", deep surveys are time - consuming for diffraction - limited , ground - based telescopes .",
    "this has motivated sensitive high frequency polarisation measurements of source samples usually selected from surveys at @xmath95ghz ( klein et al .",

    "the study of polarisation properties of complete samples selected at @xmath10ghz has become possible thanks to the wmap all - sky survey with a completeness limit of @xmath11jy at 23 ghz ( argeso , gonzlez - nuevo , & toffolatti 2003 ; de zotti et al .",

    "table [ table : otherpolsurveys ] lists some details on the at20 g and wmap related samples that include data in polarisation .",
    "larger samples of radio sources selected at higher frequencies are being provided by the planck mission ( planck 2011a , b , 2013 ) .",
    "multi - steradian samples of high - frequency selected polarised sources are also important for identifying suitable calibrators for cmb polarimetric experiments and upcoming millimeter - wave telescopes .",
    "pictor a has been identified as a suitable extragalactic polarisation calibrator for the planck low frequency instrument ( lfi ) because of its position ( in the region of the ecliptic pole where the satellite scans @xmath5 once per minute ) and its lack of variability from the hot spots that dominate the polarised signal ( burke - spolaor et al . 2009 ) .",

    "sadler et al . ( 2006 ) presented polarisation measurements for a sample of 173 at20 g sources brighter than @xmath13mjy ; 129 ( @xmath14 ) were detected at 20 ghz , with a median fractional polarisation of 2.3% .",

    "the spectral indices in total intensity and in polarisation were found to be similar on average , but there were several sources for which the spectral shape of the polarised emission is substantially different from the spectral shape in total intensity . the full at20 g catalog ( murphy et al . 2010 ; massardi et al .",
    "2011a ) includes the 20 ghz polarised intensity for 768 sources , 467 of which also have simultaneous polarisation detections at 5 and/or 8 ghz , out of a total of 5890 sources .",

    "the measured polarisation fractions are typically @xmath23 , although in some cases they are measured to be up to @xmath24 . for sources with detected polarised flux in all four bands , about 40% of the sample",
    ", the polarisation fractions typically increase with frequency .",
    "this trend is stronger for steeper spectrum sources as well as for the lower flux density sources .",
    "the conclusions of all the polarisation studies of complete samples selected at high frequencies are limited by the moderate detection rates . to overcome this limitation",
    "we have performed dedicated high - sensitivity polarisation observations of a complete at20 g bright source sub - sample achieving a @xmath25 detection rate .",
    "in addition to allowing a more thorough investigation of the polarisation properties of the high - frequency radio source populations , this sample constitutes a legacy data set for polarisation studies in the southern hemisphere .",
    "in particular , this sample could help in the definition of calibrator source lists for facilities working in the millimetric bands , like the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) that , in its final configuration , will observe from 30 to 950ghz in both total intensity and polarisation .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in  [ sec : selection ] we describe the sample selection and the observing strategy , and in  [ sec : reduction ] the data reduction techniques . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we included the polarised flux density measurements in this analysis as well as limits for the extended sources as extracted from low resolution 9-year wmap maps described in ",
    "[ sec : wmap ] .",
    "the final sample thus includes 187 sources . in ",
    "[ sec : analysis ] we present the analysis of their spectral and polarisation properties . in  [ sec : counts ] we derive the source counts as a function of the polarised flux density . in  [ sec : cal ] we present a selection of candidate polarisation calibrators for millimetric wavelength studies .",
    "the main conclusions are summarised in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the selection of the sample was based on the list of confirmed at20 g sources available at the epoch of our observations ( october 2006 ) .",
    "we selected all objects with flux density @xmath26mjy and declination @xmath27 , excluding the galactic plane region ( @xmath28 ) and the large magellanic cloud region ( inside a circle of @xmath29 radius centered at @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) .",
    "this resulted in a complete sample of 189 sources .",
    "nine of them were found , with the aid of low frequency radio imaging surveys ( pmn , griffith & wright 1994 , 1995 , and sumss , mauch et al .",
    "2003 ) , to be very extended .",
    "these were observed with the mosaic mode at 20ghz by burke - spolaor et al .",
    "flux densities integrated over the whole source are available for 5 of them . for",
    "the remaining 4 objects the measured integrated flux densities , if available , refer to subregions . for these 4 objects we decided to extract the integrated flux densities from the low resolution wmap maps as described in sect .",
    "[ sec : wmap ] .",
    "it should be noted that the flux densities reported in the final published at20 g catalogue may be slightly different from those given in the preliminary 2006 version used for our source selection .",
    "the reason is that in the case of sources observed more than once ( which is most likely the case for bright sources such as those considered here ) the highest quality observation was listed in the final at20 g catalogue , as discussed by murphy et al .",
    "because of variability this has the effect of moving some sources above or below the adopted flux density threshold ( @xmath2mjy ) . since there are more sources below than above the threshold , there are more sources moving up than moving down , and we end up with slightly more sources above threshold in the final catalogue than in the version we have used .",
    "hence there are 214 sources listed in the final at20 g catalogue with declination @xmath27 and flux density above our chosen threshold .    on the other hand , of the 180 sources with good quality flux density in our atca observations ( as discussed below ) only 165 still have @xmath15mjy in the final catalogue and only 145 were found to be above this threshold in our october 2006 observations . however , despite variability , the final sample , which is reasonably complete at the selection epoch , is representative of the bright 20 ghz population as a whole and can be used to assess statistical properties of this population .",
    "observations were taken on october 1 , 2006 using the most compact hybrid configuration of atca , `` h75 '' , excluding the data from the farthest antenna .",
    "the longest baseline of this configuration is 75 m , and its t - shape ensures adequate fourier coverage for snapshots taken on a relatively small range of hour angles and at high elevation .",
    "although the linear feeds of the atca somewhat complicate the polarisation calibration procedure , the array has several inherent advantages for polarisation experiments .",
    "the on - axis receivers of the telescope introduce relatively low amounts of instrumental polarisation , while all antennae are fitted with a noise diode that injects a signal to continually track the phase difference ( xy - phase ) between the two orthogonal feeds .",
    "in addition , since the feeds are linearly polarised , there is very little contamination of the circular polarisation signal by the total intensity signal . for further details on the atca",
    "instrumental polarisation we refer readers to sault , reyner & kesteven ( 2002 ) .",
    "a digital correlator ( later replaced by the cabb broad - band digital correlator ) allowed simultaneous observations in two bands , each with a bandwidth of 128 mhz divided into 32 channels .",
    "the observation frequencies within the 20ghz band , covering the 16 - 24ghz range , were chosen so as to maximize sensitivity , make use of optimal system temperatures , and avoid correlator harmonics . the frequency bands were centered at 16.704 and 19.392ghz . after calibration , data were averaged over the 256 mhz band so that our mean effective frequency was 18.048ghz ( hereafter tagged as `` 18''ghz observations ) .",
    "the fov was @xmath32 arcmin .",
    "the closeness of dishes in the h75 configuration can cause significant antenna shadowing for sources south of a declination of approximately @xmath33 .",
    "because the effects of shadowing and cross - talk on polarisation measurements are unknown for the instrument , the sample for h75 observations was restricted to @xmath34 .",
    "eleven @xmath35 sources were observed for this project during a run that took place on 17th october 2006 with a more extended hybrid antenna configuration ( h214 ) and observation bands centered at 18.752 and 21.056ghz .",
    "calibration and observation setup for these objects matched that of at20 g follow - up observations ( see murphy et al .",
    "2010 for details ) . after the data reduction , the data for 3 of these objects ( at20gj115253 - 834410 , at20gj122454 - 831310",
    ", at20gj155059 - 825807 ) at 20 ghz were found to be of poor quality in this run .",
    "however , they had good quality observations and a polarisation detection in march 2006 during a previous at20 g follow - up run .",
    "hence , we decided to include these measurements in the present analysis , flagging them in the catalogue .",
    "for each run a bright point - like source was observed to calculate bandpass solutions and pks1934638 was used as the primary flux density calibrator .",
    "the sample was broken into groups of 46 sources , located in the same sky region . before each group",
    "was observed , an antenna pointing correction was performed using a nearby bright source to maintain directional accuracy despite the vast range of sky positions that the telescope had to observe in a short period of time . each target",
    "was observed in two 70-second snapshots separated by four hours .",
    "five targets were identified as extended within the primary beam , according to the extendedness criteria described in murphy et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . as the flux density estimation methods that we use (",
    "see sect.[sec : reduction ] ) are well suited for compact objects , the flux densities of extended sources are likely underestimated by an unknown amount and the polarised flux density is potentially wrong .",
    "for this reason they were included in the list of extended sources for which we extracted the polarisation information from the wmap 9-yr coadded maps ( see sect . [",
    "sec : wmap ] ) . in the end , after dropping 4 of the 9 very extended sources observed by burke - spolaor et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and the 5 sources found to be extended , we are left with 180 sources for which we have good quality atca data .",
    "five antennae were available in our 16.704 ghz band , while there was an error in the 19.392ghz band that left only four usable antennae at that frequency . to save observing time",
    ", no secondary calibrators were interleaved with the target observations , with the intention of self - calibrating each bright source during the data reduction . as described in sect .",
    "[ sec : reduction ] , this turned out to be an unwise strategy in terms of polarisation calibration .",
    "nevertheless , 169 of the 180 extragalactic sources in our atca observed sample ( 94% ) were detected in polarisation at 18 ghz .",
    "however , only 145 of them also have @xmath36 mjy in the october 2006 observations .",
    "table  [ table : fulltable ] provides an excerpt of the catalogue containing the data for the sample of 180 objects for which we have good quality atca data .",
    "lower - frequency observations were performed during a regular at20 g follow - up run ( described in murphy et al .",
    "2010 ) , carried out in november 2006 . in that epoch",
    ", we used a 5-antenna east - west array configuration , with a 1.5 km longest baseline .",
    "two 30-second observations per source provided simultaneous 4800 and 8640mhz snapshots .",
    "these observations had 128 mhz of bandwidth per frequency .",
    "the fov were of 9.9 and 5.5 arcmin , respectively .",
    "massardi et al .",
    "( 2011b ) demonstrated that the median variability of total intensity flux densities for sources in flux density ranges similar to those of our sample over 3 month timescale is 3.5 and 6.3 per cent respectively at @xmath37 and @xmath38 ghz , sligthly increasing with time lag .",
    "kurinski et al .",
    "( 2013 ) found a median variability index for total intensity flux densities of 1.0% at 5 ghz on less than 2 months time lags for a similar sample in the northern hemisphere .",
    "hence we could assume that our high and low frequency observation comparisons , on shorter time scales , are not substantially affected by variability for most sources .",
    "173 and 172 sources have good quality flux densities respectively at 4.8 and 8.6 ghz .",
    "172 sources have good quality flux densities at all the frequencies ( quality controls are described in murphy et al .",
    "2010 ) . of these",
    ", 137 have @xmath36 mjy in the october 2006 run .",
    "143 sources have a polarisation detection at all the frequencies ( 79% of the main sample ) , 119 of which have @xmath36 mjy in the october 2006 run .",
    "the 16.7 and 19.4ghz data were reduced using the miriad software package ( sault , teuben , & wright 1995 ) . the two frequencies were calibrated independently and then combined for 18ghz imaging and flux density assessment .",
    "opacity correction and a correction for the time - dependent instrumental xy - phase difference was applied upon loading all data into miriad . after this correction ,",
    "a small residual gain offset still remained to be corrected in the following calibration stages .",
    "bandpass solutions and primary flux density calibration were calculated and applied using pks1921293 and pks1934638 , respectively .    for polarimetric calibration with calibrators of unknown polarisation and sparse data ( such as in our short snapshot observations ) , the standard miriad procedure suggests calculating the largely stable instrumental leakage terms by using an unpolarised primary calibrator .",
    "the remaining polarisation and gain terms are then calculated for each secondary phase calibrator .",
    "roughly 75% of the sources in our sample are registered in the atca calibrator database ; all are sufficiently bright to determine adequate calibration solutions . however , though it is suggested that accurate q and u values could be calculated from a relatively small amount of data , it was apparent that this was not the case for our @xmath53 minute observations .",
    "many solutions failed , while others produced impossible values for q and u levels .",
    "this is likely due to the large number of free parameters and insufficient data length , even using the smallest possible solution interval . to overcome this hindrance ,",
    "all polarisation and gain solutions for the main sample were determined using the secondary calibrators that were interlaced in our observations , though these were originally intended for use with the objects presented by burke - spolaor et al .",
    "merged solutions from the eight available calibrators afforded an observation every 1 - 2 hours in various regions of the sky .",
    "because each was typically observed at least for one minute at any of eight parallactic angle intervals spanning approximately 6 hours , they had sufficient parallactic angle coverage to disentangle instrumental polarisation from the intrinsic calibrator stokes q and u levels .",
    "the absolute flux density scale calculated from pks1934638 was then used to bootstrap the secondary calibrators ; gain and instrumental polarisation terms were then applied to all target sources .",
    "incidentally , tests run on the calibrated sources to check levels of residual phase instability , which is usually due to imperfect phase calibration ( as given in percentage by dividing the source vector amplitude by its scalar amplitude ) showed that using calibrators observed frequently in time can give a better phase calibration than less frequently observed calibrators even if they are closer in space to the target source ( as shown by 0 - 20% residual decorrelation in our sample versus the 0 - 50% found in at20 g data over similar time scales and weather conditions ) .",
    "hence , in polarimetry experiments covering large areas of the sky , it appears more pertinent to have many observations of one calibrator throughout an observation and therefore have sufficient data to determine accurate polarisation solutions , despite possible non - proximity to target sources .",
    "however , calibrators in this experiment were never further than @xmath39 from any target source and were restricted to high elevation observations .    the 4.8 and 8.6ghz data for the main sample and the 20ghz data for the 11 @xmath40 sources had observational modes exactly coincident with the at20 g survey follow - up , and thus were flagged and reduced using the automatic pipeline developed for the at20 g ( murphy et al . 2010 ) .",
    "stokes - i intensities were determined from the visibilities to avoid the inclusion of phase instabilities inherent in image - based measurements . this technique takes the scalar average of the visibility amplitudes and is robust for bright ( @xmath41200mjy ) , point - like sources only .",
    "to acquire stokes @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 flux densities , images were created and deconvolved using the miriad task clean . to correct the stokes @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 images for decorrelation",
    ", we took advantage of the fact that stokes parameters , simultaneously measured , are affected by decorrelation originating in atmospheric phase instabilities ( as might be left after imperfect calibration ) .",
    "we can thus use the fractional level of residual decorrelation ( @xmath45 ) in stokes @xmath46 , calculated and applied to @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 flux densities as : @xmath47 @xmath48 where _ z _ represents stokes @xmath42 , @xmath43 or @xmath44 , @xmath49 is the scalar - averaged stokes i flux density , and @xmath50 and _ _ z__@xmath51 represent the values at the position of the peak stokes i emission in the relevant image .",
    "the image peak for all sources was sufficient to determine the decorrelated flux density measurements ; the pixel size was typically 10arcsec , and no sources in this subsample were extended significantly beyond this .",
    "the polarised intensity and the position angles were then calculated using standard first - order debiasing , where @xmath52 ( wardle & kronberg 1974 ; simmons & stewart 1985 ) . the last term , @xmath53 , is the rms noise in the stokes @xmath44 image .",
    "most extragalactic sources do not have significant levels of circular polarisation ; therefore the stokes @xmath44 signal is usually undetected or very low for all such sources .",
    "this point makes the noise level in stokes @xmath44 a reasonable estimate of the background noise level in the @xmath42 and @xmath43 images , and thus gives a good estimate for the debiasing correction .",
    "the polarisation angles are given by @xmath54 , and the linear polarisation degree , @xmath55 , is given in the percentage : @xmath56 .",
    "the rms scatter @xmath53 provided a measurement of the noise on the scalar average flux density of the order of 1 - 2% .",
    "telescope pointing inaccuracies , considering the @xmath515 arcsec pointing errors and the 18ghz primary beam response function are expected to cause a possible attenuation of up to 2% in all stokes parameters .",
    "errors in the primary flux density scaling from pks1934638 are estimated by comparing the online atca calibrator catalogue data at 18.496ghz to the high - frequency polynomial model used by miriad to calculate the scaling factor .",
    "the model predicts @xmath57jy at our observing frequency while the average of values measured in 2006 is @xmath58jy ; the calibration error in source flux densities is thus approximately 0.2% .",
    "given the much larger statistical errors in @xmath49 , we ignore this calibration error .",
    "the net error in total intensity is thus given by : @xmath59 errors in the stokes parameters @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 can arise from leakage of the much brighter stokes @xmath46 signal due to imperfections in the alignment of orthogonal receiver components .",
    "the correction of this effect using pks1934634 and an iterative leakage calculation using secondary calibrators results in a negligible error compared to the system noise .",
    "the noise term is calculated by propagation of errors through eqs .",
    "( [ eq : decorr ] ) and ( [ eq : decorrcorr ] ) .",
    "the main contributions to the global error come from the antenna pointing inaccuracy and from the noise estimated by the rms levels in off - source regions in the restored ] where @xmath60 is either @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "the error on the polarised intensity can then be derived as : @xmath61 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : decorrcorr ] ) .",
    "note that if @xmath62 ( as expected for low polarisation sources in noisy maps ) , then @xmath63 . we defined as a non - detection of a source @xmath64 , and used @xmath65 as the upper limit on the polarised flux density for such sources .",

    "the median values of the 4.88.6ghz and 8.618ghz spectral indices in polarisation are 0.20 and -0.16 respectively .",
