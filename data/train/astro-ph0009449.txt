    "the cores of protoneutron stars and core - collapse supernovae are unique environments in nature .",
    "they are characterized by mass densities of order @xmath4 g @xmath5 and temperatures that range from @xmath6 to @xmath7 mev . at these temperatures and densities neutrinos of all species",
    "are produced in proliferation via electron - positron annihilation ( @xmath8 ) , nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung , and plasmon decay ( @xmath9 ) . while these processes contribute for the electron types ( @xmath10s and @xmath11s ) , for them the charged - current absorption and emission processes @xmath12 and @xmath13 dominate .",
    "neutrino - electron and neutrino - nucleon scattering also contribute to the total opacity .",
    "all of these interactions combine to couple the neutrinos to dense nuclear matter , affecting energy transport from the core where the neutrinos are diffusive to the more tenuous outer layers where the neutrinos begin to free - stream .",
    "indeed , the neutrino heating in the semi - transparent region behind the shock is now thought to be an essential ingredient in igniting the supernova explosion itself @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a neutrino - driven protoneutron star wind is thought to be a general feature of the core - collapse phenomenon and has been proposed as a site for @xmath3-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "essential in understanding the mechanism of type - ii supernovae is an accurate prediction of the production spectrum for each neutrino species . to this end , in  2 we present results of a thermalization and equilibration study of @xmath14 and @xmath15 neutrinos in dense matter .    separately , in  3 we present preliminary results from calculations of steady - state protoneutron star winds in general relativity .",
    "we include velocity profiles , asymptotic entropies , and expansion timescales central in assessing this site as a candidate for @xmath3-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "for @xmath0 and @xmath1 neutrino types ( collectively ` @xmath0s ' ) , which carry away 50@xmath1660% of the @xmath17 ergs liberated during collapse and explosion , the prevailing opacity and production sources are @xmath0-electron scattering , @xmath0-nucleon scattering , @xmath18 annihilation , and nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung .",
    "the charged - current reactions dominate the electron - type transport so completely that we do not consider them here .",
    "our focus is on ( 1 ) the role of @xmath0-nucleon scattering relative to @xmath0-electron scattering in thermalizing @xmath0 neutrinos and ( 2 ) the importance of bremsstrahlung as compared with @xmath18 annihilation as a producer of @xmath19 pairs .",
    "supernova theorists had long held @xcite that @xmath0-nucleon scattering did not aid in thermalizing any neutrino species .",
    "while the process was included as a source of opacity @xcite it served only to redistribute the neutrinos in space , not in energy .",
    "in contrast , @xmath0-electron scattering was thought to dominate as a thermalizer of @xmath0s .",
    "in addition , the only @xmath19 pair production mechanisms employed in full supernova calculations were @xmath20 and plasmon decay ( @xmath21 ) @xcite .",
    "nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung , while recognized as a late - time cooling mechanism for more mature neutron stars @xcite , was neglected in supernova theory .",
    "recent developments , however , call both these practices into question and motivate a re - evaluation of these processes in the supernova context . in the last few years , analytic formulae for @xmath0-nucleon have been derived that include the full kinematics and final - state pauli blocking , at arbitrary nucleon degeneracy , at the temperatures and densities encountered in the core of a core - collapse supernova @xcite .",
    "these efforts reveal that the average energy transfer in @xmath0-nucleon scattering may surpass previous estimates by an order of magnitude and , hence , that this process may compete with @xmath0-electron scattering as an equilibration mechanism @xcite .",
    "similarly , estimates of the nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung rate have been obtained @xcite which indicate that this process can compete with @xmath18 annihilation in the dense core .    in order to compare these scattering and production processes directly ,",
    "we solve the boltzmann equation for the time evolution of the neutrino phase - space distribution function ( @xmath22 ) in an idealized system with no spatial or angular gradients .",
    "we consider an isotropic homogeneous thermal bath of scatterers and absorbers held at constant temperature , density , and electron fraction .",
    "for the scattering processes , we begin the equilibration calculation at @xmath23 with a @xmath0 distribution function with a characteristic temperature of twice that of the surrounding matter .",
    "we then evolve this distribution function using the full collision integral of the boltzmann equation , with the structure function formalism of burrows and sawyer ( 1998 ) @xcite and reddy _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) @xcite . when equilibrium is reached the final distribution is fermi - dirac , at the temperature of the surrounding matter , with chemical potential set by the initial neutrino number density ( @xmath24 ) , conserved to better than 0.0001% throughout the calculation . for the production and absorption processes we begin with zero phase - space occupancy for both @xmath0 and @xmath25 at all energies and let bremsstrahlung and @xmath18 annihilation each build an equilibrium distribution of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos .",
    "@xmath18 annihilation is calculated in a legendre polynomial expansion @xcite .",
    "the production rate via nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung is calculated in a one - pion exchange model with arbitrary nucleon degeneracy @xcite . as a check to the calculation",
    ", the final distribution should have a characteristic temperature of the ambient matter with zero neutrino chemical potential .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ one ] shows the thermalization rates for @xmath26 and @xmath27 scattering , defined in terms of the average energy transfer ( @xmath28 ) at that energy , in equilibrium .",
    "the calculation was performed with @xmath29 mev and @xmath30 g @xmath5 .",
    "these thermodynamic conditions are representative of the @xmath0 neutrinosphere , the semi - transparent regime where the neutrinos begin to decouple from the matter and free - stream to infinity .",
    "most noticeable in this graph is the fact that while @xmath27 scattering dominates at low energies ( @xmath31 mev ) , at modest and high energies @xmath26 scattering competes with or dominates thermalization . throughout our calculations , at a variety of densities , temperatures , and compositions , we find this behavior to be generic for the two scattering processes .",
    "indeed , the point where @xmath26 scattering begins to overwhelm @xmath27 scattering seems always to fall between approximately 10 and 20 mev .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ one ] reveals the same type of systematics for the production and absorption processes .",
    "in this case , however , we plot the total differential emissivity for nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung and @xmath18 annihilation in equilibrium for two different thermodynamic points taken from a one - dimensional core - collapse simulation @xcite .",
    "bremsstrahlung is clearly the dominant production mechanism at low neutrino energies . in the interior , at densities of order 10@xmath32 g @xmath5 , @xmath18 annihilation begins to compete only at neutrino energies above 50 mev . in our time - dependent calculations ,",
    "we find that bremsstrahlung always dominates production below 10 - 20 mev at all points in a representative collapse profile .",
    "a complete and self - consistent theory of the origin of all the elements has been the grand program of nuclear astrophysics since the field s inception .",
    "the @xmath3-process , or rapid neutron capture process , is a mechanism for nucleosynthesis by which seed nuclei neutron capture on timescales shorter than those for @xmath33 decay . with a sufficient neutron flux",
    ", capture continues to very neutron - rich isotopes and to the heaviest elements ( e.g. , eu , dy , th , and u ) producing unique abundance peaks at @xmath34 , 130 , and 195 @xcite . the @xmath3-process is only quelled when photodisintegration timescales approach those for neutron capture .",
    "after the intense neutron flux lessens , @xmath33 decay populates the primary stable isobar for a given atomic number .",
    "while the relevant nuclear physics is fairly well understood , the astrophysical site , which must exist in order to produce the elemental abundances we find in nature , is not known .",
    "the viability of a site for @xmath3-process nucleosynthesis hinges on three characteristics : the asymptotic entropy per baryon ( @xmath35 ) , the electron fraction ( @xmath36 ) , and the dynamical timescale ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "one proposed site is the protoneutron star wind that emerges after core collapse and shock reheating during a supernova @xcite .",
    "both numerical and analytic studies of the conditions in this neutrino - driven wind have been carried out previously @xcite .",
    "early calculations based on realistic supernova models produced interesting nucleosynthesis and appreciable @xmath3-process yields , but overproduced nuclei near @xmath38 ( @xmath39sr , @xmath40y , and @xmath41zr ) @xcite .",
    "this problem was overcome by fine - tuning @xmath36 in these simulations @xcite , but no consensus on the other parameters ( particularly , @xmath35 ) has yet been reached . the pioneering analytic work of ref .",
    "@xcite using simple wind models showed that entropies fell short by a factor of @xmath42 of those needed for the dynamic timescales and lepton fractions achieved .",
    "in other studies @xmath35 was artificially enhanced by a factor of @xmath43 to achieve proper solar @xmath3-process abundances @xcite .",
    "the fact that these calculations indicate an @xmath35 too low for @xmath3-process nucleosynthesis does not exclude the wind as a potential site .",
    "a slight increase in energy deposition after the wind s acceleration phase @xcite or the effects of general relativity have been shown to decrease @xmath37 and increase @xmath35 @xcite , both favorable to nucleosynthesis .",
    "recent general relativistic steady - state and hydrodynamical studies indicate that winds can generate all three @xmath3-process abundance peaks only when the protoneutron star is quite massive @xmath44 @xcite and the total neutrino luminosity large ( @xmath45 erg s@xmath46 ) .",
    "these condition produce modest entropies ( @xmath47 baryon@xmath46 k@xmath48 ) , but short @xmath49 ms .",
    "the wind equations can be reduced to three ordinary coupled , critical differential equations for the evolution of temperature ( @xmath50 ) , mass density ( @xmath51 ) , and velocity ( @xmath52 ) in radius .",
    "@xmath36 is held constant .",
    "solving these equations constitutes an eigenvalue problem .",
    "the eigenvalue sought is the mass outflow rate @xmath53 , or , alternatively , the critical radius ( @xmath54 ) where @xmath55 , the local speed of sound . in practice , we impose two boundary conditions at the protoneutron star surface ( @xmath56 ) , which we take to be the @xmath10 neutrinosphere : ( 1 ) @xmath57 and ( 2 ) @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the neutrino optical depth .",
    "a third constraint must be imposed if we are to close the system of equations .",
    "this we take to be the critical condition , @xmath55 , which defines the outer radial boundary .",
    "the system , now well - posed , can be solved using a relaxation technique on an adaptive radial grid @xcite .",
    "the code then adjusts the radial mesh in a newton - raphson sense in order to fulfill all boundary conditions simultaneously .",
    "once the critical point is determined , we use lhospital s rule to bridge it and then integrate to infinity using a simple runga - kutta scheme .",
    "the results of a preliminary and representative general relativistic calculation are shown in fig .",
    "the left panel shows velocity profiles for a variety of @xmath11 luminosities , for a protoneutron star mass @xmath60 and radius @xmath61 km .",
    "this range of neutrino luminosities is indicative of the first @xmath62 seconds of the protoneutron star s life .",
    "the right panel is a plot of the asymptotic entropy per baryon per boltzmann constant versus @xmath37 for the same protoneutron star .",
    "note that these calculations were carried out with constant @xmath63 .    in general , we find that higher entropies and shorter dynamical timescales result from the use of general relativity instead of newtonian gravity . for the 1.4 @xmath64 object",
    "we consider here , however , we do not achieve entropies and timescales appropriate for @xmath3-process nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "our results for equilibration via @xmath0-electron scattering and @xmath0-nucleon scattering demonstrate that the latter competes with or dominates the former as a thermalizer for neutrino energies @xmath65 mev for @xmath66 g @xmath5 at all temperatures . at neutrino energies @xmath67 mev ,",
    "the difference at all densities and temperatures is approximately an order of magnitude . for the production and absorption processes",
    ", we find that nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung , at the average energy of an equilibrium fermi - dirac distribution at the local temperature , is 2 orders of magnitude faster than @xmath18 annihilation at @xmath68 mev and @xmath69 g @xmath5 . only for @xmath70 g @xmath5 and @xmath71 mev",
    "does @xmath72 begin to compete with bremsstrahlung at all energies .",
    "we conclude from this study that the emergent @xmath0 and @xmath1 spectrum is ( 1 ) brighter and ( 2 ) softer than previously estimated @xcite .",
    "the former results from the inclusion of the new pair emission process , nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung .",
    "the latter is a consequence of both the increased energy coupling between the nuclear and neutrino fluids through @xmath0-nucleon scattering and the fact that bremsstrahlung dominates @xmath18 annihilation near the neutrinospheres at the lowest neutrino energies .",
    "in addition , our first step in the calculation of realistic protoneutron star wind models has been successful ; we have created a robust technique for solving the steady - state eigenvalue problem and have confirmed the results of other researchers qualitatively .",
    "we plan to explore the parameter space of protoneutron star winds exhaustively with an eye toward implementing full neutrino transport in a hydrodynamic simulation of wind emergence and evolution .",
