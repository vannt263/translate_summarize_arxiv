    "<S> , we discuss the relation between transport and electron - configuration .    a half - filled double quantum dot with interdot repulsion has been theoretically studied @xcite and some interesting phenomena , for example , quantum phase transition at a critical interdot repulsion @xcite , have been predicted . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> focusing on two kind of conductance through a half - filled double quantum dot with interdot repulsion , we discuss the relation between transport and electron - configuration of double quantum dot through the behavior of the local charge and some thermodynamic quantities , on the basis of numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider two - site hubbard model with interdot repulsion , which is connected to two non - interacting leads at the left(l ) and right(r ) by the symmetrical tunneling matrix elements @xmath8 , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( a ) .     schematic picture of ( a ) series configuration with two terminals and ( b ) parallel configuration with four terminals , width=377,height=151 ]    the hamiltonian is given by @xmath9 with @xmath10    where @xmath11 annihilates an electron with spin @xmath12 at site @xmath13 in the double quantum dot , which is characterized by the interdot hopping matrix element @xmath0 , onsite energy @xmath14 , intradot repulsion @xmath1 and interdot repulsion @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in the lead at @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , the operator @xmath17 creates an electron with energy @xmath18 corresponding to an one - particle state @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the linear combinations of the conduction electrons @xmath20 and @xmath21 mixed with the electrons in dots labeled by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the position at the interface in the lead @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the hybridization strength @xmath26 is a constant independent of the frequency @xmath27 and @xmath15 , and take the fermi energy @xmath28 to be @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> our system has an inversion symmetry , so we can introduce the even and odd - parity orbitals as follows ; @xmath30 two phase shifts @xmath31 and @xmath32 of the quasi - particles with even and odd parities characterize a local fermi - liquid behavior of the whole system described by @xmath33 at low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we can obtain @xmath31 and @xmath32 from the fixed - point eigen values of nrg . from two phase shifts defined with respect to the system described by @xmath33 </S>",
    "<S> , we can deduce not only the conductance @xmath34 in the two - terminal series configuration illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( a ) but also the conductance @xmath35 in four - terminal parallel configuration illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( b ) at @xmath36 as follows ; @xmath37 we calculate series conductance @xmath34 , parallel conductance @xmath35 , electron number @xmath38 in even - parity orbital defined by eq.([eo - o ] ) and some thermodynamic quantities at half - filling ( @xmath39 ) for @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in this paper , we fix @xmath42 to be @xmath43 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , ( a ) @xmath34 , ( b ) @xmath35 and ( c ) @xmath44 are plotted as functions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , to make discussion clear , we consider three limit case ; case 1 : @xmath45 and @xmath46 , case 2 : @xmath47 and @xmath46 , and case 3 : @xmath45 and @xmath48 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) , we illustrate schematic picture of electron - configuration in double quantum dot for these three limit case . in the case 1 , because of no interaction between two dots , our system is decoupled to two same systems composed of a single dot connected to a single lead . at half - filling , each single dot is occupied by one electron to avoid intradot repulsion @xmath1 , as shown in the picture [ case 1 ] in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> schematic picture [ case 2 ] in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) represents that two electrons occupy the even - parity orbital stabilized by large interdot hopping @xmath0 in the case 2 . </S>",
    "<S> so , we can expect that the electronic states of the @xmath49 region in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](c ) are similar to the state of the case 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the case 3 have been studied in detail by galpin _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ using nrg@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> either of two dot is occupied by two electrons to avoid strong interdot repulsion @xmath2 which is much larger than intradot repulsion @xmath1 , as shown in the picture [ case 3 ] in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a degenerate configuration of two electrons results in non - fermi liquid ground state with @xmath50 residual entropy . from fig </S>",
    "<S> .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) and above discussion , we find that the series conductance @xmath34 almost reaches a unitary limit value @xmath7 only around cross - over regions of electron - configuration in double quantum dot . </S>",
    "<S> next , we discuss the parallel conductance @xmath35 in three limit cases . from the similar discussion for two - terminal series configuration </S>",
    "<S> , we can easily understand the schematic pictures of electron - configuration in four - terminal parallel configuration for three limit case , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) . for the case 1 , </S>",
    "<S> our system is decoupled to two same systems composed of single - dot connected to two leads . in each system </S>",
    "<S> , one electron occupies single dot as shown in the picture [ case 1 ] in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) , and causes kondo effect . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the parallel conductance @xmath35 reaches a unitary limit value equal to @xmath6 of two conducting modes . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) , we indeed find that there is plateau of the parallel conductance @xmath35 , which almost reaches a unitary limit value @xmath6 , for small values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the even - parity bonding orbital of double - dot is fully occupied by the two electrons in the case 2 . in the case 3 , two electrons fully occupy either of two dots and no electron occupies the other , as shown in the picture [ case 3 ] in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the parallel conductance in both case 2 and 3 is 0 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the fact that the parallel conductance for large values of @xmath4 or @xmath5 is suppressed to almost zero , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) is consistent with the phase diagram obtained by mravlje _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ using gunnarsson and schnhammer projection - operator method @xcite , apart from details .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider also impurity entropy @xmath51 and impurity spin susceptibility @xmath52 calculated using nrg eigen - energy . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , we show the temperature dependence of ( a ) impurity entropy @xmath51 and ( b ) @xmath53 for three points in @xmath54 plane shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig2](c ) ; @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . for @xmath55 , </S>",
    "<S> impurity entropy shows steps of ln4 at @xmath58 and vanishes as temperature decreases . </S>",
    "<S> there is a corresponding shoulder in impurity susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> it implies that the ln4 step originates from the degree of spin freedom . </S>",
    "<S> we can understand these thermodynamic behavior from consideration of the case 1 . </S>",
    "<S> each @xmath59 -  spin in single dot of two same systems for the case 1 is screened by kondo effect in the same manner . </S>",
    "<S> therefore total entropy 2@xmath60ln2=ln4 decays to 0 all at once . </S>",
    "<S> the impurity entropy and susceptibility for @xmath56 decrease and vanish at high - temperature @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because , in the case 2 assigned for @xmath56 , the even - parity bonding orbital of double - dot stabilized by large hopping @xmath0 is fully occupied by the two electrons and the freedom of spin and orbital are quenched at @xmath61 . for @xmath57 , </S>",
    "<S> a plateau of ln2 is seen in the impurity entropy as temperature decreases . </S>",
    "<S> the impurity spin susceptibility dose not change around temperature region @xmath62 where the impurity entropy begins to drop from ln2 to 0 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we find that the ln2 entropy is made up of the degree of orbital freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the ln2 plateau corresponds to non - fermi liquid ground state with residual entropy in the case 3 . </S>",
    "<S> but for @xmath57 , a finite @xmath0 results in fermi liquid ground state and thereby the impurity entropy vanishes as temperature is lowered .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , we have studied transport through a half - filled double quantum - dot with interdot repulsion in two - terminal series and four - terminal parallel configuration , the electron number in even - parity orbital , impurity entropy and spin susceptibility , using nrg method . through the behavior of these quantities , we have presented the relation between transport and electron - configuration of double quantum dot in wide parameter region .    </S>",
