    "quantum dot spin qubits are among the most promising and most intensively investigated building blocks of possible future solid state quantum computation systems @xcite .",
    "one of the major limitations of the decoherence time of the confined electron spin is its interaction with surrounding nuclear spins by means of hyperfine interaction @xcite . for reviews",
    "the reader is referred to refs .",
    "apart from this adverse aspect , hyperfine interaction can act as a resource of quantum information processing @xcite . for the above reasons it is of key interest to understand the hyperfine induced spin dynamics .",
    "most of the work into this direction , for single as well as double quantum dots , has been carried out under the assumption of a strong magnetic field coupled to the central spin system .",
    "this allows for a perturbative treatment or a complete neglect of the electron - nuclear `` flip - flop '' part of the hamiltonian , yielding great simplification @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we consider the case of zero magnetic field where such approximations fail , and we therefore concentrate on exact methods .    in the case of a single quantum dot spin qubit the usual hamiltonian describing hyperfine interaction with surrounding nuclei is integrable by means of bethe ansatz as devised by gaudin several decades ago@xcite . in the following",
    "we shall refer to that sytem also as the gaudin model .",
    "nevertheless exact results are rare also here because the bethe ansatz equations are very hard to handle .",
    "hence there are mainly three different routes in order to gain some exact results : ( i ) restriction of the initial state to the one magnon sector @xcite , ( ii ) restriction to small system sizes enabling progress via exact numerical diagonalizations @xcite , and ( iii ) restrictions to the hyperfine coupling constants @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will follow the third route and study in detail the electron spin as well as the entanglement dynamics in a double quantum dot model with partially homogeneous couplings : the hyperfine coupling constants are chosen to be equal to each other , whereas the exchange coupling is arbitrary . although the assumption of homogeneous hyperfine constants ( being the same for each spin in the nuclear bath ) is certainly a great simplification of the true physical situation , models of this type offer the opportunity to obtain exact , approximation - free results which are scarce otherwise .",
    "moreover , such models have been the basis of several recent theoretical studies leading to concrete predictions @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model ] we introduce the hamiltonian of the hyperfine interaction and derive the spin and entanglement dynamics for homogeneous hyperfine coupling constants . in sec .",
    "[ dynamics ] we study the spin and entanglement dynamics for different exchange couplings and bath polarizations .",
    "for the completely homogeneous case of the exchange coupling being the same as the hyperfine couplings we find an empirical rule describing the transition from low polarization dynamics to high polarization dynamics .",
    "the latter shows a jump in the amplitude when varying the exchange coupling away from complete homogenity .",
    "this effect as well as features like the periodicity of the dynamics are explained by analyzing the level spacings and their contributions to the dynamics . in sec .",
    "[ decoherence ] we extract the decoherence time from the dynamics by investigating the scaling behaviour of the short time electron spin dynamics .",
    "the result turns out to be in good agreement with experimental findings .",
    "the hyperfine interaction in a system of two quantum dot spin qubits is described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the exchange coupling between the two electron spins @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , @xmath5 are the coupling parameters for their hyperfine interaction with the surrounding nuclear spins @xmath6 .    in a realistic quantum dot",
    "these quantities are proportional to the square modulus of the electronic wave function at the sites of the nuclei and therefore clearly spatially dependent @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the volume of the unit cell containing one nuclear spin and @xmath9 is the electronic wave function of electron @xmath10 at the site of @xmath11-th nucleus . the quantity @xmath12 denotes the hyperfine coupling strength which depends on the respective nuclear species through the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that these can have different lengths . in a gaas quantum dot for example",
    "all ga and as isotopes carry the same nuclear spin @xmath13 , whereas in an inas quantum dot the in isotopes carry a nuclear spin of @xmath14 @xcite . in any case",
    "the hamiltonian obviously conserves the total spin @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the model to be studied in this paper now results by neglecting the spatial variation of the hyperfine coupling constants and choosing them to be equal to each other @xmath18 .",
    "variation of the exchange coupling between the two central spins @xmath1 then gives rise to an inhomogeneity in the system .",
    "hence the two electron spins are interacting with a common nuclear spin bath .",
    "moreover , if small variations of the coupling constants would be included , degenerate energy levels would slightly split and give rise to a modified _ long - time _ behavior of the system . in our quantitative studies to be reported on below ,",
    "however , we focus on the _ short - time _ properties where decoherence phenomena take place .",
    "indeed , in section [ decoherence ] we obtain realistic @xmath19 decoherence time scales in an almost analytical fashion .    in consistency with the homogenous couplings we choose the length of the bath spins to be equal to each other .",
    "for simplicity we restrict the nuclear spins to @xmath20 .",
    "we expect our results to be of quite general nature not strongly depeding on this choice @xcite",
    ". note that both , the square @xmath21 of the total central spin as well as the square @xmath22 of the total bath spin are separately conserved quantities .    considering the two electrons to interact with a common nuclear spin bath as in our model corresponds to a physical situation where the electrons are comparatively near to each other .",
    "this leads to the question whether our model is also adapted to the case of two electrons in one quantum dot , rather than in two nearby quantum dots . assuming perfect confinement , in the former case one of the two electrons would be forced into the first excited state , which typically has a zero around the dot center .",
    "thus , the coupling constants near the very center of the dot would clearly be different for the two electrons .",
    "therefore our model is more suitable for the description of two electrons in two nearby quantum dots than for the case of two electrons in one dot .",
    "let us now turn to the exact solution of our homogeneous coupling model and calculate the spin and entanglement dynamics from the eigensystem . in what follows we shall work in subspaces of a fixed eigenvalue of @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the expectation values of the @xmath24- and @xmath25-components of the central and nuclear spins vanish , and we only have to consider their @xmath26-components .    if all hyperfine couplings are equal to each other @xmath18 , the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) can be rewritten in the following way @xmath27 with @xmath28 omitting the quantum numbers corresponding to a certain clebsch - gordan decomposition of the bath , the eigenstates are labelled by @xmath29 associated with the operators @xmath30 .",
    "the two central spins couple to @xmath31 .",
    "hence the eigenstates of @xmath32 are given by triplet states @xmath33 , corresponding to the coupling of a spin of length one to an arbitrary spin , and a singlet state @xmath34 .",
    "the explicit expressions are given by ( [ eig1 ] , [ eig2 ] , [ eig3 ] ) in appendix a.    the corresponding eigenvalues read as follows :    [ 4 ] @xmath35    now we are ready to evaluate the time evolution of the central spins and their entanglement from the eigensystem of the hamiltonian .",
    "we consider initial states @xmath36 of the form @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is an arbitrary central spin state and @xmath39 is a product of @xmath40 states @xmath41 .",
    "the physical significance of this choice becomes clear by rewriting the electron - nuclear coupling parts of the hamiltonian in terms of creation and annihilation operators : @xmath42 obviously the second term does not contribute to the dynamics for initial states which are simple product states .",
    "hence by considering initial states of the above form , we mainly study the influence of the flip - flop part on the dynamics of the system .",
    "this is exactly the part which is eliminated by considering a strong magnetic field like in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as the @xmath43 dimensional bath hilbert space is spannend by the @xmath44 eigenstates , every product state can be written in terms of these eigenstates . if @xmath45 is the number of down spins in the bath , it follows    @xmath46    where the quantum numbers @xmath47 are due to a certain clebsch - gordan decomposition of the bath . in ( [ 8 ] )",
    "we assumed the first @xmath48 spins to be flipped , which is no loss of generality due to the homogeneity of the couplings .",
    "for the following discussions it is convenient to introduce the bath polarization @xmath49 .    using ( [ 8 ] ) and inverting ( [ eig1 ] , [ eig2 ] , [ eig3 ] ) , the time evolution can be calculated by writing @xmath36 in terms of the above eigenstates and applying the time evolution operator . using ( [ eig1 ] , [ eig2 ] , [ eig3 ] ) again and tracing out the bath degrees of freedom we arrive at the reduced density matrix @xmath50 , which enables to evaluate the expectation value @xmath51 and the dynamics of the entanglement between the two central spins .    as a measure for the entanglement we use the concurrence @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the eigenvalues of the non - hermitian matrix @xmath54 in decreasing order . here",
    "@xmath55 is given by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath50 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath58 are of course products of clebsch - gordan coefficients , which enter the time evolution through the quantity @xmath59 and usually have to be calculated numerically .",
    "the main advantage in considering @xmath20 is now that in this case a closed expression for @xmath60 can be derived @xcite : @xmath61    for further details on the calculation of the time dependent reduced density matrix and the dynamical quantities derived therefrom we refer the reader to appendix b.    finally , it is a simple but remarkable difference between our one bath system with two central spins and the homogeneous gaudin model of a single central spin @xcite , that even if we choose @xmath39 as an @xmath44 eigenstate and hence fix @xmath62 in ( [ 8 ] ) to a single value , due to the higher number of eigenvalues the resulting dynamics can not be described by a single frequency .",
    "we now give an overview over basic dynamical features of the system considered . due to the homogeneous couplings ,",
    "the dynamics of the two central spins can be read off from each other .",
    "hence the following discussion of the dynamics will be restricted to @xmath63 .      in figs .",
    "[ fig : evenodd1 ] , [ fig : evenodd2 ] we consider the completely homogeneous case @xmath64 and plot the dynamics for @xmath65 and varying polarization @xmath66 .",
    "a polarization of @xmath67 does not seem to be particularly high , but the behavior typical for high polarizations occurs indeed already at such a value .",
    "we omit the singlet case because it is an eigenstate of the system . in fig .",
    "[ fig : evenodd1 ] the number of spins is even , whereas in fig . [ fig : evenodd2 ] an odd number is chosen .",
    "note that we measure the time @xmath68 in rescaled units @xmath69 depending on the number of bath spins @xcite .",
    "similarly to the homogeneous gaudin system @xcite , from figs .",
    "[ fig : evenodd1 ] , [ fig : evenodd2 ] we see that the dynamics for an even number of spins is periodic with a periodicity of @xmath70 ( in rescaled time units ) , whereas an odd number of spins leads to a periodicity of @xmath71 .",
    "this is the case for @xmath1 being any integer multiple of @xmath72 .",
    "these characteristics can of course be explained by analyzing the level spacings in the different situations .",
    "for example , for an even number of bath spins , all level spacings are even multiples of @xmath73 @xcite , resulting in dynamics periodic with @xmath70 . however ,",
    "if the number of spins is odd , we get even and odd level spacings ( in units of @xmath73 ) , giving a period of @xmath71 . for the given case of completely homogeneous couplings",
    "the dynamics can be nicely characterized : the number of local extrema for an even number of bath spins within a complete period , as well as for an odd number of bath spins within half a period , is in both cases given by @xmath74 .",
    "this  so far empirical  rule holds for all initial central spin states and is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : evenodd1 ] and [ fig : evenodd2 ] .",
    "let us now investigate the spin dynamics for varying exchange coupling , i.e. the case @xmath75 .",
    "note that for the initial central spin state @xmath76 this inhomogeneity has no influence on the spin dynamics since @xmath77 is an eigenstate of @xmath78 and @xmath79=0.\\ ] ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : evenoddj1 ] the dynamics for @xmath80 and varying exchange coupling is plotted . in the upper two panels we consider the case of low polarization @xmath81 for an even and an odd number of spins .",
    "the remaining two panels show the dynamics for high polarization @xmath82 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : evenoddj2 ] the plots are ordered likewise for a more general linear combination of @xmath83 and @xmath77 , @xmath84 .    from figs .",
    "[ fig : evenoddj1 ] , [ fig : evenoddj2 ] we see that if the exchange coupling is an odd multiple of @xmath73 , the even - odd effect described above does not occur and we have periodicity of @xmath71 . in both of the aforementioned situations the time evolutions are symmetric with respect to the middle of the period , which is a consequence of the invariance of the underlying hamiltonian under time reversal . for a more general exchange coupling , the periodicity , along with the mirror symmetry , of the dynamics",
    "is broken on the above time scales .    considering the case of low polarization , neither the dynamics of initial states with a product nor the one of states with an entangled central spin state dramatically changes if @xmath1 is varied",
    "however , if the polarization is high , the spin is oscillating with mainly one frequency proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore the amplitude of the oscillation is larger for the case @xmath75 than for the completely homogeneous case .",
    "this behaviour can be understood as follows : if the polarization is high @xmath85 , whereas @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "this means that calculating the spin and entanglement dynamics , we only have to consider the term @xmath88 .",
    "an evaluation of the coeffcients for the different frequencies now shows that the main contribution results from @xmath89 in obvious notation . hence if the polarization is more and more increased ,",
    "this is the only frequency left .",
    "if @xmath90 , the two associated eigenstates are degenerate so that in this case the main contribution to the dynamics is constant .",
    "this explains why the amplitude of the high polarization dynamics in figs .",
    "[ fig : evenoddj1 ] , [ fig : evenoddj2 ] is big compared to the one in figs .",
    "[ fig : evenodd1 ] , [ fig : evenodd2 ] . for further details the reader",
    "is referred to appendix b.      in figs .",
    "[ fig : con_hom1 ] , [ fig : con_hom ] the concurrence dynamics @xmath91 for @xmath92 is plotted for the same polarizations as in figs . [ fig : evenoddj1 ] , [ fig : evenoddj2 ] and varying exchange coupling .",
    "it is interesting that in the second case the concurrence drops to zero for certain periods of time .",
    "this is very similar for the case @xmath76 not shown above . as already explained concerning the spin dynamics , the exchange coupling @xmath1 of course has no influence because @xmath93 is an eigenstate of @xmath78 .",
    "it is an interesting fact now that for @xmath80 and a small polarization changing from @xmath94 to @xmath95 increases the maximum value of the function @xmath91 .",
    "furthermore we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : con_hom1 ] that surprisingly the entanglement is much smaller for the completely homogeneous case @xmath96 than for @xmath75 even for low polarization .",
    "depending on the choice of the exchange coupling , the dynamics of the one bath model can either be symmetric and periodic or without any regularities .",
    "it is now not entirely obvious to determine in how far these dynamics constitute a process of decoherence .",
    "considering for example the spin dynamics for an integer @xmath1 and an even number of bath spins shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : evenodd1 ] , one can either regard the decay of the spin as decoherence or , especially due to the symmetry of the function , as part of a simple periodic motion . in ref .",
    "@xcite the first zero of @xmath63 has been considered as a measure for the decoherence time . in fig .",
    "[ fig : jsubzero ] we illustrate examples of the spin dynamics on short time scales for @xmath97 , @xmath98 and a varying number of bath spins . for @xmath97",
    "this procedure is straightforward meaning that @xmath63 crosses the horizontal line @xmath99 before reaching its first minimum with @xmath100 .",
    "however , for @xmath98 and a sufficiently small number of bath spins , as seen from the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : jsubzero ] , such a first minimum is attained before the first actual zero @xmath101 .",
    "this first zero occurs indeed at much large times @xmath68 whose scaling behavior as a function of system size @xmath40 is clearly different from the zero positions found for @xmath97 , as we have checked in a detailed analysis .",
    "thus , our evaluation scheme needs to be modified for @xmath98 . an obvious way out of this problem is to either consider large enough spin baths where such an effect does not occur , or to evaluate the intersection with alternative `` threshold level '' @xmath102 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : jsubzero ] we have chosen @xmath103 , which will be the basis of our following investigation . as a further alternative , one could also consider the position of the first minimum of @xmath63 . hence , strictly speaking , it is not per se the first zero of @xmath100 which is a measure for the decoherence time , but the scaling behavior of the dynamics on short time scales .",
    "following the route described above , in fig .",
    "[ fig : scale ] we plot the positions ( measured in units of @xmath69 ) of the first zeroes of @xmath63 for @xmath97 , and of the first intersections with the threshold level shown in fig . [ fig : jsubzero ] for @xmath98 , on a double logarithmic scale .",
    "we choose a weakly polarized bath @xmath104 , approaching the completely unpolarized case for @xmath105 .",
    "the absolute values of the positions for @xmath97 and @xmath98 differ slightly from each other , which results from the fact that the intersection with the threshold level at @xmath106 happens closer to zero than with the usual threshold level @xmath99 .",
    "nevertheless , the scaling behavior is very similar in all cases , and each curve can nicely be fitted by a power law @xmath107 with @xmath108 , a result similar to the one found for the homogeneous gaudin system with only one central spin @xcite .    in a gaas quantum dot",
    "the electron spins usually interact with approximately @xmath109 nuclei . assuming the hyperfine coupling strength to be of the order of @xmath110ev , as realistic for gaas quantum dots @xcite , this results in a time scale of @xmath111s .",
    "if we now use the above scaling behaviour @xmath112 , we get a decoherence time of @xmath113ns , which fits quite well with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "this is an interesting result not only with respect to the validity of our model : as explained following equation ( [ flipflop ] ) , generally decoherence results `` directly '' from the electron - nuclear flip - flop terms and through the superposition of product states from the z terms .",
    "above we calculate the decoherence time for @xmath114 , where the influence of the z terms is eliminated .",
    "the fact that we are able to reproduce the decoherence times suggests that the decoherence time caused by the flip - flop terms is equal or smaller than the one resulting from the z parts of the hamiltonian .",
    "it should be stressed that we calculate the decoherence time of an individual electron @xmath115 here . in ref .",
    "@xcite the decoherence time of an ensemble of dots @xmath116 has been calculated yielding @xmath117ns for a gaas quantum dot with @xmath118 nuclear spins .",
    "it is now a well - known fact for the gaudin system that the decaying part of the dynamics decreases with increasing polarization @xcite .",
    "a numerical evaluation shows that this is also the case for two central spins .",
    "as explained in the context of figs .",
    "[ fig : evenodd1 ] , [ fig : evenodd2 ] , [ fig : evenoddj1 ] , [ fig : evenoddj2 ] the oscillations of our one bath model become more and more coherent with increasing polarization .",
    "together with the above results for the decoherence this means that , although the homogeneous couplings are a strong simplification of the physical reality , our homogeneous coupling model shows rather realistic dynamical characteristics on the relevent time scales .",
    "this is plausible because artifacts of the homogeneous couplings , like the periodic revivals , set in on longer time scales .",
    "in conclusion we have studied in detail the hyperfine induced spin and entanglement dynamics of a model with homogeneous hyperfine coupling constants and varying exchange coupling , based on an exact analytical calculation .",
    "we found the dynamics to be periodic and symmetric for @xmath1 being an integer multiple of @xmath72 or an odd multiple of @xmath73 , where the period depents on the number of bath spins .",
    "we explained this periodicity by analyzing the level spectrum .",
    "for @xmath64 we found an empirical rule which charaterizes the dynamics for varying polarization .",
    "we have seen that for low polarizations the exchange coupling has no significant influence , whereas in the high polarization case the dynamics mainly consists of one single frequency proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "it is not possible to entangle the central spins completely in the setup considered in this article .    following ref .",
    "@xcite we extracted the decoherence time by analyzing the scaling behaviour of the first zero . in the case of negative exchange coupling the dynamics strongly changes on short time scales and instead of the first zero we considered the intersection of the dynamics with another threshold level parallel to the time axis .",
    "both cases yield the same result which is in good agreement with experimental data .",
    "hence the scaling behaviour of the short time dynamics can be regarded as a good indicator for the decoherence time .",

    "the eigenstates of @xmath119 can be found directly by iterating the well known expressions@xcite for coupling an arbitrary spin to a spin @xmath120 .",
    "two of these states lie in the triplet sector :    @xmath121    as already mentioned in the text , the states are labelled by the quantum numbers @xmath29 corresponding to the operators @xmath122 .",
    "the rest of the quantum numbers due to a certain clebsch - gordan decomposition of the bath is omitted . for the eigenstates of the central spin term @xmath78 we used the standard notation :    [ trip ] @xmath123    the remaining two eigenstates are superpositions of singlet and triplet states .",
    "as the expressions are rather cumbersome , it is convenient to introduce the following notation in order to abbreviate the clebsch - gordan coefficients :    @xmath124    with this definitions the superposition states can be written as:@xmath125 @xmath126 these states are degenerate with respect to @xmath119 , hence we are left with the simple task to find a superposition of @xmath127 and @xmath128 , which eliminates @xmath129 .",
    "obviously this is given by @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the normalization constant .",
    "inserting @xmath127 and @xmath128 this reads : @xmath132 together with the singlet state @xmath133 this solves our problem of diagonalizing the one bath homogeneous coupling hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore ( [ eig1 ] ) and ( [ eig2 ] ) give a solution to the very general problem of coupling an arbitrary spin to a spin @xmath134 .",
    "let @xmath32 be a time - independent hamiltonian acting on a product hilbert space @xmath135 .",
    "we denote its eigenvectors by @xmath136 and the corresponding eigenvalues by @xmath137 . in the following",
    "we calculate the time - dependent reduced density matrix for an initial state which is a pure state and derive the time evolution @xmath138 associated with an operator @xmath139 acting on @xmath140 .",
    "then we consider the hamiltonian ( [ 5 ] ) and give some more details on the corresponding calculations for our model .    as the eigenstates of @xmath32 span",
    "the whole hilbertspace @xmath141 , the initial state @xmath36 of the system described by @xmath32 can be written as @xmath142 the time evolution of the initial state results from the application of the time evolution operator @xmath143 .",
    "it follows : @xmath144 as @xmath139 acts on @xmath140 , the other degrees of freedom have to be traced out @xmath145 finally giving the time evolution of the operator : @xmath146 usually such calculations are done numerically , but for our homogeneous coupling model it is possible to derive exact analytical expressions for the dynamics of the two central spins .",
    "following the general scheme , we have to write the initial state in terms of energy eigenstates first .",
    "as explained in the text , we consider @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is an arbitrary central spin state and @xmath39 is a product state in the bath hilbertspace @xmath147 . using ( [ 8 ] ) it follows :      the eigenstates ( [ eig1 ] , [ eig2 ] , [ eig3 ] ) are given in terms of product states between a basis element from ( [ trip ] ) and an @xmath44 eigenstate .",
    "hence we can find the coefficients of ( [ eigwr ] ) by solving ( [ eig1 ] , [ eig2 ] , [ eig3 ] ) for these states and inserting them into ( [ ap21 ] ) .",
    "if we arrange the coefficients from ( [ eig1 ] , [ eig2 ] , [ eig3 ] ) into a @xmath149 matrix @xmath150 according to @xmath151 this is simply done by transposing @xmath150 . here",
    "@xmath152 and analogously for the other states .",
    "in order to abbreviate the following expressions we denote the energy eigenstates by @xmath136 as in the general considerations above and number with respect to ( [ v ] ) .",
    "analogously we introduce the shorthand notation @xmath153 for the basis states ( [ trip ] ) .    in order to avoid further coefficients we choose @xmath38 to be the @xmath154-th element of ( [ trip ] ) and find the following expression for the decomposition of the initial state into energy eigenstates @xmath155 where it is has to be noted that the elements @xmath156 and the eigenstates @xmath157 depent on the quantum numbers the sums run over . hence in our case the coefficients @xmath158 and the eigenstates @xmath136 in fact have more than one index . inserting ( [ dec ] ) and ( [ eig1 ] , [ eig2 ] , [ eig3 ] ) in ( [ time ] ) and tracing out the bath degrees of freedom , we finally arrive at the reduced density matrix of the two central spins @xmath159 if we now choose @xmath160 , we have to trace out the second central spin . inserting the result into ( [ ttime ] ) then gives rise to the time evolution @xmath161 .",
