    "heavy - ion collisions at incident energies of 1 - 2 agev ( bevalac / sis energy regime ) are a unique tool to study nuclear matter at high density and temperature . according to various theoretical model calculations @xcite nuclear matter",
    "can be compressed to 2 - 3 times the normal nuclear density and heated to temperatures in the order of 100 mev in this energy regime .",
    "in addition , a fraction of 10 - 30@xmath5 of the participating nucleons is excited to short - lived resonance states , mainly @xmath6 and @xmath7 resonances , which subsequently decay via meson emission @xcite .",
    "thus the meson observables can provide information on the dynamical evolution of the resonance population in compressed and excited nuclear matter",
    ".    the production and decay of the @xmath6 resonance is responsible for the production of pions , which are the most abundantly produced secondary particles in the 1 - 2 agev energy regime @xcite .",
    "a clean signature for the excitation of a high lying resonance is the detection of @xmath0 mesons @xcite .",
    "they originate almost exclusively from the decay of the @xmath7 resonance and thus are sensitive to the abundance of this resonance @xcite . after the initial production through resonance decays , pions and @xmath0",
    "mesons strongly interact with the surrounding hot nuclear matter in the interaction region and in cold spectator matter .",
    "the interactions in hot nuclear matter are the result of a complex cyclic process of generation , absorption , and re - emission of mesons @xcite , while in cold nuclear matter absorption dominates .",
    "these processes will influence experimental observables like the meson abundance as well as the azimuthal angle distributions of mesons with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "azimuthal anisotropy in the emission of pions in symmetric as well as in asymmetric non - central heavy - ion collisions is a clearly established effect and was observed in a wide range of beam energies from 0.1 a gev to 160 a gev @xcite  @xcite .",
    "similar to the anisotropy of baryons @xcite , the effect is usually discussed in terms of directed and elliptic flow @xcite . in a fourier expansion of the azimuthal angle distribution of particles @xmath8 ) with respect to the reaction plane",
    "@xmath9 the first term ( @xmath10 ) corresponds to the directed flow , while the second term ( @xmath11 ) represents the elliptic flow @xcite . at midrapidity",
    "the directed flow @xmath12 of emitted particles vanishes for symmetry reasons and only the elliptic flow is present @xcite .    in the bevalac / sis energy regime",
    "the elliptic flow of participant baryons emerging from the collisions at midrapidity was found to be oriented perpendicular to the reaction plane ( negative elliptic flow , @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "this effect was interpreted as a dynamical squeeze - out of nuclear matter due to the build - up of pressure in the interaction zone between two colliding nuclei @xcite .",
    "similar to baryons , negative elliptic flow was observed for high transverse momentum neutral and charged pions emitted at midrapidity in 1 agev au+au collisions at sis ( gsi ) @xcite .",
    "however , the observed pion anisotropy was not been attributed to the expansion of nuclear matter , but rather to the strong final state interactions of pions with cold spectator matter transiently concentrated in the reaction plane ( `` shadowing '' ) .",
    "consequently , the chance for pion absorption is higher in the reaction plane than out - of - plane @xcite .",
    "the negative elliptic flow of high energy pions observed in the bevalac / sis energy regime indicates that they freeze - out while the spectators are still close to the participant zone @xcite . at ultrarelativistic energies the time required for spectator fragments to pass the reaction zone ( passage time ) is so short that the shadowing effect is reduced . in this case",
    "the geometry of the participant zone favors the preferential in - plane emission of pions @xcite and hence positive elliptic flow , which was observed recently at ags @xcite and sps @xcite energies . however already at sis in - plane emission of low energy pions",
    "were observed , see @xcite .",
    "hence similar scenario can hold for low energy pions even at sis energies .",
    "the elliptic flow of pions is well established and can qualitatively be described in the frame of transport model calculations @xcite , but the elliptic flow of @xmath0 mesons has not been observed before .",
    "while the absorption of pions in hot nuclear matter proceeds via the @xmath14(1232 ) resonance which decays dominantly by pion emission , only about 50@xmath5 of all n@xmath15(1535 ) resonances excited by @xmath0-meson absorption will reemit @xmath0 mesons @xcite . however , the mean free path of both mesons in cold nuclear matter is comparable @xcite .",
    "therefore , a comparison of the @xmath0- and @xmath1-elliptic flow may yield information on the propagation of these mesons , as well as on the dynamics of the parent baryon resonances .    moreover , @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons can be measured simultaneously in the same experiment via their two - photon decay channel ( branching ratios : 39.3@xmath5 and 98.8@xmath5 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively @xcite ) .",
    "below we present results of the first experimental study of azimuthal distributions of @xmath0 mesons emitted in collisions of 1.9 agev @xmath2ni+@xmath2ni and 2 agev @xmath3ca+@xmath4ca nuclei and compare them with azimuthal distributions of @xmath16 mesons in the same colliding systems .",
    "the experiments were performed at the heavy - ion synchrotron sis at gsi darmstadt . the experimental setup is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fg : setup ] . in the first experiment a 1.9 agev @xmath2ni beam with an intensity of @xmath17 particles per spill ( spill duration 8  s and repetition rate 15  s ) was incident on a @xmath2ni target ( 502 mg/@xmath18 ) . in the second experiment , a @xmath4ca target ( 320 mg/@xmath18 )",
    "was bombarded by a @xmath3ca beam with kinetic energy 2 agev and an intensity of @xmath19 particles per spill ( spill duration 10  s and repetition rate 14  s ) .",
    "photon pairs from the neutral - meson decay were detected in the two - arm photon spectrometer ( taps ) @xcite .",
    "this detector system consisted of 384 baf@xmath20 scintillators arranged in 6 blocks of 64 modules with individual charged particle veto detectors ( cpv ) in front of each module .",
    "the blocks were mounted in two towers positioned at 40@xmath21 with respect to the beam direction at the distance of 150  cm .",
    "three blocks were positioned in each tower at + 21@xmath21 , 0@xmath21 and -21@xmath21 with respect to the horizontal plane . in this setup , only neutral mesons around mid - rapidity @xmath22 were detected .",
    "the geometrical acceptance of taps for the @xmath1 and @xmath0 detection was roughly @xmath23 .",
    "an in - beam plastic scintillator ( bc-418 ) of 200 @xmath24 m thickness was used to provide a time - zero signal for the time - of - flight measurements as well as to count beam particles .",
    "the plastic forward wall ( fw ) of the kaos collaboration , see @xcite , comprising 380 plastic scintillators ( bc408 ) was positioned 520 cm downstream of the target .",
    "the modules have a thickness of 2.54 cm with sizes 4x4 @xmath25 in the center , followed by 8x8 @xmath25 and 16x16 @xmath25 elements in the outer region .",
    "four modules in the center of the wall are removed for a beam pipe made of a carbon fibre tube ( diameter 70 mm , thickness 1 mm ) .",
    "the actual measurements were performed with 320 detectors to obtain a nearly azimuthally symmetric coverage . in this arrangement",
    "the fw covered the polar angles from 0.7@xmath26 to 10.5@xmath26 .",
    "particles emitted in this angular range are predominantly projectile - like spectator nucleons , see fig .",
    "[ fg : freesco ] .",
    "the fw provided the information on emission angle , multiplicity , charge and time - of - flight of protons and light charged fragments up to z=8 , see fig .",
    "[ fg : de_dx ] .",
    "the reaction detector , comprising 40 small plastic scintillators ( ne102a ) , was positioned close to the target and covered the polar angles from 14@xmath21 to 30@xmath21 .",
    "most of the particles emitted in this angular range are participant nucleons , see fig .",
    "[ fg : freesco ] . for the selection of events according to the reaction centrality and for the estimation of the average number of projectile - like spectator nucleons the information from the reaction detector and the fw were used . the performance of these two detectors is shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : sumch2 ] , where the total charge z@xmath27 of the particles detected by the fw is plotted as a function of the charged - particle multiplicity m@xmath28 in the reaction detector , measured in coincidence with two neutral hits in different blocks of taps .",
    "events were selected according to the reaction centrality by requiring equal statistics of mesons in each bin , ranging from peripheral reactions with low multiplicity m@xmath28 to central reactions with high multiplicity m@xmath28 . the total charge z@xmath27 of particles detected by the fw allowed us to estimate the mean number of projectile - like spectators @xmath29 for each studied bin in m@xmath28 as determined by the reaction detector .",
    "we used the relation @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the mass number and charge of the projectile , respectively .",
    "the distributions of the total charge @xmath33 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : sumchar ] for both the ni+ni and ca+ca collisions .",

    "as taps allows the identification of charged particles by time - of - flight discrimination , pulse - shape discrimination and the charged - particle veto counters , we used this feature to verify our method of the reaction - plane reconstruction . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fg : baryons ] shows the mass spectrum of charged particles detected by taps for the reaction @xmath2ni+@xmath2ni at 1.9 agev . in this figure",
    "clearly separated peaks corresponding to charged pions , protons and deuterons are seen .",
    "[ fg : bar_flow ] shows the experimental azimuthal - angle distributions of identified charged baryons ( protons , deuterons and tritons ) detected in taps with respect to the reaction plane for both studied reactions .",
    "the directed flow of charged baryons in the target - like rapidity region ( the preferential emission in the reaction plane ) is clearly observed .",
