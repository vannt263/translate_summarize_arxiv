    "absorptive targets and light traps find widespread use in flux calibration , termination of residual reflections in optical systems , and establishing the zero point in reflectance spectrometry .",
    "@xcite approximating a near - ideal absorber in a finite volume presents a challenge for such applications  the absence of reflected light or how  black \" an object appears is not a unique material property or treatable as a boundary condition within the framework of electromagnetic theory  @xcite  but an object s reflectance and absorptance are intimately tied to the surface s material properties and the underlying geometry of the structure .",
    "@xcite thus to implement a low reflectance calibrator design , the absorber material s dielectric and magnetic properties need to be either known or experimentally determined in order to suitably tailor the target s geometry .    at microwave through sub - millimeter wavelengths , precision absorptive standards find use in radiometric flux calibration and low reflectance targets for remote sensing ,  @xcite astrophysics ,  @xcite and other metrology applications .",
    "@xcite elements of the design techniques used in these microwave structures can be applied to realize compact , light - weight , and low - reflectance absorbers while maintaining the overall manufacturability for far infrared use at cryogenic temperatures . in this work ,",
    "a calibration target for cryogenic applications is explored and its performance is described in detail . the design , manufacture and optical characterization of the target structure and selected coatings of potential interest are summarized in sections  [ sec : design ] , [ sec : fabrication ] , and [ sec : characterization ] respectively .",
    "low reflectance targets have been realized from individual geometric structures  @xcite or tilings  @xcite of absorbing dielectric cones or pyramids .",
    "wedges , rulings  @xcite and brewster angle light traps  @xcite have also been employed in instrumentation settings where only a single polarization state is of interest . through the microwave waveband ,",
    "the absorptive coating s finish is typically smooth compared to the freespace wavelength , @xmath7 , and the resulting reflections from surfaces making up the target s facets are largely specular . in this limit , the effective reflectance for a pyramidal wedge with vertex angle , @xmath8 , can be estimated from geometric optics considerations , @xmath9 . here the single bounce reflection at the angle of incidence , @xmath10 , is estimated from the fresnel coefficients .",
    "@xcite in effect , the geometry can be used to limit the impact of imperfect _ a priori _ knowledge of the coating properties on the final target absorptance at cryogenic temperatures .",
    "@xcite as a result , the key geometric parameters that control the reflectance in this limit are the details of the pyramid s points , grooves at the structure base , and the number of reflections within the structure .",
    "@xcite ideally these features would be perfectly sharp ; however , in practice a finite length scale is achievable and set by fabrication tolerances and the coating morphology .    in the limit where the freespace wavelength , @xmath7 , is less than twice the tiling period , @xmath11 , the target s response can be computed by treating the structure as an artificial dielectric adiabatic impedance taper .",
    "@xcite as the wavelength is further increased beyond the length scale of the taper , @xmath12 , the target s surface appears smooth and incident fields evanescently propagate into the structure .",
    "@xcite as a result , the radiation is largely specularly reflected from the structure .",
    "more generally , these arguments can be extended to treat the diffuse reflectance from the surface roughness in the design process if sufficient details are available .",
    "@xcite here the experimentally observed diffuse reflectance is taken as a property of the coating that in turn determines acceptable substrate geometry and the short wavelength limit of the structure s response .",
    "the use of an appropriate coating with a controlled and sufficient thickness to absorb the incident radiation is also an important consideration . here",
    "the material is assumed to be non - magnetic and characterized as a function of frequency by a complex dielectric function , @xmath13 , relative to the permittivity of freespace .",
    "the thickness of the target s lossy dielectric layer employed must be greater than the material s field penetration length scale , @xmath14 , to suitably attenuate signals before reflection from the underlying substrate .",
    "@xcite by design , the substrate is optically thick and the absorptance is related to the reflectance by , @xmath15 .",
    "consideration of the fresnel coefficient magnitude at the surface of the lossy dielectric reveals that a lower index coating leads to lower insertion loss per bounce and thus has greater absorptance from the overall structure in the long wavelength limit . in the infrared ,",
    "a reduction in coating thickness is desirable as long as the coating maintains structural integrity and minimal thermal gradients .    with appropriate attention to detail a variety of coatings",
    "could potentially be employed in this application  @xcite to achieve the desired response .",
    "the service temperature of epoxies , paints , and deposited films are typically limited by the material s adhesion and thermal match to the substrate material over the temperature range of interest .",
    "for high temperature applications , chemical breakdown and aging may also require more careful consideration . at cryogenic temperatures typical anodized coating ( thermal conductivity , @xmath16w / m / k ) with thickness , @xmath17 m , produces a thermal gradient across the absorber , @xmath18k / mw per unit incident flux , @xmath19 . for our application",
    "this consideration is subdominant to the @xmath20k thermometry calibration uncertainty at 4k .",
    "cooling or achieving precise knowledge of the target temperature becomes a greater concern in going from bulk to low - volume - filling - fraction metal or semiconducting foams  @xcite and semi - metallic nanotubes  @xcite in the long wavelength limit due to such coatings lower thermal conductivity .",
    "additional considerations for space qualification and other low - outgassing applications can be found in the literature .",
    "@xcite based upon prior experience for the target implementation described here we use a custom specified thickness of acktar fractal black  @xcite ( acktar fb ) amenable to a variation on the vendor s standard ( @xmath21 m thickness coating ) process for the absorptive coating .    .",
    "representative geometric ray traces are indicated with dashed lines .",
    "the minimal number of bounces occur when rays go through the focus formed by the slot s radius ( black dots , right ) . for a simple slot",
    ", the single bounce observation angle is controlled by the slot width and depth ( shaded region , upper right ) .",
    "the overall absorptance can be improved through the addition of a  dog leg \" in the slot as shown ( lower right ) .",
    ", width=3 ]",
    "in implementing the absorptive calibrator design we concentrate on the use of simple manufacturing approaches to achieve the desired response in the infrared . the underlying approach adopted was to use a lossy dielectric on a highly conductive substrate to achieve high absorptance .",
    "see figure  [ fig1_disk_crossection ] for target geometry and ray - trace summary .",
    "an aluminum alloy , 6061-t6 , is chosen as the target s substrate material .",
    "it is durable , easy to machine , and its high thermal conductance minimizes thermal gradients and enables knowledge of the device temperature .",
    "the design described is driven by a need for the target to have a total thickness @xmath22 mm .",
    "a total calibrator diameter , @xmath23 mm , was chosen for compatibility with our existing integrating sphere configuration and for use as a low - reflectance reference in a cryogenic filter wheel assembly .",
    "a pyramidal tiling of the surface is used to limit the total required thickness of the target relative to a single pyramid .",
    "the tips of the pyramids ( radius @xmath24 m ) used in the tiling were readily achievable by wire electrostatic discharge milling ( edm ) with a full apex angle , @xmath25 , and are comparable to the surface roughness features of the coatings employed .",
    "a finite width slot was substituted for the sharp groove found at the base of the pyramid in a traditional microwave target design .",
    "slots @xmath26 m in width , @xmath27 m deep , on a pitch @xmath28 m were defined by the edm wire diameter .",
    "the finite slot width relative to the pitch limits the achievable reduction in the pyramidal tiling thickness by a factor of @xmath29 .",
    "the resulting patterned features in the aluminum substrate are less than half of the component s thickness and the remainder of the substrate is used to provide low lateral thermal conduction , mounting points for cooling , and thermometry .",
    "a cross - section of the fabricated pyramidal target s pyramidal tiles are shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig1_disk_crossection ] . in the specular limit , this geometry has @xmath30 reflections for @xmath31 of rays incident on the pyramidal structure .",
    "the ratio of the slot width over the depth limits number of rays with a single bounce and sets the target reflectance in this structure . by tipping the target to @xmath32 from the normal the specular reflectance contribution from the bottom of the slot can be reduced .",
    "alternatively , a  dog leg \" at the bottom of the channel as shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig1_disk_crossection ] can be used to improve the absorptance by increasing the number of bounces ( @xmath33 ) in the slot region and effectively reduces the angular extent of the caustic arising from the slot s finite radius . if greater volume for the target is available , the influence of the finite slot width can be further reduced by using an adiabatically curved path for the slot to geometrically hide its termination from view .    the pyramidally tiled absorber structures and optical witness flats",
    "were subsequently coated with acktar fb  @xcite via physical vapor deposition ( pvd ) for spectral characterization .",
    "two coating thicknesses , @xmath34 m and @xmath35 m , were specified in order to insure sufficient coating absorption .",

    "this combination of materials finds use in targets and baffles in cryogenic applications below @xmath50 and provides an informative point of reference to the microwave structures motivating the calibrator design presented .",
    "loaded epoxy structures are typically fabricated by building up the absorber in layers via spraying , molding , or with great difficultly direct machining on a textured substrate .",
    "the achievable tolerances with these approaches have higher variability than is observed with pvd coating on an identical patterned substrate in the design s critical tip and slot regions . as a result",
    ", a significantly greater calibrator volume is required to insure identical optical performance in practice and the structure s thermal time constant and gradients are correspondingly increased .",
    "while relatively high index loaded epoxies provide a path in the microwave to minimize the coating thickness and mass , in going to the infrared , lower index lossy thin films and conversion coatings more naturally serve this purpose . realizing the desired substrate geometry",
