    "doping is the most crucial parameter to influence the critical temperature in high @xmath2 cuprates .",
    "the metallic state is reached by doping through the replacement of ions or by introduction of excess oxygen .",
    "thereby the dopant adds states at the fermi level @xmath3 , where these new charge carriers ( holes ) cause a downward shift of @xmath3 and the carrier concentration in the cuo@xmath0 plane is changed .",
    "most of the theoretical models make use of two simplifications to describe doping effects in the complex physics of these systems : first , they use the carrier concentration rather than the doping level as an input parameter , and second , they assume that the additional charge is uniformly distributed within the different sites of the same atomic species in the cuo@xmath0 plane . concerning the former point , it has been shown@xcite for hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath4 how doping influences the charge carrier distribution and what limits the amount of holes that can be created . for the latter point ,",
    "no first - principles calculations have been performed for any of the cuprates .    at the same time",
    "there is strong experimental evidence for intrinsic inhomogeneous charge distribution in high @xmath2 compounds .",
    "for example , the existence of stripes @xcite in underdoped la@xmath0cuo@xmath5 and bi based compounds is a clear manifestation of this .",
    "however , there are other sources of spatially non - uniform charge density . scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments performed on bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath6 exhibit an inhomogeneous surface carrier distribution on a length scale of 14  , in the normal as well as in the superconducting state.@xcite",
    "it was claimed that this inhomogeneity has an unknown origin but is an intrinsic property of this doped material , i.e. not related to impurities .",
    "more recently , it was found that the nanoscale electronic disorder in cuprates can be traced back to inhomogeneities on the atomic scale.@xcite local bulk probes like nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments exhibit not only changes in the hole content with doping , but also the existence of different sites of the same species as it was seen in tl based compounds @xcite and sr doped la@xmath0cuo@xmath5.@xcite    since the spatial scale of inhomogeneities is determined by the amount of dopants , for doping levels in the regime of underdoped to optimally doped , investigations on a scale of a few lattice parameters are required .",
    "considered the role of the coulomb impurities located close to the cuo@xmath0 plane on the spatial dependence of the gap in a @xmath7-wave superconductor within the @xmath8 model.@xcite in this work , we perform parameter - free calculations which allow a detailed analysis of the charge distribution . by this way the inhomogeneities can be quantitatively studied and linked to experimental findings .",
    "we investigate the doping - induced charge redistribution in hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 , which exhibits the highest @xmath2 among all single - layer cuprates .",
    "focusing on the cuo@xmath0 planes , we will show that the inhomogeneity is quite pronounced , it occurs on a scale of a few lattice constants , and is strongly doping dependent .",
    "we will also consider the consequences for the site - projected densities of states and their impact on superconductivity . to this extent ,",
    "we have performed a series of supercell calculations corresponding to oxygen concentrations of @xmath9=1/8 , 1/6 , 2/9 , and 1/4 .",
    "unit cells of the 8- , 6- , 9- , and 4-fold size compared to the undoped case are presented in fig . [ fig_supercells ] .",
    "the particular environment with respect to the dopant makes the various copper and oxygen sites within the cuo@xmath0 planes inequivalent .",
    "the coordinates of these different types of cu and o atoms are provided in table [ t_holes ] for the structures shown in the two upper rows of the figure .",
    "the @xmath10 case gives rise to an orthorhombic cell with @xmath11 single unit cell volumes , the three other structures are tetragonal .",
    "the charge of a given site calculated within the supercell approach results from the influence of all dopant ions which may be generally long - ranged . however , due to the two - dimensional character of the carriers in the high-@xmath2 cuprates , the interaction of the dopant with its surrounding is screened at an in - plane length scale which is approximately the distance between the dopant and the cuo@xmath0 plane.@xcite hence this interaction is short - ranged .",
    "therefore the sizes of the chosen supercells are big enough to study the effects of charge redistribution caused even by a single dopant ion .",
    "the fact that the doping - induced charges averaged over the respective unit cell are only very weakly sensitive to the choice of the supercell has already been pointed out in ref . .",
    "in order to get more insight into the effects on the local environment , we consider an alternative supercell for @xmath12 as given in the lowest panel of fig . [ fig_supercells ] .",
    "this structure exhibits a less homogeneous distribution of dopants .",

    "it was observed that a linear increase in the total number of holes for @xmath22 , is followed by a plateau at higher @xmath9 .",
    "the reason for this saturation was found in the fact that at @xmath23 the dopant reaches a closed shell o@xmath24 configuration .",
    "the ratio of the additional average hole contents on cu(@xmath25 ) and o(@xmath26 ) orbitals @xmath27 is approximately @xmath28 .",

    "now we focus on the charge distribution on the atomic scale . table [",
    "t_holes ] presents the number of holes @xmath17 created at the specific copper and oxygen sites in the cuo@xmath0 planes with the undoped material taken as the reference .",
    "as one can see , @xmath17 strongly depends on the atomic species , the specific site , and the doping content .",
    "concerning the doping dependence , for all given @xmath9 values lower than @xmath29 , the maximal difference in the number of doping - induced holes among non - equivalent sites of the same species ( denoted as @xmath30 ) is approximately 0.01 @xmath31 , although the distances from the ions to the next dopant may be quite different at smaller doping concentrations . for a fixed doping content",
    ", we define a measure for the inhomogeneity , @xmath30 divided by the average doping - induced charge of this species , i.e. @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "this value decreases for copper from 21% for @xmath9=0.125 to 13% for @xmath9=0.22 ( and zero for @xmath9=0.25 ) . for oxygen",
    "it is much more pronounced with values of 114% , 95% , 51% , and 14% for @xmath9=0.125 , 0.167 , 0.22 and 0.25 , respectively .",
    "summarizing these findings we conclude that the relative inhomogeneity with respect to the total amount of doping - induced holes ( i ) is more pronounced for oxygen than for copper , since doping introduces less holes on the oxygen than on the copper sites , and ( ii ) is decreasing with increasing @xmath9 .    the isotropy of the charge distribution for @xmath12 given in the table may be considered as an artifact due to the choice of the supercell .",
    "for this reason , we have performed calculations for an alternative structure , which is displayed in the lowest panel of fig . [ fig_supercells ] . for this case ,",
    "the inhomogeneity is more pronounced , with @xmath34 for copper , still being in the range of a hundredth of an electron as found for the other doping concentrations .",
    "but more important , the total energy of this structure is more than 5 mry per formula unit higher , which corresponds to a temperature of about 900k .",
    "this large energy compared to the other cell choice can be explained by the smaller distance between the nearest neighbor dopants , which , being highly negatively charged , repel each other .",
    "for the other doping concentrations , we have chosen the supercells such that the separation of dopants is maximal .",
    "the non - uniform charge distribution can also be understood in terms of the distances to the next dopant ion . focusing on the projection onto the cuo@xmath0 plane the spacings to the copper positions are @xmath35/2 , @xmath36/2 , etc .",
    "although for all @xmath9 values the maximum amount of holes at cu is created in the first coordination shell with the distance being @xmath35/2 , its value strongly depends on @xmath9 .",
    "while for @xmath9 = 0.125 and 0.167 there are only two non - equivalent copper positions differing in the distance to the dopant , there are four non - equivalent cu atoms for @xmath9 = 0.22 . in this case",
    ", the biggest amount of holes is created at cu1 , which is influenced by two dopant sites with the same distance ; cu2 exhibits the same spacing to the nearest dopant atom , but the next nearest dopant oxygen is farther away .",
    "a similar analysis can be done for the oxygen sites , where the in - plane distances to the dopant are @xmath37 , @xmath38/2 , 3@xmath16/2 , etc .",
    "for example , at @xmath9 = 0.125 , o3 ( at a distance of @xmath16/2 ) is most affected by the excess oxygen , followed by o2 , which interacts with a dopant at a distance of @xmath38/2 , and o1 where the dopant is 3@xmath37 away . also for the oxygen sites the amount of created holes very strongly depends on the oxygen concentration , when positions with the same spacing to the dopant are compared .",
    "the values for the nearest dopant range from 0.0139 for @xmath9 = 0.125 via 0.0195 for @xmath9 = 0.167 to 0.0241 for @xmath9 = 0.22 .",
    "the distribution of doping - induced charges can be probed by nuclear quadrupole and magnetic resonance .",
    "the electronic and nuclear charge densities form a non - uniform electric field within the unit cell . a nuclear quadrupole moment",
    "is coupled to the gradients of the electric field @xcite given by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the component of the local electric field , and @xmath41 is the cartesian coordinate .",
    "the traceless tensor @xmath42 can be diagonalized and written in the principal axes as @xmath18 .",
    "the isotopes @xmath43o and @xmath44cu are usually used as the probes of electric field gradients in high-@xmath2 cuprates . as a result of the interaction of their nuclear quadrupole momenta @xmath45 with the electric field gradients at the lattice sites , a resonance line at @xmath46 appears in the radio frequency wave absorption spectrum of the system . ordering the tensor elements by their absolute value , such that @xmath47 is the smallest and @xmath48 is the maximal component ,",
    "the asymmetry parameter @xmath21 is defined as ( @xmath47-@xmath49)/@xmath48 , where @xmath48 is called _ the _ electric field gradient efg . the corresponding tensor components and asymmetry parameters are given in table [ t_holes ] .",
    "some of the site symmetries give rise to non - diagonal components , which are , however , very small .",
    "therefore the principle tensor axes nearly coincide with the crystal axes and thus @xmath18 are given as the corresponding diagonal elements .",
    "recent experimental data @xcite on efgs in la@xmath50sr@xmath51cuo@xmath5 clearly show the following observations : there is ( i ) a doping - induced upward shift of the mean copper efg in the order of 10% , ( ii ) a splitting of the resonance line according to different inequivalent sites , and ( iii ) a decrease in the splitting of the resonant frequencies of two different cu sites with increasing doping .",
    "as one can conclude from table [ t_holes ] , all these findings are consistent with our results.@xcite nmr measurements on tl - based compounds @xcite exhibit changes in the cu and o efgs of the order of 10% with doping , again concomitant with our calculations . at the same time",
    ", nqr data taken on hg1202 also revealed an upward shift with doping,@xcite which is , however , too large in order to be understood in terms of oxygen - doping induced holes only .",
    "we suppose additional defects @xcite to be responsible for such a strong increase of the resonant frequencies .",
    "our results are in a good qualitative agreement with the experimental observations of ref .",
    "[ ] performed on under- and overdoped hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 crystals . in these measurements , a shift , a splitting , and a change of the in - plane @xmath43o nmr line width were revealed with the change of the doping concentration .",
    "having discussed the site - dependent properties , we turn our attention to the density of states ( dos ) , which is an integral characteristic of the system and should be crucial for the transition temperature . in fig .",
    "[ fig_dos ] , the site - projected densities of states are presented for @xmath9=0.167 and 0.22 , highlighting the contributions of selected copper and oxygen spheres . like the charge carriers , the dos s also exhibit pronounced inhomogeneities which are of similar order of magnitude .",
    "the relative differences in the dos at the fermi level from different oxygen sites are up to roughly 70 % in both cases , while these are much smaller for the copper spheres . for @xmath9=0.167 the two values",
    "are nearly the same , while the differences are somewhat bigger for @xmath9=0.22 , where the smallest and largest contribution are 0.468 ( not shown in the figure ) and 0.500 , respectively .",
    "this feature is much more pronounced when moving away from the fermi level in the range of 0.05 ev which is a typical energy scale of quasiparticles mediating the pairing . at @xmath9=0.167",
    "all contributions show broad peaks at the same energy which is slightly below the fermi level . for @xmath9=0.22",
    "the peaks have become much sharper and have moved somewhat above @xmath3 .",
    "again , all copper and oxygen contributions exhibit their maxima at the same position .",
    "although charges and densities of states demonstrate similarities , which are inhomogeneities of the same order of magnitude , there is a clear difference in their behavior when we focus on the dos in the vicinity of the fermi level .",
    "this comes from the fact that the charges are obtained by integrals of the dos over the whole valence energy range . yet",
    ", only a small energy range around @xmath3 is relevant for superconductivity .",
    "a noticeable fact in this context is that upon doping the @xmath52 band becomes less populated , which is important for the charges in the cuo@xmath0 plane .",
    "regarding the dos at @xmath3 , also the position of the saddle point ( often referred to as van hove singularity ) with respect to the fermi level plays a role .",
    "to summarize , we have performed ab - initio calculations for the oxygen doped hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath5 to consider inhomogeneity effects on the charges and densities of states .",
    "we find pronounced differences in the doping - induced number of holes at given copper and oxygen sites , where the degree of the inhomogeneity strongly depends on the doping level and the atomic species .",
    "our results are consistent with the findings of pan _",
    "_ @xcite giving a spatial scale of a few lattice parameters .",
    "furthermore , they explain the behavior of nmr and nqr lines , i.e. a shift and a splitting with doping.@xcite    besides the atomic - scale experiments discussed above , there could be further consequences of the non - uniform charge distribution on larger spatial scales",
    ". this distribution gives rise to a random potential for the carriers near the fermi level leading to their momentum relaxation . on the macroscopic scale ,",
    "these effects have been seen in the resistivity measurements@xcite and electronic raman spectroscopy.@xcite in a @xmath25 superconductor , such a potential is pair - breaking and leads to a reduction of @xmath2 .",
    "this decrease , however , turned out to be smaller than expected from the momentum relaxation rate , as it was shown in ref .",
    "[ ] . on the nanoscale , this random potential leads to the electron inhomogeneity for the low - energy states probed by the scanning tunneling spectroscopy in the superconducting state.@xcite    concerning the density of states , which is directly connected to superconductivity , we observe that the contributions of all plane copper and oxygen species are different in magnitude but peak at the same energy .",
    "going below and above @xmath3 we find more pronounced differences which makes us conclude that the importance of the inhomogeneities for superconductivity strongly depends on the energy and character of the quasiparticle mediating the cooper pairing .",
    "the efg on the plane copper atom turned out to be typically underestimated by a factor of two compared to experiments ( k. schwarz , c. ambrosch - draxl , and p. blaha , phys .",
