    "higher - dimensional black holes have been considered for a long time as purely theoretical applications motivated by higher - dimensional theories , such as string theory . however , recent developments in the scenario of large extra dimensions  @xcite have aroused new interest in such black holes . in the braneworld scenario , an interesting possibility of black hole production at a collider",
    "was pointed out @xcite ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there are other types of braneworld models proposed by randall and sundrum ( rs ) @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the geometry warped in the direction of an extra dimension is used to explain the hierarchy between the tev scale and the planck scale , and to realize four - dimensional gravity effectively on the 3-brane . also in the context of rs models",
    ", higher - dimensional black holes may play an important roll .",
    "these so - called braneworld scenarios provide new and interesting situations to investigate higher - dimensional black holes .    in the model of large extra dimensions , a physically meaningful sequence of black hole solutions",
    "will be obtained as a slight modification of the higher - dimensional kerr black hole @xcite ( or more simply the schwarzschild black hole @xcite ) if the horizon radius is sufficiently small compared to the extension of extra dimensions and the self - gravity due to periodic boundary is weak . as another sequence , there are the black string solutions .",
    "a black string is in general unstable to linear perturbations with long wavelength in the direction along the string , which is called gregory - laflamme instability  @xcite .",
    "( a stability analysis of black strings is also found in ref .",
    "therefore , a black string is unstable when the horizon radius of the black string is sufficiently small compared to the extension of the extra dimension .",
    "for such a small black hole , the former sequence is expected to be stable . for rs models , since the 3-brane has tension , it is more difficult to find black hole solutions .",
    "trivial black string solution is allowed also in these models , and it becomes unstable in the same way .",
    "there are many discussions about black holes in this model and some black hole solutions have been considered by several authors  @xcite . a strategy to construct a black hole solution is to assume an induced metric on the 3-brane as _ initial data _ , and extend it to the bulk analytically or numerically .",
    "this method generally results in a naked singularity in the bulk since there is no guarantee that the induced metric assumed as a boundary condition is compatible with a regular geometry .",
    "if we randomly specify the boundary metric on the 3-brane , almost all solutions develop a naked singularity .",
    "after all , no realistic black hole solutions which are stable and have no naked singularity have been found so far , and finding them is an interesting open question of nonlinear gravity in the braneworld .",
    "successful recovery mechanism of 4d gravity on the 3-brane @xcite suggests the existence of black holes in the rs infinite braneworld  @xcite .",
    "the shape of black holes is conjectured based on the gregory - laflamme instability  @xcite .",
    "it was argued that an unstable black string will be pinched into many black holes .",
    "in addition to black holes in the bulk , there will be a black hole that is localized on the 3-brane .",
    "we can imagine this as a black hole bound to a domain wall if the 3-brane is realized by a domain wall  @xcite .",
    "an exact solution representing a localized black hole is known in the 4d braneworld model , which we call in this paper the emparan - horowitz - myers ( ehm ) solution  @xcite .",
    "however the corresponding solution in the original 5d braneworld model has not been discovered . while the localization of a black hole was motivated by the classical instability of a black string , the anticipated dynamics of pinching off the horizon",
    "is questioned by horowitz and maeda  @xcite .",
    "recently , wiseman discovered nonuniform black strings by numerical calculation  @xcite .",
    "the obtained solutions are likely to be unstable , but they are suggestive of a missing link between the localized black hole and the black string . on the other hand , based on an extensive use of the ads / cft correspondence , there is another discussion anticipating the absence of static localized black holes  @xcite .",
    "the present paper explores the problem of black holes in the rs infinite braneworld .",
    "we consider a numerical construction of a black hole solution in this model .",
    "the method we use in this paper is based on a scheme developed by wiseman  @xcite .",
    "our method does not require any assumptions for the induced metric on the 3-brane .",
    "we solve einstein equations numerically under the boundary conditions determined by physical requirements",
    ". we will find small black hole solutions , whose horizon radius is smaller than the ads curvature radius , although large black hole solutions have not been discovered .    in the next section , we explain our method formulating the problem to be suitable for numerical calculation , and the boundary conditions are also discussed .",

    "section [ sec : discussion ] is devoted to a summary .",
    "to obtain black hole solutions in the rs infinite braneworld model , it is crucial to formulate the problem as a boundary value problem without assuming any artificial boundary conditions .",

    "the transformation @xmath17 is determined by integrating the cauchy - riemann relations .",
    "the neumann conditions for @xmath18 on the horizon boundary and on the asymptotic boundary guarantee the constancy of @xmath17 on these two boundaries . in this manner",

    "the metric functions must smoothly approach these asymptotic values . in actual numerical calculations ,",
    "these asymptotic boundary conditions are imposed at a finite , but sufficiently far region , and we must check that the solutions are insensitive to the position .    with these boundary conditions , we can solve the elliptic equations as a boundary value problem .",
    "moreover , these boundary conditions guarantee the constraint equation @xmath80 to be satisfied on all boundaries and @xmath53 to be satisfied at least on the horizon . hence as we explained , the two constraint equations are automatically satisfied as long as the elliptic equations are exactly solved .",
    "it should be noted that all elliptic equations , constraint equations , and boundary conditions can be rewritten in terms of nondimensional coordinates @xmath81 , where @xmath82 , without any dimensionful parameters",
    ". then this system of equations , and hence a black hole solution , is characterized only by a single parameter @xmath83 in our numerical calculation , we take @xmath84 and change @xmath4 to specify this parameter , since we want to fix a coordinate region where numerical calculations are performed .",
    "the variation of @xmath4 keeping @xmath85 fixed corresponds to a rescale of the length scale as we notice from the metric ( [ eq : assume ] ) , which is rewritten as @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the nondimensional part of the line element written by @xmath88 , and its metric function is given by a black hole solution @xmath54 , and @xmath34 with the parameter @xmath85 .",
    "after specifying a black hole solution by this method , one may want to transform the solutions to those in the coordinates where @xmath85 is specified by taking @xmath89 and changing @xmath90 .",
    "for this purpose , it is enough to multiply @xmath91 to a length scale in the coordinates where @xmath84 is taken .",
    "a question may arise .",
    "although we say that we use @xmath92 to specify a solution , @xmath90 does not have a clear physical meaning .",
    "one may think that it is more appropriate to specify the value of the surface gravity @xmath93 instead of @xmath90 . here",
    "we should recall the argument given at the end of the preceding subsection that @xmath94 and hence @xmath95 can not be changed arbitrarily by using the residual gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "if we change the value of @xmath96 by using this residual gauge degree of freedom , the value of @xmath97 at infinity also scales correspondingly .",
    "then , we will see that the asymptotic boundary conditions @xmath78 and @xmath79 are not satisfied after the gauge transformation .",
    "hence , for a given solution we do not have a degree of freedom to change the value of @xmath98 arbitrarily .",
    "thus , if we specify a solution by fixing both @xmath93 and @xmath4 , we are not allowed to set @xmath99 any further . on the contrary , as we wish to set @xmath99 in the actual numerical computation , we should not use the condition ( [ surface grav ] ) that specifies the value of @xmath93 directly .",
    "the formulation outlined in the previous section indeed works well to solve the einstein equations as a boundary value problem , using an iterative convergence scheme of the relaxation method .",
    "a simple check of an algorithm is to calculate a very large limit of @xmath85 for fixed @xmath90 , and compare the result with the 5d schwarzschild black hole in isotropic coordinates which is a solution in the small horizon limit @xmath100 @xmath101 taking @xmath102 @xmath103 in this limit , the tension of the brane vanishes and the background spacetime is flat .",
    "we have used this metric as an initial guess configuration with which we start the relaxation .",
    "namely , we first calculated a solution for relatively large @xmath85 , and then proceeded to smaller @xmath85 by using the result relaxed for the previous value of @xmath85 as the new initial configuration .",
    "convergences of numerical calculation become worse as @xmath85 becomes smaller , and errors of constraint equations also grow if we keep the same resolution .",
    "it becomes in general more difficult to find solutions as the nonlinear effects of differential equations grow , and we could not keep the convergence of the calculation for @xmath104 . thus in this paper",

    "black hole solutions that represent a black hole localized on the brane in the randall - sundrum infinite braneworld model have not been found with appropriate boundary conditions in the literature .",
    "we have explored this problem in this paper .",
    "we have performed the numerical calculations and found nontrivial localized black hole solutions whose horizon radii @xmath90 are small compared to the bulk curvature scale @xmath4 . more precisely , _ the small localized black hole solutions are approximately constructed by numerical calculations under appropriate boundary conditions . _ from the numerically obtained solutions , we could observe the transition of the shape of the small localized black hole in the bulk ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a4a5 ] ) .",
    "the black hole tends to flatten as its horizon radius increases .",
    "this is expected due to the nature of the ads geometry , and is also observed in the ehm solution of a localized black hole in the 4d braneworld  @xcite . although the ehm solution is the solution in lower dimensions , it is interesting to compare our solution with it in more details .",
    "although the method we have developed works well for the small localized black holes , we could not succeed in finding black hole solutions with large horizon radius .",
    "the lack of convergence in the relaxation scheme is due to the appearance of unstable modes .",
    "for example , an unstable mode that appears near the axis is a common problem in axisymmetric code ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular , the first terms in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pol - r ] ) and ( [ eq : pol - c ] ) that have the factor @xmath156 give severe contributions near the axis , and they invoke numerical instability . the same problem appeared in the calculation of a relativistic star in the braneworld model @xcite .",
    "thus improvement of the numerical scheme and formulation to avoid this instability is an important issue .",
    "it may be worth pointing out that since we do not have any uniqueness theorem in the context of the braneworld  @xcite , there is a possibility of finding a sequence of solutions other than that found in this paper if we start with a completely different initial guess .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that the boundary conditions that we have imposed do not _ a priori _ guarantee the absence of naked singularities in the bulk or on the horizon .",
    "if any solution obtained in our formulation can not avoid a naked singularity in the bulk or on the horizon , it means that there is no physically acceptable static black hole in the rs infinite braneworld .",
    "such a possibility was pointed out for large localized black holes  @xcite .    as a direction of future work",
    ", it is crucially important to find large black hole solutions if they exist  @xcite , and it needs further developments of technique and investigation .",
    "it is also interesting to apply this method to find the black holes localized on the tev brane  @xcite .",
    "the stabilities of a higher - dimensional black hole including our solution are also important .",
