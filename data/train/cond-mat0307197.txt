    "since the discovery of carbon nanotubes in 1991 by iijima  @xcite there has been significant progress in their improving synthesis  @xcite and developing technological applications  @xcite . however , the growth mechanism of carbon nanotubes remains poorly understood . indeed",
    ", continuted optimization of carbon nanotube synthesis will only be possible if the growth mechanisms are understood quantitatively .",
    "theoretical studies had been performed on the growth mechanism of carbon nanotubes on the atomic scale  @xcite , or on the role of the catalyst during the construction of nanotubes  @xcite .",
    "most of them consider the growth of singlewall nanotubes  @xcite .",
    "our approach discusses the experimental and theoretical facts relevant for the catalytic growth of multiwall nanotubes by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) , and takes them as basis for a more macroscopic , thermodynamical model .",
    "it allows considering the whole system of catalyst particle , nanotube and substrate , and calculating the growth time and growth rate in a typical cvd process .",
    "the model is inspired by earlier works  @xcite and we extend the model to take into account the geometry and thermal properties of the catalyst .",
    "we use a finite element method ( fem ) to compute the heat generation and distribution , and the carbon migration in the catalyst .",
    "it was found that the growth is mainly driven by a concentration gradient as opposed to a thermal gradient , while the process temperature plays a key role in terms of activating diffusion .",
    "considering the catalytic reactions of acetylene on iron facets one can draw conclusions on the dependence of the growth on the partial pressure .",
    "furthermore , a mechanism for the cessation of the growth is discussed .",
    "the calculations and simulations are demonstrated here exemplarily for the nanotube growth at 650@xmath0c using iron as catalyst but may easily be adapted to different conditions .",
    "this article is an attempt to understand the nanotube growth with classical methods .",
    "it is widely believed that the mechanism of the catalytic growth of carbon nanotubes is similar to the one described by kanzow et al .",
    "acetylene is thermally stable at temperatures below 800@xmath0c and can be dissociated only catalytically , in the case discussed here , on the small metal ( oxide ) particles present on the substrate ( fig .",
    "[ p - sim - heat ] ) . in a first phase",
    "the acetylene reduces the metal oxide particles to pure metal : fe@xmath1o@xmath2 + 3c@xmath1h@xmath1 @xmath3 2fe + 6c + 3h@xmath1o , whereas the iron remains on the substrate surface , the carbon diffuses into the metal and the water evaporates .",
    "the further catalytic dissociation of acetylene takes presumably place at facets of well - defined crystallographic orientation  @xcite .",
    "the resulting hydrogen h@xmath1 is removed by the gas flow while the carbon is dissolved in the catalyst .",
    "for unsaturated hydrocarbons this process is highly exothermic .",
    "when the particle is saturated with carbon , the carbon leaves the particle at another , less reactive surface of the particle .",
    "this process is endothermic .",
    "the resulting density gradient of carbon in the particle leads to diffusion of carbon through the particle . in order to avoid dangling bonds ,",
    "the carbon atoms assemble in an @xmath4 structure at a less reactive facet of the particle , ultimately leading to nanotube formation .    the simple model presented in fig .",
    "[ p - sim - heat ] describes the growth with a catalyst particle at either the top or bottom of the tube . in principle",
    "both cases work in the same way , but in the latter one the particle adheres more firmly to the substrate surface than in the former .",
    "there must be free particle facets that are exposed to the gas for the growth to proceed . in the second case the acetylene diffuses from the sides into the particle and the nanotube",
    "is constructed from the bottom up , whereas in the first case the gas diffuses from the sides and top into the particle .",
    "it was noted in  @xcite that the nanotube growth did not begin immediately after the introduction of the hydrocarbon gas in the reactor , but that some carborized spots appear before rapid nanotube growth occurs .",
    "this suggests that a certain quantity of carbon must be dissolved in the catalyst before the nanotube growth can start .",
    "in addition , time is required for the oxided catalyst to be reduced .",
    "the catalytic reaction c@xmath1h@xmath1 @xmath5 2c@xmath6 + h@xmath1 is highly exothermic . at 650@xmath0c",
    "this reaction frees an energy of about 262.8  kj / mol  @xcite .",
    "the two carbon atoms diffuse at a reactive facet into the catalyst particle and the hydrogen is taken away by the gas flow . the carbon diffuses through the particle to another less reactive facet where the carbon concentration is smaller and",
    "the temperature is lower .",
    "similar models have been suggested by other authors @xcite .    the crystalline properties and the availability of defined facets are crucial points in the growth of carbon nanotubes . in an extensive study on catalytic particles on top of carbon fibers prepared by co decomposition , audier et al .",
    "@xcite found that there are relations between the crystallographic structure of the catalyst particles and the attached nanotubes . in the case of a bcc structure of the catalyst particle ,",
    "the particle is a single crystal with a [ 100 ] axis parallel to the axis of the fiber , and the basal facets of the truncated cone , which appeared free of carbon , are ( 100 ) facets .",
    "anderson et al .",
    "@xcite determined theoretically different activities of decomposition of acetylene on iron facets",
    ". hung et al .",
    "@xcite mention that a complete decomposition of acetylene takes place at the fe(100 ) facets with fe(bcc ) , whereas molecular desorption was observed at the fe(110 ) and fe(111 ) facets .",
    "this may be due to differences in surface roughness .",
    "the crystalline character of the catalyst particles under our typical experimental conditions was proven by electron diffraction measurements and in situ real - space tem images  @xcite . at temperatures up to 1000@xmath0c the catalyst particles are solid but a high material mobility and migration was observed during in situ heating of the catalyst . it has already been shown in  @xcite that the diameter of the nanotube is determined by the size of the catalyst particle .",
    "lee et al .",
    "@xcite found experimentally that the length of the nanotubes increases linearly with time .",
    "this suggests that the growth is a steady state process .",
    "standard continuum modeling can then be used to calculate the heat flow and carbon diffusion in the catalyst .",
    "we start to calculate the carbon flow through the catalyst particle assuming a steady state .",
    "the non - steady state will be discussed later in the paper .",
    "the heat flow will be calculated with the particle flow ( carbon atoms ) :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the diffusion constant , @xmath9 the concentration , and @xmath8 is given by    @xmath10 \\qquad \\textrm{arrhenius equation}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 is the activation energy and @xmath12 the diffusion factor .",

[ p - calcgrowth ] . the calculated growth rate is shown as function of the deposition temperature in the range between 500 and 750@xmath0c and the nanotube diameter ( 5 - 35  nm in 5  nm increments ) .    in order to incorporate the effect of catalytic reactions at the surface of the catalyst particle , we start with    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the surface of nanotube generation . for the standard nanotube",
    "this is @xmath75",

    "we have then an impact rate of @xmath85 .",
    "compared with the reaction rate @xmath86 this means that the surface is always saturated .",
    "a reduction of the growth rate should then occur at pressures under @xmath87 .",
    "a sticking coefficient less than 1 will influence these results .",
    "note that , in principle , the variation of growth rate with pressure can be used to control the length of the nanotubes .",
    "we used two - dimensional finite element method ( fem ) simulations to compute the temperature distribution in the particle , the nanotube and the substrate .",
    "the carbon concentration in the catalyst particle was simulated as well .",
    "specifically for the temperature distribution we compute @xmath88 and in the stationary case @xmath89 .",
    "the boundary conditions for a constant heat flow through the facet is @xmath90 ( with the heat conductivity @xmath91 ) and for a constant temperature at the facet @xmath92 . accordingly for the distribution of the carbon concentration we compute @xmath93 and in the stationary case @xmath94 .",
    "the boundary conditions for a constant particle flow through the facet is @xmath95 ( with the diffusion constant @xmath96 ) and for a constant carbon concentration at the facet @xmath97 .    at the boundary",
    "we assume a heat penetration of @xmath98 at the horizontal and vertical facets of a model catalyst particle ( bcc(100)-like facets , see section  [ c - preconditions ] ) and constant temperature of @xmath99 at the three outer sides of the silicon substrate ( fig .",
    "[ p - sim - heat ] ) .",
    "a distribution of temperature rise is then obtained for the defined geometry .",
    "the shape of the model particle is chosen to approximate those observed in experiments ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the particle can be on top of the nanotube ( pushed up by the nanotube ) or sticking to the substrate surface ( while pushing up the nanotube ) .",
    "the silicon substrate has a length of 10  @xmath58 m and height of 5  @xmath58 m , which seems to be sufficient ( a further enlargement did not cause a change in temperature in the simulations ) .    for the heat conductivity of the nanotube",
    ", the value for graphite in the direction parallel to the graphitic layers is assumed , rather than the ( much higher ) value for perfect single - wall nanotubes ( @xmath100  @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore obtain an upper limit for the temperature rise . for iron , @xmath101",
    "is taken at the same temperature as the value for silicon and graphite ( 373.2  k ) although a value at 900  k has been reported ( for iron only ) .",
    "the particle - on - top setting is highly parameter dependent .",
    "the dependence of the maximum temperature in the particle on the nanotube length is approximately linear @xmath102 ( fig .",
    "[ p - diagram]a ) , while the dependence on nanotube radius varies as @xmath103 law : @xmath104 ( fig .",
    "[ p - diagram]b ) .",
    "the standard nanotube ( @xmath105  @xmath58 m , @xmath106  nm , @xmath107 20  nm ) reaches a temperature rise of @xmath108  k with the particle on top ( fig .",
    "[ p - sim - heat ] ) . for the standard tube 90  % of the final temperature rise",
    "is reached already after 1.65  @xmath58s .",
    "in contrast , in the particle - on - bottom configuration the temperature rise is independent of the tube geometry . in this configuration",
    "the standard setting reaches a temperature rise of @xmath109  k.    according simulation have been undertaken also for the distribution of the carbon concentration in the catalyst particle in the non - steady state mode . at the highly reactive facets we assume a flow corresponding to eq .",
    "[ eq-28 ] . on the less reactive facets",
    "a carbon concentration of 0  ppm is asssumed .",
    "it turned out that , for the standard nanotube , it takes about 100  @xmath58s to reach 90  % of the final carbon concentration at one facet .",
    "this satisfies the assumption of steady state conditions in the catalyst particle during the growth , since the time for the complete growth lies in the range of seconds .",
    "as the maximal temperature rise in the particle is very low , the diffusion of carbon through the particle can be considered to be driven solely by the concentration gradient .",
    "it is assumed that the concentration of carbon is 65  ppm(weight ) on the facets where the catalytic decomposition takes place and 0  ppm where the nanotube is assembled . the diffusion through the particle is hence determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq-22 ] ) .",
    "we have computed the growth rate of carbon nanotubes based on a new growth mechanism .",
    "we show that for realistic tube / particle geometries the expected temperature rise is negligible .",
    "thus thermal radiation is also negligible and the carbon diffusion through the particle is not thermally driven but is determined by the carbon concentration gradient .",
    "the difference between the calculated temperature rise @xmath110  k if all the produced heat is retained in the particle and the nanotube ( eq .  ( [ eq-34 ] ) ) and the simulated @xmath111  k is due to the thermal coupling to the substrate in the latter case and the high thermal conductivities of iron , graphite and silicon .",
    "the produced heat is distributed in the material very rapidly ( diffusive flux through the iron particle , the nanotube , the silicon substrate and out of the considered volume ) . in the particle - on - bottom scenario",
    "this flux is led away even more rapidly and the temperature rise is consequently smaller ( diffusion direct into silicon substrate ) .    at first glance",
    "there seems to be no reason why the nanotubes should grow in one particular direction .",
    "but the silicon surface breaks the symmetry . the diffusion and the catalytic decomposition",
    "is favored at the top facets and the catalyst particle is pushed up by the growing nanotube . only if the particle is bonded too strongly to the silicon surface the nanotube grows in upward direction while the particle remains on the surface .    under the considered conditions ,",
    "growth by surface diffusion is unlikely because it can not explain the growth of multiwall nanotubes ( growth of several walls with the same velocity , diffusion of carbon through the already created walls ) .",
    "hung et al .",
    "@xcite report that carbon diffuses into bulk iron starting at temperatures @xmath112  k ( @xmath113c ) .",
    "this means that multiwall carbon nanotubes can not be created below this temperature .",
    "the mobility of carbon in iron will increase with the temperature since the diffusion coefficient @xmath8 is highly temperature dependent .",
    "this explains why the nanotube growth is a thermal process .",
    "a certain mobility of the carbon atoms in the catalyst particle is essential for the growth . according to hung et al .",
    "@xcite c@xmath1h@xmath1 decomposes catalytically to pure c at temperatures t @xmath114 400  k ( 127@xmath0c ) .",
    "thus there is a well defined window for the growth of pure nanotubes between @xmath113c and @xmath115c . at higher temperatures polycrystalline carbon adsorbes on the nanotube surface  @xcite . in the frame of the experiments discussed in  @xcite the lowest growth temperature was 620@xmath0c . for plasma - enhanced cvd lower deposition temperatures",
    "are reported : e.g. choi et al . observed the experimental growth of nanotubes at 550@xmath0c  @xcite .",
    "the cessation of the catalytic growth may be caused by the formation of amorphous carbon on the catalyst particle .",
    "this can be generated catalytically or by condensation of decomposed hydrocarbons  @xcite .",
    "acetylene can be cracked at relative low temperatures due to the boltzmann distribution of the thermal energy of the gas .",
    "there are always some gas molecules with enough energy for the cracking .",
    "of course , the proportion increases with higher temperatures and thus finally there will be more amorphous carbon .",
    "hung et al .",
    "@xcite report a blocking of the reaction sites in case of high carbon coverage .",
    "additionally an oversupply of carbon ( more then 65  ppm(weight ) on the reaction surface ) can cause the formation of iron carbide fe@xmath2c .",
    "the diffusion of carbon through fe@xmath2c is very low ( @xmath116 at @xmath117c  @xcite ) .",
    "if fe@xmath2c is generated on the reaction surfaces , this can also stop the growth of the nanotubes .",
    "h@xmath1 in the gas flow can etch the oversupply of amorphous carbon  @xcite and extend the growth time and thus the nanotube length .",
    "indeed , this prolongation of the nanotubes was observed experimentally ( e.g. by kim et al .",
    "a reduction of pressure may help as well , but this would also slow down the growth of nanotubes .",
    "the calculations allow us to estimate the growth time and growth rate .",
    "it is questionable if continuum modeling is valid on the nanometer scale , but the calculated results correlate well with the experimental data . in table",
    "[ t - activation ] , some experimental data for the nanotube growth are listed and compared with calculated values .",
    "the calculated values for the growth rate fall quite well in the range of the experimental data of our own group , and the calculated growth time is at the lower limit of the experimental data . from other experimental groups",
    "just limited data are available , and their conditions can differ considerably from ours .",
    "thus , the growth rate could be limited by factors not considered here ( gas pressure / flow , homogeneity of temperature , catalyst preparation , etc . ) .",
    "two examples for growth rates obtained by other groups are mentioned in table  [ t - activation ] .",
    "their values are about one order of magnitute lower than our results .",
    "it has to be considered that the calculated values are for ideal standard tubes .",
    "however , the diameter of the tubes in the experiments vary usually between 5 and 50  nm and the length between 2 and 10  @xmath58 m and not all conditions of cvd processes are well known .",
    "maiti et al .",
    "@xcite evaluated a catalyst free growth model by molecular dynamics and found a growth rate of 160  nm / s at 1000  k. this is substantially lower than what we found experimentally as well as with the calculations presented here .",
    "the reason for this might lie in the importance of the catalytic growth by the according particle .",
    "the catalytic decomposition and the accompanying diffusion seem to accelerate the growth considerably .    according to our calculations",
    "the growth rate is not influenced by a varying length but just by the diameter of the nanotube as @xmath118 .",
    "baker et al .",
    "@xcite found experimentally a dependence of @xmath119 for carbon filaments .",
    "the difference between the @xmath120 dependence for filaments and the calculated dependence @xmath121 for nanotubes may lie in the fact that carbon nanotubes are hollow graphite - like structures and the carbon filaments consist of monolithic amorphous carbon , which may result in a slower growth .",
    "however , lee et al .",
    "@xcite found experimentally the same @xmath118 dependence for carbon nanotubes .",
    "they also found that the growth time is linearly proportional to the nanotube length @xmath122 .",
    "this is another hint that the growth is mainly a steady state process and thus the usage of fick s first law is justified .",
    "our model also reflects their finding that the growth rate increases superproportionally with temperature  @xcite .",
    "the discussed activation time ( time when the catalyst is already exposed to acetylene but the nanotube growth has not yet started ) was observed as well  @xcite .",
    "this period might be due to the reduction of fe@xmath1o@xmath2 to pure iron .    in order to directly compare the experimental data with the calculations the growth needs to be observed in situ to determine the growth time of one individual nanotubes and to determine at the same time the length of this tube and its diameter . for carbon filaments",
    "this has was done as early as 1972 by baker et al .",
    "but detailed studies for carbon nanotubes are still lacking because in situ growth measurements on nanotubes are difficult to perform .",
    "we have shown that the growth rate is a function of the applied partial pressure , and that effects should be evident below a pressure of about 2 @xmath123 10@xmath124 mbar . in  @xcite and  @xcite",
    "the influence of the partial pressure on the growth velocity is addressed , e.g. in  @xcite for the pressures 10@xmath125 , 10@xmath126 and 10@xmath124  mbar growth rates of 1.5 , 3.7 and 4.7  @xmath58 m/s are measured .    while our calculations are necessarily approximate , they give clear quantitative picture of the nanotube generation process .",
    "naturally , a different tube / catalyst geometry will lead to different values of @xmath69 and @xmath46 .",
    "the calculations can easily be repeated with other material parameters ( e.g. for ch@xmath127 as carbon source gas and nickel as catalyst particle ) .",
    "we performed thermodynamic modeling of the catalytic generation of carbon nanotubes which allow us to estimate the growth time and growth rate .",
    "the conclusions of the model are supported by experimental results .",
    "we find that the growth is mainly driven by carbon concentration gradients in the catalyst particle , rather than by temperature gradients .",
