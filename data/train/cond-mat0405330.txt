    "this is the third in a recent series of studies of shear - transformation - zone ( stz ) models of plastic deformation in amorphous solids . in the earlier two papers , falk , pechenik , and",
    "i showed how to use principles of symmetry and energy balance to constrain the form of stz theories at low temperatures @xcite , and then used those ideas to construct a finite - temperature theory @xcite whose predictions could be compared with the behavior of metallic glasses observed by kato et al.@xcite and lu et al.@xcite .",
    "our version of stz theory was introduced originally in @xcite .",
    "it differs from the flow - defect theories of cohen , turnbull , spaepen , argon and others @xcite primarily in that , instead of simply postulating an equation of motion for the stz density , we included a rudimentary model for the irreversible , internal dynamics of these zones .",
    "this augmented stz theory exhibits an exchange of dynamic stability between jammed and flowing states at a stress that we identify as a yield stress .",
    "our main conclusion in @xcite was that the transition between linear newtonian viscosity and nonlinear superplasticity reported in @xcite can be explained quantitatively as a transition between thermally activated creep at low stress and the onset of plastic flow at the stz yield stress .    my first purpose here is to address several issues that were left outstanding in @xcite .",
    "the most important of these were questions pertaining to the stz density . in order to retain an essential simplicity in @xcite",
    ", we found it best to leave the theory in a form in which that density approached a temperature - independent value in the limit of small but nonvanishing driving force .",
    "we pointed out that this limiting density , after indefinitely long aging , ought to relax to its thermal equilibrium value , and that we would need to incorporate such an aging mechanism into a next version of the theory .",
    "more generally , we argued that the subtle interplay between limiting behaviors at small strain rates and small temperatures provides an important clue about the fundamental nonequilibrium properties of these systems .",
    "my present hypothesis is that the stz density is governed by an effective temperature , @xmath0 , of the kind discussed , for example , in papers by ono et al .",
    "@xcite , cugliandolo et al .",
    "@xcite , sollich et al .",
    "@xcite , berthier and barrat @xcite , and lacks @xcite .",
    "some aspects of these ideas are related to work by mehta and edwards @xcite . as proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath0 differs from the ordinary thermal temperature @xmath1 in circumstances where the slowly changing configurational degrees of freedom of the system fall out of equilibrium with the heat bath  a situation that occurs when molecular rearrangements are driven by plastic deformation .",
    "my ideas have emerged in part from discussions with anael lemaitre @xcite , who has approached the concept of effective temperature from a different point of view .",
    "more specifically , i assume that , in a nonequilibrium system , the stz density is driven toward @xmath2 , where @xmath3 . in this regard ,",
    "the reduced effective temperature @xmath4 is very nearly , but not quite , the same as spaepen s reduced free volume .",
    "@xcite here , @xmath5 is a characteristic energy associated with stz formation , and @xmath6 is a density of the order of the number of molecules per unit volume .",
    "this assumption implies that the local energy ( or density ) fluctuations of the slowly varying configurational degrees of freedom are described by a boltzmann distribution with effective temperature @xmath0 .",
    "that is , i assume that persistent deformation accompanied by molecular rearrangements produces a steady state of disorder in an amorphous system . in the absence of constraints other than number and energy conservation , the statistical distribution of density fluctuations must maximize an entropy , and therefore that distribution should be described by a temperature . to be consistent with the underlying assumption that the stz s are sparsely distributed in the material , they must account for only a small fraction of the configurational degrees of freedom .",
    "thus the probability of finding stz s should be accurately proportional to a boltzmann factor , @xmath7 , and should be far out in the wings of this statistical distribution .",
    "the underlying structure of an stz theory based on the effective - temperature hypothesis is outlined in section ii . here",
    "i reintroduce the fully nonlinear stz theory @xcite in a version suitable for use at nonzero temperatures . as we pointed out in @xcite , the so - called `` quasilinear theory '' used in the preceding papers",
    "has serious shortcomings , specifically , lack of realistic memory effects and unrealistically large plastic deformation at small stresses .",
    "it also has an unattractive asymmetry between the rates of shear transformations and dilational rearrangements , which must be corrected in order to deal systematically with thermal effects .",
    "section ii concludes with a statement of the fully nonlinear equations of motion for the internal state variables . in section iii ,",
    "i present arguments in favor of the effective - temperature hypothesis and make a rough estimate of the limiting value of @xmath4 at small but nonvanishing strain rates .",
    "i then show how these arguments can be used to determine an equation of motion for @xmath4 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is devoted to exploring the predictions of these equations of motion and comparing them with the results of metallic glass experiments , primarily those of lu et al .",
    "@xcite on bulk amorphous @xmath8 .",
    "i discuss a wide range of such measurements including the steady - state stress versus strain - rate data and the stress - strain curves obtained at various strain rates and temperatures , in analogy to our presentation in @xcite . with this version of the theory ,",
    "i can go on to compute specific heat curves obtained by differential scanning calorimetry , and also can discuss the way in which those measurements may be interpreted in terms of effective temperatures .",
    "i conclude with some remarks about how shear banding instabilities may arise in theories of the kind introduced here .",
    "let us start by summarizing briefly the assumptions and definitions used in @xcite .",
    "assume that , instead of being structureless objects as in the flow - defect theories of @xcite , the stz s are two - state systems which , in the presence of a shear stress , can transform back and forth between just two different orientations .",
    "importantly , these stz s are created and annihilated during irreversible deformations of the material . as in @xcite , consider first a two - dimensional system , and subject it only to pure shear deformations .",
    "( the transformation of the two - dimensional results into a form suitable for analysis of three - dimensional experiments is discussed at the beginning of section iv .",
    "it is described in more detail in @xcite . ) in this case , we need to consider only situations in which the orientation of the principal axes of the stress and strain tensors remains fixed .",
    "that is , we do not need to consider situations in which a fully off - diagonal tensorial version of the stz theory is necessary , as in the necking calculations reported in @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to assume that the population of stz s consists simply of zones oriented along the two relevant principal axes of the stress tensor and , without loss of generality , to let the deviatoric stress @xmath9 be diagonal along the @xmath10 , @xmath11 axes .",
    "specifically , let @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "then choose the  @xmath14 \" zones to be oriented ( elongated ) along the @xmath10 axis , and the  @xmath15 \" zones along the @xmath11 axis ; and denote the population density of zones oriented in the `` @xmath14/@xmath15 '' directions by the symbol @xmath16 .    with these conventions ,",
    "the plastic strain rate is : @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is a material - specific parameter with the dimensions of volume ( or area in strictly two - dimensional models ) , which must have roughly the same order of magnitude as the volume of an stz , that is , a few cubic or square atomic spacings .",
    "the remaining factor on the right - hand side of eq.([epsdot ] ) is the net rate per unit volume at which stz s transform from `` @xmath15 '' to `` @xmath14 '' orientations . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the rates for  @xmath14 \" to `` @xmath15 '' and  @xmath15 \" to `` @xmath14 '' transitions respectively .",
    "the dimensionless stress is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is an effective shear modulus that will turn out to be an accurate approximation for the yield stress at the temperatures of interest here .",
    "@xmath23 sets a time scale for the molecular rearrangements .",
    "as we shall see , @xmath23 is not defined here in quite the same way as it was in @xcite .",
    "a basic assumption in this paper is that , in contrast to eq.(3.3 ) in @xcite , we can rewrite the master equation for the densities @xmath16 in the form : @xmath24 the first pair of terms on the right - hand side describes the same switching back and forth of the stz s that appears in eq.([epsdot ] ) , and the last terms describe the rates of creation and annihilation of zones . in writing the latter terms , i am using the principle of detailed balance to fix the ratio of the annihilation and creation factors , and accordingly am omitting the quadratic term that we used in @xcite .",
    "as before , the rate factor multiplying the annihilation and creation terms consists of the driven part @xmath25 and the spontaneous thermal part @xmath26 .",
    "our usual notation is : @xmath27 and @xmath28 then , using eq.([epsdot ] ) , and defining @xmath29 , we have @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32    the next step is to use the energy - balance argument introduced in @xcite to evaluate the quantity @xmath25 . both the effective temperature and the fully nonlinear rate factor @xmath33 will introduce features that were not present in @xcite or @xcite ; therefore it will be useful to rewrite this analysis . as in the earlier papers ,",
    "we start by writing the first law of thermodynamics in the form : @xmath34 the left - hand side of eq.([energybalance ] ) is the rate at which plastic work is done by the applied stress @xmath35 . on the right - hand side , @xmath36 is the recoverable , state - dependent , internal energy associated with the stz s .",
    "because the stz s in this formulation represent only a very small fraction of the configurational degrees of freedom , @xmath36 is not the energy ( or enthalpy ) obtained by calorimetric measurements .",
    "therefore , this picture is different from the one presented in @xcite , where we did compare @xmath36 qualitatively to calorimetric data.@xcite in either case , @xmath36 must be proportional to the density of stz s , and must have the dimensions of energy per unit volume ; therefore it is convenient to write it in the form : @xmath37    the last term on the right - hand side of eq.([energybalance ] ) , i.e. @xmath38 , is the energy dissipation rate per unit volume .",
    "the central hypothesis of @xcite is that @xmath25 is simply proportional to the rate of energy dissipation per stz .",
    "that is , @xmath39 we then can use eqs.([dotdelta ] ) and ( [ dotlambda ] ) to write eq.([energybalance ] ) in the form : @xmath40+\\lambda\\,\\gamma(\\tilde s,\\lambda , m),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be solved easily for @xmath25 or , more conveniently , for @xmath41 : @xmath42\\equiv \\tilde\\gamma(\\tilde s,\\lambda , m).\\ ] ] our equations of motion are now : @xmath43 @xmath44 and @xmath45    next we must specify the rate factors @xmath33 and @xmath26 . in @xcite , we wrote the dilational rate factor in the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a dimensionless prefactor , @xmath48 is the activation volume required for a dilational rearrangement , and @xmath49 is usually identified as the free volume .",
    "in fact , in @xcite we treated @xmath49 as a phenomenological function , not necessarily the same as the free volume , and evaluated it directly from the measured viscosities with no use of the vogel - fulcher or cohen - grest formulas.@xcite we then suggested , in analogy to the fully nonlinear stz model @xcite , that the shear rates ought to have the form @xmath50 setting the exponential prefactor equal to unity in eq.([rnonlinear ] ) defines @xmath51 to be the value of the dimensional rate @xmath19 in the limit @xmath52 . since the dominant temperature dependence of this rate should occur via the function @xmath49 in the exponent , we may expect that @xmath23 is at most a slowly varying function of @xmath1 . with the definition @xmath53",
    ", we have @xmath54\\,\\ , \\cosh\\left[\\alpha\\,\\sinh(\\tilde s)\\right];\\ ] ] and @xmath55.\\ ] ] in the applications to be considered here , there seems to be no reason to expect two different activation volumes or two different time constants for dilational and shear rearrangements ; therefore i shall assume that @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "then @xmath58 eventually , we shall need to include pressure dependence in the function @xmath59 ; but that too will be unnecessary for present purposes .",
    "the final step in deriving equations of motion for @xmath60 and @xmath61 is to choose @xmath62 so that the numerator in the expression for @xmath63 in eq.([gammatilde ] ) is non - negative for all values of @xmath64 . to do this , compute the inverse function of @xmath65 ; that is , find the function @xmath66 such that @xmath67 .",
    "then , because @xmath65 is a monotonically increasing function of its argument , the choice @xmath68 assures us that both @xmath69 and @xmath70 change sign at the same value of @xmath64 , and therefore that the product of these two factors is never negative . for the specific choice of @xmath65 given in eq.([tdef2 ] ) , @xmath71;\\ ] ] and @xmath72 @xmath73 is an as - yet undetermined constant which , as it turns out , we shall not need to evaluate .",
    "the result is @xmath74,\\ ] ] where @xmath75    positivity of @xmath63 requires that @xmath76 remain positive along all the system trajectories determined by eqs.([dotm2 ] ) and ( [ dotlambda2 ] ) in the space of variables @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this happens automatically so long as all the trajectories start at points where @xmath77 .",
    "the locus of points along which @xmath76 changes sign is a dynamical boundary for these trajectories ; the dissipation rate diverges at that boundary , and the trajectories are strongly repelled from it in a way that does not allow them to cross into unphysical regions where the dissipation rate is negative .",
    "an interesting feature of this fully nonlinear case is that the boundary always occurs when @xmath61 is slightly smaller than unity because of the weak divergence of the function @xmath66 when @xmath78 .",
    "for example , setting @xmath79 and using eq.([sigma ] ) with @xmath80 , i find that the upper limit of @xmath61 is 0.983732 .",
    "we shall see that the interesting values of @xmath81 are generally much larger than this , of order 10 or more , in which case the upper limit of @xmath61 is practically indistinguishable from unity .",
    "these equations of motion simplify greatly if we note that @xmath79 is always the only stable stationary solution of eq.([dotlambda2 ] ) , and use this relation to eliminate @xmath60 from the beginning of the analysis .",
    "( there seems to be no conventional experimental method for adjusting @xmath60 and @xmath4 independently of one another . )",
    "then we have @xmath82 @xmath83 and @xmath84 note that the effective temperature @xmath4 now appears explicitly only in the strain - rate equation , eq.([doteps3 ] ) , where it determines the density of stz s that must appear in front of the rate factor .",
    "conveniently , the as - yet undetermined energy @xmath73 disappears entirely when we assume that @xmath60 is always in equilibrium with the configurational degrees of freedom at their effective temperature .",
    "note also that this approximation will have no effect on any of the steady - state calculations presented below .",
    "equations ( [ doteps3 ] ) and ( [ dotm3 ] ) describe the same exhange of stability at a yield stress that we found in earlier papers @xcite . at low temperatures , where @xmath85 , the steady - state solutions of eq.([dotm3 ] ) are @xmath86 ( the jammed state with @xmath87 ) , and @xmath88 ( the flowing state with @xmath89 ) .",
    "the two curves cross at @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "the jammed state is dynamically stable for @xmath92 , and the flowing state is stable for @xmath93 . for values of @xmath59 appreciably larger than unity , the solution of this equation is @xmath94 ; thus the yield stress is @xmath95",
    ".    for nonzero @xmath26 , the stable branch of the steady - state solutions of eq.([dotm3 ] ) , say @xmath96 , is @xmath97 this function is shown in fig.(1 ) along with graphs of @xmath86 and @xmath88 , which are the asymptotic values of @xmath98 in the limit @xmath99 , below and above the yield stress respectively .",
    "in order that these two sets of curves not lie exactly on top of each other , i have chosen @xmath100 , which will turn out to correspond to a relatively high temperature of about @xmath101 , and have used eq.([rho - alpha ] ) to evaluate @xmath102 in eq.([mequation ] ) .",
    "we now need an equation of motion for the effective temperature @xmath4 . before writing such an equation , however , it will be useful to discuss some underlying concepts .",
    "the theory as described so far contains three distinct time scales .",
    "the first of these is @xmath23 , the roughly temperature - independent time associated with stz transitions that are driven by stresses of order the yield stress or larger .",
    "this time will turn out to be very short , of order microseconds .",
    "a second time scale is @xmath103 , which is the strongly temperature - dependent time associated with spontaneous ( i.e. stress - independent ) thermally activated molecular rearrangements . at low temperatures , @xmath104 becomes very long .",
    "the third time scale is the inverse of the strain rate , @xmath105 , which is determined by the externally imposed loading .",
    "we argued in @xcite that @xmath106 is the only relevant time scale for behavior in the regime where @xmath107 .",
    "this is the situation in which the temperature @xmath1 is so low that molecular rearrangements are not thermally activated , and the actual rearrangements , when they occur , are effectively instantaneous .",
    "thus , under steady - state conditions , the number of events in which rearrangements occur is not proportional to the time but to the strain .",
    "as already stated in the introduction , steady - state deformation with molecular rearrangements must produce a steady state of disorder in an amorphous system  a statistical distribution of density fluctuations which , in turn , ought to maximize an entropy and therefore be described by an effective temperature . therefore , after very long times , and so long as @xmath108 , the quantity @xmath4 must approach a definite value , say @xmath109 . a more mathematically precise way of saying this , which reminds us that we must be looking in the limit in which both @xmath106 and @xmath104 are very much longer than @xmath23 , is that @xmath110 if we take the limit @xmath111 _ after _ @xmath112 .    to make a rough estimate for @xmath109 , we can use the stokes - einstein fluctuation - dissipation relation in a way that will require careful discussion .",
    "an oversimplified derivation starts by noting that , because there is a yield stress @xmath113 in these models , the viscosity is @xmath114 .",
    "then , if the only relevant time scale in the model is @xmath106 , it follows that the diffusion constant @xmath115 , measured over times much longer than @xmath106 , must be proportional to @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the characteristic displacement of a molecule during an stz - like rearrangement , i.e. , roughly a molecular spacing .",
    "finally , the stokes - einstein relation says that @xmath118 , where @xmath119 .",
    "it follows that @xmath120 , independent of @xmath121 .",
    "one problem with this analysis is that the viscosity in the stokes - einstein formula is the linear response coefficient relating flow to driving force in the limit of vanishing stress and strain rate , whereas it is used here at the yield stress .",
    "a related and possibly mitigating problem is that the `` temperature '' @xmath122 that we supposedly are evaluating with the stokes - einstein formula is a very low - frequency ( essentially static ) noise strength that determines the spatial distribution of energy and density fluctuations but not the rates at which those fluctuations vary in time .",
    "the temporal rates are determined by the strain rate @xmath121 , which , in this limit , is small but much faster than the essentially negligable rearrangement rates induced by true thermal fluctuations .",
    "it helps to visualize the situation as follows . at zero @xmath1 , for small strain rates ,",
    "the graph of stress as a function of strain - rate consists simply of a horizontal line at @xmath123 .",
    "now add to this system a slow noise source with characteristic frequencies of order , say , @xmath124 , which couples only to the configurational degrees of freedom .",
    "let the strength of this noise source be determined by an effective temperature @xmath122 . at non - zero @xmath122 ,",
    "the stress versus strain - rate graph must start at the origin and rise with a slope @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the viscosity measured by averaging the stress over times longer than @xmath127 .",
    "this section of the curve at small @xmath121 will extrapolate to @xmath128 at a strain rate , say , @xmath129 . for strain rates @xmath130 , the curve returns to @xmath128 .",
    "the stokes - einstein relation pertains to the portion of this function that goes into the origin at small strain rates .",
    "thus , so long as we measure diffusion and viscosity over times longer than @xmath127 , we can estimate the diffusion constant : @xmath131 and conclude that @xmath132 as before , independent of what value of @xmath133 we chose at the beginning .",
    "we can use the above argument  not much more than a dimensional analysis  to make an order - of - magnitude estimate for @xmath122 .",
    "the tensile yield stress that we used in @xcite was 1.9 gpa , which gives us an approximate value for @xmath113 .",
    "then @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the molecular length scale @xmath117 measured in angstroms .",
    "if @xmath136 , then @xmath137 . a similar rough estimate emerges if we guess on dimensional grounds that @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the shear modulus .",
    "then , using the value of young s modulus given in @xcite , we have @xmath140 .",
    "if @xmath141 , then again we find @xmath137 .",
    "these estimates are consistent with andrea liu s suggestion @xcite that @xmath122 is the glass temperature , which also is roughly of the order of @xmath142 for these materials .    with this understanding of the role and approximate magnitude of the effective temperature",
    ", we now can deduce an equation of motion for it by returning to the principle of energy balance .",
    "as noted above , one of the main differences between this model and that discussed in @xcite is that , here , the energy stored in the stz s is only a very small fraction of the energy contained in the configurational degrees of freedom .",
    "thus we can assume that the energy dissipated by the stz s during plastic deformation simply adds to the energy of configurational disorder .",
    "it then seems reasonable to assume that , over the range of temperatures of interest here ( approximately 550 k - 700 k for the data reported in @xcite ) , the specific heat of the configurational degrees of freedom is a constant , say , @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is a dimensionless number of order unity .",
    "the associated configurational energy is @xmath145 ; and the energy - balance equation , i.e. the equation for the rate at which this energy is changing per unit time , @xmath146 , becomes the equation of motion for @xmath0 .    in accord with the discussion in the preceding paragraphs ,",
    "i propose to write this equation of motion in the form : @xmath147 the first term on the right - hand side says that the energy dissipated during plastic deformation , at rate @xmath38 per unit volume , is absorbed by the configurational degrees of freedom .",
    "the second term proportional to @xmath38 is the one that says that this process must drive the system toward a limiting state of disorder in which @xmath148 .",
    "this equation can be used only when time variations are very much slower than the microscopic rate @xmath51 , because the preceding argument for a limiting value of @xmath0 is valid only in those circumstances .",
    "thus , we can not expect this theory to be accurate for strain rates higher than about @xmath149 ; however , such rates are well above the experimental range .",
    "the term in eq.([tdot ] ) proportional to @xmath26 says that @xmath150 in the absence of external driving , and does so at a rate which becomes very small at low temperatures .",
    "@xmath151 is an equilibration coefficient , defined with a factor @xmath152 for convenience .",
    "the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath153 reflects the fact that the equilibration rate must depend on the state of disorder . in what follows",
    ", i shall assume that @xmath154 so that @xmath155 is proportional to the density of of sites at which the equilibration transitions take place .",
    "it will be simplest at first to let the equilibration parameter @xmath156 , which means that the latter sites are the same as the stz s .",
    "however , as we shall see , other possibilities are interesting .    next , convert eq.([tdot ] ) into an equation for @xmath4 by writing , as in eq.([qgamma ] ) , @xmath157 the function @xmath25 ( not @xmath158 ) is @xmath159 note that the term proportional to @xmath26 in @xmath25 disappears in an undriven system because @xmath160 in that case .",
    "we then find @xmath161 in order to avoid adding another arbitrary constant of order unity , i have used @xmath162 in evaluating the coefficient of @xmath25 in eq.([chidot ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ chidot ] ) , along with eqs.([doteps3 ] ) , ( [ dotm3 ] ) , and ( [ gamma3 ] ) , provides a complete specification of the equations of motion for this model .",
    "at this point in the development , it is necessary to rewrite the two - dimensional stz equations of motion in a form in which they can be applied directly to three - dimensional experiments , especially those reported in @xcite . to do this",
    ", i assume that the stresses and strain rates are uniform throughout the experimental samples , and follow @xcite and @xcite by assuming that i can simply replace the variables @xmath64 , @xmath121 , and @xmath61 by traceless symmetric tensors . in the case of a uniform sample with",
    "uniaxial applied stress in , say , the @xmath10 direction , and free , stressless surfaces normal to the @xmath11 and @xmath163 axes , each of these tensors is diagonal with elements proportional to @xmath164 .",
    "the total stress tensor @xmath165 has only one nonzero element , @xmath166 .",
    "define @xmath167 , so that @xmath168 ; and , similarly , @xmath169 , @xmath170 .",
    "the only way in which this analysis differs from that in @xcite is that , here , we must form tensorial generalizations of the functions @xmath171 and @xmath66 .",
    "this can be done most simply by writing @xmath172 , and @xmath173 .    with these transformations ,",
    "we recover precisely our earlier formulas , eqs.([doteps3 ] ) , ( [ dotm3 ] ) , ( [ gamma3 ] ) , and ( [ chidot ] ) as the @xmath174 components of the tensor equations .",
    "the single difference is that , because the experimental strain rate @xmath175 is not rescaled as are @xmath64 and @xmath61 , the parameter @xmath152 in eq.([doteps3 ] ) is replaced by @xmath176 .",
    "the low - temperature exchange of stability still occurs when @xmath90 where @xmath91 ; therefore , at the temperatures of interest here , we still have @xmath177 , @xmath178 . the experimental data is expressed in terms of the tensile stress , which becomes @xmath179 , where @xmath180 is the tensile yield stress .",
    "the first quantity that we must compute is the newtonian viscosity @xmath181 , that is , the linear viscosity in the limit of vanishingly small stress and strain rate . as in @xcite , comparing our theoretical @xmath181 with the experimental measurements reported in @xcite provides initial constraints on several of the parameters that appear in our equations . in the small-@xmath64 limit , we have @xmath182 , and @xmath183",
    ". then we can deduce from eqs.([tdef2 ] ) , ( [ rho - alpha ] ) and ( [ mequation ] ) that , to lowest ( linear ) order in @xmath64 , @xmath184 using eq.([dotm3 ] ) , and noting that the product @xmath185 is small of order @xmath186 , we have @xmath187 so that , using eq.([doteps3 ] ) , we find @xmath188 to evaluate @xmath4 from eq.([chidot ] ) , note from eq.([gamma3 ] ) that @xmath25 is small of order @xmath186 , so that @xmath189 in the small-@xmath64 , steady - state limit",

    "samples first were compressed at relatively small strain rates and then held at fixed total strain @xmath192 while the stress was measured as a function of time .",
    "the equation of motion that we must solve therefore is @xmath193 where @xmath194 is young s modulus . using the preceding small - stress approximations , and again assuming that @xmath4 is thermalized in these experiments ( @xmath189 )",

    "however , our present formula for the newtonian viscosity , eq.([etan ] ) , is more complicated than the one in @xcite because it now contains a temperature - dependent stz density , proportional to @xmath201 , as well as the temperature - dependent rate factor @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , it will be useful for present purposes to have a smooth functional representation of @xmath26 rather than just values at separate points .",

    "on the basis of various clues , including calorimetric analyses , i estimate that @xmath207 .",
    "this value is consistent with my guess that the temperatures used in the experiments of @xcite are all well below @xmath204 ; that is , the behaviors seen in these experiments seem characteristic of states in which the material is softening rapidly with increasing @xmath1 but is still stiff enough to resemble a solid in resisting deformation .",
    "next we must estimate @xmath208 . in the preceding dimensional analysis",
    ", we guessed that @xmath209 , which would imply that @xmath210 .",
    "this estimate , however , is uncertain by a least a factor 2 .",
    "a better strategy , i think , is to assume that the newtonian viscosity is dominated at the higher temperatures shown in @xcite , fig.10 , by the factor @xmath211 in eq.([etan ] ) .",
    "that fitting strategy yields @xmath212 , which is within the previous uncertainty and is the value that i will use here .",

    "it is simplest to start by setting @xmath156 in eq.([kdef ] ) which , as mentioned earlier , means that the thermal fluctuations that drive the effective disorder temperature toward the temperature of the heat bath occur predominantly at the stz sites .",
    "the only other adjustable parameter in steady state is @xmath228 .",
    "figure ( 4 ) shows the dimensionless stress @xmath64 as a function of the scaled strain rate @xmath229 for @xmath156 , @xmath230 , and for four different temperatures @xmath1 in the range of the metallic glass data @xcite .",
    "it should be compared with fig.(3 ) of @xcite , in which these curves lie accurately on top of one another up through the yield stress .",
    "this scaling behavior , which was discovered experimentally by kato et al .",
    "@xcite and explored in more detail by lu et al .",
    "@xcite , clearly is broken here .",
    "the trend toward lower stresses at lower temperatures can be understood as a nonlinear property of the effective temperature theory . as the strain rate increases , @xmath0 increases , and the driving force required to maintain that strain rate decreases accordingly . because @xmath197 increases rapidly with decreasing @xmath1",
    ", we may understand the curves that are plotted as functions of @xmath229 in fig.(4 ) to be a sequence in which @xmath0 increases as @xmath1 decreases .",
    "the important question is whether this non - scaling behavior is ruled out by experiment .",
    "figure ( 5 ) shows a direct comparison of the data from @xcite with theoretical curves for eight different temperatures , in analogy to fig.(5a ) in @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath231 was chosen to optimize the fit to the data at @xmath232 .",

    "remember that we evaluated @xmath26 in @xcite point by point from the viscosity data given in @xcite , and then checked that these values were the same as those that the latter authors had used in scaling their strain rates .",
    "thus we did not use the nominal values of the temperature @xmath1 in any of those analyses . here ,",
    "on the other hand , i have fit @xmath26 by an analytic expression , eqs.([rho - alpha ] ) and ( [ cgalpha ] ) , and have used this function of @xmath1 in plotting the curves shown in fig.(5 ) .",
    "the problem is that the viscosity data for the lowest four temperatures shown in fig.(2 ) does not fit onto a smooth curve . since there is no reason to believe that the material is undergoing any qualitative change in this temperature range @xcite , we must presume that either the reported temperatures or the newtonian viscosities  or both  are inaccurate . accordingly , instead of using the nominal temperatures @xmath235 , @xmath236 , and @xmath237 in drawing the theoretical curves in fig.(5 )",

    ", the low - temperature data is largely in the region where the linear newtonian behavior is becoming nonlinear superplasticity ; therefore the ability of the theory to account for the data seems significant . in short , although the effective temperature theory systematically departs from the strong scaling behavior obtained in @xcite , it appears that these departures are within the present uncertainties in the experimental data .",
    "our one remaining point of contact with the data of lu et al .",
    "@xcite is the transient response shown in their constant strain - rate experiments . as in @xcite",

    "@xmath250 is of order @xmath251 at @xmath252 ; thus the effective temperature theory produces estimates of the stz density that are in accord with the idea that this density should be small , which was not necessarily the case in @xcite . with @xmath249 , and our earlier estimate @xmath226",

    "typical stress - strain curves , analogous to those in @xcite , are shown in figs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) .",
    "as in @xcite , initial values of @xmath64 and @xmath61 are zero .",

    "turn now to the thermodynamic properties of this theory , which were missing in the earlier version @xcite but now can be explored in detail . given our assumption that the configurational energy is simply proportional to the effective temperature",
    ", we can convert the equation of motion for @xmath4 in the absence of driving , i.e. eq.([chidot ] ) with @xmath257 , into an equation for the specific heat measured in a dsc experiment .",
    "let the heating rate be @xmath258 .",
    "then ( [ chidot ] ) becomes @xmath259 the left - hand side is equal to the specific heat in units @xmath260 .",

    "the different states of the system are specified by the initial values of @xmath4 which , in temperature units ( i.e. expressed as @xmath264 ) were chosen here to be @xmath265 , @xmath266 , @xmath267 , and @xmath268 .",
    "these curves resemble those found , for example , in de hey et al .",
    "@xcite or tuinstra et al .",
    "@xcite eventually they should be compared with data for @xmath8 such as that shown in fig .",
    "( 2 ) of busch et al .",
    "@xcite ; but that analysis would best be carried out in connection with experiments like those discussed in the next paragraph . not shown in fig.(8 ) is the prediction from eq.([dchidt ] ) that , when the system is fully annealed at lower temperatures so that the initial @xmath0 is well below @xmath219 , the spike becomes very sharp and moves to temperatures above @xmath220 .",
    "the differences between the areas under specific heat curves of the kind shown in fig.(8 ) are equal to the differences between the enthalpies of systems with the corresponding initial values of @xmath4 .",
    "those values can be controlled experimentally by shearing the system at fixed bath temperatures and strain rates for long enough times that they achieve steady state . on the theoretical side",
    ", we can compute the values of @xmath4 as functions of temperature and strain rate by finding the steady - state solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ dotm3 ] ) and ( [ chidot ] ) , as we have done to obtain the steady - state stresses in figs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "thus our steady - state values of @xmath4 can be determined experimentally .",
    "precisely such measurements have been performed by de hey et al .",
    "@xcite , who interpreted their function @xmath4 as a reduced free volume instead of a reduced effective temperature .",
    "the two interpretations may be effectively equivalent for systems held at constant pressure because , under that condition , the change in volume will be proportional to the effective temperature .    figure ( 4 ) in de hey et al .",
    "@xcite shows values of @xmath4 as functions of strain rate at three different temperatures for thin ribbons of amorphous @xmath269 .",
    "without detailed information about other parameters of the kind obtained here from @xcite , we can not try to reproduce the results of @xcite theoretically .",
    "instead , i have used the parameters determined here for amorphous bulk @xmath8 to compute a graph analogous to the one in @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig.(9 ) for four different bath temperatures @xmath1 .",
    "note that @xmath4 approaches @xmath256 at low strain rates , and goes to @xmath270 at large strain rates . at intermediate rates , such as those shown in @xcite , the values of @xmath4 decrease as @xmath1 increases , consistent with the idea that the number of stz s needed to sustain a fixed strain rate decreases when thermal fluctuations assist the transitions . as anticipated in @xcite ,",
    "these curves cross each other as they move to small strain rates .",
    "figure ( 9 ) implies that this crossover might be observed experimentally in @xmath8 .",
    "all of the preceding calculations have been based on the equation of motion for @xmath4 , eq.([chidot ] ) , with the equilibration parameter @xmath271 set equal to unity .",
    "remember that the quantity @xmath272 is a characteristic formation energy for configurational fluctuations that drive the effective temperature @xmath0 toward the bath temperature @xmath1 .",
    "a value of @xmath271 smaller than unity implies that these fluctuations occur more frequently than the stz s , which seems plausible . ( the opposite situation , @xmath273 , might also occur . )",
    "figure ( 10 ) shows what happens to the steady - state stress versus strain rate curves if we choose @xmath274 . in order to be at least roughly consistent with experimental data ,",
    "that is , in order that the two terms on the right - hand side of eq.([chidot ] ) be of comparable size when @xmath4 is near @xmath109 , we must choose a much smaller value of @xmath228 than previously .",
    "specifically , @xmath275 for the graphs shown in fig.(10 ) .",
    "the most important new feature is that the curve for the lowest of the four temperatures shown here , @xmath276 no longer remains below the others as it does in fig.(4 ) , but now rises above and goes through a maximum and then a minimum before returning to approximately its previous behavior .",
    "this multi - valued property is seen more clearly if , instead , we plot the reduced effective temperature @xmath4 as a function of the stress , as shown in fig . ( 11 ) .",
    "the multi - valued behavior of @xmath4 implies a shear - banding instability .",
    "( see , for example , the analyses by olmsted et al .",
    "@xcite of shear banding in several similar situations . ) in the usual simple - shear experiment in a strip geometry , the shear stress remains constant across the sample in order to satisfy force - balance .",
    "if the externally imposed shear rate is chosen so that the stress lies in the multi - valued region , then the sample will have to break up into regions of large and small flow or , equivalently , high and low effective temperature .",
    "that is , the system will encounter a shear - banding instability and most likely will fail via shear fracture .",
    "figure ( 11 ) indicates that this instability appears only at temperatures lower than about @xmath277 , and that the onset stress increases with decreasing temperature .",
    "the figure also implies that , even at low temperatures , uniform flow should be stable at sufficiently large driving forces .    a satisfactory theory of shear banding also needs a length scale , because it must describe a smooth transition between the jammed and flowing regions of the material .",
    "the effective temperature theory suggests that a natural way to introduce this length is to add a diffusion term proportional to @xmath278 to the right hand side of eq.([chidot ] ) .",
    "the associated diffusion constant will be very much smaller than the ordinary thermal diffusion constant because configurational disorder must diffuse extremely slowly at temperatures below the glass transition",
    ". we may even be able to estimate the magnitude of this diffusion constant from the arguments presented in sec .",
    "thus , the effective temperature theory seems to be giving us a clue about how to solve the long - standing problem of identifying an intrinsic length scale for shear localization . a fully detailed development of these ideas , however , is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "my main conclusion is that the effective - temperature version of stz theory looks promising but is far from being quantitatively confirmed by comparison with experimental data .",
    "i see several directions for future investigations .",
    "first , there is a need to combine mechanical and calorimetric measurements , in the manner described by de hey et al.@xcite , in order to test predictions of the kind shown in fig.(9 ) .",
    "such experiments may come as close as is possible to actually measuring the effective temperature and learning whether it behaves as predicted .",
    "it also would be useful to repeat the mechanical experiments with enough precision to test the predicted deviations from scaling shown in figs.(4 ) or ( 10 ) .",
    "for this purpose , it might be well to use other materials such as polymeric glasses or , perhaps , colloidal suspensions in order to control the experimental conditions more precisely than seems possible with amorphous metals .",
    "a second direction for further research is to develop the theory of shear banding along the lines described above and to test the results experimentally .",
    "for example , it should be possible to predict and measure the onset of spatial instability as a function of temperature and applied stress .    in my opinion ,",
    "the principal theoretical question left unanswered is the temperature dependence of the rate factor @xmath26 .",
    "this factor has been determined empirically here from experimental measurements of the newtonian viscosity , with no theoretical justification whatsoever .",
    "the stz theory described in this paper and in @xcite differs most markedly from the earlier flow - defect theories in that we ascribe the non - arrhenius behavior of the viscosity , not to the density of defects , but to the transition rates .",
    "thus the kind of analysis that was used in deriving the cohen - grest formula @xcite seems unlikely to be applicable .",
    "instead , we must learn how to perform a truly nonequilibrium analysis of the processes by which configurational rearrangements occur , both spontaneously and as driven by imposed stresses .",
    "this is a large challenge  perhaps the same as that of understanding the fundamental nature of the glass transition itself .",
    "this research was supported primarily by u.s .",
