    "beppo_sax data .",
    "this re - analysis resulted in the finding that the phases at which the absorption line was strongest were given incorrectly in the published version of rea et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , as we noticed earlier : in particular , the line is strongest close to the pulse minimum in the 0.1 - 2kev band ( or the pulse maximum in the 6 - 10kev band ) .",
    "we nevertheless found that the reported estimate of the significance is sound and not much influenced by different choices in the background subtraction ( annular regions , circular regions far from the source or using blank field files ) or by different extraction regions for the source .",
    "the re - analysis of the _",
    "beppo_sax data made varying the extraction radius , the criterion for the background subtraction and the spectral binning factor , results in basically the same line properties , which strengthen our confidence in the robustness of the result .    using an f - test method and taking into account the six trials we made in the phase resolved spectra",
    ", we derive a confidence level for the absorption line of @xmath75 . note that even if we take into account all the possible energies at which the feature could lie in the lecs plus mecs energy range , the confidence level is still @xmath76 .",
    "however , despite being the most common method in astrophysics to derive the significance of the emission or absorption spectral features , protassov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) pointed out that the f - test may be inappropriate in these circumstances , leading sometimes to incorrect significance estimates .    following the recipe of protassov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , in order to further investigate on this significance issue , we ran a monte carlo simulation of @xmath77 spectra fixing only the continuum model ( parameters reported in rea et al .",
    "2003 ) and the same number of photons of the phase resolved spectrum which showed the line in the 2001 _ beppo_sax observation .",
    "the results of the simulation is shown in fig.[montecarlo ] : in the left panel each red circle represents one of the @xmath78 simulated spectra for which a line was detected , here we plot the depth of the lines as a function of the line energy . on the other hand , in the right panel we report the the number of spectra , among the @xmath78 simulated spectra , for which the statistical fluctuation reported the presence of a line at 8.1kev , as the function of the line depth . from this simulation we found 32 spectra with depth @xmath790.8 in @xmath77 points .",
    "we can then reliably say that the probability of the line being a fluctuation is @xmath800.32% . in summary",

    "( 2003 ) at 99.68% confidence level ( see fig.[montecarlo ] ) .",
    "note that the non homogeneous coverage of red circles over the entire spectral range mirrors the energy dependency of the _ beppo_sax spectral matrices .",
    "the interpretation of the absorption feature as a cyclotron scattering line proposed by rea et al .",
    "( 2003 ) was based on the following criteria : 1 ) a gaussian line gives a bad fit and does not reproduce the asymmetrical shape of the observed feature ; 2 ) the best fitting model is the _ xspec cyclabs _ model ; 3 ) the line strength is highly phase dependent ; 4 ) no atomic edges or absorption lines are known to lie around 8.1kev ( at least without assuming ad hoc shifts possibly due to the high gravitational redshift or to zeeman effects in such strong magnetic field ) ; 5 ) the relation between the line energy and width agrees with that of cyclotron scattering features discovered in other classes of sources ( see fig.5 in rea et al .",
    "2003 ) ; 6 ) the magnetic field inferred from the line energy , either in the case of an electron or proton cyclotron resonance , is reasonably consistent with what is expected for a normal neutron star ( @xmath81 g ) or for a magnetar ( @xmath82 g ) , both being still open possibilities . then ,",
    "if this feature is real , all the above points hint toward the cyclotron nature of the absorption feature at 8.1kev .    keeping always in mind the possibility that the absorption line in the _",
    "beppo_sax spectrum might be due to statistical fluctuations , in rea et al .",
    "( 2005a ) we discuss physical mechanisms which could be responsible for the appearance of a transient cyclotron line in this source in the context of the magnetar scenario .",
    "the long - term evolution of the source flux and the spectral hardness are shown in fig.[plot_all ] , where different observations , spanning nearly ten years , were collected . comparing the two panels",
    ", there seems to be a correlation between the photon index the source x - ray flux .",
    "the spectrum became progressively harder as the flux rose in correspondence of the two glitches and then softened as the luminosity dropped , following the glitch recovery .",
    "this is suggestive of a scenario in which the mechanism responsible for the glitches is also at the basis of the enhanced emission and of the spectral hardening .",
    "the similarity of the second glitch of with the one discovered during the bursting activity of  ( kaspi et al .",
    "2003 ) , after which a similar exponential recovery was seen , suggests that bursts likely occurred in as well , but the sparse observations did miss them , as already suggested by kaspi & gavriil ( 2003 ) .",
    "moreover , the spectral parameters and the flux changes after the recovery of the glitch strengthens this idea in comparison with what was reported for the post - bursts fading of ( woods et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "this may be interpreted as the onset of a twist , which grew , culminated in the glitches , and then decayed . a twisted external field , in fact ,",
    "is in an unstable magnetostatic equilibrium and evolves towards a pure dipole field which represents the configuration of minimal energy ( see rea et al .",
    "2005a for a detailed interpretation ) .",
    "the last chandra and swift observations show that the source is slowly increasing again its flux and hardening its emission .",
    "whether the suggested correlation with the glitching and possibly bursting activity holds , we expect the source to re - enter an active state around 20062007 .",
    "if confirmed for all the magnetars , the x - ray monitoring might be an excellent tool to foresee the activity of magnetars .",
    "based on the deep vlt ",
    "naco observation , we believe that the identification of the ir counterpart of 1rxs j170849 400910 is still an open issue , mainly due to the very crowded region in which this source is located .",
    "note that the @xmath83 variability recently reported for source b by durant & van kerkwijk  ( 2006 ) does not seem to be a conclusive word on the ir counterpart of this source , especially considering that source b has ir magnitudes much brighter than all other axps .",
    "following protassov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) we re - addressed the issue of the significance of the absorption line discovered by _",
    "we end up with a 99.68% confidence level for its existence .",
    "the fact that the source was not completely recovered by the second glitch at the time the line appeared , make the correlation between line appearance , glitching activity and flux enhancement possibly intriguing and might suggests that the conditions for line formation were met at the epoch of the _",
