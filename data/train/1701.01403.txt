    "in historical perspective , light doubtlessly is among the most classical phenomena of physics .",
    "the oldest known treatise on this subject ,  optics \" by euclid , dates back to approximately 300 b.c . yet in contemporary physics , light is one of the strongest manifestations of quantum .",
    "electromagnetic field quanta , the _ photons _ , are certainly real : they can be emitted and detected one by one , delivering discrete portions of energy and momentum , and in this sense may be viewed as particles of light . at the same time ,",
    "wave properties of light are most readily observed in diffraction and interference experiments .    before the quantum mechanical principle of _ duality _",
    "was realized , this twofold nature of light has lead to curious oscillations in its understanding by scientists and philosophers starting from antiquity .",
    "pythagoras believed light to consist of moving particles , but aristotle later compared it to ocean waves .",
    "much later sir isaac newton has revived the concept of corpuscles , which again yielded the ground to the wave theory when interference and diffraction were discovered .",
    "then the sum of evidence for each , the wave and the corpuscular nature of light , became undeniable and quantum optics emerged .",
    "so what is classical and what is non - classical light ?",
    "it appears logical to call  classical \" the phenomena that can be quantitatively described without invoking quantum mechanics , e.g. in terms of maxwell s equations .",
    "interference and diffraction are obvious examples from classical optics .",
    "somewhat less obvious examples are  photon bunching \" , hanbury brown and twiss type interference of thermal light , and a few other phenomena that occasionally raise the quantum - or - classical debate in conference halls and in the literature .    conversely , non - classical ( quantum ) are those phenomena that can _ only _ be described in quantum mechanics . it should be noted that in many cases it is _ convenient _ to describe classical light in terms of quantum optics , which , however , does not make it non - classical in the sense mentioned above .",
    "this is done in order to use the same language for classical and quantum phenomena analysis .",
    "it is worth mentioning , that nature does not make this distinction .",
    "it is our choice to employ a classical model with limited applicability as much as possible .",
    "one of the most useful quantum vs. classical distinction criteria is based on the various correlation functions of optical fields .",
    "such correlation functions are computed by averaging the observables over their joint probability distribution . for a simple example let us consider a normalized auto - correlation function of light intensity @xmath0 : @xmath1 using the cauchy - schwarz inequality , it is easy to see @xcite that @xmath2 .",
    "smaller values for this observable are impossible in classical optics , but they do occur in nature , e.g. for photon number states and for amplitude - squeezed light . therefore _ antibunching _",
    "@xcite @xmath3 can be taken as a sufficient but not necessary criterion for non - classical light .",
    "a similar argument can be made for the intensity correlation ( [ g2 ] ) as a function of spatial coordinates instead of time . in this case",
    "inequalities similar to cauchy - schwarz lead to such non - classicality criteria as bell s inequalities violation @xcite and negative conditional von neumann entropy @xcite .",
    "another criterion , likewise sufficient but not necessary , is the negativity of the phase space distribution function @xcite . in quantum mechanics",
    "such distribution functions can be introduced with limiting cases being the wigner function , mandel s @xmath4-function ( also referred to as the husimi function ) , or the glauber - sudarshan @xmath5-function .",
    "negative , complex or irregular values of these functions can also be used as indications of non - classical light @xcite .",
    "both criteria are sufficient but not necessary as can be seen by the following examples : photon number states are non - classical according to both criteria ; amplitude squeezed states are non - classical according to the first but not the second criterion ; superpositions of coherent states , so - called cat states @xcite ) coherent states , e.g. @xmath6 .",
    "] , are non - classical according to the second but not the first criterion .",
    "the qualifier  not necessary \" in the above criteria is essential . currently we know of no simple general criterion , which is sufficient _ and _ necessary .",
    "but we can make the following statement : classical states can involve either no fluctuations at all , or only statistical fluctuations . in quantum physics such states either do not exist , or they are described as mixed states .",
    "pure quantum states exhibit a so called quantum uncertainty , which is the result of the projection noise due to the measurement .",
    "some aspects of a quantum uncertainty can be described by a classical stochastic model . but",
    "such models are always limited .",
    "allowing for all possible experimental scenarios , a pure quantum state can never be described by one and the same classical stochastic model . in this sense",
    "coherent states , being pure quantum states in their own right , have to be classified as non - classical .",
    "this statement calls for a more detailed justification which is provided in the appendix in the end of this chapter .",
    "a key concept in the following discussion will be an optical mode .",
    "this concept is fundamental to electromagnetic field quantization : the spatio - temporal character of a mode is decribed by a real - valued mode function , which is a function of position and time and is normalized . in classical physics",
    "this amplitude function is multiplied by a complex number describing amplitude and phase , or alternatively two orthogonal field quadratures . in quantum optics",
    "these amplitudes are described by operators ; superpositions of the photon creation and annihilation operators , to be precise .",
    "quantum - statistical properties of single - mode light are conveniently illustrated by phase space diagrams where the optical state wigner function @xmath7 is plotted against the canonical harmonic oscillator coordinates @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we recall @xcite that for an optical mode with central frequency @xmath10 the corresponding quadrature operators are related to the photon creation and annihilation operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 as @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pq ] we show some examples of classical and non - classical light phase diagrams . here",
    "( a ) is the vacuum state , and ( b ) , ( c ) are the thermal and coherent states with the mean photon number @xmath14 , respectively ( the plots are scaled for @xmath15 ) .",
    "the diagram ( d ) represents squeezed vacuum with @xmath16 . for the squeezed vacuum states",
    "the mean photon number is uniquely related to squeezing ; our example @xmath16 requires @xmath17 db of squeezing .",
    "the diagrams ( e ) and ( f ) show the quadrature and amplitude ( or photon - number ) squeezed states , respectively , with the same squeezing factor as in ( d ) and the same mean photon number as in ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    ", for ( d ) @xmath16 .",
    "squeezing parameter for states ( d)-(f ) is 7.66 db . ]",
    "the thermal state represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pq](b ) is clearly classical .",
    "the vacuum state ( a ) and the coherent state ( c ) , which is also called displaced vacuum state , are said to be at the quantum - classical boundary .",
    "they do not violate either of the two criteria formulated above , but the boundary value @xmath18 implies that the optical field does not fluctuate , see eq.([g2 ] ) .",
    "then the poissonian statistics of photocounts , observed with a coherent field , must be attributed to stochastic character of the detection process .",
    "but if this were the case , it would not be possible to observe sub shot noise correlation of two independent detectors signals ( such as measured in two - mode squeezing experiments ) even with 100%-efficient photodetectors .",
    "therefore one is lead to a conclusion that detection of coherent light can not be fully described in the semiclassical approximation , and in this sense such light is non - classical . despite these notational difficulties coherent states as any other pure quantum state can be used as resource for optical quantum engineering , such as in quantum key distribution .",
    "wigner functions for the classical and non - classical states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pq ] are symmetric or distorted gaussian .",
    "other non - classical states may be non - gaussian , and clearly displaying wigner function negativity .",
    "such are the fock states and the already mentioned cat states , shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : pq1 ] .",
    "their wigner functions are respectively @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the @xmath21-th order laguerre polynomial .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the wigner function of a photon - number eigenstate indicates a non - zero quasi - probability for the mode to be found in a _",
    "different _ number - state , and in fact reaches the maximum for the vacuum state @xmath22 .",
    "this reminds us to be cautious with physical interpretations of quasi - probability functions such as the wigner function .",
    "coherent states such as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pq](c ) . ]",
    "the standard way of measuring and gauging the intensity fluctuations is to split the optical beam with a 50/50 beam splitter and either subtract or multiply the photocurrents of two detectors placed at each output .",
    "time dependence may be obtained by introducing a variable optical or electronic delay in one channel .",
    "this approach would identify the photon - number squeezed state shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pq](f ) as non - classical , but would not reveal the non - classical properties of the squeezed states in diagrams ( d ) and ( e ) . in fact , an ensemble of measurements on such identically prepared states ( which is often equivalent to a time - sequential measurement on one system ) would show excessive photon - number fluctuation , above the shot noise limit . to measure",
    "the quadrature squeezing one has to set up a measurement sensitive to the wigner function projection on the squeezed quadrature , rather than in the radial direction .",
    "this can be achieved in a heterodyne measurement , when a coherent local oscillator field is injected into the unused port of the beam splitter .",
    "changing the local oscillator phase one can chose the projection direction .",
    "the right choice of the phase leads to a sub shot noise measurement revealing the non - classicallity : @xmath3 .",
    "the same situation can be described in a different language , by saying that the beam splitter transforms the input ( e.g. quadrature - squeezed and coherent ) modes to output modes , both of which are photon - number squeezed , or anti - bunched .",
    "non - classical phenomena in two or more optical modes are usually associated with the term _",
    "entanglement_. a quantum optical system comprising modes labeled @xmath23 and @xmath24 is said to be entangled if its wave function does not factorize : @xmath25 .",
    "this concept can be applied to systems of more than two modes , in which case one has multipartite entanglement .",
    "entangled states can also be described in density operators notation , which allows to consider the states that are not quantum - mechanically pure .",
    "perhaps the most common examples of entangled states in optics are so - called bell states of a polarization - entangled photon pair and @xmath24 one of the two spatial modes .",
    "hence we work in four - dimensional hilbert space where single - photon base states can be mapped as follows : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 . ]",
    "@xmath30 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 designate spatial modes .",
    "it is also possible to have a photon pair simultaneously entangled in _ both _ polarization and frequency ( or equivalently , time ) @xcite .",
    "not only a single pair of photons may be entangled .",
    "it is also possible to create an entangled state with larger certain or uncertain photon numbers .",
    "one of the examples is vacuum entangled with a fock state @xmath31 , dubbed  noon - state \" @xcite .",
    "macroscopical states can be entangled not only in photon numbers , but also in the canonical coordinates ( quadratures ) @xmath8 and @xmath9 . to distinguish it from the entanglement in the discrete photon numbers , quadrature entanglement",
    "is also called continuous - variable entanglement .",
    "it can be generated e.g. by combining two squeezed vacuum states on a beam splitter @xcite , and forms a foundation for continuous - variable quantum information processing @xcite and quantum state teleportation @xcite .",
    "the discrete and continuous variable descriptions correspond to expanding the wave function in two different bases .",
    "one and the same state can be represented by either one of them . on the practical side : photon number resolving detectors measure in terms of the discrete fock state basis and homodyne detection measures in terms of quadrature basis .",
    "graphic representation of two- or multi - mode non - classical states on a phase diagram is more complicated than for a single mode . in general",
    ", it requires as many diagrams as there are modes , with a color coding indicating the quantum - correlated sub - spaces _ within _ each diagram @xcite .",
    "this appears to allow for a better photon localization in phase space than is permitted by heisenberg uncertainty .",
    "however the uncertainty principle in not really violated , because the localization occurs in superpositions of quadratures of different field operators that do commute , e.g. @xmath32=0 $ ] , giving rise to einstein - podolski - rosen correlations .",
    "the quantum state of any one mode of a system comprising many modes and described by a multi - partite state can be found by taking a trace over the unobserved modes .",
    "if initially the entire system was in a pure entangled state , the single mode sub - system will be found in a mixed state , as can e.g. be seen starting from equations ( [ bellstates ] ) and ( [ freqent ] ) .",
    "this also can be understood following a von neumann entropy analysis @xcite .",
    "indeed , if a bipartite system is in a pure state with @xmath33 , and the conditional entropy is negative @xmath34 because of entanglement , then the entropy of a sub - system is positive , @xmath35 , which means that it is in a mixed state .",
    "remarkably , in some cases this does not preclude this mode from being in a non - classical state .",
    "for example , the twin beams of an optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) that are well - known to be quantum - correlated ( or two - mode squeezed ) , are predicted @xcite and demonstrated @xcite to be also single - mode squeezed when the opo is well above the threshold . in this case one finds a mixed squeezed state which occupies a larger area in phase space than required by the uncertainty relation .",
    "it should be noted that two - mode quantum correlation and single spatial mode non - classical photon statistics are often viewed as two sides of the same coin .",
    "this affinity , emphasized by the use of the term  two - mode squeezing \" in analogy with the  two - mode entanglement \" , arises from the simplicity of conversion between these types of photon statistics .",
    "the conversion is performed with a linear beamsplitter , and can be elegantly described @xcite by an su(2 ) operator converting two input states to two output states .",
    "this operation leads to a conversion of phase fluctuations into amplitude fluctuations , and of two - mode entanglement into single - mode squeezing @xcite .    a special case of two - mode squeezing is realized when the modes are associated with orthogonal polarizations of the same optical beam .",
    "just like a spatial mode can be associated with any function from an orthogonal set of helmholtz equation solutions ( e.g. laguerre - gauss modes ) , here we are free to chose any polarization basis to designate polarization modes .",
    "it is often convenient to chose a linear basis @xmath36 . in this case polarization",
    "stokes operators are introduced as @xmath37 like the canonical coordinate or quadrature operators ( [ pq ] ) , stokes operators do not commute .",
    "they too span a phase space ( three - dimensional instead of two - dimensional , since we now have two independent polarization modes ) where a pure state occupies the minimum volume allowed by the uncertainty relations .",
    "its shape , however , can be distorted - squeezed .",
    "for example , squeezing in the @xmath38 quadrature can be observed as sub shot noise fluctuations of the difference of the currents generated by two photo detectors set to measure optical powers in the @xmath39 and @xmath40 linear polarizations .    with increasing the number of modes , which in optics may be associated with the hilbert space dimension",
    ", the list of possible non - classical states rapidly grows .",
    "some examples are the entangled states of multiple photons in different modes , such as optical ghz states @xcite , w states @xcite , as well as cluster @xcite and graph @xcite states , smolin states @xcite and others .    in quantum communications ,",
    "higher - dimensional entanglement provides a higher information capacity @xcite . from a fundamental point of view",
    ", higher - dimensional entanglement leads to stronger violations of generalized bell s inequalities @xcite .",
    "this has been experimentally demonstrated in a 16-dimentional hilbert space spanned by the optical polarization states @xcite and in a 12-dimensional hilbert space spanned by the optical orbital angular momentum ( oam ) states @xcite .",
    "entanglement in the hilbert space spanned by oam states @xcite is a relatively novel and very promising approach to generating multi - mode entanglement .",
    "two - photon entanglement in 100@xmath41100 - dimensional space was demonstrated following this approach @xcite , as was the _ four - photon _",
    "entanglement @xcite .",
    "entanglement of a 100 , and with certain allowances of even a 1000 optical modes based on polarization , rather than spacial , variables has also been theoretically discussed @xcite and shown to be within reach with the existing technology . however applying the entanglement metrics @xcite such as negativity @xcite or concurrence",
    "@xcite shows that such states are very close to classical light .",
    "let us now review some of the practical applications that make non - classical light such an important topic in optics .",

    "the concept underlying this method is very simple .",
    "suppose a process generating photon pairs , such as spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) , produces @xmath21 signal and idler photon pairs per second .",

    "therefore both quantum efficiencies can be inferred by counting the individual and coincidence detections : @xmath49 . in practical applications",
    "one needs to account for multiple pairs occasionally generated in spdc during a coincidence window , dark noise and dead time of the detectors , and other factors that make the calibration formula and procedure more complicated @xcite .",

    ", a correlation function of two photo currents is used instead of the coincidence counting rate @xcite . note that since the discrete character of photo detections is no longer required , this method allows for using the two - mode squeezed light instead of two - photon spdc light @xcite .",
    "a multimode version of this method was used for calibration of ccd cameras @xcite .    similarly to spontaneous emission by excited atoms , spdc can be viewed as amplification of vacuum unsertainty of the optical field .",
    "this vacuum uncertainty is often referred to as _ vacuum fluctuations_. but strictly speaking this is a time independent uncertainty which is stochastically projected on a single value when measured . when repeating the process of state preparation and measurement many times , the uncertainty is transformed into an apparent fluctuation .",

    "coupling the system under study to some environment which then looses coherence ( i.e. which decoheres ) has the same effect .",

    "frequency - doubled 1064 nm laser light pumped a degenerate opo system consisting of a lithium niobate crystal inside a fabri - perot resonator .",
    "the same fundamental laser light was used as a local oscillator in homodyne detection of the squeezed vacuum .",
    "3.5 db of squeezing was measured . in 1992 this result",
    "was slightly improved to 3.8 db with a bow - tie cavity @xcite .",
    "this configuration was further improved by using periodically poled ktp crystals , which reduced the linear and pump - induced absorption and eliminated the transverse walk - off .",
    "7.2 db of squeezing was demonstrated in 2006 @xcite , and 9 db in 2007 @xcite .",
    "thorough stabilzation of a cavity allowed generation of a narrow - band , 5 db squeezed vacuum matching the rubidium d1 line @xcite . using a monolithic cavity boosted the squeezing to 10 db in 2008 @xcite and to 12.7 db in 2010 @xcite .",
    "most recently , a new record , 15 db of squeezing , was reported @xcite .",
    "the experiments @xcite were carried out below the opo threshold .",
    "this means that the mean photon number per mode was below unity , or in other words , the process was predominantly vacuum - seeded , in contrast to the case of self - sustained oscillations . in this sense",
    "a sub - threshold opo can be compared to a very long crystal in an spdc experiment . by contrast , operating an opo _ above _ the threshold turns it into a laser .",
    "this is not an ordinary classical laser , however .",
    "a non - degenerate opo laser emits two beams that are quantum - correlated , or two - mode squeezed .",
    "this has been demonstrated already in 1987 by heidmann _",
    "et al . _ , who used a type - ii opo to generate a few milliwatts in each near - degenerate signal and idler beams @xcite .",
    "in a few years the same approach yielded 8.5 db of two - mode squeezing @xcite , which had remained a squeezing world record perhaps for the longest time .",
    "the photon number correlation between the signal and idler beams can be used to prepare sub - poissonian light in either one of these beams .",
    "this was demonstrated in 1988 by tapster et al .",
    "@xcite who detected the fluctuations of the signal beam power emitted in a type - i spdc process from a kdp crystal in frequency - degenerate but non - collinear configuration , and fed them back to the pump power thereby achieving the photon - number squeezing in the idler beam . a variation of this experiment",
    "was performed later with a sub - threshold opo@xcite , in which case the signal measurement was _ fed forward _ to a fast intensity modulator placed in the idler beam . in @xcite one can also find an extensive theoretical analysis of both feedforward and feedback techniques applied for preparing sub - poissonian light in pdc . in section [ sec : lasers ] we will see how both these techniques can be applied to other types of lasers to generate non - classical light .",
    "this approach received an interesting developement in 2003 @xcite , when instead of actively using the signal power fluctuations in a feedback or feedforward loops , laurat _ et al .",
    "_ used them for conditioning the signal - idler squeezing measurement .",
    "only those measurements were retained when the fluctuations were below a certain threshold .",
    "thereby a continuous - variables post - selective measurement was implemented , which allowed to observe 7.5 db of squeezing .",
    "discussing the quantum information applications of non - classical light , we have mentioned the importance of making the source narrow - band enough to match the optical transitions widths in gas phase ensemble quantum memories , often implemented with atoms or ions .",
    "an opo provides such an opportunity . above the threshold",
    ", its line can be considerably narrower than the cold cavity linewidth due to the schawlow - townes effect .",
    "thus even with modest cavities opo light can match the narrow atomic transitions .",
    "_ used this approach to observe spin squeezing of cold atomic ensemble induced by interaction with squeezed vacuum @xcite .",
    "later it was shown that such a spin - squeezed atomic state can regenerate the squeezed vacuum , thereby verifying its storage @xcite .",
    "it is more difficult to achieve narrow - line opo operation below the threshold .",
    "usually it requires external high-@xmath4 filter cavities @xcite or post - selection @xcite techniques that considerably reduce the signal rate , as well as introduce inevitable losses at the edges of the filter windows .",
    "it would be desirable to generate photon pairs directly into a single or a few easily separated modes .",
    "this became possible by using wgm micro - resonators .    in wgm resonators light",
    "is guided along a smooth optical surface of rotation by continuous total internal reflection , similarly to how sound is guided in their namesake acoustical analogues .",
    "wgm resonators defy the postulate of light propagating in a straight line in the most profound way : here the light ray bends at every point .",
    "the wgm eigenfunctions inside of a spherical resonator are @xmath114 where @xmath115 are usual spherical coordinates , @xmath116 is the spherical bessel function of order @xmath117 , @xmath118 are the associated legendre polynomials , and @xmath119 is the amplitude .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath120 for a given radial mode number @xmath121 is found by matching the internal bessel and external hankel eigenfunctions according to the boundary condition at the resonator rim @xmath122 .",
    "for relatively large wgm resonators with small evanescent field the approximation @xmath123 yields quite accurate results .",
    "it is convenient to introduce @xmath124 which gives the mode order in the @xmath125 direction , similarly to how @xmath9 gives it in the radial direction .",
    "intensity distributions in the fundamental and three higher - order wgms are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wgmr](a)-(d ) .",

    "optical beams , visible inside the prism because of fluorescence , are focused at the coupling region where the total internal reflection is locally frustrated . ]",
    "more detailed discussion of wgm resonators and their properties can be found in review papers @xcite .",
    "here we only make two comments regarding wgm resonators that are relevant to our topic .",
    "first , the quality factor @xmath4 of wgm resonators made from optically nonlinear crystals typically ranges from 10 to 100 millions . for a resonator with 1 mm circumference and 1 @xmath77 m wavelength",
    "this translates to the finesse @xmath131 . limited by absorption of the material , high @xmath4 persists within its entire transparency window , which for a good optical crystal may well exceed an octave",
    ". therefore the pump , signal and idler are all high - finesse modes , which increases the nonlinear optical conversion efficiency by a factor of @xmath132 compared to the same millimeter - long crystal without a cavity .",
    "this is a very strong enhancement which allows to seriously discuss the perspectives of doing nonlinear and quantum optics with a few or even single photons , in particular implementing optical quantum logic gates @xcite .",
    "the second note concerns the spdc phase matching .",
    "while the formalism ( [ uparam ] ) , ( [ omega ] ) , ( [ ovlp ] ) still applies , the overlap integral ( [ ovlp ] ) leads to selection rules that are much less restrictive than the usual phase matching ( [ pmk ] ) .",
    "in fact the angular part of this integral yields the clebsch - gordan coefficients , reminding us that in spherical geometry the orbital momenta are conserved , rather than linear momenta . the radial part leads to no strict selection rules , but it favors such combinations when @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "spdc was observed in wgm resonators made from various optically nonlinear crystals and at various pump wavelengths both above @xcite and below@xcite the opo threshold which for such resonators can be as low as several microwatts @xcite .",
    "two - mode squeezing above the threshold was reported by frst _",
    "the emitted signal and idler wavelengths can be tuned in a very wide range but at the same time with a great precision using a combination of temperature tuning , pump mode selection and evanescent field manipulation . adjusting these parameters , schunk _ et al .",
    "_ have been able to tune the signal wavelength to an atomic transition and observe fluorescence induced by single heralded photons @xcite . in this experiment",
    "both cesium and rubidium d1 transitions were accessed using the same laser and the same resonator with the resonator temperature change by less than 2@xmath134c .",
    "narrow linewidth of wgms leads to a relatively sparse spectrum .",
    "leveraging the selection rules , this can be used for engineering a single - mode parametric light source . strictly single mode operation attested to by a glauber correlation function measurement on the signal beam @xmath135",
    "was demonstrated by frtsch _",
    "et al . _ with only minimal spectral filtering @xcite . in this experiment",
    "the spectral width of the pulsed pump was transform - limited to approximately 20 mhz , exceeding the signal and idler spectral widths ( both equal to the resonator linewidth ) by more than a factor of two .",
    "hence even a very careful measurement of the signal frequency would not allow to identify its idler twin photon among the others using relation ( [ pmom ] ) , and true single - mode regime is achieved .    by the same argument",
    ", single - mode operation should not be expected with a cw pump having a linewidth smaller than that of a resonator mode .",
    "however an experiment using sub - khz wide cw laser pumping a wmg resonator with several mhz linewidth @xcite showed surprisingly few ( approximately three , where it should be thousands ) spdc modes , consistently with @xmath136 .",
    "note that in this experiment the ",
    "parasitic \" spdc into a wrong family of signal and idler wgms has not been filtered out .",
    "such filtering has improved @xmath137 from 1.5 to 2 in the pulsed light experiment @xcite , see above . therefore the extra modes observed in @xcite are more likely to be associated with different mode families than with photons distinguishability within a single wgm .",
    "the apparent paradox is resolved if we contemplate the fact that limitation of the observation time prevents us , even in principle , from performing a frequency measurement of the signal photon with the resolution required to localize the idler photon within a wgm linewidth . in this respect , gating a photon - detection measurement is equivalent to pulsing the pump . in both experiments @xcite and @xcite the measurement time was defined by the resolution of the instrument recording the signal - idler coincidences , 1 ns and 162 ps respectively , much too short for resolving the wgm linewidth .    closing this section",
    "we would like to make two remarks regarding the cavity - assisted nonlinear optical processes .",
    "the first one is that squeezing can be attained not only in pdc but also in other such processes .",
    "for example , both the second harmonic @xcite and fundamental pump wavelength @xcite in the frequency - doubling processes may be squeezed .",
    "but in such processes the amount of squeezing is inherently limited and most likely does not present significant practical interest .",
    "the second remark is that the parametric down - conversion near degeneracy may populate multiple pairs of quantum - correlated signal and idler modes @xcite , leading to an optical comb .",
    "such quantum - correlated optical combs may be used for creating multipartite entangled states , highly desired in many quantum information applications , e.g. in linear quantum computing .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that wgm is not the only type of the optically nonlinear monolithic resonators based on total internal reflection .",
    "opo based on square - shaped monolithic resonators has been recently implemented to generate 2.6 db of vacuum squeezing @xcite .          a monochromatic wave propagating in kerr media experiences self - phase modulation ( spm ) that can be described by the kerr hamiltonian @xmath138 and by the associated time evolution operator @xcite .",
    "if the nonlinear phase shift is small enough this interaction can be approximated by a dependence of the index of refraction @xmath139 on the intensity @xmath140 @xcite : @xmath141 relation ( [ n2 ] ) is applicable to classical and quantum fluctuations of intensity .",
    "expanding e.g. a coherent state in the photon - number basis we observe that the spm advances a higher - number state @xmath142 further in the phase space than a lower - number state @xmath143 . as a result ,",
    "a characteristic shearing of the wigner function occurs , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : kerr ] , eventually leading to a crescent shape similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : pq](f ) and indicating the number - phase squeezing @xcite .",
    "the direction of shearing is opposite for materials with self - focusing ( @xmath144 ) and self - defocusing ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "note that spm broadens the optical spectrum , leading to generation of frequency - shifted fields , but preserves the initial field energy .",
    "this process can be also described as degenerate four - wave mixing ; in continuous - spectrum systems there is no clear boundary between these two processes .",
    "broad - band kerr response in transparent dielectrics is much weaker than the resonant kerr response in atoms , or the quadratic response in optical crystals .",
    "however , the kerr nonlinearity in dielectrics has an important advantage : it is present also in amorphous materials such as fused silica , that can be shaped into long single - mode fibers with very low loss .",
    "this advantage allowed shelby _",
    "@xcite to observe kerr squeezing in fiber already in 1986 , the same year as the first opo squeezing was reported and a year after the first demonstration of squeezing in a sodium beam .",
    "they used 114 m of liquid helium cooled single - mode optical fiber pumped with cw 647 nm laser light . reflecting the output light off a single - ended cavity they varied the phase between the pump ( also serving as the local oscillator ) and the squeezed sideband to observe 0.6 db of squeezing .",
    "liquid helium had to be used to suppress stimulated brillouin oscillations and spontaneous guided acoustic - wave brillouin scattering ( gawbs ) , the acousto - optic phenomena presenting the main obstacles to cw kerr - squeezing in fibers .",
    "these obstacles can be circumvented by using short pulses and high peak intensities .",
    "because of different power dependence of the kerr and brillouin responses this effectively minimizes the latter .",
    "bergman and haus observed 5 db of squeezing with 100-ps pulses proagating in a 50 m fiber loop sagnac interferometer @xcite . alleviating the problem with gawbs , short pulses bring about a difficulty of their own : gvd causes them to spread , losing the advantage of high peak power .",
    "this problem can be solved using optical solitons .",
    "rosenbluh and shelby have detected a modest ( 1.1 db ) squeezing of 200-fs soliton pulses propagating at room temperature in 5 m of optical fiber symmetric sagnac interferometer @xcite .",
    "asymmetric sagnac interferometers were later used to produce stronger amplitude squeezing of solitons : 3.9 db ( 6.0 db corrected for losses ) with 126-fs pulses @xcite , and 5.7 db ( 6.2 db corrected for losses ) with 182-fs pulses @xcite .",
    "sagnac loops are convenient because they naturally facilitate a homodyne measurement . however , detecting the photon - number squeezing in a direct measurement is also possible .",
    "this was accomplished in a unidirectionally pumped 1.5 km fiber , yielding 2.3 db ( 3.7 db corrected for losses ) squeezing of 2.3-ps soliton pulses @xcite . in combination with",
    "the propagation length dependent spectral filtering , this technique has lead to even stronger ( 3.8 db ) squeezing of 130-fs pulses @xcite . squeezing bandwidth in this experiment",
    "is shown to be at least 2 ghz .",
    "even higher bandwidths are theoretically possible .",
    "research aiming at ultra high bandwidth squeezing of individual multi - thz pulses is currently in progress @xcite .",
    "the benefit of squeezing solitons does not come entirely for free : solitonic propagation requires specific input pulse shape and area , which makes the squeezing depend on the pulse energy @xcite . but",
    "stabilizing the pulse energy is a much more tractable problem than suppressing gawbs and managing gvd . and",
    "in addition , if the input energy is large enough for the given pulse parameters , the nonlinear dynamical evolution of the the pulse will lead to a soliton solution .",
    "polarization squeezing can be prepared from quadrature squeezing of two orthogonaly polarized modes by projecting them onto a new polarization basis .",
    "used for this purpose polarization - maintaining ( pm ) optical fibers in sagnac configuration , producing about 1 db of squeezing @xcite .",
    "better results were obtained with a unidirectionally pumped 13.3 m pm fiber @xcite , in which case 130-fs soliton pulses were squeezed to 5.1 db .",
    "this result was later improved to 6.8 db ( 10.4 db corrected for losses ) , but raman scattering was found to become a limiting factor at that level @xcite .",
    "an interesting approach was taken by margalit _",
    "@xcite , who used _ off - diagonal _ components of the @xmath146 tensor to cross - phase modulate orthogonal polarizations . in this case",
    "linearly polarized 1-nj 150-fs pulses propagating unidirectionally in a non - pm fiber induced 3 db of vacuum squeezing in the orthogonal polarization .",
    "invention of microstructured , hollow - core and photonic crystal fibers opened new opportunities in kerr squeezing . in microstructured fibers ,",
    "light is confined primarily in a thin solid core which concentrates the optical field in a smaller volume and increases the kerr interaction strength .",
    "furthermore , gvd in such fibers can be engineered by designing the structure around the core . pumping a microstructured fiber near its zero gvd with 38-fs pulses , hirosawa _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite observed a spectrally broadened optical signal with up to 4.6 db ( 10.3 db corrected for losses ) squeezing for some sidebands .",
    "_ @xcite observed 3.9 db of squeezing and a reduction of excess noise , i.e. an increase in purity , as compared to standard fiber squeezing experiments .",
    "four wave mixing in microstructured fibers has been also used to create pulsed photon pairs at a rate rivaling the best spdc souces @xcite .",
    "another opportunity lies in combining the benefits of strong kerr response of atomic transition with the field confinement and gvd engineering accessible in hollow - core optical fibers , in particular those with cross section resembling a traditional japanese woven basket , which earned them a nickname kagome fibers , see fig .",
    "[ fig : kagome ] . in kagome fibers ,",
    "light propagates mainly inside the central hollow channel , which can be filed with a kerr media of choice .",
    "gvd can still be tailored by designing the fiber microstructure surrounding the channel , but it can furthermore by dynamically fine - tuned by changing the gas pressure , literally inflating the kagome fiber during the drawing process or even during the measurement @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "brioullin and raman processes in the fiber material are virtually avoided .",
    "first results have demonstrated squeezing in fibers filled with high pressure argon @xcite and mercury vapour @xcite .",
    "filling kagome fibers with alkali atom vapors has been proposed @xcite and attempted , but has not yet led to success because of chemically aggressive properties of such vapors .    extended interaction of",
    "strongly confined optical fields can be achieved not only in fibers , but also in resonators .",
    "in contrast to waveguides , resonators have discrete spectra consisting of nearly - equidistant modes . in this case the spm , cross - phase modulation ( xpm ) and four - wave mixing processes are clearly distinct .",
    "all these processes play their roles in the formation of kerr - combs in crystalline wgm resonators @xcite , such as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comb ] .",
    "wgm combs have been extensively discussed recently , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "the aspect that is directly relevant to our discussion is the photon - number correlation between multiple pairs of sidebands placed symmetrically on both sides of the pump wavelength labeled @xmath147 in fig .",
    "[ fig : comb ] .",
    "this correlation arises from the degenerate four - wave mixing ( or hyperparametric ) process of annihilation of two pump photons and creation a photon pair in two symmetric modes . below the oscillation threshold",
    "this process leads to the generation of entangled photon pairs .",
    "a number of experimental demonstrations of such pairs has emerged recently using on - chip fabricated silicon microring resonators @xcite .",
    "the time - energy entanglement was proved by violating bell s inequality in @xcite , and @xcite has demonstrated time - energy and polarization hyper - entanglement , also confirmed by bell s inequality violation .    above the threshold ,",
    "hyperparametric conversion leads to two - mode squeezing in a multitude of mode pairs .",
    "such squeezing was demonstrated in a microfabricated si@xmath148n@xmath149 ring @xcite , which is not strictly speaking a wgm resonator , but is closely related .",
    "the free spectral range of this resonator @xmath150 was large enough to allow selection of a single pair of squeezed modes by spectral filtering .",
    "these modes were found to be squeezed at the level of 1.7 db ( 5 db corrected for losses ) .",
    "broadband quadrature squeezing in a similar resonator has been theoretically predicted @xcite .    closing this section",
    ", we would like to mention that interaction of light with mechanical vibrations is not always harmful for preparation of non - classical light as in the case of gawbs .",
    "it can be used to one s advantage .",
    "recently , it was shown that squeezed light can be created by coupling light with a mechanical oscillator . here",
    "the radiation pressure quantum fluctuations induce the resonator motion which in turn imparts a phase shift to the laser light .",
    "intensity - dependent phase shift leads to optical squeezing in close analogy to the kerr effect . in this way squeezing of 1.7 db was demonstrated in a bulk cavity setup containing a thin partially transparent mechanical membrane @xcite .",
    "laser light is commonly believed to be the best real - world approximation of a coherent state of an optical mode .",
    "however this is not always the case .",
    "the nonlinear response of a laser cavity can lead to sub - poisson statistics of the emitted light , i.e. photon - number squeezing illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pq](f ) . to understand the physical mechanisms of intensity fluctuation suppression in lasers ,",
    "consider an experiment with a vacuum tube filled with mercury vapor , carried out in 1985 @xcite . in this experiment , a constant current flowing through the tube caused the fluorescence with the photon rate fluctuations below the shot noise . while the electrons emitted from the cathode have poisson statistics , their flow through the vacuum tube is regulated by both the anode potential and the space charge of the electron flow .",
    "if the current increases , so does the negative space charge , which leads to the current fluctuation suppression .",
    "in other words , the space charge acts as a compressible buffer , smoothing out these fluctuations below the classical limit , which is reflected in the emitted photons statistics .",
    "this is the same mechanism , which allowed schottky and spehnke @xcite to observe a sub shot noise electron current in a vacuum tube in 1937 .",
    "a similar mechanism is present in semiconductor lasers operating in the constant - current ( but not in the constant - voltage ) regime , where the junction voltage provides a negative feedback regulating the current in the region of recombination @xcite .",
    "this experiment was carried out using laser diodes at room temperature @xcite and at 77 k @xcite . in both cases",
    "approximately 1.7 db amplitude squeezing ( corrected for detectors efficiency ) was detected in a very broad frequency range .",
    "evidently , the squeezing measurement in these experiments was impeded by low collection efficiency .",
    "improving this efficiency by  face - to - face \" coupling of the laser diode and the photo diode , and cooling the assembly down to 66 k , the same group was able to boost the squeezing to 8.3 db @xcite .",
    "considering the 89% quantum efficiency of the photodiode , this corresponds to 14 db inferred squeezing .",
    "however , neither this nor other groups were later able to reproduce this large squeezing in a semiconductor laser , showing that there must be parameters not well understood and controlled in the initial experiment .",
    "nevertheless their experiment initiated work in other groups , which eventually led to a better understanding .",
    "although the space charge model gives a qualitative understanding of the phenomenon , it does not capture many important details . in 1995 ,",
    "marin _ et .",
    "_ conceded that  the very mechanisms capable of explaining why some laser diodes and not others were generating sub - shot - noise light remained unclear \" @xcite .",
    "they came to the conclusion that one of these mechanisms is the cross - talk between the main mode and other weakly excited modes , which should lead to their anti - correlation , i.e. two - mode or even multipartite squeezing .",
    "later , the same group developed a theoretical understanding by identifying two excess noise sources , the petermann excess noise and the leakage current noise , to explain the limitations of the squeezing observed @xcite .",
    "another relevant factor is the optical injection into the laser cavity .",
    "the effects of an external laser injection at 10 k @xcite and self - injection at room temperature @xcite were studied in quantum - well lasers . over 3 db @xcite and 1.8 db @xcite photon - number squeezing was observed .",
    "a weak squeezing in a free - running quantum - well laser was also observed at room temperature @xcite .",
    "the negative feedback suppressing the current ( and hence the optical power ) fluctuations does not necessarily have to be facilitated by the laser cavity . in section [ sec : spdc ]",
    "we already discussed an example of the electronic feedback derived from the signal measurement to control the idler photon statistics in pdc .",
    "a similar technique was applied to a semiconductor laser in 1986 by yamamoto _ et .",
    "because the laser beam lacks a quantum - correlated twin , yamamoto employed a xpm - based quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurement to monitor the output laser power .",
    "the power fluctuations of the laser beam were imprinted onto the phase of a probe beam , recovered in a heterodyne measurement , and fed back to the laser current . as a result , the amplitude squeezing ranging from 5 db at 16 mhz to 10 db below 2 mhz was observed .",
    "it might seem that a linear beam splitter could provide a simpler alternative to a qnd measurement in preparation of non - classical light with the feedback technique .",
    "this approach indeed leads to a very interesting field dynamics known as _ squashing _ @xcite .",
    "the term  squashing \" pertains to the fields propagating inside the loop , and is fundamentlly different from squeezing .",
    "the most remarkable property of the in - loop squashed optical field , theoretically shown by shapiro _",
    "@xcite , is that such a field does not obey the usual commutation relations .",
    "therefore it is not subject to heisenberg uncertainty principle , and its photon - number uncertainty can be reduced below the classical limit without the phase noise penalty @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that not only a state of an optical mode , but also a motional state of a trapped ion can be squashed in a feedback loop @xcite .    in the context of nonclassical light applications ,",
    "the possibility of generating optical fields not constrained by the heisenberg uncertainty relations appears too good to be true . and",
    "indeed , it has been shown that out - coupling the squashed field from the loop destroys its remarkable properties @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been pointed out @xcite that even fully characterizing these properties , which is only possible within the loop , is a highly nontrivial experimental problem that requires a qnd measurement . therefore using the electronic feedback systems for generating non - classical light",
    "has not attracted much of practical interest .",
    "using feedforward , on the other hand , is quite common in commercial optical devices known as  noise eaters \" that can suppress power fluctuations within the classical limit .",
    "it would seem that diode lasers offer the most robust and easily scalable technology for generating non - classical ( photon - number squeezed , or sub - poissonian ) light .",
    "they have also shown a promise in generating strongly squeezed states @xcite . however",
    "the interest to this field apparently waned in the first decade of the 21@xmath151 century .",
    "the reason for this skepticism could be that the discovery of the excess noise sources by maurin et al . @xcite made it clear that it is difficult to fabricate a laser that would _ predictably _ generate strong squeezing .",
    "if this is the case , a new advance in the field may be expected from improving the semiconductor technology .",
    "non - classical light has played an important role in development of quantum theory , starting form the early tests of local realism performed with entangled photons in 1972 @xcite . following this pioneering experiment , many striking quantum phenomena have been discovered via non - classical optics research .",
    "fluctuations of the optical field intensity have been suppressed below the shot - noise limit , which in classical notation requires negative probabilities .",
    "the concept of a _ biphoton _ , and later of a multipartite entangled state , was proven to be tangible .",
    "thus physicists gained hands - on experience with a system that may consist of space - like separated parts and yet constitute a single physical entity .",
    "quantum teleportation _ has been made possible with such systems .",
    "not only fundamental , but also applied science and technology have a lot to benefit from non - classical light .",
    "sub shot noise characteristics of the squeezed light directly points to one group of such applications : high resolution metrology . optical phase in an interferometer , optical beam displacement , sub - wavelength image discerning and recording are just a few topics from this group .",
    "information encoded in non - orthogonal single photon states or in any other non - orthogonal pure quantum states is protected from copying by fundamental laws of physics , which gives rise to another large group of applications concerned with information security .",
    "furthermore , this information can be processed using mind - blowing quantum logic operations ( such as e.g. a @xmath152 gate ) allowing , in perspective , to realize a quantum computer and the quantum internet .    but how is this wonderful non - classical light generated ?",
    "the purpose of this chapter has been to provide a brief introductory tour over the most common sources of quantum light .",
    "the variety of physical systems capable of generating non - classical light is very broad .",
    "we encountered atomic beams , vapor cells , laser - cooled atomic clouds and even individual trapped atoms or ions ; optical crystals and fibers ; semiconductor nanoparticles and diode lasers .",
    "with such a great variety of physical systems to discuss , we did not have an opportunity to provide much of detail regarding each system and its performance .",
    "instead , we rely on references that are strategically placed so that an interested reader would be able to easily  zoom in \" on any part of our review by downloading the appropriate publications .      * _ optical nonlinearity . _",
    "this is a driving mechanism for generating non - classical light .",
    "strongly nonlinear optical systems require less pump power and as a consequence are less noisy and more technologically acceptable .",
    "resonant nonlinearity of natural or artificial atoms , and broad - band nonlinearity of laser gain media are two examples that may surpass other systems by far . *",
    "_ optical loss .",
    "_ when photons are randomly removed from the system , statistics of the remaining photons becomes more and more poissonian .",
    "for many ( but not all ) quantum states this results in diminishing their non - classical characteristics , such as e. g. squeezing . for quantum states with zero displacement in phase space such as fock - states ,",
    "squeezed vacuum states , cat states ( i.e. superpositions of coherent states ) the statistical loss of a photon on average is enough to largely reduce the non - classical property @xcite .",
    "good examples of low - loss systems are optical nonlinear crystals and fibers . * _ mode structure .",
    "_ while imaging applications require multiple transverse modes , the applications concerned with sensing and information processing may require strictly single - mode light .",
    "bulk nonlinear crystals are natural sources for multimode light ; on the other hand wavequides , fibers and optical cavities can be used to achieve single - mode operation . * _ wavelength and bandwidth . _ using non - classical light in conjunction with  massive \" qubits , as suggested by the quantum network paradigm , requires matching their central wavelengths and bandwidths .",
    "therefore these source parameters either need to be precisely engineered , which is possible with atom - based sources , or tunable .",
    "wavelength tuning is readily available in bulk crystals , but their emission is usually very broad - band .",
    "fine - tuning of parametric light to atomic transitions in both central wavelength and bandwidth has been achieved with sub- or above - threshold opos . *",
    "_ practical utility .",
    "_ it is generally desirable to avoid cryogenic temperatures and other stringent environment requirements .",
    "unfortunately , many of quantum dot , quantum well and trapped atoms sources of non - classical light fail this requirement .",
    "therefore , progress may come via two different routes : ( 1 ) improving room temperature systems , or ( 2 ) developing compact sources and low cost cryogenic fridges .    in general , we see that progress in quantum optics comes from developing : ( 1 ) light sources , ( 2 ) light confinement strategies , ( 3 ) materials with strong optically non - linear response . for a particular goal",
    ", one achieves the best result if one optimizes the combination of items from these three categories .",
    "we have already discussed one such example , a hollow - core fiber filled with atom media , and it appears plausible that more such examples may emerge in the future .",
    "let us consider the following series of thought experiments .",
    "the toolbox we need contains a source of laser light , a beam splitter , two time resolving detectors of high bandwidth , and electronic equipment to analyze the detector signals . in the first experiment ( 1 ) measuring the intensity correlations after splitting the laser light with the beam splitter yields a @xmath153 which is independent of time @xmath154 .",
    "this can be described by a classical model namely classical light fields without fluctuations - fine .",
    "now the second experiment ( 2 ) is to measure the intensity of the laser light as a function of time .",
    "the result is a fluctuating detector signal ( corresponding to the poisson statistics of the photons in a quantum language ) .",
    "this can also be described by a classical model in which the classical electric fields fluctuate - this is also fine , but note that the models required are not compatible .",
    "you may not be satisfied and argue that the fluctuation observed in experiment ( 2 ) may well come from the detector itself contributing noise .",
    "this would average out in experiment ( 1 ) because the noise introduced by the two detectors is of course not correlated . but suppose the lab next door happens to have amplitude squeezed light , with intensity fluctuations suppressed by 15 db below the shot noise .",
    "measuring the squeezed light intensity noise you convince yourself easily that the detector does not introduce enough noise to explain experiment ( 2 ) .",
    "note that this test should convince you even if you have no clue what the squeezed light is .",
    "but you do not want to give up so easily and you say ",
    "what if a classically noisy light field enters the second input port , uncorrelated with the laser light but likewise modeled by classical stochastic fluctuations \" .",
    "and you are right , this more involved classical model would explain both experiments ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) - yet there is ( 3 ) a third experiment we can do .",
    "we can check the intensity of the light arriving at this second input port of the beam splitter and no matter how sensitive the intensity measuring detectors are they will detect no signal .",
    "but this is not compatible with a classical model : classical fluctuations always lead to measurable intensity noise .",
    "we conclude by noting that obviously coherent states are non - classical because there is no single classical stochastic model which describes all possible experiments with laser light . but",
    "as we have seen it is tedious to go through these arguments , and no simple measure of nonclassicality was found so far qualifying a coherent state as noclassical . on the other hand ,",
    "the nonclassical nature of a coherent state is used in some quantum protocols . having gone through this lengthy argument it seems important to note that also thermal states , i.e. mixed quantum states , can still be somewhat nonclassical in nature if the classical excess noise is not too much larger than the underlying quantum uncertainty .",
