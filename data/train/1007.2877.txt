    "the phase diagram of qcd is a much - studied phenomenon , but still its characteristics , at finite baryon chemical potential in particular , are far from being settled @xcite .",
    "while at zero chemical potential all the monte carlo ( mc ) and effective model studies tend to support a common picture , at nonzero chemical potential the mc results are inconclusive .    at zero chemical potential",
    "the widely accepted phase diagram in the @xmath8-@xmath4 plane exhibits both at small and at large quark masses regions of first order phase transition each bounded by a line of second order critical endpoints ( cep ) . in between these regions ,",
    "the transition is of analytic crossover type .",
    "if we introduce a nonzero quark baryon chemical potential @xmath5 , the second order cep lines extend to a critical surface .",
    "if the critical surface lying closer to the origin of the mass - plane bends upwards , that is to larger quark masses , then there is a possibility that a crossover transition becomes at larger chemical potential a second , and subsequently a first order phase transition .",
    "direct mc simulations @xcite and also the estimates in @xcite give a finite @xmath9 value , and similar conclusions can be drawn from other lattice techniques , too @xcite",
    ". however , the second order surface seems to bend downwards , to smaller quark masses , according to a lattice study of the curvature performed in @xcite using imaginary chemical potential .",
    "although all these lattice results do not necessarily contradict each other , they could imply a scenario in which the critical surface has a non - trivial shape .",
    "some numerical evidence for such a possibility is given in @xcite .    beyond direct simulations one can approach the study of the phase structure of qcd through effective theories , see _",
    "@xcite for reviews . at finite chemical potential",
    "there are several results on the chiral phase transition for two flavors in nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) models , as well as in linear sigma models @xcite . using the @xmath3 linear sigma model an interesting phase structure with two ceps in the @xmath10 plane",
    "was reported for low values of the pion mass in @xcite .",
    "considering three flavors , one can study in these models the properties of the chiral critical surface @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the authors used the @xmath11 chiral sigma model near the physical point , and found that in the available parameter space the critical surface bends upwards , supporting the direct mc result . in @xcite , in the framework of the extended njl model the authors found a down - bending surface for small chemical potential which eventually turns back at higher values of @xmath12 this behavior would conciliate the two mc scenarios within a single critical surface if the turning happens at positive values of @xmath13 @xmath4 and finite values of @xmath5 .",
    "other possible behaviors of the critical surface were discussed in @xcite using the gibbs phase rule for phase coexistence .    in the chiral limit ( @xmath14 ) , there are two well - known limits , the @xmath7 and the infinite strange quark mass ( @xmath15 ) limits . at @xmath7",
    "we have a first order phase transition region for small @xmath4 , a second order transition region at large @xmath4 and a tricritical point ( tcp ) separating them , with a characteristic value @xmath16 at @xmath15 and small chemical potential we have second order , for large @xmath5 a first order phase transition , with again a tcp in between .",
    "the line of tcps is the intercept of the critical surface and the @xmath17 plane . according to the above scenarios the two tcps at the @xmath7 and @xmath15 can be connected by a single line with definite curvature , a back - bending line , or they may belong to two distinct tcp lines . in the latter case",
    "there must be two disjunct critical surfaces in the @xmath18 space , of which these two tcp lines are just the endpoints in the @xmath17 plane @xcite .",
    "in this paper we attempt to describe the behavior of the tricritical line in the chiral limit of the @xmath19 sigma model @xcite , assuming in addition that the mass of the constituent strange quark and the anomaly scale are much larger than the critical temperature .",
    "the study of the chiral limit has some advantages , since one can work with much less parameters than in a generic situation .",
    "a disadvantage though , is that in this case there are no direct measurements which could connect the effective model parameters with the qcd ( although , strictly speaking , there are no such measurements anywhere , apart from the physical point , especially not for a possible chemical potential dependence of the parameters ) .",
    "the goal of this study is to explore the parameter dependence of the tcp line .",
    "the assumption that the constituent strange mass is much larger than @xmath20 is based on the observation that even at the physical point of the mass plane the constituent strange quark mass is @xmath21  mev , while @xmath22  mev , and the critical line in the @xmath23 plane behaves as @xmath24 as one approaches the @xmath4 axis , which predicts for @xmath25 and for the mass of the strange constituent quark a higher value than the corresponding mass at the physical point .",
    "actually , in the lattice study of @xcite it was estimated that @xmath26 while in @xcite using the @xmath19 sigma model @xmath25 was estimated to be one order of magnitude bigger than the value of @xmath4 at the physical point .",
    "a similar observation can be made for the anomaly scale , which is connected to the mass of the @xmath27 meson . in this physical situation",
    "we have a multi - scale system , where a simple one - loop analysis would lose the contribution of the heavy sector .",
    "instead , we have to work with decoupling theory @xcite which results in a hierarchy of effective models describing the physics at lower and lower scales : first the @xmath4 strange quark sector decouples with the corresponding bosonic degrees of freedom , and we obtain an effective @xmath2 symmetric theory . then the @xmath27 sector ( which has semi - large masses at @xmath28 because of the anomaly ) decouples , and we are left with the @xmath3 chiral sigma model consisting of pion and sigma mesons , as well as the @xmath29 and @xmath30 constituent quarks . here",
    "we can use the results of @xcite to determine the position of tcp for a given parameters set .",
    "the effect of the strange sector on the position of the tcp is only through the modified parameters of the @xmath3 chiral sigma model . to determine the parameters of the different effective models involved in the analysis we use the one - loop @xmath31-function governed running of these parameters and matching of the corresponding @xmath32-point functions in the common validity range of the models .",

    "we are interested in the regime where the vacuum structure of the theory contains a heavy @xmath50-quark sector and a light @xmath51 sector , with a corresponding meson sector . for the constituent quark sector",
    "this mass hierarchy can be fulfilled with @xmath52 , since at tree - level the @xmath50-quark mass is @xmath53 , while @xmath54 .",
    "we assume that the mesons containing @xmath50-quark have a mass of order @xmath55 while the rest have a mass of order @xmath56 no splitting is assumed between @xmath29 and @xmath30 quark masses .",
    "after having made all these assumptions , the mass spectrum , and correspondingly the physics splits into a heavy and a light part .",
    "the light sector influences only very little the symmetry breaking pattern of the heavy sector , therefore we may set @xmath57 when dealing with the determination of the heavy masses .",
    "then we find the following mass relations : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the mass for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the mass of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , @xmath65 applies for @xmath66 and @xmath67 modes , @xmath68 is the mass of @xmath69 and finally , @xmath4 is the strange quark mass . in case of a large strange quark mass , _",
    "i.e. _ large @xmath70 values , the lightness of the pion - sigma sector requires that @xmath71 .",
    "this can be achieved only with fine - tuning @xmath72  after all this is the manifestation of the hierarchy problem , where the high energy sector influences , through radiative corrections and spontaneous symmetry breaking , the light sector . to circumvent the problem",
    ", we parametrize everything with the light @xmath73-mass : @xmath74 we see that there is a third mass scale , associated to @xmath75",
    ". since @xmath44 has the dimension of a mass , we can relate its value to @xmath70 or @xmath76 , and it is a matter of the low - lying dynamics determining the details of the effective model to know which is the `` true '' ratio between them . in this work",
    "we try to play around the possible values of @xmath44 to see its effect on the thermodynamics .",
    "so , after all , we have three possibly very different mass scales , @xmath77 and @xmath76 .",
    "the thermodynamics of the system , which is related to the spontaneous breaking in the non - strange sector , must take place at the light scales , that is at @xmath78 .",
    "to treat a physical system with vastly different mass scales is possible only using the fact that for the light physics the heavy degrees of freedom decouple , and their presence can be identified through the values of the parameters of the lagrangian containing the light degrees of freedom .",
    "how this decoupling works in detail , is summarized in the next section .",
    "here we review the generic principles of decoupling described in details in @xcite .",
    "let us start with a theory with lagrangian @xmath79 , coupling constant set @xmath80 ( this includes also the masses ) and field contents generically denoted with @xmath42 and @xmath81 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath42 is much heavier than @xmath82 , their masses are denoted by @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "then we want to establish an effective theory based exclusively on the light degrees of freedom .",
    "let us denote the lagrangian of this effective theory by @xmath85 , its couplings are @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) and the field content is @xmath88 with mass @xmath89 .",
    "we emphasize that , although @xmath88 corresponds to the light degrees of freedom @xmath82 of the complete theory , they can differ by wave function renormalization . in general the wave function renormalization and the renormalized couplings of the effective",
    "theory depend on the coupling constants of the original theory : @xmath90 if we assume that the couplings of the effective model at tree level are linear combinations of the original couplings , then we can write @xmath91,\\ ] ] where @xmath92 denotes the loop corrections which depend on all of the original couplings .    in order to determine these relations we use matching : we take @xmath93 correlators of the light fields at some external momentum , and require that their physical value be the same in the original and in the effective model . if we denote the @xmath32-point functions of the original and effective model by @xmath94 then we require in fourier space @xmath95 for fixed @xmath96 .",
    "the right hand side contains , as radiative corrections , the effect of heavy modes .    in perturbation",
    "theory the @xmath32-point functions depend also on the renormalization scales @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively . in general , we expect to obtain all type of logarithmic corrections @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is any energy scale which shows up in the given @xmath32-point function . in loop integrals",
    "we typically find @xmath101 , where the mass can be @xmath102 on the right , or @xmath103 on the left hand side . in order not to have multiple mass scales in the @xmath32-point functions ( which would lead to large logarithms )",
    "we shall choose @xmath104 , then all scales are of the order of @xmath83 .",
    "this means that for the best convergence of the perturbative series we shall also choose @xmath105 . in consequence",
    "the relation is in fact established at scale @xmath83 : @xmath106 in the original theory the couplings may be defined on a different energy scale , @xmath107 .",
    "then , we have to run the couplings according to @xmath79 in order to find @xmath108 which is needed above . on the other hand ,",
    "_ defines _",
    "@xmath109 on the scale @xmath83 .",
    "if we need them on a lower energy scale @xmath110 , then we have to run them according to @xmath85 , the effective model lagrangian .",
    "if there are multiple scales to decouple , we have a series of effective models @xmath111 with coupling constants @xmath112 where the heaviest field has a mass @xmath113 .",
    "then the matching conditions described above lead to the series of equations @xmath114 this defines the new couplings @xmath115 at the mass scale @xmath113 which , from the point of view of the @xmath116th effective model , is a high energy scale .",
    "then the running of the couplings between @xmath117 is governed by the lagrangian @xmath118 .",
    "this process leads to the schematic running depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig : schemplot ] .     and @xmath119 is governed by @xmath120.,height=151 ]    in the most simple version we use tree level matching , which means that we neglect the @xmath121 terms .",
    "we use this approximations throughout this work .",
    "moreover , we use the lowest order ( one - loop ) beta functions for running .",
    "we start with the @xmath0 symmetric linear sigma model which is parametrized at the heavy , strange mass scale in order to avoid the need for running .",
    "after the decoupling of the strange sector we are left with a @xmath2 model , starting at @xmath4 scale .",
    "the beta - functions of this model determines the running of the coupling down to @xmath122 , when we switch to @xmath3 model containing only the @xmath123 and @xmath124 mesons and the @xmath29 and @xmath30 constituent quarks .",
    "we perform in this model the running of their couplings from @xmath122 down to @xmath125 scale , where the finite temperature study is performed .",
    "a separate treatment is needed when we treat the light masses of the system . at one hand , due to the rg running , they acquire logarithmic dependence on the heavy scale .",
    "on the other hand , because of the hierarchy problem discussed in the previous section , the light mass squared @xmath72 have to be fine tuned by @xmath126 in order to keep the light sector truely light . therefore in bosonic models",
    "the logarithmic corrections from the rg running are subleading , and so they should be neglected .",
    "we use with a background @xmath70 taken into account via the shift @xmath49 .",
    "the first step is to parametrize the heavy sector by determining the parameters of the model at scale @xmath4 .",
    "then , as a next step , we perform the decoupling of the heavy ( strange ) sector .",
    "we should fix the parameters of the heavy sector by measurements , but there exist no direct mass measurements in this regime .",
    "therefore we are forced to make some assumptions .",
    "since we are in a large quark mass regime , we can not use the results of the chiral perturbation theory . instead , the heavy constituent quark model approach , where the mass of the heavy particles are simply the sum of the constituent quark masses , seems to be more adequate . in case of the light - heavy mesons",
    "this works nicely , since we can require @xmath127 in the doubly heavy sector there is a mismatch between the scalar ( @xmath69 ) and pseudoscalar ( @xmath128 ) meson masses , although the constituent quark model would give the same mass for both .",
    "the reason in this model is that there is a symmetry breaking effect in addition to the constituent quark masses . to treat this situation",
    "we introduce a free parameter @xmath129 , and require that some average of the two mass squared is @xmath130 : @xmath131 which results in a relation between the two quartic coupling constants @xmath132 and @xmath133 @xmath134 if @xmath135 , _",
    "i.e. _ when @xmath136 , @xmath137 is the smallest value for @xmath132 .",

    "this value will determine the original , zero temperature strange quark mass .",
    "the next step is to eliminate the strange sector , and determine the parameters of the resulting effective model .",
    "the effective model will contain the following degrees of freedom : the upper two ( @xmath146 ) components in @xmath147 , denoted by @xmath148 and the upper left @xmath149 submatrix in @xmath150 denoted by @xmath151 and containing the @xmath152 and @xmath124 fields : @xmath153{c}\\psi_2\\cr s\\cr \\end{array}\\right),\\qquad    \\phi =    \\left(\\begin{array}[c]{cc } \\phi_2 \\ ; & \\displaystyle        \\frac1{\\sqrt{2 } } { \\bm k}_+\\cr \\displaystyle \\frac1{\\sqrt{2}}{\\bm          k}_-^\\dagger \\quad & \\displaystyle \\frac1{\\sqrt{2}}(\\sigma_y+i\\eta_y )        \\cr\\end{array}\\right),\\qquad { \\bm k}_\\pm = { \\bm\\kappa}\\pm i{\\bm k }    = \\left ( \\begin{array}[c]{c } \\kappa^+\\pm ik^+ \\cr \\kappa^0\\pm        ik^0 \\end{array}\\right).\\ ] ] we split the lagrangian - according to this characterization of degrees of freedom .",

    "<S> one - loop level beta functions for the running of the parameters in each of these models and tree - level matching of the coupling of these models performed at intermediate scales are used to determine the influence of the heavy sector on the parameters of the @xmath3 linear sigma model . by investigating the thermodynamics of this latter model we identified the tricritical surface of the @xmath0 linear sigma model in the chiral limit . to apply the results for qcd we used different scenarios for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 dependence of the effective model parameters , then the @xmath6 function can be determined . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the details , a curve bending upwards or downwards near @xmath7 can be obtained , while with explicit chemical potential dependence of the parameters the direction of the curve can change with @xmath4 , too . </S>"
