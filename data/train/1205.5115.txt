    "after the experimental observation of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite , there has been great interest in the problem of stabilization of bec on a periodic optical lattice ( ol ) potential .",
    "the ol potential is generated in a laboratory by a standing wave polarized laser beam @xcite .",
    "the resulting periodic potential simulates the potential seen by an electron in a solid @xcite . as one of the interests in studying bec droplets of small number of atoms on ol is to generate a stable array of bec droplets by occupying each ol site with one tiny droplet so that an array of matter wave is formed as in condensed - matter physics @xcite . unlike in condensed - matter physics ,",
    "these bec droplets are completely pure .",
    "such a pure array of matter - wave simulating a quantum solid can be created and studied in a laboratory to model many quantum - mechanical condensed - matter phenomena .    the above study to model condensed - matter phenomena with matter wave has obtained new impetus after the observation of dipolar bec of @xmath0cr @xcite and @xmath1dy @xcite with a large dipolar interaction .",
    "the dipolar interaction is anisotropic and of long range in contrast to the short - range isotropic atomic interaction . because of the anisotropic long - range interaction , the conditions of stability of a dipolar bec soliton follow a distinct trend from that of a nondipolar bec soliton @xcite .",
    "also , dipolar atoms have permanent magnetic moment @xcite and if polarized by an external magnetic field , an array of tiny bec droplets with magnetic moment can simulate the problem of generation of magnetism in solids from individual atomic or molecular magnetic dipoles .    here , using a three - dimensional ( 3d ) mean - field model , we study one - dimensional ( 1d ) dipolar bec solitons , free to move along the polarization direction @xmath2 , on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) square and triangular periodic ol in the @xmath3-@xmath4 plane . in both cases , for a fixed dipolar interaction and fixed number of atoms , the solitons are stable for atomic short - range interaction ( scattering length ) between two critical limiting values . below the lower limit the dipolar and short - range interactions lead to too much attraction and",
    "the soliton collapses and above the upper limit the net attraction is too weak and the soliton escapes to infinity .",
    "the spreading of the bec soliton in the 2d ol in the @xmath3-@xmath4 plane is stopped by the attractive dipolar interaction along polarization direction @xmath2 @xmath5 the system lowers its energy by being long in the @xmath2 direction and thin in the @xmath3-@xmath4 plane .",
    "first , we consider a dipolar bec soliton on a 2d square or triangular ol using the numerical and lagrangian variational analysis of the mean - field gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation .",
    "the variational results are found to be in good agreement with numerical results . to demonstrate the stability , we perform a linear stability analysis @xcite using the variational solution and calculate the normal - mode frequencies @xcite .    in an attempt to generate an array of dipolar bec solitons on a 2d square ol , each with a small number of atoms",
    ", we find that interesting stable periodic structure can be formed for filling factors of 1/2 , 1/3 , and 1/4 termed checkerboard , stripe , and star configurations , respectively .",
    "similar stable structures of ultra - cold dipolar atoms were first obtained as mott insulator states in a study of dipolar atoms on 2d ol by solving the corresponding _ field - theoretic _",
    "2d hubbard model numerically by monte carlo technique @xcite .",
    "this suggests that such stable structures are a consequence of the typical repulsive dipolar interaction in the @xmath3-@xmath4 plane .",
    "there have been studies of 2d dipolar bec solitons , free to move in the @xmath3-@xmath2 or @xmath3-@xmath4 plane with harmonic traps along @xmath4 @xcite or @xmath2 @xcite axis , respectively , and of 1d dipolar bec soliton under transverse harmonic trap @xcite .",
    "the present 1d dipolar bec soliton confined by only a weak 2d ol in the @xmath3-@xmath4 plane is distinct .",
    "the bec soliton of the previous studies @xcite will essentially have a gaussian density distribution along the infinite trap direction , whereas the present bec soliton will have an exponential density distribution due to weak finite ol traps in these directions .",
    "similar nondipolar bec solitons in a lower dimensional ol have also been studied @xcite .",

    "however , the array is stable if they are placed along the diagonal directions . with this information",
    ", we see that a stable periodic 2d pattern of tiny solitons is obtained if the occupation of neighboring sites is avoided . at the maximum of a filling factor of 1/2",

    "it is interesting to note that this checkerboard pattern is a stable mott insulator state obtained by solving the bose - hubbard model on a 2d lattice with repulsive long - range dipolar interaction @xcite .",

    "we considered such configurations with the present tiny dipolar bec soliton droplets . by reducing the filling factor from 1/2 to 1/3 or 1/4",
    "we have a lower occupation of sites and hence a lower inter - site interaction .",
    "as such arrays get destroyed due to the long - range inter - site interaction , a reduced inter - site interaction implies that the stripe and star configurations of the bec soliton droplets are stable .",
    "we established the stability of the stripe and star configurations using real - time propagation of the gp equation . in figs .",

    "the initial and final configurations are practically indistinguishable , demonstrating the stability .",
    "to summarize , using the mean - field 3d gp equation we demonstrated a stable dipolar bec soliton polarized along the axial @xmath2 direction on a weak square or triangular 2d ol in the orthogonal @xmath3-@xmath4 plane .",
    "we considered identical ol strengths along different directions and considered a lagrangian variational analysis of the gp equation with a gaussian ansatz in addition to the numerical solution of the same using the split - step crank - nicolson method .",
    "the stabilization of the bec was established by the linear stability analysis @xcite .",
    "the widths and energies obtained from the numerical solution of the gp equation are in agreement with the corresponding variational results .",
    "we also considered stable 2d arrays formed by arranging identical tiny dipolar bec solitons on different sites of a 2d square ol .",
    "such an array is unstable if any two adjacent ol sites are occupied .",
    "the simplest stable periodic 2d array of superfluid dipolar bec solitons , known as the checkerboard configuration , emerges if the sites are arranged diagonally with a filling factor of 1/2 .",
    "similar 2d arrays , known as stripe and star configurations for filling factors 1/3 and 1/4 , respectively are also found to be stable .",
    "previously , in the study of ultra - cold dipolar atoms on strict 2d lattice using the monte carlo simulation of the 2d bose - hubbard model , such stable arrays of mott insulator states emerged at filling factors of 1/2 , 1/3 , and 1/4 @xcite .",
    "similar stable configurations obtained in the mean - field gp and field - theoretic bose - hubbard approaches possibly indicate the general stability property of such structures under the long - range repulsive dipolar interaction in the @xmath3-@xmath4 plane .",
