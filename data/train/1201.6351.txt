    "a straight current - carrying wire held in tension between pole faces of a magnet is well known to buckle into a ( roughly ) helical configuration at a critical current ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hel : exp - setup ] ) .",
    "a photograph of this phenomenon is shown in section 10.4.3 of @xcite , where a linear stability analysis is carried out for a simple string model .",
    "( a string is here meant to be a perfectly flexible elastic wire . )",
    "the problem was studied by wolfe @xcite by means of a rigorous bifurcation analysis for a ( nonlinearly elastic ) string suspended between fixed supports and placed in a uniform magnetic field directed parallel to the undeformed wire .",
    "he found that an infinite number of solution branches bifurcate from the trivial straight solution , much like in the euler elastica under compressive load . in this case",
    "the non - trivial solutions are exact helices .",
    "that this should be so , is easily explained by the fact that the ( lorentz ) body force is everywhere normal to the deformed configuration and hence the wire necessarily in a uniform state of tension .",
    "some ( statics ) stability results ( i.e. , minimisation of the potential energy ) were also obtained , indicating that the first branch of solutions is stable while the others are unstable .        in a subsequent paper wolfe @xcite",
    "extends the analysis to a uniformly rotating ( whirling ) string and shows again the existence of bifurcating branches of whirling non - trivial solutions .",
    "due to centrifugal effects no closed - form solutions could be obtained in this case .",
    "this result was further extended by healey @xcite using equivariant bifurcation theory in order to deal with the symmetries of the problem .",
    "wolfe also considered a conducting _ rod _ in a uniform magnetic field @xcite .",
    "in addition to extension a rod can undergo flexure , torsion and shear , and for the case of welded boundary conditions it was found that in certain cases bifurcation occurs , with the usual infinity of non - trivial equilibrium states . all the works cited above were content with showing the existence of bifurcating solutions and did not study their post - buckling behaviour .",
    "in this paper we consider the post - buckling behaviour of a conducting rod .",
    "wolfe considered welded boundary conditions in @xcite and encountered degeneracies ( even - dimensional eigenspaces ) because of rotational symmetry of the problem . in previous work @xcite",
    "we showed that further complications occur and that magnetic buckling of a welded transversely isotropic rod ( i.e. , a rod with unequal bending stiffnesses about the two principal axes of its cross - section ) is described by a remarkably degenerate pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "wolfe also reported numerical evidence of helical post - buckling solutions .",
    "however , exact helical solutions can not be supported by ( coaxial ) welded boundary conditions .",
    "here we formulate a novel set of what we call ` coat hanger ' boundary conditions that do support ( i.e. , are compatible with ) exact helical solutions , and show that subject to these boundary conditions an isotropic rod does indeed buckle ( exclusively ) into a helix , or more precisely , that there is an infinite series of helical modes bifurcating at increasing load , each successive mode having one more ( half ) helical turn . all helical solutions can be obtained explicitly and it is found that the pitchfork bifurcations for these coat hanger boundary conditions are non - degenerate and that the critical loads are given by a remarkably simple formula . unlike in string buckling a rod does not require a tensile force in the trivial state , but we allow for such an applied force as well .",
    "the pertinent dimensionless parameter that governs buckling measures the product of current and magnetic field against the bending force .",
    "we also study steady whirling solutions for which we introduce a rotating coordinate system .",
    "this extends wolfe s analysis of whirling strings to whirling rods .",
    "an interesting feature of helical solutions is that since all points on a helix have equal distance to the whirling axis , and are therefore equally affected by centrifugal forces , solutions remain helical when spun .",
    "we perform a stability analysis by computing eigenvalues of the linearised boudary - value problem about a ( quasi - stationary ) whirling solution . for this",
    "we use a continuation ( or homotopy ) approach that takes advantage of the fact that exact expressions for the ( imaginary ) eigenvalues can be obtained in an appropriate limit ( no spin , no magnetic field ) .",
    "the eigenvalues in this limit are then traced as system parameters are varied .",
    "whirl tends to destabilise the helical solutions , but stable solutions can be obtained by adding the effect of internal viscoelastic damping .",
    "we find hopf bifurcations on the first bifurcating branch where a stable whirling solution becomes unstable under an increase of the angular velocity .",
    "we also briefly consider anisotropic rods .",
    "critical loads can still be obtained analytically , but these rods buckle into coiled but non - helical solutions .",
    "secondary instabilities are found due to hamiltonian - hopf bifurcations , a common signature of ` breathing ' or ` flutter ' instabilities in mechanical systems .",
    "helical solutions are widely studied in a whole range of applications",
    ". often these solutions are thought to arise through buckling of a straight rod under the action of end loads .",
    "however , as commented above , exact helical solutions are not supported by the usual set of boundary conditions .",
    "consequently , boundary conditions are often not mentioned , or the rod is implicitly assumed to be infinitely long in order to prevent end effects @xcite .",
    "one of the contributions of this paper is to present and highlight boundary conditions for an elastic rod that do support helical solutions .",
    "one could apply these experimentally if one was interested in generating or studying helical solutions in a finite - length rod .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the rod mechanics formulation , in which the magnetic field enters the force balance equation through the lorentz body force .",
    "the coat hanger boundary conditions are introduced together with a sketch of a device that can be constructed to realise these boundary conditions in a testing rig . for the study of whirling solutions the equilibrium equations",
    "are transformed to a coordinate system rotating at constant angular velocity .",
    "we use numerical bifurcation and continuation methods to find the buckling loads and to compute post - buckling solution paths , both for the statics and dynamics case . after the nondimensionalisation in section 3 ,",
    "the linearisation is presented in section 4 .",
    "section 5 first presents analytical stability results for the statics case and then introduces our continuation approach to numerical stability analysis of the full system . in section",
    "6 results are presented in the form of bifurcation diagrams and curves of hopf bifurcations in appropriate parameter planes .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section 7 and the study closes with two appendices : one giving details about the linearised system of equations and one deriving exact buckling results for helical solutions .",
    "the latter is complementary to the bifurcation analysis ( not assuming any shape ) in section 5 ; together these analyses give a complete picture of helical magnetic buckling .",
    "we describe the elastic behaviour of a conducting cable by the kirchhoff equations for the dynamics of thin rods .",
    "the rod is assumed to be uniform , inextensible , unshearable and intrinsically straight and prismatic .",
    "the assumptions of inextensibility and unshearability are appropriate for thin rods with relatively low external ( here electrodynamic ) forces . for the background of the kirchhoff equations the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite .",
    "these equations were also used in @xcite and @xcite to analyse the dynamics of a spinning tether .",
    "let @xmath0 denote the position of the rod s centreline and let @xmath1 be a right - handed orthonormal frame of directors ( the cosserat triad ) defined at each point along the centreline . since the centreline is assumed to be inextensible we can take @xmath2 in the direction of the local tangent : @xmath3    where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to arclength @xmath4 measured along the centreline , and @xmath5 is time . the directors",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 will be taken to point along the principal bending axes of the cross - section ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cosserat ] ) .",
    "the unstressed rod is taken to lie along the basis vector @xmath8 of a fixed inertial frame @xmath9 .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : cosserat ] we note that the position vector of an arbitrary point of the rod can be expressed as @xmath10    where @xmath11 are the components of @xmath12 in the cross - section relative to @xmath13 .",
    "the rod is thus viewed as a set of infinitesimal slices centred at all @xmath4 .",
    "a one - dimensional description will be obtained by averaging of forces and moments over each cross - section .",
    "the internal traction , which is the projection of the stress tensor onto the cross - sectional plane , is given by a force which we denote by @xmath14 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cosserat ] ) . the resultant elastic force exerted in a section @xmath15",
    "is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an infinitesimal area element .",
    "this force can be expressed in the director basis as @xmath18 .",
    "the resultant moment in the section @xmath15 is given by @xmath19 and will be expressed as @xmath20 .",
    "the rod is assumed to carry an electric current for which we can write @xmath21 here we have assumed the current to have the same direction as the rod , which is consistent with a one - dimensional rod theory .",
    "it amounts to the assumption that the cross - section of the conducting wire is small enough to make currents within the cross - section ( eddy currents ) induced by the motion negligible .",
    "the current @xmath22 interacts with the magnetic field @xmath23 to generate a ( lorentz ) body force given by @xmath24 following @xcite we assume the magnetic field to be uniform and directed along the unstressed rod , i.e. , @xmath25    the balancing of forces and moments across an infinitesimal rod element then yields the following set of partial differential equations @xcite : @xmath26 @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the ( volumetric ) mass density , @xmath29 the cross - sectional area , @xmath30 and @xmath31 the second moment of area of the cross - section about @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , and @xmath32 denotes differentiation with respect to time .    for a closed system of equations",
    "these balance equations need to be supplemented by constitutive relations that characterise the material behaviour of the rod .",
    "we assume the rod to be made of homogeneous isotropic linear viscoelastic material so that stress - strain relations , based on a model by valverde et al .",
    "@xcite , are @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the curvatures about @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , while @xmath36 is the twist about @xmath2 .",
    "the constant @xmath37 is the viscoelastic coefficient of the material , @xmath38 is young s modulus , @xmath39 is the shear modulus and @xmath40 is the second moment of area of the section about @xmath2 .",
    "we shall assume that the section is symmetric with respect to the principal axes , in which case @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath42 are the components of the curvature vector @xmath43 which governs the evolution in space of the frame of directors as one moves along the centreline : @xmath44    the constitutive relations ( [ eq : constitutive1 ] ) can be used to replace the @xmath42 in ( [ eq : twist ] ) by moments , after which the equations ( [ eqtangent1 ] ) , ( [ eq : lmomentum2 ] ) , ( [ eq : amomentum2 ] ) and ( [ eq : twist ] ) form a system of 18 differential equations for the 18 unknowns @xmath45 .",
    "+ * remark : * we ignore in this study secondary electrodynamic effects ( such as an induced emf and hence additional current in the conductor ) as a result of the motion of the wire in the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "since we are considering a steadily rotating wire these effects would be null on the configuration of the wire .",
    "however , the same would not be true for the stability analysis , which considers arbitrary time - dependent perturbations .",
    "we assume that these induction effects are negligible .",
    "we shall also be interested in steadily rotating solutions and therefore we transform the equilibrium equations ( [ eq : lmomentum2 ] ) and ( [ eq : amomentum2 ] ) to a coordinate frame @xmath46 that rotates with constant angular velocity @xmath47 about the @xmath8 axis ( and the axis of the rod in its trivial unstressed state ) .",
    "noting that the derivative with respect to time of an arbitrary vector @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 indicates the derivative with respect to time in the inertial frame and @xmath51 stands for the derivative with respect to time in the moving frame , the equations ( [ eq : lmomentum2 ] ) and ( [ eq : amomentum2 ] ) expressed relative to @xmath46 become @xmath52 @xmath53 the second term on the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : lmomentum4 ] ) is the coriolis force , while the third term is the centrifugal force , as a result of the rotating coordinate system .",
    "steadily rotating ( whirling ) solutions satisfy the equations ( [ eq : lmomentum4 ] ) and ( [ eq : amomentum4 ] ) with the dotted variables set to zero : @xmath54 @xmath55 the other equations ( [ eqtangent1 ] ) and ( [ eq : twist ] ) do not change their form , but all vectors are now to be considered as expressed relative to the rotating frame @xmath46 .",
    "statical solutions are simply obtained by setting @xmath56 equal to zero .    for a well - posed problem",
    "the final 18 odes require 18 boundary conditions to be specified , which we do next .",
    "helical solutions in rods are usually studied in infinitely long rods , which avoids the need for imposing boundary conditions .",
    "indeed , it is not immediately clear how an exact helix can be supported : the boundary conditions can not be simply welded as no two points on a helix have coaxial tangents , nor can they be simply pinned because a helix has curvature and therefore carries a bending moment . here",
    "we formulate a set of boundary conditions that support exact helical solutions .",
    "we call them coat hanger boundary conditions , for obvious reasons .",
    "consider fig .",
    "[ fig : hel : bc ] where a rod is suspended between two axes @xmath57 ( at @xmath58 ) and @xmath59 ( at @xmath60 ) lying in two parallel planes normal to @xmath61 .",
    "axis @xmath59 is taken to be fixed in space , while @xmath57 is free to move along @xmath61 .",
    "we assume the axes to have a fixed relative rotation @xmath62 , i.e. , @xmath63 .",
    "the rod is free to hinge about and slide along both @xmath57 and @xmath59 . for definiteness",
    "we assume that the rod is mounted in such a way that both axes @xmath57 and @xmath59 are directed along the vector @xmath7 in the rod s cross - section .",
    "this situation is described by the following boundary conditions : @xmath64    at @xmath58 , and @xmath65 at @xmath60 , where the position vector has been decomposed as @xmath66 and @xmath67 is an applied end force ( positive for tension ) .",
    "conditions ( [ eq : bc41 ] ) and ( [ eq : bc46 ] ) restrict the movement of the ends of the rod to the planes spanned by @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively . to these 12 conditions we have to add conditions that ensure the orthonormality of the director basis , for which we can take @xmath70 for a total of 18 boundary conditions , as required .",
    "we shall take @xmath71 so that the initial rod , lying straight along @xmath61 , is untwisted .",
    "this choice implies that any helical solutions will have an integer number of half helical periods . also ,",
    "the directors , and hence the cross - section of the rod , will make a half - integer number of turns between @xmath58 and @xmath72 . without loss of generality we may choose @xmath73 , so that at the ends of the initial rod the directors @xmath1 are aligned with @xmath46 .    since",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath59 are chosen aligned , there is a rigid - body degree of freedom of translation of any solution along these axes . to eliminate this degeneracy we replace condition ( [ eq : bc45 ] ) above by @xmath74 where the slide @xmath75 along @xmath59 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hel : bc ] ) is chosen as follows .",
    "first note that a helix is a curve of constant axial radius @xmath76 and ( total ) curvature @xmath77 .",

    "so , in order to ensure that any bifurcating helix is centred at @xmath61 we take @xmath83 giving a nonlinear boundary condition .",
    "note that @xmath34 can here be taken with its sign , so that ( [ eq : bc45a ] ) also specifies which way the rod moves along @xmath59 .",
    "when the rod buckles , the axis @xmath57 lifts up and the rod is free to find its own radius @xmath84 .",
    "we stress that condition ( [ eq : bc45a ] ) has no effect on the bifurcation behaviour .",
    "in particular , it does not suppress any non - helical solutions .",
    "it merely ensures that if a helical solution bifurcates it will be centred at the axis of rotation .",
    "this is important when we start rotating the axes @xmath57 and @xmath59 about @xmath61 .",
    "a centred helix will experience a uniform centrifugal force and is therefore expected to remain helical .",
    "of course the above coat hanger boundary conditions merely _ allow _ for helical solutions .",
    "they need not exist .",
    "however , if the equilibrium equations do have helical solutions and one - parameter curves of such solutions intersect the trivial path of straight solutions , then one might expect to detect them as ( pitchfork ) bifurcations at critical buckling loads .",
    "the results presented in section [ results ] show that this is indeed the case .",

    "we linearise the full pde ( [ eq : lmomentum])([eq : constitutive ] ) about these whirling solutions .",
    "we follow the approach in @xcite , which is similar to approaches in @xcite .",
    "the stability of static ( non - whirling ) solutions can be investigated by simply setting the angular velocity @xmath56 to zero .",

    "the handedness of helical solutions is determined by the sign of @xmath280 , right - handed for @xmath306 .",
    "the two solutions for @xmath307 in ( [ omega ] ) correspond to the two branches emanating from the pitchfork bifurcations , both with the same handedness but with opposite signs for both @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the buckling condition is obtained by setting @xmath287 : @xmath308 or , for @xmath71 and in dimensionless parameters , @xmath309 this expression shows that an applied tension ( @xmath310 ) and inertia ( @xmath311 ) stiffen the rod against helical buckling , while whirl ( @xmath312 ) softens it , as expected .",
    "the critical values of @xmath185 agree with the pitchfork bifurcations in figs  [ fig : hel : bif - helix ] and [ fig : hel : bif - diag - w2 ] , and with ( [ char_coat ] ) for the present case of an isotropic rod . formula ( [ buckling ] ) is of course also valid in the absence of a magnetic field ( @xmath313 ) , in which case it gives critical values for buckling due to compression ( @xmath67 ) , twist ( @xmath62 ) or whirl ( @xmath56 ) .    in the anisotropic case ( @xmath314 )",

    "we conclude that in the case @xmath71 , i.e. , in the case of parallel axes @xmath57 and @xmath59 , an anisotropic rod can not buckle into a helical solution .",
