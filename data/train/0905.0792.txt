    "many algorithms are limited by bandwidth , meaning that the memory subsystem can not provide the data as fast as the arithmetic core could process it .",
    "one solution to this problem is to introduce multi - level memory hierarchies with low - latency and high - bandwidth caches which exploit temporal locality in an application s data access pattern . in many scientific algorithms",
    "the bandwidth bottleneck is still severe , however .",
    "while there exist many models predicting the influence of main memory bandwidth on the performance @xcite , less is known about bandwidth - limited in - cache performance .",
    "caches are often assumed to be infinitely fast in comparison to main memory .",
    "our proposed model explains what parts contribute to the runtime of bandwidth - limited algorithms on all memory levels .",
    "we will show that meaningful predictions can only be drawn if the execution of the instruction code is taken into account .    to introduce and evaluate the model , basic building blocks of streaming algorithms ( load , store and copy operations )",
    "are analyzed and benchmarked on three x86-type test machines .",
    "in addition , as a prototype for many streaming algorithms we use the stream triad @xmath0 , which matches the performance characteristics of many real algorithms @xcite .",
    "the main routine and utility modules are implemented in c while the actual loop code uses assembly language .",
    "the runtime is measured in clock cycles using the ` rdtsc ` instruction .",
    "section [ sec : machines ] presents the microarchitectures and technical specifications of the test machines . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] the model approach is briefly described .",
    "the application of the model and according measurements can be found in sections [ sec : theory ] and [ sec : results ] .",
    "an overview of the test machines can be found in table [ tab : arch ] . as representatives of current x86 architectures",
    "we have chosen intel `` core 2 quad '' and `` core i7 '' processors , and an amd `` shanghai '' chip .",
    "the cache group structure , i.e. , which cores share caches of what size , is illustrated in figure [ fig : cache_arch ] .",
    "for detailed information about microarchitecture and cache organization , see the intel @xcite and amd @xcite optimization handbooks .",
    "although the shanghai processor used for the tests sits in a dual - socket motherboard , we restrict our analysis to a single core .    .test machine specifications .",

    "the proposed model introduces a systematic approach to understand the performance of bandwidth - limited loop kernels , especially for in - cache situations . using elementary data",
    "transfer operations we have demonstrated the basic application of the model on three modern quad - core architectures .",
    "the model explains the bandwidth results for different cache levels and shows that performance for bandwidth - limited kernels depends crucially on the runtime behavior of the instruction code in l1 cache .",
    "this work proposes a systematic approach to understand the performance of bandwidth - limited algorithms .",
    "it does not claim to give a comprehensive explanation for every aspect in the behavior of the three covered architectures .",
    "work in progress involves application of the model to more relevant algorithms like , e.g. , the jacobi or gauss - seidel smoothers .",
    "future work will include verification and refinements for the architectures under consideration .",
    "an important component is to fully extend it to multi - threaded applications .",
    "another possible application of the model is to quantitatively measure the influence of hardware prefetchers by selectively disabling them .",
