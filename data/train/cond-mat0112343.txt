    "the determination of the ground state of the cuprate superconductors as a function of the hole density has been one of the central problems in condensed matter physics in the last decade . at zero hole density",
    ", it is well established that the ground state is a mott insulator with long range magnetic nel order . at moderate hole density",
    ", it is also widely accepted that the ground state is a @xmath1-wave superconductor , all of whose important qualitative properties are identical those of the standard bcs - bdg theory . at issue are the ground states which interpolate between these well understood limits , and the manner in which they influence the anomalous properties at temperatures ( @xmath2 ) above @xmath3 ( the critical temperature for the onset of superconductivity ) .",
    "while a plethora of interesting proposals for these intermediate states have been made , we will focus here on ( in our view ) the simplest possibility : the order parameters characterizing the intermediate ground states are simply those of spin and charge density waves ( sdw and cdw ) , and superconductivity ( sc ) itself . apart from a small range at very low doping , which shall not be of interest in this paper , we know from neutron scattering experiments that there is sdw order collinearly polarized at the wavevectors @xmath4 where @xmath5 is square lattice spacing , and",
    "the wavevector shift from two sublattice order , @xmath6 , is a function of the doping concentration . in particular ,",
    "strong motivation for our study here was provided by the remarkable experiments of wakimoto _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "they showed that the onset of superconductivity in la@xmath7sr@xmath8cuo@xmath9 occurs first at @xmath10 ( in a first - order insulator - to - superconductor transition ) into a state which also has long - range spin - density - wave order at @xmath11 with a wavevector of the form ( [ kval ] ) _ i.e. _ as @xmath12 is moved away from the insulator at @xmath13 , the first conducting state is a sc+sdw state .",
    "as the ground state for large enough @xmath12 is a sc state , it follows that there must be at least one quantum phase transition between the sc+sdw and sc states , and we will work with the simplest possibility that there is one direct transition at a critical @xmath14 .",
    "et al . _ also showed that such a transition associated with the vanishing of the sdw moment occurred for @xmath15 ( see fig 1 in ref .  ) .",
    "we shall assume that the sc+sdw to sc quantum phase transition is second - order : direct evidence for critical magnetic fluctuations in la@xmath7sr@xmath8cuo@xmath9 for @xmath16 was provided in the neutron scattering experiments of aeppli _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "we will also discuss the appearance of local and long - range cdw order in the above phases .",
    "it is important to note that , throughout this paper , we use the term `` charge density wave '' ( or `` charge order '' ) in its most general sense : such order implies that there is a periodic spatial modulation in all observables which are invariant under spin rotations and time reversal , such as the electron kinetic energy , the exchange energy , or even the electron pairing amplitude ; the modulation in the site charge density may well be unobservably small because of screening by the long - range coulomb interactions .",
    "we note that the doping dependence of the magnetic order in the cuprates can be quite complex , varies significantly between different compounds , and is influenced by the degree of disorder : the magnetic order may well be spin - glass like at the lowest energy scales at some @xmath12 .",
    "the sdw order is also enhanced in the vicinity of special commensurate values of the doping like @xmath17 ( see _ e.g. _ fig 1 in ref .  ) , along with a suppression of sc order . in general",
    ", we do not wish to enter into most of these complexities here , although we will mention ( in section  [ sec : op ] ) how our theory could be extended to explain the commensuration effects ",
    "some other relevant issues will be discussed in section  [ oldsdw ] .",
    "our primary assumption is that the low energy collective excitations can be described using the theory of the vicinity of a quantum critical point between the sc+sdw and the sc phases ; evidence supporting this assumption was also reviewed in ref .  .",
    "this critical point is present either as a function of @xmath12 in the material under consideration , or in a generalized parameter space but quite close to the physical axis .",
    "it is also important not to confuse this magnetic quantum critical point , with other proposals for quantum critical points near optimal doping that have appeared in the recent literature @xcite .",
    "these latter critical points are near @xmath18 , and are probably not associated with long - range spin density wave order at a wavevector of the form ( [ kval ] ) .",
    "this paper will discuss magnetic transitions at smaller doping .    upon accepting the existence of a second order quantum critical point at @xmath11 between the sc+sdw and sc phases ,",
    "a powerful theoretical tool for the analysis of experiments becomes available@xcite .",
    "the structure of the critical theory , and its associated classification of eigen - perturbations , allows a systematic and controlled theory of the spin excitations in the sc and sdw phases on either side of the critical point .",
    "such an approach was recently exploited to study the influence of non - magnetic zn and li impurities in the sc phase  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will use the same tools to study the influence of an applied magnetic field , oriented perpendicular to the cuo@xmath19 layers , on both the sc and the sc+sdw phases .",
    "an outline of our results has already appeared in previous communications @xcite : here we will present the full numerical solution of the our self - consistent equations for the dynamic spin spectrum in an applied field , along with a number of new results .",
    "measurements of the spin and charge correlations in the presence of such an applied magnetic field have appeared recently in a number of illuminating neutron scattering , @xcite nmr @xcite and stm experiments@xcite , and we will compare their results with our prior predictions .",
    "the field theory for a sc to sc+sdw transition in zero applied magnetic field can be expressed entirely in terms of the sdw order parameter which we will introduce in this subsection ; the quantum fluctuations of the sc order can be safely neglected , a point we will discuss further in section  [ oldsdw ] .",
    "consideration of the applied magnetic field will appear in the following subsection .",
    "we introduced above the wavevectors of the sdw ordering @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; almost all of our analysis will apply for general values of @xmath22 , but the value @xmath23 is of particular interest above a doping of about @xmath24 . to obtain an order parameter for such a sdw",

    "these fields can describe a wide variety of sdw configurations , but we now list the two important limiting cases .",
    "( _ i _ ) collinearly polarized sdws , for which @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a _",

    "now for @xmath51 , the order parameter @xmath37 belongs to the space so(3)@xmath52 ( see _ e.g. _ section 13.3.2 in ref .  ) .",
    "the experimental evidence@xcite supports the conclusion the sdw ordering in the cuprates in collinear , but the present formalism allows a common treatment of both the collinear and spiral cases .",
    "this complex - vector formulation of the sdw order allows treatment of the sdw quantum transition by a straightforward generalization of the real - vector theory used for the nel state in the insulator ; related points have been made by castro neto and hone  @xcite and zaanen  @xcite .",
    "the same approach was also used by zachar _",
    "et al._@xcite to treat the onset of sdw order at finite temperatures , as we will indicate below .",
    "along with the sdw order , cdw order may also appear .",
    "we parameterize the charge density modulation by : @xmath53 \\label{e2}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 are the cdw ordering wavevectors and @xmath55 the corresponding complex order parameters .",
    "the quantum numbers of the observable @xmath56 are identical to those of @xmath57 , and so by squaring ( [ e1 ] ) we see that associated with the sdw is a cdw with @xcite @xmath58 , @xmath59 ( modulo reciprocal lattice vectors ) , @xmath60 note that this cdw is absent for the case of a circular spiral sdw ( in which case @xmath61 ) but is necessarily present for a collinear sdw . in principle , in a state with condensates of both @xmath34 and @xmath37 , a cdw can also be present at wavevector @xmath62 ; we will not consider this possibility here as it does not seem to be experimentally relevant .",
    "as was emphasized in the third paragraph of section  [ sec : intro ] , we are using the term cdw here in its broadest sense : there is a modulation at the wavevector @xmath63 in all observables which are invariant under spin rotations and time reversal .",
    "the precise nature of the cdw order may be determined from an analysis of the stm spectrum  this has been discussed recently in refs .  .",
    "the order parameters @xmath29 , @xmath55 allow a rich variety of phases and phase transitions in the presence of background sc order .",
    "these will be discussed in some detail in section  [ newphases ] .",
    "central to a description of these phases is an understanding of the symmetries respected by any effective action for the order parameters .",
    "we describe these below and then focus on a particular phase transition of physical interest .",
    "an obvious symmetry is that under spin rotations ; this is described by the group su(2 ) , and the fields @xmath29 transform as @xmath64 vectors labeled by the index @xmath36 . in addition , there is an independent _ sliding _ symmetry @xmath65 associated with the translational symmetry of the underlying lattice model : translating @xmath27 to @xmath66 ( @xmath67 integer ) in ( [ e1 ] ) leads to ( [ sliding ] ) with @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( @xmath22 was defined in ( [ kval ] ) ) . for @xmath22 irrational",
    ", we see that all real values of @xmath70 can be generated with the different choices for @xmath67 , and hence the sliding symmetry is u(1)@xmath71u(1 ) . for rational @xmath22 , with @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , @xmath43 relatively prime integers ,",
    "only integer multiples of @xmath74 are allowed in ( [ sliding ] ) ; in this case the sliding symmetry is reduced to @xmath75 . the difference between u(1 ) and",
    "@xmath42 will not be material to any of our results for @xmath76 . in a similar manner",
    ", we can also determine the action of other elements of the square lattice space group on @xmath29 and we mention two important cases : under a spatial inversion we have @xmath77 , and under the interchange of @xmath78 and @xmath79 axes , we have @xmath80 .",
    "we now apply these symmetries to determine the effective action of a physically relevant transition discussed earlier in the introduction ( and in the phase diagrams of section  [ sec : zero ] ) : that between the sc+sdw and sc phases .",
    "this transition is driven by the condensation of @xmath29 ; if the sdw order is collinear , it will drive a concomitant cdw order , as discussed above . supplementing the symmetries by a renormalization group ( rg ) procedure which selects terms with smaller powers of @xmath29 and fewer spatial and temporal gradients ,",
    "we obtain @xcite the effective action @xmath81 . \\label{sphi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that first - order temporal gradient terms like @xmath82 are forbidden by spatial inversion symmetry@xcite . in principle , first - order spatial gradient terms like @xmath83",
    "are permitted by all symmetries ; such terms lead to a shift in the wavevector at which sdw fluctuations are largest , and we assume that they have already been absorbed by our choice of @xmath84 . here",
    "@xmath85 and @xmath86 are velocities , which are expected to be of order the spin - wave velocity , @xmath87 , of the nel state in the undoped insulator . the parameter @xmath88 tunes the system from the sc phase ( @xmath89 ) to the sc+sdw phase ( @xmath90 ) , where @xmath91 is the non - universal location of the quantum critical point between these phases ; experimentally , @xmath88 can be varied by changing the doping concentration .",
    "the action also contains a number of quartic non - linearities : the rg analysis shows that these are strongly relevant perturbations about the gaussian theory , and will play a crucial role in our analysis below .",
    "the coupling @xmath92 selects between the collinear and spiral sdw states : for @xmath93 , the circular spiral state ( which has @xmath94 ) is selected , while @xmath95 prefers a collinear sdw .",
    "the couplings @xmath96 lead to correlations between the orders at @xmath20 and @xmath21if these are attractive , the @xmath90 phase will have simultaneous orderings at both wavevectors , and spatial pattern will have a checkerboard structure .",
    "we have also neglected the couplings to the low energy nodal quasiparticles , which are additional excitations of the sc phase carrying spin ; their effects are suppressed by the constraints of momentum conservation , as they can damp the @xmath97 quanta effectively only if @xmath98 equal the separation between any two nodal points .",
    "the case where this nesting condition is satisfied has been considered earlier @xcite , but we will not enter into it here for simplicity : essentially all of our results here on the phase diagram in an applied magnetic field apply also to the case where the nesting condition is obeyed . for completeness , in appendix [ dzyaloshinskii - moriya ]",
    "we also discuss the role of spin symmetry breaking dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction present in la@xmath7sr@xmath99cuo@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we show that it helps stabilize collinear sdw order in a certain direction ; however its effect is very small and will be neglected in the rest of this paper .    for the particular rational value @xmath100 , the u(1)@xmath71u(1 ) sliding symmetry",
    "is reduced to a discrete @xmath101 symmetry under which @xmath70 in ( [ sliding ] ) are only allowed to be multiples of @xmath102 .",
    "this reduced symmetry allows additional terms in ( [ sphi ] ) whose structure has been discussed earlier@xcite .",
    "such terms help choose between site- and bond - centered density waves@xcite , and could also lead to the enhancement of the moment observed by wakimoto _",
    "@xcite near @xmath103 . however , these terms are very high order ( eighth ) in the @xmath97 fields , and consequently they have a negligible effect on the issues we are interested in here : so we will not consider them further .",
    "it is useful to compare our treatment here of the sc+sdw to sc transition with others in the literature .",
    "it is essential for our purposes that the spin / charge ordering is taking place in a background of sc order , as that gaps out the fermionic excitations except possibly at special points in the brillouin zone .",
    "theories@xcite which consider sdw / cdw order in a fermi liquid have additional damping terms in their effective action which change the universality class of the transition , change the dynamic exponent to @xmath104 , and do not obey strong hyperscaling properties as the quartic couplings are marginally _ irrelevant _ in this case .",
    "we have also taken a genuinely two - dimensional view on the sdw / cdw ( `` stripe '' ) fluctuations in our approach .",
    "an alternative approach@xcite assumes there are intermediate scales on which the physics of the one - dimensional electron gas applies , although a crossover to similar two - dimensional physics occurs on large enough scales@xcite .",
    "an applied magnetic field has a zeeman coupling to the spin of the electrons , and this is present for any direction of the applied field .",
    "however , the zeeman splitting of the magnetic levels has only a minor effect , and can be safely neglected compared to the much stronger effects near @xmath91 that we consider below .",
    "we discuss the influence of the zeeman term in appendix  [ zeeman ] , and will not consider it further in this paper .",
    "the dominant effect of the field is via its coupling to the orbital motion of the electrons , which is sensitive only to the component of the field orthogonal to the layers .",
    "the reason for this strong effect is simple : there is sc order in the orbital wavefunction of the electrons , and the diamagnetic susceptibility of the sc state to the applied field is infinite .",
    "however , as the sc order is non - critical across the transition at @xmath91 , it is mainly a quiescent spectator and its response can justifiably be treated in a static , mean - field theory .",
    "consequently , we model the complex sc order parameter @xmath105 in the familiar abrikosov theory with the free energy _ per layer _",
    "( we use units with @xmath106 throughout ) @xmath107 . \\label{of}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that unlike @xmath29 , @xmath108 is not a fluctuating variable , and described completely by its mean - value ( which will be @xmath27 dependent ) .",
    "we will work entirely in the limit of extreme type - ii superconductivity ( with ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath109 ) ; so there is no screening of the magnetic field by the meissner currents , and @xmath110 , the applied , space - independent magnetic field .    to complete the description of the model studied in this paper , we now need to couple the sc and sdw order parameters together .",
    "the simplest term allowed by symmetry is a connection between the local modulus of the order parameters : @xmath111 for @xmath112 , we can induce a competition between the sc and sdw orders , in that the sdw order will be enhanced where the sc order is suppressed and vice - versa .",
    "the microscopic origin of the coupling @xmath113 is discussed in appendix  [ app : box ] .    although @xmath114 will be the primary coupling between the sdw and sc orders , an additional allowed term will be important for some purposes@xcite . to understand this , notice that all terms in @xmath115 and @xmath116 are invariant under the sliding symmetry ( [ sliding ] ) .",
    "this means that , with the present terms , the cdw order is free to slide arbitrarily with respect to any vortex lattice that may be present in the sc order @xmath108 .",
    "this clearly can not be true , as lattice scale effects should pin the two modulations with respect to each other . the simplest additional coupling which will provide this pinning",
    "can be deduced by noticing that there should be a coupling between the charge modulation in ( [ e2 ] ) and the local modulus of the superconducting order ; this is induced by the term@xcite @xmath117 . \\label{e3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that we are now performing a discrete summation over the lattice sites @xmath27 , rather than integrating over a spatial continuum : this is a direct consequence of the rapidly oscillating factors @xmath118 and @xmath119 which do not have a smooth continuum limit . indeed , in regions where @xmath120 is smoothly varying , these rapidly oscillating factor will cause the summation over @xmath27 to vanish .",
    "so the expression ( [ e3 ] ) is appreciable only over regions where @xmath120 is rapidly varying , and this happens only in the cores of the vortices",
    ". as the centers of the vortices are identified by the zeros of @xmath120 , and we are mainly interested in scales larger than vortex core size , we can replace ( [ e3 ] ) by the following expression , which is more amenable to an analysis in the continuum theory @xcite : @xmath121 . \\label{e4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the summation is over all points @xmath122 at which @xmath123 ( these are the centers of the vortices ) , and @xmath124 is a phase which depends upon the microscopic structure of the vortex core on the lattice scale .",
    "the action @xmath125 is not invariant under the sliding symmetry , and so will pin the cdw order .",
    "we are now in a position to succinctly state the field - theoretic problem which will be addressed in this paper .",
    "we are interested in the partition function for sdw / cdw fluctuations defined by @xmath126 & = & \\int { \\cal d } \\phi_{x \\alpha } ( { \\bf r } , \\tau ) { \\cal d } \\phi_{y \\alpha } ( { \\bf r } , \\tau ) \\nonumber \\\\ & ~&~\\times \\exp \\left ( - \\frac{{\\cal f}}{t } - { \\cal s}_{\\phi } - { \\cal s}_{\\phi \\psi } - { \\cal s}_{\\rm lat } \\right ) , \\label{zdef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] accompanied by the solution of @xmath127}{\\delta \\psi ( { \\bf r } ) } = 0 \\label{scdef}\\ ] ] which minimizes @xmath128 $ ] to determine the optimum @xmath120 . note the highly asymmetrical treatment of the sdw and sc orders : we include full quantum - mechanical fluctuations of the former , while the latter is static and non - fluctuating .",
    "this asymmetry is essentially imposed on us by the perspective of magnetic quantum criticality , and the fact that we are developing a theory of the sc+sdw to sc transition .",
    "this asymmetry should also be contrasted with the symmetric treatment of sc and sdw quantum fluctuations in other approaches@xcite .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to determine the phase diagram and low - energy spectrum of sdw and cdw fluctuations of @xmath129 as a function of the applied field @xmath130 .",
    "a summary of our results has already appeared@xcite and detailed numerical solutions appear in the body of the paper ; here we expand on the central physical idea to provide an intuitive understanding of our results to readers who do not wish to study the details in the remainder of the paper .",
    "we will initially ignore the pinning described by @xmath131 , but will discuss its consequences in section  [ sec : pinsc ] .",
    "let us begin in the sc phase with @xmath89 and consider the @xmath34 fluctuations in a simple gaussian theory ( the considerations of this subsection apply equally to @xmath132 , which we will not mention further ) .",

    "this localization length @xmath156 must be clearly distinguished from the spin correlation length , @xmath157 : the latter is associated with correlations between different vortices , and arises because there is an exponentially small coupling between magnetism in neighboring cores .",

    "we now argue that corrections beyond the gaussian theory approximation invalidate the above picture when @xmath148 becomes small@xcite .",
    "indeed , the picture of nearly - independent , localized magnetic excitations in each vortex core holds only then @xmath148 is of order the spin exchange energy @xmath158 ; such high energy magnetic excitations are expected to strongly damped by the fermionic quasiparticles .",
    "also , the validity of the present continuum model is questionable at scales as short as vortex core size and at energies of order @xmath158 : a full solution of the bcs theory of the underlying electrons is surely needed , and subsidiary order parameters may well develop within the vortex cores .",
    "however , as @xmath148 is lowered , we will now argue that the physics is actually dominated by the large region outside the vortex cores , where the present continuum approach can be used without fear , and the subtle issues of the short - distance physics within the core can be sidestepped .",
    "the central weakness in the analysis of the previous paragraph is that it does not account for the repulsive interactions @xmath159 between the bosonic @xmath34 exciton modes that are condensing .",
    "as has been discussed in different contexts long ago @xcite , such interactions are crucial in determining the structure of the lowest energy state in which condensation occurs .",
    "in particular , it is well known that the effect of interactions is to delocalize the lowest energy states : bosons initially prefer to occupy strongly localized , low energy states , but then their repulsive interaction with subsequent bosons drives the energy of such states up .",

    ", we need to replace ( [ v0 ] ) by @xmath160 the additional terms arise from a hartree - fock decoupling of the quartic interaction terms in @xmath115 , and the expectation values have to be evaluated self - consistently under the gaussian action in ( [ sg ] ) which itself depends upon @xmath161 .",
    "note that the perspective of magnetic criticality requires that we account for the @xmath159 interactions , as these are strongly relevant perturbations about the gaussian theory ; so we are led to ( [ v ] ) also by a naive application of the rg approach .",

    "one of our central points here is that while the vortex core correlations may well be quite complicated ( they are dependent on lattice scale effects , and difficult to distinguish from each other as the short - distance ` order ' fluctuates dynamically ) , these issues can be sidestepped : a reliable continuum theory can be developed by considering first the dominant effects arising from the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism in the superflow region outside the vortex cores .",
    "spin density wave correlations induced in these regions may leak into the vortex cores , but our treatment is not expected to be reliable in the latter region : the nature of the electronic correlations in the vortex cores remains an open question .",
    "our continuum treatment of dynamic and static spin density wave order differs from earlier works in several key aspects .",
    "an important feature of refs .",
    "is the static mean - field treatment of the sdw order in the vortex cores , which is imposed by their `` so(5 ) '' picture of sc order outside the cores ` rotating ' into static antiferromagnetism in the cores@xcite .",
    "this should be contrasted to our approach , in which magnetic quantum criticality implies dynamic magnetic fluctuations while the sc order can be safely considered static .",
    "further , refs .   assumed the ( near ) equality of the gradient and `` mass '' terms for the sc and two - sublattice sdw order parameters , as naturally suggested by the dynamic so(5 ) symmetry , which requires a symmetry between the excited states in the sc and sdw phases . as a result they found static two - sublattice magnetization induced by the vortex core , over a scale which was of order the vortex core size , @xmath182 , and in a regime where",
    "superconductivity was essentially completely suppressed .",
    "this assumption was relaxed in a recent paper @xcite , where following our work @xcite , the possibility of a generalized dynamic sdw in regions larger than the non - superconducting core , and co - existing with well - established superconductivity , was appreciated .",
    "hu and zhang@xcite also suggested that a small proximity - type coupling between the magnetic domains centered on the neighboring vortices may be sufficient to stabilize static long - range magnetic order in a sc+sdw phase , in which enhancement of the sdw in the vortex cores was the dominant effect . as we have reviewed at length above , the strongly relevant exciton self - interactions lead to a different description of the sc+sdw phase@xcite ; in the sc phase , as one approaches the sc+sdw phase , the sdw order is induced over large length scales outside the vortex core , and the influence of the superflow is paramount . only in the regime where magnetic field is small and",
    "the system is well within the sc phase ( and far from the sc to sc+sdw boundary ) , can we speak in terms of localized bound state pulled below the continuum .",
    "however , this limit is of little experimental interest , since it corresponds to high energy magnetic excitons ( which , as discussed above , are probably strongly overdamped by other excitations associated with the vortex cores ) with a vanishingly small intensity .",

    ", the physics of the doped mott insulator induces a preference for excitonic sdw fluctuations at the wavevectors @xmath98 and for cdw fluctuations at the wavevectors @xmath207 .",
    "the sc phase has a spin gap , @xmath148 , at these wavevectors , and so such spin correlations decay exponentially on the scale @xmath208 ( as we have noted , this is not a localization scale of the spin exciton states , which are all extended )",
    ". the vortex core pins the phase the dynamic sdw fluctuations which reside above this spin - gap , and the resulting `` friedel oscillations of the spin - gap '' are manifested by static cdw oscillations at the wavevectors @xmath54 whose envelope decays exponentially over a length scale @xmath209 .",
    "these may therefore be viewed as the friedel oscillations associated with the excitonic bound states that are present below the particle - hole continuum of the @xmath1-wave superconductor . in a weak - coupling bcs / rpa theory one can also expect additional friedel oscillations associated with the continuum of particle - hole excitations , whose wavevector is determined by the quasiparticle dispersion",
    ". such a picture may be appropriate in the strongly overdoped limit in zero magnetic field , with pinning provided by impurities .",
    "however , as one lowers the doping in the sc phase ( to approach the boundary to the sc+sdw phase ) , an excitonic bound state appears , and we have focused on its physics here ; the wavevector of this exciton is determined by strong - coupling effects in the doped mott insulator . the strength of this exciton could also be enhanced relative to the particle - hole continuum in the vicinity of vortices in an applied magnetic field  this effect requires explicit consideration of the fermionic quasiparticles , and so is beyond the scope of the theories considered here .",
    "the outline of the remainder of this paper is as follows .",
    "we will begin in section  [ sec : zero ] by a discussion of the phase diagram of the spin and charge density wave order parameters in zero magnetic field .",

    "section  [ sec : pd ] contains a description of the phase diagram in the magnetic field , while the subsequent sections describe the dynamic and static properties of the two phases on either side of the critical point in some detail : section  [ sc ] describes the sc phase , while section  [ sc+sdw ] describes the sc+sdw phase .",
    "section  [ oldsdw ] reviews earlier theoretical and experimental work on the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity , and discuss its relationship to our treatment here .",

    "we orient ourselves by discussing the phase diagrams of models with various types of spin and charge density wave order .",
    "we will restrict our attention in this section to zero external field , assume that a background sc order is always present in all the phases .",
    "as we have argued above , this implies that we need not consider the sc order parameter explicitly , and its influence only serves to renormalize various couplings in the effective actions .",
    "a somewhat different viewpoint , with a more explicit role for the sc order , has been taken recently by lee@xcite .    here , we consider phases that are characterized simply by the condensates of one or more of the order parameters @xmath29 and @xmath55 , introduced in section  [ sec : op ] .",

    "lattice scale theories@xcite of charge order in superconductors with preserved spin rotation invariance also found a substantial doping range of bond - centered charge order with a period of four lattice spacings , as did density matrix renormalization group studies@xcite .",
    "the spatial extent of the envelope of this charge order in the sc phase has been computed in the present paper : the length scale in the observations is quite similar to that in our computations in figs  [ figcdw02 ] and  [ figcdw05 ] .",
    "these computations were carried out for the _ same _ set of parameters ( only the value of @xmath267 was changed to tune the doping level ) used to obtain general quantitative consistency with the neutron scattering experiments above .",
    "the data of hoffman _",
    "_ seems rather similar to the result for @xmath369 at point @xmath360 in fig  [ figcdw05 ] , and the location of this point in the phase diagram of fig  [ figam ] is very reasonable , given the optimal doping of their sample and of their @xmath130 value .",
    "this agreement suggests to us that the system studied by hoffman _",
    "_ has dynamic spin excitons , above a spin gap , which extend throughout the vortex lattice , as in figs  [ figcdw02 ] and  [ figcdw05 ] ; the charge order is then a signal of the pinning of these excitons by terms like those in @xmath131 .",
    "an alternative model , in which the spin order was confined only to the region where charge order has been observed in stm , would have difficulty explaining the neutron scattering experiments : spin order so confined should yield easily observable satellite elastic bragg peaks at the wavevectors of the reciprocal of the vortex lattice .",
    "our computations also offer explanations for other features of the stm data which would be difficult to understand in terms of charge order nucleated independently in each vortex core : there is a noticeable correlation between the phase and orientation of the charge order between different vortices , which extends across the entire experimental sample .",
    "we believe this correlation is induced by the extended spin exciton states above the spin gap .",
    "our model for the stm experiments can therefore be summarized as follows : the superflow in the vortex lattice reduces the energy of extended spin exciton states , and the sliding degree of freedom associated with spin density is then pinned by the vortex cores ; this results in static cdw around each vortex , but the sdw order remains dynamic and gapped .",
    "a particular strength of our model is that it consistently explains the stm and neutron scattering experiments using the same set of parameters .    for the future",
    ", our theory suggests that neutron scattering and stm studies of sdw / cdw order should be carried out in systems where a uniform superflow has been induced directly by a current source , with no magnetic field penetrating the sample .",
    "this will eliminate the vortex cores , but the superflow should still enhance the tendency for sdw / cdw order .",
    "charge order can be pinned near impurities / defects of various kinds ( _ e.g. _ dislocations , grain boundaries , surfaces ) , and so become visible to stm .",
    "we briefly comment on the high field phases ( sdw and `` normal '' ) in fig  [ figpd ] , in which superconductivity is destroyed by the magnetic field .",
    "this regime may be of relevance to the experiments of boebinger _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "dynamic fluctuations of the superconducting order surely become important as we approach these phases , and so the theory of the present paper is not complete .",
    "nevertheless , given the nucleation of charge order near the vortex cores in the sc phase ( and its observation in the stm experiments@xcite ) , it is natural to presume that this charge order survives into the `` normal '' phase .",
    "the transport properties of the non - superconducting phases remain a very interesting topic for future research , but our naive expectation is that they are insulators .",
    "another interesting type of experiments on superconductors in the vortex state has been performed recently by curro _",
    "et.al._@xcite and mitrovi _ et.al._@xcite .",
    "they measured the local field dependence of the @xmath546o spin - lattice relaxation rate ( @xmath547 ) and spin - echo decay rate ( @xmath548 ) , this allowed them to deduce the rates as a function of position in the vortex lattice .",
    "below we suggest how these experiments can be interpreted in our picture of the mixed state of the cuprates . the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath547 measures the rate at which nuclear spins are overturned as a result of interaction with electron spins . in the bcs picture of vortices in a @xmath1-wave superconductor@xcite , this quantity is proportional to @xmath549 and therefore increases dramatically close to the vortex cores due to suppression in the superconducting gap . on the other hand ,",
    "as discussed in detail earlier in this paper , for the not too overdoped cuprates , charge density waves are nucleated around the vortex cores , which should lead to a suppression in the local quasiparticle density of states , and hence @xmath547 . this effect appears to have been observed in the experiments of ref .  .",
    "another mechanism for the nuclear spin relaxation is via the collective excitations of the electron system . in particular",
    ", the excitonic sdw excitations provide a large number of low energy @xmath64 excitations for flipping the nuclear spins .",
    "we suggest that a strong increase in the the high field part of @xmath547 ( corresponding to the vortex cores ) with increasing magnetic field in the experiments of mitrovi _",
    "et.al._@xcite reflects the growth of the sdw correlations and the corresponding increase in the excitonic susceptibility .",
    "it would be interesting to study this enhancement quantitatively and compare it with the @xmath550 behavior observed in neutron scattering experiments and derived theoretically in this work .",
    "we mention that the non - two - sublattice sdw makes this mechanism more effective for relaxing the @xmath546o nuclear spins , in contrast to the @xmath539 electron magnetism which leads to a magnetic field on the oxygen sites only through the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction and weak ferromagnetism .",
    "the echo decay rate @xmath548 is related to the inhomogeneity of the local magnetic fields .",
    "the appearance of the local sdw order ( or sufficiently slow fluctuations ) should therefore contribute to the increase in @xmath548 .",
    "the sdw enhancement is relatively stronger around the vortex cores , which should give rise to the enhancement in @xmath548 in this region ; this agrees with the experimental observations in ref .  .",
    "the analysis of our paper suggests that the difference in @xmath548 will not become very large upon approaching the sc to sc+sdw boundary , as the sdw excitations become extended close to this phase boundary . as the magnetic field",
    "is increased , the sdw fluctuations should become more pronounced , so we expect that @xmath548 will increase for all values of the local field .",
    "by contrast , in the bcs theory , one would expect that @xmath548 decreases with increasing magnetic field , since the field becomes more uniform .",

    "we can now integrate @xmath563 out , and find the anisotropy term for the sdw order parameter @xmath564    from ( [ dm2 ] ) we see that the dm interaction favors the collinear sdw , with direction of @xmath565 perpendicular to @xmath553 , _",
    "i.e. _ along the orthorombic @xmath566 axis ( direction of the sdw ordering is always in the cuo plane ) .",
    "we also expect that the anisotropy becomes weaker with increasing doping due to a decrease of @xmath567 .",
    "however , the typical scale for the anisotropy is small @xcite , and so we expect that the quartic @xmath568 term in ( [ sphi ] ) plays a dominant in selecting the collinear sdw at low temperatures .",
    "we note that @xmath569 is quadratic , so it will favor the collinear sdw fluctuations even above the transition temperature .",
    "this appendix briefly discusses the effect of the zeeman coupling to the magnetic field on the action @xmath115 in ( [ sphi ] ) for the sdw fluctuations .",
    "we will see that the effects are weaker than those considered in the body of the paper , especially near the critical point a at @xmath91 in zero field ( see fig  [ figpd ] ) .    as reviewed in ref .",
    ", in systems without an overdamped particle - hole continuum of spin excitations ( as is the case here hear the ordering momenta @xmath98 ) , we can deduce the coupling to the external field using simple gauge invariance arguments .",
    "in particular , the primary consequence of the external field is to rotate the spins uniformly about the field axis , and this can be accounted for by the following replacement to all temporal gradient terms : @xmath570 and similarly for @xmath37 .",
    "here @xmath571 is the three vector in spin space representing the external field .",
    "the resulting @xmath115 is closely related to models that have been studied in some detail @xcite in the context of double layer quantum hall systems . from this work",
    ", we can deduce the phase diagram sketched in fig  [ figzeeman ] .     in ( [ sphi ] ) including the zeeman coupling in ( [ rotate ] ) .",
    "the point a is the same as the corresponding point in fig  [ figpd ] .",
    "the central argument of appendix  [ zeeman ] is that it requires a much larger field for @xmath572 near a to induce sdw order above , than in fig  [ figpd].,width=278 ]    the most important property of this phase diagram is that zero field phase transition at @xmath91 moves to finite field as @xmath573 where the exponent @xmath574 in mean - field theory .",
    "fluctuation corrections will slightly increase this value , but the present critical field will nevertheless remain _ larger _ than the field in ( [ amlog ] ) associated with the corrections arising from the superflow . in particular , the phase boundary in fig  [ figzeeman ] approaches the @xmath180 line with an infinite slope .",
    "consequently , the zeeman shift is subdominant to the stronger effects discussed in the body of the paper .",
    "in this appendix we discuss the microscopic origin of the effective interaction @xmath113 between the sc and sdw order parameters in ( [ couple ] ) .",

    "we have so far examined the interplay between sc and sdw orders near the boundary of their instability to a weakly interacting fermi liquid .",
    "now let us turn to the same interplay , but in the vicinity of a mott insulator .",
    "strong interactions are required to produce the mott insulator , and so the perturbative approach of ( [ demlerweak ] ) can not be directly applied .",
    "instead , we have to turn to alternative strong coupling approaches , in which the existence of the mott insulator is built in at the outset .",
    "such approaches have been discussed recently , and these are expressed in terms of collective degrees of freedom which are natural in the vicinity of of mott insulator .",

    "all these papers find strong repulsion between magnon and hole pair states , arising from the constraint on the allowed hilbert space .",
