    "the classical homology theory in topology is a way to describe , in algebraic ways , the presence and number of holes ( of some dimension ) in the given geometric shape or even topological space .",
    "the precise definition and the foundations can be found in munkres @xcite . the simplest algebraic invariant in a given dimension is the betti number which expresses the `` number of holes '' .",
    "the computations are the simplest with the coefficients from a finite field . for our purposes we will always use the field with two elements .",
    "when the shape is a discrete collection of disjoint points , there is only 0-dimensional homology .",
    "but the points might approximate some interesting shape . for example , if the points are in the plane then they might be tracing out some circle which can be extrapolated by a person . in three dimensions",
    ", the points might be lying densely on some sphere . in these cases , the circle has non - zero 1st dimensional homology , and the sphere has non - zero 2nd dimensional homology .",
    "persistent homology is an idea that allows us to recognize these homology classes from the given set of disjoint points .",
    "the articles @xcite give good introductions to this subject .",
    "i will only illustrate how this works in the plane with illustrations called bar - codes created using the program teamplex i developed for this purpose , which extends the javaplex software library from the stanford applied topology research group .    in the following pictures",
    "one can see the fattening of the data points happening during the construction of the complex .",
    "the details of this construction are given in section .",
    "the emerging multiple intersections correspond to simplices in the complex . just for intuitive understanding",
    ", one can imagine solid disks merging together into a connected figure .",
    "the hole that you see in figures 3 and 4 represents the 1-dimensional persistent class that we will soon see in the javaplex diagram .",
    "this whole process of fleshing out the circle from the eight points is easy to see in the 2-dimensional plane .",
    "there are two levels of complications that appear in the application in this paper .",
    "even though the number of points which represent players will not increase that much , there will be at most 20 players in the data sets , the number of properties of the players will increase to 12 .",
    "this number is the number of coordinates that describe the points .",
    "so the dimension of the space will increase from 2 to 12 .",

    "<S> this paper applies the major computational tool from topological data analysis ( tda ) , persistent homology , to discover patterns in the data related to professional sports teams . </S>",
    "<S> i will use official game data from the north - american national hockey league ( nhl ) 2013 - 2014 season to discover the correlation between the composition of nhl teams with the currently preferred offensive performance markers . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , i develop and use the program teamplex ( based on the javaplex software library ) to generate the persistence bar - codes . </S>",
    "<S> teamplex is applied to players as data points in a multidimensional ( up to 12-d ) data space where each coordinate corresponds to a selected performance marker .    </S>",
    "<S> the conclusion is that team s offensive performance ( measured by the popular characteristic used in nhl called the corsi number ) correlates with two bar - code characteristics : greater _ sparsity _ reflected in the longer bars in dimension 0 and lower _ tunneling _ reflected in the low number / length of the 1-dimensional classes . </S>",
    "<S> the methodology can be used by team managers in identifying deficiencies in the present composition of the team and analyzing player trades and acquisitions . </S>",
    "<S> we give an example of a proposed trade which should improve the corsi number of the team .    </S>",
    "<S> the hockey world used to be old fashioned . </S>",
    "<S> managers would recruit players strictly from what they could see with the naked eye . </S>",
    "<S> now , hockey analytics is becoming an influential cog in managing many nhl teams @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the toronto maple leafs have already hired an assistant manager who is a well - known proponent of data analytics @xcite . in the next five years </S>",
    "<S> , every team is predicted to have at least one `` stat analysis guru '' working with them . unlike baseball , where it is easy to have solid position - specific stats , hockey is a faster and more fluid game . </S>",
    "<S> hockey positions are much more dynamic and fluid , they are better described as roles that the players play . </S>",
    "<S> these are shifting roles between players , especially for forwards . </S>",
    "<S> the nhl keeps track of puck possession , turnovers for and against , hits for and against , shots blocked for and against , face - offs won , and scoring opportunities . </S>",
    "<S> all of that in addition to some standard stats that are easy to record such as shots on goal and , of course , goals scored , goals saved , scores of games , etc . </S>",
    "<S> the dallas stars general manager , jim nill , uses a computer program from the work of 100 college students to measure corsi numbers , turnovers , and scoring opportunities to generate statistical data for his team @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sheer size of the data available is impressive , as can be viewed at the hockey analytics website ` extraskater.com ` . </S>",
    "<S> even more data is publicly available on the official nhl website ` nhl.com ` .    </S>",
    "<S> it is very unclear how to assemble this information into good use . only recording player stats </S>",
    "<S> does not give the manager the tools to assemble an effective team . </S>",
    "<S> the next step should be the development of tools to analyze this data . </S>",
    "<S> topology is a proper tool for taking information about individual players and generating conclusions about the team . </S>",
    "<S> this is known as a local - to - global transition . </S>",
    "<S> this is where the topological data analysis ( tda ) could be useful . </S>",
    "<S> this paper seems to be the first attempt to apply the major computational tool from tda , the persistent homology , to the data collected by the nhl . </S>"
