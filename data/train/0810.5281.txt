    "even a very brief review of connections between the cosmic ray ( cr ) physics and physics of high energy interactions has to start from the origin of the high energy physics ( hep ) which has taken place high in the atmosphere where the multiparticle production processes involving cr particles have been seen in nuclear emulsions .",
    "the second important conjunction point is associated with the first and simplest statistical model describing statistically these phenomena proposed by fermi which was falsified also in the emulsion balloon experiments showing the asymmetry known today as the jet structure .",
    "then , for some time , it was believed that the pre - isr ( intersecting storage rings ) hep has reached an asymptotia and nothing unexpected appear when the energy rise .",
    "the cross sections were looking stable , according to the theory , as well as average transverse momenta , which were close to the hagedorn limit of the highest ever possible temperature @xcite .",
    "however , even in this pacific time of the end of 60 there were suppositions , experimental indications ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) from cosmic ray physics where the energies were orders of magnitude higher than available for accelerator hep that the extensive air showers ( eas ) do not look like they should , if nothing unexpected appears there .",
    "this suspicions were undoubtedly confirmed by isr .",
    "the cross sections started to increase , the transverse momenta distributions rise tails showing  just unexpected .",
    "the isr revolution initiated , to some extent , by the cr discoveries , drove to a fall of the thermodynamic , hagedorn interaction picture ( not entirely of course ) and an ascent of the parton / quark hadronization related to the name of feynman @xcite .",
    "the feynman scaling worked well and the quark hadronization picture , beautiful and simple satisfying everyone  almost everyone .",
    "the debate concerning the feynman scaling ( in the forward region ) initiated again in the cosmic ray community was resolved ( with the certainty possible in colliding experiment when the very forward region is unseen ) by the next machine , the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) .",
    "this happened about the a quarter of century ago , just around the time when there was the european cosmic ray symposium in kosice for the first time .",
    "these four facts are of course a subjective choice , but , i think , that they ought to find considerable places in any list of the interaction points between the cr and he physics .",
    "the first remark i would like to underline in this introduction is : the long time has been passed since last event on the list .",
    "the second point is related to attempt to answer the question , why this is so .",
    "is it true that cr physics really has no discovery potential for contemporary hep ?",
    "the wishful answer is , of course , `` not ! ''    in this paper we would like not only to diagnose the situation and propose the treatment , but also to show an example of the effect of such therapy .",
    "we will show the prediction to be tested in the future ( not so very far future , indeed ) related to discoveries recently announced by the pierre auger observatory @xcite and hires @xcite .",
    "the last decade of the previous century , was very successful in the particle physics , mainly in the theory . in the field of cosmic rays",
    "the attempt was made to answer one of the most important questions : about the nature of the knee in the cr energy spectrum .",
    "the question was stated precisely in kernforschungszentrum karlsruhe and to answer it the construction of the new , powerful array which could be able to simultaneously measure as many shower characteristics as possible seems to be necessary .",
    "all particle components : electromagnetic , penetrating and hadronic carry the information needed to find the cr composition on the event - by - event basis .",
    "the array kascade ( karlsruhe shower and core array detector ) started to produce physical results in late 90 .",
    "apart from experimental results there was another great achievement of the karlsruhe group  the shower simulation program corsika ( cosmic ray simulations for kascade ) @xcite .",
    "the importance of the corsika code was not only in its detailedness , exactness and completeness , but mostly in that that it was made widely available , user - friendly and clearly documented .",
    "the helpful assistance , extensive debugging with continuous significant improvements of physics involved , made the corsika a kind of a standard tool to be used by different experimental groups and theoreticians to explore and compare results on cosmic rays also in the energy regions far from initially imposed , the knee region around @xmath0@xmath1 ev .",
    "these energies are not only of special interest for studies of the acceleration / confinement of cr in the galaxy , but it also coincide , almost , with the highest accelerator energies available at that time . the high - energy interaction models which are essential for the eas development were tested and adjusted to the sps and tevatron data",
    ".    originally corsika consists of only one high - energy interaction model , the dual parton picture inspired model of capdevielle , hdpm @xcite",
    ". then other models available on the marked were build - in to the corsika structure as an options to be chosen by the user , simply by switching an appropriate flag in the steering cards .",
    "the history of major improvements is listed below .",

    "the result 102.5 mb is excluded by the most later fits",
    ". however , it should be underline here again that this result was obtained by the exact glauber formulas while the  108 mb prediction is influenced by the eas data obtained using the transition from @xmath3-air to @xmath2 made with the help of point nucleon approximation or even with multiple scattering approach @xcite .",
    "as if is shown in fig .",
    "6 ( left ) the pure proton flux around the ankle is excluded when hdpm with default parameters is used .",
    "the analytic shower development allows us to test if the correction factor of the form of eq.([corrfac ] ) applied to a model parameter can make the pure proton hypothesis acceptable .",
    "we can try first to change the interaction cross section .",
    "it is possible to get some nice result as it is seen in fig .",
    "10 .    but",
    "this results needs cross section as the one shown in the small inserted plot in fig .",
    "10 what is certainly unacceptable .",
    "applying the correction given by eq.([corrfac ] ) ( with @xmath5 not greater than @xmath6 ) to the width of the gaussian ( fig .",
    "[ hdpmpars ] ) , the average multiplicities ( taking care not to exceed the available energy , inelasticity coefficient can not be bigger than 1 ) , or to average @xmath7 the pure proton @xmath4 can not get close to the measured values .",
    "concluding : there is no way to adjust the hdpm parameters in the way that the position of the shower maximum agree with measurements for pure proton composition at and above the ankle .",
    "the situation for the wdowczyk and wolfendale model is different .",
    "the proposed strong violation of the feynman scaling came as a result of analysing the variety of cosmic ray data rather than some suggestions from simplified theoretical picture of jet fragmentation where the theory ( qcd - like ) has still problems with calculating non - perturbative effects .",
    "results shown in fig.6 give a hope that the ww parametrization could be able to describe the position of the shower maximum at very high energies with pure proton primary spectrum .",
    "the important question here is if the eventually adjusted parameters will give an acceptable characteristics for the single @xmath2 interaction .    with the help of the fast analytic program the proposed changes to the average @xmath7 ,",
    "multiplicity and inelasticity has been tested , but the main interest was put to the value of the ww model parameter @xmath8 .",
    "fig.6 shows results for @xmath9=0.105 . in fig.11 results for @xmath10 ( feynman scaling ) and @xmath11 .",
    "values of @xmath4 for feynman scaling are much to deep in the atmosphere , and looking into detail of the average multiplicity of produced secondaries ( shown in fig . 11 as inserted small plots ) one can find that they are far too small in comparison with any expectations .",
    "result of wdowczyk and wolfendale model for pure protons. the inserted plot shows the value of the model parameter @xmath9 .",
    "[ xmaxok],title=\"fig:\",width=291 ]   result of wdowczyk and wolfendale model for pure protons. the inserted plot shows the value of the model parameter @xmath9 .",
    "[ xmaxok],title=\"fig:\",width=117 ]    the constant @xmath9=0.07 works better for @xmath4 but an improvement can be obtained with a changes of the average multiplicities according to the form of eq.([corrfac ] ) .",
    "however , the multiplicities can not be upraised much without a change of secondary particles energy distribution because the limited energy available .",
    "the inelasticity calculated by dividing the integrated secondaries energies by the incoming energy can reach at most 1 ( the elasticity defined as the fraction energy carried of the most energetic particle is of course smaller than 1 ) .",
    "such a limit was applied in the analytic integration program , and in this particular case @xmath12 saturates at @xmath13ev        much better results can be achieved allowing the slow increase of the alpha from 0.07 at @xmath0ev to @xmath14 at @xmath15ev    average inelasticity and multiplicities at very high energies of such best fit of @xmath2 interaction scaling breaking are shown in fig . 13 .    the rise of @xmath9 can be translated to the behaviour of the effective ww scaling factor @xmath16 modifying the inclusive @xmath17 distributions .",
    "this is shown in fig.[wwmod ] .",
    "it eventually goes like the factor of 0.13 found in original wdowczyk and wolfendale fits from more than a quarter of century ago .     of the fit shown in fig .",
    "[ xmaxok ] .",
    "[ wwmod],width=291 ]",
    "we have analyzed the possibility of the pure proton composition of ultra high energy cr proposed recently by the pao and hires experiment .",
    "this assumption contradicts the conventional wisdom on the rate of the shower development measured by different big apparatus for some time and known as the depth of the shower maximum energy dependence .",
    "the interaction models incorporated in the eas simulation code corsika all give the composition enriched by heavies with average logarithm of the mass in about the middle between proton and iron .",
    "it is clear that the pure proton composition needs a change of the interaction model to give the self - consistent picture of the nature of the cr flux .",
    "the way of the changes has been shown .",
    "there is necessary to violate the feynman scaling very strongly .",
    "we have found that the scaling breaking model of wdowczyk and wolfendale is well suited to study this .",
    "the ww model parameter @xmath9 which describes the @xmath4 pao data with the pure proton cr is close to the value found about a quarter of century ago by wdowczyk and wolfendale in the original papers .",
    "the spread of data points and reported error bars with possible systematics do not allow us to perform fits much more precise that the one presented in this paper .",
    "it can be said that the total multiplicities could be slightly below expectations , but this is related mostly to the central rapidity region and the ww model is not supposed to specify just this region exactly .",
    "the average inelasticity could be assumed constant , but even slight decrease is possible .",
    "we have shown also that there is no way to find out the modification of dual parton inspired models ( like hdpm ) to be adjusted to the pure proton flux and @xmath4 as measured for giant eas . if one wants to have protons only than for the interpretation of the shower data , energy calibration etc .",
    "another interaction model has to be introduced to the corsika repository .",
