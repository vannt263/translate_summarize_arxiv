    "for instance if @xmath2 is the coadjoint orbit of a compact lie group , the computation of the @xmath31 s is an important open problem in the theory of the schubert calculus and is the focus of a lot of recent activity .",

    ". we will assume the action of @xmath4 on @xmath2 can be extended to a hamiltonian action of a torus , @xmath0 , of dimension @xmath33 , and replace the @xmath34 s in by their equivariant counterparts .",
    "these equivariant thom classes generate @xmath35 as a module over the ring , @xmath36 , so one gets as above an identity @xmath37 but now the @xmath31 s are elements of the polynomial ring , @xmath10 .",

    "thus , they are in principle a much larger list of unknown quantities",
    ". we will show , however , that they are in some sense , easier to compute due to the fact that , in equivariant cohomology , one has a much richer store of intersection invariants to play around with . more explicitly if @xmath39 and @xmath40 are submanifolds of @xmath2 and @xmath41 and @xmath42 their dual thom classes , the intersection number @xmath43 is zero except when @xmath39 and @xmath40 are of complementary dimension . on the other hand",

    "moreover , by the localization theorem of atiyah - bott - berline - vergne , , is a sum of local intersection invariants @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the quotient field of @xmath10 and @xmath22 a fixed point , and each of these is itself an intersection invariant .    of particular interest for us will be certain intersection invariants of this type associated with the moment map , @xmath21 .",
    "suppose that @xmath22 and @xmath28 are critical points of @xmath21 and that there are no critical values of @xmath21 in the interval @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath47 and let @xmath48 be the symplectic reduction of @xmath2 at @xmath49 . by the marsden - weinstein theorem , @xmath50 is a symplectic orbifold , and the action of @xmath0 on @xmath2 induces an action of the group @xmath51 on @xmath50 . the reduced spaces @xmath52 and @xmath53 are @xmath0-invariant symplectic sub - orbifolds of @xmath50 and so their equivariant intersection `` number '' @xmath54 is well - defined as an element of the subring , @xmath55 , of @xmath56 .",

    "see @xcite .",
    "the intersection properties of the embedded @xmath69 s in the set can be described by an intersection graph , and a beautiful observation of goresky - kottwitz - macpherson is that one can read off the structure of the equivariant cohomology ring of @xmath2 from the `` action '' of @xmath0 on this graph .",
    "more explicitly let @xmath72 be the graph whose vertices are the fixed points of @xmath0 and whose edges , @xmath73 , are copies , @xmath74 , of the @xmath69 s in theorem  [ th:1.3 ] .",

    "these functions are defined by letting @xmath79 be the representation of @xmath0 on @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and letting @xmath82 be the representation of @xmath0 on @xmath63 .",

    "the axioms  impose , of course , some condition on this labeling .",
    "for instance is equivalent to @xmath91    now let @xmath92 be the equivariant cohomology ring of @xmath2 and @xmath93 the equivariant cohomology ring of @xmath3 . since @xmath3 is a finite disjoint union of fixed points and these fixed points are also the vertices , @xmath94 , of @xmath72 it follows that @xmath95 moreover , if @xmath96 is the inclusion , the map @xmath97 is injective , by a well - known result of kirwan .",
    "the theorem of goresky - kottwitz - macpherson which we alluded to above asserts :    [ th:1.4 ] a map @xmath98 is in the image of @xmath99 if and only if , for every edge , @xmath73 , of @xmath72 @xmath100 @xmath22 and @xmath28 being the vertices of @xmath73 and @xmath101 the annihilator of @xmath90 in @xmath102 .",
