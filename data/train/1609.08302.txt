    "the sierpinski gasket was described by w. sierpinski in 1915 , and then it became one of the typical examples of fractals .",
    "sierpinski gasket has been studied in fractal geometry for years ( see for example @xcite for more information ) .",
    "it is well known that @xmath0 is the attractor of the iterated function system @xmath1 where @xmath2        in @xcite , the authors define @xmath0 as follows : let @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",

    "for every such word , it is denoted the elementary sub - triangle of level @xmath6 with vertices @xmath9 , f@xmath10 and @xmath11 by @xmath12 .",
    "then they define the sierpinski gasket as @xmath13    as known , it can be constructed several metric structures on a set .",
    "but , a metric which is not take into consideration its internal structure is far from being applicable . for example , consider the restriction of euclidean metric to @xmath0 . according to this metric",
    ", the distance between @xmath14 and @xmath15 is @xmath16 ( see figure  [ s0 ] ) .",
    "however , there is not any path between @xmath14 and @xmath15 on @xmath0 with length @xmath16 .",
    "for this reason , this metric is not meaningful on this special set .",
    "the intrinsic metric which is obtained by taking into account the paths on the structure , eliminates this discrepancy .     with respect to the euclidean metric . ]",
    "one can define the intrinsic metric on @xmath0 such that @xmath17 for @xmath18 ( for details see @xcite ) .    in the several works ,",
    "the intrinsic metric on the sierpinski gasket was constructed and defined in different ways since there exist different ways to construct ( or define ) the sierpinski gasket ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "for example in @xcite , it is given an alternative definition of the intrinsic metric on @xmath0 as follows : let @xmath19 and let @xmath20 be two elementary sub - triangles of level @xmath6 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 for all @xmath23 . for every @xmath23 , the left lower vertices of @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",

    "r. strichartz also defines the intrinsic metric in a different way by using barycentric coordinates ( for details see @xcite ) .    in @xcite ,",
    "romik tackle the discrete sierpinski gasket and define the metric giving the shortest distance on the points of this set using by the code spaces .",
    "romik then compute the average distance between points on the sierpinski gasket using the connection between the tower of hanoi problem and the discrete sierpinski gasket .    in this paper , we use code representations of the points of the sierpinski gasket to define the intrinsic metric .",

    "we give an explicit formula for the intrinsic metric on @xmath0 such that the formula does not depend on the choice of the representations of the junction points as mentioned in proposition  [ temsilcidenbagimsiz ] .",
