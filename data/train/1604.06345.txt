    "in previous work we developed a new formalism for constructing cosmological models with a periodic lattice structure @xcite .",
    "this was done by taking regions of space - time that we described using the post - newtonian perturbative expansion , and patching them together at reflection symmetric boundaries to form a global solution to einstein s equations .",
    "the advantages of this approach are ( i ) that it allows extremely large density contrasts to be consistently included in cosmology , at higher orders in perturbation theory , without the imposition of any continuous symmetries ( i.e. killing vectors ) , and ( ii ) that it allows the cosmological expansion to be viewed as an emergent phenomenon , resulting from the junction conditions between patches @xcite , rather than being specified from the outset .",
    "these two features , taken together , make our lattice models ideally suited for studying the effects that non - linear structure has on the large - scale expansion of space .",
    "such effects , usually referred to as  back - reaction \" in the cosmology literature @xcite , are important to understand if we are to have faith that the homogeneous and isotropic friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) models are suitable for interpreting observations in a lumpy universe ( such as the one within which we live ) .",
    "they may also be important for the much heralded era of  precision cosmology \" @xcite , especially if observations become good enough to isolate higher - order relativistic effects .",
    "however , while they may constitute interesting devices for studying back - reaction , and while they can help to illustrate the complementary nature of cosmology and weak - field gravity , the lattice models constructed in @xcite are not fully realistic .",
    "one way in which this situation can be improved upon , and on which we focus in this paper , is by adding other types of matter fields , beyond the non - relativistic matter that is usually included in studies of post - newtonian gravity . in this",
    "regard , particular matter fields that are of interest in cosmology are radiation , and the cosmological constant , @xmath0 .",
    "the former of these becomes increasingly important at early times , while the latter ( if it is non - zero ) comes to dominate the expansion at late times .    in this paper",
    "we extend the post - newtonian formalism by including the contribution of barotropic fluids with non - vanishing pressure , @xmath1 , to the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "such an approach can be used to include a fluid of radiation , with @xmath2 , or a cosmological constant , with @xmath3 .",
    "it could also be used to include a variety of other matter fields that are commonly considered in cosmology .",
    "we then use this extended formalism to model the gravitational fields that exist within each of our lattice cells , and proceed to determine ( lengthy ) general expressions for the effect that such fluids have on the large - scale expansion of space .",
    "this is done in full generality , without assuming anything about the distribution of matter within each cell .",
    "in order to develop these ideas further we then specialize the distribution of matter to a particularly simple example : a single point - like mass at the centre of each cell , in the presence of radiation and @xmath0 .",
    "globally , this corresponds to a regular array of massive particles sitting in a sea of radiation .",
    "the result of considering this specific set - up is an expression for cosmological back - reaction that takes an extremely simple form .",
    "its effect on the friedmann equation is to add an extra term , so that we have @xmath4 where the back - reaction term , @xmath5 , is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the standard cosmological density parameters for matter , radiation and spatial curvature , respectively , and where @xmath10 is the length of the edge of a cell ( see section [ results ] for details ) .",
    "it can be seen that the discretely distributed matter contributes a term that looks like radiation to the effective friedmann - like equation that governs the large - scale expansion of space , just as was found in @xcite .",
    "we find that presence of radiation , however , reduces the magnitude of this back - reaction term , while the presence of @xmath0 has no noticeable effect on it at all . as shown in @xcite , a negative value of spatial curvature increases the amplitude of the back - reaction , and a positive value decreases it .",
    "the physical set - up that we consider in the latter parts of this paper , consisting of a universe full of point sources , has received considerable attention over the past few years .",
    "this includes studies of the initial data of such models @xcite , as well as their evolution @xcite",
    ". studies of back - reaction in the presence of radiation and @xmath0 have also been performed using both perturbative methods @xcite , and by solving the full einstein equations @xcite .",
    "our work is complementary to these previous studies .",
    "it builds on them by developing and applying a versatile perturbative framework that incorporates non - linear density contrasts , while avoiding the ambiguities that can arise when averaging in general relativity .",
    "the plan for the rest of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we set out the equations that describe the geometry and dynamics of our lattice cells . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we use these equations to determine the cosmological expansion of our lattice , in the presence of an arbitrary barotropic fluid , and for any general distribution of matter . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we then look at the specific case of regularly arranged point masses in cubic cells in the presence of radiation , spatial curvature and a cosmological constant . throughout the paper we use latin letters ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , ... ) to denote space - time indices , and greek letters ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , ... ) to denote spatial indices .",
    "we reserve the first half of the capital latin alphabet ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , ... ) to denote the spatial components of tensors in the boundary of a cell , and the latter half ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , ... ) as labels to denote quantities associated with our various different matter fields .",
    "in this section we present the equations that describe the geometry within each of our lattice cells , and the dynamics of their boundaries .",
    "we begin by briefly recapping the set - up of our bottom - up approach to cosmology , before moving on to discuss how we extend the post - newtonian formalism to include a barotropic fluid , as well as non - relativistic matter . after this , we make use of reflection symmetric junction conditions to find the evolution of the boundary of every cell .",
    "altogether , this gives us just enough information to work out the expansion of each of our cells , and hence the lattice as a whole , to the first post - newtonian level of accuracy .",
    "we begin by splitting the universe into a large number of identical cells , in order to construct a periodic lattice structure .",
    "when doing this , we allow the cell shapes to be chosen as any regular convex polyhedra that tessellates a three - dimensional space that is either flat or has constant positive or negative spatial curvature .",
    "there are six such tessellations for a space of positive curvature , one for a flat space , and four for a space of negative curvature ( see table i of @xcite , and reference @xcite , for details ) .",
    "the analysis we present in this section is valid for any cell shape , and for any of these possible tessellations .",
    "let us now consider any one cell , and take , as a first approximation , the space - time within this cell to be close to minkowski space .",
    "we can then choose a cartesian set of spatial coordinates ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) , and rotate these coordinates until the vector @xmath26 is orthogonal to one of the faces ( as all cell faces are identical , it does not matter which one we choose ) .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , for the case of a dodecahedral cell .",
    "the position of every point on this cell face is then given by @xmath27 .",
    "now , as the evolution of this cell face is a @xmath28-dimensional time - like hypersurface , we can define a space - like unit vector , @xmath29 , as its normal .",
    "the leading - order contributions to the covariant components of this vector are given by @xcite @xmath30 where commas denote partial differentiation .",
    "reflection symmetry implies that junction conditions at the cell face should be invariant under the change @xmath31 , which means that the extrinsic curvature of every @xmath28-dimensional cell face must vanish .",
    "this requirement provides the information necessary for specifying the boundary conditions for the field equations within each cell , as well as for the motion of the cell face itself .",
    "the matter content and geometry within each of our cells is described using the post - newtonian perturbative expansion .",
    "this formalism , valid in the limit of weak gravitational fields and slow motions , assigns orders of smallness to quantities in the metric and the energy - momentum tensor using the parameter @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the three - velocity associated with the matter fields , and @xmath13 is the speed of light .",
    "the post - newtonian expansion also requires that time derivatives add an order of smallness , compared to space derivatives , so that @xmath34 , _ etc_.    the explicit expansion of the metric is then given by the following line element : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are perturbations to the minkowski metric , and where superscripts in brackets represent the order of smallness of a quantity .",
    "the metric has been expanded to @xmath40 in the time - time component , to @xmath41 in the time - space components , and @xmath42 in the space - space components .",
    "these are the orders of accuracy required in order to consistently write the equations of motion for time - like particles to first post - newtonian accuracy .",
    "we can similarly expand the matter fields in powers of @xmath43 .",
    "to do so , we define the energy density , @xmath16 , and isotropic pressure , @xmath44 , as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath47 is the metric of space - time , and @xmath48 is a reference four - velocity that satisfies @xmath49 .",
    "we can expand the energy density and pressure as @xmath50 and write the expanded four - velocity as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the three - velocity of the fluid we are considering , and @xmath53 .",
    "the reader may note that we have included a contribution to the pressure at @xmath42 , which is usually taken to vanish in post - newtonian gravity .",
    "we have done this in order to include barotropic fluids , which generally have the leading - order contribution to pressure at the same order as energy density . for further details of post - newtonian expansions ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the matter content of our space - time .",
    "we wish to model a universe that contains both non - relativistic matter , with @xmath54 , and a barotropic fluid , with equation of state @xmath1 . for simplicity , and as a first approximation , we will take the latter of these to be a perfect fluid that does not strongly interact with the non - relativistic matter .",
    "such a fluid could be used to model radiation ( @xmath2 ) , vacuum energy ( @xmath3 ) , or a massless scalar field ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the non - relativistic matter is intended to represent both baryonic matter and cold dark matter .",
    "we therefore write the total energy - momentum tensor for these two fluids as @xmath56 where subscripts @xmath57 and @xmath20 refer to quantities associated with the non - relativistic matter fields and the barotropic fluid , respectively . in",
    "what follows , the cosmological constant , @xmath0 , is included directly in the field equations .",
    "if we now take the reference four - vector for each of the fluids to be given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the three - velocities of our two fluids , then we can write the components of the perturbed energy - momentum tensor as @xmath61 where @xmath62 , and where @xmath63 is the rest - mass energy density of the non - relativistic matter fields , @xmath64 is their specific energy density , and @xmath65 is their pressure . similarly , @xmath66 and",
    "@xmath67 are the two lowest - order parts of the energy density of the barotropic fluid , and @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the two lowest - order contributions to its pressure .",
    "the reader may note the we have set @xmath70 for the non - relativistic matter fields , as we want this to represent dust - like sources such as galaxies and clusters .    before considering einstein s equations",
    ", we note that we can use the energy - momentum conservation equations for the non - interacting barotropic fluid to write @xmath71 this is the leading - order part of the euler equation of the barotropic fluid , and it immediately implies that both @xmath68 and @xmath72 must be functions of time only [ as @xmath1 , for this fluid ] .",
    "it also means that the leading - order part of the continuity equation for the barotropic fluid , which also follows directly from energy - momentum conservation , is given by @xmath73 this is very similar to the conservation equation for a homogeneous fluid in flrw models , and we later use it in the same way as that equation to determine the cosmological evolution .      in order to find the geometry of the space - time within each cell , and to solve for the motion of its boundary",
    ", we need to use einstein s field equations , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the ricci tensor , @xmath47 is the metric of space - time , @xmath0 is the cosmological constant , @xmath76 is newton s constant , @xmath46 is the energy - momentum tensor , and @xmath77 is its trace .    using the perturbed metric given in eq . , and the energy - momentum tensor from eq . , we can write the leading - order contributions to the @xmath78-component of einstein s equations as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the three - dimensional laplacian . here",
    "we have taken the cosmological constant @xmath0 to contribute at @xmath42 , which means we are modelling a scenario where @xmath81 .",
    "this happens on scales of about @xmath82 mpc , where the cosmological constant is comparable to the background gravitational potential .",
    "this is still well below the cosmological horizon scale , where our post - newtonian formalism is satisfied .    the solution to eq",
    "can be formally written as @xmath83 where the potentials @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are given implicitly as the solutions to @xmath88 using the symmetries of our lattice model , and the fact that @xmath68 is a function of time only , the potentials @xmath89 and @xmath87 can be written explicitly as @xmath90 solutions to eqs .",
    "( [ phim ] ) and ( [ phii ] ) can be given in terms of green s functions , as shown in @xcite .",
    "auxiliary functions of time can also be added in @xmath91 , and absorbed into the matter potential , @xmath84 .    to go further , we now need to make a gauge choice .",
    "we make the following choice at @xmath42 , so that we remain as close as possible to the standard post - newtonian gauge , @xmath92 this ensures that the metric is diagonal at @xmath42 , and there are no @xmath93 contributions to the @xmath94-component of the metric .",

    "this differs from the case of cosmological perturbation theory , where @xmath99 in the absence of anisotropic stress .    to solve for the @xmath100-component of einstein s equations , we now need to make a gauge choice at @xmath41 , which we do as follows : @xmath101 using both of our gauge conditions , eqs . and",
