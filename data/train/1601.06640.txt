    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is a renormalizable quantum field theory encoding our knowledge of the fundamental particles and their ( electroweak and strong ) interactions . despite its tremendous success to describe many phenomena with high accuracy for over 40 years including the recent experimental confirmation of the existence of its last missing piece , the higgs boson fundamental questions remain open ( such as the small higgs boson mass compared to the planck scale , dark matter , matter - antimatter asymmetry , neutrino masses , ... ) which may likely _ not _ be fully answered through the study of proton - proton collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "notwithstanding their lower center - of - mass energies , high - energy @xmath0 colliders feature several advantages in new physics studies compared to hadronic machines , such as direct model - independent searches of new particles coupling to z*/@xmath13 * with masses up to @xmath14 , and clean experimental environment with initial and final states very precisely known theoretically , ( i.e.  well understood backgrounds without `` blind spots '' of p - p searches ) .",
