    "recent advances in cold atomic gas experiments has made it possible to work with microscopic system sizes for fermionic @xcite and bosonic samples @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by application of optical lattices @xcite and use of feshbach resonances @xcite it is possible to tune both the geometry and the interaction strength of these setups .",
    "this allows the cold atom systems to address a host of interesting physical models in lower spatial dimensions that are typically not so easily accessible in other fields . in particular , when the system is squeezed down to a regime where particles effectively move along just a single spatial direction , one can hope to realize some of the exactly solvable models that are known for both few- and many - body systems in one dimension ( 1d ) @xcite . about a decade ago",
    "this hope led to the realization of the strongly repulsive ( hard - core ) bose gas @xcite in the so - called tonks - girardeau regime @xcite and later on also to the so - called super - tonks - girardeau gas @xcite which is an excited state for strong attractive interactions @xcite .",
    "more recently , the strongly repulsive and attractive regimes have been explored with few - body systems of two - component fermions @xcite and these recent experimental developments provide a major motivation for the current work .",
    "the experimental progress has generated great interest for few - body problems in one - dimensional geometries for both bosonic @xcite , fermionic @xcite , and mixed systems @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that for strong short - range repulsive interactions a 1d two - component fermi system in a harmonic trap exhibits strong magnetic correlations already at the three - body level @xcite .",
    "more generally , one finds that in the ground state of strongly interacting @xmath0 system the impurity will be mainly observed in the middle of the trap @xcite .",
    "this result can be generalized to other types of 1d confinement @xcite .",
    "this should be contrasted to two - component bosonic systems with equal strength intra- and interspecies interactions where the ground state for strong repulsion will be the one predicted by girardeau @xcite and the impurity would be essentially delocalized @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we seek further analytical and semi - analytic insights into the 1d fermionic three - body problem in a harmonic trap by constructing a class of variational wave functions for arbitrary repulsive zero - range interaction strength .",
    "relying on our knowledge developed for the weakly and strongly interacting limits we provide and study a variational wave function of the three - body problem that connects these two limits . by comparison to numerical results",
    "we show that our class of states yields an exceptionally good approximation for the low - energy part of the energy spectrum and also gives very accurate spin - resolved densities .",
    "this shows that intuitive approaches at the level of the wave function shape are effective in strongly interacting 1d few - fermion systems .",

    "@xcite . as an outlook we consider the 2 + 1 system in the case where the masses are imbalanced and find an intriguing change in the ground state structure for strong interactions which occurs for any infinitesimal difference in the masses between the two components .",
    "our results indicate that the large degeneracy of strongly interacting two - component systems is in some sense accidental and that spectrum for equal masses is in fact a special case ( although of course an extremely important one ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : system ]",
    "we introduce the system , our choice of coordinates and discuss the symmetries of our hamiltonian . in section  [ sec : limits ] we solve the problem for zero and infinite zero - range interaction strength while the variational approach to arbitrary repulsive interaction strength is discussed in section  [ sec : variation ] . in section",
    "[ sec : masses ] we provide an outlook towards the case where the two components have unequal masses by solving the general problem in the strongly interacting regime .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions and outlook .",
    "finally , we provide three appendices with technical details of important derivations discussed in the main text .",
    "in this section , we introduce the system that will be the subject for the rest of the article . the section is largely based on reference  @xcite and",
    "is mainly concerned with different coordinate systems in which the system can be described . at the end of this section",
    "we discuss the parity and permutation symmetries of the hamiltonian .",
    "consider the hamiltonian for a system of @xmath1 particles in one dimension @xmath2 consisting of a harmonic trap hamiltonian @xmath3 and an interaction term @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are correspondingly the position and momentum operators of particle @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is its mass .",
    "the first part describes @xmath1 such particles in a harmonic oscillator potential with angular frequency @xmath9 .",
    "the second part  , containing dirac s delta functions , describes a contact interaction between particles @xmath7 and @xmath10 of strength @xmath11 .",
    "in this article everywhere except section  [ sec : masses ] , we shall limit ourselves to @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "that is , we first consider a system of three particles of equal mass .",
    "we take particles 1 and 2 to be spinless ( spin - polarized ) fermions interacting with the third particle with strength @xmath15 .",
    "due to the pauli principle the wave function should vanish whenever particles 1 and 2 meet , thus the corresponding contribution from the delta function interaction should be neglected . having this in mind we assume @xmath16 to simplify notation .",
    "also , we introduce the length scale @xmath17 such that more convenient dimensionless coordinates can be defined as @xmath18 in these coordinates the hamiltonian of the three particle system becomes @xmath19 @xmath20 now we choose units such that @xmath21 , then it follows that also @xmath22 .",

    "the hamiltonian is invariant under the exchange of particles 1 and 2 .",
    "it immediately follows that @xmath69 = 0 $ ] where @xmath70 denotes the permutation operator exchanging the coordinates of particles 1 and 2 .",
    "since the transformation @xmath71 is equivalent to @xmath72 , the pauli principle is satisfied if and only if the wave function fulfills @xmath73 .",
    "one obvious consequence is that the wave function must vanish on the @xmath38-axis in figure [ fig : hypersfaerisk ] .",
    "we easily verify that @xmath74 = 0 $ ] , and that @xmath51 , @xmath75 and @xmath70 are all hermitian .",
    "therefore we may find a basis that is simultaneously described by energy , parity and permutation of particles 1 and 2 .",
    "the eigenvalues for both the parity operator and the permutation operator are @xmath76 . however , the pauli principle states that only eigenfunctions with the eigenvalue @xmath77 for @xmath70 are valid wave functions ( the eigenvalue @xmath78 is only for bosonic wave functions as discussed in refs .",
    "we say that the states with parity eigenvalue @xmath78 have even parity , and the states with @xmath77 have odd parity .",
    "thus we require @xmath79",
    "in this section , we find the exact wave functions that solve the schrdinger equation at @xmath80 and @xmath81 .      without the interaction the system can be considered as a three - dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator with hamiltonian @xmath82 .",
    "here we write down the eigenspectrum of this textbook hamiltonian using @xmath54 coordinates .",
    "if we denote an energy eigenbasis of @xmath82 in this set of coordinates by @xmath83 , we separate the center - of - mass motion and the relative motion as @xmath84 .",
    "the wave functions for the center - of - mass motion are the eigenstates of the one dimensional harmonic oscillator , i.e. @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the hermite polynomial of degree @xmath87 .",

    "however , we keep the general notation for the angular function @xmath91 .",
    "since @xmath94 have @xmath95 roots , this is the quantum number determining the number of roots in the radial @xmath96-direction and thus we refer to @xmath95 as a radial excitation quantum number .",
    "also we note that the value of @xmath97 determines the number of roots in the angular @xmath98-direction , and so we regard @xmath97 as an angular excitation quantum number .",
    "the quantum number for the center - of - mass excitation is @xmath87 .",
    "the energy corresponding to these quantum numbers is given as @xmath99      as discussed in the previous section , the center - of - mass motion is separable for all values of @xmath15 , and so we will focus on the wave function describing the relative motion . to start the discussion we first derive conditions for the wave function on the lines of interaction in figure  [ fig : hypersfaerisk ] .",
    "let @xmath100 , we then integrate the time - independent schrdinger equation , @xmath101 , in the @xmath102-neighborhood of @xmath103 and let @xmath104 : @xmath105 all other terms vanish due to the continuity of the wave function .",
    "the remaining integrals yield @xmath106 to simplify notation we define @xmath107 and write @xmath108 for the @xmath109 construction on the left hand side . then for a given value of @xmath15 , the wave function for the relative motion must fulfill the following condition @xmath110 this equation specifies the boundary condition on the wave function that arises from the interaction potential . for all @xmath111",
    "this potential is zero , and the known @xmath80 wave functions @xmath112 that are products of and solve the schrdinger equation .",
    "let us see if the factorized wave function is capable of fulfilling the boundary condition for values of @xmath15 larger than zero .",
    "the boundary condition for a wave function factorized in the radial and angular parts becomes an equation for the angular function @xmath91 : @xmath113 the left hand side depends only on @xmath97 and @xmath103 , but @xmath114 also depends on @xmath96 , _ unless _ @xmath80 .",
    "this means that @xmath96 and @xmath98 variables are coupled since @xmath114 depends on @xmath96 , and that a factorized wave function does nt generally solve the problem .    for",
    "the sake of argument , let us assume that @xmath114 is @xmath96-independent and solve the problem with this assumption .",
    "solving this new ( and much simpler ) problem will constitute a ` toy model ' for the system that will give us valuable insight into the original problem .",
    "the wave function may now be factorized with the radial part given by the laguerre polynomials .",
    "the angular part , @xmath91 , bears the requirements on the wave function from the pauli principle and parity such that @xmath115 having these symmetries in mind , it suffices to find the angular part of the wave function only on the first and second domains from figure  [ fig : hypersfaerisk ] . on these domains",

    "this figure is interpreted as the angular energy spectrum ( putting @xmath121 and neglecting the constant off - set energy ) for our nave ` toy model ' for the system , where we neglect the coupling between @xmath98 and @xmath96 for @xmath122 .",
    "generally it is _ not _ the spectrum for the initial hamiltonian , but rather some unknown toy model hamiltonian that allows factorized wave functions .",
    "it is apparent that the factorized wave function should solve the initial problem with @xmath114 dependent on @xmath96 in the non - interacting case @xmath123 .    solving eqs .",
    "and for the allowed values of @xmath97 in the non - interacting limit yields means @xmath124 is congruent to @xmath125 modulo @xmath126 . ]",
    "@xmath127\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] combined with eq .",
    "this implies that @xmath128 solving eqs .   and for the interacting case @xmath129 yields the following integer solutions : @xmath130 notice that we generally have , that even ( odd ) parity solutions have @xmath97 even ( odd ) .",
    "now , let us discuss the property of the @xmath129 solutions just obtained .",
    "regardless of parity , they are characterized by @xmath131 and seen as the horizontal lines in figure  [ fig : solvedmu_plot ] .",
    "thus they are independent of @xmath114 ( and @xmath15 ) , so these wave functions also solve the initial problem with @xmath122 .",
    "the reason for this is , that the wave function is zero on the lines of interaction @xmath132 , i.e. whenever two particles meet .",
    "this is a very important observation , because it means that @xmath133 for all values of @xmath15 .",
    "one may say , that these states never `` feel '' the interaction , and thus never need to adjust to it .",
    "for this reason , we call them the non - interacting states .",
    "we also see that at @xmath134 all other states become degenerate with these non - interacting states and hence demand the wave function to vanish whenever two particles meet .",
    "in fact , it does not surprise us , that only the wave functions that vanish on the lines of interaction are acceptable in the strongly interacting limit , since otherwise @xmath135 would diverge as @xmath136 .",
    "this has been discussed previously in the context of fermionic systems in refs .",
    "@xcite    to obtain the full set of solutions for the initial problem ( with @xmath137 ) at @xmath81 we note that the corresponding wave function should also be of factorized form .",
    "this observation follows since eq .",
    "can only be satisfied for infinite interaction if the wave function vanishes when two particles meet .",
    "the angular and radial parts becomes independent since two particles meet on a line which is solely determined by @xmath98 .",
    "the only wave functions that are factorized in @xmath96 and @xmath98 coordinates in each region of figure  [ fig : hypersfaerisk ] and vanish whenever two particles meet are the non - interacting solutions obtained above .",
    "thus , if we can construct orthogonal wave functions using these non - interacting states we actually have an analytic expression for the wave functions in the strongly interacting limit  @xcite .",
    "we take the wave functions for the non - interacting states and multiply them with a number @xmath138 in every domain i , ii and iii on figure  [ fig : hypersfaerisk ] : @xmath139 the subscript @xmath140 indicates that only these values are acceptable , while @xmath95 and @xmath87 may still be any non - negative integer .",
    "obviously , there will be the non - interacting state with the same wave function for infinite repulsion as in the @xmath80 limit , so its wave function in the strongly interacting limit must have @xmath141 , i.e. we multiply by one in every domain .",
    "we want to create orthogonal wave functions with definite parity , and ( up to some nonphysical phase factors ) this can only be done by choosing the domain coefficients as @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "wave function over the @xmath144 line .",
    "] this concludes the construction of the wave functions for the energy and parity eigenbasis in the strongly interacting limit .",
    "it is clear that the energy in the two interaction limits is given as @xmath145 with the discussed restriction @xmath146 in the strongly interacting limit .",
    "thus , the toy model spectrum depicted on figure  [ fig : solvedmu_plot ] reduces to the correct angular excitation spectrum in these limits .",
    "this suggests that the spectrum for the initial problem should look similar to the toy model spectrum , as we somehow have to connect these limits to obtain the spectrum for @xmath147 .",
    "however , bear in mind that the toy model spectrum , being a function of @xmath148 , will force us to pick a value of @xmath96 if we want to map it to a spectrum depending on @xmath15 .",
    "later , we will do this , but first we will introduce a more sophisticated way of handling the problem for intermediate values of the interaction strength .",
    "in this section we will use the factorized wave function presented in the previous section to describe the system with @xmath149 .",
    "we will calculate and discuss the energies and probability densities of the approximated wave functions .      to construct our variational wave function",
    "we make two assumptions about the system : _",
    "i ) _ the first one is about the adiabatic connection of the states between @xmath80 and @xmath81 limits where the wave functions should have factorized form as discussed above , and _",
    "ii ) _ inspired by the discussion in the previous section we assume that it is more important to describe the angular part of the wave function , since the interaction happens on @xmath150 line , so we fix the radial quantum number and find the angular part that minimizes the energy .",
    "suppose we have adiabatically evolved the system from the initial state @xmath151 at @xmath80 to the state at @xmath81 . what would the final state be ? clearly",
    ", the center - of - mass quantum number @xmath87 and the parity eigenvalue would be the same , but @xmath95 and @xmath97 are generally not good quantum numbers for intermediate values of @xmath15 and can in principle be very different in two limits .",
    "however , having in mind the toy model with constant @xmath114 from the previous section , we assume that the state evolves smoothly into the wave function which has a spatial profile as similar as possible to the profile of the initial wave function with changes happening mostly in the angular part , i.e. we assume that the final state has @xmath95 unchanged .",
    "in the same spirit we assume that @xmath97 is @xmath152 rounded up to the nearest multiple of three .",
    "these assumptions were proven numerically to be true for the lowest part of the energy spectrum , as we will see later in this report . to demonstrate this adiabatic connection we show the angular functions , @xmath91 , for the first six states in the @xmath97 spectrum in the @xmath80 limit in the upper row of figure [ fig : limits_plot ] . in the lower row",
    "we have the first six angular functions at @xmath81 constructed from the @xmath80 angular functions by using the domain coefficients discussed above .",
    "the functions are labeled @xmath153 , where @xmath152 is a label to keep track of the states as there are three different states for every allowed value of @xmath97 at @xmath81 , in our assumption the label is the @xmath80 value for the angular excitation quantum number .",
    "note that the parity eigenvalue is given by @xmath154 .",
    "as we have already noted in the previous section , the wave function for the relative motion can in general only be of the factorized form when @xmath80 or @xmath81 .",
    "nevertheless , since we are only seeking an approximate solution to the interacting state wave functions , we assume a factorized relative wave function also for intermediate values of the interaction strength . assuming that any state is characterized by constant @xmath95 , @xmath152 and @xmath87 we denote this state by @xmath155 , where we have put an superscript ` ap ' on the state ket to indicate the approximation .",
    "we now aim to find a reasonable form for the wave function .",
    "if we consider the individual states in figure [ fig : limits_plot ] , we can qualitatively understand how the wave function behaves for @xmath147 .",
    "the wave function is forced to vanish for @xmath132 , and so we can imagine gripping these points on the @xmath80 wave function and slowly pulling them down towards zero when @xmath15 increases .",
    "pursuing this idea , we construct angular functions with this property that reduces to the angular functions characterized by @xmath152 in the limits , i.e. @xmath156 where the radial part given as in eq .   @xmath157 the true dependency on @xmath58 is unknown for any @xmath15 from the interval @xmath1580,\\infty[$ ] , but since the above functional form is correct at the boundaries of this interval , we take it as a reasonable approximation .",
    "we assume that @xmath97 is a continuous variable and a function of the interaction strength , @xmath159 .",
    "it looses its meaning as a quantum number for the intermediate values of @xmath15 , and we think of it as a variational parameter . for a given value of @xmath15 we will vary @xmath160 such that the energy matrix element with the approximated wave function is minimal .",
    "we again would like to stress the difference between the state labeling number @xmath152 and the variational parameter @xmath160 .",
    "for the ground state ( @xmath161 ) the limits are @xmath162 and @xmath163 , and for the first excited state ( @xmath164 ) , we have @xmath165 and @xmath166 . in general , a state labeled by @xmath167 has by definition @xmath168 , and @xmath169 is @xmath152 rounded up to the nearest multiple of three . with these assumptions , it can be shown ( see appendix  [ sec : angular ] ) that @xmath170       ( -1)^{\\mu_0 + 1 } \\sin\\left(\\mu\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{6}-\\phi\\right)\\right )     + \\sin\\left(\\mu\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{6}+\\phi\\right)\\right )       & \\text{in ii}\\\\[0.5em ]       ( -1)^{\\mu_0 + 1 }       \\sin\\left(\\mu\\left(\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}+\\phi\\right)\\right )       & \\text{in iii }     \\end{cases } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is an angular function with the right parity that reduces to the solutions in the limits @xmath171 and @xmath172 that we assume are adiabatically connected .",
    "it has been found by proposing a general ansatz function with the desired parity and the property that it vanishes at @xmath173 as required by the pauli principle , and at @xmath132 for @xmath174 for a few values of @xmath97 , this function is plotted in figure  [ fig : wavefunctions ] , where we clearly see the discussed behavior .    with the assertion of as the wave function for the relative motion ,",
    "the approximation for the full wave function including the center - of - mass part becomes @xmath175          the approximated interacting state wave functions and the non - interacting state wave functions form a basis in which we would like to investigate the representation of the hamiltonian .",
    "thus we calculate the matrix elements for @xmath176 in this basis .",
    "this serves two purposes : _",

    "<S> we study a three - body system with zero - range interactions in a one - dimensional harmonic trap . </S>",
    "<S> the system consists of two spin - polarized fermions and a third particle which is distinct from two others ( 2 + 1 system ) . </S>",
    "<S> first we assume that the particles have equal masses . for this case </S>",
    "<S> the system in the strongly and weakly interacting limits can be accurately described using wave function factorized in hypercylindrical coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> inspired by this result we propose an interpolation ansatz for the wave function for arbitrary repulsive zero - range interactions . by comparison to numerical calculations , we show that this interpolation scheme yields an extremely good approximation to the numerically exact solution both in terms of the energies and also in the spin - resolved densities . as an outlook </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the case of mass imbalanced systems in the strongly interacting limit . here </S>",
    "<S> we find spectra that demonstrate that the triply degenerate spectrum at infinite coupling strength of the equal mass case is in some sense a singular case as this degeneracy will be broken down to a doubly degenerate or non - degenerate ground state by any small mass imbalance . </S>"
