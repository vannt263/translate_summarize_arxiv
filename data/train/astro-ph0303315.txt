    "if they contain three or more members , the multiple stellar systems in which many stars are known to form ( abt & levy 1976 ; poveda , allen , & parrao 1982 ) can evolve chaotically ( valtonen & mikkola 1991 ) .",
    "the least massive members of the system can then suffer an ejection ( whereby they are launched on a highly elliptical  but still bound  orbit ) , or even an escape ( a situation when the stars will leave the system altogether ) .",
    "such violent events can have major implications for the subsequent stellar evolution .",
    "they can limit the accretion process that makes young stars grow and favor the production of brown dwarfs ( reipurth 2001 ; reipurth & clarke 2001 ) .",
    "this possibility , supported by detailed hydrodynamical simulations ( bate et al .",
    "2002 ) , could explain the flattening of the low - mass end of the initial mass function with respect to salpeter s original power law .",
    "here we present the first direct evidence for this mechanism using multi - epoch high angular resolution radio observations of the multiple system t tauri .",
    "t tauri has long been known to be a binary system ( dyck , simon , & zuckerman 1982 ) .",
    "the north component , t tau n , is considered the prototype for the whole class of low - mass pre - main sequence stars , and is indeed one of the best studied young stars in the sky .",
    "the southern infrared companion ( t tau s ) , located about 0.7 arcseconds ( 100 au ) to the south , is more obscured and not evident in the optical .",
    "recent infrared images of t tau s obtained by speckle holography showed that , in turn , it is composed of two stars , t tau sa and t tau sb , separated at the time of the first infrared observations ( 1997  koresko 2000 ) by a mere 50 mas ( 7 au ) .",
    "subsequent observations ( khler , kasper , & herbst 2000 ; duchne , ghez , & mccabe 2002 ) showed that the separation between sa and sb is increasing , and that sb is currently moving westward at the fairly large projected velocity of 20 km s@xmath0 .",
    "as part of an observational program devised to search for orbital motions in embedded young multiple systems , we reanalyzed archival observations of t tauri taken with the very large array of the us national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) .",
    "the eleven observations used here correspond to all the existing vla 2 cm observations obtained in the most extended configuration of the array ( a ) with an integration time larger than 1 hour ; supplemented by a deep 3.5 cm integration obtained in 1998 also in the a configuration .",
    "the latter was included to have a continuous coverage of the source approximately every three years in the last two decades .",
    "the last 2 cm observation was obtained while pie town , an additional antenna which can be connected to the vla to obtain higher resolution , was also in use .",
    "this dataset was reduced twice : once with , and once without pie town .",
    "the data were always recorded in both circular polarizations , with an effective bandwidth of 100 mhz .",
    "the sensitivity of the observations varies significantly from epoch to epoch but it is sufficient for the two components of the system ( t tau n and t tau s ) to be detected in all epochs but one ; in the 1982 data , t tau n is not detected .",
    "all observations used as phase calibrator the source 0400 + 258 , whose absolute position has been refined over the years ; the absolute registration used here corresponds to the oldest position for 0400 + 258 : @xmath2 = @xmath3 ; @xmath4 = @xmath5 .",
    "once calibrated , the interferometer visibilities were imaged using the imagr algorithm . to obtain relatively high angular resolutions , without losing much sensitivity , we used a weight intermediate between uniform and natural for all 2 cm observations",
    "; the resulting angular resolution is of the order of @xmath6 at all epochs .",
    "the 3.5 cm image was produced with uniform weighting to obtain the highest angular resolution possible ( @xmath7 @xmath8 ) .",
    "finally , the synthesized beam for the 2001 2 cm image which includes pie town is @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 ( p.a .",
    "34@xmath12 ) .",
    "t tauri is a double radio source ( schwartz , simon , & campbell 1986 , see also our fig .  1 ) , separated by about 0.7 arcsec in the north - south direction . a third radio component ( t tau r ) which was reported from longer wavelength images ( ray et al .",
    "1997 ) , is never seen in the present data .",
    "the emission observed at 2 and 3.5 cm is probably largely dominated by free - free emission from ionized winds ( phillips , lonsdale , & feigelson 1993 ) , although gyrosynchrotron emission from a magnetically active photosphere might also contribute ( skinner & brown 1994 ; johnston et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "although faint extended emission , presumably tracing episodic ejection events , is sometimes seen around t tau s , the cores of both t tau n and t tau s remain essentially gaussian at our angular resolution ( see fig .  1 for images at four of the epochs ) .",
    "this implies that extended components of the outflow powered by t tau s ( van langevelde et al .",
    "1994 ; solf & bhm 1999 ) never dominate the short wavelength radio emission and are unlikely to affect significantly our astrometry . since t tau s appears as a single source , it is _ a priori _ unclear whether both components ( t tau sa and sb ) known to exist there contribute to the total observed emission , or whether one of the two components strongly dominates the flux density .",
    "fortunately , the last radio observation considered here is almost simultaneous with a recent infrared observation ( duchne et al .",
    "2002 ) . as fig .",
    "1e shows , at that epoch , the radio source t tau s is coincident within the errors with the infrared source t tau sb .    a quick inspection of fig",
    ".  1 immediately shows significant large - scale motions , with both components of the system moving towards the south  east . to characterize these motions , we determined the positions of the two sources at each epoch using gaussian fits , and corrected these positions for the effect of the trigonometric parallax : a maximum of 7 mas , almost entirely in right ascension . the resulting motion of t tau n ( fig .",
    "2 ) appears to be remarkably linear , with translational proper motions of @xmath13cos @xmath14 = 12.2 @xmath15 0.6 mas yr@xmath0 ; @xmath16 = 12.7 @xmath15 0.6 mas yr@xmath0 , very similar to the values given in the hipparcos catalog ( perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) and by jones & herbig ( 1979 ) .",
    "following previous works ( loinard 2002 ; loinard et al .",
    "2002 ; rodrguez et al .  2003 ; curiel et al .",
    "2003 ) , we interpret these linear motions as due to the overall motion with respect to the sun of the region where t tauri is located .    the motion of t tau s is more complex : it follows the same trend as t tau n until about 1992 , but around 1995 , it starts to move westwards ( fig .",
    "because it is so close to t tau sa , t tau sb is most likely to be in gravitational interaction with it , so it is important to determine the motion of t tau sb relative to t tau sa .",
    "since t tau sa is not actually seen in the radio images , this involves two steps : first correcting the absolute motion of t tau sb for the large scale , nearly linear , motion of t tau n ; and then correcting for the motion of t tau sa relative to t tau n. the former step is easily done by subtracting , for each epoch , the absolute position of t tau n ( fig .",
    "2a , b ) to the absolute position of t tau sb .",
    "the latter step can be done fairly accurately because the relative motion of t tau n and t tau sa is relatively well constrained thanks to multi - epoch near - infrared observations .",
    "using all the available data ( ghez et al .",
    "1995 ; roddier et al .",
    "2000 ; duchne et al .",
    "2002 ) , we estimate that the orbital motion of t tau sa around t tau n results in rates of change of + @xmath17 yr@xmath0 for the position angle , and of 3.4 mas yr@xmath0 for the separation .",
    "this is a somewhat smaller rate of change for the angular position than reported by roddier et al .",
    "the difference comes from our taking into account the latest observation by duchne et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . at the epoch of that observation",
    "( late 2000 ) , the position angle between n and sa was only @xmath18 , significantly less than the extrapolation from the data of roddier et al .",
    "relative to sa , the radio source t tau s appears to first follow a roughly elliptical path , then approach t tau sa around 19951998 , and then rapidly move away from it between 1998 to 2001 ( fig .",
    "3 ) . during the last 5.5 years of observation",
    ", it has moved by about 150 mas ; at a distance of 140 pc , this proper motion corresponds to a projected velocity of @xmath7 20 km s@xmath0 , very similar to the projected velocity of t tau sb reported by duchne et al .",
    "this further confirms the identity between the radio source t tau s and the infrared source t tau sb .",
    "it also implies that the motion seen in the radio does not trace a shock phenomenon ( a herbig - haro - like nebulosity ) but truly a stellar motion since t tau sb is known from infrared spectroscopy ( duchne et al .",
    "2002 ) to be a pre - main sequence m star .    from 1983 to 1995",
    ", the motion of t tau sb relative to t tau sa appears to follow kepler s second law : roughly equal areas are swept during equal times .",
    "this suggests that the first part of the motion does reflect a bound , elliptical orbit . under this assumption , one can estimate the mass of the t tau s system using kepler s third law . given the projected semi - major axis ( a @xmath7 9 au ) of the orbit , and the apparent period ( p @xmath7 20 yr ) a lower limit of 2 m@xmath19",
    "is required . since sb is a pre - main sequence star of type m1 ( duchne et al .",
    "2002 ) its mass is about 0.5 m@xmath19 .",
    "hence , sa must have a mass larger than about 1.5 m@xmath19 .",
    "the second part of the path , on the other hand , follows a significantly different trend . while the distance between sa and sb changes by about the same amount from 1998 to 2001 , as from 1989 to 1995 , the more recent part has been covered at twice the velocity of the first part ( 20 km s@xmath0 instead of 10 km s@xmath0  fig .",
    "interestingly , the total mass required to keep the motion bound given the separation and velocity in late 2000 is at least 5 m@xmath19 .",
    "this mass is quite larger than would be expected for such a low - luminosity young object .",
    "t tau s has a bolometric luminosity of 11 l@xmath19  ( koresko , herbst , & leinert 1997 ) , that can be provided by a single pre - main sequence star with a mass of 1 to 2 m@xmath19  ( kenyon & hartmann 1995 ) .",
    "a 5 m@xmath19  pre - main sequence star is expected to have a bolometric luminosity of several hundred solar luminosities , an order of magnitude higher than the measured luminosity of t tau s.    fig .",
    "3 also shows that the radio source was close to the nominal position of sa only between 1995 and 1998 .",
    "at all other epochs , the separation between sa and the radio source was large enough that the radio source could not have been sa .",
    "this implies that the radio source is very likely to have been sb during the entire time span of the vla observations , and that we are not witnessing a `` christmas tree '' effect where the radio source corresponds sometimes to sa and sometimes to sb .",
    "the existence of one or more additional radio sources which would have switched on and off during the observations appears as a particularly unlikely and _ ad hoc _ possibility .",
    "the analysis of the polarization of the 2 cm radio emission of t tau s ( johnston et al .",
    "2003 ) further confirms this point since t tau s is found to have consistently exhibited of the order of 10% of left circular polarization ( lcp ) over the entire time - span covered by the observations .    between 1995 and 1998 , sb has passed within about 15 mas ( 2 au ) of sa ( fig .",
    "such close encounters between a single low - mass star and a double system can lead to the ejection of the low - mass object , with a velocity of the order of the escape velocity at that separation ( sterzik & durisen 1998 ; anosova 1986 ) .",
    "for a 1.5 m@xmath19  system , the escape velocity at 2 au is 35 km s@xmath0 , about twice the current projected velocity of sb .",
    "the radio source t tau s ( or , equivalently , the infrared source t tau sb ) is , therefore , likely to be currently moving westward as a result of its recent ejection from the system . in this scheme ,",
    "t tau sa would be a close binary system with a separation smaller than about 2 au , and with a total mass of about 1.5  m@xmath19 ; such a system would have an orbital period of approximately 2 years .",
    "two pre - main sequence stars , each with a mass of about 0.5 to 1 m@xmath19  would provide the required mass , and would have a total luminosity compatible with that of t tau s.    as mentioned earlier , the first part of the orbit of sb around sa ( 1983 to 1995 ) can be fitted by an ellipse ( dotted curve in fig .",
    "any subsequent large departure from this projected ellipse has to be taken as a change in the orbit , so from 1998 to 2001 sb must indeed have changed its original orbit .",
    "could this change be the result of a slight modification of the orbital plane due , for example , to viscous effects or to gravitational interaction with gaseous structures in the surrounding inhomogeneous medium ?",
    "for motions nearly along the line of sight , small angular changes in direction can indeed result in large projected effects .",
    "however , the motions considered here can not be nearly along the line of sight : the observed motions from 1998 to 2001 already imply a mass that is quite large given the luminosity of t tau s. to maintain the possibility of bound motion , we have to assume that the velocity vector from 1998 to 2001 is close to the plane of the sky . in this configuration , any small modification of",
    "the orbital plane will result in small projected changes .",
    "so , could we have observed a large change in the direction of the motion , without a significant change in the magnitude of the velocity vector ?",
    "although possible , it is a fairly unlikely event .",
    "equally large accelerations are needed to change significantly the direction or the magnitude of a velocity vector .",
    "why would all the acceleration go into changing only the direction of the velocity vector rather than changing both direction and magnitude ?",
    "we favor the interpretation that there was a large change in the velocity vector ( quite likely both in magnitude and in direction ) and that sb is in a very different , wider orbit leading to an ejection or even possibly an escape .",
    "a statistical objection could be made against this interpretation .",
    "the probability of detecting an ejection in a young multiple system appears , at first sight , to be quite small .",
    "non - hierarchical triple systems are inherently unstable and will eject a member on timescales of the order of one hundred crossing times ( anosova 1986 ) . a system like t tau s",
    "has a crossing time of order 10 years , so one should have to monitor about a hundred such systems over the timescales used in this paper to have a probability of order one to see an ejection .",
    "yet , only a handful of such systems has been monitored , so we seem to be witnessing an event with a probability of only a few percent .",
    "however , important selection effects could be at work .",
    "the systems that undergo ejection events must have had previously close encounters in which all three members met in a small volume of space .",
    "such close encounters will strongly enhance disk accretion and thus increase luminosity and outflow activity in the participating young stars .",
    "this is precisely the type of `` active '' stars that are studied more systematically .",
    "indeed , some of the mysterious properties of infrared companions ( such as t tau s ) could plausibly be related to such enhanced activity .",
    "we may then be selecting _ a priori _ systems which have undergone close encounters in the recent past , and which are more likely to suffer an ejection .        whether the change of orbit of t tau sb described here will ultimately lead to a full escape",
    "will be known if monitoring programs of t tauri in the near infrared and the radio are performed in the coming 5 years .",
    "an argument favoring the escape scenario is related to the relatively large eccentricity of the true orbit of t tau sb , that following hilditch ( 2001 ) , we can estimate to be @xmath20 = 0.8 @xmath15 0.2 . for an elliptical orbit of eccentricity @xmath20",
    "the velocity at periastron has to increase by @xmath21^{1/2 } - 1 $ ] for the motion to become unbound . for @xmath22 , a relatively small increase of 5% in the velocity will change the orbit from elliptical to parabolic .",
    "however , given the short timescale of the ejection events , one should have _ a priori _ a higher chance of seeing the * result * of the escape ( i.e.  a single star moving relatively fast compared to its environment ) than the escape itself . yet",
    ", there is only one known t tauri star which is moving fast compared to its surroundings ( rw aur  jones & herbig 1979 ) , and a few indirect evidences for fast moving younger sources ( arce & goodman 2002 ; reipurth et al .",
    "1999 ) or main sequence stars ( allen , poveda , & worley 1974 ; hoogerwert , de bruijne , & de zeeuw 2000 ) .",
    "we speculate that this relative lack of detected `` fast - moving '' stars , however , might also be a consequence of observational biases .",
    "if the escape occurs , the pre - main sequence star will likely be left with very little of its original surrounding material , so the accretion and ejection activity will abruptly be halted . within a very short time after the escape , the low - mass star is likely to reach a quiescent state , in which it would easily go unnoticed . moreover ,",
    "a star which would escape with a velocity only slightly above the escape velocity would have a small velocity once it reaches large distances from its original location ( recall that a star escaping with exactly the escape speed will have zero velocity once at infinity ) .",
    "it would have truly large velocities only for the short period of time just subsequent to the ejection .",
    "we acknowledge enriching discussions with gaspard duchne and arcadio poveda .",
    "comments made by bo reipurth , and the referee , alyssa goodman , significantly improved the quality of this paper .",
    "we thank barry clark and the vla data analysts for their help with the data retrieval process .",
    "we acknowledge support from conacyt and dgapa / unam ."
