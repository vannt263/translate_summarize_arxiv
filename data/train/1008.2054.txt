    "hoava s recent attempt to solve the quantum gravity problem @xcite by introducing higher spatial derivative curvature terms , which break lorentz invariance but ameliorate graviton - loop renormalization effects , has motivated research into other lorentz violating theories . in particular , there is growing interest in whether the good ultraviolat ( uv ) behavior of hoava - lifshitz gravity may be transferable to certain nonrenormalizable yang - mills gauge theories @xcite .",
    "models which include higher spatial derivative extensions  la hoava are collectively referred to as lifshitz field theories .",
    "the key idea of lifshitz field theories , in this context , is that by explicitly breaking lorentz invariance it is possible to write down an action with higher - order spatial derivatives while maintaining quadratic time derivatives and thus the unitarity of the theory .",
    "the uv properties of the radiative corrections in the theory are softened by the higher inverse powers of momentum appearing in the propagator .",
    "one interesting application is to field - theoretic models featuring extra dimensions of space .",
    "it is well - understood that the uv behavior degrades as the number of dimensions is increased . even increasing the spatial dimensions from three to four causes yang - mills theory to be nonrenormalizable .",
    "thus , lorentz - invariant field - theory models involving extra dimensions are inherently uv incomplete , and must be defined with a uv cutoff .",
    "but extra - dimensional lifshitz theories can be uv complete .",
    "the purpose of this article is to take the standard building blocks for a 4 + 1-dimensional lorentz invariant brane world model , collated in @xcite , and see if they can be extended to construct a lifshitz power counting renormalizable brane world model with quartic leading order spatial derivatives .",
    "we are principally interested in whether there is a lifshitz analogue to the domain - wall brane and if we can dynamically localize fermions .",
    "these two elements ( together with the dvali - shifman mechanism for dynamical gauge boson localization @xcite ) form the backbone for a dynamically localized domain - wall brane standard model . being an entree into the subject , we restrict our analysis here to a toy model featuring just a scalar and a fermion field . a full theory",
    "would of course require many more ingredients including gravity and gauge fields , but that is too ambitious a construction to attempt in one step .",
    "we stress that a lifshitz domain - wall brane model would be markedly different to previous work on extra - dimensional field theories and valuable because preceding work in this field has been entirely on effective field theories and by construction is only predictive up to a uv cutoff scale @xcite .    to this end",
    "we take the most general power - counting - renormalizable action for a real lifshitz scalar field @xmath2 living in 4 + 1-dimensions which is consistent with a discrete reflection symmetry @xmath3 , where the @xmath4 symmetry is necessary for generating topological boundary conditions . for this model",
    "we demonstrate that a kink or domain - wall type of topological defect in the lifshitz scalar field can condense to form a brane .",
    "however when we extend the action to incorporate fermions we find that the standard interpretation of the 3 + 1-dimensional left - chiral fermion , as the dynamically - localized zero mode in a kaluza - klein tower , fails .    in isotropic",
    "@xmath0-dimensional models , rubakov and shaposhnikov @xcite argue that at low energies @xmath0-dimensional spinors behave like @xmath1-dimensional left - chiral fermions localized on the brane .",
    "their justification is : given a solution @xmath5 to the isotropic @xmath0-dimensional dirac equation , there exists a basis for the space of continuous bounded functions of a single coordinate , @xmath6 , which can be used to project the field @xmath5 onto a ` kaluza - klein ' tower .",
    "this kaluza - klein tower contains a normalizable massless @xmath1-dimensional left - chiral zero - mode fermion plus massive @xmath1-dimensional fermions . at low energies only the dynamically - localized massless chiral zero mode in this tower",
    "is kinematically allowed and the effective low - energy dynamics carry the right phenomenological signature needed to model the quarks and leptons of the standard model .",
    "we take a solution to the lifshitz @xmath0-dimensional dirac equation with quartic leading order spatial derivatives .",
    "we write this solution as a kaluza - klein tower of @xmath1-dimensional spinors and we show that this tower does not contain a massless @xmath1-dimensional left - chiral zero mode fermion . we find that spatially isotropic lifshitz dirac equations do not have zero mode solutions as part of their kaluza - klein towers . to overcome this difficulty we consider other models which do not treat all four spatial dimensions symmetrically .",
    "we present the zero mode solution for a model where @xmath0-dimensional lorentz invariance is broken explicitly to @xmath7 spatial rotational invariance .    in secs .",

[ sec4 ] of this paper we shall explicitly demonstrate that , for the minimal case of a 4 + 1-dimensional model with quartic spatial derivatives , the euler - lagrange equations for a general power counting renormalizable lifshitz scalar field action have a domain - wall brane solution . in sec .  [ sec5 ]",
    "we review dimensional reduction of a fermion action via kaluza - klein decomposition and dynamical localization of a candidate 3 + 1-dimensional fermion .",
    "we then explain precisely where this technique fails for lifshitz extensions . in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] we discuss alternative models featuring compact extra - dimensions and smaller unbroken spatial symmetries .",

    "the lower case greek letters @xmath13 and @xmath14 are reserved for 3 + 1-dimensional 4-vectors so that @xmath15 .",
    "we will apply standard terminology directly to our model without qualifying that we are talking about a 4 + 1-dimensional , quartic leading order spatial derivatives extension to the standard theory before each statement .",
    "we will use these descriptors only when our intention is not clear from the context .",

    "the action is invariant under @xmath25-dimensional spatial rotations and translations but not under lorentz boosts .",
    "it is useful to introduce the concept of a critical exponent @xmath26 which characterizes the degree of anisotropy in the space - time manifold .",

    "lorentz invariance corresponds to @xmath32 .    to make expressions more compact we shall write @xmath33-dimensions for a foliated space - time manifold with weighted scaling characterized by ( [ eq : weightedscalingdimensions ] ) and in the isotropic space - time case",
    "we will drop the ` 1 ' subscript .",
    "ongoing research is critically examining whether coupling constant running can plausibly cause lorentz symmetry to emerge as an accidental symmetry in the infrared limit of @xmath34 lifshitz models @xcite .",
    "the recent insights in ref .",
    "@xcite now make it more plausible that the infrared limit of a suitably - defined version of hoava - lifshitz gravity can closely resemble pure general relativity , so we can hope that some similar progress will be made for emergent relativity in general . for the purposes of this paper we shall adopt the optimistic stance , though we recognize that the emergence of lorentz invariance in the infrared without fine - tuning is not a given .",
    "we start by defining a domain - wall brane . it is a kink - like topological defect which defines a ( finite thickness ) 3 + 1-dimensional hyperplane to be identified with our universe .",
    "the topological defect is provided by a real scalar field with an action @xmath35 such that the lowest energy density solution to the classical equations of motion , which asymptotically approaches distinct vacua , related by a discrete reflection symmetry , at opposite extremities of the extra - dimension , is a solitary wave .    in this section",
    "we isolate the real scalar field terms in the action .",
    "we work under the assumption that there is an equivalence relation on the space of all actions such that actions @xmath36 and @xmath37 are identified if they contain the same terms up to global boundary terms .",
    "by consistently following this principle we will discard all terms in the equations of motion which arise from boundary effects .",
    "therefore from an empirical perspective actions belonging to the same equivalence class will be phenomenologically indistinguishable .    to create a domain - wall brane",
    "our action must exhibit a discrete reflection symmetry @xmath38 . to simplify the model we choose to work in flat space - time .",
    "theory , and then establish that the brane tension causes the domain - wall to be a preferred observation hyperplane from which gravity appears to be 3 + 1-dimensional , and that the effective gravity theory on the wall is sufficiently close to general relativity . for domain - wall branes with 4 + 1-dimensional general relativity , the answer is provided by the randall - sundrum @xcite warped metric solution which involves pasting together two semi - infinite regions of anti - de sitter space - time with a matching junction condition at the location of the brane . this configuration can be used to dynamically localize a 3 + 1-dimensional kaluza - klein zero mode graviton .",
    "something resembling this solution would presumably also have to exist within the putative 4 + 1-dimensional hoava gravity theory .",
    "the most straight - forward approach would be to verify anti - de sitter space - time solutions in @xcite could be extended to the putative 4 + 1-dimensional hoava gravity theory before looking for an analogue to the randall - sundrum warped metric ansatz .",
    "these challenging problems are well beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "we have absorbed the coupling constant in front of @xmath43 into a rescaling of the field @xmath16 . in the weighted scaling dimensions of our theory we have",

    "it would thus be misleading to absorb the energy - scale - dependent @xmath50 by a relative rescaling of spatial and temporal coordinates .    the klein - gordon equation obtained from this action using",

    "[ numericalkink ] we give an example of a numerical domain - wall brane configuration .",

    "the numerical solution depicted in fig .",
    "[ numericalkink ] corresponds to a point which is not on this slice . because we want the solutions described by ( [ eq : kinksolution ] ) and ( [ eq : kinksolutionparameters ] ) to be real valued and because @xmath54 must be a minimum of the potential for ( [ eq : kinksolution ] ) to be a solitary wave , we can bound the allowed region of parameter space by the inequalities @xmath55 . indeed none of the results presented in this paper are contingent on providentially choosing parameters which satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : kinksolutionparameters ] ) .",
    "this establishes the existence of a domain - wall brane for @xmath56 space - time with anisotropic scaling characterized by critical exponent @xmath40 .",
    "the lifshitz domain wall is topologically stable for the same reason the usual domain wall is stable : the enforced discrete symmetry , when spontaneously broken , produces disconnected vacua which serve as the boundary conditions for the domain wall solution .",
    "the kink is a mapping from the boundary of the real line , parameterizing the extra dimension , onto the disconnected manifold @xmath57 .",
    "this mapping is homotopically non - trivial .",
    "thus , the domain wall is prevented from decaying to the lower - energy spatially - homogeneous vacua @xmath58 . intuitively , maintaining finite energy density forces the solution to asymptotically approach minima of the potential .",
    "once we have fixed @xmath59 and @xmath60 there is no way to continuously deform the solution while passing through intermediary states which also have boundary values pinned either at @xmath61 or @xmath62 and arrive at a solution for which @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "we have not analytically shown that our kink domain - wall brane is the lowest energy solution to the euler lagrange equations satisfying these boundary conditions .    in the following discussion",
    "we guarantee the kink solution has finite 3 + 1-dimensional energy density ( energy per unit of 3-dimensional volume ) .",
    "furthermore we show that the kink is stable under perturbations corresponding to a contraction or dilation of the transverse wall width .",
    "this suggests the kink is stable because perturbations which alter the profile in any of the @xmath65-coordinate directions are forbidden by @xmath66-rotational invariance .",
    "our background kink solution is invariant under 3-dimensional spatial rotations and there is no preferred direction in the hyperplane orthogonal to the @xmath20-coordinate , so it does not make sense to say a perturbation has formed along a specific direction in the @xmath65-coordinate space because all directions are relative to an arbitrary choice of reference axis @xcite .",
    "we are left with conjecturing about perturbations which do not deform the kink in any direction perpendicular to the bulk coordinate axis and do not correspond to rescaling the width of the domain wall .",
    "this means that we can only have perturbations which locally deform the kink according to some nonlinear dependence on @xmath20 .",
    "these are allowed because translational invariance is spontaneously broken by the condensation of the kink .",
    "a full perturbative stability analysis is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "our analytic kink ( [ eq : kinksolution ] ) has finite 3 + 1-dimensional energy density given by    @xmath67    naturally if we integrate this quantity with respect to the 3-dimensional volume element to obtain the total energy the answer will be infinite .",
    "this is the statement that domain - wall branes are technically only solitons in 1 + 1-dimensions .",
    "in fact in isotropic 4 + 1-dimensional theories derrick s theorem @xcite implies that all static non - homogeneous which have trivial @xmath68-dependence evade derrick s theorem . ] solutions to the klein - gordon equation have infinite total energy , independent of the precise set of self interaction terms in the action .",
    "intuitively derrick s theorem arises because a hypothetical static , stable , finite energy density solution , @xmath69 , to the euler lagrange equations would locally minimize the energy functional .",
    "however if we contract the soliton slightly , corresponding to @xmath70 where @xmath71 , then we find the energy functional scales according to @xmath72 = \\frac{2k^2 -1}{k^4 } e[\\phi_0(x^i)]\\ ] ] and will decrease as @xmath73 increases .",
    "this contradicts the hypothesis that @xmath74 $ ] is minimal .    in lifshitz theories the higher spatial derivatives change the scaling properties of the energy functional .",
    "effectively the higher spatial derivatives stabilize these perturbations and derrick s theorem can be evaded .",
    "this means we can not rule out finite total energy solution to the klein - gordon equation in lifshitz theories .",
    "however a finite total energy solution can not be homogeneous on 3 + 1-dimensional hyperplanes , so if we wish to avoid breaking 3-dimensional spatial rotational invariance then it will have to be radially symmetric and will therefore correspond to a point - like topological defect .",
    "this configuration can not provide a 3 + 1-dimensional brane .",
    "we find the prospect fascinating for other reasons but have delayed a full investigation to future work .",
    "the higher spatial derivatives in lifshitz theories also modify the virial theorem . for a 1 + 1-dimensional , solitary wave solution @xmath75 to the klein - gordon equation ( [ eq : kleingordon ] ) , there is a relation between the contribution to the energy density from the gradient of the field , and the potential energy density .",

    "this is particularly true if @xmath135 depends in any way on the derivative @xmath141 of the topological defect which is large around @xmath142 because @xmath143 is varying rapidly at the location of the wall .",
    "shrinking the width of the wall will make the gradient of @xmath143 larger around @xmath144 and make any dependence of @xmath135 on precise @xmath20-coordinate location more pronounced . with this assumption",

    "this follows from substituting the asymptotic form @xmath180 for the analytic kink @xmath143 given in ( [ eq : kinksolution ] ) into the expression for @xmath132 ( [ eq : profiles ] ) and taking the appropriate limits . the left - chiral profile function @xmath132 decays exponentially in both directions and therefore given @xmath181 , @xmath182 such that @xmath183 and on the compact region @xmath184 we can argue that @xmath132 is continuous and hence attains a finite maximum , thus @xmath132 is bounded .",
    "we can now solve eq .",

    "however if we derive the free scalar field klein - gordon equation directly from a @xmath193 , @xmath66 invariant action for @xmath16 we will arrive at @xmath194 the domain - wall brane ( [ eq : kinksolution ] ) will still be a solution to ( [ eq : so(3)kleingoron ] ) .",
    "in fact in the spatially anisotropic scenario where lorentz invariance is broken directly to @xmath195 spatial rotational invariance and the real scalar field klein - gordon equation ( involving self interaction terms ) has the form :    @xmath196    our solitary wave domain - wall brane ( [ eq : kinksolution ] ) will be a solution provided the free parameters satisfy ( [ eq : kinksolutionparameters ] ) with the identifications @xmath197 .    from a comparison of ( [ eq : so(3)kleingoron ] ) and ( [ so(3)fermionkleingordon ] ) we infer that the fermions and bosons will now propagate according to different dispersion relations .",
    "it is easy to check that if we insist on writing down a dirac equation for which the solutions @xmath198 are also solutions to ( [ eq : so(3)kleingoron ] ) for the case @xmath199 ( this will circumvent our previous problem of mixed partial derivative operators ) then we will have to use a 7-dimensional clifford algebra .",
    "this forces the smallest representation for our spinor @xmath5 to consist of 8-component column matrices and ultimately once this dirac equation has been solved we find that the ` zero mode ' has too many degrees of freedom to be given the interpretation of a massless chiral fermion .",
