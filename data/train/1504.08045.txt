    "it is widely believed that magnetic reconnection energizes electrons and is the source of superthermal electrons observed during solar flare events @xcite and through _ in situ _ measurements in the earth s magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "several previous studies of reconnection conclude that the dissipation sites ( where electrons are energized ) are limited to electron scale regions and are insufficient in size to account for the large scale electron energization . to circumvent this conundrum",
    "recent models have invoked the possibility of multiple reconnection locations and flux - rope formation , which can facilitate energy release in a larger spatial volume and thereby help energize the large number of electrons required by observations @xcite .",
    "while there exists clear evidence of magnetic flux - ropes forming in the earth s magnetosphere , these flux - ropes do not appear to be volume filling such that energization at multiple x - lines becomes effective @xcite .",
    "this suggests that energization within the exhaust from a single x - line needs to be efficient to account for the extensive energization levels recorded experimentally .",
    "we therefore revisit electron energization in single x - line reconnection and find that superthermal electrons are produced over large spatial scales in the single x - line reconnection exhaust when the total pressure of the plasma upstream of the reconnection region is dominated by the magnetic field ( @xmath5 ) . in our kinetic simulation , a key to the strong electron energization is the break - down of adiabatic electron dynamics along the magnetic field lines , which , we find , is likely to occur when @xmath2 .",
    "the documented heating mechanism and non - adiabatic parallel electron dynamics lead to the formation of strong magnetic field , aligned ( parallel ) electric fields , @xmath0 .",
    "these structures are consistent with double layers , where local charge separation generates strong parallel electric fields @xcite .",
    "the double layers provide an initial energization of electrons streaming into the reconnection region ( and exhaust ) along field lines .",
    "in addition , the double layer @xmath0 helps confine the electrons within the reconnection region , allowing for further energization by the reconnection electric field over the duration of multiple electron bounce orbits .",
    "the resulting electron distribution functions have characteristic signatures shaped by the interplay between the parallel and perpendicular electric fields during the energization process , which compare favorably to electron distributions observed _ in situ _ by spacecraft in the earth s magnetotail @xcite .",
    "as is the case for the magnetotail , @xmath6 is also believed to be small upstream of reconnection sites associated with solar flares @xcite , where the electron confinement provided by @xmath0 may also be important to explain the long lifetime of hard x - ray sources at flare loop - tops @xcite .    in previous work",
    "@xcite we have mostly analyzed scenarios including a guide magnetic field sufficient in strength that the magnetic moments , @xmath7 , of the electrons are conserved , yielding adiabatic ( time reversible ) electron dynamics for both the parallel and perpendicular electron dynamics .",
    "here we consider anti - parallel reconnection , which includes unmagnetized chaotic electron behavior in the reconnection exhaust leading to irreversible electron dynamics .",
    "more important for the energization process , however , is the aforementioned break - down of the adiabatic electron dynamics parallel to the magnetic field , causing the formation of large scale @xmath0 regions .",
    "the spatial extent of these regions is not tied to kinetic scales and expands with the reconnection exhaust .",
    "this suggests that the presented heating mechanism may be applicable to systems like solar flares , which are much larger than the simulation domain @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the formation of strong double layers , which form along the reconnection separators .",
    "the double layers are responsible in part for the confinement of electrons in the exhaust and we derive a threshold for their development . in sec",
    "iii we consider properties of the exhaust where pitch angle mixing is effective , and derive the rate for the energization of electrons trapped in the exhaust . in sec .",
    "iv we investigate the electron distributions that form within the exhaust , providing an explanation for the observed electron flat - top distributions .",
    "in addition , a model is derived for the superthermal electrons which is in good agreement with the kinetic simulations results . in sec .",
    "v the numerical and theoretical results are compared to spacecraft observations and the paper is concluded in sec .",
    "in this paper we document and analyze numerical simulation results obtained with the vpic fully kinetic plasma simulation code @xcite , implementing a configuration with @xmath9 .",
    "the two - dimensional simulation is initialized with a harris neutral sheet , and open boundary conditions are employed in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 directions .",
    "the initial particle distributions include counter - drifting maxwellian ion and electron populations localized to support the harris current layer .",
    "in addition , a separate background density is included , resulting in a total density profile @xmath12sech@xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the central harris density , @xmath15 is a uniform background density and @xmath16 for this simulation .",
    "the ion - to - electron temperature ratio of the harris population is @xmath17 , whereas the temperatures , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , for the uniform background populations have the same ratio , but are a factor of three colder for both species .",
    "lengths are normalized by the ion @xmath20 based on the harris sheet density @xmath14 , in a domain size of @xmath21 .",
    "other parameters are @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",

    "@xmath8 is defined as @xmath29 and is a pseudo potential which measures the integrated parallel electric field @xmath0 along the magnetic field lines . because of the large electron thermal speed the magnetic field lines can often be considered stationary during a single electron transit @xcite .",

    "[ fig : early ] , the relatively large pressure anisotropy and large values of @xmath31 in the inflow are accurately described by the self - consistent adiabatic electron model derived in refs .",

    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 is the normalized electron pressure upstream of the reconnecting current sheet .    beside the break - down of the magnetic moment as an invariant",
    ", a second mechanism also causes the adiabatic eos to become invalid .",
    "this second mechanism is related to non - adiabatic effects in the parallel particle motion , and occurs at small values of @xmath6 . to estimate the critical value of @xmath6 marking the transition to the non - adiabatic regime , we note that one important requirement for adiabatic parallel behavior is that changes in @xmath8 for a flux - tube moving into the reconnection region must be small during an electron transit through the region . to quantify this condition",
    "we revisit the derivation of the adiabatic model in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a key element for solving the drift kinetic equation is an assumed ordering @xmath41 @xmath42 here @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the typical length scales across and along the reconnection region , respectively , with @xmath45 .",

    ".  @xcite corresponds to the limit where only electrons with small parallel energy may become trapped .",
    "this requires that during an electron transit time @xmath49 the changes in the magnetic and electric well ( trapping electrons ) must be small compared to @xmath19 .",
    "if this condition is not satisfied the parallel electron behavior may become non - adiabatic .",
    "following eq .",
    "13 of ref .",

    "again , the simulation studied here is for a value @xmath9 , and indeed , at later times in the run strong non - adiabatic behavior is observed , resulting in values of @xmath60 and @xmath31 much larger than those predicted by the adiabatic theory .",
    "as mentioned above , the acceleration potential with @xmath61 in fig .",

    "thus , for @xmath81 almost no escaping electrons ( electrons with @xmath82 ) are observed .    the magnitude of the double layer in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispaling56](f ) is still large .",
    "in addition to the incoming beam , the double layer is now being filled with energetic electrons streaming away from the reconnection site and reflected back again by the double layer .",
    "considering the evolution of @xmath76 in figs .",
    "[ fig : dispaling56](b - f ) it is clear that the acceleration by @xmath8 of the incoming electron beam and the subsequent mixing in electron holes is responsible for the main heating of the electrons on these field lines intersecting the density cavities .",

    "this is evident in figs .",
    "[ fig : dispaling56](g , h ) where the incoming electron beam now has velocities on the order of @xmath83 .",
    "the reduced values of @xmath8 allow energized electrons to escape the reconnection region and finite values of @xmath76 are thus observed for @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",
    "these escaping electrons carry a significant heat flux away from the reconnection region .      recently , li _ et al_.  @xcite investigated the formation of double layers at the interface between hot electrons energized at the reconnection site and cold electrons streaming into the reconnection region along field lines .",
    "their numerical studies document electron holes and double layers with signatures similar to those observed in our simulations outside the density cavities ( i.e.  in figs .",
    "[ fig : dispaling56](g , h ) ) .",
    "they modelled the hot electrons from the reconnection region as a maxwellian with a temperature @xmath84 and observed double layer amplitudes , @xmath85 , less than @xmath84 .",
    "this moderate amplitude allows for a significant fraction of the energetic electrons to escape @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the strong double layers that form within the density cavities in figs .  [ fig : dispaling56](c - f ) appear to have some characteristics different from those studied by li _ et al _ .. for example , we here observe an amplitude much larger than the energy of electrons energized at the reconnection site , allowing no electrons to escape by parallel streaming along field lines .",
    "furthermore , the development of these large amplitude double layers is not driven by hot electrons streaming away from the reconnection region .",
    "this is clear because the strong double layer structure at @xmath65 in figs .",
    "[ fig : dispaling56](c - d ) ) develops before energetic electrons from the reconnection region reach this location ( about 40 @xmath86 downstream of the x - line ) .",
    "below we argue that the strong double layers ( distinct from the double layers outside the density cavities ) form not just to reduce free streaming losses , but primarily to boost the electron density within the reconnection region .    from the principle of quasi - neutrality , electric fields in a plasma",

    "[ fig : jpar](a ) contours of the parallel electron flux are shown for the reconnection region , and large fluxes of electrons @xmath87 flow toward the reconnection region .",
    "thus , this flow is stronger than the incoming parallel flux of upstream electrons @xmath88 .    to understand why the parallel flux of electrons is needed , we consider the blue area , @xmath89 on the schematic flux - tube in fig .",
    "[ fig : jpar](b ) . during the reconnection process",
    "this area convects into the larger green area @xmath90 . from magnetic flux conservation within the flux - tube ,",
    "the areas of the blue and green regions are related as @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are representative magnetic field strengths within the two areas . as the in - plane magnetic field vanishes at the x - line ,",
    "as is ubiquitous in reconnection we have @xmath94 .",
    "the areas considered are within the ion diffusion region where the ions are decoupled from the magnetic field lines .",
    "the simulation shows that within this region the ion density , @xmath95 , is nearly uniform , such that area @xmath90 includes an increased number of ions compared to area @xmath96 .",
    "this increase can be estimated as @xmath97 meanwhile , the electrons are _ frozen in _ to the magnetic field in their perpendicular motion , so the matching increase @xmath98 of electrons ( required for quasi neutrality ) must be supplied by a parallel electron flux @xmath99 .        to estimate @xmath100 we consider again the characteristic length scales @xmath43 and @xmath44 across and along the reconnection region .",
    "previous studies ( including ref .",
    "@xcite ) have established that the inflow velocity upstream of the ion diffusion region is @xmath101 , with @xmath102 .",
    "meanwhile , inside the ion diffusion region the velocity of the flux - tubes are enhanced by the factor @xmath103 yielding @xmath104 .",
    "thus , region @xmath96 with length @xmath44 convects into region @xmath90 during a time @xmath105 .",

    "less pronounced density cavities are typical along the separators , and it has been argued that they develop to maintain pressure balance perpendicular to separators @xcite .",
    "we here emphasize the role of electrons streaming into the reconnection region as the more important cause for the near depletion of electrons from the density cavities . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this additional mechanism for density depletion is described here for the first time .",
    "we also note that the resulting pattern of the parallel electron currents along the separators are largely responsible for the characteristic hall magnetic field of the reconnection region @xcite .",
    "the development of the observed strong double layers is likely to be suppressed when @xmath112 , allowing thermal streaming of electrons to supply the reconnection region with the electrons needed . with eq .",

    "because the subsequent energization by @xmath3 is propotional to @xmath290 , the initial energy boost that electrons acquire from @xmath30 largely determines the overall efficiency of the energization process .",
    "the large amplitude structure of @xmath8 also limits the free streaming particle losses along magnetic field lines , which is essential for confining the electrons and shaping the spectra of their energy distribution .",
    "the heating is effective in the full exhaust of a single x - line configuration , and does not require pressure anisotropy to develop .",
    "the large values of @xmath0 are observed within density cavities and develop in association with the strong double layers . a threshold",
    ", @xmath295 is derived for the strong double layer formation , suggesting that these are likely to be present during solar flare events .",
    "indeed , the level of electron energization observed in the simulation is consistent with that observed during solar flares .",
    "furthermore , we show the details of the electron distribution functions described in our analysis are in agreement with _ in situ _ spacecraft measurements obtained over the last decade during reconnection events in the earth s magnetotail .",
    "the work at uw - madison was funded in part by nasa grant nnx14ac68 g .",
    "the numerical simulation work was supported by the nasa heliophysics theory program at lanl .",
    "initial simulations were carried out using lanl institutional computing resources and the pleiades computer at nasa , while the final simulation was carried out on kraken with an allocation of advanced computing resources provided by the national science foundation at the national institute for computational sciences ( http://www.nics.tennessee.edu/ ) .",
    "in this appendix we first discuss why the guiding center model can provide an accurate prediction of the electron heating rate for the pitch angle mixed exhaust .",
    "we then estimate the heating rate based on this model and recover result given above in eq .  .",
    "we thereby validate the above estimate and highlight the similarity ( and differences ) between the results in the present paper compared to those of earlier works using the guiding center model @xcite .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : f2](b ) above it is clear that the main heating source of the electrons is the perpendicular electric fields , and thus , the local heating results from the term @xmath296 , where @xmath297 is the electron fluid velocity also appearing in the electron momentum equation : @xmath298 due to the low values of @xmath139 in the exhaust , the magnetic moments of the electrons are not conserved .",
    "the particle motion therefore becomes chaotic and all pitch angle information is lost as electrons pass through the midplane .",
    "we are therefore only interested in the average electron behavior as a function of energy .",
    "it is clear that the guiding center approximation with the drifts @xmath299 does not formally apply ( where @xmath300 with @xmath301 is the curvature drift and @xmath302 is the gradient - b drift ) .",
    "nevertheless , by direct evaluation of the expression @xmath303 , with the magnetization @xmath195 , it is well known that @xmath297 in eq .",
    "is recovered for the relevant limit where @xmath304 has no off diagonal stress @xcite .",
    "therefore , although the guiding center approximation does not account for the chaotic motion of the individual electrons , it does accurately predict the total fluid drift .",
    "furthermore , the predicted contribution to @xmath297 from particles within a given energy interval is also accurate .",
    "the guiding center approximation thus allows us to estimate the _ average _ electron drift ( and associated energization ) as a function of energy .    to derive an expression for @xmath305 using the guiding center model",
    ", we note that previous studies in similar geometries have found that curvature drifts dominate the particle motion in the direction of the reconnection electric field @xcite .",
    "therefore , we here estimate the energy changes over a single bounce orbit caused by the curvature drift , @xmath306 . using @xmath307 where @xmath121 is the radius of curvature for the magnetic field line and @xmath308 we obtain @xmath309 , as the average energization per bounce . using @xmath310",
    "we obtain @xmath311 where we have used @xmath312 .",
    "thus , we find that @xmath313 this order of magnitude estimate of the heating rate is consistent with the result in sec .",
    "[ heating ] .",
    "in fact , taking the orbit length as four times the half exhaust width , @xmath314 , we recover the expression in eq .  .",
