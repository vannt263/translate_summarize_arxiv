    "measurement of income inequality to evaluate social welfare is of particular interest to economics .",
    "since the size distribution of income is the basis of inequality measures , correct specification of the income density function is of great importance .",
    "the study of the income size distribution has a long history .",
    "pareto @xcite apparently was responsible for the first attempt at defining a general `` law '' that tried to explain the regularities of observed distributions .",
    "let @xmath1 be the percentage of individuals with incomes greater than or equal to @xmath2 .",
    "then , the ( strong ) pareto law asserts that @xmath3 for some @xmath4 and the support of @xmath1 is @xmath5 .",
    "available empirical work leaves little doubt that pareto law , as it stands , does not account satisfactorily for a wide range of incomes .",
    "subsequently , the use of other density functions to model the income distribution , such as the lognormal @xcite or gamma @xcite , has been advocated .",
    "however , rapidly accruing evidence showed that the lognormal and gamma distributions fit the data relatively well in the middle range of income but tend to exaggerate the skewness and perform poorly in the upper end @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "if one s attention is restricted to the upper tail of the distributions , the evidence does not contradict the ( strong ) pareto law , provided that the chosen @xmath6 is large enough .",
    "this suggests that observed distributions obey a weak version of the pareto law @xcite , i.e. @xmath7 for @xmath1 with support @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and some well - known density functions that have been proposed and implemented in the literature asymptotically approach ( rather than coincide with ) the pareto distribution . among these ,",
    "the singh - maddala @xcite and dagum @xcite distributions have shown them to be a good compromise between parsimony and goodness - of - fit in many instances .",
    "distributions exhibiting pareto fat tails have been observed experimentally also in physical statistical systems .",
    "since they differs from the ordinary exponential distributions , this fact needs a theoretical explanation . in the last few decades several physical mechanisms",
    "have been considered in order to justify the non - exponential equilibrium distributions .",
    "for instance , deviations from the exponential distribution can be originated by quantum effects @xcite or by anomalous diffusion which introduces nonlinearities in the particle kinetics both in the fokker - planck @xcite and in the boltzmann picture @xcite of the system .    in physics",
    ", the deviation of the distribution function from the exponential distribution , i.e. the power - law tails , presents at high energies .",
    "then the relativistic origin of this effect appears as the more natural .",
    "recently , a statistical distribution based on the following one - parameter deformation of the exponential function @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 , has been proposed by one the authors @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-exponential can be inverted easily and the @xmath0-logarithm is defined by @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath12 .",
    "the mechanism generating the latter deformation is originated by the microscopic einstein relativistic dynamics @xcite and for the deformation parameter it results @xmath15 , being @xmath16 the light speed .",
    "the value of @xmath17 is due to the finite value of the light speed and the deformation is originated ultimately by the lorentz transformations .    in order to better explain how the special relativity conditioned the form of the @xmath0-exponential function we recall that the relativistic momenta @xmath2 and @xmath18 of two identical particles @xmath19 and @xmath20 which move in the same direction , if observed in the rest frame of the particle @xmath20 becomes @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "the relativistic composition law @xmath23 for the dimensionless momenta , according to the lorentz transformations , is a generalized sum defined through @xmath24 the @xmath0-exponential satisfies the functional equation @xmath25 which , in the classical limit @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 , reduces to the classical equation @xmath29 of the ordinary exponential function .",
    "the relativistic sum defined in equation induces a relativistic generalized mathematics where all the mathematical operators and functions emerge properly deformed .",
    "for instance the ordinary derivative operator transforms into the @xmath0-derivative given by @xmath30 within this theoretical framework the @xmath0-exponential emerges as the relativistic generalization of the ordinary exponential . in particular it holds the relationship @xmath31 which is the relativistic generalization of the classical equation @xmath32 involving the ordinary derivative and exponential .",
    "the ordinary exponential function @xmath33 emerges both at low energies , being @xmath34 as well as when the deformation parameter @xmath0 approaches zero , i.e. @xmath35 . on the contrary , for high values of @xmath2 the function @xmath36 presents power - law tails @xmath37    the statistical mechanics based on @xmath38 preserves the legendre structures of the ordinary statistical mechanics and the underlying entropy is stable @xcite .",
    "the relevant statistical distribution at low energies is just the boltzmann distribution according to equation , while at high energies presents presents power - law tails according to equation .",
    "the particularly interesting mathematical properties of the @xmath0-exponential permit us to see this function as a very flexible mathematical tool in order to study efficiently also non - physical systems .",
    "indeed , in the literature this function have been used extensively in several fields beyond the relativity , e.g. in dynamical systems at the edge of chaos , in fractal systems , in game theory , in error theory , in economics and so on .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that the einstein relativity has the same basis of the galilei relativity of classical physics , except for the presence of an extra einstein principle , asserting that the information propagates with a finite speed ( @xmath17 ) and not instantaneously ( @xmath39 ) as professed in classical physics .",
    "this so natural relativistic principle relegates the ordinary exponential at the status of an abstract and nonphysical function and legitimates the use of the function @xmath0-exponential in the analysis of real systems .",
    "in this paper we exploit the deformed exponential function as a functional relationship that is more flexible than the standard one to build statistical models by adapting it to the context of income size distribution . using such a deformed exponential function",
    "is attractive because it allows one to statistically describe the whole spectrum of the size distribution of incomes , ranging from the low region to the middle region , and up to the pareto tail .",
    "the @xmath0-deformed statistical model leads to a more general formulation that contains both pareto and stretched exponential distributions as limiting cases .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : thekappageneralizedstatisticaldistribution ] , we examine the theoretical properties of what we refer to as the @xmath0-generalized distribution and show how it is able to account for some basic stylized facts of personal income data , such as the weak pareto law and possessing at least one interior mode . in section [ sec : empiricalapplicationtousincomedata ] , in order to test the performance of the proposed distribution , we provide an empirical application to the u.s . personal income data .",
    "the paper is concluded in section [ sec : concludingremarks ] .",
    "in view of their importance for the proposed statistical model , in the following we firstly recall some basic mathematical properties of the @xmath0-deformed exponential and logarithm functions . then we give formulas for the shape , moments and standard tools for inequality measurement .",
    "these include , among others , the ubiquitous lorenz curve and the associated gini measure of income inequality .",
    "in addition , we also discuss a method for parameter estimation .      the power - law asymptotic behavior of @xmath38 as given by equation reappears also in the function @xmath41 , namely    @xmath42    and @xmath43    like the ordinary functions ,",
    "also the deformed ones have the properties    @xmath44    @xmath45    and    @xmath46^{r}=\\exp_{\\kappa / r}\\left(rx\\right ) , \\label{eq : equation9a}\\ ] ]    @xmath47    the taylor expansions of the functions @xmath38 and @xmath41 are given by    @xmath48    and @xmath49    respectively , and hold for @xmath50 .      in the last few years the @xmath0-exponential function",
    "was adopted successfully to analyze also non - physical systems , including economic systems . in particular , the @xmath0-deformation has been employed in order to propose the so - called @xmath51-deformed multinomial logit model to study differentiated product markets @xcite and to model the personal income distribution @xcite . in this latter application",
    "the distribution function was defined through @xmath52 where @xmath11 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the income variable @xmath2 is defined as @xmath55 , being @xmath56 the absolute personal income and @xmath57 its mean value .",
    "the corresponding density reads @xmath58 while the quantile function is available in the following closed form @xmath59^{1/\\alpha } , \\label{eq : equation13}\\ ] ] with @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    as @xmath26",
    "this model tends to the stretched exponential distribution ; it can be easily verified that    @xmath62    and @xmath63    for low incomes ( @xmath50 ) the distribution behaves similarly to the stretched exponential equation and equation , while at high incomes it approaches a pareto distribution with scale @xmath64 and shape @xmath65 , i.e.    @xmath66    and @xmath67    thus satisfying the weak pareto law @xcite @xmath68 which is a rephrased version of equation .    from equation",
    "we easily determine that the median of the distribution is @xmath69^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}. \\label{eq : equation18}\\ ] ]    the mode is at @xmath70\\biggr.\\\\ & \\left.\\cdot\\left(\\sqrt{1+\\frac{4\\kappa^{2}\\left(\\alpha^{2}-\\kappa^{2}\\right)\\left(\\alpha-1\\right)^{2}}{\\left[\\alpha^{2}+2\\kappa^{2}\\left(\\alpha-1\\right)\\right]^{2}}}-1\\right)\\right\\}^{\\frac{1}{2\\alpha } } \\end{split } \\label{eq : equation19}\\ ] ] if @xmath71 ; otherwise , the distribution is zero - modal with a pole at the origin .",
    "the moment about zero of order @xmath72 of @xmath73 , with @xmath74 , can be obtained in closed form and is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the gamma function .",
    "therefore , the moment of order @xmath77 expressed in terms of the density function equation , i.e. @xmath78 , equals @xmath79 specifically , @xmath80 is the mean of the distribution and the variance , @xmath81 , is defined as @xmath82^{2}\\right\\}. \\label{eq : equation22}\\ ] ] hence , the coefficient of variation , @xmath83 , equals @xmath84    it is also possible to define the standardized measures @xmath85 and @xmath86 of skewness and kurtosis , respectively , given by @xmath87 and @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the moment about the mean of order @xmath77 .      for a discussion of income inequality",
    ", the standard practice adopts the concept of concentration of incomes as defined by lorenz @xcite .",
    "the so - called lorenz curve measures the cumulative fraction of population with incomes below @xmath2 along the horizontal axis , and the fraction of the total income this population accounts for along the vertical axis .",
    "the points plotted for the various values of @xmath2 trace out a curve below the @xmath90 line sloping upwards to the right from the origin .    in statistical terms , for any general distribution supported on the nonnegative half - line with a finite and positive first moment the lorenz curve is available in terms of the first - moment distribution @xmath91 .",
    "thus we have the lorenz curve for the @xmath0-generalized distribution as follows @xmath92^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}\\right.\\\\ & \\biggl.+b_{x}\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\kappa}-\\frac{1}{2\\alpha},\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right)+b_{x}\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\kappa}-\\frac{1}{2\\alpha}+1,\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right)\\biggr\\ } , \\end{split } \\label{eq : equation27}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is the incomplete beta function with @xmath94 .",
    "the related gini coefficient of inequality @xcite can be easily derived using its representation in terms of order statistics @xcite , i.e. @xmath95^{2}\\operatorname{d } x$ ] ; this yields @xmath96    furthermore , other summary inequality measures can be derived which are well - known and of widespread use in the econometric literature . for instance , in the context of the @xmath0-deformed distribution the generalized entropy ( ge ) class of inequality measures @xcite assumes the form @xmath97 - 1\\right\\ } , \\label{eq : equation29}\\ ] ] with @xmath98 .",
    "equation defines a class because the index @xmath99 assumes different forms depending on the value assigned to @xmath100 . from an operational point of view , two limiting cases of equation are of particular interest for inequality measurement : the mean logarithmic deviation index , @xmath101 , given by @xmath102 , \\label{eq : equation30}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is the euler - mascheroni constant and @xmath104 is the digamma function , and the theil @xcite index , @xmath105 , defined as @xmath106 . \\end{split } \\label{eq : equation31}\\ ] ] other ge indexes often used in applied work are the bottom - sensitive index , @xmath107 } , \\label{eq : equation32}\\ ] ] and the top - sensitive index ( or half the squared coefficient of variation ) , @xmath108    finally , the atkinson index @xcite for inequality aversion parameter @xmath109 can be easily computed from @xmath99 by exploiting the relationship @xmath110^{\\frac{1}{1-\\epsilon } } , \\label{eq : equation34}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 .",
    "the limiting form as @xmath112 is @xmath113      parameter estimation for the @xmath0-generalized distribution can be performed using the maximum likelihood ( ml ) approach .",
    "assuming that all observations @xmath114 are independent , the likelihood function is @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the parameter vector .",
    "this leads to the problem of solving the partial derivatives of the log - likelihood function @xmath117 with respect to @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath0 .",
    "however , obtaining explicit expressions for the ml estimators of the three parameters is difficult , making direct analytical solutions intractable , and one needs to use numerical optimization methods .",
    "taking into account the meaning of the variable @xmath2 , the mean value results to be equal to unity , i.e. @xmath120 . the latter relationship permits to express the parameter @xmath119 as a function of the parameters @xmath118 and @xmath0 , obtaining @xmath121^{\\alpha}. \\label{eq : equation37}\\ ] ] in this way , the problem to determine the values of the free parameters @xmath122 of the theory from the empirical data reduces to a two parameter @xmath123 fitting problem .",
    "therefore , to find the parameter values that give the most desirable fit , one can use the constrained maximum likelihood ( cml ) estimation method @xcite , which solves the general maximum log - likelihood problem of the form @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the number of observations , @xmath126 the weight assigned to each observation , @xmath127 the probability of @xmath128 given @xmath129 , subject to the non - linear equality constraint given by equation and bounds @xmath53 and @xmath12 . the cml procedure finds values for the parameters in @xmath129 such that the negative of @xmath130 is minimized using the sequential quadratic programming method @xcite as implemented , e.g. , in matlab^^ 7 .",
    "the @xmath0-generalized distribution was fitted to data on personal income derived from the 2003 wave of the u.s .",
    "panel study of income dynamics ( psid ) as released in the cross - national equivalent file ( cnef ) , a commercially available database compiled by researchers at cornell university @xcite .",
    "the 2003 psid - cnef data have a sampling of 7,822 household , and all calculations are based on the household post - government incomei.e . the income recorded after taxes and government transfersexpressed in nominal local currency unit and normalized to its empirical average given by @xmath131 usd .",
    "we have omitted from the sample of incomes those with zero and negative value , and this affected only a tiny fraction of the data .",
    "furthermore , incomes have been adjusted for differences in household size by dividing by the square root of the number of household members and weighted by the provided sampling weights @xcite .",
    "the best - fitting parameter values were determined using cml estimation as discussed in section [ sec : estimation ] .",
    "this resulted in the following estimates : @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "the very small value of the errors indicates that the parameters were precisely estimated , and the comparison between the observed and fitted probabilities in panels and of figure [ fig : figure1 ] suggests that the @xmath0-generalized distribution offers a great potential for describing the data over their whole range , from the low to medium income region through to the high income pareto power - law regime , including the intermediate region for which a clear deviation exists when two different curves are used .",
    "panel of the same figure depicts the data points for the empirical lorenz curve , i.e. @xmath135 , @xmath136 , superimposed by the theoretical curve @xmath137 given by equation with estimates replacing @xmath118 and @xmath0 as necessary .",
    "this formula is shown by the solid line in the plot , and fits the data exceptionally well .",
    "the plot also compares the empirical lorenz curve to the theoretical ones associated with the stretched exponential and pareto distributions , respectively given by    @xmath138    where @xmath139 is the lower regularized incomplete gamma function , and @xmath140    as one can easily recognize , these curves account for only a small part of the whole story .    in order to provide indirect checks on the validity of the parameter estimation , we have also calculated the sample values of the gini and theil indexes , obtained respectively as @xmath141 and @xmath142 , which return @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "the corresponding predictions from the analytical expressions equation and equation are @xmath145 and @xmath146 , and result completely covered by the 95% confidence intervals constructed around the empirical values .",
    "the accuracy of our distributional model was further examined by testing the hypothesis that the observed data follow a @xmath0-generalized distribution through the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) goodness - of - fit test statistic given by @xmath147 $ ] , @xmath136 . since in this case",
    "there is no asymptotic formula for calculating the @xmath148-value , we have reduced the problem to testing that the @xmath2 values have a standard exponential distribution ( i.e. , an exponential distribution with parameter equal to 1 ) by relating the function @xmath1 given by equation to the ordinary exponential function , namely @xmath149 , through the transformation @xmath150 , where the parameters are estimated from the data .",
    "thus the significance level in the upper tail is given approximatively by @xmath151 $ ] , with @xmath152 @xcite .",
    "the results are @xmath153 and @xmath154 , and state that the maximum distance between the empirical data and the theoretical model as assessed by the k - s statistic is so small that the @xmath148-value is not able to lead to rejection of the null hypothesis that the data may come from a @xmath0-generalized distribution at any of the usual significance levels ( 1% , 5% and 10% ) .",
    "the linear behavior emerging from the quantile - quantile ( q - q ) plot of the sample quantiles versus the corresponding quantiles of the fitted @xmath0-generalized distribution and its two limiting cases displayed in panel of figure [ fig : figure1 ] confirms the quantitative results obtained by hypothesis testing , as well as the fact that the stretched exponential and pareto distributions can give only a partial and incomplete description of the data .",
    "fitting a parametric model to income data can be a valuable and informative tool for distributional analysis . not only can one summarize the information contained in thousands of observations , but also useful information can be drawn directly from the estimated parameters .",
    "for example one could be interested in measuring income inequality , comparing different distributions or elaborating income redistribution policy : these concepts may be directly derived from parameters of a fitted distribution .",
    "starting from the pareto contribution , a wide variety of functional forms have been considered as possible models for the distribution of personal income by size , and other approaches can no doubt be suggested and deserve attention .    in this work",
    "we have proposed a new fitting function having its roots in the framework of the @xmath0-generalized statistical mechanics .",
    "the model has a bulk very close to the stretched exponential onewhich is recovered when the deformation parameter @xmath0 tends to zerowhile for high values of income its upper tail approaches a pareto distribution , thus being able to describe the data over the entire range .",
    "the performance of the distribution has been checked against real data on personal income for the united states in 2003 and has been found to fit remarkably well .",
    "the analysis of inequality performed in terms of its parameters reveals the merit of the new proposed distribution , and provides the basis for a fruitful interaction between the two fields of statistical mechanics and economics .",
