    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) emit an amount of isotropic - equivalent energy @xmath4 ergs in @xmath5-rays and x - rays in a few seconds and subsequently emit afterglows at x - ray ( costa et al . 1997 ) , optical ( van paradijs et al .",
    "1997 ) and radio bands ( frail et al . 1997 ) , which generally last days to months ( van paradijs , kouveliotou & wijers 2000 ) .",
    "the energetics of grbs , which is comparable to that of supernovae , and their rapid variability strongly suggest compact objects involving black holes , neutron stars and strange stars as the energy source for grbs .",
    "two popular models satisfying this energetics are explosive events of very massive stars , also named hypernovae ( paczyski 1998 ) or collapsars ( woosley 1993 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) , and mergers of neutron - star binaries ( eichler et al . 1989 : narayan , paczyski & piran 1992 ) .",
    "other possible models include phase transitions of neutron stars to strange stars ( cheng & dai 1996 ; dai & lu 1998a ; bombaci & datta 2000 ; wang et al .",
    "2000 ) , births of magnetars ( usov 1992 ; kluniak & ruderman 1998 ; spruit 1999 ; wheeler et al . 2000 ) , and implosions of supra - massive neutron stars ( vietri & stella 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "there has been considerable evidence linking the progenitors of grbs with massive stars .",
    "first , the sources of grbs with known redshifts lie within the optical radii and central regions of the host galaxies rather than far outside the disks of the galaxies ( bloom , kulkarni & djorgovski 2001 ) , which seem to rule out mergers of neutron - star binaries as the grb central engine .",
    "second , the brightness distribution of grbs is in agreement with the models in which the grb rate tracks the star formation rate over the past 15 billion years of cosmic history ( totani 1997 ; wijers et al .",
    "1998 ; kommers et al .",
    "third , the supernova sn1998bw with an unusual brightness was discovered in the error box of grb 980425 ( galama et al .",
    "1998 ) and a supernova - like component was detected in the afterglows from grb 980326 ( bloom et al .",
    "1999 ) and grb 970228 ( reichart 1999 ; galama et al .",
    "these detections provide the most direct evidence for the relation between grbs and a specific type of supernova . finally , the recent discovery of a transient absorption edge in the x - ray spectrum of grb 990705 ( amati et al .",
    "2000 ) and the observations of x - ray lines from grb 991216 ( piro et al .",
    "2000 ) and grb 000214 ( antonelli et al .",
    "2000 ) provide new evidence that grbs are related to the core collapse of massive stars .",
    "therefore , it has been widely believed that long duration grbs arise from the explosions of massive stars",
    ".    however , it seems theoretically difficult to understand the association of grbs with supernovae .",
    "this is because the rapid variability of grbs and their nonthermal spectra ( woods & loeb 1995 ) requires that the lorentz factor of a grb fireball be @xmath6 .",
    "this conclusion was also recently drawn by lithwick & sari ( 2001 ) , who derived the lower limits on @xmath7 due to annihilation of photons and scattering of photons by pair - created electrons and positrons .",
    "thus , the mass of the baryons contaminating the fireball must be less than @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand , too many baryons in the stellar envelope exist in the vicinity of the collapsing core in a massive star so that an ultrarelativistic fireball or jet forming during the collapse of the core is easy to become non - relativistic and then a bubble due to sideways expansion of the jet .",
    "a choked fireball ( or jet ) has been found numerically by macfadyen & woosley ( 1999 )    here we propose a scenario for the formation of grbs when a newborn neutron star accretes sufficient mass to undergo a phase transition to a strange star .",
    "cheng & dai ( 1996 ) , dai & lu ( 1998a ) , bombaci & datta ( 2000 ) , and wang et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have proposed the conversion from neutron stars to strange stars as a cosmological origin of grbs , but have not investigated the association of grbs with supernovae , the burst rate , and other interesting implications , e.g. , x - ray grbs .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss these questions .",
    "we assume the neutron star to move outward at an initial kick velocity of @xmath0 in the supernova ejecta . in section 2 , we analyze and calculate hypercritically accreted mass . in section 3 , we discuss implications for grbs . in order to produce a grb ,",
    "the phase transition is required to occur near the supernova front .",
    "we estimate the burst rate to be @xmath2 per year per galaxy .",
    "our model explains the grb - supernova connection . in section 4",
    ", we discuss other implications of the model .",
    "it is known that the core collapse of massive stars with @xmath9 produces type ii supernovae accompanying neutron stars whose initial mass is likely near the chrandrasehkar limit @xmath10 .",
    "the neutron stars are believed to have proper velocities .",
    "gunn & ostriker ( 1970 ) first recognized that galactic pulsars have much larger random velocities than their progenitor massive stars .",
    "modern observations and analysis on the proper motion of pulsars even give @xmath11 as an average 3-dimension velocity of neutron stars at birth ( e.g. , lyne & lorimer 1994 ; lorimer et al .",
    "1997 ; hansen & phinney 1997 ; cordes & chernoff 1998 ) , with possibly a significant population having velocities greater than @xmath12 .",
    "direct evidence for pulsar velocities @xmath13 is provided by observations of the bow shock produced by psr b@xmath14 in the interstellar medium ( cordes , romani & lundgren 1993 ) .",
    "the studies of the associations of neutron stars with supernova remnants have , in many cases , indicate large velocities ( e.g. , frail et al .",
    "in particular , the associations of soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) with supernova remnants imply that sgr @xmath15 and sgr @xmath16 have velocities of @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively where @xmath19 is the supernova remnant age , although the associations seem problematic .",
    "since many isolated pulsars have such large proper velocities , it appears necessary to invoke  natal kicks \" imparted to newborn neutron stars due to asymmetrical processes during supernovae .",
    "several mechanisms have been suggested for natal kicks : local hydrodynamical instabilities , neutrino - magnetic field driven asymmetry , local high - order gravity mode instabilities , and electromagnetic radiation of an off - centered rotating magnetic dipole ( for a recent review see lai 2000 ) .",
    "owing to these mechanisms , we assume a newborn neutron star to have an initial kick velocity of @xmath20 .",
    "the supernova explosion scenarios involve an outgoing shock wave that initially travels with speed of @xmath21 .",
    "however , when the initial outgoing shock wave enters hydrogen envelope , a deceleration of matter is formed ( woosely 1988 ) .",
    "this deceleration sharpens into a reverse shock . as a result",
    ", the final velocity of the supernova ejecta may be slowed down to @xmath22 . for simplicity , we assume that , since this time , the expanding supernova ejecta is spherical , its mass @xmath23 is constant with time",
    ", its density @xmath24 is uniform in space and decreases with time , and the supernova front radius @xmath25 increases at the fixed velocity of @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the density throughout is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 cm is the initial radius of the ejecta , and @xmath30 is the time after the explosion in units of @xmath31 s. since the ejecta is radiation dominated , its temperature @xmath32 scales as @xmath33 . from this scaling law",
    ", we have @xmath34k ( brown & weingartner 1994 ) , and the sound speed of the ejecta @xmath35    the initial outgoing supernova shock may produce a hole with radius of @xmath36 km ( bethe 1993 ) .",
    "so , no matter is accreted by the neutron star in a time of @xmath37 s where @xmath38 .",
    "subsequently , the neutron star will enters the supernova ejecta .",
    "we want to calculate the accretion rate as follows .",
    "if the effect of the neutron star magnetic field is neglected ( in fact , an initial strong magnetic field can rapidly decay due to hypercritical accretion , cf .",
    "geppert , page & zannias 1999 ) , the accretion rate of the neutron star at radius @xmath39 is given by the bondi - hoyle accretion formula , @xmath40 ^ 2+c_s^2\\}^{3/2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the schwarzschild radius of the neutron star with @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the velocity of the supernova matter ( not front ) at radius @xmath44 ( chevalier 1989 ) .",
    "here we have defined @xmath45 ^ 2+c_s^2\\}^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "we first estimate the accreted mass . to do this",
    ", @xmath46 is assumed to be approximately constant .",
    "thus , at early times @xmath47 , the accretion rate is approximated by @xmath48 at late times @xmath49 , the accretion rate becomes @xmath50 this accretion rate is at least ten orders of magnitude larger than the eddington accretion rate for a solar - mass star .",
    "the gravitational energy released during such a hypercritical accretion is carried away by neutrinos .",
    "it is neutrino emission that allows accretion of the star at a much higher rate than the eddington rate . from simple analytical arguments , chevalier ( 1989 ) and",
    "brown & weingartner ( 1994 ) estimated a lower limit to steady neutron star accretion with neutrino losses assuming spherical symmetry : @xmath51 .",
    "our estimated accretion rate exceeds @xmath52 for @xmath53 s. we estimate the accreted mass @xmath54 where equation ( 7 ) is obtained by substituting equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) into ( 6 ) .",
    "next , we numerically calculate equation ( 6 ) .",
    "figure 1 presents the accreted mass as a function of time .",
    "it can be seen from this figure that the neutron star will be able to accrete considerable matter ( with mass of @xmath55 ) before its conversion to a strange star .",
    "since conversion of neutron stars to strange stars was suggested as a possible origin of cosmological grbs by cheng & dai ( 1996 ) , resulting rotating strange stars with strong magnetic fields have been proposed to explain the observed features of some grb afterglows by some authors ( dai & lu 1998a , 1998b , 2000 , 2001 ; zhang & mszros 2001 ) .",
    "bodmer ( 1971 ) and witten ( 1984 ) conjectured that strange quark matter may be the true ground state of hadrons .",
    "detailed calculations based on the zero - temperature thermodynamics of strange matter show that strange matter is indeed more stable than @xmath56fe for a wide range of the parameters of the mit bag model ( farhi & jaffe 1984 ) .",
    "if this hypothesis is true , strange stars as a kind of compact object may exist in the universe .",
    "how are strange stars produced ?",
    "one natural way is direct collapse of the core of a massive star to a strange star .",
    "if this way is possible , a binary including a strange star and a more massive compact object imaginably exists . during the coalescence of such a binary ,",
    "the strange star is disrupted by its companion . as a result",
    ", the entire galaxy can be comtaminated and all  neutron stars \" become strange stars ( madsen 1988 ; caldwell & friedman 1991 ; kluniak 1994 ) , which is referred to as the madsen - caldwell - friedman ( mcf ) effect .",
    "this effect conflicts with the post - glitch behavior of pulsars , which is well described by the neutron - superfluid vortex creep theory , and current strange star models can not explain the observed pulsar glitches ( alpar 1987 ; alpar , pines & cheng 1990 ) .",
    "another way to produce strange stars is that a neutron star in a low - mass x - ray binary accretes sufficient mass to undergo a phase transition to a strange star ( cheng & dai 1996 ) .",
    "this way can avoid the mcf effect . in this paper",
    ", we propose a third way to produce strange stars , i.e. , a newborn  unbound \" neutron star with a kick velocity of @xmath57 will catch up with the outgoing supernova ejecta and will accrete considerable matter so that the neutron star can convert to a strange star ( see section 2 ) .",
    "if such a rapidly moving neutron star arises from the supernova explosion of a massive star in a binary , the neutron star must be able to escape from the binary system because of its too large kick velocity , and thus the resulting strange star will have no companion . if a newborn neutron star does not have an enough large proper velocity to catch up with the supernova ejecta , the star may accrete only a mass of @xmath58 ( chevalier 1989 ) so that it can not undergo a phase transition to become a strange star .",
    "therefore , the third way can also avoid the mcf effect .",
    "cheng & dai ( 1998 , 2001 ) have argued that such a strange star , if it has a strong magnetic field and a superconducting core , may produce soft gamma - ray repeaters in an age of @xmath59 yrs .",
    "here we discuss its implications for grbs .",
    "the conversion of a neutron star to a strange star requires the formation of a strange matter seed , which is produced through the deconfinement of neutron matter at a density of @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 is the saturation nuclear matter density ) ( baym 1991 ) , much larger than the central density of a @xmath62 neutron star with a moderately stiff to stiff equation of state ( as implied by some astrophysical processes , cf .",
    "dai & lu 1998a ) . to reach the deconfinement density ,",
    "cheng & dai ( 1996 ) suggested , a @xmath62 neutron star with a moderately stiff to stiff equation of state should accrete matter with mass of @xmath63 before its phase transition to a strange star .",
    "once the accreted mass is @xmath64 , a strange matter seed may appear in the core of the neutron star , and subsequently the strange matter will begin to swallow its surrounding neutron matter in a hydrodynamically unstable mode ( detonation ) .",
    "thus , the neutron star will convert to a strange star in a timescale of the order of 0.1 ms .",
    "the phase transition includes two processes : ( 1 ) the neutron matter converts to two - flavor quark matter , and ( 2 ) the two - flavor quark matter converts to strange ( three - flavor ) quark matter .",
    "the latter process can release the energy per baryon of a few tens of mev in a timescale of @xmath65 s ( dai et al .",
    "owing to this process , the resulting strange star will be as hot as a few @xmath66 k. how is the energy release due to the phase transition deposited ?",
    "one mechanism for the energy deposition is the neutrino - antineutrino annihilation process @xmath67 and the neutrino absorption processes @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( in the crust ) .",
    "another mechanism is the creation of electron / positron pairs in an extremely strong strong electric field at the quark surface ( usov 1998 , 2001 ) .",
    "the total energy deposition for these two mechanisms , @xmath70 , is a few @xmath1 ergs , which will inevitably lead to a fireball composed of @xmath5 and electron / positron pairs polluted by a small number of baryons .",
    "the contaminating baryon mass is up to the crustal mass of the strange star , @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , the resulting fireball should be accelerated to an ultra - relativistic phase with lorentz factor of @xmath72 .",
    "the newborn strange star is surrounded by the supernova ejecta matter .",
    "if the sn ejecta mass in the solid angle of @xmath73 between the star and the sn front , @xmath74 , greatly exceeds @xmath75 , the resulting fireball can not still be accelerated to ultra - relativistic .",
    "an ultra - relativistic fireball also requires @xmath76 .",
    "we assume that @xmath77 is the minimum distance of the initial site of the strange star to the supernova front .",
    "assuming @xmath78 , we estimate the ratio of @xmath74 to the total sn ejecta mass @xmath79 : @xmath80 since @xmath81 , we have @xmath82 which further requires @xmath83 because the number of the neutron stars with @xmath84 is @xmath85 per galaxy in the hubble time ( lorimer et al . 1997 ) , the number of the strange stars that can produce grbs are estimated to be @xmath86 per galaxy in the hubble time , where we have assumed that the number distribution of the neutron stars is uniform in the velocity space for @xmath87 .",
    "the burst rate in our model is approximated by @xmath88 this rate is enough to explain the observed grb rate , @xmath89",
    "/yr / galaxy .",
    "the latter rate has been estimated due to the evidence that the grb rate is proportional to the star formation rate ( totani 1997 ; wijers et al .",
    "1998 ; kommers et al .",
    "2000 ) .    since the accreted mass @xmath90",
    ", accretion of the pre - conversion neutron star should not influence its velocity significantly , we have an approximate relation : @xmath91 , and the ejecta radius @xmath92 .",
    "thus , the expansion timescale of the sn ejecta is @xmath93 this implies that the sn explosion might occur a few days before a grb .",
    "our model has several implications .",
    "first , it can clearly explain the association of grbs with a special kind of supernova .",
    "the phase transition of the neutron star to a strange star is almost isotropic ; about one half of the energy release will result in an ultra - relativistic fireball with baryon contamination of @xmath94 , and another half will be absorbed by the sn ejecta because the photon - electron scattering depth in the sn ejecta @xmath95r\\sim 10 ^ 5 \\gg 1 $ ] .",
    "so , the phase transition discussed here may also give rise to a hypernova with a high amount of explosive energy ( @xmath96 ergs ) and a bright optical luminosity .",
    "a hypernova - like component has been observed in several cases , e.g. , sn 1998bw ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ) , grb 980326 ( bloom et al . 1999 ) and grb 970228 ( reichart 1999 ; galama et al",
    "second , the observed breaks in the light curves of some optical afterglows are argued to be due to sideways expansion of collimated fireballs ( rhoads 1999 ; sari , piran & halpern 1999 ) . however ,",
    "this argument is still now a matter of considerable theoretical debate ( moderski , sikora & bulik 2000 ; wei & lu 2000 ) .",
    "dai & lu ( 1999 , 2000 ) have proposed the evolution of a fireball to the non - relativistic regime in a dense medium as an alternative explanation for these observed breaks .",
    "our present model meets the second explanation .",
    "third , if the phase transition occurs at @xmath97 , then the resulting fireball has the loading baryon mass of @xmath98 , and its lorentz factor should be @xmath99 .",
    "although this fireball can not produce a classical grb due to its low lorentz factor , it may result in a weak grb like grb 980425 or an x - ray grb ( or called an x - ray flash ) like grb 991106 observed by bepposax ( search http://www.ias.rm.cnr.it/ias-home/sax/xraygrb.html ) .",
    "we predict that the rate of such a kind of grb is @xmath100 per year per galaxy .",
    "finally , the phase transition occurs more possibly at @xmath101 .",
    "all the energy release will be absorbed by the sn ejecta , and the resulting fireball is non - relativistic but much more energetic than a normal supernova .",
    "this fireball may only behave as a hypernova but not emit a grb or even an x - ray grb .    in summary",
    ", we have presented a new model for grbs with small baryon contamination .",
    "a key point of our model is that a newborn neutron star with an initial kick velocity of @xmath0 will catch up with the outgoing supernova ejecta , and accrete matter at a hypercritical rate . once the stellar mass increases to some critical mass",
    ", the neutron star will undergo a phase transition to a strange star , resulting in an energy release of a few @xmath1 ergs .",
    "the phase transition may produce a grb when it occurs just near the sn front .",
    "the burst rate is @xmath2 per year per galaxy .",
    "in addition , if the phase transition occurs in the interior of the sn ejecta , it may result in an x - ray grb observed by bepposax or only a burstless hypernova explosion .    in this paper",
    ", we have discussed one result for accreting high - velocity neutron stars in supernovae , i.e. , the conversion to strange stars as an origin of grbs . another result for accreting neutron stars",
    "is the collapse to black holes when the stellar mass reaches the maximum mass .",
    "if the pre - collapse neutron stars are millisecond pulsars , the resulting black holes must be rapidly rotating . as suggested by vietri & stella ( 1998 )",
    ", such black holes may produce grbs by extracting their rotational energy or tapping the binding energy of the disk - black hole system .",

    "<S> we present a new model for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) that are not only associated with supernovae but also have small baryon contamination . in this model , we assume a newborn neutron star to move outward at a kick velocity of @xmath0 in the supernova ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> we find that such a neutron star still hypercritically accretes its surrounding supernova matter . once the stellar mass increases to some critical mass </S>",
    "<S> , the neutron star will undergo a phase transition to become a strange star , leading to an energy release of a few @xmath1 ergs . </S>",
    "<S> the phase transition , if possibly occuring just near the supernova front , will first result in an ultra - relativistic fireball and then a grb . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a plausible explanation for the grb - supernova association . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the burst rate to be @xmath2 per year per galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> our model also predicts other possiblities . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if the resulting fireballs have a lorentz factor of the order of a few , they will produce x - ray grbs observed by bepposax . </S>",
    "<S> we find the rate of such bursts to be @xmath3 per year per galaxy . </S>"
