    "<S> the effects of electron doping and phonon vibrations on the magnetic properties of monolayer and bilayer fese epitaxial films on srtio@xmath0 have been studied , respectively , using first - principles calculations with van der waals correction . for monolayer </S>",
    "<S> fese epitaxial film , the combined effect of electron doping and phonon vibrations readily leads to magnetic frustration between the collinear antiferromagnetic state and the checkerboard antiferromagnetic nel state . for bilayer </S>",
    "<S> fese epitaxial film , such magnetic frustration is much more easily induced by electron doping in its bottom layer than its top layer . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying physics is that the doped electrons are accumulated at the interface between the fese layers and the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> these results are consistent with existing experimental studies . </S>"
