    "the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particles has been highly successful in describing the observed and measured phenomena .",
    "it contains , however , an unexplored sector , namely , the higgs sector .",
    "the sm also has several problems , one of which is the fermion mass hierarchy problem , especially the top quark having a much larger mass than all other quarks .    in the t2hdm which was first suggested by das and kao @xcite as an extension to the sm , and which can be viewed as a low - energy parametrization of a more fundamental theory , the top quark receives a special status by a particular yukawa structure which endows the top quark with a naturally large mass , while at the same time giving rise to potentially large fcnc couplings in the up - quark sector .",
    "such new fcnc interactions in the up - quark sector may drive fcnc decays such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 that we will consider in this paper .",
    "previous studies @xcite have shown that the @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , could reach up to @xmath6 in the 2hdm type ii and in the mssm , and about @xmath7 in the 2hdm type i. in addition , the fcnc top decays @xmath8 can range between @xmath9 depending on the underlying higgs sector . in order to give a feeling of the maximal values expected for the br s of fcnc",
