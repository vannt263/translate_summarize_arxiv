    "exploring the behaviour of systems is an old matter of interest for researchers on dynamical systems @xcite@xcite .",
    "it is varies from integrable to chaos ; see for example @xcite .",
    "the question whether a system is integrable or not is one of the most interested matters @xcite . for autonomous ordinary differential equations , integrability means that the equation is solvable by quadratures .",
    "complete integrability is one of the most simple and useful integrabilities for flows .",
    "it is based on the fact that we can solve any one dimensional flows .",
    "note that , in the case of hamiltonian flows , liouville s integrability , instead of complete integrability , is frequently used because of its topological aspect .",
    "here we recall the concept of complete integrability . for @xmath0th order autonomous ordinary differential equations",
    ", we say that a system is completely integrable if there exist @xmath1 conserved quantities and they are functionally independent . functionally independent conserved quantities are called first integrals , since their values arise as integral constants in the general solution .    for autonomous ordinary difference equations ,",
    "however , complete integrability can not be worked on since we can not solve one dimensional maps in general .",
    "the map @xmath2\\to [ 0,1]$ ] defined as @xmath3 , @xmath4 is such a typical example .",
    "therefore integrability for autonomous ordinary difference equations , or maps , is more complicated than flows .",
    "note that even in the case of one dimensional maps with invertibility , the dynamics may not be solvable .",
    "indeed , many types of interval exchange transformations with generic parameters seem not to be solvable since they have weak mixing property @xcite .",
    "while for partial difference equations , researches of intgegrability for the systems which correspond to soliton equations were developed in these two decades by many researchers ; see for example @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we give a sufficient condition that a symplectic difference equation with one degree of freedom , which are naturally equipped with invertibility , is solvable by quadratures .",
    "more precisely , for a symplectic difference equation @xmath5 with one degree of freedom , if the system has a conserved quantity @xmath6 and there exists an invariant finite borel measure @xmath7 on each level set @xmath8 , then the system is solvable by quadratures .",
    "this integrability can be regarded as an analogue of complete integrability for flows .    for difference equations with singularities ,",
    "singularity confinement test @xcite is available for checking whether the system has sufficiently many conserved quantities . note that singularity confinement test gives us neither sufficient nor necessary condition to have conserved quantities ; see @xcite for non - sufficiency and see the example presented in next section for non - necessarity ,",
    "nevertheless , many difference equations with conserved quantities pass this test .    in the cases of birational maps ,",
    "algebraic entropy @xcite is useful to judge whether a map has conserved quantities .",
    "this method says that if algebraic entropy @xmath9 , the system is integrable .",
    "note that this method is related to arnold s complexity @xcite .",
    "both in singularity confinement test and in algebraic entropy method , the discussion about the solvability by quadratures is lacked . in this paper , a sufficient condition that symplectic difference equations can be solved by quadratures",
    "is presented through a geometrical approach .",
    "that is , we shed a light to the geometrical aspects of integrability of symplectic maps .    in the rest of this paper , we use the word  integrability \" as the meaning of that the system is solvable by quadratures both for maps and for flows .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", the concept of  onset linearization \" is proposed through a typical example . in section 3 ,",
    "the construction of invariant measure on each level set is presented , and then , we can see the connection between the dynamics on each level set and interval exchange transformations under some assumptions . in section 4 , the main theorems are stated .",
    "an example whose integrability can be proven by the main theorems is presented in appendix .",
    "linearizability is one of the most simple integrabilities both for flows and for maps .",
    "consider @xmath10th order autonomous difference equations @xmath11 if there exists a transformation @xmath12(,or @xmath13 ) such that the difference equation ( [ general ] ) is rewritten as a linear difference equation @xmath14 for new variable @xmath15 , then we say that the original difference equation ( [ general ] ) is linearizable .",
    "the concept of linearizability works on flows , too .",
    "if a map , or a flow , is linearizable , its integrability is obvious , so linearizability is a sufficient condition that a system is integrable .",
    "but it is nt a necessary condition , and moreover , there exist many examples which is integrable but is not linearizable .",
    "such a typical eample is the dynamics of pendulum moving on a perpendicular plane .",
    "this system has two fixed points on its cylindrical phase space , one is elliptic and the other is hyperbolic . around the elliptic fixed point ,",
    "the orbits do nt have isochronism property which linear oscillator has .",
    "isochronism property is conserved under variable transformations , so this system is nt linearizable .",
    "the same situation is occurred for maps .",
    "consider the difference equation @xmath16 this system has a conserved quantity @xmath17 on its phase space @xmath18 , and moreover , this system has another conserved quantity @xmath19 for sub dynamics @xmath20 . here @xmath21 is the map defined by ( [ linearizable ] ) and @xmath22 means @xmath23 . the difference equation ( [ linearizable ] )",
    "can be partially linearizable by @xmath24 as follows ; @xmath25 where the value of @xmath24 is invariant under the dynamics of the partially linearized difference equations ( [ linearize ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath24 varies as initial value varies , so the linearized equations ( [ linearize ] ) depends on the level set on which initial value is .",
    "let us call the partially linearizablity  _ onset linearizability _ \" .    for such initial values",
    "@xmath26 as @xmath27 , the system ( [ linearize ] ) of difference equations breaks down .",
    "this breaking down corresponds to the breaking down of ( [ linearizable ] ) derived from @xmath28 .    in this system",
    "the singularity @xmath29 can not be confined for any step .",
    "in fact , for initial value @xmath30 , we can calculate @xmath31 by the second equation of ( [ linearize ] ) .      to describe the general definition of  onset linearizability \" , we return to the @xmath10th order difference equation ( [ general ] ) .",
    "suppose that ( [ general ] ) has @xmath32 functionally independent conserved quantities @xmath33 , @xmath34",
    ". then its level sets @xmath35 on which a given initial value @xmath36 exists are labeled by the set @xmath37 of @xmath32 values @xmath38 .",
    "if there exists a variable transformation @xmath39 and the difference equation ( [ general ] ) is deformed to a linear difference equation @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a linear function with respect to each @xmath42 , then we say that the difference equation ( [ general ] ) is directly onset linearizable .    and",
    ", in the same assumptions , if there exists a sub dynamics @xmath43 of ( [ general ] ) and it is onset linearizable , then we say that the difference equation ( [ general ] ) is indirectly onset linearizable . here",
    "@xmath44 is a collection of functions , @xmath45 if @xmath46 , the sub dynamics ( [ indirectly ] ) is equivalent to ( [ general ] ) . while if @xmath47 , informations of some sequences are lost .",
    "for example , if @xmath48 and @xmath49 , informations of @xmath50 are lost for the pair of initial value @xmath51 . but these lost sequences can be given by finite iterations , namely , @xmath52 is immediately given from @xmath53 by ( [ general ] ) .",
    "so , indirectly onset linearizability asserts that the original dynamics is integrable .    in the case of ( [ linearizable ] ) ,",
    "the difference equation is indirectly onset linearizable with @xmath48 and @xmath54 .",
    "consider one degree of freedom symplectic difference equation @xmath55 this difference equation is equivalent to the system of difference equations @xmath56 in this and next sections , we use the notation ( [ symplectic2 ] ) instead of ( [ symplectic1 ] ) because of the easiness of description .",
    "difference equations of this type have invertibility and symplectic property at regular points on their phase spaces .",
    "therefore , the dynamics preserves phase volume , namely , the measure @xmath57 is invariant .",
    "if ( [ symplectic2 ] ) has a conserved quantity @xmath58 , then there exists the restricted invariant measure @xmath59 on each level set @xmath8 because of its symplectic property . here",
    "@xmath60 and @xmath61 mean derivatives of @xmath62 with respect to @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively , and @xmath65 is a variable defined as the arc - length of the curve @xmath8 .",
    "in the same assumptions as previous section , we can conclude that , for almost every level set @xmath66 , if the restricted invariant measure ( [ invmeas ] ) is finite , then the restricted dynamics @xmath67 of ( [ symplectic2 ] ) is isomorphic ( mod 0 ) to an interval exchange transfomation . here ",
    "isomorphic ( mod 0 ) \" measns  measure theoretically isomorphic \" .",
    "furthermore , if the function @xmath68 of ( [ symplectic2 ] ) is continuous or rational , the interval exchange transformations are integrable .    as the preparation to state the main theorem ,",
    "we recall the notion of interval exchange transformations @xcite .",
    "interval exchange transformations is a class of piecewise linear maps on unit ( or a finite ) interval . for a piecewise linear map ,",
    "if the map is one - to - one , onto and every inclination is equal to @xmath69 , then we say that the piecewise linear map is an _ interval exchange transformation _ , or simply , an _ interval exchange_.    every interval exchange has the invariant measure @xmath70 and orientability .",
    "note that , for any one dimensional orientable and bijective maps , if a map has a finite borel invariant measure and the map is a.e.- continuous with respect to the measure , then there exists an interval exchange which is isomorphic ( mod 0 ) to the map .",
    "discrete rotations on unit interval , which are integrable , are the typical examples of interval exchanges .",
    "note that , to the best of the author s knowledge , it is not known whether there are non - integrable interval exchanges , however there exist interval exchanges with weak mixing property @xcite , which seem to be non - integrable .",
    "for the symplectic difference equations ( [ symplectic2 ] ) , if there exists a first integral @xmath58 and the restricted invariant measure ( [ invmeas ] ) on a generic level set @xmath8 is finite , then there exists an one - to - one , onto map @xmath71 acting on unit interval @xmath72 and preserving the lebesgue measure @xmath73 , and @xmath67 is isomorphic ( mod 0 ) to @xmath71 .    here a generic level set means the level set on which the almost every point is not the first type singular point and every point is not the second type singular point .",
    "here the first type singular point is the singular point derived from @xmath68 s singularities , where the absence of this type of singularity for a.e.- point guarantees one - to - one , onto properties of @xmath67 for a.e.- point .",
    "the second one is the singular point on which the absolute value @xmath74 vanishes , where the absence of this type of singularity , together with the absence of the other , makes @xmath67 to be orientable and a.e.- one - to - one and onto .",
    "note that the orientability of @xmath75 of ( [ symplectic2 ] ) is directly derived from symplectic property of ( [ symplectic2 ] ) , that is , we choose the orientation ( cotangent vector ) @xmath76 on @xmath8 by , for example , @xmath77 here the operator @xmath78 means outer product .    from the above discussions it is clear that , +   + * theorem 4.1 * _ if a symplectic map ( [ symplectic2 ] ) has a first integral @xmath58 and the restricted invariant measure ( [ invmeas ] ) of a generic level set @xmath8 is finite , then the restricted dynamics @xmath67 is isomorphic ( mod 0 ) to an interval exchange , _ +   + where a generic level set was already explained in this section .",
    "+ moreover , if the function @xmath79 of ( [ symplectic2 ] ) is continuous or rational , we can conclude that , +   + * theorem 4.2 * _ in the same assumptions as in theorem 4.1 , if @xmath79 is continuous or rational , then the interval exchange is integrable . _",
    "+   + to prove the theorem 4.2 , first we consider the case that @xmath79 is continuous .",
    "in such cases , the restricted dynamics @xmath67 is continuous , too . the case that the level set @xmath8 is connected is the simplest case of these , and , in this case , @xmath67 could nt have any proper rifts . here  proper rift \" is a rift which may not be lost in successive iterations . while the discrete rotations are the only cases of the interval exchanges which have no proper rifts .",
    "so , the continuous map @xmath67 for connected @xmath8 is isomorphic to a discrete rotation , which is integrable .",
    "+ while if @xmath8 is decomposed to some connected components @xmath80 , @xmath81 , ( we ignore any measureless connected component , namely , @xmath82 for every @xmath83 , ) then the image of each @xmath80 is also connected because of the continuity of @xmath67 .",
    "thus , there exists the indices @xmath84 for each @xmath83 such that @xmath85 .",
    "the same discussion can be performed for the inverse map @xmath86 since the continuity of @xmath79 makes @xmath86 continuous , too .",
    "thus , we can get the relation @xmath87 , which is equivalent to @xmath88 .",
    "together with the above relation , we can get the relation @xmath89 . since the restricted invariant measure ( [ invmeas ] ) is finite , there",
    "exist finite numbers @xmath90 for all indices @xmath83 such that @xmath91 .",
    "if we denote @xmath92 as the @xmath90 iterations of @xmath93 restricted on @xmath80 , then all these maps are continuous and all these domains @xmath80 are connected .",
    "thus , the @xmath92 for every @xmath83 is isomorphic to a discrete rotation .",
    "from the integrability of @xmath92 , we can get the conclusion that @xmath94 is integrable .",
    "indeed , we can take the decomposition @xmath95 , where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the quotient and the remainder of @xmath98 , respectively , therefore , the maps @xmath94 are solvable by quadratures and finite ( , bounded above by @xmath99 , ) iterations , that is , are solvable by quadratures .",
    "second , we consider the other case , namely , the case that @xmath79 is rational . in such cases ,",
    "the continuity of @xmath67 breaks down around the first type singular points . while the neighborhood of every first type singular point returns back to a neighborhood of a finite point by successive iterations since the invariant measure ( [ invmeas ] ) is finite .",
    "namely , the difference equations pass the singularity confinement test in some step .",
    "one may think that , for some singular point , the corresponding point which the singular point _ returns back _ to and the number of steps for the right limit can be different from for the left limit .",
    "but actually , such bad situations can not occur since @xmath79 is rational .",
    "let @xmath100 be a first type singular point on @xmath8 and @xmath101 and @xmath102 be the left and right limit of @xmath100 , respectively , and @xmath103 be the number of steps at which neighborhood of @xmath100 returns back to a finite region .",
    "although every element of the sequences @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , diverges to infinite point , we can regard that @xmath104 and @xmath105 for any fixed @xmath0 are connected to each other , with no paradoxes .",
    "then the topology of the lavel set @xmath8 is changed to that the map @xmath67 is continuous on @xmath8 for new topology .",
    "therefore , we can perform the same discussion that we performed for continuous @xmath79 , and thus , we can conclude that the corresponding interval exchanges are integrable .",
    "the proof of theorem 4.2 is finished .    and moreover , +   + * corollary 4.3 * _ under the same assumptions as in theorem 4.2",
    ", the map is onset linearizable to an elliptic equations . _ +   + an example of difference equations whose integrability and linearizability are proved by the result stated in this section is presented in appendix .",
    "in this paper , we treat a class of two dimensional difference equations , that is , symplectic difference equations with one degree of freedom .",
    "we get sufficient conditions that such a difference equation can be reduced to interval exchange ( theorem 4.1 ) , and that such a difference equation is integrable ( theorem 4.2 ) .",
    "note that , in this paper , we adopt the concept that the system can be solved by quadratures as the definition of integrability .",
    "we also partially reveal when singularity confinement test works as the indicator of integrability .",
    "the result is naturally extended to higher degrees as the analogue of complete integrability .",
    "but , how we should extend to higher order as the analogue of liouville - arnold s integrability is not so clear .",
    "this is one of the future s assignments .",
    "the advantage of the reduction for a symplectic map to an interval exchange is easiness to treat . if the map ( [ symplectic2 ] ) for an irrational @xmath79 passes to the assumptions in theorem 4.1 , then the @xmath67 is isomorphic ( mod 0 ) to an interval exchange , which is expected to have singular continuous spectrum . to find",
    "such an example is also one of the future s assignments .",

    "tetsuro konishi for useful discussion and helpful advices .",
    "in this section , an example whose integrability is proven by the main theorems is presented .",
    "its onset linearizability is explained , too .    consider a system of symplectic difference equations @xmath107 this system has a conserved quantity @xmath108",
    "; see fig.[figa ] .    ) on its phase space.,width=302,height=302 ]    therefore , the invariant measure @xmath109 restricted on @xmath110 is finite . here",
    "the third and forth equalities is calculated with the relation @xmath111 on the level set .",
    "thus , the the normalized invariant measure @xmath112 is given as @xmath113 where , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are @xmath116 and @xmath117 respectively .",
    "every level set is composed of six curves @xmath118 @xmath119 @xmath120 @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123 then , we define a map @xmath124 from the curve @xmath8 to @xmath72 as follows : first , set the image of the tail @xmath125 of @xmath126 by @xmath124 to be @xmath127 , and the image of any other point @xmath128 to be @xmath129 , which is the distance from @xmath125 to @xmath130 measured by the metric ( [ ex1inv2 ] ) .",
    "then the head @xmath131 of @xmath126 is mapped to @xmath132 .",
    "next , set the image of the tail of the next @xmath133 , namely @xmath134 of @xmath135 , to be @xmath132 , and the image of any other point @xmath136 to be @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the distance from the tail of @xmath135 to @xmath130 .",
    "and so on . then",
    ", the head of @xmath139 , or the tail of @xmath140 , is mapped to @xmath141 , and the head of @xmath142 is mapped to @xmath141 .",
    "the interval exchange @xmath143 is represented at fig.[figb ] .    ) . here",
    "@xmath144 is defined as @xmath145,width=226,height=226 ]    here @xmath146 is the map defined by ( [ ex1 ] ) . pay your attention to that the interval exchange @xmath93 depends on @xmath147 , because @xmath148 and @xmath149 depend on @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath150 , for example , every point on this level set is periodic point with period @xmath151 . more generally , if @xmath114 and @xmath115 are rationally dependent , every point on this level set is periodic point with same period , while if the values of @xmath114 and @xmath115 are rationally independent , all points on this level set are not periodic .",
    "@xmath152 and @xmath153 are the only isolated periodic ( fixed ) points of the system ( [ ex1 ] ) .",
    "the interval exchange @xmath154 has the property of discrete rotations , that is , @xmath22 on @xmath155 or @xmath156 is a discrete rotation .",
    "its winding number is @xmath157 .",
    "therefore we can solve the dynamics of @xmath93 as @xmath158 @xmath159    moreover , this result says that the system ( [ ex1 ] ) is indirectly onset linearizable .",
    "if we use new coordinate @xmath160 , @xmath161 , we can describe the onset dynamics as @xmath162 as the notations in section 2 , this indirectly onset linearization is carried out with @xmath48 , @xmath54 .",
