    "in the past decade , quantum transport phenomena in open quantum dots has received much attention .",
    "@xcite the open quantum dot , consisting of a submicron sized cavity connecting via point contact leads to two end - electrodes , has become an important device for the investigation of phase coherent processes and their various mechanisms .",
    "the size of the dot and the width of the leads can be controlled by split - gates . in high electron mobility samples , and at sufficient low temperatures ,",
    "the phase coherent length may well exceed the dimension of the device , allowing electrons to remain coherent while traversing the dot .",
    "meanwhile , there are growing interest in the high - frequency responses of mesoscopic nanostructures .",
    "the time - modulated fields invoked are either high - frequency electromagnetic fields@xcite or time - modulated potentials .",
    "@xcite a number of theoretical approaches have been developed to explore quantum transport under such time - modulated fields .",
    "wkb approximation was employed in the study of photovoltaic effect  @xcite and photon - assisted quantum transport .",
    "@xcite a mode - matching method was developed for delta - profile  @xcite as well as finite - range profile time - modulated potentials .",
    "@xcite extension of this method to time - dependent field , represented by a vector potential @xmath2 , was carried out by either neglecting  @xcite or including  @xcite the contribution of @xmath3 term .",
    "this mode - matching method was further extended to accommodate spatial inhomogeneity .",
    "the time - modulated field is divided into piece - wise potentials connected by either transfer matrices  @xcite or scattering matrices .",
    "@xcite recently , this latter approach has been applied to study a mechanism of nonadiabatic quantum pumping .",
    "@xcite this pumping mechanism is due to resonances resulted from coherent inelastic scattering that requires simultaneous changes in both the energy and momentum of the traversing electron , by respectively , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 characterize , respectively , the temporal and the spatial variation of the modulation field .",
    "encouraged by the success of the time - modulated mode - matching method , we opt to apply the method to the very interesting case of time - modulated quantum dots .    in the absence of a time - modulated field ,",
    "transmission of electrons through a quantum dot already shows resonance structures . for the case of a weakly coupled dot  dot in which electrons are separated from the connecting leads by tunneling barriers  the resonance peaks in the transmission are due to the alignment of the incident electron energy with the quasi - bound - state ( qbs ) levels in the dot .",
    "@xcite interestingly , qbss of similar nature still exist in the case of an open quantum dot  where tunneling barriers between the dot and the lead are absent .",
    "these qbss , again , give rise to resonances in the transmission .",
    "however , dip structures , rather than peaks , become the signatures for the resonances .    when acted upon by a time - modulated potential , the transmission of a weakly - coupled dot was found to exhibit additional resonance peaks : peaks associated with ac sidebands .",
    "@xcite this is due to the alignment , albeit shifted by @xmath8 , of the incident electron energy with the qbs levels in the dot .",
    "other features found in a time - modulated weakly coupled dot are photon - assisted tunneling ,  @xcite electron pumps ,  @xcite and phase breaking .",
    "@xcite    recently , an open quantum dot , acted upon by a transversely polarized electromagnetic field , and connected adiabatically to the connecting leads , has been considered .",
    "@xcite the adiabatic dot - lead connections allow an electron mode in the lead to evolve into an electron mode in the dot .",
    "thus , situations occur when an electron in the lower mode in the dot can exit the dot without reflection , while an electron at the same energy , but in a higher mode in the dot , is trapped inside it . as such , inter - mode transitions between the above two modes in the dot , as induced by the transversely polarized electromagnetic field ,",
    "were found to lead to giant mesoscopic conductance fluctuations  @xcite and microwave - induced resonant blocking in a mesoscopic channel .",
    "@xcite    the adiabaticity of the dot - lead connection holds for large quantum dots .",
    "but as the sizes of the open quantum dot shrink and approach the realm of the fermi wavelength , the dot - lead connections could no longer remain adiabatic .",
    "more recent experimental findings in dc transport in open quantum dots  that transport occurs through individual eigenstates of the corresponding closed dot ;  @xcite and that the conductance oscillations correlate to the recurrence of specific groups of wave function scars in the dot  @xcite  indicate unequivocally that inter - mode scattering , and backscattering are present , respectively , at the dot - lead connections .",
    "the effect of impurity should play no role here because of the high mobility of the sample used in these experiments .",
    "therefore , in this work , we consider a time - modulated open quantum dot with non - adiabatic dot - lead connections .",
    "we calculate the dc conductance @xmath0 of a time - modulated open quantum dot and the dwell time @xmath9 of the traversing electron in the dot .",
    "we have analyzed the resonance structures in @xmath0 associated with the time - modulation and are able to categorize them according to their respective dynamical processes involved .",
    "of these three resonance types , one is analogous to that found in time - modulated weakly coupled dots .",
    "it is associated with the alignment of the incident electron energy with that of the ac sidebands of the qbss inside the open dot .",
    "the second type is associated with the coherent inelastic scattering of the traversing electron into the true bound state in the open dot  bound state which energy is lower than the threshold energy of the leads .",
    "the third type of resonance structures is most unexpected .",
    "it is associated with the coherent inelastic scattering of the traversing electron into the qbs in the lead  with energy just beneath the threshold energy of the lead .",
    "also , from the dwell time @xmath9 , we estimate the number of scatterings that occur in the dot as the resonance structures establish themselves . in all , our results demonstrate the potential of establishing quantum transport as a spectroscopic probe for the qbss and true bound states in the open dot  and possibly in other mesoscopic structures  through the coupling of a time - modulated field to the system .    in section  [ sec :",
    "model ] , we present our theoretical method for the calculation of @xmath0 and @xmath9 .",
    "the numerical results are presented and discussed in sec .",

    "the system under investigation is sketched ( top view ) in , where the shaded area denotes the region acted upon by a time - modulated potential .",
    "the dot we consider has physical parameters typical to that in high mobility two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , formed in an algaas - gaas heterostructure .",
    "as such , mobility @xmath10 , mean free path @xmath11 at sufficient low temperatures , and dots with submicron dot sizes would be in the ballistic regime .",

    "the stationary dwell time within one - dimensional system was well defined .",
    "@xcite however , in a multi - channel system such as open quantum dots , we should consider not only the probability of finding the particle in the dot but also that due to evanescent states in the vicinity of the dot .",

    "( [ dt ] ) , we obtain the average dwell time of electrons in the open quantum dot system .",
    "in this section , we present our numerical examples for exploring the time - modulated effects on the quantum transport in open quantum dots  the conductance and the dwell time versus the incident electron energy @xmath73 . in the following ,",
    "we choose energy unit @xmath74 , length unit @xmath75 nm , unit of angular frequency @xmath76 trad / sec , and the effective mass @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the free electron mass of an electron .",
    "the geometric parameters are chosen such that the width @xmath79 @xmath80 for the leads , and the width @xmath81 @xmath82 and the length @xmath83 @xmath84 for the open quantum dot , which is typical for current experimental fabrication .",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the first transverse subband level in the leads , then the integral values of @xmath87 stand for the number of occupied subbands in the leads .    in the absence of time - modulation , the quantum states of the open quantum dot associate closely with the bound states of the corresponding closed dot with the same geometry . for a closed dot with length @xmath88 and width @xmath89",
    ", the bound state energy @xmath90 is labelled by a pair of quantum number @xmath91 .",
    "then we may obtain the rescaled bound state levels @xmath92 inside the closed dot .",
    "for an open dot , the energy spectrum consists of both true bound states and qbss corresponding either to electrons with energy @xmath73 less than or higher than the threshold energy @xmath93 in the lead . as such",
    ", there are only two possible true bound states in the open dot : @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "in , the conductance characteristic is studied as a function of incident electron energy : ( a ) in the absence of time - modulation , as a comparative reference ; and ( b)-(d ) in the presence of time - modulation with angular frequencies @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 , respectively , which also correspond to frequencies @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 ghz .",
    "this frequency range is typical for current experiments .",
    "@xcite in addition , the modulation amplitude is chosen to be @xmath102 @xmath103 .",
    "there are three dip structures common to all four plots .",
    "these dip structures occur at energies @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",
    "these are associated with the alignment of the incident electron energy with that of the qbs levels inside the open dot , as is indicated by the open triangle symbols locating the closed dot @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .",
    "the corresponding dwell time of these qbss are , respectively , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 ps , as shown in ( a ) .",
    "these dwell time peak structures confirm the resonant nature of the states inside the dot .",
    "another interesting feature in ( b ) is the side - dip structures around the qbss @xmath113 , which is associated with electrons at incident energy @xmath73 that are able to make @xmath114-photon intersideband transitions into the @xmath115-th qbs level .",
    "the condition is @xmath116 where the positive @xmath114 and negative @xmath114 indicate , respectively , the absorption and emission of @xmath114-photons .",
    "hence @xmath117 side - dips are at @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 ; @xmath121 side - dips are at @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 ; and @xmath125 side - dips are at @xmath126 , @xmath127 . the @xmath128 process in the vicinity of the @xmath129 state is barely identified and is at @xmath130",
    ".    two additional types of intersideband transition mechanisms are found in the low energy regime in . as is shown in ( d ) , whereas the frequency @xmath131 is high enough , the electrons with @xmath132 may emit @xmath1 and make transitions into @xmath133  the true bound state in the dot .",
    "the electron dwell time of this structure is @xmath134 ps , see ( d ) . in addition , electrons may also emit photons to make transitions into a qbs formed at energy just beneath a subband threshold in the lead .",
    "this mechanism is identified to be the fano structures at @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 , as shown in ( b)-(d ) , respectively , where @xmath138 is close to @xmath139 from below .",
    "correspondingly , the dwell time of these structures are @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 ps , see ( b)-(d ) .",
    "more precisely , these structures correspond to electrons that emit @xmath1 to @xmath143 and being trapped temporarily to form qbss in the lead .    to provide further evidence for the above two transition mechanisms , we plot , in , the spatial dependence of the time - averaged probability density .",
    "the parameters are chosen to be the same as in ( d ) . when the electron incident at energy @xmath144 , as shown in ( a ) , we see that the time - averaged electron probability concentrates entirely within the dot and is like a ( 2,1 ) state .",
    "this support the fact that the electron being trapped in a true bound state in the dot .",
    "second , when the electron incident at energy @xmath145 , the electron probability has long exponential tails extending into the leads .",
    "the edges of the dot are at @xmath146 .",
    "this demonstrates that the electron has made an intersideband transition , by emitting one photon , into a qbs in the lead which energy is just below the threshold energy .",
    "we have also checked that similar process can be found even in a time - modulated one dimensional quantum well connecting to leads .",
    "a traversing electron can make intersideband transitions into qbss in the leads or into true bound states in the well .",
    "@xcite    to better appreciate the meaning of the dwell time , we define the number of round - trip scatterings @xmath147 undertaken by the traversing electron .",
    "it is the ratio of the dwell time @xmath148 to the ballistic time @xmath149 it takes the electron to go between the two dot - openings .",
    "the ballistic time for electrons traversing through the quantum dot is simply @xmath150 where @xmath151 denotes the electron velocity , given by @xmath152 .",
    "we consider the electron incident in the lowest subband and then the electron ballistic time is given by @xmath153 in units of @xmath154 .",
    "hence , in ( d ) , the main peaks at @xmath155 , @xmath137 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 correspond to the ballistic times @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 ps , respectively .",
    "the corresponding @xmath164 s are , respectively , @xmath165 , @xmath142 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 .",
    "therefore , we obtain the number of round - trip scatterings @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 , respectively . in light of the above analysis , we can see that two round - trip times are already sufficient to form a significant qbs level inside the open dot .",
    "the estimation for @xmath149 could be improved by considering the effective electron velocity in the dot , rather than in the lead .",
    "but we expect @xmath147 to remain of the same order of magnitude as what we have shown here .",
    "moreover , the @xmath147 obtained here is the lower bound to any such improved estimation .",
    "it is known  @xcite that the strength of the time - modulated potential depends on the ratio of @xmath174 to @xmath56 . as a result , for a given amplitude @xmath174 ,",
    "the sideband dip features are suppressed with the increasing of the modulation frequency @xmath56 .",
    "this is illustrated in ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "on the other hand , if we fix the @xmath175 in , and choose the modulation amplitude to be @xmath176 , @xmath177 , and @xmath178 for ( a)-(c ) , respectively , we can see the side - dips due to @xmath179 intersideband processes in all the figures .",
    "this assures us that the @xmath180 is an important index for photon absorption and emission processes .",
    "furthermore , the qbs levels that associate with fewer number of round - trip scatterings may be merged with its nearby sidebands , forming a broadened dip structure : such as the wide - dip structure at @xmath181 in ( a ) . in the low energy regime , again , electrons are able to undertake one - photon ( or two - photon ) emission processes into a subband threshold in the lead .",
    "this one- ( or two- ) photon mechanism is demonstrated by small dip structures in @xmath0 at @xmath182 ( or @xmath183 ) in ( b ) and @xmath184 ( or @xmath185 ) in ( c ) .    to conclude this section , we note in passing that despite of wide dot openings , electrons traversing through the dot",
    "are still effectively mediated by just a few bound states of the corresponding closed dot structure .",
    "our results show that the conductance spectra for a time - modulated open dot show more intersideband structures other than those associated with the bound states of the corresponding close dot .",
    "we believe that these mechanisms should find their way of manifestation in the time - modulated phenomena of other nanostructures .",
    "in this work we have extended the time - dependent mode matching approach to the study of quantum transport in open quantum dot systems .",
    "we have calculated the conductance , the dwell time , and the spatial distribution of the electron probability and their dependence on the modulation amplitudes and frequencies .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown three types of coherent inelastic scatterings in a time - modulated open quantum dot .",
    "we have demonstrated the potential of establishing quantum transport as a spectroscopic probe for the qbss and true bound states in an open dot through the coupling of a time - modulated field to the system .",
