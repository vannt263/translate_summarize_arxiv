    "a novel interpretation of quantum mechanics ( qm )  which amounts to redesigning the foundations of quantum theory in accordance with `` classical '' concepts , foremost with determinism  has recently been laid out by g.thooft @xcite .",
    "the hope for a comprehensive theory expressed there is founded on the observation that quantum mechanical features arise in a large variety of deterministic `` mechanical '' models .",
    "while practically all of these models have been singular cases , i.e. , which can not easily be generalized to cover a realistic range of phenomena incorporating interactions , cellular automata ( ca ) promise to provide the necessary versatility , as we shall discuss @xcite . for an incomplete list of various earlier attempts in this field ,",
    "see , for example , refs.@xcite and further references therein .",
    "the linearity of quantum mechanics is a fundamental feature most notably embodied in the schrdinger equation .",
    "this linearity does not depend on the particular object under study , provided it is sufficiently isolated from anything else .",
    "this is reflected in the superposition principle and entails the `` quantum essentials '' of interference and entanglement .",
    "nevertheless , the linearity of qm has been questioned repeatedly and nonlinear modifications have been proposed , _",
    "e.g. _ in ref.@xcite  not only as suitable approximations for complicated many - body dynamics , but especially in order to test experimentally the robustness of qm against such _ nonlinear deformations _ , as well as in attempts to address the measurement problem in dynamical schemes ( none of which has been generally accepted ) . this has been thoroughly discussed by t.f.jordan who presented a proof ` from within ' quantum theory that the theory has to be linear , given the essential _ separability _",
    "assumption `` ... that the system we are considering can be described as part of a larger system without interaction with the rest of the larger system.''@xcite .",
    "recently , we have considered a seemingly unrelated _ discrete _ dynamical theory which deviates drastically from quantum theory , at first sight .",
    "however , we have shown with the help of sampling theory that the deterministic mechanics of the class of hamiltonian ca can be related to qm in the presence of a fundamental time scale .",
    "this relation demonstrates that consistency of the action principle of the underlying discrete dynamics implies , in particular , the linearity of both theories .",
    "our ca approach may offer additional insight into interference and entanglement , in the limit when the discreteness scale can be considered as small .    in section2 .",
    ", we summarize results obtained so far . while in section3 . , we present some considerations about the exact solutions of the ca equations of motion .",
    "in particular , we will comment about the relation to ontological ca and their states , the existence of which was introduced as the working hypothesis in ref.@xcite .",
    "reasoning about the linearity of qm has led us to the consideration of ca models , which are based on three essential ingredients @xcite : * i * ) deterministic discrete mechanics as proposed by t.d.lee in his program aimed to arrive at a manageable discretization for quantum gravity @xcite ( and references therein ) ; it presumes the existence of a _ minimal time _",

    "* iii * ) the `` oscillator representation '' of qm based on decomposing wave functions into real and imaginary parts , @xmath1 @xcite ; this is suggestive of a relation between apparently classical ca and quantum mechanical models .",
    "to summarize , the following results hold for a particular class of ca ( to be specified ) :    * evolution of these ca can be described by a _ continuous time _ schrdinger equation modified by @xmath0-dependent _ higher - order derivatives _ with respect to time .",
    "* there is a @xmath0-dependent _ dispersion relation _ for stationary states .",
    "* there are @xmath0-dependent _ conservation laws _ in one - to - one correspondence with those of the corresponding qm models in the continuum .",
    "* there are _ multipartite ca _ obeying the superposition principle , _",
    "i.e. _ which show the tensorial structures of qm .",

    "last not least , we find :    * the known qm results are obtained correctly in the _ continuum limit _ , @xmath9 .",
    "we describe natural hamiltonian ca with countably many degrees of freedom presently in terms of _ complex integer - valued _ state variables @xmath10 , _",
    "i.e. _ by _ gaussian integers _ ( @xmath11 ) , where @xmath12 denote different degrees of freedom and @xmath13 different states labelled by this discrete _ clock variable_. various equivalent forms of the action for such ca exist , as indicated earlier @xcite .  in particular",
    ", making use of the mentioned decomposition into real and imaginary parts , @xmath1 , our theory describes a perfectly classical looking discrete mechanical system , cf .",
    "however , we will employ here the more compact description in terms of complex variables , which is useful for the construction of composite ca in analogy with multipartite qm systems .",
    "let @xmath14 denote a self - adjoint matrix of gaussian integers that will play the role of hamilton operator .",
    "furthermore , let us introduce @xmath15 , for any quantity @xmath16 depending on the clock variable @xmath17 . with a summation convention for greek indices , @xmath18 ,",
    "we often simplify notation further by writing @xmath19 .",

    " remarkably , variations of terms that are _ constant , linear , or quadratic _ in integer - valued variables yield analogous results as standard infinitesimal variations of corresponding expressions in the continuum .    with the help of these ingredients ,",
    "the variational principle is postulated : 0.2 cm [ _ ca action principle _ ] 0.15 cm the discrete evolution of a ca is determined by stationarity of the action under arbitrary integer - valued variations of all dynamical variables , @xmath29.@xmath30 0.2 cm    we emphasize the following characteristics of this ca action principle :    * while infinitesimal variations do not conform with integer valuedness , there is _ a priori _ no restriction of integer variations . hence _",
    "arbitrary _ integer - valued variations are admitted .",
    "* one could imagine higher order terms in the action ( [ action ] ) , _ i.e. _ of higher than second order in @xmath31 or @xmath32 .",
    "however , given arbitrary variations @xmath33 and @xmath34 , such additional contributions can not be admitted .",
    "otherwise the number of equations of motion generated by variation of the action , according to eq.([variation ] ) , would exceed the number of variables .",
    "( a suitable small number of such terms , which are nonzero only for some fixed values of @xmath17 , could encode _ initial conditions _ for the evolution . )",

    "while leading to consistent discrete equations of motion , however , these nonlinear equations generally are beset with undesirable nonlocal features in the corresponding continuum description @xcite .",

    "_ eq.([variation ] ) , gives discrete analogues of the schrdinger equation and its adjoint , respectively : @xmath37 \\label{delpsi }   \\dot\\psi_n^*&=&-\\frac{1}{i}(\\hat h\\psi_n)^ *   \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] recalling that @xmath38 and @xmath39 , _ etc .",

    " notwithstanding their appearance , all finite difference equations here are of second order , necessitating _ two initial values _ , unlike in the continuum @xcite .",
    "we will address this point in section3 .",
    "in any case , the form of equations ( [ xdotca ] ) suggested the name _",
    "hamiltonian ca _ , which is also justified by the fact that analogues of poisson brackets and classical like observables can be introduced here @xcite .",
    "the time - reversal invariant equations of motion of section2.2 .",
    "give rise to conservation laws which are in _ one - to - one correspondence _ with those of the schrdinger equation in the continuum .",
    "in fact , the following theorem can be easily verified :    0.2 cm [ _ theorema _ ] 0.15 cm for any matrix @xmath46 that commutes with @xmath44 , @xmath47=0 $ ] , there is a _ discrete conservation law _ : @xmath48 for self - adjoint @xmath46 , defined by gaussian integers , this relation is about real integer quantities.@xmath30 0.2 cm    a rearrangement of eq.([gconserv ] ) yields the corresponding conserved quantity @xmath49 : @xmath50 _ i.e. _ a complex ( real for @xmath51 ) integer - valued two-`time ' _ correlation function _ which is invariant under a shift @xmath52 , @xmath53 .  in particular",
    ", for @xmath54 , the conservation law amounts to a constraint on the state variables : @xmath55 this plays a similar role for discrete ca as the familiar _ normalization _ of state vectors in continuum qm ; _ cf .",
    "_ eqs.([qcont1])([qcont2 ] ) below .",
    " we also define the symmetrized conserved quantity : @xmath56 for later use .",
    "there exists an one - to - one invertible _",
    "map _ between the dynamics of discrete hamiltonian ca and continuum qm in presence of a fundamental time scale @xmath0 @xcite . due to the finite discreteness scale",
    ", the continuous time wave functions are _ bandlimited _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , their fourier transforms have only finite support in frequency space , @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "hence , sampling theory allows one to reconstruct continuous time signals , wave functions @xmath58 , from their discrete samples , the ca state variables @xmath10 , and",
    "_ vice versa _",
    " further aspects relating discrete and continuous dynamics , in particular concerning models that do not belong to the class of hamiltonian ca , have also been discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the resulting mapping rules obtained through the reconstruction formula of shannon s sampling theorem @xcite can be summarized as follows : @xmath59 \\label{npm1 } \\psi_{n\\pm 1}^\\alpha & \\longmapsto & \\;\\exp\\big [ \\pm l\\frac{\\mbox{d}}{\\mbox{d}t}\\big ] \\psi^\\alpha ( t ) = \\psi^\\alpha ( t\\pm l )   \\;\\ ; , \\\\ [ 1ex ] \\label{samp }   \\psi^\\alpha ( nl)&\\longmapsto & \\;\\psi_n^\\alpha   \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] keeping in mind that the continuum wave function is bandlimited .",
    " we remark that kernels that differ from the original @xmath60 function can be used to modify the reconstruction formula , turning the sharp bandlimit into other types of cut - off . however , as long as the reconstruction formular remains a linear map , the form of the equations of motion and of the conservation laws does not change .    with the help of these results ,",
    "all ca equations are mapped to their continuum versions .",
    "for example , corresponding to eqs.([gconserv])([q ] ) , there exist analogous conservation laws and conserved quantities , which are obtained by applying the mapping rules separately to all wave function factors that appear .",
    "thus , for example , the eq.([q ] ) yields the conserved quantity : @xmath61\\psi ( t ) \\\\ [ 1ex ] \\label{qcont2 }   & \\;&= \\psi^{*\\alpha}(t)\\psi^\\alpha ( t ) + \\frac{l^2}{2}\\mbox{re}\\;\\psi^{*\\alpha}(t)\\frac{\\mbox{d}^2}{\\mbox{d}t^2}\\psi^\\alpha ( t )   + \\mbox{o}(l^4 )     \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath0-dependent corrections to the continuum limit ( @xmath9 ) , namely the usually conserved normalization @xmath62 .    similarly , the schrdinger equation with finite-@xmath0 correction terms is obtained from eq.([delpsistar ] ) @xcite : @xmath63 this leads , in particular , to the @xmath0-dependent dispersion relation for stationary states : @xmath64 \\;\\;,\\ ] ] giving their energies @xmath65 in terms of the eigenvalues of the diagonalized _ dimensionless _ hamiltonian , @xmath66 .",
    "we observe an effect of the band limit , @xmath67 , as expected .",
    "interestingly , by inverting eq.([dispersion ] ) , we find that the eigenvalues @xmath68 must be constrained by @xmath69 , for all @xmath70 . a complete classification of such hamiltonians represented by _",
    "symmetric matrices _ has been provided recently @xcite  indeed there are classes of them with infinite numbers of members besides irregular ones . for self - adjoint matrices instead , analogous results are only partially known .",
    "so far , we have been concerned with isolated single hamiltonian ca",
    ". of course , we may ask : can discrete ca form composite multipartite systems ?  only if the answer is ` yes ' , the quantum features of ca can possibly cover the superposition principle to its fullest extent .",
    "therefore , we wonder whether not only the _ linearity _ of the evolution law but also the _ tensor product structure _ of composite wave functions finds its analogue here .",
    "these are the fundamental ingredients of the usual continuum theory reflected in interference and entanglement of states or observables . which should be recovered in the continuum limit ( @xmath9 ) of the ca picture , at least .",
    "furthermore , when the discreteness scale @xmath0 is finite , the dynamics of composites of ca which do not interact with each other should lead to _ no spurious correlations _ among them  the principle of `` no correlations without interactions '' , which holds in all of known physics .",
    "naturally , this principle does not rule out the possibility of entangled states , presenting _ the _ prototype of quantum correlations , which may have been formed during interactions among parts of a multipartite system or have been present already from initial conditions for its evolution .",
    "let us first discuss in more detail the obstructions encountered when trying to formulate composites of hamiltonian ca along the lines familiar from qm . while the way to overcome them is described in the next subsection2.5.1 .    the want - to - be discrete time derivative , @xmath15 , for any quantity @xmath16 depending on the clock variable @xmath17 , which appears all - over in ca equations of motion and conservation laws , does not obey the _",
    "leibniz rule _ : @xmath71}= \\dot a_n\\textstyle{\\frac{b_{n+1}+b_{n-1}}{2}}+ \\textstyle{\\frac{a_{n+1}+a_{n-1}}{2}}\\dot b_n   \\neq \\dot a_nb_n + a_n\\dot b_n   \\;\\;.\\ ] ] similar observations can be expected for other definitions , in particular first - order ones , one might come up with .",
    "the failure of the leibniz rule for the above ` derivative ' implies that a multi - ca equation of motion analogous to the single - ca eq.([delpsistar ] ) : @xmath72 where @xmath73 describes a block - diagonal hamiltonian in the absence of interactions among ca , can not be decomposed in the usual way . because of eq.([leibniz ] ) , _ factorization _ of eq.([psieq ] ) is hindered on the left - hand side , since unphysical correlations will be produced among the components of a factorized wave function , such as @xmath74 or for superpositions of such factorized terms .",
    "furthermore , applying the mapping rules of section2.4 . , we find that bilinear terms , @xmath75 , for example , do not converge to the correct qm expression , when taking the limit @xmath9 . which should be @xmath76 , in order to allow the decoupling of two subsystems that do not interact . even on the right - hand side of eq.([psieq ] ) we encounter this kind of obstruction .",
    "the latter is a generic problem of nonlinear terms in the equations of motion of discrete ca : _ the linear map provided by shannon s theorem does not commute with the multiplication implied by the nonlinearities .",
    "_ this follows from the explicit reconstruction formula ( or any variant thereof that is linear ) @xcite .",
    "the difficulties just pointed out can be traced to the implicit assumption that components of a multipartite ca are _ synchronized _ to the extent that they share a common clock variable @xmath17 .",
    "a a radical way out of the impasse encountered is to resort to a _ many - time _",
    "formalism @xcite .",
    "this means giving up synchronization among parts of the composite ca by introducing a set of clock variables , @xmath77 , one for each one out of @xmath78 components",
    ".    it may be surprising to find this in the present nonrelativistic context , since the many - time formalism has been introduced by dirac , tomonaga , and schwinger in their respective formulations of relativistically covariant many - particle qm or quantum field theory , where a global synchronization can not be maintained @xcite .",
    "we replace here the single - ca action of eq.([action ] ) by an integer - valued multipartite - ca action : @xmath79 : = \\psi^*\\big ( \\sum_{k=1}^m\\hat{\\cal s}_{(k)}\\;+\\;\\hat{\\cal i}\\big ) \\psi \\;\\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath80 and , correspondingly , @xmath81 as independent _ gaussian integer _",
    "variables ; the self - adjoint operator @xmath82 incorporates interactions between different ca ; whereas @xmath83 is as introduced in eq.([action ] ) , with subscript @xmath84 indicating that it concerns _ exclusively _ the pair of indices pertaining to the @xmath85-th single - ca subsystem : @xmath86 \\;\\;,\\ ] ] with summation over _ all _ clock variables and over greek indices appearing twice ; the @xmath87-operation , however , acts only with respect to the explicitly indicated @xmath88 , @xmath89 , while the single - ca hamiltonian , @xmath90 , requires a matrix multiplication , as before .",
    "obviously , we can apply the _ ca action principle _ also to the present situation with the generalized action of eq.([maction ] ) .",
    "this results in the following discrete equations of motion : @xmath91 together with the adjoint equations ; here the interaction @xmath82 , like @xmath90 , is assumed to be independent of the clock variables and the @xmath87-operation acts only with respect to @xmath88 in the @xmath85-th term on the left - hand side .",
    "we have verified that this many - time formulation avoids the problems of a single - time multi - ca equation , _ cf .",
    "_ eq.([psieq ] ) @xcite .",
    " in particular , in the absence of interactions with each other , between ca subsystems , @xmath92 , _ no unphysical correlations _ are introduced among independent ca subsystems",
    ".    furthermore , _ continuous multi - time equations _ corresponding to eqs.([meom ] ) are obtained by applying the mapping rules given in section2.3 . to the discrete equations .",
    "we find no problem of incompatibility between multiplication according to nonlinear terms _ vs. _ linear mapping according to _",
    "shannon s theorem _ , since a separate mapping is applied for each one of the clock variables .",
    "this effectively replaces @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is a continuous real time variable . in this way , a _ modified multi - time schrdinger equation _",
    "is obtained : @xmath95 \\psi_{\\dots t_k\\dots}^{\\dots\\alpha_k\\dots } \\;=\\;\\frac{1}{i}\\big ( \\sum_{k=1}^mh_{(k)}^{\\alpha_k\\beta_k } \\psi_{\\dots t_k\\dots}^{\\dots\\beta_k\\dots }   \\;+\\;{\\cal i}^{\\dots\\alpha_k\\dots\\;\\beta_1\\dots\\beta_m } \\psi_{\\dots t_k\\dots}^{\\beta_1\\dots\\beta_m }   \\big ) \\;\\;,\\ ] ] where an overall factor of two from the left - hand side has been absorbed into the matrices on the right . by construction , here @xmath96 is bandlimited with respect to each variable @xmath94 .    performing the continuum limit , @xmath9",
    ", we arrive at the multi - time schrdinger equation ( one power of @xmath97 providing the physical dimension of @xmath90 and @xmath98 ) considered by dirac and tomonaga @xcite",
    ". however , when @xmath0 is fixed and finite , modifications in the form of powers of @xmath99 arise on its left - hand side , similarly as in single ca case before .    in the present nonrelativistic context , it may be appropriate to identify @xmath100 , in which case the operator on the left - hand side of eq.([mschroed ] ) , for @xmath9 , can be simply replaced by @xmath101 .",
    "this results in the usual ( single - time ) _ many - body schrdinger equation_.    finally , the study of the _ conservation laws _ of the multipartite ca equations of motion can be performed along the lines of section2.3 . and analogous results have been obtained @xcite",
    ".      the equivalent discrete or continuous many - time equations ( [ meom ] ) and ( [ mschroed ] ) are both linear in the ca wave function @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , superpositions of solutions of these equations also present solutions and the _ superposition principle _ does indeed hold for multipartite hamiltonian ca .    as in the case of single ca , this entails the fact that these discrete systems  with all variables , parameters , _ etc . _ presented by gaussian integers",
    " can produce _ interference _ effects as in quantum mechanics .",
    "even more interesting , their composites can also show _ entanglement _ , which is deemed an essential feature of qm .",
    "this follows from the form of the equations of motion , which allow for superpositions of factorized states .",
    "a warning is in order , concerning expressions borrowed from qm which we used freely here , such as `` wave functions '' and `` states '' .",
    "they usually invoke the notion of vectors in a _",
    "hilbert space _ , which turns into a complex projective space upon normalization of the vectors .",
    "however , as has become obvious in section2.3 .",
    ", see eqs.([normal])([q ] ) , and which can be seen similarly in the multipartite case , as long as the ca are truly discrete ( @xmath102 ) , the normalization ( squared ) of vectors is not among the conserved quantities , hence not applicable , but is replaced by a conserved two - time correlation function .",
    "furthermore , the space of states presently is _ not _ a hilbert space , since it fails in two respects : the vector - space and completeness properties are absent . instead , the space of states in the presented ca theory can be classified as a _ pre - hilbert module over the commutative ring of gaussian integers _",
    "@xcite .",
    "we conclude here that superpositions of states , interference effects , and entanglement , as in qm , all can be found already on the `` primitive '' level of the presently considered natural hamiltonian ca , discrete single or multipartite systems which are characterized by ( complex ) integer - valued variables and couplings .",
    "we recall that the schrdinger equation , @xmath103 , can be formally solved by exponentiating , @xmath104 . here",
    "we present the analogous formal solution of the ca equation of motion ( [ delpsistar ] ) , _ i.e. _ , of the second - order finite difference equation @xmath105 , which can be solved by elementary means .",

    "i.e. _ , in order to have solutions that neither grow nor decay exponentially in @xmath17 .",
    "we observe that the general solution of our second - order equation is determined by _ two _ initial values , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , unlike the case of the first - order schrdinger equation . in order to better understand this",
    ", we consider the continuum limit , letting @xmath112 , but keeping @xmath113 fixed and the _ dimensionful _ eigenvalues @xmath114 as well .",
    "thus , we have @xmath115 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath116 . in this limit , the solution ( [ discsol ] ) correctly exponentiates , if and only if @xmath117 .    therefore , we have to restrict the set of solutions by allowing only the subset of initial values which satisfy the condition @xmath117 , in order to assure quantum mechanical behaviour in the continuum limit .",
    "we speculate about the role of solutions with @xmath118 shortly .    rewriting eq.([discsol ] )",
    "symbolically as @xmath119 , the evolution fulfills the composition law @xmath120 , even for general initial conditions .",
    "this can be demonstrated by induction and corresponds to the semigroup property of unitary evolution in quantum mechanics .      in order to address this question",
    ", we have to define what is meant by ` ontological ' . here , we refer to the fundamental hypothesis of the _ ca interpretation of quantum mechanics _ proposed and elaborated by g.thooft @xcite .",
    "namely , there are so - called _ ontological states which evolve deterministically_. they constitute the physical reality of nature that we wish to explore .",
    "we presently consider a ca characterized by a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "its corresponding discrete states may serve to define the basis of a hilbert space .",
    "however , reflecting their ontological character , formal superpositions among these states  which we do not hesitate to work with in qm  are not admitted .",
    "superpositions of ontological states are _ not _ ontological , they are not `` out there '' in the universe . as a consequence ,",
    "a finite number of ontological states can only evolve by _ permutations _ among themselves !",
    "the question in the title of this section can now be asked more precisely : is the hamiltonian ca dynamics , as described , compatible with the permutation dynamics of ontological states ? we will find some partial answers by resorting to very simple indicative examples .",
    "let @xmath121 denote the state variables and @xmath44 a 2x2 self - adjoint hamiltonian matrix , all ( complex ) integer - valued , as before in section2 .",
    "it is convenient to collect the state variables into a two - dimensional vector and write the evolution equation ( [ delpsistar ] ) as : @xmath122    we have argued that the formal solution of such an equation , given in eq.([discsol ] ) , approaches an exponential as in qm for the continuum limit ( @xmath9 ) , if and only if the necessary two inital values coincide . assuming this , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath123 , we find that the evolution generally takes place in the two - dimensional space given ; however , it can not be avoided that in the sequence @xmath124 appear regularly states which are superpositions of any two linearly independent states , say @xmath125 and @xmath126 , which we may select as ontological basis states , no matter how we choose @xmath44 . in this case",
    ", evolution does _ not _ consist of permutations only .    in other words , in this two - dimensional example",
    ", we learn that the discrete evolution which conforms with qm in the continuum limit passes unavoidably through superposition states as intermediates . which are not ontological .",
    "we leave it as a _ conjecture _ that this happens independently of the dimensionality of the state space . which seems to disqualify such a hamiltonian ca as an example of a strictly ontological model .",
    "it is tempting to speculate now that an ontological model must deviate in one way or another from the hamiltonian ca under consideration and from a qm model in its continuum limit .",
    " one way could be to give up self - adjointness of the hamiltonian , which we do not follow here . ",
    "another is to abandon the condition of coinciding initial values , @xmath117 , thereby renouncing the requirement that such a model have an obvious qm continuum limit , _ cf .",
    "_ section2.4 .",
    "for example , we may choose one of the pauli matrices as hamiltonian : @xmath127 with @xmath128 .",
    "then , considering the initial values @xmath129 and @xmath130 , we simply evaluate the first few steps of the evolution according to eq.([update ] ) to obtain : @xmath131 it is obvious how the sequence continues and arrives at the initial values within the next 6 steps , thus becoming _",
    "periodic_. we could have used the general solution ( [ discsol ] ) instead , with @xmath132 , in the present example .  the rescaling in the intermediate states @xmath133 and @xmath134 would violate the conserved normalization of a state vector in qm .",
    "however , it is perfectly in accordance with the corresponding discrete conservation laws discussed in section2.3 . and applicable here .",
    " in this way , we have found an example of an elementary permutation dynamics realized by a hamiltonian ca .",
    "it will be interesting to see whether or how the findings here generalize to more complex higher dimensional ontological models .",
    "this presents a brief review of earlier work which has demonstrated surprising quantum features arising in integer - valued , hence `` natural '' , _ hamiltonian cellular automata _ @xcite .",

    "entanglement_.    surprisingly , we have been forced  in our approach employing sampling theory to construct the map between ca and an equivalent continuum picture  to introduce a many - time formulation , which only appeared in relativistic quantum mechanics before , as introduced by dirac , tomonaga , and schwinger @xcite .",
    "this points towards a crucial further step in these developments , which is still missing , namely a relativistic ca model of _ interacting quantum fields_. without the possibility of interacting multipartite ca with quantumlike features , as described here , it is hard to envisage a ca picture of dynamical fields spread out in spacetime .",
    "last not least , we have presented a primitive attempt to see the relation , if any , between the hamiltonian ca here and ontological models as advocated in ref.@xcite . which resulted in the suggestion that it might depend on initial conditions , whether such a ca behaves either as a qm model ( with corrections due to discreteness ) or is of the ontological kind .",
