    "the statistics of distributions of lyapunov exponents ( sometimes called stretch  exponents ) have been studied in a number of physical situations ranging from turbulent flows @xcite to hamiltonian dynamics ( in many ",
    "particle systems @xcite and conservative mappings @xcite ) , and are related to generalized dimensions and entropies @xcite .",
    "lyapunov exponents provide a quantitative characterization of dynamics : for a dynamical system in @xmath1dimensions , the @xmath1 lyapunov exponents of an orbit measure the rate at which volume elements in the phase space expand or contract along the orbit , in the different directions .",
    "a positive lyapunov exponent ( le ) signifies exponential divergence of trajectories in the given direction , and is associated with chaotic dynamics , while negative les are associated with stable motion , when nearby trajectories converge .",
    "although the exponents are global or asymptotic quantities , it is often instructive to examine the distribution of values that the le may take locally , namely over finite - time segments along a given trajectory @xcite .",
    "if the underlying attractor is nonuniform , on a chaotic trajectory the _ local _ le can be negative within a finite time interval .",
    "similarly , on a nonchaotic trajectory the local le can take positive values over finite time intervals @xcite .",
    "these considerations are of additional relevance for lyapunov exponents computed from experimental data @xcite , since these are , naturally , only finite  time exponents .    in this paper , we study the statistics of finite  time or local les in low  dimensional dissipative dynamical systems . local lyapunov exponents , which are defined in eq .",
    "( [ lle ] ) below , depend on initial conditions , unlike the asymptotic or global lyapunov exponent .",
    "the distribution of values that the local exponents take depends , in a characteristic manner , on the nature of the dynamical state ; our present focus is on characterizing the different distributions that obtain for different dynamical attractors .",
    "we find that the characteristic densities of lyapunov exponents fall in distinct classes depending on the nature of the attractor .",
    "although the lle distributions are stationary , they depend on the time interval over which the finite  time le is computed . for very short times , the distributions keep changing shape and are difficult to classify , while in the asymptotic limit , as the time interval @xmath2 , all distributions must eventually collapse to a @xmath3function centered on the global le .",
    "the manner in which this happens is usually described by the multifractal formalism @xcite , but here we address the important corrections to scaling that can obtain for finite  times .    some aspects of such distributions have been studied previously . for `` typical '' chaotic dynamics , when correlations die out exponentially rapidly , the central ",
    "limit theorem holds for a number of averaged quantities , including local lyapunov exponents @xcite .",
    "thus , the density is a gaussian function , whose width depends on the length of the time interval over which the exponents are computed . for intermittent systems on the other hand , it is well known that correlations die out very slowly ; this can lead to a power ",
    "law scaling for several quantities such as the lyapunov exponent or the diffusion constant @xcite .",
    "benzi also studied intermittency in more detail and observed a deviation from the normal distribution in quantities such as the fluctuations of the response function @xcite .",
    "we extend the analysis of finite  time lyapunov exponents to the particular case of fully developed chaos and intermittency , where dynamical correlations persist over long times .",
    "this leads to significant departures from the simple central limit behaviour , and the resulting distributions are quite distinct from the normal density , typically having exponential or stretched exponential tails .",
    "an example which can be solved exactly is the commonly studied logistic map at the ulam point , namely @xmath4 , for which we obtain an analytic form of the probability density for all times .",
    "the same distribution occurs for all parameter values where there is a boundary crisis , and thus appears to be quite general .",
    "we also treat the case of intermittent dynamics in some detail . in all instances of intermittency , the dynamics switches between two or more distinct types of behaviour .",
    "the distribution of lles that arise in such a situation can be shown to have components arising separately from these individual behaviours .",
    "our main results are presented in section ii , where we discuss the different types of distributions for finite  time les .",
    "our studies have been mainly on simple dynamical systems such as the logistic mapping , but the results we obtain appear to be more generally valid : these distributions can be seen a variety of systems ( both mappings and flows ) .",
    "this is followed by a summary and conclusions in section iii .",
    "for generality , consider a @xmath1dimensional discrete nonlinear system @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a set of parameters .",
    "there are @xmath1 lyapunov exponents which are defined by considering a set of orthonormal @xmath1-dimensional vectors @xmath8 , and examining their evolution under the effect of the tangent mapping which is determined by the jacobian of @xmath9 , namely @xmath10 . defining @xmath11the lyapunov exponents are ^m = _ n _ j=1^n _ j^m ,   m = 1,2,  d .",

    "however for sufficient large @xmath15 ( but still far from the limit @xmath27 ) the characteristic distributions depend on the details of the dynamics , so that the approach to the limit is distinctive . in the following subsections we discuss the particular cases of fully  developed chaos and intermittency in detail .",

    "raphson procedure ) . shown in fig .",
    "3 is the solution for the case of @xmath44 , when the polynomial @xmath39 is of order 7 .",
    "the divergences in the distribution @xmath45 occur as pairs of real roots merge . for the specific case of the logistic mapping , as @xmath15 increases",
    "the largest number of singularities accumulate near @xmath46 .",
    "the asymptotic form , eq .",
    "( [ cusp ] ) also gets progressively more accurate with increasing @xmath15 [ see fig .",
    "2(b ) ] .",
    "this form of the density is not restricted to the logistic mapping at @xmath28 , but is also seen in a number of mappings which have fully developed chaos . even in the logistic mapping , it occurs at _ all _ parameter values corresponding to widening crises @xcite , when the attractor is a rescaled image of the attractor at @xmath28 .",
    "we have also examined the dependence of the variance of the distribution on @xmath15 .",
    "typically , @xmath47 for these distributions since they narrow with increasing @xmath15 , going , in the limit of @xmath27 , to a @xmath3-function . for the case of a gaussian density , @xmath48 = 1 , while for the exponential density the variance decreases more rapidly , and @xmath48= 2 .",
    "our results for the variance are shown in fig .",
    "intermittent dynamics is characterized by a long  range temporal persistence of correlations @xcite , evidenced for example , by the existence of power  law dependence of a number of quantities on the parameters . the question of the distribution of for intermittent chaos has been explored previously by benzi @xcite , who showed that there are significant departures from the gaussian distribution .    for the case of intermittency , the characteristic density of appears to be a combination of a normal density and a stretched exponential tail , an example of which is shown in fig .",
    "for @xmath49 , the density is a gaussian , while above @xmath50 , the dependence is p ( , n )   > _ * .",
    "[ interb ] since the exponent @xmath51 , the exponential tail decays extremely slowly with @xmath15 . at @xmath52 ,",
    "there is a crossover between the gaussian and the stretched exponential density , which results in a completely asymmetric density about the mean .",
    "similar distributions arise for all intermittent dynamical states , including the case of nonchaotic dynamics @xcite .",
    "one way of understanding the above ( phenomenological ) expression for the density is to note that in all intermittent dynamics , the motion switches between two types of states . for each of these different dynamical states ,",
    "the local lyapunov exponents have a gaussian distribution centered at different values of @xmath40 , and with different amplitudes , and the stretched exponential behaviour interpolates between them .",
    "the example for which data is presented here in fig .",
    "1(c ) and in fig .",
    "5 is the type - i intermittency near the tangent bifurcation in the logistic mapping .",
    "this dynamics can be naturally separated into laminar regions ( that stay close to the incipient period3 orbit ) and chaotic bursts .",
    "time lyapunov exponents can be separately computed for trajectories that stay entirely in the laminar phase and entirely in the chaotic phase : these give the normal densities shown by dotted lines in fig .",
    "trajectory segments that visit both the components of the intermittent motion contribute to the stretched exponential tail ; with increasing @xmath15 , the purely chaotic component is more difficult to identify , since there are fewer segments that are of duration longer than @xmath15 .",
    "the stretched exponential tail thus decreases with increasing @xmath15 , and the distribution eventually collapses to a delta  function .",
    "this behavior is generic at all intermittencies . for the mapping x_n+1",
    "= x_n + c x_n^2 , [ wang ] which has been extensively studied within the thermodynamic formalism in the context of type - i intermittency @xcite , we observe a similar decomposition of the overall density of lles to a superposition of two independent gaussians with stretched exponential interpolation between the two .",
    "furthermore , we have also examined a number of higher dimensional maps and flows , and find that at all intermittent dynamics , including the cases of forced systems or of nonchaotic dynamics @xcite , non  gaussian stretched exponential tails are seen .",
    "an example shown in fig .",
    "6 is the density @xmath53 for the largest nonzero lyapunov exponent in the lorenz system ( see the figure caption for a definition of the dynamical system ) with the parameters chosen to correspond to intermittent dynamics .",
    "the case of crisis  induced intermittency @xcite ( just beyond widening crises , for instance ) is similar , with the two independent densities being , respectively , the exponential cusp , namely eq .",
    "( [ cusp ] ) for the component for the pre ",
    "crisis chaotic attractor , and a gaussian density which corresponds to the widened chaotic attractor .",
    "the density shown in fig .",
    "1(d ) for the period  five widening crisis in the logistic mapping can be analysed in a manner very similar to the case illustrated in fig .",
    "the variance for these distributions decrease somewhat faster that for the gaussian , namely @xmath47 with @xmath54 . with increasing @xmath15 , the exponent however changes , eventually reaching the gaussian limit , @xmath55 ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "a major motivation for the present work has been the realization that local lyapunov exponent distributions have characteristic forms depending on the nature of the attractors , and that these provide an additional and important dynamical characterization of the chaotic state of a system .",
    "we have mainly focused on the cases of fully developed chaos , crises and intermittencies  namely those attractors for which the density shows a marked departure from the simple gaussian form .",
    "this is indicative of significant finite  size corrections to the multifractal formalism @xcite .",
    "all these cases show exponential tails albeit for different reasons @xcite . for fully developed chaos in the logistic mapping",
    "we obtain the ( in principle ) exact expression for the probability density as well as an asymptotic approximate form .",
    "these densities are seen at all parameter values corresponding to interior crises , and thus are quite common .",
    "the case of intermittency was analysed in detail , and the density seen there was shown to arise from individual densities corresponding to the different components of the motion ( laminar and chaotic , say ) with the stretched exponential tail corresponding to interpolation between these two .",
    "we have verified the generality of our results for a number of other dynamical systems , for example higher dimensional mappings such as the hnon system or flows such as the duffing oscillator , the forced damped pendulum , the lorenz equations these densities are quickly attained , and are maintained even as @xmath15 increases , and for fairly high levels of additive noise @xcite .",
    "this is of particular relevance when analyzing experimental data .",
    "the logistic map was used here for illustration since exact results can be obtained for at least one parameter value , but the probability density for finite  time lyapunov exponents in any system can be obtained via eq .",
    "( [ result ] ) so long as the invariant measure is known . in this regard ,",
    "it is interesting to note that recently , pingel @xcite have described a general inversion technique whereby a class of 1d maps having a prescribed invariant density can be constructed .",
    "the characteristic forms for the density that we have described are found in a variety of systems , including those where the dynamics is not chaotic . when a system is forced quasiperiodically ,",
    "chaotic attractors can be transformed to strange nonchaotic attractors @xcite .",
    "these attractors are fractal , but the largest lyapunov exponent is zero or negative . because of the spatial fractality , though , for short times the local lyapunov exponents can be positive , and the distributions again fall into the classes that we have seen here for chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of high  stretch tails also appears to be very general . in recent work calvo and labastie",
    "@xcite have examined the distribution of in a conservative system , namely in a 19particle cluster simulation study .",
    "they observe that when the dynamics is intermittent @xcite , the density has a stretched exponential tail .",
    "_ local _ analysis can be more revealing of the nature of the dynamics than global quantities , and this is an issue when predictability is of concern . for instance",
    ", in applications that aim to predict future behaviour based on time series data ( for example in atmospheric sciences or in economics ) , atypical or extreme behaviour which contributes to the stretched tails is a serious bottleneck . since the largest lyapunov exponent can be extracted from time ",
    "series data though standard techniques , examination of the finite time distributions can give more insight into the dynamics than the extraction of a single exponent .",
    "we conclude with a few general comments . except for fully developed chaos when",
    "the distributions can be derived for all times , the present study does not examine the case of very short times when the distributions are atypical and it is not clear if they are stationary .",
    "the characteristic behaviour becomes apparent for times that are not too short , and persists thereafter .",
    "thus , local lyapunov exponent densities provide _ quantitative _ distinctions among different chaotic attractors .",
    "exponential tails are characteristic of fully developed chaos and intermittency : whether these are related to analogous distributions that arise in turbulent flows @xcite or stretched  exponential tails in relaxation phenomena is an interesting open question .",
