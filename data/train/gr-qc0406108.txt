    "over a long period of time cosmologists believed that quantum cosmology would find a way to treat initial as well as final singularity . loop quantum gravity ( lqg )",
    "is at present the main background independent and nonperturbative candidate for quantum theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) is the application of lqg to an homogeneous minisuperspace environment .",
    "calculations performed within lqg established the possibility to avoid singularity @xcite .",
    "semi - classical equations within lqc were studied recently and some intriguing conclusions were obtained .",
    "first of all , the big crunch does not appear in models with realistic effective potentials @xcite .",
    "moreover , if initial conditions are chosen at the bounce so that the scalar field rests at the minimum of the effective potential , during the subsequent evolution it climbs the potential and hence generates initial conditions for successful slow - roll inflation @xcite .",
    "these results were obtained by numerical integration of lqc equations and although authors claim that their results are quite generic , application of alternative methods to the problem is of interest .",
    "qualitative analysis is quite a powerful method and it was successfully applied within the framework of general relativity ( gr ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) and gauge theories of gravity @xcite . in this paper qualitative analysis of semi - classical lqc equations , which are presented in the next section , is performed .",
    "the origin of bounce is discussed in section 3 .",
    "simple model of massless scalar field with absolutely flat potential is studied in section 4 .",
    "qualitative behavior of cosmological model with massive scalar field is considered in section 5 .",
    "conclusions follow in the last section .",
    "near the classical singularity the picture of continuous spacetime breaks down and evolution within lqc is described by difference equations .",
    "however there is a region where semi - classical differential equations are valid but quantum effects are already significant . in this region of small distances the geometrical density @xmath0 acquires quantum corrections . good approximation to eigenvalues of geometrical density operator in lqc for large quantization parameter @xmath1 is given by @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the scale where quantum corrections become essential .",
    "it can be larger than the planckian scale @xmath5 , since the quantization parameter @xmath1 , which must take half integer values , is arbitrary @xcite .",

    "notice immediately , that the scalar field influence on dynamics of the system is due to the unique ( last ) gradient term in ( [ psidot ] ) .",
    "when the effective potential is completely flat , @xmath23const , this term vanishes .",
    "moreover , additional simplification is possible here , since the scalar field derivative @xmath24 can be expressed from ( [ eq1 ] ) and substituted into ( [ eq3 ] ) thus reducing the dimension of the dynamical system to two .",
    "the system can be completely characterized in terms of @xmath25 in that case .    from the other hand , for many types of effective potentials the gradient of the potential can be expressed as a function of the potential itself . consider massive scalar field with @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is a mass , and rewrite the gradient term with the help of ( [ eq1 ] ) @xmath28 this expression can be used in order to reduce the dimension of the dynemical system until it does not change sign .",
    "this is true for the whole evolution of the dynamical system during bounces and inflation , described e.g. in @xcite . in that case",
    "the system can be reduced to three - dimensional one with the following dynamical variables @xmath29 .",
    "the possibility of bounce emerges within semi - classical lqc since the phase space differs essentially from the case of gr for small scale factors due to quantum corrections .",
    "the function @xmath30 can change sign in ( [ hdot ] ) so the hubble parameter derivative may vanish . in the case of massless scalar field equality @xmath31 determines the singular point of the dynamical system .",
    "the right hand side of equation ( [ dh ] ) ( see below ) should be used in order to determine the singular point position with fixed value of the effective potential-[eq3 ] ) .",
    "for instance the usual focus at @xmath32 , which is responsible for oscillations of the scalar field after inflation , is ignored . ] .",
    "it is the saddle singular point on the @xmath33 axis in the phase space that ensures the bounce for solutions of cosmological equations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] left ) .",
    "one can see that the bounce is guaranteed for all phase trajectories crossing the @xmath33 axis above the saddle @xmath34 , since the hubble parameter changes sign from negative to positive and the transition from contraction to expansion takes place .",
    "the position of the saddle @xmath34 for massless scalar field depends on quantization parameter as @xmath35 with nonvanishing potential it depends on the value of the effective potential very weakly . only for very large @xmath1 with large @xmath36",
    "the position of the saddle is shifted a little towards smaller values .     just to visualize the saddle .",

    "this means that trajectories laying below the point @xmath34 appear in the region of semi - classical lqc for @xmath42 .",
    "these trajectories do not have bounce since they describe transition from expansion to contraction .",
    "however , these trajectories originate from and come back to the rigion below @xmath38 where purely quantum geometric effects should be responsible for the absence of singularity @xcite .",
    "assume below that the saddle singular point @xmath34 lies below the scale @xmath38 , or , equivalently , @xmath43 and @xmath37 .",
    "assume in this section that the effective potential of the scalar field is completely flat , i.e. @xmath44=const .",

    "its position dependence on the value of parameter @xmath1 , determined empirically , is @xmath48 therefore , @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "this means , oscillating behavior of cosmological models with massless scalar field found in @xcite is very generic . from the other hand , @xmath51 when @xmath42 , i.e. when the saddle of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] enters the scale of semi - classical lqc .",
    "however , this does not change the qualitative picture of oscillations since the asymptotes of the saddle are almost horizontal for small @xmath1 and almost all phase trajectories experience a bounce .",

    "the saddle @xmath56 here originates from the fact that @xmath31 in ( [ dh ] ) in classical limit and the bounce becomes possible for sufficiently large @xmath36 .",
    "the thick curve surrounds the region where bounce is impossible since the scalar field derivative gets complex and solutions are absent .",
    "phase trajectories corresponding to bouncing solutions can cross the @xmath33 axis only between points @xmath57 and @xmath56 . at the point",
    "@xmath57 the derivative of the scalar field vanishes .",
    "stability of solutions of this type were studied in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that they are exponentially unstable .",
    "the structure of the phase space depends on some critical value of the potential @xmath58 , so if @xmath59 some singular points disappear .",
    "the value @xmath58 is empirically @xmath60 central figure describes the phase space for @xmath61 .",
    "there are two singular points at the axis @xmath33 , the focus @xmath47 and the saddle @xmath56 .",
    "the presence of additional saddle @xmath34 below @xmath38 still guarantees the bounce for all solutions .",
    "there are two types of possible solutions : oscillating solutions , when the scale factor at the bounce @xmath62 lies between @xmath47 and @xmath63 ( the point where the saddle separatrix bounces ) , or otherwise quasi - exponential bouncing solutions .",
    "right figure corresponds to @xmath59 .",
    "both @xmath47 and @xmath56 disappear and the bounce below @xmath57 now possible for all solutions .",
    "notice the difference between left and right figures .",
    "instability of bouncing solutions within gr is due to the fact that the saddle separatrices have de sitter asymptotes like all solutions .",
    "corresponding separatrices do not have de sitter asymptotic within semi - classical lqc and the class of bouncing solutions is much wider .",
    "it is of interest to consider the dependence of positions of @xmath56 and @xmath47 on the values of @xmath1 and @xmath36 .",
    "notice , that although there is dependence on @xmath1 , the qualitative results remain the same for a wide range of quantization parameter variation .",
    "assume first @xmath39 and study only dependence of singular points positions on @xmath36 .",
    "the result is shown at fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    .",
    "there are three cases : the function @xmath64 crosses the axis @xmath33 in two points ( yellow and black curves ) , in one point ( blue and red curves ) and does not cross the @xmath33 axis ( green curve ) .",
    "the effective potential grows from yellow to black curves .",
    "right figure : dependence of singular points positions on the value of @xmath36 . above the thick curve @xmath24 is complex and there are no solutions . at the point",
    "@xmath65 the singular points disappear and at the point @xmath66 they appear again .",
    "the thick curve marks the scale factor values for which the scalar field derivative @xmath24 vanishes.,width=576 ]    left figure here represents positions of singular points on axis @xmath33 dependence on the scale factor for fixed @xmath36 .",
    "the potential has minimal value for yellow curve and grows monotonically for red , green , blue and black curves .",
    "there are three cases : two points @xmath56 and @xmath47 are present , only one point is left , no singular points are left .",
    "this situation is additionally illustrated on the right figure .",
    "for purely massless scalar field @xmath46 , the point @xmath56 goes to infinity and we come to the phase portrait represented at fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right ) . for small effective potentials",
    "both singular points appear in the phase space .",
    "the position of @xmath47 depends on @xmath36 rather weakly while the position of @xmath56 is very sensitive to it . above the thick curve",
    "the scalar field derivative becomes complex .",
    "although the two singular points come to the phase space for large @xmath36 again , they lie in the region of complex @xmath24 .",
    "now we are ready to describe the behavior of cosmological models with massive scalar field within semi - classical lqc .",
    "although the phase space is four - dimensional , as mentioned at the end of section 2 , we can use ( [ dvdf ] ) to reduce its dimension to three until the oscillations of the scalar field after inflation are not considered .    since the bounce is ensured by the presence of the saddle @xmath34 below the quantum geometry scale @xmath38 it is convenient to consider initial conditions at the bounce where @xmath67 . from the results of the previous section it follows that the picture of bounce is completely determined by the value of the scale factor and effective potential at the bounce .",
    "when @xmath68 , where @xmath58 is given by ( [ vc ] ) there are two singular points in the section of the phase space @xmath25 and oscillations develop if the scale factor lies between the points @xmath47 and @xmath63 .",
    "however , during oscillations the value of the scalar field increases ( if @xmath69 ) or decreases ( when @xmath70 ) and the scalar field climbs the potential walls @xcite .",
    "so in the section @xmath25 of the phase space the singular points @xmath47 and @xmath56 tend to each other until the value of the potential reaches the critical value @xmath58 . when @xmath71 possibility of oscillations disappear and the phase trajectory inevitably escapes from the bounded region near the point @xmath47 .",
    "the scale factor starts to grow quasi - exponentially , and the solution approaches classical region so inflationary regime of gr develops . when inflationary expansion begins the kinetic energy of the scalar field becomes suppressed and the subsequent expansion is determined by slow - roll of the scalar field .",
    "notice that the less is the scalar field mass ( the more flat is the potential ) , the more oscillations can develop before the inflationary stage begins .",
    "when @xmath72 there are no oscillations and the bounce is unique .    the same qualitative behavior should take place for all symmetric nonnegative effective potentials of the scalar field .",
    "it is interesting to note , that the possibility of bounce for zero curvature models ( @xmath73 ) appears in semi - classical lqc with negative potentials .",
    "the phase portrait of zero curvature model with @xmath74 is similar to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right ) .",
    "notice at last , that the validity of the phase analisys presented here is limited . for @xmath75 for instance",
    "the quantum nature of the scalar field becomes important .",
    "also the hubble parameter is constrained by the usual condition @xmath76 .",
    "finally , the requirement @xmath41 should be satisfied .",
    "qualitative study of dynamical system corresponding to semi - classical lqc equations is performed .",
    "it is shown , that the bouncing character of cosmological solutions within semi - classical lqc is guaranteed by the presence of the saddle singular point on the scale factor axis .",
    "the bounce takes place for all solutions already in semi - classical region of lqc if @xmath37 .",
    "although some ` singular ' solutions appear in semi - classical region for @xmath42 they should be free of singularity due to quantum descrete structure of spacetime @xcite which is not considered here . the possibility of oscillations before the bounce in models with massive scalar field is explained .",
    "it is shown that initially oscillating solutions inevitably followed by the inflationary stage .",
    "the bounce is possible also for zero curvature models within semi - classical lqc with negative potentials .",
