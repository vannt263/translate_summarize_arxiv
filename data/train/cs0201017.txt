    "the advent of internet markets has spurred new interest in auctions .",
    "most work in both economics and computer science has concentrated on the design of auction protocols from the seller s perspective , and in particular on optimal ( i.e. , revenue maximizing ) auction design . in this paper",
    "we present a class of systems to assist sets of bidders , _ bidding clubs .",
    "_ the idea is similar to the idea behind `` buyer clubs '' on the internet ( e.g. , @xmath0 ) : to aggregate the market power of individual bidders .",
    "buyer clubs work when buyers interests are perfectly aligned ; the more buyers join in a purchase the lower the price for everyone . in auctions held on the internet",
    "it is relatively easy for multiple agents to cooperate , hiding behind a single auction participant .",
    "intuitively , these bidders can gain by causing others to lower their bids in the case of a first - price auction or by possibly removing the second - highest bidder in the case of a second - price auction .",
    "however , the situation in auctions is not as simple as in buyer clubs , because while bidders can gain by sharing information , the competitive nature of auctions means that bidders interests are not aligned .",
    "thus there is a complex strategic relationship among bidders in a bidding club , and bidding club rules must be designed accordingly .      while there is relative scarcity of previous work on bidder - centric mechanisms ,",
    "certainly our work has not been carried out in a vacuum .",
    "below we discuss the most relevant previous work and its relation to ours .",
    "this work all comes under the umbrella of _ collusion _ in auctions , a negative term still reflecting a seller - oriented perspective .",
    "we adopt a more neutral stance towards such bidder activities and thus use the term _ bidding clubs _ rather than the terms _ bidding rings _ and _ cartels _ that have been used in the past . however , the technical development is not impacted by such subtle differences in moral attitude .",
    "one of the first formal papers to consider collusion in second - price auctions was written by graham and marshall @xcite .",
    "this paper introduces a knockout procedure : agents announce their bids in a pre - auction ; only the highest bidder goes to the auction but this bidder must pay a `` ring center '' the amount of his gain relative to the case where there was no collusion .",
    "the ring center pays each agent in advance ; the amount of this payment is calculated so that the ring center will budget - balance _ ex - ante _ , before knowing the agents valuations .    graham and marshall s work has been extended to deal with variations in the knockout procedure , differential payments , and relations to the shapley value @xcite .",
    "the case where only some of the agents are part of the cartel is discussed by mailath and zemsky @xcite .",
    "ungern and sternberg @xcite discuss collusion in second - price auctions where the designated winner of a cartel is not the agent with the highest valuation . finally ,",
    "although this fact is not presented in any existing work of which we are aware , it is also easy to extend graham and marshall s protocol to handle an environment where multiple cartels may operate in the same auction alongside independent bidders .",
    "overall , a much richer body of work deals with second - price auctions than with first - price auctions .",
    "this is possibly explained by the fact that since second - price auctions give rise to dominant strategies , it is possible to study collusion in many settings related to these auctions without performing strategic equilibrium analysis .      the key exception to the scarcity of formal work on first - price auctions is a very influential paper by mcafee and mcmillan @xcite .",
    "it is the closest in the literature to our work , and indeed we have borrowed some modelling elements from it .",
    "several sections of their paper , including the discussion of enforcement and the argument for independent private values as a model of agents valuations , are directly applicable to our paper .",
    "however , the setting introduced in their work assumes that a fixed number of agents participate in the auction and that all agents are part of a single cartel that coordinates its behavior in the auction .",
    "the authors show optimal collusion protocols for `` weak '' cartels ( in which transfers between agents are not permitted : all bidders bid the reserve price , using the auctioneer s tie - breaking rule to randomly select a winner ) and for `` strong '' cartels ( the cartel holds a pre - auction , the winner of which bids the reserve price in the main auction while all other bidders sit out ; the winner distributes some of his gains to other cartel members through side payments ) . a small part of the paper deals with the case where in addition to the single cartel there are also additional agents .",
    "however , results are shown only for two cases : ( 1 ) when non - cartel members bid without taking the existence of a cartel into account and ( 2 ) when each agent @xmath1 has valuation @xmath2 .",
    "the authors explain that they do not attempt to deal with general strategic behavior in the case where the cartel consists of only a subset of the agents ; furthermore , they do not consider the case where multiple cartels can operate in the same auction .",
    "finally , a brief presentation of `` cartel - formation games '' is related to our discussion of agents decision of whether or not to accept an invitation to join a bidding club .",
    "less formal discussion of collusion in auctions can be found in a wide variety of papers .",
    "for example , a survey paper that discusses mechanisms that are likely to facilitate collusion in auctions , as well as methods for the detection of such schemes , can be found in @xcite . a discussion and comparison of the stability of rings associated with classical auctions",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "that paper concentrates on the case where the valuations of agents in the cartel are honestly reported .",
    "collusion is also discussed in other settings .",
    "for example , the literature discusses collusion that aims to influence purchaser behavior in a repeated procurement setting ( see @xcite ) , and in the context of general bertrand or cournot competition ( see @xcite ) .    we should also mention that in an earlier paper we have anticipated some of the results reported here . specifically , in @xcite we considered bidding clubs under the assumptions that only a single bidding club exists , and that bidders who were not invited to join the club are not aware of the possibility that a bidding club might exist .",
    "the current paper is an extension and generalization of that earlier work .",
    "our goal in this work is to study cooperation between self - interested bidders in a rich model that captures many of the characteristics of auctions on the internet .",
    "this leads to many differences between our model and models proposed in the work surveyed above ( particularly @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , we argue that a model of an internet auction setting that includes bidding clubs should include the following features :    1 .",
    "the number of bidders is stochastic .",
    "2 .   there is no minimum number of bidders in a bidding club ( i.e. , bidding clubs are not required to contain all bidders ) .",
    "3 .   there is no limit to the number of bidding clubs in a single auction .",
    "club members and independent bidders behave strategically , acting according to correct beliefs about this complex environment .",
    "the first feature above is crucial . in many real - world internet auctions ,",
    "bidders are not aware of the number of other agents in the economic environment .",
    "a bidding club that drops one or more interested bidders is thus undetectable to other bidders in an internet auction .",
    "an economic environment with a fixed number of bidders would not model this uncertainty , as the number of interested bidders would be common knowledge among all bidders regardless of the number of bids received in the auction .",
    "for this reason , we consider economic environments where the number of bidders is chosen at random .",
    "we make use of a model of auctions with stochastic numbers of participants which is due to mcafee and mcmillan @xcite ; we also refer to equilibrium analysis of this model by harstad , kagel and levin @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , a scenario with bidding clubs has the following structure :    1 .",
    "given a primary auction ; 2 .",
    "given a set of bidders in that auction , drawn randomly from a set of potential bidders ; 3 .",
    "given a partition of bidders into disjoint _",
    "clubs , _ each of which can be the redundant singleton club ; 4 .   each bidder chooses whether to bid in the primary auction directly or through his club ( it is assumed that this choice is strictly enforceable ) . in the latter case",
    ", the bidder declares his valuation to the club coordinator ; 5 .   based on the bidders choices and declarations each club bids in the primary auction , as do both the bidders who elected not to join their respective clubs and the singleton bidders .",
    "each ( non - singleton ) club bids according to pre - specified , commonly known rules .",
    "these rules also specify internal allocations and possible monetary transfers among club members upon the conclusion of the primary auction .    to make bidding clubs a more realistic model of collusion in internet auctions , we restrict bidding club protocols in the following ways :    1 .   participation in bidding clubs requires an invitation , but bidders must be free to decline this invitation without ( direct ) penalty . in this way",
    "we include the choice to collude as one of agents strategic decisions , rather than starting from the assumption that agents will collude .",
    "bidding club coordinators must make money on expectation , and must never lose money .",
    "[ makemoney ] this ensures that third - parties have incentive to run bidding club coordinators .",
    "note that this requirement is not satisfied by a @xcite - type result , in which bidding clubs ( or , in their parlance , cartels ) are budget balanced _ ex ante _ , but may lose money in individual auctions .",
    "3 .   the bidding club protocol must give rise to an equilibrium where all invited agents choose to participate , even when the bidding club operates in a single auction as opposed to a sequence of auctions .",
    "this means that agents can not be induced to collude in a given auction by the threat of being denied future opportunities to collude .",
    "this paper consists of two parts .",
    "first , sections [ auctionmodel ] through [ asymm - section ] present relevant background that does not directly concern cooperation between bidders . in section [ auctionmodel ]",
    "we give a formal model of an auction with a stochastic number of participants based on the model in @xcite .",
    "we set up an economic environment in which a finite number of agents is chosen at random from an infinite set of potential agents .",
    "we also give a general model of auction mechanisms based on @xcite , and define symmetric bayes - nash equilibria for the resulting bayesian game . in section [ first - price - intro ] we consider different variations on the first - price auction mechanism .",
    "we begin with classical first - price auctions , in which the number of bidders is common knowledge , and then consider first - price auctions in the economic environment from section [ auctionmodel ] , where the number of bidders is drawn from a known distribution . combining results from both auction types , we present first - price auctions with participation revelation : auctions in which the number of bidders is stochastic , but the auctioneer announces the number of participants before taking bids .",
    "this is the auction mechanism upon which we will base our bidding club protocol for first - price auctions .",
    "finally , section [ asymm - section ] makes use of the revelation principle to show a class of auction mechanisms in which bidders are subject to different payment rules and may have different private information ( in addition to their valuations ) , yet all bid truthfully .",
    "we think that this result is interesting in its own right , and certainly it is applicable to settings other than collusion ; however , it is also necessary to the proof of the main theorem in section [ first - price ] .",
    "the second part of our paper is concerned explicitly with bidding clubs , using material from the first part to present a general model of bidding clubs and then a bidding club protocol for first - price auctions .",
    "first , section [ biddingclubs ] expands the economic environment from section [ auctionmodel ] to include the following novel features :    * a finite set of bidding clubs is selected from an infinite set of potential bidding clubs .",
    "* a finite set of agents is selected to participate in the auction , from an infinite set of potential agents .",
    "some agents are associated with bidding clubs , and the whole procedure is carried out in such a way that no agent can gain information about the total number of agents in the economic environment from the fact of his own selection . * the space of agent types",
    "is expanded to include both an agent s valuation , and the number of agents present in that agent s bidding club ( equal to one if the agent does not belong to a bidding club ) .",
    "we introduce notation to describe each agent s beliefs about the number of agents in the economic environment , conditioned on that agent s private information .",
    "we also augment the auction mechanism from section [ auctionmodel ] to describe additional strategic choices available to agents invited to bidding clubs . in section [ first - price ] we examine bidding club protocols for first - price auctions .",
    "we begin with two assumptions on the distribution of agent valuations : the first related to continuity of the distribution , and the second to monotonicity of equilibrium bids .",
    "after a technical lemma relating equilibrium bids in auctions with stochastic numbers of participants under different distributions , we give a bidding club protocol for first - price auctions with participation revelation .",
    "our main technical results follow :    * we show that it is an equilibrium for agents to accept invitations to join bidding clubs when invited and to disclose their true valuations to their bidding club s coordinator . under the same equilibrium ,",
    "singleton agents bid as they would in an auction with a stochastic number of participants in an economic environment without bidding clubs , in which the distribution over the number of participants is the same as in the bidding clubs setting . * in equilibrium",
    "each agent is better off as a result of his own club ( that is , his expected payoff is higher than would have been the case if his club never existed , but other clubs  if any  still did exist ) . *",
    "in equilibrium each club increases all non - members expected payoffs , as compared to equilibrium in the case where all club members participated in the auction as singleton bidders , but all other clubs  if any  still existed .",
    "* in equilibrium each agent s expected payoff is identical to the case in which no clubs exist ; note that since clubs make money on expectation , if clubs are willing to make money ( or break even ) only on expectation , they could distribute some of their _ ex ante _ expected profits among the club members , ensuring that all bidders gain on expectation .",
    "finally , sections [ discussion ] and [ conclusion ] consist of discussion and conclusions .",
    "we touch on questions of trustworthiness of coordinators , legality of bidding clubs and steps an auctioneer could take to disrupt the operation of bidding clubs in her auction .",
    "in this section we provide a ( non - controversial ) auction model , meant to capture an internet auction setting such as ebay .",
    "of course , this model is applicable to many other auctions as well .",
    "auctions may be seen as consisting of an economic environment plus an auction mechanism which together define a bayesian game . first , our economic environment consists of a stochastic number of agents , each of which has private information about the number of participants in the auction and knows the distribution from which others types are drawn .",
    "this section draws heavily on work by mcafee and mcmillan @xcite on auctions with a stochastic number of participants .",
    "second , the game includes an auction mechanism in which the agents participate ; this section is based on @xcite . after defining these elements , we give a formal definition of the bayesian game .",
    "an economic environment @xmath3 consists of a finite set of agents who have non - negative valuations for a good at auction , and a distinguished agent @xmath4the seller or center .",
    "the set of agents is selected by an exogenous process , and each agent is unaware of the total number of agents participating in the economic environment . following @xcite , let the set of agents who may participate in the economic environment be @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 represent the probability that a finite set @xmath7 is the set of agents .",
    "the probability that @xmath8 agents agents participate in the auction we do not count the distinguished agent @xmath4 , who is always present .",
    "] will participate in the auction is @xmath9 .",
    "all agents know the probability distribution @xmath6 .",
    "once an agent @xmath10 is selected , he updates his probability of the number of agents present as :    @xmath11    we deviate from the model in @xcite by adding the assumption that it is common knowledge that all bidders are equally likely to be chosen .",
    "hence @xmath12 is the same for all @xmath10 ; we will hereafter refer only to @xmath13 .",
    "finally , we assume that @xmath14 ; at least two agents will participate in the auction .",
    "let @xmath15 be the set of possible agent types .",
    "the type @xmath16 of agent @xmath1 is the tuple @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 denotes an agent s valuation : his maximal willingness to pay for the good offered by the center .",
    "we assume that @xmath18 represents a purely private valuation for the good , and that @xmath18 is selected independently from the other @xmath19 s of other agents from a known distribution , @xmath20 , having density function @xmath21 . by @xmath22",
    "we denote agent @xmath1 s signal : his private information about the number of agents in the auction . in this section",
    "we will consider the simple case where @xmath23 : it is common knowledge that all agents receive the null signal , and hence gain no additional information about the number of agents .",
    "note , however , that the economic environment itself is always common knowledge , and so agents always have some information about the number of agents even when they receive the null signal .",
    "we will consider more complex signals in section [ biddingclubs ] .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath24 to denote the probability that agent @xmath1 assigns to there being @xmath8 agents in the auction , conditioned on his type @xmath25 . throughout the paper we will use uppercase @xmath26 to denote the whole probability distribution as compared to the probability of a particular number of agents which we have denoted by lowercase @xmath27 ; in this case we denote the whole distribution conditioned on @xmath1 s type as @xmath28 .    the utility function of agent @xmath1 , @xmath29 is linear , normalized with @xmath30 .",
    "the utility of agent @xmath1 ( having valuation @xmath18 ) when asked to pay @xmath31 is @xmath32 if @xmath1 is allocated a good , and it is @xmath4 otherwise .",
    "thus , we assume that there are no externalities in agents valuations and that agents are risk - neutral .",
    "we denote the possible allocations of the good to the agents by @xmath33 .",
    "an auction mechanism is a tuple @xmath34 , where :    * @xmath35 is the set of possible messages an agent may send .",
    "* @xmath36 is an allocation function where @xmath37 is the tuple of distribution functions over @xmath33 ( e.g. , the allocation may include random elements ) .",
    "* @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the ( monetary ) transfer function for agent @xmath1 .",
    "notice that @xmath8 is a parameter .",
    "technically , an auction mechanism defines @xmath40 and @xmath31 for any number of participants , and can be therefore considered as a set of tuples ( one for each number of agents ) .",
    "given the above , the dynamics of an auction mechanism can be described as follows :    * each agent @xmath1 sends a message @xmath41 to the center .",
    "we denote the set of messages received by the center as @xmath42 . * the center conducts a lottery according to the distribution @xmath43 , and selects the allocation @xmath44 .",
    "* agent @xmath1 gets @xmath45 , and is required to transfer @xmath46 to the center . *",
    "the utility of @xmath1 is @xmath47 if he is assigned a good , and it is @xmath48 otherwise .",
    "the auction mechanism @xmath34 , in conjunction with the economic environment @xmath3 , defines a bayesian game .",
    "we will use the following definitions and notation .",
    "a strategy @xmath49 for agent @xmath1 is a mapping from his type @xmath25 to a message @xmath41",
    ". this may be the null message , which means that he has elected not to participate in the auction .",
    "@xmath50 denotes the set of possible strategies , i.e. , the set of functions from types to messages in @xmath35 .",
    "each agent s type is that agent s private information , but the whole setting is common knowledge . for notational simplicity",
    "we only define symmetric equilibria , where all agents bid the same function of their type , as this is sufficient for our purposes in this paper",
    ". a more general definition would proceed along the same lines . by @xmath51",
    "we denote agent @xmath1 s _ ex post _ expected utility given that his type is @xmath25 , he follows the strategy @xmath52 and all other agents use the strategy @xmath53 , in the case that there are a total of @xmath54 agents .",
    "the strategy profile @xmath55 is a symmetric equilibrium if and only if :    @xmath56",
    "in this section we discuss several different variants of the first - price auction .",
    "first we describe classical first - price auctions , in which a fixed number of participants belong to the economic environment , and hence the number of bidders is common knowledge . next we consider first - price auctions with a stochastic number of participants , where the number of bidders in the economic environment is drawn from a known distribution . using the previous two settings , we present first - price auctions with participation revelation , where the number of agents is chosen stochastically , but the auctioneer announces the number of agents who have registered in the auction before taking bids .",
    "this last type of first - price auction is the one we will consider in our discussion of bidding clubs in section [ first - price ] .      in a classical first - price auction ,",
    "each participant submits a bid in a sealed envelope .",
    "the agent with the highest bid wins the good and pays the amount of his bid , and all other participants pay nothing . in the case of a tie",
    ", the winner of the auction is selected uniformly at random from the bidders who tied for the highest bid .",
    "( note , however , that when @xmath20 is continuous and has no atoms the probability of two bidders having the same type is @xmath4 ; ties will therefore occur with probability @xmath4 if bidders follow an equilibrium in which they all bid a strictly monotonically - increasing function of their valuations . )",
    "the equilibrium analysis of first - price auctions is quite standard :    if valuations are selected independently according to the uniform distribution on @xmath57 $ ] then it is a symmetric equilibrium for each agent @xmath1 to follow the strategy :    @xmath58    using classical equilibrium analysis ( e.g. , following riley and samuelson @xcite ) it is possible to show how classical first - price auctions can be generalized to an arbitrary continuous distribution @xmath20 .",
    "[ prop - first - fixed]if valuations are selected from a continuous distribution @xmath20 then it is a symmetric equilibrium for each agent @xmath1 to follow the strategy :    @xmath59    .    in both cases ,",
    "observe that although @xmath8 is a free variable , @xmath8 is not a parameter of the strategy ; the same is true of the distribution @xmath20 .",
    "agents deduce this information from their full knowledge of the economic environment .",
    "it is useful , however , to have notation specifying the amount of the equilibrium bid as a function of both @xmath60 and @xmath8 .",
    "we write    @xmath61      in the economic environment described in section [ econenviron ] the number of agents is not a constant ; rather , it is chosen stochastically from a known probability distribution .",
    "an equilibrium for this setting was demonstrated by harstad , kagel and levin @xcite :    [ propstochastic]if valuations are selected from a continuous distribution @xmath20 and the number of bidders is selected from the distribution @xmath26 then it is a symmetric equilibrium for each agent @xmath1 to follow the strategy :    @xmath62    observe that @xmath63 is the amount of the equilibrium bid for a bidder with valuation @xmath18 in a setting with @xmath54 bidders as described in section [ classicalfirstprice ] above .",
    "@xmath26 is deduced from the economic environment .",
    "is a set : @xmath64 for all @xmath65 , where @xmath66 denotes the probability that the economic environment contains exactly @xmath54 agents . ]",
    "we overload our previous notation for the equilibrium bid , this time as a function of the agent s valuation and the probability distribution @xmath26 .",
    "thus we write :    @xmath67    we will make frequent use of this function throughout the paper",
    ". an important note is that it describes the equilibrium bid in the situation where the economic environment is such that the number of agents is chosen by @xmath26 and where all agents receive the null signal .",
    "in some first - price auctions ( e.g. , auctions held on the internet ) , bidders participate in an economic environment where the number of bidders in the auction is not common knowledge .",
    "however , this can be helpful information for bidders .",
    "one obvious way of addressing this problem is to introduce a two - phase mechanism with revelation of the number of participants between the stages .",
    "specifically , a first - price auction with participation revelation is as follows :    1 .",
    "agents indicate their intention to bid in the auction .",
    "2 .   the auctioneer announces @xmath8 , the number of agents who registered in the first phase .",
    "agents submit bids to the auctioneer .",
    "the auctioneer will only accept bids from agents who registered in the first phase .",
    "the agent who submitted the highest bid is awarded the good for the amount of his bid ; all other agents are made to pay 0 .",
    "it is unsurprising that , although a first - price auction with participation revelation may have a stochastic number of participants ,    [ prop - participationrevelation ] there exists an equilibrium of the first - price auction with participation revelation where every agent @xmath1 indicates the intention to participate and bids according to @xmath68 .",
    "agents are always better off participating in first - price auctions as long as there is no participation fee .",
    "the only way of participating is to declare the intention to participate in the first phase of the auction .",
    "thus the number of agents announced by the auctioneer is equal to the total number of agents in the economic environment . from proposition",
    "[ prop - first - fixed ] it is best for agent @xmath1 to bid @xmath68 when it is common knowledge that the number of agents in the economic environment is @xmath8 .",
    "that is exactly the case under our mechanism .    in section",
    "[ first - price ] we will be concerned with first - price auctions with information revelation , but we will show an equilibrium in which the number of agents registering in the first phase is smaller than the total number of agents participating in the auction , because some bidders with low valuations drop out as part of a collusive agreement .",
    "the auctioneer s declaration acts as a signal about the total number of bidders , but individual agents will still be uncertain about the total number of opponents they face .",
    "in this section we describe a particular class of auction mechanisms that are asymmetric in the sense that every agent is subject to the same allocation rule but to a potentially different payment rule , and furthermore that agents may receive different signals",
    ". it will be helpful for the proof of our main theorem in section [ first - price ] to show that a truth - revealing equilibrium exists in such auctions under the following two conditions :    1 .",
    "the auction allocates the good to the agent who submits the highest bid .",
    "2 .   consider the auction @xmath69 in which _ all _ agents are subject to agent @xmath1 s payment rule and the above allocation rule , and where ( hypothetically ) _ all _ agents receive the signal @xmath22 . in the real auction , we create an agent @xmath10 in the hypothetical auction @xmath69 having type @xmath70 .",
    "] truth - revelation is a symmetric equilibrium in @xmath69 .",
    "observe that the second condition above is less restrictive than it may appear . from the revelation principle",
    "we can see that for every auction with a symmetric equilibrium there is a corresponding auction in which truth - revealing is an equilibrium that gives rise to the same allocation and the same payments for all agents .",

    "let @xmath71 represent a set of auctions @xmath72 @xmath73 which all allocate the good to the agent who submits the highest bid , and which are all truth - revealing direct mechanisms for @xmath8 risk - neutral agents with independent private valuations drawn from the same distribution .",
    "we now define another auction @xmath74 :    1 .",
    "each agent @xmath1 sends a message @xmath41 to the center .",
    "the center allocates the good to the agent @xmath1 with @xmath75 .",

    "assume that the other agents are truth revealing , then the other agents behavior , the allocation rule , and agent @xmath1 s payment rule are all identical in @xmath74 and @xmath69 .",

    "intuitively , this lemma asserts that the symmetric equilibrium bid is always higher when more agents belong to the main auction as singleton bidders and the total number of agents is held constant .",
    "recall our second assumption from section [ assumption ] .",
    "we defined @xmath111 as the proposition that @xmath112 .",
    "our second assumption was that @xmath113 implies that @xmath114 .",
    "it is thus sufficient to show that @xmath115 .",
    "we will take @xmath116 .",
    "first we will show that @xmath117 .",
    "the distribution @xmath118 expresses the belief that there are @xmath119 potential coordinators , the membership of which is distributed as described in section [ bcenvironment ] , and one potential coordinator that is known to contain only a single bidder .",
    "the distribution @xmath100 expresses the belief that there are @xmath120 potential coordinators , the membership of which is again distributed as described in section [ bcenvironment ] , and one potential coordinator that is known to contain exactly @xmath10 bidders . under both distributions",
    "it is certain that there are at least @xmath121 agents .",
    "therefore @xmath122 .",
    "second , @xmath123 , @xmath124 .",
    "considering @xmath118 , observe that for @xmath119 of the potential coordinators the probability that this coordinator contains a single agent is less than one and these probabilities are all independent ; the last potential coordinator contains a single agent with probability one . considering @xmath100",
    ", there are @xmath120 potential coordinators where the probability of containing a single agent is less than one , exactly as above , and @xmath10 potential coordinators certain to contain exactly one agent .",
    "thus the two distributions agree exactly about @xmath120 of the potential coordinators , which both hold to contain more than a single agent , and likewise both distributions agree that one of the potential coordinators contains exactly one agent",
    ". however , there remain @xmath125 potential coordinators about which the distributions disagree ; @xmath118 always generates a greater or equal number of agents for these potential coordinators , as compared to @xmath100 . under the latter distribution",
    "all these agents are singletons with probability one , while under the former there is positive probability that each of the potential coordinators contains more than one agent .",
    "as long as @xmath126 , there is at least one potential coordinator for which @xmath118 stochastically dominates @xmath100 .",
    "thus @xmath127 .",
    "what follows is the protocol of a coordinator who approaches @xmath10 agents .    1 .",
    "each agent @xmath1 sends a message @xmath41 to the coordinator .",
    "2 .   if at least one agent declines participation then the coordinator registers in the main auction for every agent who accepted the invitation to the bidding club . for each bidder @xmath1",
    ", the coordinator submits a bid of @xmath128 , where @xmath8 is the number of bidders announced by the auctioneer .",
    "if all @xmath10 agents accepted the invitation then the coordinator drops all bidders except the bidder with the highest reported valuation , who we will denote as bidder @xmath129 .",
    "for this bidder the coordinator will place a bid of @xmath130 in the main auction .",
    "if bidder @xmath129 wins in the main auction , he is made to pay @xmath130 to the center and @xmath131 to the coordinator .",
    "we are now ready to prove the main theorem of the paper :    it is an equilibrium for all bidding club members to choose to participate and to truthfully declare their valuations to their respective bidding club coordinators , and for all non - bidding club members to participate in the main auction with a bid of @xmath132.[theorem - firstprice ]    we first prove that the above strategy is in equilibrium for both categories of bidders given that agents all participate ; we then prove that participation is rational for all agents .    for the proof of equilibrium",
    "we consider a one - stage mechanism which behaves as follows :    1 .",
    "the center announces @xmath8 , the number of bidders in the main auction .",
    "2 .   bidders submit bids ( messages ) to the mechanism .",
    "the bidder with the highest bid is allocated the good .",
    "the winning bidder is made to pay @xmath133 .",
    "this one - stage mechanism has the same payment rule for bidding club bidders as the bidding club protocol given above , but no longer implements a first - price payment rule for singleton bidders . in order to prove that the strategies given in the statement of the theorem are an equilibrium ,",
    "it is sufficient to show that truthful bidding is an equilibrium for all bidders under the one - stage mechanism .",
    "observe that this mechanism may be seen as a mechanism @xmath74 in the sense of lemma [ lemma ] : it allocates the good to the agent who submits the highest message , and ( by definition of @xmath134 ) the auction @xmath69 in which _ all _ agents are subject to agent @xmath1 s payment rule and receive the signal @xmath22 has truth revelation as a symmetric equilibrium .    _ strategy of non - club bidder : _ assume that all bidding club agents bid truthfully .",
    "further assume that all non - club agents also bid truthfully except for agent @xmath1 .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath135 correctly describes the beliefs of non - club agents , given the auctioneer s announcement that there are @xmath8 bidders in the main auction .",
    "although agents in bidding clubs have additional information about the number of agents  each agent knows that there is at least one other agent in his own club  their prescribed behavior is to place bids of @xmath136 in the main auction .",
    "agent @xmath1 thus faces a stochastic number of agents distributed according to @xmath135 and all bidding @xmath132 . using the result from lemma [ lemma ] ,",
    "@xmath1 s strategic decision is the same as under a mechanism where all agents are subject to his payment rule and share his signal @xmath22 , and with a stochastic number of bidders distributed according to @xmath135 .",
    "in particular , it does not matter that the club members are subject to different payment rules and have additional information , and so @xmath1 will also bid @xmath132",
    ".    _ strategy of club bidder : _ assume that all agents accept the invitation to join their respective clubs and then truthfully declare their valuations , excluding agent @xmath1 who decides to participate but considers his bid . once again , observe that @xmath1 is in a setting that is exactly described by lemma [ lemma ] : @xmath100 really does describe the distribution over the number of agents given his signal , and the bidder submitting the highest ( global ) message will always be allocated the good .",
    "therefore the information asymmetry does not affect @xmath1 s strategy , and so truthful bidding is a best response for agent @xmath1 .",
    "we now turn to the question of participation ; for this part of the proof we return to the original , multi - stage mechanism .    _ participation of non - club bidder : _ because there is no participation fee , it is always rational for a bidder to participate in a first - price auction .    _",
    "participation of club bidder : _ likewise , because there is no participation fee , all bidding club bidders will participate in the auction , but must decide whether or not to accept their coordinators invitations .",
    "assume that all agents except for @xmath1 join their respective clubs and bid truthfully , and agent @xmath1 must decide whether or not to join his bidding club .",
    "agent @xmath1 knows the number of agents in his bidding club and updates his distribution over the number of agents in the whole auction as @xmath100 .",
    "consider the classical stochastic case where all bidders have the same information as @xmath1 ( and are subject to the same payment rules ) : from proposition [ propstochastic ] it is a best response for @xmath1 to bid @xmath137 . in",
    "this setting @xmath1 s expected gain is the same as in the equilibrium where all bidding club members ( including @xmath1 ) join their clubs and bid truthfully , by corollary [ asymm - cor ] .    as a result of @xmath1 declining the offer to participate in the bidding club there are @xmath120 bidders in the main auction placing bids of @xmath138 and @xmath125 other bidders placing bids of @xmath139 .",
    "note that this occurs because the singleton bidders and other bidding clubs in the main auction follow a strategy that depends on the number of bidders announced by the auctioneer ; hence they bid as though all the @xmath125 bidders from the disbanded bidding club might each be independent bidding clubs .",
    "we know from lemma [ assumptionlemma ] that @xmath140 .",
    "thus the singleton bidders and other bidding clubs will bid a higher function of their valuations than the bidders from the disbanded bidding club .",
    "it always reduces a bidder s expected gain in a first - price auction to cause other bidders to bid above the equilibrium , because it reduces the chance that he will win without affecting his payment if he does win .",
    "this is exactly the effect of @xmath1 declining the offer to join his bidding club : the @xmath125 other bidders from @xmath1 s bidding club bid according to the equilibrium of the classical stochastic case discussed above , but the @xmath120 singleton and bidding club bidders submit bids that exceed the symmetric equilibrium amount . therefore @xmath1 s expected gain is smaller if he declines the offer to participate than if he accepts it .      we can show that bidders are better off being invited to a bidding club than being sent to the auction as singleton bidders .",
    "intuitively , an agent gains by not having to consider the possibility that other bidders who would otherwise have belonged to his bidding club might themselves be bidding clubs .",
    "[ theorem - gain - disband ] an agent @xmath1 has higher expected utility in a bidding club of size @xmath10 bidding as described in theorem [ theorem - firstprice ] than he does if the bidding club does not exist and @xmath10 additional agents ( including @xmath1 ) participate directly in the main auction as singleton bidders , again bidding as described in theorem [ theorem - firstprice ] .",
    "consider the counterfactual case where agent @xmath1 s bidding club does not exist , and all the members of this bidding club become singleton bidders .",

    "if he belonged to the bidding club and followed the same equilibrium @xmath1 would bid @xmath137 . in both cases",
    "the auction is economically efficient , which means @xmath1 is better off in the auction that requires him to pay a smaller amount when he wins .",
    "lemma [ assumptionlemma ] shows that @xmath142 , and so our result follows .",
    "we can also show that singleton bidders and members of other bidding clubs benefit from the existence of each bidding club in the same sense . following an argument similar to the one in theorem [ theorem - gain - disband ] , other bidders gain from not having to consider the possibility that additional bidders might represent bidding clubs .",
    "paradoxically , other bidders gain from the existence of a given bidding club is greater than the gain of that club s members .    in the equilibrium described in theorem [ theorem - firstprice ] , singleton bidders and members of other bidding clubs",
    "have higher expected utility when other agents participate in a given bidding club of size @xmath143 , as compared to a case where @xmath10 additional agents participate directly in the main auction as singleton bidders .",
    "consider a singleton bidder in the first case , where the club of @xmath10 agents does exist .",
    "( it is sufficient to consider singleton bidders , since other bidding clubs bid in the same way as singleton bidders . )",
    "following the equilibrium from theorem [ theorem - firstprice ] this agent would submit the bid @xmath144 .",

    "thus @xmath146 .",
    "finally , we can show that agents are indifferent between participating in the equilibrium from theorem [ theorem - firstprice ] in a bidding club of size @xmath10 ( thus , where the number of agents is distributed according to @xmath100 ) and participating in an economic environment with a stochastic number of bidders distributed according to @xmath100 , but with no coordinators .    for all @xmath147 , for all @xmath148 ,",

    "; 2 .   participating in a first - price auction with participation revelation in an economic environment with a stochastic number of bidders distributed according to @xmath100 where all bidders receive the null signal , and where there are no coordinators .",
    "first we will show that agent @xmath1 s expected utility in case ( 2 ) above is the same as in a classical first - price auction with a stochastic number of bidders ( i.e. , without participation revelation ) .",
    "second , we will show that agent @xmath1 s expected utility in this classical stochastic setting is the same as in case ( 1 ) above .    from proposition [ prop - participationrevelation ]",
    "it is an equilibrium for agent @xmath1 to bid @xmath63 in a first - price auction with participation revelation ( case ( 2 ) ) , where @xmath54 is the number of bidders announced by the auctioneer .",
    "since the number of agents is distributed according to @xmath100 , the expected payment of agent @xmath1 is @xmath150 .",
    "this is the definition of @xmath137 from equation [ stochasticbid ] . from proposition [ propstochastic ]",
    "this is an equilibrium bid of agent @xmath1 when the number of agents is distributed according to @xmath100 ( without information revelation ) .",
    "since both the classical first - price auction with a stochastic number of bidders and the first - price auction with participation revelation are efficient , agent @xmath1 s expected utility is the same under both auctions .    under the equilibrium from theorem [ theorem - firstprice ] ( case ( 1 ) ) the amount of @xmath1 s payment will be @xmath137 if he wins .",
    "since both the mechanism from case ( 1 ) and the classical first - price auction with a stochastic number of bidders are efficient , agent @xmath1 has the same expected utility in both auctions .",
    "this theorem shows that an agent would be as happy in a world without bidding clubs as he is in our economic environment .",
    "the difference between the two worlds is that in the latter bidding club coordinators make a positive profit on expectation , and indeed never lose money .",
    "that is , in the bidding club economic environment some expected profit is shifted from the auctioneer to the bidding club coordinator(s ) without affecting the bidders expected utility .",
    "we observe that it would be easy for coordinators to redistribute some of these gains to bidders along the lines of the second - price auction protocol proposed by graham and marshall : coordinators make a payment to every bidder who accepts the invitation to join , where the amount of this payment is less than or equal to the _ ex ante _ expected difference that bidder makes to the coordinator s profit . with this modification coordinators would be budget balanced only on expectation ( violating requirement [ makemoney ] from section [ bc - glance ] ) , but agents would strictly prefer the bidding club economic environment to the economic environment in which coordinators are not present .",
    "in this section we consider the trustworthiness and legality of coordinators , and also discuss two ways for auctioneers to disrupt bidding clubs in their auctions",
    ".      why would a bidding club coordinator be willing to provide reliable service , and likewise why would bidders have reason to trust a coordinator ?",
    "for example , a malicious coordination protocol could be used simply to drop all its members from the auction and reduce competition .",
    "while this is a reasonable concern , all the bidding club protocols discussed in this paper allow the coordinator to make a profit on expectation .",
    "there is thus incentive for a trusted third party to run a reliable coordination service .",
    "indeed , coordinators would be very inexpensive to run : as their behavior is entirely specified , they could operate without any human supervision .",
    "the establishment of trust is exogenous to our model ; we have simply assumed that all agents trust coordinators and that all coordinators are honest .",
    "we have often been asked about the legal issues surrounding the use of bidding clubs .",
    "while this is an interesting and pertinent question , it exceeds both our expertise and the scope of this paper .",
    "we should note , however , that uses of bidding clubs exist that might not fall under the legal definition of collusion .",
    "for example , a corporation could use a bidding club to choose one of its departments to bid in an external auction . in this way",
    "the corporation could be sure to avoid bidding against itself in the external auction while avoiding dictatorship and respecting each department s self - interest .",
    "coordinators may also be permitted by the auctioneer : e.g. , by an internet market seeking to attract more bidders to its site .",
    "there are two things an auctioneer can do to disrupt bidding clubs in a first - price auction .",
    "first , she can permit `` false - name bidding . ''",
    "our auction model has assumed that each agent may place only a single bid in the auction , and that the center has a way of uniquely identifying agents .",
    "for example , the auctioneer might use user accounts keyed to credit card billing addresses in combination with a reputation ranking , making it impossible for bidders to place bids claiming to originate from different agents .",
    "second , she can refrain from publicly disclosing the winner of the auction",
    ".    if bidders can bid both in their bidding clubs and in the main auction , they are better off deviating from the equilibrium in theorem [ theorem - firstprice ] in the following way .",
    "a bidder @xmath1 can accept the invitation to join the bidding club but place a very low bid with the coordinator ; at the same time , @xmath1 can directly submit a competitive bid in the main auction .",
    "agent @xmath1 will gain by following this strategy when all other agents follow the strategies specified in theorem [ theorem - firstprice ] because accepting the invitation to join the bidding club ensures that the club does drop all but one of its members and also causes the high bidder to bid less than he would if he were not bound to the coordination protocol . if the bidding club drops any bidders other than @xmath1 then all agents bids will also be lowered because the number of participants announced by the auctioneer will be smaller , compared to the case where the bidding club did not exist or where it was disbanded .",
    "however , if false - name bidding is impossible and the winner of the auction is publicly disclosed then the bidding club coordinator can detect an agent who has deviated in this way . because the agent has agreed to participate in the bidding club the coordinator has the power to impose a punitive fine on this agent , making the deviation unprofitable .",
    "if either or both of these requirements does not hold , however , the coordinator will be unable to detect defection and so the equilibrium from theorem [ theorem - firstprice ] will not hold .",
    "we have presented a formal model of bidding clubs which departs in many ways from models traditionally used in the study of collusion ; most importantly , all agents behave strategically based on correct information about the economic environment , including the possibility that other agents will collude",
    ". other features of our setting include a stochastic number of agents and a stochastic number of bidding clubs in each auction .",

    "2 .   would any agent be better off if his bidding club did not exist ?",
    "would any agent would be better off in an economic environment that did not include bidding clubs at all ?    we have showed that agents are strictly better off in the first two senses and no worse off in the last sense ; furthermore , we have described a simple side - payment scheme that would make agents strictly better off in all three senses .",
