    "the relative abundances of various metals can , however , be used to make some inferences about the physical properties of the absorbing medium . in particular , the relative abundances of zinc and chromium , as measured from the zn  ii ( 2026.15,2062.66 ) and cr  ii ( 2056.25 , 2062.23 , 2066.16 ) lines provide a qualitative estimate of the dust to gas ratio in the absorbing clouds . in a study of these lines in damped lyman - alpha systems , pettini _",

    "the cr  ii 2066 line is in a region where it is very difficult to measure the continuum .",
    "based on upper and lower limits on the continuum , we get @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) . from the line ratios",
    ", we can infer that the zn  ii and cr  ii lines are likely not saturated , and we can therefore use the ews to determine the relative abundances of zn and cr .    the cr / zn ratio we measure for the absorbers in the grb  000926 host indicates the host galaxy is depleted in dust relative to the local ism .",
    "the ratio [ cr / zn ] @xmath62 - log[n(cr)/n(zn)]_{\\odot}$ ] for both components of the absorption system is significantly larger than that measured locally . using the oscillator strengths from pettini _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) , we obtain [ cr / zn]@xmath63 and @xmath64 for the two components of the grb absorber , indicating the gas phase abundance of cr is almost a factor 10 higher than in the local ism",
    ". [ cr / zn ] measured for the grb  000926 clouds is in fact quite similar to the range @xmath65 to @xmath66 that pettini _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) obtain for damped ly@xmath3 systems between @xmath67 . for the damped ly@xmath3 systems , pettini _",
    "( 1994 ) conclude that this is due to the depletion of dust in high redshift galaxies .",
    "a similar qualitative statement applies to the grb  000926 host , again assuming that the absorption systems are local to the host .",
    "the fact that @xmath68 $ ] is similar in the absorption spectra of the two clouds indicates the dust depeletion is a characteristic of the galaxy as a whole , rather than of the immediate grb environment .",
    "it has been suggested that grbs reside in gas - rich regions , and the dust in this gas is destroyed by heating and sublimation of the grains by the x - ray and uv flux @xcite ( effective to about 10 pc ) or / and by ejection of electrons by x - rays and subsequent shattering of the grains by the repulsive force of the net charge left @xcite ( effective out to about 100 pc ) .",
    "this suggestion has been used to explain the observation that in a sample of events , the optical extinction towards grbs is lower than one would expect from measured x - ray column densities @xcite .",
    "the postulated destruction of dust takes place locally to the grb , however our measurements find dust to be similarly depleted in clouds that must be separated by much more than 10  pc .",
    "we suggest therefore that the observed x - ray columns result from absorption in the disks of the host galaxies , and that the low extinctions seen in many ot optical spectra are due to the lack of dust in galaxies at these redshifts .",
    "high - resolution absorption spectroscopy of grb  000926 strengthens the case that grbs explode in the disks of galaxies .",
    "the small offset from the center of the host , combined with the evidence for a significant column depth of metals indicates the explosion occurred near the center of a galaxy at redshift @xmath69 .",
    "the two absorption systems seen in the intermediate - resolution spectra , separated by @xmath70  km  s@xmath1 , are most easily interpreted as due to separate clouds within the host galaxy .",
    "the similarity in the properties ( e.g. ratios of metals ) between the two clouds indicates that grbs do not significantly alter their immediate environment .",
    "rather , differences between dust to gas ratios in grb host galaxies to the local sample are most likely due to evolutionary effects .",
    "the ability to measure the ews of a significant number of metal lines in the grb  000926 spectrum suggests that in the future high - resolution studies of optical transients will provide a means of probing the metallicity and dust content of grb hosts . for grb",
    "000926 we were unable to measure the ly@xmath3 line , so we can not directly infer the metal enrichment .",
    "this should , however , be possible in future events . from the ratio of cr / zn it appears that , like other galaxies at similar redshift , the dust to gas ratio is reduced in the grb  000926 host compared to local values . with a larger sample it should be possible to determine if there are any significant differences in metal enrichment and dust depletion in grb host galaxies relative to other distant galaxies ."
