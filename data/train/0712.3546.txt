    "in any attempt to perturbatively quantize gravity as a field theory , higher - derivative interactions must be included in the action .",
    "such terms also arise in the effective low - energy action of string theories",
    ". furthermore , higher - derivative gravity theories are intrinsically attractive as in many cases they display features of renormalizability and asymptotic freedom . among such approaches ,",
    "lovelock gravity @xcite is especially interesting as the resulting equations of motion contain no more than second derivatives of the metric , include the self interaction of gravitation , and are free of ghosts when expanding around flat space .",
    "the four - derivative gauss - bonnet term is most probably the dominant correction to the einstein - hilbert action @xcite when considering the dimensionally extended euler densities used in the lovelock lagrangian which straightforwardly generalizes the einstein approach in ( 4+n)-dimensions .",
    "the action therefore reads as : @xmath0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a coupling constant of dimension ( length)@xmath2 , and @xmath3 the @xmath4dimensional newton s constant defined as @xmath5 in terms of the fundamental planck scale @xmath6 .",
    "gauss - bonnet gravity was shown to exhibit a very rich phenomenology in cosmology ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite and references therein ) , high - energy physics ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite and references therein ) and black hole theory ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it also provides interesting solutions to the dark energy problem @xcite , offers a promising framework for inflation @xcite , allows useful modification of the randall - sundrum model @xcite and , of course , solves most divergences associated with the endpoint of the hawking evaporation process @xcite .    either in d - dimensions or in 4-dimensions with a dilatonic coupling ( required to make the gauss - bonnet term dynamical ) , gauss - bonnet black holes and their rich thermodynamical properties @xcite have only been studied in the non - spinning ( _ i.e. _ schwarzschild - like ) case .",
    "although some general features can be derived in this framework , it remains mostly unrealistic as both astrophysical black holes and microscopic black holes possibly formed at colliders @xcite are expected to be rotating ( _ i.e. _ kerr - like ) .",
    "of course , the latter  which should be copiously produced at the _ large hadron collider",
    "_ if the planck scale is in the tev range as predicted by some large extra - dimension models @xcite are especially interesting for gauss - bonnet gravity as they could be observed in the high - curvature region of general relativity and allow a direct measurement of the related coupling constant @xcite . the range of impact parameters corresponding to the formation of a non - rotating black hole being of zero measure , the schwarzschild or schwarzschild - gauss - bonnet solutions are mostly irrelevant .",
    "this is also of experimental importance as only a few quanta should be emitted by those light black holes , evading the gibbons @xcite and page @xcite arguments usually pointed out to neglect the angular momentum of primordial black holes .",
    "it should be underlined that d - dimensional spinning black hole solutions are anyway very important within different theoretical frameworks ( _ e.g. _ , in conservation law studies ) @xcite .",
    "thanks to perturbation theory , several attempts were made @xcite to derive the solution . in the following ,",
    "we focus on an analytical approach .",
    "to investigate the detailed properties of black holes in lovelock gravity , it is therefore mandatory to derive the general solution , _",
    "i.e _ the metric for the spinning case . unlike the numerical attempts that were presented in @xcite for degenerated angular momenta ,",
    "the present paper focuses on the exact solution in 5 dimensions .",

    "it is then possible to introduce a new function @xmath17 where @xmath18 so that the equations are equivalent to the following system : @xmath19    introducing the new function @xmath20 via the transformation @xmath21 the second equation can be solved ( with @xmath22 ) , leading to  : @xmath23 where @xmath24 are constants of integration in the @xmath25-th equation .",
    "this equation can be integrated to obtain : @xmath26    the first equation results in @xmath27 where a simple integration by parts @xmath28 leads to : @xmath29    as the same integral combination @xmath30 is involved , the system leads to the quadratic equation : @xmath31 where @xmath32 are new integration constants obtained from a combination of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    taking into account the asymptotes at infinity ( and",
    "therefore finding the values of the integration constants , @xmath35 being the adm mass ) , this leads to @xmath36 where the `` - '' branch should be chosen so as to recover the usual kerr solution in the limit @xmath37 . in case of a vanishing rotation ( @xmath38 )",
    "the obtained solution corresponds to one suggested in ref .",
    "when used in the metric ( [ metric ] ) , this leads to the exact kerr - gauss - bonnet - ( anti ) - desitter solutions of einstein equations . as only the @xmath12 component of the field equations",
    "was used to derive this result , the compatibility with the other components was carefully checked .",
    "although the equations are far too intricate to allow for analytical investigations , numerical results show that they are indeed fulfilled .",
    "to obtain the value of horizon radius @xmath39 it is necessary to transform the metric ( [ metric ] ) back to the boyer - linguist form with : @xmath40 taking into account that the processes relevant for thermodynamical investigations take place in the surroundings of the horizon , @xmath41 can be considered as a small parameter and used for a taylor expansion of @xmath15 as @xmath42 the boyer - linguist parameterization imposes , as a necessary condition , vanishing coefficients for non - diagonal components except for @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this leads to a system of 8 equations with 8 variables .",

    "for the investigation of the black hole topology , one has to study the singular points of the metric component @xmath55 , _",

    "we restrict our study to the @xmath59 case . using the value of @xmath15 given in ( [ betalast ] ) ,",

    "it should be underlined that the angle variable @xmath64 is included in the expression ( [ m ] ) ( as @xmath65 ) , which indicates a good choice of coordinates . to remove this dependence one has to set @xmath66 .",

    "the pure kerr 5d formula , as given in @xcite , leads to : @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "fig.1 displays the pure kerr temperature and the kerr - gauss - bonnet temperature .",
    "as expected , both values become very close for large masses .",
    "they differer by about 5% in the limit of very small masses for @xmath75 in planck units .",

    "if , as suggested by geometrical arguments and by low - energy effective superstring theories , gauss - bonnet gravity is a realistic path toward a full quantum theory of gravity , then kerr - gauss - bonnet black holes are probably among the most important objects to understand the physical basis of our world .",
    "this article has established the solution of einstein equations in the 5-dimensional gauss - bonnet theory .",
    "this allows investigating into the details the physics of `` realistic '' spinning black holes , both from a pure theoretical and from a phenomenological ( in the framework of low planck - scale models ) viewpoint .",
    "some improvements and developments can be foreseen .",
    "first , it should be very welcome to obtain the same kind of solutions for any number of dimensions .",
    "unfortunately the method introduced in this article is not easy to generalize and a specific study should be made for each case .",
    "then , it would be interesting to compute the greybody factors for those black holes . following the techniques of @xcite , it is possible ( although not straightforward ) to obtain a numerical solution as soon as the metric is known , at least in the @xmath59 case .",
    "the kerr - gauss - bonnet-(anti)-desitter situation is more intricate as the metric is nowhere flat , requiring a more detailed investigation , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "after the completion of this work , it was pointed out by n. deruelle that some analytical checks ( _ e.g. _ on the trace of the field equations ) with mathematica suggest that this solution is not exact",
    ". it could mean that the kerr - gauss - bonnet solution should be looked for in a wider class of solutions than kerr - schild ones .",
