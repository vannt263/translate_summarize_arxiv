    "the strong and attractive nature of the @xmath5 interaction in the @xmath6wave @xcite manifests itself in the sharp enhancement of cross sections in @xmath3-producing reactions near threshold @xcite .",

    "have been measured @xcite at the celsius storage ring of the svedberg laboratory , uppsala , using the wasa / promice experimental apparatus for excess energies ( @xmath8 ) @xmath9 14 mev . due to the strong energy dependence of the total cross section close to threshold , the data at low energies are however better suited to study the effect of the final state interaction ( fsi ) and explore the existence of quasi - bound eta - nuclear states . for @xmath10 14 mev ,",
    "two data sets exist for the @xmath0 reaction .",
    "one measurement was performed with the spesiii spectrometer at saturne for two excess energies , namely , @xmath11 1.1 mev and 3.3 mev @xcite .",
    "the other data set was obtained using the cosy-11 detection system at the cosy - jlich accelerator for @xmath11 3.2 mev , 6.1 mev and 9.2 mev @xcite .",
    "these data show enhancements of more than an order of magnitude in comparison to the theoretical plane wave total cross sections , suggesting thereby a strong fsi effect .",
    "at low energies , ignoring the @xmath4 fsi , an averaged squared @xmath13 production amplitude , @xmath14 ( which is the ratio of the cross section for the production of the @xmath13 system to arbitrarily normalized phase space ) is traditionally extracted from data in terms of the scattering length @xmath15 by parametrizing @xcite it as , @xmath16 is considered a ( basically unknown ) scale factor and in principle depends upon the particular reaction studied . at the low energies considered here ,",
    "this factor is practically energy independent .",
    "@xmath17 is the relative momentum of the @xmath13 system . within this parametrization , the analysis of the wasa data ( for @xmath18 14 mev ) , using different values of @xmath15 taken from ref .",
    "20 suggests a preference for @xmath19 fm ( as mentioned in ref .",
    "this value of the @xmath13 scattering length is obtained in ref .",
    "20 using an @xmath5 scattering length of , @xmath20 fm .",
    "conclusions drawn about @xmath15 and subsequent inferences made about the possible existence of quasi - bound @xmath13 states , from such studies , may suffer from limitations and uncertainties because of the reasons listed in the following two subsections .",
    "the scattering length enhancement factor description involves the factorization of the @xmath0 reaction amplitude into the @xmath3 production amplitude and an fsi factor .",
    "this may not be correct .",
    "1 exhibits this .",
    "we plot here @xmath14 using , ( i ) the factorized enhancement factor prescription ( eq .",

    "the @xmath13 fsi is included by numerically solving the lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation ( as described in the next section ) .",
    "the @xmath23-matrix for @xmath3-d elastic scattering , @xmath24 , entering the ls equation is constructed from @xmath15 given in ref .",

    "we plot the squared amplitude obtained from eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in fig .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) respectively , as a function of the excess energy , @xmath25 , in the @xmath13 centre of mass system .",
    "in order to highlight the slopes of these results for different @xmath26 , we choose values for the normalizing constant , @xmath27 , in case of the amplitude obtained from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , such , that the @xmath14 has the same value for the maximum value of @xmath25 ( @xmath28 3.1 mev ) shown in fig .",
    "to do the same for the results obtained from eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we multiply the results by a normalizing constant , @xmath29 .",
    "we observe that , as we approach the threshold , the curves corresponding to the full calculations for different values of @xmath15 ( shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) ) open up much faster than the approximate calculations ( fig .",
    "this means that the value of @xmath15 extracted by fitting the data by using eq .",
    "( 1 ) could be larger than that obtained by using the full calculation .",
    "the @xmath0 reaction , in the final state , in addition to the @xmath13 interaction , involves the @xmath4 interaction , which at low energies becomes important .",
    "there are two possible @xmath6wave @xmath4 final states , the spin - doublet ( @xmath30 ) and the spin - quartet ( @xmath31 ) states .",
    "@xmath30 bears connection to the @xmath4 distribution in the @xmath32 bound state .",
    "furthermore , since both the proton and deuteron are positively charged , at low energies there exists a sizable coulomb repulsion between them too .",
    "the @xmath4 fsi in the present work is included through the multiplication of an inverse jost function @xcite .",
    "this function is known to give the modification of the non - interacting wave function of two particles at short distances due to the interaction between them ( see next section for the jost function expressions or ref .",
    "21 for more details ) . in fig .",
    "2 we show the inverse of the squared jost function , @xmath33^{-2}$ ] for the @xmath6wave @xmath4 interaction . in order to show the effect of the coulomb repulsion , we have plotted the jost function for the doublet and the quadruplet states with and without inclusion of the coulomb part separately .",
    "the contribution of the jost function without coulomb part can be obtained by keeping @xmath34 = 1 in eq .",
    "( [ quad ] ) .",
    "we also show the doublet jost function multiplied by a factor @xmath35 to reflect the fact that the @xmath30 @xmath4 state has a bound state in ( @xmath36he ) with a separation energy @xmath37 of 5.48 mev .",
    "we see that at small values of @xmath38 relative momentum the strong interaction in the @xmath4 system can enhance the wave function and hence the cross section , by a large amount .",
    "the coulomb interaction , being repulsive reduces this effect . however , the overall effect is still an enhancement ( up to a factor of 3 - 6 ) .",
    "the above discussion thus makes it clear that to learn reliably about the @xmath13 interaction near threshold the data on the @xmath0 reaction in this energy range should be analyzed , as far as possible , with the full theoretical framework available and should include all the interactions . in what follows ,",
    "we have made an attempt to explain the new ( preliminary ) data available from ref .",
    "19 by using a formalism @xcite which includes the interaction between all the pairs in the final state .    in the following section we describe the formalism only briefly and",
    "move on to discussing results and conclusions . for more details of the formalism",
    "we refer the reader to our previous articles @xcite .",
    "the cross sections for the @xmath39 reaction close to threshold are evaluated using the two step model for @xmath3 production , where the proton interacts with a proton ( or neutron ) in the deuteron in the first step .",
    "this produces a deuteron and a @xmath40 ( or @xmath41 ) .",
    "the pion in the second step interacts with another nucleon in the original deuteron and produces an @xmath3 .",
    "the two steps thus are @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the @xmath23-matrix for this model in the plane wave approximation is written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the four momentum of the intermediate pion .",
    "the summation is over internal spin projections and the matrix element @xmath46 represents the deuteron wave function in momentum space for which we use the paris parametrization @xcite .    the above kind of model for the production amplitude which involves a two step process ( and hence a three body mechanism for production ) has often been used for meson producing reactions at intermediate and low energies .",
    "the importance of such a model for the @xmath47he @xmath3 reaction was first shown by laget @xcite and then tested with more recent data in ref .",
    "22 and 23 .",
    "it has also been used for other meson producing reactions in ref .",
    "26 and 27 .",
    "though one worries about unitarity bounds on cross sections involving two step processes at high energies ( @xmath48 scattering for example refs .",
    "28 - 30 ) , such worries are not relevant for the present work .",
    "the model calculations done here are very close to threshold and in addition , the cross section for @xmath3 production saturates at high energies .",
    "the pion production in the first step being at high energy , is described by an on - shell @xmath49 @xmath50matrix , which is parametrized using the data on this reaction @xcite .",
    "the @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ pwtm ] ) has been related to the amplitudes @xmath52 given in ref .",
    "31 as @xmath53 and we relate it to the cross section using @xmath54 where @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) is the initial ( final ) momentum in the @xmath57 centre of mass system and @xmath58 is the total energy of the same .",
    "the second step @xmath43 being near threshold , is described by an off - shell @xmath50matrix which is taken from a coupled channel calculation @xcite which reproduces the @xmath43 data well .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "32 for some recent interesting investigations of the @xmath43 data .    to take the fsi into account we include the interactions between the @xmath4 and @xmath13 pairs .",
    "the @xmath59 interaction is implicit in our description of the production vertex , which uses the @xmath50matrix for @xmath43 .",
    "though , in principle , a finer treatment of the three body problem ( involving the 3-body @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 scattering ) would be more appropriate , we expect the present approach to work reasonably well for the problem under consideration .",
    "some remarks in connection with this issue are in order here .",
    "the choice of any approximation is guided by the characteristics of the problem at hand . in our case , because of the large momentum transfer ( @xmath28 770 mev / c ) , the reaction takes place over a small volume of space . in such situations ( first introduced by watson and migdal and subsequently discussed in most of the scattering theory text - books @xcite ) , an essential feature of the cross sections is that the energy dependence of the cross section due to fsi , factors out from that of the primary production amplitude .",
    "the fsi factor , which has the correct high energy behaviour is usually taken to be the inverse of the jost function . in the present paper we have used this prescription for the p - d interaction . having done that , we could include the eta - d interaction fully , hence we did not resort to a similar factorization for it .",
    "we included the eta - d interaction effect fully by keeping it inside the production amplitude and using an exact scattering wave function .",
    "the above factorization method has been used in literature to describe the low momentum behaviour of the meson @xcite and pion spectra @xcite measured in proton - proton collisions , and study the total cross sections in the @xmath60 reaction @xcite .    the transition matrix for the reaction , @xmath61 , which includes the interaction between the @xmath3 meson and the deuteron",
    "is written as , @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the proton momenta in the initial and final states , respectively .",
    "@xmath65 is the @xmath3 momentum in the @xmath13 centre - of - mass . @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the spin projections for the proton and the deuteron in the initial and final states .",
    "the final state @xmath3-d wave function , @xmath68 consists of a plane wave and a scattered wave and satisfies the lippmann schwinger equation for @xmath13 elastic scattering : @xmath69 here , @xmath24 is the @xmath23-matrix for @xmath3-d elastic scattering . replacing the above equation in the transition matrix for the @xmath0 reaction ( eq .",
    "( [ fulltmatrix ] ) ) , leads to @xmath70 where the first term represents the @xmath3 production without any interaction with the deuteron and the second one takes care of the rescattering of the @xmath3-d pair to all orders .",
    "it is indeed the half - off - shell @xmath23-matrix , @xmath71 , which is reponsible for converting the off - shell eta mesons in the intermediate state to the on - shell ones in the final state .    since the low energy @xmath72 interaction is dominated by the @xmath73 resonance n@xmath74(1535 ) ,",
    "we perform a partial wave expansion of the @xmath3-d @xmath23-matrix , @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) and retain only @xmath77-waves .",
    "@xmath78 is half off - shell and we write it as a product of an on - shell @xmath50matrix and an off - shell ( which is actually half off - shell here ) form factor .",
    "thus , we write @xmath78 using @xmath77-waves only as , @xmath79 where the @xmath80 is written in terms of the @xmath81 scattering length as @xmath82 we choose to define the off - shell form factor in terms of the deuteron form factor as in ref .",
    "40 , @xmath83 where an average over the directions of the momenta has been performed in order to extract the @xmath77-wave contribution .",
    "the deuteron wave function , @xmath84 , is written using the paris parametrization @xcite .    the @xmath81 scattering length , used in eq .",
    "( [ ton ] ) , is taken from ref .",
    "20 , where it has been deduced by solving three - body faddeev type equations .",
    "this calculation includes the scattering of the @xmath3 on the break - up continuum states as well as on the deuteron in the intermediate state .",
    "we use the @xmath15 in this work calculated for a wide range of @xmath5 scattering lengths since the @xmath5 interaction is still not very well known .    for the @xmath4 interaction ,",
    "as mentioned above , we use the jost function , which is justified because the @xmath3 production involves high momentum transfer . near threshold",
    "this value is around 700 mev / c .",

    "( ii ) comparison of results with and without coulomb repulsion show that the coulomb interaction reduces the cross section by a large amount .",
    "in fact , it is because of this interaction that the calculated cross sections come in accord with the experiments .",

    "we have also studied the sensitivity of the results to the @xmath5 scattering length which is still not so well known .",

    "the cross sections for the @xmath0 reaction at low energies ( up to @xmath28 20 mev above threshold ) are then evaluated within a two step model for @xmath3 production to investigate the importance of including the fsi between all particles at low energies .",
    "the conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "quantitative reproduction of the experimentally observed enhancement in the cross section near threshold , requires the inclusion of the interaction between all three particles , namely , the proton , deuteron and the eta meson in the final state .",
    "both the strong and coulomb @xmath4 fsi are found to be important at low energies .",
    "2 .    the best agreement with experimental data seems to come from the @xmath3-nucleon scattering length values of @xmath101 fm and @xmath98 fm .",
