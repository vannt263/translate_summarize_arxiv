    "jamming is a ubiquitous phenomenon that disrupts the flow of vehicles on a city road @xcite , molecular motors in a biological cell @xcite , fluids in narrow pipes and food grains through a hopper @xcite .",
    "usually one expects a jam to form at high densities and dissolve at lower densities ; however , a jam can form at low particle densities also @xcite .",
    "for example , on a bus route , if one of the buses gets delayed , the number of passengers waiting for it increases and so does the time interval during which the bus halts . as a result , the bus gets delayed even more leading to a cluster of buses behind it even when few buses are serving on the affected bus route @xcite .",
    "a similar situation occurs on an ant trail when the pheromone that guides the ant movement gets evaporated @xcite .",
    "large headways in front of a jam have been observed in experiments on ant trails @xcite and camphor boats @xcite where the agents ( ants and boats ) form a platoon at low densities due to the presence of an external field , namely , pheromone and camphor concentration respectively .",
    "of course , a traffic jam can also form behind a slow car on a single - lane highway where overtaking is prohibited even when there are few vehicles @xcite .    here",
    "we study the stationary state dynamics of several driven lattice - gas models in one dimension that exhibit a jamming transition in the sense that the gap between the particles is of order unity when the total particle density is high .",
    "however , a long headway forms in front of a particle while other particles get clustered behind it , when the density is lowered . a special case of the models studied here is the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) in which a particle hops to the left neighbor with rate one if it is empty .",
    "it is known that the jamming transition does not occur in this model and its steady state dynamics can be understood using its relationship to the kardar - parisi - zhang equation for interface growth ; specifically , the density - density autocorrelation function decays with time as @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the models of interest here are also driven and the particle interactions are hard core , but the hop rates in these models are such that a jamming transition can occur . moreover , in the fluid phase and at the critical point , the hole clusters are not macroscopically long as in the tasep .",
    "then it is natural to ask if the dynamical properties in the fluid phase and especially at the critical point differ from those in the tasep .",
    "the class of models that we consider here are related to a zero range process whose stationary state is known exactly @xcite or a misanthrope process for which the exact steady state measure can be found in certain cases @xcite . in these models , a jamming transition appears as a condensation transition where a macroscopically large mass cluster forms on a single site at high densities but at low densities , the mass is distributed uniformly .",
    "the coarsening dynamics in the condensate phase have been studied for these models quite extensively @xcite , but the stationary state dynamics are largely unexplored ( however , see @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that in this picture , the questions relate to the properties of hole _ clusters _ , whereas here we are concerned with the holes themselves .",
    "the relation to the zero range process or misanthrope process allows us to find the static density - density correlation function analytically .",
    "recently , we studied the equal time density - density correlation function in the stationary state @xcite , and it was shown that at the critical point , it decays with distance as a power law with a continuously varying exponent . using this result and numerical simulations , we find that at the critical point , the autocorrelation function decays as a power law in time with an exponent that changes continuously with a parameter in the model when the static correlation function decays slower than inverse distance , but the tasep behavior for the autocorrelation function , _ viz .",

    "we will consider the hop rate given by @xcite u(n)=1 +  ,  n > 0  ,   [ hoprate ] where the parameter @xmath10 .",
    "when @xmath11 , we obtain the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) @xcite .",
    "for nonzero @xmath12 , the rate @xmath4 decreases with the increasing number of vacancies and therefore a particle with many holes in front of it hops at a slower rate and can cause a jam behind it .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that for @xmath13 , a phase transition occurs between a homogeneous phase in which the length of the typical hole cluster is of order unity and a jammed phase with a macroscopically large hole cluster , as the total particle density is decreased .    to see this result ,",
    "it is useful to consider a zero range process ( zrp ) in which there is no restriction on the number of particles that a site can support @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_mapping ] , regarding a particle as a site and vacancies as mass clusters , the exclusion process described above with @xmath2 sites and @xmath3 particles maps to a zrp with @xmath14 sites and @xmath15 particles ( each of unit mass ) in which a particle hops out to its right neighbor at a rate that depends on the number of particles at the departure site @xcite .",

    "the generating function @xmath28 is the gauss hypergeometric function which converges for @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "therefore , if a solution for the fugacity @xmath30 exists for all @xmath31 , the stationary state is in the fluid phase since the distribution of the hole cluster length is an exponential , see ( [ pm1 ] ) .",

    "thus for @xmath13 , the system is in a homogeneous phase for @xmath37 , while for @xmath38 , the homogeneous phase at particle density @xmath36 coexists with a macroscopically long hole cluster of length @xmath39 .",
    "the exclusion process described at the beginning of this section can also be related to an interface growth model .",
