    "anderson localization is a well known phenomenon associated with wave interference arising from multiple scattering by defects .",
    "being originally suggested for the suppression of classical diffusive motion of electrons due to disorder introduced into a periodic structure  @xcite , the anderson localization is currently associated with many physical systems of different origin and nature . as a matter of fact , the anderson localization is universal to all wave systems in disordered potentials and media ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite to cite a few ) .",
    "in particular , the anderson localization occurs upon propagation and scattering of light in random media , which are microscopically transparent but appear opaque because of the localization effect  @xcite .",
    "many experimental studies of the localization properties of light include the demonstration of exponential decay of transmittance with the sample length  @xcite and the study of transverse localization in one- and two - dimensional disordered photonic lattices  @xcite .",
    "here we study , both analytically and numerically , the anderson localization of light propagating through random _ magnetoactive _ layered structures .",
    "we demonstrate that an interplay between strong localization and magnetooptical effects produces a number of _ nonreciprocity _ features in the transmission characteristics .",
    "magnetooptical effects and nonreciprocity are widely exploited in modern optics and applied physics  @xcite . in particular",
    ", magnetoactive periodic structures are currently attracting growing attention @xcite .",
    "the main phenomena of interest are the enhanced faraday effect on resonances  @xcite and one - way propagation ( nonreciprocal transmission ) @xcite employed for the concept of optical insulators .",
    "the resonant faraday effect has also been shown in connection with the localization of light in random layered structures  @xcite .",
    "although the destructive role of the faraday effect on the weak localization effect in three - dimensional random scattering media was examined previously  @xcite , there is no analysis of the strong anderson localization in random magnetoactive media .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the transmission properties of one - dimensional random layered structures with magnetooptical materials .",
    "we employ short - wavelength approximation , where the localization is strong , and consider both faraday and voigt geometries . in the faraday geometry ,",
    "magnetooptical correction to the _ localization length _",
    "results to a significant _ broadband nonreciprocity _ and polarization selectivity in the typical , _ exponentially small transmission_. in the voigt geometry , averaging over random phases suppresses the magnetooptical effect , in contrast to the case of periodic structures where it can be quite pronounced  @xcite . at the same time , in both the geometries we reveal the nonreciprocal frequency shifts of narrow _ transmission resonances _ , corresponding to the excited _ localized states _ inside the structure @xcite .",
    "this offers efficient _ unidirectional propagation _ at the given resonant frequency .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce general formalism for the analysis of the wave propagation and localization in random layered structures , and also discuss generic aspects of nonreciprocity .",
    "section  iii is devoted to the explicit calculations of the averaged localization lengths in the faraday and voigt magnetooptical structures .",
    "transmission resonances in these structures are discussed in section  iv . finally , section  v concludes the paper .",
    "we consider transmission of a polarized electromagnetic wave incident on a random stack of the length @xmath0 which consists of @xmath1 dissipationless magnetoactive layers possessing random widths and different optical parameters .",
    "the widths of the layers are independent random values with mean value @xmath2 and variance @xmath3 .",
    "figure  1 displays a scheme of the system with two alternating types of the layers . here",
    "the stack is formed by a sequence of @xmath4 layers of two different types labeled by indices ` @xmath5 ' and ` @xmath6 ' and the whole structure is surrounded by vacuum labeled by index ` @xmath7 ' .",
    "the @xmath8-axis is directed across the layers .    in the simplest case of one type of propagating waves , the waves at each point",
    "can be described by two amplitudes @xmath9 corresponding to the propagation in positive @xmath10 and negative @xmath11 directions with respect to @xmath8-axis .",
    "transmission of these waves through the structure is described by the total transfer matrix @xmath12 , which expresses the input amplitudes via their output value : @xmath13 the amplitudes are assumed to be normalized so that the intensity @xmath14 gives the wave energy .",
    "then the transfer matrix is unimodular , @xmath15 , which ensures the energy flux conservation .",
    "the transmission coefficient @xmath16 for the wave @xmath17 incident on the system from the left is simply related to the first diagonal element of the transfer matrix : @xmath18 the corresponding transmittance of the structure is @xmath19    ( color online . )",
    "schematic picture of the wave transmission and reflection from a random - layered structure consisting of two types of alternating layers ` @xmath5 ' ( here  a magnetoactive material ) and ` @xmath6 ' ( here  air ) with random widths .",
    "magnetization of the medium , wave polarizations and directions of propagation are shown for the faraday and voigt geometries . ]",
    "due to anderson localization , the absolute value of the transmission coefficient exponentially decreases with the stack length for a typical random realization .",
    "such a decrease is described by the dimensionless transmission decrement @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 stands for the ensemble averaging . in the case of @xmath22",
    ", it coincides with the inverse dimensionless localization length @xmath23 : @xmath24 the real dimensional localization length is obtained by multiplication of @xmath23 by the averaged length of one period , @xmath25 .",
    "we are interested in two transmission characteristics : transmittance on a realization , @xmath26 , eq . ( [ total - transm ] ) , and transmission decrement @xmath27 , eq .",
    "( [ transm decrement ] ) . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we represent our system as a sequence of uniform layers of media ` @xmath5 ' or ` @xmath6 ' and interfaces between them ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stack ] ) .",
    "wave propagation inside the layers is described by diagonal transfer matrices : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the phase accumulated upon the wave propagating from left to right through the @xmath30-th layer . here",
    "the layers with odd numbers @xmath31 are filled with medium ` @xmath5 ' , whereas those with even numbers @xmath32 are filled with the medium ` @xmath6 ' .",
    "the interfaces are described by unimodular transfer matrices @xmath33 corresponding , respectively , to transitions from vacuum to the medium ` @xmath5 ' , from the medium ` @xmath5 ' to the medium ` @xmath6 ' , from the medium ` @xmath6 ' to the medium ` @xmath5 ' , and from the medium ` @xmath5 ' to vacuum .",
    "thus , the total transfer matrix ( [ total trans matr ] ) of the structure is @xmath34 here , in the two last multipliers , we used the group property of the interface transfer matrices : @xmath35 .",
    "our numeric calculations of transmittance ( [ total - transm ] ) and transmission decrement ( [ transm decrement ] ) are based on the exact expression ( [ total transf matr ] ) . at the same time , analytical expression for the transmission decrement can be readily obtained in the short - wavelength approximations .",
    "first , in the localized regime , the main contribution to the localization length is provided by @xmath36 transfer matrices of the layers and we can neglect the external interface transfer matrices @xmath37 , @xmath38 just replacing the exact matrix @xmath39 by the truncated matrix @xmath40 : @xmath41 second , if the wavelength within the @xmath30-th layer is much shorter than the variance of the layer thikness @xcite : @xmath42 then the phases @xmath29 modulo @xmath43 in the propagation matrices ( [ space ] ) are nearly uniformly distributed in the range @xmath44 . in this approximation ,",
    "the transmittance for the transfer matrix ( [ truncated ] ) averaged over the phases @xmath29 is reduced to the product of the transmittances of separate layers @xcite and , furthermore , to the product of transmittances of the interfaces only @xcite : @xmath45 substitution of eq .",
    "( [ factorization ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ loclength ] ) yields the following simple expression for the transmission decrement and corresponding localization length : @xmath46 this is the main result for calculation of the localization length in the short - wavelength approximation .",
    "it can be easily extended to any number of alternating layers .",
    "for instance , considering a random structure consisting of three types of alternating layers , ` @xmath5 ' , ` @xmath6 ' , and ` @xmath47 ' , with @xmath48 , one has @xmath49      transmission through a one - dimensional dissipationless linear medium is always reciprocal if there is only one ( but propagating in two directions ) mode in the system . indeed , while the forward transmission of the @xmath17 wave incident from the left on the medium is described by the @xmath50 transfer matrix @xmath12 , the backward transmission of the reciprocal @xmath51 wave incident from the right is characterized by the inverse transfer matrix @xmath52 . using the @xmath53 group properties of the transfer matrix",
    ", one can easily show that the corresponding transmission coeffisient ( [ total - transm - coeff ] ) of the backward wave is @xmath16 , i.e. , exactly coincides with that of the forward wave @xcite .",
    "if the system possesses two or more uncoupled modes labeled by index @xmath54 , the situation can be more complicated . in this case , the waves are marked by the propagation direction and mode indices : @xmath55 .",
    "still , the forward and backward propagation of each mode @xmath54 through the system ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 incident waves ) are described by the @xmath50 transfer matrices @xmath58 and @xmath59 characterized by the same transmittance @xmath60 .",
    "however , the wave reciprocal to @xmath56 is determined by the _ time - reversal operation _ which changes @xmath61 ( because of the @xmath62 transformation ) but can also affect @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "in particular , if the time reversal operation changes the sign of the mode index : @xmath63 , then the _ reciprocal _ wave will be @xmath64 rather than the _ backward _ wave of the same mode , @xmath57 .",
    "accordingly , the transmittances of the mutually reciprocal waves through the system , @xmath60 and @xmath65 , can be different .",
    "this signals _ nonreciprocity _ in the system .",
    "note that noreciprocity in the system under consideration originates from the difference between the modes @xmath54 and @xmath66 , and does not depend explicitly on the direction of incidence @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , in practice , it is sufficient to compare only _ forward _ transmissions of the modes @xmath68 , described by the transfer matrices @xmath69 and transmittances @xmath70 .",
    "as we show below , propagation of light in magnetoactive layered media offers nonreciprocal transmission which can be explained within the above formalism .",
    "there are two main geometries typical for magneto - optical problems @xcite : ( i ) the faraday geometry , where the magnetization is collinear with the direction of propagation of the wave , and ( ii ) the voigt ( or cotton - mouton ) geometry , where the magnetization is orthogonal to the direction of propagation of the wave ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "in the next sections we study the averaged transmission decrement ( sec .",
    "iii ) and individual transmission resonances ( sec .",
    "iv ) in both geometries .",
    "in the faraday geometry both magnetization and the wave vector are directed across the layers , i.e. , along the @xmath8-axis ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we assume that the magneto - optical effects are described exclusively by the dielectric tensor , while the magnetic tensor is equal to one . in this case",

    "we assume that @xmath75 and will be interested in the effects linear in @xmath76 .",

    "<S> we study , both analytically and numerically , disorder - induced localization of light in random layered structures with magnetooptical materials . </S>",
    "<S> the anderson localization in such structures demonstrates nonreciprocal features in the averaged localization length and individual transmission resonances . </S>",
    "<S> we employ short - wavelength approximation where the localization effects are strong , and consider both the faraday and voigt magnetooptical geometries . in the faraday geometry , </S>",
    "<S> the transmission is strongly nonreciprocal for the circularly polarized waves , whereas in the voigt geometry , the nonreciprocity is much weaker , and it may appear only for the individual transmission resonances of the tm - polarized waves . </S>"
