    "elastic strain is widely used today to improve the properties of electronic materials .",
    "for example , the effect of the strain - induced decrease of the acceptor binding energy in germanium enabled to create unique photodetectors working in the far infrared .",
    "@xcite an increase of the electron mobility in strained silicon enabled to considerably improve the performance of silicon field - effect transistors ,  @xcite and the use of highly strained layers in pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistors made it possible to deliberately tune the energy diagrams of these heterostructures in order to significantly improve their characteristics .",
    "@xcite    the appearance of a strain - induced ferroelectricity in different dielectrics significantly extends the functionality of these materials and enables to offer new , previously known designs of electronic devices .",
    "the strain of incipient ferroelectrics leads to particularly impressive results .",
    "@xcite for example , the stretching of thin films of strontium titanate srtio@xmath0 grown on dysco@xmath0 substrates increases the curie temperature in this material , which is nonpolar in the absence of strain , to @xmath2300  k ,  @xcite and the compression of these films grown on silicon substrates increases this temperature up to @xmath2410  k ( ref .  ) .",
    "strontium titanate is an incipient ferroelectric exhibiting a competition between the ferroelectric and antiferrodistortive ( octahedral rotational ) instabilities .",
    "@xcite the latter of them is the cause of the phase transition observed in srtio@xmath0 at about 105  k. the first work in which the influence of strain on the ferroelectric properties of strontium titanate was considered within the phenomenological approach was the work of uwe and sakudo .",
    "@xcite pertsev _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have developed this approach to describe the effect of the epitaxial strain on srtio@xmath0 thin films . by expanding the thermodynamic potential in a power series of two order parameters ( polarization and octahedral rotation ) to the fourth order",
    ", the authors obtained a rich pressure  temperature phase diagram with a large number of different phases .",
    "for the set of material constants of srtio@xmath0 used by the authors , all obtained solutions had the order parameters directed along the axes of the cubic structure .",
    "subsequent first - principles calculations in which the antiferrodistortive instability was neglected ,  @xcite however , have shown that in stretched srtio@xmath0 films the polarization should be directed along the [ 110 ] axis , in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "@xcite a more thorough first - principles study of the low - temperature phases of srtio@xmath0 , in which both ferroelectric and antiferrodistortive instabilities were taken into account ,  @xcite showed that in highly stretched srtio@xmath0 films the polarization is indeed directed along the [ 110 ] axis , but at low strain a phase with the [ 100 ] polarization appears .",
    "this orientation of the polarization was observed later in anisotropically strained srtio@xmath0 films grown on gdsco@xmath0 and dysco@xmath0 substrates .",
    "@xcite the phase diagrams of strained srtio@xmath0 for other sets of material constants were studied within the phenomenological and the phase - field approaches in refs .  .",
    "when studying the strain effects on the properties of different materials , the fixed - strain boundary conditions are usually used . however",
    ", the study of the fixed - stress boundary conditions is also important for real systems . to explain this ,",
    "let s consider a thin epitaxial film which has domain structure and is fixed on a substrate . if the substrate is incompressible , then the in - plane lattice parameters in these domains would be equal to the lattice parameter of the substrate .",
    "however , in real systems the lattice parameters in the domains will be different because the substrate is compressible , and the difference between them will increase with increasing film thickness . in the limit of highly compressible ( flexible ) substrate ,",
    "if one neglects mechanical and electrical boundary conditions at the domain walls , we come to the fixed - stress boundary conditions . in practice",
    ", the fixed - strain boundary conditions can be realized in ultrathin epitaxial films , whereas the fixed biaxial stress boundary conditions can be realized in films grown on flexible substrates or thin plates which are fixed at their edges on a set of piezoelectric actuators .",
    "the actual boundary conditions in real systems are intermediate between the two limiting cases , and this is why the analysis of both cases is necessary when studying the strain effects .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the ferroelectric and antiferrodistortive instabilities in srtio@xmath0 under the fixed - stress boundary conditions and compare them with the results obtained for the fixed - strain boundary conditions .",
    "two different ways of applying stress to the film are examined : a uniaxial stress normal to the film plane and a biaxial stress in the film plane .",
    "we show that these two ways of applying stress result in different phase diagrams .",
    "we demonstrate that the simultaneous presence of competing ferroelectric and antiferrodistortive instabilities in srtio@xmath0 gives rise to the appearance of previously unknown metastable phases , whose number increases dramatically under the fixed - stress conditions , and explain the origin of the metastability .",
    "elastic deformation of srtio@xmath0 films was realized in two ways . to create the fixed - strain boundary conditions ,",
    "the ( 001)-oriented film was grown on a cubic substrate with the lattice parameter @xmath3 , which was varied within @xmath42% of the lattice parameter of cubic strontium titanate . to create the fixed - stress boundary conditions ,",
    "the stress was applied along the @xmath5  axis normal to the film plane ( the pressure is @xmath6}$ ] ) or in the @xmath7 plane ( the pressure is @xmath8}$ ] ) .",
    "the film was considered free to relax in directions normal to the applied stress or strain .",
    "calculations of the equilibrium lattice parameters and atomic positions in films were performed within the first - principles density functional theory using the ` abinit ` software .",
    "the exchange - correlation interaction was described in the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "the pseudopotentials of atoms constructed using the rkkj scheme  @xcite were borrowed from ref .  .",
    "the plane - wave cutoff energy was 30  ha ( 816  ev ) , the accuracy of self - consistent energy calculations was better than @xmath9  ha . for the integration over the brillouin zone , a 8@xmath108@xmath108 monkhorst - pack mesh for the cubic cell or meshes with equivalent density of @xmath11-points for low - symmetry phases were used .",
    "the relaxation of atomic positions and lattice parameters was performed until the forces acting on the atoms become less than @xmath12  ha / bohr ( 0.1  mev /  ) . near the boundaries between the phases , the accuracy of the relaxation was increased to @xmath13  ha / bohr .    as the energy difference between some phases in this work can be as small as 0.1  mev ,",
    "the accuracy and convergence of calculations are very important issues .",
    "insufficient @xmath11-point density , parallel shift of all atoms in the unit cell , and different sets of @xmath11-points for different structures are the main sources of errors .",
    "the convergence studies have shown that an increase of the @xmath11-point density by a factor of three changes the energies of phases by no more than 0.02  mev .",
    "more important errors may result from a parallel shift of all atoms in the unit cell .",
    "the standard deviation of the energy of phases calculated for 20  different random parallel shifts was equal to 0.028  mev and was independent of the @xmath11-point density .",
    "as to the third source of errors , in most calculations we used the same sets of the @xmath11-points when performing the integration over the brillouin zone , but the tests have shown that the changes in the energy of phases calculated for different sets of @xmath11-points do not exceed 0.03  mev .",
    "the errors in the enthalpy calculations resulting from variations of the unit cell volume and local stresses were less than 0.003  mev .",
    "so , the accuracy of our calculations enables to reliably distinguish the energy difference of 0.1  mev .    in searching for the ground state , after the relaxation of a structure of each relevant phase for each value of applied stress or strain , the phonon spectrum and the elastic tensor were calculated and it was checked whether all optical phonon frequencies at all high - symmetry points of the brillouin zone are positive and whether the determinant and all leading principal minors constructed from components of the elastic tensor are positive ( the stability criterion ) .",
    "if the criterion is not satisfied , small distortions corresponding to the least stable phonon were added to the structure , and the search for the ground state was continued .",
    "the technique of phonon spectra and elastic tensor calculations was similar to that described in ref .  .",
    "we considered only monodomain states because domain walls usually have a positive energy and so the multidomain solutions have a higher energy .",
    "the phonon spectrum calculations for the high - temperature @xmath14 phase of srtio@xmath0 confirmed a well - known result that there are three types of instabilities in the phonon spectrum : the ferroelectric one associated with the @xmath15 mode at the center of the brillouin zone and two antiferrodistortive instabilities with respect to rotations of the oxygen octahedra described by @xmath16 and @xmath17 modes at the boundary of the brillouin zone .",
    "@xcite since the @xmath17 instability is weak and disappears when the mode at the @xmath18  point is condensed , we will neglect it when searching for the ground state .",
    "the calculations showed that in the absence of strain , the ground - state structure of strontium titanate is the @xmath19 phase .",
    "@xcite       film grown on a cubic substrate with the lattice parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the energy of high - symmetry @xmath20 phase is taken as the energy reference .",
    "the vertical line indicates the lattice parameter of cubic srtio@xmath0 .",
    "short arrows show the lattice parameters at which the frequencies of soft optical modes vanish . ]    to better understand the influence of the fixed - stress boundary conditions on the phase diagrams , we first consider the phase diagrams for srtio@xmath0 films grown on a cubic substrate ( the fixed - strain boundary conditions ) .",
    "our calculations ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) show that the sequence of the ground states [ @xmath21(ii)@xmath22(ii ) ] in this case is unexpectedly complex .",
    "the transition between the @xmath23 and @xmath19 phases occurs at @xmath24  bohr and is not shown in the figure ( see table  a1 in the appendix ) . at @xmath25  bohr",
    ", the @xmath19 phase becomes unstable and transforms to the @xmath26 phase , in which the octahedra are rotated around the [ 001 ] pseudocubic axis , whereas the polarization is along the [ 110 ] one ( table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "for all strains , this phase has a lower energy as compared to the @xmath27 phase in which the rotations are around the same axis , but the polarization is along the [ 100 ] axis .",
    "the transition between the @xmath26 and @xmath28 phases occurs at @xmath29  bohr and is a first - order transition ( the molar volumes of the two phases differ by 0.75% at the transition point ) .",
    "near the phase transition point , the @xmath28 phase can be regarded as a slightly distorted @xmath26(ii ) phase,(ii ) and @xmath27(ii ) phases at @xmath307.357.37  bohr . for example , in the @xmath26(ii ) phase , the eigenvector of unstable @xmath31 phonon at the @xmath32  point at @xmath307.367.37  bohr includes , in addition to polar displacements , the octahedral rotations around the @xmath33  axis perpendicular to the polarization , whereas at @xmath34  bohr , the unstable phonon is at the boundary of the brillouin zone and describes the _ in - phase _ octahedral rotations around the @xmath5 axis ( similar to those described by the @xmath17 phonon in the cubic phase ) .",
    "the frequencies of these phonons are @xmath210@xmath35 @xmath36 . ] but the polarization vector quickly rotates in the plane from the [ 110 ] to [ 100 ] direction with increasing @xmath3 , and already at @xmath37  bohr the @xmath27(ii ) phase becomes the ground state . at @xmath307.397.40  bohr , the energy of the @xmath27(ii ) phase turns out to be slightly lower than that of the @xmath26(ii ) phase ( by approximately 0.1  mev , see table  a1 in the appendix for the energies of the phases ) .",
    "it is interesting that both phases with the lowest energy [ @xmath27(ii ) and @xmath26(ii ) ] in this region satisfy the stability criterion ( i.e. , the former of them is stable and the latter is metastable ) , so that in this region the phases with polarizations along the [ 110 ] and [ 100 ] pseudocubic axes can coexist .",
    "this , in particular , enables to explain why two different orientations of polarization have been observed in two different experiments  @xcite on srtio@xmath0 films grown on dysco@xmath0 substrates and to understand the sensitivity of polarization to the anisotropic strain of the substrate . at @xmath38  bohr ,",
    "the @xmath26(ii ) phase becomes the ground state .",
    ".[table1]space groups and order parameters for phases considered in this work .",
    "the first three symbols in the order parameter denote cartesian coordinates of the polarization vector and the last three symbols denote the rotations around the pseudocubic axes .",
    "the lattice parameters and atomic positions for typical representatives of the structures can be found in tables  a3 to a12 in the appendix . [",
