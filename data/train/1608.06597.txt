    "since the confirmation of the oscillation of neutrinos in 1998 by the super - kamiokande collaboration  @xcite , a considerable amount of analysis has been made concerning the measurement of the parameters involved in the oscillation  @xcite . in the standard three families oscillation scheme ,",
    "four parameters appear in the mixing matrix : three mixing angles and a cp violation phase . the former have been measured with great accuracy ; however , the later had not been properly constrained .",
    "several parameterizations for the leptonic mixing matrix exist in the literature  @xcite .",
    "they are suited for different purposes ; for example , to investigate the nature of the neutrino ( dirac or majorana ) , or to probe extra neutrino states in oscillation experiments  @xcite .",
    "most of the analyses have been done with the particle data group parametrization  @xcite , but if we are looking to perform a unitary test  @xcite , it is desirable to use a formulation as independent of the parametrization as possible .",
    "moreover , to obtain precise results , it is necessary to take into account the matter effects on the oscillation  @xcite .",
    "the next generation of experiments is looking to use this effect in future analysis .",
    "therefore , the analysis gets more complicated , requesting the use of computational solutions or approximated expressions @xcite .",
    "+ in the first section of this work we give exact expressions for the oscillation probability @xmath1 in a constant density medium , which are formulated without a particular parametrization ; these will come in handy for future unitary tests .",
    "additionally , in the second section we introduce new approximated and simple expressions , which can be defined to a desired degree of accuracy due to their series expansion nature .",
    "finally , we compare this approximation with the most currently used and other two found in the literature .",
    "it is important to notice that this work is based on  @xcite .",
    "the evolution equation for a neutrino @xmath2 with definite mass is given by @xmath3 these mass states are related to the flavor states @xmath4 through the leptonic mixing matrix , @xmath5 , via @xmath6 , where a sum over @xmath7 is understood .",
    "the mixing matrix can be parametrized depending on the context of the study . from ( [ 1.1 ] ) one can calculate the known vacuum oscillation probability , from @xmath4 to @xmath8 .",
    "if extra heavy neutrinos exist , they can not participate in the oscillation because the energy will not be sufficient , but the unitarity of @xmath5 will be clearly affected .",
    "the @xmath9 mixing matrix responsible of the oscillation is now just a block of the whole @xmath10 matrix @xmath5 .",
    "this effect changes the usual @xmath9 expression into @xmath11 \\sin^2\\left ( \\frac{\\delta m^2_{\\ell j}l}{4e}\\right ) & \\nonumber \\\\   + 2\\displaystyle\\sum^{3}_{\\ell > j } { \\operatorname{im}}\\left [ u_{\\alpha \\ell}^{*}u_{\\beta \\ell}u_{\\alpha j}u_{\\beta j}^ { * } \\right ] \\sin \\left ( \\frac{\\delta m^2_{\\ell j}l}{2e}\\right)\\,.&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    notice that now there is zero distance effect due to the non - unitary mixing matrix . additionally , if matter effects are to be considered , we need to add the charge - current potential @xmath12 to the evolution equation in ( [ 1.1 ] ) in the form of @xmath13 : @xmath14    as usual , if we consider unitarity in @xmath5 , the expression for the probability in matter holds the same functional form as in vacuum ; with the replacement of @xmath15 by the effective mass difference , @xmath16 , and the replacement of @xmath5 by the effective mixing , v , that is related to the vacuum expression through @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the unitary matrix diagonalizing the hamiltonian in the right - hand side of equation ( [ 1.4 ] ) .",
    "one of the purposes of this work is to express the matter probability as a function entirely of the vacuum parameters and the potential .",
    "therefore our problem reduces to find the matrix @xmath18 .",
    "this can be done following the procedure of @xcite but with the difference that we are leaving explicitly the elements @xmath19 , in other words , without a specific parametrization .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath20 has the characteristic polynomial form    @xmath21    with @xmath22 \\nonumber .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here we have left indicated on purpose the expressions involving the condition of @xmath5 been unitary , to show how these expressions can be easily changed in the case of a non - unitary study .",
    "now we can write the squared effective masses in terms of the previous coefficients @xmath23    the columns that constitute the diagonalizing matrix @xmath18 correspond to the eigenvectors of @xmath24 .",
    "a suitable choice of them gives us @xmath25 \\right)}{c_k}\\,,\\ ] ]    where we have defined @xmath26 , \\quad \\mbox{for } \\quad k\\neq i , \\ ] ] and a normalization constant , @xmath27 , as @xmath28    with the help of the relation  ( [ 1.6 ] ) we are able to write down a compact expression , relating the entries of the effective matter mixing matrix @xmath29 : @xmath30 \\right)}{c_k}.\\ ] ]    it is easy to note that this expression reduces to the vacuum case when @xmath31 .",
    "this relation is useful in the description of neutrino matter oscillation probabilities as a function of the vacuum parameters , without a particular choice of parametrization for the leptonic mixing matrix .",
    "the unitarity of @xmath5 is not assumed .",
    "that makes it useful in case a unitary test would be implemented .",
    "now that we have presented the exact formula for the neutrino oscillation probability , free of any parametrization , we will start with the process of deducing an approximated formula .",
    "although there exist several approximations in the literature , our expression will stick to the purpose of a formulation without parametrization . to accomplish this",
    ", we are looking to approximate the effective masses appearing in ( [ 1.12 ] ) .",
    "+ first , we notice that @xmath32 implies @xmath33 , and the polynomial in ( [ 1.9 ] ) reduces to a quadratic form .",
    "if this is the case , we have : @xmath34 \\,,\\ ] ] which reduces to @xmath35 now we go to the real case : it is well known that @xmath36 , therefore , @xmath37 is different from zero and @xmath38 .",
    "we suggest a correction @xmath39 that needs to fulfill @xmath40 and @xmath41 working up to first - order terms in @xmath42 is easy to find that @xmath43 fulfills both conditions ( [ 1.20 ] ) and ( [ 1.21 ] ) .",
    "the eigenvalues in ( [ 1.12 ] ) are then approximated to @xmath44 } ,   \\\\",
    "m_3 ^ 2 \\equiv \\lambda_2 & \\simeq &             \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\alpha-\\frac{2}{3}\\varepsilon\\right )          + \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\left(\\alpha+\\frac{2}{3}\\varepsilon\\right)^2          -4\\left[\\beta+\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\varepsilon\\right)^2\\right ] } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we substitute these back in the polynomial in ( [ 1.9 ] ) , it takes the form : @xmath45 we want to go beyond this and find an expression for @xmath39 at second order in @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , we propose @xmath46 substituting this in  ( [ 1.24 ] ) , and demanding that returns to the form in ( [ 1.9 ] ) up to second - order terms , throws the result @xmath47 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath48 we can go further with this method and find the coefficients @xmath49 in a recursive way .",
    "this states that we can write the correction @xmath39 as an infinite series in powers of @xmath50 and , in principle , obtain the exact case again .",
    "the correction then takes the form @xmath51^k\\ ] ] with @xmath52    now that we have defined the approximation , we would like to test its accuracy by comparing it against the exact formula and also to other known approximations : by akhmedov @xcite and minakata & parke @xcite . to do so",
    ", we first assume unitarity in the mixing matrix and adopt the standard parametrization .",
    "the central values for the mixing parameters are the reported ones in @xcite ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) along with the squared mass differences ( @xmath56  ev@xmath57 , @xmath58  ev@xmath57 ) .",
    "we have taken @xmath59 as the value of the cp phase .",
    "we computed the oscillation probabilities @xmath60 and @xmath61 as function of the baseline at an energy of @xmath62  gev . in fig .",
    "( [ alldifferabs ] ) we compare our result with two other approximations from @xcite ; we can see that our result is competitive with the others , in particular for a small distance ( short - baseline experiments ) .",
    "the precision between different orders of our approximation is shown in fig .",
