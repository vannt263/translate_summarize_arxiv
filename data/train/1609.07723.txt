    "in the wiretap scheme two legitimate communication parties , alice and bob , exchange information in the presence of an _ eavesdropper _ , eve . in this setting , the communication parties rely on physical layer security rather than cryptographic protocols .",
    "hence , eve is assumed to have no computational limitations and know the cryptographic key , if any , but to have a worse signal quality than bob .",
    "the objective of code design in a wiretap channel is to maximize the data rate and bob s correct decoding probability while minimizing eve s information and , in wireless channels , satisfying a power condition .",
    "it was shown in the seminal paper of wyner @xcite that the legitimate parties can design codes with asymptotically non - zero rate , zero error probability and zero information leakage .",
    "today , this setup is particularly interesting in wireless channels that are open in nature and vulnerable to distortions .    as a practical construction of a wiretap code",
    ", @xcite introduced the general technique of _ coset coding _",
    ", where random bits are added to the message to confuse the eavesdropper . in the specific case of a wireless channel , lattice codes",
    "are commonly used , and the code lattice @xmath0 is endowed with a sublattice @xmath1 which carries the random bits @xcite .    the objective of this paper is to study the design criteria for @xmath2 so as to maximize the security of a lattice wiretap code .",
    "we will tacitly assume throughout that @xmath2 is a sublattice of a reliable code lattice @xmath0 with a suitable codebook size given by the nesting index @xmath3 $ ] , and only consider the secrecy problem .      the security of lattice coset codes can be quantized either by eve s correct decision probability , or alternatively by the mutual information of the message and eve s received signal .",
    "for the _ additive white gaussian noise _ ( awgn ) channel , upper bounds are known for both approaches @xcite .",
    "more importantly , both are increasing functions of the _ flatness factor _ of the lattice @xmath2 , yielding its minimization as a design criterion . sequences of lattice coset codes achieving security and reliability are also constructed in @xcite . for different fading channel models ,",
    "various alternative design criteria based on probability and information bounds were derived in @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .",
    "codes achieving security and reliability in the _ multiple - input multiple - output _ ( mimo ) channel , and an information bound , were given in @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , practical low - dimensional code constructions are an open problem in the fading _ single - input single - output _",
    "( siso ) channel .    in this paper , we first motivate a choice of a natural and simple analytic design criterion in this and follow - up work .",
    "we take a very general channel model with linear fading and gaussian noise .",
    "we recall the strategy used to derive probability bounds for rayleigh fading siso and mimo channels in @xcite , and give a new variant of the information bounds derived in @xcite .",
    "we also derive an information bound in the so - called mod @xmath4 channel , to the best our knowledge not considered before in the fading case .",
    "in particular , the way we compute these probability and information bounds allows us to obtain all the bounds explicitly as increasing functions of the _ average flatness factor _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , the expected flatness factor of the faded lattice related to the eavesdropper .",
    "this is a relatively simple design criterion and a natural generalization of the awgn case .",
    "it reduces to the probability bounds of @xcite in rayleigh fading channels .",
    "the equivalence of probability and information bounds as presented here hopefully clarifies the situation where several alternative design criteria for each different channel model have been derived , with occasionally rather complicated analytic expressions .",
    "having motivated the analytical design criterion , we then move on to study the practical finite - dimensional lattice design .",
    "we specialize to the awgn and rayleigh fast fading channels and motivate geometric heuristics to minimize the ( average ) flatness factor .",
    "we conclude that in the gaussian channel , analogously to reliability , the security can be geometrized by the sphere - packing density of the eavesdropper s lattice , whereas in the rayleigh fading channel we suggest taking a full - diversity well - rounded lattice with a dense sphere packing .",
    "these criteria are verified with numerical computations .",
    "the heuristic nature of our criteria of course can not allow for pointing at an exact minimizer of the average flatness factor , but the criteria seem to guarantee a good secrecy and , most importantly , they are simple enough to be satisfied simultaneously with the other wiretap objectives .      we discuss number - theoretic and algorithmic ways to construct _ well - rounded lattices _ that satisfy the geometric criteria derived in this paper in the conference paper @xcite .",
    "also channel simulations are provided in @xcite , showing the good performance of the well - rounded lattices and the geometric design suggested in this paper .",
    "the information bounds derived in this paper were published in a conference paper @xcite , giving a slightly simplified version . there",
    "we also study the numerical computation of the average flatness factor .",
    "we compute the average flatness factors of the lattices simulated in @xcite , finding an agreement of the numerical computations and the channel simulations .",
    "hence , based on subsequent work , the analytical design criteria suggested in this paper indeed seem to _ compare _ and not just _ bound _ the secrecy of different lattices . in the conference paper @xcite",
    ", we study analogous geometric heuristics to minimize the average flatness factor in the mimo channel , for which purpose the general form of the information - theoretic computations here is needed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in secion",
    "[ sec : preli ] , we give the mathematical preliminaries . section [ sec : system ]",
    "introduces the channel models , lattice coset codes , and the detailed setups for probability and information bounds . in section [ sec : bounds ] , we give the eavesdropper s information and probability bounds , yielding the analytical design criterion of average flatness factor .",
    "section [ sec : geometric heuristics ] is devoted to geometrizing this analytical criterion , and the geometric design criteria are verified by extensive numerical computations in section [ sec : numerics ] .",

    "we consider a wireless fading channel with noise .",
    "perfect channel state information is assumed at both receivers ( csir ) , bob and eve ; the transmitter is only assumed to know the channel statistics .",
    "as we are only interested in the eavesdropper s performance , we henceforth only consider the channel between alice and eve , and consequently forgo subscripts in the related quantities . throughout this paper , random variables",
    "are denoted by capital letters and their realizations with lower - case letters .",
    "denote alice s transmitted vector by @xmath92 , so that the channel equation is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the realization of the fading , and the noise vector @xmath95 is composed of i.i.d .",

    "we assume that @xmath97 has full rank almost surely , but need not be a square matrix . the random variables",

    "a complex fading channel model is often considered , together with complex lattice codes . however , separating the real and imaginary parts , a complex channel equation of complex dimension @xmath28 can be reduced to a real channel equation with real dimension @xmath100 .",
    "the class of @xmath101-dimensional real lattices is wider than that of @xmath28-dimensional complex lattices ( identified with their @xmath101-dimensional real couterparts ) , most importantly including `` complex @xmath102 $ ] -lattices '' .",
    "thus , the real model actually allows us to slightly generalize some earlier results given for complex channel models .",
    "a complex model would be more beneficial for explicit computations , but the average theta functions , to which both probability and information bounds reduce , are already computed in @xcite .    in related theoretical work , the most important special cases of the above channel model are the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel , the rayleigh fast fading siso channel , the rayleigh block fading siso channel , and the quasi - static rayleigh fading mimo channel .",
    "our model however also covers , _",
    "e.g. _ , the slow fading channel studied in a practical usrp implementation of coset codes @xcite . in the numerical part of this work we consider the awgn channel where @xmath103 always , and the rayleigh fast fading channel where the fading matrix is diagonal , @xmath104 .",

    "we will henceforth denote the faded lattices @xmath0 and @xmath2 by @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively .",
    "we repeatedly generalize results from the gaussian channel to fading channels by then taking the expectation over all channels states @xmath114 .",
    "coset coding is a general coding strategy for discrete channels , first proposed by l. h. ozarow and a. d. wyner in @xcite . a lattice variant of coset coding is thoroughly presented in @xcite .",
    "the general idea is that alice takes nested lattices @xmath115 . for a ( random ) message @xmath14 from a message set @xmath6 , where @xmath116 $ ] , she has a fixed injective map @xmath117 to pick a unique representative @xmath118 of the coset of @xmath119 corresponding to @xmath14 .",
    "the rate is hence @xmath120 bits per real channel use .",
    "then , alice chooses randomly ( according to some distribution ) a representative of the coset class @xmath121 the rate can be divided into parts relating to the message and random bits , @xmath122 near - complete secrecy is then achieved even if eve receives information with a nonzero rate , approximately equal to @xmath123 .",
    "conceptually , as @xmath118 lies in @xmath124 , it has a `` smaller resolution '' than the lattice @xmath2 , and eve will lose the relevant information at a `` detecting resolution '' approximately good enough to decode @xmath2 .",
    "when deriving eavesdropper s probability or information estimates for lattice coset coding , the boundary effects of the transmission region cause problems .",
    "these problems are not technical but intrinsic since the probability and information essentially depend on how the boundary is shaped .",
    "we consider three different estimates , arising by neglecting the boundary , removing it by a modulo operation of a shaping lattice @xmath4 , and smoothing the boundary , respectively .",
    "the estimates are for    * * setup 1 : * the eavesdropper s correct decoding probability ( ecdp ) , assuming that she , in the awgn resp . fading channel , decodes to the closes point of @xmath0 resp .",
    "alternatively , the same ecdp estimate holds for closest - point decoding in the mod @xmath4 channel discussed below . *",
    "* setup 2 : * the eavesdropper s information , assuming that she has the mod @xmath4 channel and alice chooses uniform random representatives of the coset classes . * * setup 3 : * the eavesdropper s information assuming that alice uses gaussian coset coding , also discussed below .",
    "a common feature suggested by the different bounds and setups is for secrecy to minimize the function @xmath126 .",
    "this is the function that we are going to optimize for the rayleigh fast fading channel .",
    "the following shaping lattice approach is identical to @xcite , called the mod @xmath4 channel : take three nested lattices @xmath127 called shaping , coset , and code lattice , respectively .",
    "then , the random part @xmath128 described in the general coset coding strategy has a uniform distribution on the @xmath129 $ ] representatives of @xmath130 in @xmath131 .",
    "this is called the uniform representative strategy .    the physical message received by eve",
    "is @xmath132 as given from @xmath133 by the channel equation , but in the mod @xmath4 channel , eve only receives knowledge of the equivalence class @xmath134 .",
    "this is certainly a simplification and contrary to the wiretap assumptions , but it allows a simple derivation of an information bound .      in the discrete gaussian coding ,",
    "the boundary effects of the transmission region are handled by smoothing the boundary . fixing a message @xmath135",
    "the random parts @xmath128 of the message @xmath136 are chosen so that the transmitted vector @xmath137 has the centered discrete gaussian distribution on the shifted lattice @xmath138",

    "the variance @xmath141 appearing in the continuous gaussians , called the shaping variance , should be taken large enough compared to @xmath2 ; see @xcite .",

    "this given in terms of the number field discriminant @xmath324 as @xmath325 .",
    "the numerical results for @xmath326 and @xmath327 are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pce_flatness ] .",
    "similar plots were obtained for different values of the @xmath328 , but for the values in the figures , the numerical probability estimate @xmath320 is comparable but still larger than its `` complete secrecy value '' @xmath329 .",
    "there is a clear correlation between the discriminant and the ecdp bound .",
    "the discriminant is related to numerous other properties of the number field and its lattice that could explain the previous plot .",
    "we test this briefly as follows . given the lll - reduced generator vectors @xmath330 of any algebraic lattice , where @xmath331 is the shortest lattice vector , we define @xmath332 , @xmath333 by @xmath334 then @xmath335 the lattice @xmath336 generated by @xmath337 , @xmath338, ... ,@xmath339 has then generators whose length varies at most by factor two .",
    "since we started from an lll - reduced basis , the generators of @xmath336 should be near - orthogonal , and thus we expect it to have a reasonably dense sphere - packing , even if this argument is not completely rigorous due to the ambiguity of reduced bases .",
    "furthermore , @xmath336 is fully diverse , since scaled by @xmath340 , it will become a sublattice of the original full - diversity lattice generated by @xmath330 .",
    "now , after the described sublattice procedure the ecdp seems not to depend on the discriminant anymore , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : pce_flatness_sub ] .",
    "most importantly , comparing the values of the ecdp in this and the previous example , we can see that the sublattice procedure vastly improved the ecdp estimate and that all lattices now perform quite equally .",
    "the latter observation is remarkable in that the construction of the lattices @xmath336 by no means guarantees a particularly dense sphere packing , or that the different @xmath336 would have similar packing density .",
    "this hints that a moderately dense sphere packing is good enough for wiretap applications .",
    "it was motivated that full - diversity ( or local - diversity ) coset lattices would be beneficial . in figure",
    "[ fig : zn ] , we have plotted the ecdp bounds as a function of @xmath307 .",
    "we compare the unit lattice @xmath341 and full - diversity lattices obtained from sublattice procedure described in sec .",
    "[ subsec : sublattices ] .",
    "figure [ fig : zn ] shows that the ecdp is indeed always smaller for the full - diversity lattices . at most , there is a difference by a factor of approximately @xmath342 .",
    "secondly , recall that in the limit @xmath343 , we obtained the sphere - packing criterion .",
    "the plot agrees with this heuristic , since for large values of @xmath307 , the best and worst full - diversity lattices are near each other , with a gap to the unit lattice @xmath341 . in the limit",
    "@xmath343 the gaps are equally large .",
    "next , we study the correlation of the ins and the ecdp , discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : ins / theoretical ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ins ] , we have depicted the ecdp bound @xmath320 as a function of the ins approximation . since ins is a lagre - snr approximation , we have chosen the largest value of @xmath307 for which lattice design plays a role by our previous example .",
    "the left plot depicts the randomly generated algebraic lattices and the right plot the sublattices @xmath336 of sec .",
    "[ subsec : sublattices ] . in the right plot",
    ", there is little correlation between the two variables .",
    "note also that all the lattices in the right plot have smaller ecdp but larger ins than the left plot .",
    "the left plot shows a correlation .",
    "we expect that this due to the fact that before the sublattice procedure , the ecdp bound correlates strongly with the discriminant of the underlying number field , as motivated in sec .",
    "[ subsec : disc ] .",
    "the same property has been shown to hold for the ins both theoretically @xcite and numerically @xcite . regarding this numerical example , the discussion in section [ subsec : ins / theoretical ] , and the fact that the average flatness factor is a natural generalization of the flatness factor to fading channels , we suggest using the average flatness factor as a design criterion rather than the inverse norm sum .",
    "analogously , considering the inverse determinant sums appearing in a mimo approximation of eve s probability bound @xcite , these results suggest preferring the probability bound form , also derived originally in @xcite . as a final remark",
    ", we remind that the inverse norm and determinant sums remain as a relevant approximation in the design of reliable lattices .      in figure",
    "[ fig : pce_flatness ] , one can see one of the lattices behave differently than all others .",
    "this turned out to be a field extension with a square - root . to exemplify the effect of square - roots , we consider algebraic lattices of biquadratic fields @xmath344",
    ", @xmath345 . a plot corresponding to that in fig .",
    "[ fig : pce_flatness ] but for biquadratic fields with small primes is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : biq ] .",
    "it is clear that the ecdp estimates now grow faster and in a less predictable manner as @xmath325 grows , but we have no straightforward explanation for this .",
    "this nevertheless exemplifies the fact that number - theoretic properties of the underlying field extension may drastically affect the performance of the lattice .",

    "then , we have @xmath367 and @xmath368 hence , @xmath369 where @xmath370 is a suitable vector .",
    "this form of the pdf @xmath207 allows us to bound the variational distance to @xmath371 .",
