    "when observed with high - sensitivity spectropolarimeters , the linearly polarized spectrum of the solar radiation coming from quiet regions close to the limb ( the so - called `` second solar spectrum '' ) reveals a complex structure and an impressive richness of spectral details @xcite . we know that the second solar spectrum is the observational signature of atomic polarization ( i.e. , population imbalances and quantum interference between different magnetic sublevels ) , produced by the absorption and scattering of anisotropic radiation .",
    "however , the physics of scattering polarization in an optically thick plasma , such as the extended solar atmosphere , is very complicated and a general theory for multilevel systems is still lacking .",
    "it is thus natural that many of the @xmath0 signals of the second solar spectrum were considered as enigmatic by their discoverers , as well as a true challenge for the theorists ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath2 , with the reference direction for positive @xmath3 parallel to the nearest solar limb . ]",
    "at present , the most challenging @xmath0 signals are those observed in the d@xmath1 lines of na  i and ba  ii at 5896   and 4934   , respectively ( see figures 2 and 5 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the aim of this letter is to point out a physical mechanism that might be of key importance for explaining such enigmatic linear polarization profiles .",
    "the polarization signals observed by @xcite and @xcite in the d@xmath1 lines of na  i and ba  ii were considered enigmatic because these lines were expected to be intrinsically unpolarizable .",
    "this is because they result from transitions between an upper and a lower level with @xmath4 ( @xmath5 being the total angular momentum ) .",
    "such levels can not carry atomic alignment , so that no linear polarization can in principle be produced in these lines in weakly magnetized regions of the solar atmosphere .",
    "( @xmath6 being the magnetic quantum number ) are unevenly populated .",
    "when the upper and/or lower level of a line transition is aligned , then the emergent radiation is in general linearly polarized , even in the absence of a magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "] however , 100% of sodium and about 18% of barium have hyperfine structure ( hfs ) .",
    "both sodium ( @xmath7na ) and the barium isotopes with hfs ( @xmath8ba and @xmath9ba ) have nuclear spin @xmath10 . in such isotopes ,",
    "the upper and lower @xmath5-levels of the d@xmath1 line transition thus split into two hfs @xmath11-levels ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with @xmath11 the total , electronic plus nuclear , angular momentum ) , which can carry atomic alignment .",
    "in fact , taking the hfs of sodium into account , @xcite concluded that if there is a substantial amount of atomic alignment in the ground level ( i.e. , in the lower @xmath12 and @xmath13 levels of the sodium d@xmath1 and d@xmath14 lines ) , then a significant @xmath0 signal is produced in the d@xmath1 line . in his investigation of the sodium doublet ,",
    "@xcite considered the unmagnetized case and assumed frequency - coherent scattering and a constant pumping radiation field within each d - line .    in landi",
    "deglinnocenti s ( 1998 ) modeling of the sodium d@xmath1 line , the ensuing @xmath0 profile vanishes if the alignment of the ground @xmath11-levels is destroyed .",
    "such lower @xmath11-levels are long - lived and therefore their atomic alignment is very sensitive to depolarizing mechanisms , such as elastic collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms and/or the hanle effect of very weak ( mg ) non - vertical magnetic fields .",
    "accordingly , @xcite concluded that the @xmath0 signal detected by @xcite in the sodium d@xmath1 line implies that depolarization does not occur in the lower solar chromosphere ( where the line - core of the sodium d - lines originates ) , which would seem to rule out the existence of tangled magnetic fields and of inclined , canopy - like fields stronger than 0.01  g. he also pointed out that this is difficult to understand because there is substantial evidence from other types of observations for both types of magnetic field .",
    "this paradox was later reinforced by detailed theoretical investigations on the magnetic sensitivity of the d - lines of na  i @xcite and of ba  ii @xcite , as well as on the depolarizing role of elastic collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms @xcite .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the scattering polarization profile obtained by @xcite is antisymmetric , in contrast with the symmetric peak observed by @xcite , but in agreement with the observations of other researchers ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "the physical mechanism discussed in this letter does not require the presence of atomic polarization in the lower level .",
    "indeed , we will show that by properly taking into account hfs and partial frequency redistribution ( prd ) effects , even without any atomic polarization in the ( long - lived ) lower @xmath11-levels , the scattering of anisotropic d@xmath1-line radiation in the solar atmosphere can produce significant linear polarization in the d@xmath1 lines of ba  ii and na  i.",
    "we model the intensity and linear polarization profiles of the d@xmath1 lines of ba  ii and na  i by solving the full non - lte radiative transfer problem for polarized radiation in one - dimensional semi - empirical models of the solar atmosphere , taking prd effects into account . to this aim",
    ", we apply the redistribution matrix approach outlined in @xcite , which can be applied also to the case of a two - level atom with hfs , under the assumptions that the lower @xmath11-levels are unpolarized and infinitely sharp .",
    "as previously discussed , these approximations appear to be suitable since the lower level of the d@xmath1 lines of ba  ii and na  i is the ( long - lived ) ground level .",
    "we recall that our redistribution matrix is given by the linear combination of two terms , which describe purely coherent scattering ( @xmath15 ) and completely redistributed scattering ( @xmath16 ) in the atom rest frame , respectively .",
    "we investigate the d@xmath1 line of barium accounting for the contribution of all its seven stable isotopes .",
    "the two odd isotopes ( @xmath8ba and @xmath9ba , both with nuclear spin @xmath10 ) are described through a two - level model atom with hfs , the five even isotopes ( about 82.18% in abundance ) are described through a two - level model atom without hfs .",
    "the d@xmath1 line of sodium is modeled through a two - level model atom with hfs ( sodium has a single stable isotope , @xmath7na , with @xmath10 ) .    as clear from the grotrian diagram shown in the left panel of figure  1 , in the isotopes with hfs",
    ", each upper @xmath11-level can be excited from the two lower @xmath11-levels through two transitions that are very close in frequency ( about 70  m apart in the barium isotopes with hfs , and about 20  m apart in sodium ) . due to such small frequency separation , the assumption that the pumping radiation field is the same in the two hfs transitions appears to be an excellent approximation for modeling these lines .",
    "however , under this hypothesis , and assuming that the lower level is unpolarized , no atomic polarization can be produced in the upper @xmath11-levels , and therefore no polarization can be obtained in the emergent radiation .",
    "this can be seen , for example , from the statistical equilibrium equations for a two - level atom with hfs derived in landi deglinnocenti & landolfi ( 2004 , hereafter ll04 ) . under the hypothesis of unpolarized lower level ,",
    "such equations can be analytically solved , and the multipole components of the density matrix of the upper levels result to be given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the einstein coefficients for spontaneous emission and for absorption , respectively , @xmath20 is the total number density of atoms , @xmath21 is the number density of atoms in the lower @xmath5-level , and @xmath22 is the frequency separation between the hfs levels @xmath23 and @xmath24 . since the incident field ( described in equation  ( 1 ) through the radiation field tensor @xmath25 , see equation  ( 5.157 ) of ll04 )",
    "is assumed to be constant across the various hfs transitions ( this is one of the hypotheses the theory described in ll04 is based on ) , it is possible to perform the sum over @xmath26 , thus obtaining @xmath27 observing that the first 6-@xmath28 symbol in the second line of equation  ( 2 ) vanishes for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , we immediately see that under the above - mentioned hypotheses , no atomic polarization ( either alignment or @xmath11-state interference , both being described by the multipole components with @xmath30 ) can be induced in the upper @xmath11-levels of the d@xmath1 line transition . indeed , in the previous investigations on this line , in which the pumping radiation field was assumed to be identical in the various hfs transitions , either because the investigation was carried out by applying the complete frequency redistribution ( crd ) theory presented in ll04 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or because this was assumed by definition , though considering coherent scattering ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the authors concluded that the only way to obtain a scattering polarization signal in the core of the d@xmath1 line is by assuming that a given amount of atomic polarization is present in the lower level .    in this investigation , on the contrary , we neglect lower level polarization but we take into account , through the @xmath15 term of the redistribution matrix , that the pumping radiation field can , in principle , be different in the various hfs transitions ( see the right panel of figure  1 for the case of barium ) .",
    "although such difference is in many cases very small , we find that this allows atomic polarization to be induced in the upper @xmath11-levels , giving rise to an appreciable polarization signal in the core of the d@xmath1 line ( see the next section ) .",
    "according to this physical mechanism , the amplitude of the linear polarization signal produced in the d@xmath1 line is expected to be higher when the hfs splitting of the lower level is larger .    the two - level atom models ( either with or without hfs ) considered in this investigation",
    "do not allow us to take quantum interference between the upper @xmath5-levels of the d@xmath1 and d@xmath14 lines into account .",
    "this physical ingredient can actually be safely neglected for the investigation of the ba  ii d@xmath1 line , since it is about 380   away from d@xmath14 , but it is known to play an important role in the modeling of the na  i d - lines , which are only 6   apart .",
    "on the other hand , an accurate modeling of the scattering polarization in the ba  ii d@xmath1 and d@xmath14 lines would require to account for the radiative and collisional coupling of the upper levels of such lines with the metastable @xmath31 and @xmath32 levels .",
    "this coupling , which is not present in neutral sodium since it does not have such metastable levels , can not be accounted for within our two - level atom modeling .",
    "as we shall see below , in spite of such limitations , our approach is suitable to show that the physical mechanism identified in this investigation might be of key relevance for understanding the enigmatic d@xmath1 line polarization .",
    "figure  2 shows the emergent stokes @xmath2 and @xmath0 profiles of the ba  ii d@xmath1 line calculated in the semi - empirical model c of fontenla et al .",
    "( 1993 ; hereafter , fal - c model ) .",
    "the profiles in the left panel of figure  2 have been calculated in the limit of crd , following the theoretical approach of ll04 . as discussed in section  2 , within the framework of such theory",
    ", the absorption of radiation from an unpolarized lower level can not induce any atomic polarization in the upper @xmath11-levels and therefore the d@xmath1 line must behave as intrinsically unpolarizable .",
    "indeed , as shown in the lower left panel of figure  2 , the d@xmath1 line only produces a depolarization of the continuum polarization level ( our calculations account for the contribution of a coherent polarized continuum ) .",
    "the right panels of figure  2 show the results of prd calculations . in this case , through the @xmath15 term of the redistribution matrix , we account for the exact frequency dependence of the pumping radiation field within the d@xmath1 line .",
    "as expected , no signal is obtained if only @xmath33ba ( which is devoid of hfs ) is considered ( see the dotted line ) . however ,",
    "if the contribution of the small fraction ( @xmath34% ) of the barium isotopes with hfs is taken into account , a conspicuous polarization signal is obtained for a line - of - sight ( los ) with @xmath35 ( @xmath36 being the cosine of the heliocentric angle ) .",
    "the @xmath0 signal shows a large positive peak ( about 0.45% ) slightly blueshifted with respect to the line center , and a smaller negative peak ( about @xmath37% ) slightly redshifted . such @xmath0 peaks decrease , though remaining significant , for larger @xmath36 values .",
    "as can be noted by comparing the top panels of figure  2 , the stokes @xmath2 profile is not very sensitive to prd effects , except at the very line center where the prd calculation gives slightly smaller intensity values .",
    "particularly interesting , on the other hand , is the significant broadening of the stokes @xmath2 profile produced by the small fraction of barium isotopes with hfs ( compare the solid and dotted lines ) .",
    "the results of figure  3 are also noteworthy .",
    "the bottom panel shows the @xmath0 profiles calculated in three different semi - empirical models of the solar atmosphere ( the temperature structure of such models is plotted in the upper panel ) .",
    "as can be observed , the @xmath0 signals are not very different .",
    "this small sensitivity to the thermal model is good news , because the @xmath0 signal of the ba  ii d@xmath1 line produced by the physical mechanism discussed in section  2 is sensitive to the upper - level hanle effect and therefore to magnetic fields in the gauss range .    in figure  4",
    ", we show the results that we have obtained for the d@xmath1 line of na  i. the sensitivity of the @xmath0 signal of this stronger line to the thermal model is more noticeable , with the ( relatively cool ) fal - x model producing the largest peaks .",
    "such @xmath0 peaks are much weaker than those observed by @xcite and than those obtained in the ba  ii d@xmath1 line .",
    "the calculated @xmath0 signals are much weaker in sodium than in barium because the hfs splitting of the ground level is about four times smaller in na  i.",
    "two physical mechanisms able to produce a scattering polarization signal in the na  i and ba  ii d@xmath1 lines have been identified up to now .",
    "hfs is a fundamental ingredient in both of them .",
    "such physical mechanisms are not mutually exclusive , and are probably at work simultaneously in the solar atmosphere , especially in the case of the na  i d@xmath1 line .",
    "one mechanism is that pointed out by @xcite , which requires the presence of a substantial amount of ground - level polarization . as clarified by @xcite , this mechanism , which operates even when the pumping radiation is constant within the d lines",
    "( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , requires taking into account the absorption of anisotropic radiation in the d@xmath14 line ( whose upper level has @xmath38 ) and to assume that depolarizing mechanisms do not completely destroy the atomic alignment that _ repopulation pumping _ produces in the long - lived lower @xmath11-levels . under such circumstances , the atomic alignment of the lower and upper @xmath11-levels of the d@xmath1 line ( and therefore its scattering polarization signal ) are sensitive to the same ( mg ) magnetic field strengths .    in this letter",
    ", we have shown that the absorption and scattering of anisotropic d@xmath1-line radiation within the solar atmosphere can directly produce linear polarization in the d@xmath1 line , without any need for ground - level polarization .",
    "this is possible if one takes into account that the solar d@xmath1-line radiation has a non - negligible spectral structure over the short frequency interval spanned by the hfs transitions .",
    "the fact that small variations of the pumping radiation field between very close hfs transitions is able to create a significant amount of atomic polarization in the upper @xmath11-levels of the d@xmath1 lines is certainly an unexpected and important result .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 signals are not so easily destroyed by elastic collisions and/or magnetic fields .",
    "the amplitude and shape of the calculated @xmath0 profile of the ba  ii d@xmath1 line are similar to the observed ones ( see figure  5 of * ? ? ?",
    "the main discrepancy concerns the slightly redshifted peak , which reaches a negative value in the theoretical profile , while it remains positive in the observation . in our opinion",
    ", such discrepancy does not invalidate our conclusion that the physical mechanism we have discussed in this letter may be a key ingredient for explaining the enigmatic linear polarization of the ba  ii d@xmath1 line .",
    "this is because our ba  ii model atom does not include the metastable @xmath31 and @xmath32 levels , which may have a significant impact on the d@xmath1 line polarization ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* concerning the ca  ii ir triplet ) .",
    "the amplitudes of the @xmath0 profiles observed in the d@xmath1 lines of na  i and ba  ii are of the same order of magnitude , but the calculated @xmath0 signal of the na  i d@xmath1 line is one order of magnitude smaller .",
    "this is due to fact that the hfs splitting of the ground level of sodium is about four times smaller than that of barium .",
    "we believe that this discrepancy with the observation does not rule out the possibility that the physical mechanism described in this letter may play a key role also for explaining the enigmatic linear polarization of the na  i d@xmath1 line .",
    "we plan to include in our modeling the quantum interference between the @xmath11-levels pertaining to the two upper @xmath5-levels of the sodium doublet . this additional physical ingredient will probably influence the shape of the @xmath0 profile , even in the neighborhood of the sodium d@xmath1 line core .",
    "in addition to this , we believe that if there is a non - negligible amount of ground - level polarization , then the physical mechanism discussed in this letter should induce a larger @xmath0 signal .",
