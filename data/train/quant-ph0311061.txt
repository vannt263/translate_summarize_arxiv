    "quantum cryptography , the study of cryptographic protocols with security built on the basis of quantum effects , has been mainly developed along the line of the original bb84 protocol @xcite and its variations @xcite .",
    "the focus is on _ key generation _ ( key expansion ) , the establishment of a fresh key @xcite between two users , which is often referred to in the literature as quantum key distribution . without the use of quantum effects",
    ", it was known that ( classical ) key generation is possible whenever the user and the attacker have different observations ( ciphertexts ) from which the user can derive a performance advantage @xcite , a process to be referred to as advantage creation . in bb84 type quantum cryptographic schemes ,",
    "advantage creation is obtained through intrusion - level detection that quantitatively assures the attacker s observation to be inferior to the users , thus allowing _ privacy distillation _ ( amplification ) @xcite to essentially eliminate the attacker s information on the final key generated .",
    "classically , this approach can not succeed because the attacker can always , in principle , clone a copy identical to the user s observation , and no advantage can possibly be created .",
    "quantum mechanically , there is a general tradeoff between the attacker s disturbance and her information on the user s observation . by estimating the intrusion level",
    ", the user can ( probabilistically ) assure a better observation for decoding the original data , from which a fresh key may be generated .",
    "there are several problems , in theory and in practice , with the bb84 type quantum protocols . among them",
    "are the necessity of using weak but accurate signal source , a near perfect transmission line , sensitive and fast quantum detectors , as well as the difficulties of having appropriate amplifiers or repeaters to compensate loss , developing specific practical protocols with quantfiable security against all realistic attacks , and achieving reasonable efficiency with such protocols .",
    "these problems are summarized in section viii and a few hitherto un - analyzed problems are summarized in appendix a. as a consequence , the usefulness of bb84 type protocols is severely curtailed , especially for commercial applications . most of these problems can be traced to the need of measuring the intrusion level for balance between the user and attacker s information on the data , and the necessity of using weak signals . in this paper ,",
    "a new type of quantum protocols , to be called kcq ( keyed communication or keyed cdma in quantum noise ) , is presented .",
    "they do not need to involve intrusion - level detection and permit the use of coherent states with considerable energy , thus alleviating the above problems .",
    "they can be implemented using optical technology and readily integrated with existing optical communication formats .",
    "it is hoped that they would quickly bring quantum cryptography to practical application .",
    "the basic idea of kcq is to utilize a shared secret key between the users to determine the quantum signal set to be chosen separately for each information sequence , the quantum noise being inherent in the quantum signal set from quantum detection and communication theory @xcite .",
    "such shared secret keys have also _ not _ been used in classical key generation @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the use of a shared secret key is necessary in bb84 type protocols and classical public discussion protocols @xcite for the purpose of message authentication or realizing the public channel .",
    "in contrast , a shared secret key is utilized in an essential way on kcq protocols , but a fresh key can be generated that is much larger than the secret key used during key generation .",
    "for kcq key generation , advantage creation is obtained from the different optimal or near - optimal quantum receiver performance between the user who knows the key and the attacker who does not when she makes her quantum measurement , even when a copy of the quantum signal is granted to the attacker for the purpose of bounding her information _ without _ intrusion - level detection .",
    "this difference in performance has _ no _ classical analog .",
    "the kcq approach evolves from the anonymous key encryption method described in ref .",
    "exactly how and why this approach works is explained both generally and concretely in this paper .        in practice , infinite dimensional state spaces to be referred as _",
    "qumodes _ provide the standard framework for describing coherent - state laser signals . as in classical communication systems , qumode systems allow the suppression of errors with signal energy without error control coding that may complicate security proofs and hinder the development of specific protocols .",
    "also , kcq can be used for direct encryption , which has different security performance criteria for key generation apart from the inefficient one - time pad approach .",
    "the basic use of kcq in binary and @xmath0-ary detection of coherent - state qumode systems will be described . in particular , a specific coherent pulse - position modulation scheme , to be called cppm , is shown to have many dramatic characteristics including automatic privacy distillation , secure key generation and data transmission over long - distance telecomm fibers , and information - theoretic security against known - plaintext attacks .",
    "this last characteristics is impossible in conventional cryptography , the possibility of which has also never been suggested in quantum cryptography .",
    "these qumode results are presented in sections v and vi , and direct encryption briefly described section vii .",
    "they are qualitatively compared to other quantum key generation ( qkg ) schemes in section viii .",
    "detailed quantitative development of cppm and other schemes for operation in realistic environment will be given in the future .",
    "key generation via kcq on qubits is developed in sections ii . in section iii ,",
    "a general analysis of the kcq approach and qkg security against joint attacks are presented with the more complete criterion of error profile instead of mere mutual information . a protocol efficiency criterion on qkg protocols",
    "is introduced in section iv , which should be insensitive to system parameter fluctuation for a protocol to be realistically useful . in appendix",
    "a , we briefly discuss some serious gaps in the qkg unconditional security proofs against joint attacks given in the literature . in appendix",
    "b , we respond to several criticisms on @xmath1 , a coherent - state kcq scheme for direct encryption upon which significant experimental progress has been made . for readers who want to go directly to the core of our new results",
    ", please read sections iii , v , and vi .",
    "we consider a specific kcq qubit scheme for key generation , to be called qk , to introduce and explain the characteristics of the kcq approach to quantum cryptography .",
    "let an arbitrary qubit state be represented by a real vector on the bloch - poincare sphere . as depicted in fig .",
    "1 , an even number of @xmath2 points uniformly distributed on a fixed great circle on the sphere , corresponding to @xmath3 possible orthonormal bases , are used as possible quantum signal states for the bit value b @xmath4 .",
    "the opposite points on a diameter of the circle for a given basis are the two orthonormal states for the two possible bit values .",
    "the two neighbors of each of the @xmath2 points are taken to represent a different bit value .",
    "a shared secret key @xmath5 between two users , adam ( a ) and babe ( b ) , is used to select a specific basis for each qubit . a secret _ polarity bit _",
    "may also be introduced to be added to the data bit for randomizing the polarity of the basis . instead of using the same @xmath5 for each b ,",
    "a long running key @xmath6 obtained from the output of a standard ( classical ) encryption mechanism with @xmath5 as the input may be used to yield different basis selection and polarity bits for different b s in an @xmath7-sequence of input data @xmath8 .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "1 where , e.g. , the enc box may represent a synchronous stream cipher or even just a linear feedback shift register ( lfsr ) for the key extension . from a seed key @xmath5 , avoiding the term ` key expansion ' for possible confusions .",
    "] thus , generally a total of @xmath9 bits from @xmath6 would be used to determine the polarity bit and the selection of one of @xmath3 possible bases .",
    "the key generation process goes as follows .",
    "adam picks a random @xmath7-bit data sequence @xmath8 , modulating @xmath7 corresponding qubits by using @xmath6 to determine the polarity and basis for each qubit .",
    "babe generates the same @xmath6 to decide on the quantum measurement basis for each b in @xmath8 , and decode the bit value by the corresponding measurement .",
    "a classical error correcting code ( cecc ) may be used on the @xmath7-sequence to eliminate noise in the system that may originate anywhere , including source , transmission line , and detector .",
    "privacy distillation may then be employed to bring the attacker eve ( e ) s bit error rate @xmath10 on the final key @xmath11 to any desired small level .",
    "intrusion - level detection is avoided by granting e a _ full _ copy of the quantum signal for the purpose of bounding her information .",
    "advantage creation is obtained from the different ( optimal ) quantum receiver performance , in an individual or joint attack , between b who knows @xmath5 and e who does not .",
    "further data and signal _ keyless randomization _ may be introduced by a to guarantee security against joint attack and to improve the key - bit generation efficiency @xmath12 .",
    "finally , the new key @xmath11 is verified to be correct by the use of another short key @xmath13 , which may be done openly ( publicly , i.e. , the ciphertext is available to e ) .",
    "all these steps and features would be described and explained in detail in this and the following sections .",
    "there are significant theoretical and practical advantage of the qk scheme of fig . 1 as compared to bb84 .",
    "in particular , it can handle all system imperfection and noise of any origin at the same time , and produce reasonable key - bit generation efficiency @xmath12 .",
    "the substantive use of secret keys in the key generation process other than message authentication has been introduced before @xcite , in particular , it has been used in @xcite in selecting one of the two possible bases in bb84 for improving @xmath12 , while keeping the other protocol steps including intrusion - level detection intact .",
    "in contrast , the security of our kcq scheme is derived from a different quantum principle , the difference in optimal quantum receiver performance with and without the key , rather than the information / disturbance tradeoff underlying bb84 and related schemes .",
    "our use of a long running key @xmath6 and large @xmath2 is not only essential in obtaining high @xmath12 , it is also essential for obtaining complexity - based security against known - plaintext attacks when kq is used for direct encryption",
    ". it also plays a role in yielding reasonable key generation rates for coding - theoretic protocols with unconditional security .",
    "in contrast , the unconditional security proof described in ref .",
    "@xcite is not complete even with intrusion - level detection , due to the quantum state correlation or memory among different qubits induced by the shared secret key , in addition to the previous problems in such security proofs are described in appendix a. indeed , it is a major problem in using a secret key that one needs to show there is a net resulting key generated after subtracting the original key used , or that the system is somehow worth the @xmath14 cost .",
    "most significantly , the use of shared secret keys in our kcq approach makes possible the development of large - signal schemes with conventional optical technology as described in sections v and vi .",
    "we first analyze the security of the above qk scheme under joint attack on the seed key @xmath5 and a specific kind of individual attack on the data @xmath15 , given the quantum ciphertext .",
    "in contrast to data encryption , there is no known - plaintext attack @xcite in key generation because one _ presumes _ a can generate completely random data bits unknown to both b and e a priori . the problem of how this can be done at high rate is a separate issue common to every kind of cryptography .",
    "the term ` individual attack ' is ambiguous , but the attack considered in the quantum cryptography literature under this label usually refers to the situation where e prepares the probe / interaction to each qubit of the quantum signal sequence individually and _ identically _ , measures each of her probe individually and _ identically _ , and processes the resulting information _ independently _ from one qubit to the other . since , for bounding e s information , we grant e a copy of the quantum signal sequence , the optimal performance of which clearly provides an _ upper bound _ on e s performance with an actual inferior copy obtained via a probe , there is no question of probe / interaction in the attack on such systems , only individual - qubit versus collective measurements .",
    "possible disruption of the signal by e will be discussed in sections iii.f .",
    "the individual attack on the data analyzed quantitatively in the following is of the same nature as that in the bb84 literature @xcite , namely a constant measurement on each qubit and independent processing .",
    "we will call such attacks _ constant individual attacks_.    such an attack does _ not _ include all possible attacks within a reasonable limitation on e s technology , in both the bb84 and our schemes .",
    "if one may limit e s measurement to individual qubit ones , perhaps because measurement across many qubits is difficult to make , there is no reason to limit e s classical processing after measurement to qubit - by - qubit separately , except for ease of analysis !",
    "a more detailed general classification of attacks and their analysis will be provided in the future .",
    "generally , let @xmath16 be the quantum state corresponding to the data @xmath17 ( single bit or a bit sequence ) and running key sequence @xmath18 instead of @xmath19 for values of @xmath6 to simplify notation , which should not cause confusion .",
    "] that is used to determine the basis and/or polarity of the qk scheme for that length of @xmath17 . for @xmath3 possible bases and a single bit @xmath17",
    ", there is @xmath20 bits in @xmath18 for both basis and polarity determination .",
    "each @xmath16 can be represented as a real vector @xmath21 of norm @xmath22 on the great circle , the angle between any two nearest neighbor vectors is @xmath23 radian .",
    "the quantum ciphertext available to e for upperbounding her performance is @xmath16 where both @xmath17 and @xmath18 are random .    for the purpose of attacking the key",
    ", the quantum ciphertext reduces to @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the a priori probability of the data @xmath17 . by an optimal measurement on the qubits",
    ", the probability of correctly identifying the key is obtained from @xmath26 via quantum detection theory .",
    "we may let @xmath17 be any @xmath7-sequence , so that @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 for each @xmath7-bit sequence .",
    "it is easily seen from the quantum modulation format that @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the qubit identity operator , irrespective of the nature of @xmath18 .",
    "thus , @xmath26 is independent of @xmath18 and the quantum ciphertext provides no information on @xmath18 at all .",
    "specifically , any processing on @xmath26 yields an a posteriori probability on @xmath18 equal to the a priori probability @xmath31 , which may be chosen to be uniform for maximum security .",
    "consider now the attack on @xmath17 , through the decision on @xmath17 from measurement on the quantum ciphertext in state @xmath32 .",
    "for individual attacks of the kind described above , one obtains @xmath33 corresponding to a single bit by tracing out the rest of the data sequence .",
    "when a polarity bit is used from @xmath18 , it is easily seen that e s bit error probability is @xmath34 by averaging on the two polarities alone .",
    "when the polarity bit is not used , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are different .",
    "the optimum @xmath10 is given by @xmath37 @xcite , in terms of the trace distance @xmath38 between @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which can be explicitly evaluated for a single qubit , with resulting @xmath39 ^{1/2}.\\ ] ] this @xmath10 goes as @xmath40 for large @xmath2 and can thus be made arbitrarily small .    that it is unreasonable to consider only such limited individual attacks",
    "can be seen as follows .",
    "suppose a key @xmath18 of @xmath41 bits is used repeatedly to determine the polarity and basis choice of each qubit state in a sequence . even though the above individual attack error rate for e is the ideal 1/2 , in actuality e has a probability @xmath42 , @xmath43 number of bits in @xmath18 , of completely decrypting @xmath17 by guessing @xmath18 and using it on every qubit . in a similar way",
    ", the same problem arises for a running key obtained from a short seed key @xmath5 .",
    "that is , the correlation between bits in @xmath17 due to @xmath18 can be exploited by joint classical processing on individual qubit measurements .",
    "the presence of the encryption box in fig .",
    "1 does not improve the situation fundamentally for information - theoretic security even if the seed key @xmath5 is long , because e can generate @xmath6 from a guessed @xmath5 as the encryption mechanism is openly known .",
    "before we discuss general joint attacks in the next section , a number of issues on the above development would first be cleared up .    first , aside from information - theoretic security issue , the encryption box in fig .",
    "1 always increases the security of qk through physical and computational complexity , and it also increases the efficiency of key - bit generation fundamentally .",
    "since there is often a trade - off between security and efficiency , increasing the efficiency without compromising security is in a sense increasing security ( for a given efficiency ) .",
    "suppose the encryption box is a stream cipher that outputs a long running key @xmath6 from a seed key @xmath5 .",
    "if it is a maximum length lfsr of @xmath14 stages , then @xmath6 up to length @xmath44 is ` random ' in various sense , even though an exact knowledge of @xmath6 of length @xmath45 is sufficient to determine @xmath5 uniquely from the berlekamp - massey algorithm @xcite . if @xmath5 is used repeatedly without @xmath6 in fig .",
    "1 , the @xmath46 would be correlated by the repeated @xmath18 for short @xmath17-sequence , with any reasonable @xmath14 and @xmath2 . a joint ( measurement ) attack can then be launched much more easily because the _ physical complexity _ - in this case the correlated qubit measurement - needed is much smaller than the one that comes from a long @xmath6 from the same @xmath5 . while @xmath6 is not open to observation in the present case , is open to partial observation .",
    "then direct complexity - based security obtains from the need to inverting such imprecise @xmath6 to @xmath5 .",
    "] _ computational complexity _ obtains in any event when one attempts to correlate the different bits in @xmath17 through the unknown key . to be able to correlate data bits through its repeated use . for example , in two uses of one time pad @xmath47 on two random data bits @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we know @xmath50 without knowing @xmath18 .",
    "indeed , no information on @xmath18 is obtained from the observation of @xmath51 and @xmath52 . ]",
    "computational complexity is an excellent security mechanism if can be shown to be exponential , as the grover search can only reduce the exponent by a factor of 1/2 .",
    "long keys with @xmath53 can readily be used in stream ciphers , and searching @xmath54 items is already far beyond the capability of any imagined quantum computer . in conventional cryptography , .",
    "it is distinguished from classical noise cryptography and from quantum cryptography . ]",
    "many stream ciphers are used by themselves as the complete security mechanism . it can be incorporated in schemes such as fig . 1 or the qumodes schemes of refs .",
    "@xcite to increase the overall security in direct encryption .",
    "second , if cloning is possible so that @xmath44 copies of the quantum ciphertext are available , there is no possibility of key generation in principle .",
    "this is because e can use the @xmath44 different keys on the different copies , narrowing down the data to exactly @xmath44 possibilities corresponding to the key uncertainty .",
    "she can then follow whatever processing the users employ on her own data , and the users have succeeded only in obtaining a derived key , not a fresh one , whose randomness comes entirely from the original key without forward secrecy . this _ also explains _ why no key generation is possible when the user and the attacker have the same observation .",
    "note , however , the _ difference _ between cloning and having one full copy .",
    "having one copy is equivalent to the classical situation where many identical copies can be made , because together they do not tell the input data better than just one copy .",
    "quantum mechanically , the quantum uncertainty goes down with the number of copies available from the laws of quantum physics - indeed the state is in principle determined exactly , say by quantum tomography , with an infinite supply of identical copies .",
    "thus , the classical analog of ` cloning ' is the granting of one identical copy , not many ones as in full cloning .",
    "third , the possibility of attacking the data @xmath17 is not completely described by @xmath33 in general .",
    "this is because e knows there is a @xmath46 representation .",
    "thus , she can attack the key via quantum measurement on part of the qubit sequence , and then attack the data with any knowledge she may thus learn .",
    "a similar but less serious situation occurs for attacks on the key via partial attacks on the data first .",
    "these possibilities , however , do not arise in the case of constant individual attack .    before turning to joint attacks , it should be noted that security results against individual attacks are far from useless . in practice ,",
    "a joint attack may require correlated qubit measurement , as the qubit states are correlated through the running key @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the physical complexity of such quantum measurement and the computational complexity introduced through the encryption box would provide very significant security against attacks that can be realistically launched in the foreseeable future . when joint processing of the individual measurement results is performed , the quantum noise introduced in such individual measurement _ already _ yields a noisier copy for the attacker that allows advantage distillation by the user .",
    "this would distinguish our cryptosystem as a truly quantum one that has no classical analog , and give real meaning to the security claim against individual attacks .",
    "performance under different types of such ` individual attacks ' , including ones involving adaptive qubit - by - qubit measurements , will be presented in the future .",
    "consider the operation of qk of fig . 1 for a perfect qubit channel , under joint ( collective ) attack by e where , as a performance bounding technique , she is supposed to have a full identical copy of the n - sequence quantum state as b. she has to make a quantum measurement , however , without knowing the key which she may possess later",
    " see section iii.b for a complete description . here",
    "we would observe that she would not be able to make a perfect decryption with probability equal to @xmath22 for any finite @xmath7 .",
    "after whatever quantum measurement on the n - qubits she made , she still would not be able to make a perfect decryption if k is then given to her .",
    "this is because a perfect decryption occurs when and only when the measurement she made is exactly that prescribed by k. this shows that an advantage is created which may lead to an unconditionally secure protocol with or without the use of further channel coding , as shown in section iii.h . when channel noise is present , a classical error correcting code ( cecc ) on the quantum states may be employed and separate privacy amplification may be required .",
    "the exact quantitative performance will be detailed elsewhere .",
    "in this section , the basic principles underlying key generation via kcq will be explained .",
    "the general principles of key generation will first be reviewed and analyzed , extending the usual framework to include shared secret keys and the more appropriate criterion of error profile in addition to and in place of mutual information .",
    "the quantum nature of kcq will be pinpointed .",
    "the overall steps and structure of a kcq key generation protocol will be exhibited , and the conditions for key generation established .",
    "various basic conditions on key generation will be discussed , particularly in relation to the usual qkg approach .",
    "this section iii and the later qumode key generation section vi that gives the specific qumode qkg protocol cppm may be regarded as the heart and brain of this paper . for a detailed review of the background in classical as well as quantum detection and communication theory for classical information transmission that is crucial for",

    "classically , @xmath57 would be replaced by just an @xmath7-bit channel input sequence @xmath8 corresponding to the @xmath17 in @xmath57 .",

    "the use of such an approach for direct encryption is briefly treated in section vii .",

    "in the following , these points will be fully explained and explicated .",
    "the contrast between kcq and the usual qkg approach , both in theory and in practice , will be highlighted .",
    "a key generation protocol with information - theoretic security , whether it is based on classical or quantum randomness , would consist of the following three logical steps :    \\(i ) _ advantage creation _ :    the users a and b create a communication situation between themselves with an observed random variable @xmath71 for b that leads to a better error performance than that obtained by e from her observed random variable @xmath69 and all her side information .",
    "\\(ii ) _ error correction _ :",
    "the users agree on a generated string that is free of error with high probability if e is absent .",
    "\\(iii ) _ privacy distillation _ :    the users derive from the generated string a generated key @xmath11 on which e s error probability profile satisfies a given security level .",
    "the first step ( i ) may be achieved classically in the presence of different noises for b and e s communication channels with respect to a s data , using perhaps the help of public discussions between a and b. in the quantum key generation approaches so far , ( i ) is achieved via intrusion - level detection , explicit or implicit , that guarantees that a and b have a better communication line than a and e in the sense of mutual information , which is also the privacy distillation criterion used in step ( iii ) . the steps ( ii ) and",
    "( iii ) could be combined by an error correcting code , quantum or classical , that simultaneously performs privacy distillation .",
    "this is indeed the way the usual qkg unconditional security ( existence ) proofs involving css codes @xcite are carried out . in qkg experiments to date , these steps are distinct and a separate privacy distillation code is employed whenever step ( iii ) is implemented . in our kcq protocol",
    "called cppm in section vi , step ( iii ) is automatically achieved in an ideal fashion from the @xmath0-ary signaling scheme employed .",
    "more generally , we will show that privacy amplification is unnecessary in most cases when the proper criterion of e s optimal error probability is used in place of her mutual information .      in the literatures @xcite",
    ", it was shown that if a situation is obtained in which the mutual information between a and b , @xmath72 for the random variables @xmath73 and @xmath74 in a and b s possessions , is bigger than that between a and e , @xmath75 , or that of b and e from the symmetrically inter - changeable roles of a and b , key generation is possible .",
    "that is , an information - theoretic existence proof is given under the condition @xmath76 with the conclusion that an asymptotic key generation rate @xmath77 $ ] is possible between a and b with the ( total ) amount of mutual information e has on the key generated being arbitrarily small . in these results ,",
    "there is no shared secret key between a and b.    such results can be generalized to include the use of a shared secret key @xmath5 as follows .",
    "e is going to observe her channel output @xmath78 without the benefit of knowing @xmath5 .",
    "however , one has to make sure that the resulting @xmath11 generated between a and b is fresh , i.e. , statistically independent of @xmath5 and e s observation @xmath78 , i.e. @xmath79 .",
    "indeed , e can try every possible @xmath44 keys on her observation @xmath78 to determine the possible @xmath73 s . a conceptually convenient way to characterize",
    "this situation is to give e the key @xmath5 after she made her observation @xmath78 .",
    "using the notation @xmath80 to denote her information in this situation where @xmath81 denotes the joint random variables @xmath78 and @xmath5 , ( [ aaa ] ) generalizes to @xmath82 in ( [ aab ] ) , b is of course supposed to know @xmath5 when she plans to observe @xmath74 .",
    "classically , the condition ( [ aab ] ) may result if there is a limit on the data storage so that e can not have the same observation as b who can just store the relevant data using the knowledge of @xmath5 , as in the broadcast scheme of maurer .",
    "while the shared secret key @xmath5 is what occurs in the above @xmath80 with which e may use to estimate @xmath11 in kcq protocols , @xmath5 may be interpreted as all the side information e obtains in other qkg protocols such as bb84 , or as the missing information that allows the conditional entropy @xmath83 in a classical random channel protocol .",
    "these useful interpretation would be used later .    the following important relation between any three random variables should be noted : @xmath84 in the kcq context , @xmath85 and @xmath86 can be used in lieu of @xmath87 .",

    "quantum mechanically , the knowledge of @xmath60 that specifies the mapping from classical data to quantum states would allow b to choose the optimum or near - optimum quantum measurement to discriminate among the data . without knowing @xmath60 , on the average e would need to pick a quantum measurement that would allow her to make reasonable estimates for different @xmath89 s , which leads to an inferior performance compared to b for a specific @xmath89 .",
    "this situation clearly obtains when e does not have long - term quantum memory to hold her copy of the quantum signal before she has to make a quantum measurement to extract the information without knowing the key . in practice ,",
    "the key @xmath60 can be erased or kept secret indefinitely from e , as e really would never have @xmath60 , and she has to make a quantum measurement without knowing @xmath5 _ even _ if she has long - term quantum memory .",
    "classically , there is no need for e to know @xmath5 in order for her to be able to correlate in a definite manner the different data connected by @xmath5 , such as the different session keys generated from a master key .",

    "the following comment is in order .",
    "privacy distillation moves e s uncertainty among @xmath7 bits to @xmath159 bits when @xmath160 bits .",
    "if @xmath11 is to be used as one - time pad , such a move is necessary for near perfect security level .",
    "however , @xmath11 would often be used as a seed key in some other cipher . in that case",
    "the privacy distillation merely reduces the key size of @xmath11 , not its randomness to e as already observed in ref .",
    "@xcite . particularly for stream ciphers which may have similar speed and complexity for different key sizes",
    ", it may not be worth the trouble to carry out any privacy distillation before the raw @xmath11 is used .    in attacking a kcq system , e may always guess the seed key @xmath60 and make corresponding optimum quantum measurements to decrypt the data .",
    "her success probability , however , is only @xmath161 .",
    "if she guessed the key @xmath60 incorrectly , the probability she would get @xmath162 correctly from @xmath67 is exponentially small in @xmath7 because different keys @xmath89 lead to different @xmath57 for the same data .",
    "furthermore , she has only ( at most ) one copy of the quantum signal ( with energy at the designed security level in the qumode case ) to launch this attack once .",
    "this corresponds to the above error profile with @xmath163 but no more than one trial .",
    "note that the seed key @xmath60 has to be guessed in total as it is not being used in a bit by bit or segment by segment manner .",
    "as is evident form fig .",
    "2 , e has to deal with the @xmath8 chosen by a and has no independent way to encode her own channel @xmath164 .",
    "thus , by choosing a rate @xmath165 in between ( [ aaa ] ) and ( [ aab ] ) , one may be able to force the second term in @xmath166 to be zero and obtain @xmath167 as a consequence of the shannon coding theorem and its strong converses @xcite for memoryless channels .",
    "the strong converse states that the block error rate goes to @xmath22 exponentially in the block length @xcite at rates above capacity , which may already imply @xmath168 as will be seen in the cppm scheme of section vi .",
    "when a shared secret key is used , the classical channels become ones with memory , and the corresponding coding theorems and their converse @xcite may be employed .",
    "since such results on channels with memory are typically weaker quantitatively , we may employ the memoryless results using the following approach .",
    "a may transmit at an input bit rate @xmath165 satisfying @xmath169 where @xmath170 refers to the mutual information between @xmath7-bit sequences .",
    "let independent keys @xmath171 , @xmath172 , be the secret keys used for the @xmath173th @xmath7-sequence @xmath174 , each randomly chosen from @xmath175 .",
    "then , by treating each @xmath176 sequence as a single word or symbol , we have created a memoryless channel on the symbols .",
    "this is because both e and b s channel transition probabilities for the different @xmath0 symbols are the same , respectively . as a consequence",
    ", the memoryless coding theorem and its strong converse can be applied to yield the existence proof of a code that generates arbitrarily close to @xmath177 bits .",
    "it should be noted that condition ( [ aad ] ) already includes the cost of the key @xmath14 for net key generation .",
    "if one uses instead the condition @xmath178 together with the net - key generation condition @xmath179 it is more stringent than ( [ aad ] ) from lemma 1 .",
    "if the system is information - theoretic secure against known - plaintext attacks for direct encryption , briefly discussed in section vii and treated extensively in part ii , the keys may be re - used because the different fresh keys generated from two different uses of @xmath5 are independent of each other .",
    "in such a case , only condition ( [ y ] ) without condition ( [ x ] ) needs to be satisfied .",
    "if the @xmath171 are not re - used , a net key generation rate is obtained under ( [ aab ] ) , or ( [ y ] ) and ( [ x ] ) .",
    "more generally , since the above strategy yields a block error rate @xmath180 where @xmath181 is a characteristic of the channel that depends on @xmath7 , and we have @xmath182 even when the error - free data is used as @xmath11 without additional privacy distillation . using lemma 2 , we have also @xmath183 .",
    "to summarize , using also lemma 3 we have    :    under condition ( [ aad ] ) , unconditionally secure protocols may be obtained via error correction coding but without further privacy distillation that satisfy @xmath184 where @xmath185 is determined from the channel specification .    note that a net key @xmath11 can be taken as @xmath8 or its privacy distilled version with @xmath186 guaranteed from ( [ b ] ) only when @xmath187 .",
    "on the other hand , the security level ( [ b ] ) itself may be satisfactory already .",
    "we use the phrase ` unconditional security ' above in the usual sense , except that the security level is measured by @xmath158 and @xmath102 rather than @xmath125 .",
    "this represents a more efficient approach because , as we have seen in iii.c , a bound on @xmath158 has to be imposed in any case .",
    "as in all the unconditional security proofs of qkg protocols so far presented in the literature , the above development can only yield an existence proof of a secure protocol , because no specific code has been given . for actual application , one would need to provide a specific coding or signaling scheme , in either classical or quantum key generation , and show quantitatively that eve has little knowledge on @xmath11 . while @xmath100 , to be supplemented by e s side information , is a measure on e s information , it is not the most useful quantity to deal with as we have already seen above because e can not encode .",
    "indeed , as discussed in iii.c , it is her error profile on @xmath11 obtained from @xmath67 , not just @xmath100 , that really matters .",
    "the appropriate measure to this end is her optimum block error probability @xmath188 given her observation and side information . for advantage creation",
    ", one wants to obtain the situation where @xmath189 condition ( [ aae ] ) is equivalent to the above coding - theoretic existence result when one argues , as in ( [ aad ] ) , by coding on the @xmath7-bit symbols . in actual application",
    ", it may well occur that the users work with only a single @xmath7-bit symbol at a time , especially that already corresponds to @xmath7-bit coding .",
    "in such case , ( [ aab ] ) or ( [ aad ] ) can be ignored and ( [ aae ] ) is _ the appropriate condition for advantage creation_. similar to theorem 1 , we obtain via lemma 2 and lemma 3 .    :    for a detection scheme that has @xmath190 while @xmath191 is error - free in the use , an unconditionally secure protocol for the following fixed security level is obtained without further privacy distillation and with a key cost @xmath14 , @xmath192    note that theorem 2 is valid for a single use of the block detection scheme without further coding . as in theorem 1",
    ", the scheme is certainly useful whenever @xmath193 if the resulting security level is satisfactory . to decrease @xmath194 ,",
    "further privacy distillation may be needed , while no guarantee is offered in the theorem that a net key with @xmath195 can be obtained that is larger than @xmath14 . however , in an appropriately designed scheme , it may already happen that @xmath196 with a secure error profile without further privacy distillation .",
    "in such a case , the following bit - error rate condition holds with independent bit errors , @xmath197 see section vi for an example of a specific protocol that displays such behavior under rather general attacks .",
    "condition ( [ aaf ] ) implies ( [ aae ] ) , and can be taken as the advantage creation condition at the bit level that requires no further privacy distillation for generating @xmath11 .",
    "observe that in the security proof of a specific detection / coding scheme , one must be careful to ascertain e s optimum block error by including her adaptive attacks , in particular ones via attacks on the key .",
    "also , for a full security proof one needs to solve the _ novel _ quantum detection problem in which one chooses the optimum quantum measurement in anticipation of making a future decision on the basis of further information not available at the time of quantum measurement .",
    "however , such problems _ also _ occur in the usual qkg protocols even in the context of individual attacks , whenever a specific scheme is employed rather than a mere coding - theoretic existence claim .",
    "they have yet to be dealt with in the literature .      a final _ key verification _",
    "process is needed in kcq protocols as compared to bb84 . in this case",
    ", a or b uses the generated key @xmath198 to encrypt a fixed shared secret bit sequence @xmath199 , which is perhaps the extended output of a fixed known transformation on some separate shorter shared secret key @xmath13 , @xmath200 , and sends it to the other party through reliable communication",
    ". the encryption mechanism for getting @xmath201 via @xmath11 may be the same as fig.2 but used for direct encryption , thus no privacy distillation and key verification would be involved there .",
    "it is also possible to reverse the above roles of @xmath13 and @xmath11 in the verification , making it similar to a message authentication protocol on @xmath11 with a secret key @xmath13 .",
    "when @xmath13 is used as one - time pad to check an openly chosen random unkeyed hashed version of @xmath11 of size @xmath202 , the average probability that two different @xmath11 are mistakenly agreed upon is @xmath203 .",
    "this results from a random coding argument similar to the proof of the shannon channel coding theorem or the privacy distillation code performance theorem in ref .",
    "the standard results on hashing collision @xcite can also be used instead .",
    "if the users believe there is only a small number of errors in @xmath198 , they may try to correct them via open discussion as in some bb84 protocols , via parity check or other methods .",
    "given that a common key @xmath198 is generated between a and b , it can be seen that e s information can not be more than what she can get from one full copy of the quantum ciphertext , which may be granted to her for the purpose of bounding her information .",
    "this is because whatever probe she introduced that may mess up the state b receives , she can not obtain more information than that of a full copy although she may introduce enough errors to make @xmath11 agreement between a and b impossible .",
    "such a mess up , however , is not something a and b could avoid in the presence of even a ` passive ' attacker that takes energy out of the signal by tapping .",
    "thus , there is no loss of generality in not being able to establish a key in the presence of e , so long as the protocol is not sensitive as to be discussed in section iv .",
    "also , e can not correlate her own states and b s states to obtain information , as she does not know @xmath5 and what states to correlate with .",
    "the probability of such successful attack is small exponentially in the number of bits @xmath7 .",
    "thus , perfect forward secrecy of @xmath11 with respect to @xmath5 is obtained , while both intrusion detection and intrusion - level detection are avoided .",
    "given that advantage can be created , it is possible to _ enhance _ it , i.e. , decreasing the attacker s performance for a fixed user performance , by various techniques .",
    "these include first of all _ data bit randomization _",
    "( dbr ) , the use of a randomly chosen open or secret source code that re - arranges the @xmath56 in fig .",
    "2 . secondly , one may employ _ deliberate error randomization _ ( der ) , the addition of error bits to b introduced deliberately by a with a corresponding error correcting mechanism such as a cecc on the quantum states .",
    "thirdly , one may introduce _ chaining _ among the data and keys , i.e. , the use of local feedback to make future transmissions dependent on past ones .",
    "especially when used in conjunction , such techniques could lead to a flattening of e s error profile for any fixed @xmath7 , and hence her trial complexity @xmath102 whether her entropy @xmath204 is affected or not .    in the classical situation",
    "where a fixed amount of missing information represented by @xmath97 can be used to uniquely specify the channel suffered by e as described in iii .",
    "b , all such techniques can not produce @xmath205 more than @xmath99 from lemma 1 .",
    "nevertheless , such technique may still be useful in a given application because @xmath206 may be large or it may be difficult to ascertain exactly . furthermore , this is not the amount needed to be provided as shared secrets between a and b. quantum mechanically , there is no @xmath97 that can restore the data perfectly for e in a kcq protocol .",
    "thus , these techniques could increase the key generation rate beyond the original @xmath166 . in both the classical and quantum cases ,",
    "such possibility arises because the joint probability distribution of the random variables @xmath207 are not specified a priori , but rather subject to the creation of communication lines between ( a , b ) and ( a , e ) in a given communication situation .",
    "another technique for enhancing the advantage may be obtained as follows .",
    "let @xmath208 be the fraction of system splitted off by e and @xmath209 the one remaining for b. this can be easily quantified in qumode system via the signal energy , so that @xmath210 is the total fraction received by b under the line transmittance @xmath211 .",
    "let @xmath212 be the probability that a and b verify that their generated keys agree with a fraction @xmath210 of the signal received by b , and @xmath213 the probability that e correctly obtains the key with her fraction @xmath208 .",
    "the strategy of granting e a copy of the quantum signal to bound her information is equivalent to the condition that e s probability of successful cheating @xmath214 , @xmath215 , is small when a and b proceeds as if e were not interrupting in a kcq protocol described in iii .",
    "f. by making @xmath216 small for @xmath217 , a set threshold , @xmath218 is modified to @xmath219 this represents advantage enhancement since ( [ aag ] ) is smaller than @xmath220 .",
    "two remarks on this technique are in order .",
    "first , under the use of ( [ aag ] ) which is a kind of pre - set automatic intrusion detection , the cryptosystem becomes more sensitive and thus loses some of the robustness characteristics of kcq protocols .",
    "second , this technique may be considered as one of advantage creation , because the user s performance may be correspondingly lowered with the decrease of the attacker s performance .",
    "schematically , a kcq protocol corresponding to the communication situation of fig .",
    "2 may be summarized as follows .",
    "\\(i ) a picks a random bit sequence @xmath56 , encodes and modulates the corresponding @xmath7 qubits or @xmath7 qumodes as in fig .",
    "2 , with a total secret key @xmath221 shared with b.    \\(ii ) from @xmath60 , advantage creation is achieved via the different error performance obtainable by b and e who does and does not know @xmath60 at the time of their quantum measurements .",
    "\\(iii ) advantage enhancement and privacy distillation may be achieved with appropriate system design , deliberate randomization and chaining techniques , so that a substantial net key can be generated on which e has as little information or as large an optimum error probability as desired .",
    "\\(iv ) a and b verify that they agree on a common @xmath11 by using it with the secret key string @xmath13 .",
    "it is important to note the crucial role of the key verification process in the overall protocol .",
    "if e messed up the state b receives , it produces _ no _ effect on the security of the protocol if the key is verified because e _ can not _ in any case have more information on the correctly agreed key than what she can get from one full copy of the quantum signal , exponentially probabilistically .",
    "if the system is designed to be not sensitive to small disturbance , as any practical system must be , it is perfectly fine that the presence of e would disrupt the key generation process so that the key is not verified . on the other hand",
    ", there are problems in qkg protocols with intrusion - level detection not to be elaborated on section iv .",
    "we have explained the above steps that may enhance the advantage and improve the efficiency and security of the protocol .",
    "a full treatment of specific schemes will be given in the following and in part ii . by combing the analysis of sections",
    "ii and iii , we have    :    in the absence of channel noise , the protocol @xmath222 of fig .",
    "1 allows unconditionally secure key generation for any fixed @xmath7-sequence with a security level given in the form ( [ b ] ) without further privacy distillation .",
    "_ proof _ : we have seen in section ii that e s error probability is bounded away from zero for any @xmath7 , while b s is exactly zero , and the key @xmath5 is completely hidden with the quantum ciphertext alone .",
    "thus , the above generic kcq protocol would generate a fresh key . by coding as in theorem 1 , the security level ( [ b ] )",
    "is obtained where @xmath181 depends on the encryption mechanism and the state @xmath57 .",
    "intuitively , one may expect that @xmath223 would remain substantial in @xmath222 even for large @xmath7 , and also that @xmath205 is large .",
    "however , in the absence of either a security proof against known - plaintext attack or a proof that @xmath224 can be made sufficiently small , theorem 3 is not sufficient to guarantee a nonzero net key generation rate that e knows essentially nothing about . on the other hand ,",
    "the bounds on @xmath225 and @xmath102 should be sufficient .",
    "a similar result would hold in the presence of channel noise , but a rigorous proof requires new techniques to be presented in part ii .    more generally , secure protocols can be created by using quantum entanglement as follows . for each @xmath7-bit data sequence @xmath17 , let @xmath44 mutually orthogonal states in @xmath226 be the possible @xmath57 corresponding to different values of @xmath5 , @xmath227 .",
    "each individual state space @xmath228 may be of any dimension . there",
    "exist many such modulation formats where the resulting @xmath229 are not mutually orthogonal for different @xmath17 .",
    "we have    :    in the absence of channel noise , a kcq protocol employing the above state modulation allows unconditionally secure key generation for any fixed @xmath7-sequence with security level given by ( [ b ] ) without further privacy distillation .    :    from lemma 1 , @xmath230 as obtained by optimizing over all e s possible quantum measurements is bound by @xmath231 , obtained by the same measurement . from holevo s inequality @xcite , @xmath232 . from the above modulation format , @xmath233 while @xmath234 .",

    ", the system could be useful for any @xmath235 while the @xmath202 cost is negligible for large @xmath0 , but the net key generation rate is not guaranteed to be nonzero if @xmath236 has to be made extremely small .",
    "note that the possibility of security proof for qkg relies on the claim that all the possible useful actions of e have been exhausted . that this is true in any particular protocol has to be ascertained carefully .",
    "we assert that this is the case for kcq protocols described in this section and section vi , as long as the model is taken to be a valid description of the real situation .",
    "note that although security against attacks on the key is automatic in qk , it is not in a general kcq system . even with key security on quantum ciphertext - only attacks , one needs to consider situations where some knowledge on the data @xmath17 is obtained from a partial attack on @xmath70 , and then an attack on the key @xmath18 is launched with such knowledge , and then on @xmath17 again , etc .",
    "the system is not fully secure unless the key is secure against such ` statistical attack ' .",
    "this problem also occurs in bb84 type qkg when the generated key @xmath11 is used later for direct encryption . even for the one - time pad mode ,",
    "a known - plaintext attack can be launched to learn part of @xmath11 , and knowledge on the rest may be obtained by e from this and her probe information .",
    "these problems will be analyzed in detail in part ii .",
    "unconditional security ( us ) in qkg is usually taken to mean security against all possible attacks allowed by the laws of physics ( and logic ) , at a level that can be made arbitrarily close to perfect .",
    "in particular , it would imply security against an attacker that has unlimited computational power and hence can perform any exhaustive search .",
    "unconditional security must therefore be information - theoretic , not complexity - based , security .",
    "the term has , lately , often been used in a weakened sense , such as ` unconditional security against individual attacks ' .",
    "as long as the security claim is precisely spelled out , the terminology issue is secondary . since the security is only as good as the mathematical model being valid at the time of system use , it is useful to consider various different qualitative degrees of unconditional security , especially in commercial type applications . as a matter of fact , the experimental development of qkg is still struggling within the realm of individual attacks , the justification being that it is physically complex , and currently practically impossible , to launch more general attacks . in this paper , various weaker claims of security are also considered , especially for specific quantifiable protocols .    in the presence of system imperfection including those arising from the source , transmission line , and detector , we separate out e s disturbance and call the rest ` channel noise ' and ` channel loss ' , as is common in communication theory . in a situation intended for cryptographic applications ,",
    "one first determines what this actual _ channel _ including all these imperfections is , as characterized by the channel parameters in a canonical representation with some confidence interval estimates on these parameters . to guarantee security ,",
    "advantage creation is to be obtained under the following advantage creation principle for unconditional security .",
    "all the noise and loss suffered by the users are assumed absent to the attacker , except those arising from a fundamentally inescapable limit or introduced deliberately by the user at the transmitter .",
    "generally , advantage creation is obtained from the difference between @xmath237 , which includes all the channel disturbance not counting e s for kcq schemes and which is obtained from @xmath238 after disturbance by e for bb84 type schemes , and @xmath239 which includes all the irremovable system disturbance to e. there should be a sufficient margin between @xmath240 and @xmath165 of ( [ aad ] ) in a coding based kcq scheme so that the protocol is not sensitive to small fluctuation in channel parameters and small disturbance by e. thus , it is evident that even if one can in principle get @xmath165 close to @xmath240 , @xmath166 determines the levels of channel parameter fluctuation and e s disturbance that can be tolerated for an efficient protocol ( high @xmath241 in section iv ) . what counts as an irremovable disturbance to e is a matter of technology state and reality constraints , as well as fundamental obstacles . for unconditional security , such fundamental obstacles may include the laws of physics , deliberate actions by a at the transmitter , shared secret between a and b , as well as facts of nature as we know them .",
    "only these should be included in the above us advantage creation principle .",
    "for many applications , practical advantage creation such as those obtained from security against individual attacks , may be quite sufficient .",
    "thus , in a weakened form , one may modify the us advantage creation principle by imposing on e whatever constraint that may seem reasonable in a given application .",
    "the performance of a qkg or key generation scheme for useful real - life application is gauged not only by its security level , but also its efficiency in at least two senses to be elaborated in the following .",
    "the security level is most usefully measured in terms of e s error profile on the final key as averaged over the random parameters of the system and minimized over e s possible attacks . since there is generally a trade - off between security and efficiency , raising",
    "the efficiency for a given security level is equivalent to raising the security level for a given efficiency . in addition , for a protocol to be useful the efficiencies can not be too low .",
    "the first type of efficiency that should be considered is _ protocol efficiency _ , denoted by @xmath241 , which has not been treated in the qkg literature .",
    "it can be defined as the probability that the protocol is not aborted for a given channel and a fixed security level in the absence of an attacker e. it is essential to consider the robustness of @xmath241 with respect to channel parameter fluctuation , e.g. , how _ sensitive _ @xmath241 is to small changes in channel parameter @xmath242 which may denote , e.g. , the independent qubit noise rate of any kind . in practice",
    ", @xmath242 is known only approximately for a variety of reasons , and imperfection in the system can never be entirely eliminated .",
    "if @xmath241 is sensitive to such small changes , the protocol may be practically useless as it may be aborted almost all the time .",
    "sensitivity issues are crucial in engineering design , and there are examples of ` supersensitive ' ideal system whose performance drops dramatically in the presence of small imperfection .",
    "classical examples include detection in nonwhite gaussian noise @xcite and image resolution beyond the diffraction limit @xcite .",
    "superposition of ` macroscopic ' quantum states is supersensitive to loss @xcite .",
    "this crucial sensitivity issue is one of fundamental principle , not mere state of technology .",
    "it has thus far received little attention in the field of quantum information .    as will be shown in sections v  vii , our qumode kcq",
    "key generation protocols are robust to channel parameter fluctuations . on the other hand ,",
    "the lo - chau protocol @xcite is supersensitive at high security level .",
    "this is because any amount of residue noise in the system would be mistaken as e s action in the parity - check hashing , and the protocol would be aborted according to its prescription .",
    "the situation is particularly severe in view of our discussion in iii.c concerning e s ability to use her information .",
    "the reverse reconciliation protocol in ref .",
    "@xcite , which supposedly can operate in any loss , is supersensitive in high loss .",
    "let @xmath211 be the transmittance so that @xmath243 corresponds to the high loss situation . in the presence of a small additive noise of @xmath244 photons in the system ,",
    "the protocol becomes completely useless because the noise induced by the attacker can not be distinguished from excess noise .",
    "apparently , the modified lo - chau or shor - preskill type protocols can be operated without such supersensitivity .",
    "note that high security level often decreases @xmath241 and it is important to quantify the tradeoff .",
    "even when the scheme is not supersensitive , the sensitivity level has to quantified in a qkg scheme involving intrusion - level detection for a complete protocol with quantifiable security , for the following reason that has _ not _ been discussed in the literature .",
    "the security proofs of such a scheme always has a conclusion of the following form : if e has information @xmath245 on @xmath11 from any attack @xmath246 , then the probability that @xmath246 would pass the test is @xmath247 for small @xmath248 and @xmath249 .",
    "this may be put in form of a conditional probability statement @xmath250 however , the reverse conditional probability statement is required for a real security proof : @xmath251 it is easy to see that @xmath252 can be large under ( [ w ] ) , say if e keeps attacking with @xmath246 that yields significant @xmath253 . for example , in standard bb84 , e can learn each bit with probability @xmath254 in an opaque attack .",
    "this shows that the users must employ a ` stopping strategy ' in a complete protocol , by adopting a stopping rule which stops the whole process after a number of test results that lead to aborting the protocol , and another rule to re - start the process . to evaluate ( [ v ] )",
    ", one would need @xmath255 in addition to ( [ w ] ) which would involve in turn @xmath256 this probability ( [ u ] ) depends on the quantitative sensitivity level just discussed , corresponding to the case of no attack or @xmath257 .",
    "in addition , e s optimal attack on the sequence of key generation trials depends on the user s stopping and re - starting strategy , and it appears one can not bound the overall @xmath258 before such a strategy is spelled out .",
    "it should be clear that much remains to be done to obtain quantitative results on the overall protocol security and efficiency . in this connection",
    ", it may also be observed that in all security proofs involving the use of an error correcting code , it was not shown that an efficient ( non - exponential ) decoding algorithm exists .",
    "thus , on many levels it has _ not _ been demonstrated that an efficient protocol exists with quantifiable security levels even for standard bb84 . on the other hand",
    ", these problems do not arise in specific kcq schemes .",
    "after the protocol goes forward , there is clearly the question of key - bit generation efficiency ( or rate ) @xmath12 which may be defined via the number of generated key bits subtracted by the number of key bits used in the protocol , i.e. , @xmath259 when an @xmath7-bit data sequence was used to obtain @xmath11 with a total key @xmath221 that is not re - used .",
    "this should be distinguished from the final effective key generation rate @xmath260 , which includes all the operations in the protocol to give the actual speed of key generation , a subject not discussed in this paper .",
    "when the modulation key @xmath171 with @xmath261 is not re - used in the coded system of section iii.4 in an @xmath0-block of @xmath7-bit symbols , @xmath262 where @xmath125 is e s information rate that needs to be eliminated . if the protocol is secure under known - plaintext attacks , the @xmath263 term can be omitted .",
    "the @xmath125 term may be omitted if the coding scheme automatically forces @xmath264 to be negligible .",
    "in this section we describe the use of kcq on qumodes , quantum modes with infinite - dimensional hilbert state spaces , for key generation via coherent states of intermediate or large energy . in most of the current experimental developments",
    "@xcite of qkg , coherent states are employed in bb84 type protocols that are limited in energy to @xmath265 photon , if only because of the photon - number splitting attack that e can launch near the transmitter @xcite . with kcq",
    ", we will in this and the next section show that much larger energy can be employed , line amplifiers and pre - amplifiers can be used , and conventional optical technology on the sources , modulators , and detectors can be utilized .",
    "furthermore , direct encryption coherent - state kcq in what is called the @xmath1 scheme has already been experimentally observed @xcite , which will integrate smoothly with the corresponding key generation schemes that are currently under experimental development .",
    "the usual description of a single coherent state already involves an infinite dimensional space , referred to as a _",
    "qumode_. similar to the qubit case in fig . 1",
    ", we may consider @xmath2 possible coherent states @xmath266 in a single - mode realization , @xmath267,\\ ] ] where @xmath268 is the energy ( photon number ) in the state , and @xmath269 is the angle between two neighboring states . in a two - mode realization ,",
    "the states are products of two coherent states @xmath270 the qumodes may be those associated with polarization , time , frequency , or any type of classical mode .",
    "any two basis states form a phase reversal keying ( antipodal ) signal set , which are nearly orthogonal for @xmath271 . the optimal quantum phase measurement @xcite yields a root - mean - square phase error @xmath272 . thus , when @xmath273 , the probability of error @xmath274 when the basis is not known which has been confirmed numerically [ 13 ] , while @xmath275 when the basis is known .",
    "this scheme can be used for key generation as follows .",
    "an attacker not knowing the key @xmath5 has to make a measurement to cover all possible angles for different possible @xmath6 in her effort to pin down the data @xmath15 . from such measurement result , she can then try to determine all the possible @xmath17 corresponding to the different possible @xmath19 . for each running key @xmath19 from her trial key @xmath18 that selects a particular basis for a particular bit , e has a classical binary decision problem for two , not @xmath0 , possible signal points .",
    "the more practical heterodyne measurement , which may be forced on the attacker with a signal set of varying amplitudes in addition to the varying phase of @xmath1 , is @xmath276 db worse in energy than the optimal measurement @xcite .",
    "the optimal phase measurement , which has no known physical realization , is worse than the optimal quantum measurement of antipodal signals by @xmath277 db in signal energy a detailed binary - decision numerical evaluation on this performance is under way , but the @xmath278 db estimate follows from the amplitude / phase and conjugate quadratures ( heterodyne / homodyne ) analogy , and is supported by known results @xcite . in any event , the precise number is important in an actual design of real system and in bringing out the intrinsic limitation of the system , but is not as important for illustrating the possibility and basic principle involved . in this case",
    ", the principle is that there is a substantial difference in performance due to a _ quantum effect _ that has no classical analog , viz , different incompatible quantum measurements versus a single complete measurement in the classical case .",
    "more precisely , for discrimination of two equally likely coherent states @xmath279 , the optimum quantum receiver yields an error rate @xmath280 that may be compared to the heterodyne result @xmath281 and the phase measurement result @xmath282 , with @xmath283 , @xmath284 here , @xmath285 measures the average number of photons received in the detector and ( [ c ] ) applies in the so - called quantum - limited detection regime unity detector quantum efficiency , infinite detector bandwith , all device noise suppressed . under ( [ c ] ) and",
    "dropping the factors in front of the exponentials for a numerical estimate of the bit - error rate ( ber ) , which is required to be @xmath286 per use in a typical communication application , we have , for a mesoscopic level @xmath287 .",
    "if the data arrives at a rate of @xmath22 gbps , the user b is likely to have @xmath288 error - free bits in @xmath22 sec , while e would have @xmath289 errors among her @xmath288 bits with the optimum phase measurement . by the usual privacy distillation approach @xcite , the users can generate @xmath290 secure key bits by eliminating e s information .",
    "thus , in principle , @xmath1 in its original form is capable of secure key generation against individual attacks that employs the optimal phase measurement on each qumode .",
    "similar to _ all _ cases of specific qkg schemes to date , that there is no full security proof against even constant individual attacks in contrast to the claim of unconditional security in existence proofs , the above analysis does not prove there is no other individual or collective measurement , particularly adaptive ones utilizing the seed key information , that would yield a substantially better ber for e than the optimal phase measurement .",
    "intuitively , we feel that is quite unlikely , but new techniques in classical and quantum detection theory are being developed to give precise quantitative treatment on such problems .",
    "note that whatever the final result may turn out to be , it only affects the quantitative advantage level but not the possibility of advantage creation . in this connection , we may mention that @xmath1 in its original form was proposed for key generation in ref .",
    "@xcite , with no consideration of information - theoretic key security against meaningful attacks . in the way @xmath1 was run ,",
    "actually no fresh key can be generated because @xmath281 in ( [ c ] ) is very small .",
    "more serious limitations on the use of @xmath1 for key generation , i believe , arise from the us advantage creation principle when the above scheme is to be utilized in practice . in the first place ,",
    "device thermal noise is significant at high data rate and small signals , thus optical pre - amplifiers need to be used . for the usual erbium amplifier",
    "this would already take out the advantage over e. on this issue , it may be pointed out that the optimum binary quantum receiver has not been implemented so far in @xmath1 , but the near - optimum kennedy receiver @xcite , with @xmath291 is currently under development . ( the factor @xmath292 difference between @xmath280 and @xmath293",
    "can be recovered in a dolinar receiver described in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is the first systematic investigation of optical receiver performance improvement via feedback . ) on the other hand , the photon number amplifier ( pna ) @xcite could lead to an ideal kennedy receiver in principle although pna is far from practical at present .",
    "secondly , in the presence of a line loss @xmath211 from a to b , one would need to compare @xmath294 to @xmath295 according to the advantage creation principle when e attacks near a. even if one uses the advantage creation technique of accounting for e s energy splitting described in iii.g , and the postdetection selection technique of ref .",
    "@xcite , in conjunction it appears difficult to create an advantage over e that would allow key generation over truly long - distance telecomm fibers .",
    "thus , a more powerful approach via @xmath0-ary detection is developed in the following .",
    "before we turn to this advantage creation technique , it is useful to introduce a number of other techniques that may improve the security and efficiency of kcq schemes , and to demonstrate a general limitation on the binary detection approach to coherent - state kcq for key generation .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath1 represents a new type of cipher even when it is operated in a completely classical setting , and even in the absence of any channel noise .",
    "this is because deliberate randomization may be introduced by a in many ways .",
    "consider the situation where the circle of fig.1 represents a classical two - dimensional signal space , say corresponding to the two quadratures of a single frequency . in the absence of any noise",
    ", the circle would represent the different possible phase - shifted signals of a given energy .",
    "thus , the cryptosystem can be run in the same way as @xmath1 with or without classical noise , in hardware and even in software .",
    "indeed , in the direct encryption experiments on @xmath1 reported thus far @xcite , the performance obtained via the coherent - state quantum noise can also be achieved by high - speed deliberate partial randomization of the signals by a corresponding to the coherent - state noise effect .",
    "when @xmath1 is used for key generation , one may employ the technique of _ deliberate signal randomization _ ( dsr ) for which each signal state at the output of the encryption box of fig .",
    "1 is further randomized so that it is uniformly distributed on the semi - circle centered at the state chosen by the running key @xmath6 .",
    "similar to the qubit case , one may readily show the intuitively obvious fact that the key @xmath5 is completely hidden form e who does not know @xmath5 and @xmath15 , even if she possesses one copy of @xmath57 corresponding to an arbitrarily long data sequence @xmath17 .",
    "the general interwined case described in section iii will be treated in part ii , as it involves security against known - plaintext attack on direct encryption .",
    "this is true classically also as just discussed . in the presence of quantum or classical noise",
    ", one needs to use a proper randomization if all the error control is built in the antipodal signal set only , as above .",
    "when a cecc is used on top of the antipodal signals , deliberation error randomization can be introduced to improve security / efficiency as described in section iii.g .",
    "in addition to providing complete protection against ciphertext - only attack on the key , dsr also improves the efficiency of key generation .",
    "if the state is rotated by an angle @xmath296 away from the one set by @xmath6 and is unknown to the detector which knows @xmath6 , the optimum phase measurement ber as a function of @xmath296 is yet to be evaluated , but the corresponding kennedy and heterodyne receiver performance are @xmath297 the @xmath298 in ( [ d ] ) is the chernov bound @xcite for the kennedy receiver when @xmath299 , while @xmath300 is the usual upper bound on gaussian errors @xcite .",
    "it is expected that in a more exact evaluation of @xmath298 , the energy advantage is closer to the original @xmath276 db than the @xmath278 db one of ( [ d ] ) , and similarly for @xmath301 .",
    "thus , even for large signal energy , a can control the ber to b and e and causes more errors to e through b s advantage .",
    "in practice , some cecc should be used for reliable system operation , and channel code key @xmath59 , chaining , and other techniques could be used to enhance the advantage already created for efficiency improvement .",
    "with dsr on @xmath1 , one may obtain secure key generation against constant individual attacks as follows .",
    "let the angle @xmath296 be randomized so that it appears uniform over the whole circle with respect to e s optimum ( phase ) constant qumode measurement .",
    "in this way , the key @xmath5 is completely hidden even in a known - plaintext attack , in a way exactly similar to the classical noiseless case where a semicircle is sufficient to protect against ciphertext - only attacks .",
    "if the signal strength @xmath285 is not large enough , this would also introduce error to b. however , a cecc can be designed to correct only up to the ber b then suffers , which is smaller than that of e due to b s error performance advantage . by using theorem 1 , one may generate fresh keys , with no cost for each @xmath7-bit symbol due to security against known - plaintext attacks .",
    "we summarize    :    with proper use of dsr just described , a coded @xmath1 scheme leads to unconditionally secure net key generation against constant individual attacks with security level given by ( [ b ] ) .    again ,",
    "with the development of proper bounding techniques , we believe the restriction to constant individual attacks in theorem 5 can be simply removed .",
    "the detailed quantitative dependence of the security level as a function of @xmath285 and other system parameters will be given for both individual and joint attacks in the future .",
    "for binary coherent - state signals , the optimal quantum receiver performance can not be better than that of heterodyne by @xmath276 db in energy or error exponent . this is a known fact among all the usual binary coherent state systems , but there is no general proof in the literature",
    ". a proof can be supplied , which is not difficult , but is omitted here for brevity .",
    "also , it may be proved that antipodal signals lead to optimal ber under energy constraint on coherent states .",
    "furthermore , it is not possible to increase the error advantage by utilizing bandwidth , or more generally any multimode system , for the following reason .",
    "consider an optical quantum field of arbitrary bandwidth @xmath302 where @xmath17 is the transverse spatial dimension .",
    "on her copy of the field , whether it is the one she splitted off by tapping or the hypothetical one we grant her for bounding her information , she can always in principle make a heterodyne measurement to obtain the classical readout @xmath303 , which is described by @xcite , @xmath304 where @xmath305 is the amplitude of the coherent - state signal and @xmath306 is an additive gaussian noise in @xmath307 with spectral density @xmath308 at frequency @xmath309 .",
    "all quantum fluctuation in every space - time mode has already been included . in a binary detection system involving two classical signals in additive white gaussian noise ( awgn )",
    ", one can always extract one signal dimension ( one quadrature out of one mode ) that contains all the information for optimal discrimination @xcite .",
    "the whiteness approximation that all @xmath310 , a single frequency , is very good for all practical optical signals .",
    "thus , even though ( [ e ] ) contains many quantum noise photons one from every mode in the optimal receiver only one such mode is to be extracted by appropriate spatial - temporal filtering . as a consequence , we are back to the single - mode situation where there is just one noise photon from heterodyne . indeed , heterodyne is a ` universal ' measurement whose result captures all aspects of the field mode : amplitude , phase , quadratures , etc .",
    ", that allows e to try all possible @xmath5 to identify all possible data .",
    "one may understand this result from the important fact that a multimode coherent - state excited field from vacuum is equivalent to a single - mode coherent - state excited field .",
    "the result just quoted is not true for _ nonclassical light _ ,",
    "i.e. , optical fields in quantum states that is not classical , not a coherent state or a classically random superposition of coherent states .",
    "clearly , there can be huge improvement between the optimal and heterodyne detection of a nonclassical state . for number states , ideal photon counting yields @xmath311 for on - off signals . for squeezed states ,",
    "homodyne detection along the maximum squeezing direction sees the minimum noise as compared to one that may see a large noise without knowledge of that direction .",
    "thus , by using @xmath5 to determine such directions , the users would obtain huge error advantage over e even in a binary detection system .",
    "one can similarly use number states and other orthogonal states in conjunction with coherent states to create other binary systems that give arbitrarily small ber for b but large ones for e.    we would not go into the details for such development because intermediate or large - energy nonclassical states do not have much practical significance as data source in long - distance communication @xcite .",
    "this is because the inevitable system imperfection , especially linear loss , would quickly transform such nonclassical states into classical ones . as a consequence ,",
    "the initial energy or error advantage disappears quickly over a lossy communication line . for realistic application of mesoscopic or macroscopic energy signals",
    ", we may want to limit ourselves to coherent states .",
    "the above limitation on the binary detection advantage of an optimal quantum receiver versus heterodyne can be overcome in @xmath0-ary detection .",
    "the use of @xmath0-ary systems , in fact , is one form of coding .",
    "as will be seen in the following , it indeed corresponds to driving the system at a rate between b s and e s mutual information with respect to a as in ( [ aad ] ) .",
    "amazingly , for the particular cppm system we now turn , such a rate choice by a automatically makes @xmath125 go to zero with a flat error profile , with also full information - theoretic security against known plaintext attack on the key .",
    "this is proved against the universal heterodyne attack , and is likely to be true against all possible attacks .",
    "thus , not only the data enjoy unconditional security at the near perfect level , the key has security that has never even been suggested possible before in either standard or quantum cryptography .",
    "an @xmath0-ary coherent - state pulse position modulation system has the following signal set for @xmath0 possible messages , @xmath312 in ( [ h ] ) , each @xmath313 is in @xmath0 qumodes all of which are in the vacuum state except the @xmath173th mode , which is in a coherent state @xmath314 .",

    "the states @xmath337 of ( [ k ] ) are used to modulate the data @xmath173 by a , and b demodulates by first applying @xmath330 to transform it to @xmath338 of ( [ h ] ) and then use direct detection on each of the @xmath0 modes @xmath228 .    without knowing @xmath330 or @xmath332 so that there are both amplitude and phase uncertainties for each @xmath55 , it is expected that an attacker can do very little better than heterodyne on all the @xmath339 modes , which is equivalent to heterodyne on all the @xmath228 modes , and then apply the different @xmath330 s on the classical measurement result ( [ e ] ) . as presented above , by making @xmath0 large one can then make not only @xmath340 for any @xmath55 but e s error profile is in fact nearly uniform , with @xmath341 for @xmath342 , thus no need for further privacy distillation . as a consequence ,",
    "the system is not only completely secure against ciphertext - only attack on the key but also fully secure against known - plaintext attacks .",
    "this is because given an input - output pair @xmath343 , the heterodyne output @xmath67 has no relation to @xmath8 for any @xmath18 from e s uniform error profile .",
    "the exact quantitative behavior may be bounded via ( [ j ] ) .",
    "we summarize :    against e s universal heterodyne attack , the @xmath0-ary cppm kcq protocol is unconditionally secure with asymptotic key generation rate @xmath318 per use and @xmath158 , @xmath125 going to zero exponentially in @xmath7 .    the only easy way to remove the restriction to heterodyning for e is to note that the optimum quantum receiver for discrimination among the states ( [ h ] ) is unique @xcite .",
    "thus , there is a gap between it and the receiver performance that does not know @xmath5 at the time of quantum measurement , which translates into a mutual information statement ( [ aad ] ) that can be used to show the existence of codes upon further coding , as described in iii.e , that yields security in the sense of theorem 1 .",
    "although this does not seem to give useful practical protocol for actual implementation and does not guarantee key bit generation , it is of interest in principle to record the following .    :    against any attack by eve , the cppm scheme may be further coded to provide unconditional security with levels given by ( [ b ] ) .",
    "the direct detection or optimal detection performance ( [ i ] ) is affected by the presence of device noise so that there is no more vacuum state in ( [ h ] ) .",
    "however , ordinary pre - amplifier could be used that suppresses all the device noise with a resulting performance degradation that amounts to a less factor @xmath344 in @xmath0-ary ppm .",
    "furthermore , in principle a photon - number amplifier mentioned in vi.a can be used as a noiseless pre - amplifier .",
    "quantitative evaluations of the resulting performance are , however , yet to be carried out .",
    "one major advantage of coherent - state kcq scheme is that they can be used through a limited number of amplifiers and switching nodes in a properly designed system with appropriate amplifiers . in general , quantum amplifiers",
    "degrade the user s error performance due to the fundamental quantum noise they introduce @xcite . in a properly designed chain with appropriately chosen amplifier gains and lengths of lossy line segments ,",
    "one can obtain a linear @xcite instead of an exponential degradation in the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) as a function of total line length .",
    "there is no need to decrypt and re - encrypt at the input of an amplifier as in a repeater , as long as the degradation introduced by the amplifier still leaves b with performance advantage over e. recall the overall general advantage creation principle for key generation that b must have performance advantage on the decoded information - bit sequence after all system imperfections including loss and noise are taken into account , as compared to e s decoded information - bit sequence for no loss and no imperfection other than unavoidable ones . in the case of cppm , b s performance would be scaled by the total transmittance @xmath211 so that @xmath285 is replaced by @xmath345 in ( [ i ] ) . in principle , it is still a better performance compared to ( [ j ] ) with @xmath346 for large enough @xmath0 .",
    "thus , cppm can be secure for arbitrarily long - distance fiber communication .",
    "it may be mentioned that the possible use of amplifier in a quantum cryptosystem has been introduced previously for weak coherent states and heterodyne / homodyne detection @xcite that traces back to ref .",
    "@xcite that describes both coherent - state and squeezed - state cryptosystems .",
    "in particular , the usual - state scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite employs conjugate - variable measurement detection of intrusion level similar to the schemes of ref .",
    "@xcite , while also allowing a limited use of amplifiers as described .",
    "however , all such schemes are inefficient because weak or small energy signals have to be used to avoid good performance in determining the actual signal state via optimal quantum detection by e , and via attacks similar to the usd attack on coherent - state realization of bb84 type systems @xcite .",
    "the cppm scheme is also ideal for direct data encryption because it automatically produces a near uniform error profile on e corresponding to near - perfect bit - by - bit security .",
    "indeed , from the constant inner product @xmath347 for every @xmath348 which is the quantum analog of the classical orthogonal or simplex signal behavior that is responsible for their near uniform error profile in awgn , it would be possible to prove that such a property persists under e s optimal attack .",
    "it would then appear that all problems are solved in principle as arbitrarily large error exponent advantage can be obtained between ( [ i ] ) and ( [ j ] ) by making @xmath0 large .    unfortunately , as in a classical orthogonal signaling scheme , large @xmath0 in cppm means exponential growth of bandwidth , not to mention growth in physical complexity .",
    "indeed , ( [ i ] ) itself is an infinite - bandwidth result for large @xmath0 .",
    "one the other hand , it is known @xcite that if the signal - to - quantum noise per unit bandwidth is small , coherent - state direct detection systems do have larger capacity than heterodyne ones .",
    "thus , it may be expected that properly designed error correcting codes , usually employed for bandlimited systems for such reasons , could be developed to retain much of the cppm advantage for a large given bandwidth .",
    "for direct encryption , one needs to consider ciphertext - only attack on the key , on the data , and known - plaintext attack on the key . in conventional cryptography",
    "one has the shannon bound , @xmath349 , on the conditional entropy of the data @xmath15 given the ciphertext @xmath350 via the key entropy . in the quantum case or in the presence of irreducible classical noise to e , the corresponding bound @xmath351 is no longer valid where @xmath78 is the classical ciphertext available to e. in the quantum case , @xmath78 is obtained via a quantum measurement .",
    "if ( [ n ] ) is valid as is the case in conventional cryptography , it does not mean that e knows all the bits in @xmath15 except for @xmath14 of them .",
    "that would be disastrous as it often happens that @xmath352 while @xmath353 .",
    "the operational meaning of ( [ n ] ) has never been analyzed in conventional cryptography , to my knowledge .",
    "it is usually not considered a problem because it is presumed that e would get many information bits in @xmath15 wrong knowing only @xmath350 and not @xmath5 . however , a more detailed analysis is needed for a security proof with respect to whatever chosen criteria , as we have done for key generation in section iii.c .",
    "but that has never been provided in conventional cryptography other than the trivial one - time pad case .",
    "when ( [ n ] ) is violated , lemma 1 implies @xmath354 , a condition that allows key generation via ( [ aab ] ) as in theorem 1 . for direct encryption ,",
    "such violation has the _ important _ implication that very high level of data - bit security may be obtained _ without _ using the inefficient one - time pad .",
    "indeed , we have seen how this may occur in cppm treated in section vi .",
    "note that theorems 1 and 2 can also be used to describe the data quality in direct encryption .",
    "it is easy to protect @xmath5 from ciphertext - only joint attacks in @xmath1 with the use of , e.g. , dsr , discussed in section v.a .",
    "the technique can be extended to cover known - plaintext attacks in two different ways , to be presented in part ii . without dsr ,",
    "the bound ( [ n ] ) obtains with @xmath355 on the right - hand side .",
    "the usual security problem is known - plaintext attack , in which e tries to determine @xmath5 from data - output sequence pairs with statistical correlation information on the data ( of varying degree ) .",
    "security against known - plaintext attacks is always at best computational complexity - based against exponential search in conventional cryptography . for noisy system , we suggest that it is possible to have information - theoretic security , i.e. , @xmath356 which has never been suggested before and is clearly impossible in conventional cryptography where @xmath357 .",
    "full security would correspond to @xmath358 , which again can be closely approximated in cppm systems , at least for the universal heterodyne attack .",
    "even when @xmath359 as is the case in conventional cryptography for sufficiently long @xmath15 , the system may be secure in the sense of high search complexity .",
    "in particular , @xmath360 in the original form without dsr provides an additional search problem to e , as compared to just the encryption box , that is exponential in @xmath361 , at least for brute - force search . for increasing the search complexity",
    ", one may make sure the input data can never be perfectly known in several ways .",
    "one is to use polarity or padding bits as described in section ii .",
    "another is to generate the polarity bits through a running key obtained from another encryption mechanism with the same @xmath5 or another different key as the seed key .",
    "note that the proper use of dsr would introduce inevitable coherent - state quantum noise for e , which may even lead to information - theoretic security already if the energy in the coherent state is not too large .",
    "no proof of any cryptosystem has ever been given in conventional cryptography , to my knowledge , that establishes rigorous exponential lower bound on the search complexity .",
    "and we have not ( yet ) succeeded in proving that @xmath362 necessitates an exponential search either - it is just an added search burden as compared to just the encryption box and appears exponential . in general ,",
    "such multi - variable correlated classical statistical problem has the full mathematical complexity of many - body problems and quantum field theory in physics .",
    "useful lower bound is also notoriously difficult to obtain in computation problems .",
    "perhaps these explain why no rigorous security proof is available on such complexity - based security .    on the other hand",
    ", exponential search complexity should be good enough for any application .",
    "we have mentioned in section ii that grover s search only reduces the exponent by a factor of two , which is easily compensated by increasing the key size by a factor of two in many standard schemes as well as in our kcq schemes , either qubit or coherent - state .    as noted previously in this paper , data security against attacks on the key with statistical knowledge on data that are not completely random",
    "is required for a complete proof of key generation security with kcq .",
    "an extensive general theoretical development of direct encryption security analysis will be provided in part ii , where conditional probabilities will be used in addition to entropies for more precise quantitative estimate of specific coding / detection scheme performance .",
    "the behaviors of @xmath1 , cppm , and their refinement and extension will be developed for concrete cryptosystem design .",
    "we present below a brief qualitative comparison between qkg schemes of the bb84 type , of the qubit kcq type , and the coherent - state kcq type .",
    "detailed quantitative comparisons will be given after rigorous evaluation of the quantitative characteristics of these schemes for finite @xmath7 .",
    "theoretically , bb84 type protocols suffer from the following classes of problems as a matter of fundamental principle .",
    "\\(i ) it is hard to bound eve s error rate on the key generated due to the difficulties of intrusion - level estimation under joint attacks with side information on the error correcting and privacy distillation codes .",
    "\\(ii ) it is difficult to produce a complete protocol that can be practically implemented with quantifiable security and efficiency , due to the decoding problem and the stopping - rule problem .",
    "\\(iii ) it is hard to include the various system imperfections in an unconditional security proof , and to build protocols robust with respect to fluctuations in the magnitude of these imperfections .",
    "\\(iv ) the necessary use of weak signals and the difficulty of repeating the signal without decryption imply low throughput even with just moderate loss .",
    "\\(v ) the intrinsic small quantum effect of a single photon necessitates an accurate sensitivity analysis with respect to the system imperfection and environmental perturbations , that would result in a low interference tolerance threshold in commercial applications .",
    "corresponding to these problems are related practical one including    ( i@xmath363 ) it is difficult or impossible to rigorously ascertain the quantitative security level of the generated key .",
    "( ii@xmath363 ) the throughput or key - generation rate would be low , especially in the presence of substantial loss .",
    "( iii@xmath363 ) the cryptosystem is sensitive to interference , and needs to be controlled and checked with a high precision difficult to achieve practically .",
    "( iv@xmath363 ) high - precision components corresponding to a fundamentally new technology are required , including the source , transmission line or repeater , and detector .    with the exception of ( i ) and ( ii ) , which are further discussed in appendix a ,",
    "all these problems are evident and well known in bb84 although there are disagreements on how readily they can be overcome .",
    "nevertheless , in the foreseeable future it seems clear that bb84 type schemes can not be made to operate in a commercial type environment with any reasonable level of security and efficiency for even moderately long distance .",
    "the weak coherent - state schemes of ref .",
    "@xcite also suffer from all these problems except ( iv@xmath364 ) , and that of ref .",
    "@xcite is only slightly better .    with the use of qubit kcq type schemes , the theoretical problems in ( i ) and ( ii )",
    "can be largely overcome , but not the ones in ( iii ) and ( iv ) except perhaps with very low key - bit generation efficiency . except for ( i@xmath363 ) , the practical difficulties ( ii@xmath363)-(iv@xmath363 )",
    "also remain .",
    "again , it may be possible to alleviate these problems with strong error correction that implies a low @xmath12 .    with the use of the qumode kcq schemes of intermediate to large energy , all the fundamental difficulties ( i)-(iv ) can be substantially reduced .",
    "furthermore , each of the practical difficulties ( i@xmath363)-(iv@xmath363 ) either disappears or is substantially alleviated .",
    "the exception is loss in long - distance fiber communication . in principle , a wideband coherent cppm system presented in section vi could solve all problems . for practical application , new approaches are needed to deal with bandwidth limitation and coherence requirements .",
    "it is still a major problem to create enough advantage for unconditional information - theoretic security .",
    "a new principle of quantum cryptography has been presented on the basis of optimal versus nonoptimal quantum detection when a seed key is known or not known . this possibility of yielding better performance for the users over an attacker is a quantum effect with no classical analog . in classical physics , a complete observation of the physical signal state can be made with or without the key .",
    "it would be misleading to phrase the basis of this possibility as no - cloning , which is trivially covered @xcite by quantum detection theory that provides detailed quantitative limits on quantum state discrimination from the laws of quantum physics .",
    "a detailed development of the appropriate novel quantum detection theory wil be given in the future for a complete quantitative assessment of cryptosystem efficiency and security .",
    "this will be done especially in terms of eve s optimal probability of guessing the generated key correctly , which is a more appropriate criterion than her mutual information .",
    "a powerful new kcq protocol cppm that utilizes @xmath0-ary instead of binary detection has been presented that could , in principle , lead to secure key generation and data encryption over long - distance telecomm fibers .",
    "however , the problem of obtaining such a protocol under bandwidth and practical constraints remains both a theoretical and experimental challenge .",

    "this work was supported by the defense advanced research project agency under grant f30602 - 01 - 2 - 0528 .",
    "in the qkg literature , there are different types of security proofs that purport to show the existence of unconditionally secure protocols against any attack allowed by the laws of physics , while new proofs are continually emerging that we have not scrutinized .",
    "they are the proofs of shor - preskill @xcite , lo - chau @xcite , mayers @xcite , biham etc . @xcite and recently a more complete approach by hamada @xcite .",
    "i believe that all of them have serious gaps that are difficult to close .",
    "the situation is rather confusing because the strategies of these proofs are different , and problems in one type may not arise in another . in the following , three major problems in these proofs",
    "are briefly described , at least one of them applies to any of the above proofs .",
    "in addition , three other problems in a complete protocol are briefly indicated , none of which has been addressed in the literature , to my knowledge ..    the three major problems in these proofs are    \\(i ) it is hard to rigorously and accurately estimate e s disturbance on the qubits under a joint attack .",
    "\\(ii ) it is difficult to show there exists a universal error correcting code that would produce the desired security level for all attacks that pass the intrusion - level test in the protocol with significant probability .",
    "\\(iii ) the side information that e has from the public knowledge has not been properly taken into account in the estimate of her information on the key generated .    from an information - theoretic viewpoint , a joint attack from e",
    "creates in general a quantum channel with entanglement on the user s qubits .",
    "it seems impossible to obtain a good estimate of e s disturbance from merely one copy of the general channel .",
    "this difficulty , which may be called the _ inference problem _ , also affects the existence and the choice of a code that would perform satisfactorily under all possible attacks that do not lead to the protocol being aborted , as expressed in ( ii ) above .",
    "indeed , even for constant individual attacks this _ coding problem _ has only recently been rigorously dealt with in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when it applies , the inference problem is serious and does not seem to have a solution even in the asymptotic limit @xmath365 .",
    "it seems to be handled in ref .",
    "@xcite by the argument of quantum to classical reduction adopted from ref .",
    "however , the local measurement actually performed by the users is _ not _ equivalent to the nonlocal degenerate bell measurement needed for the reduction to go through , with respect to the determination of the state after the measurement that is needed in the next step of the proof .",
    "they are only equivalent , in both the cases of ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , with respect to the probabilities that govern the use of the measurement results .",
    "perhaps the equivalence claim arose from interpreting the description of a measurement by the same @xmath366 differently in two different contexts @xcite .",
    "when @xmath366 has a degenerate spectrum , the measurement as specified by a pom is not uniquely represented by the symbol @xmath366 .",
    "furthermore , the inference of the test qubit results to the information qubits left can not be justified by the quantum de finetti theorem @xcite because quantum entanglement leads to violation of the exchangeability premise of the theorem , and quantum entanglement is precisely what a joint attack can yield that an individual attack can not .",
    "however , the inference problem does not arise in proofs where b makes measurements on all received qubits before proceeding .",
    "the problem of such proofs is how one may bound eve s information under her optimal attack .",
    "note that a security proof needs to answer this question for the user : given that a key @xmath11 is obtained by following the protocol on @xmath7 qubits , what one can rigorously say about the error profile or information that e has on @xmath11 as optimized over all her possible attacks .",
    "this question is especially serious for the realistic case when the statistical fluctuation due to a finite @xmath7 needs to be under control .",
    "it appears that new techniques need to be developed to handle such problem in this type of protocols with intrusion - level detection .",
    "even asymptotically , the _ coding problem _ remains on what scheme one should employ that guarantees a bound on eve s information when she optimizes her probe / interation _ in anticipation _ that she would receive side information later before she makes her measurement .",
    "this problem is coupled with the following side information problem , although the latter constitutes a problem al by itself .    in terms of our notation ,",
    "the _ side information problem _ can be simply stated as follows .",
    "let @xmath285 be e s side information before she made her final measurement and estimate of the generated key @xmath11 from an observation on her ancilla .",
    "then eve s mutual information on @xmath11 is given by @xmath367 . from ( [ z ] ) , this is equal to @xmath368 .",
    "most treatments just bound @xmath369 . in @xcite , the ( smaller ) @xmath370 is bounded but @xmath371 is ignored .",
    "however , @xmath371 may grow with the number of qubits @xmath7 in @xmath17 and has to be subtracted from @xmath11 to show that a net positive key generation rate is in fact obtained . in this regard",
    ", we may recall that the fundamental superiority of quantum over standard cryptography is based almost exclusively on the availability of rigorous proofs rather than mere plausible assumptions , qualitative arguments and numerical simulations .",
    "the three problems that need to be dealt with in a complete protocol that be be practically implemented with quantifiable security are    \\(1 ) the efficient code problem :    one needs to show there is a polynomial - time algorithm for decoding whatever code that is utilized in the security proof . if a non - optimal efficient algorithm is used , its effect on security needs to be quantified . in this connection",
    ", it may be observed that there is no rigorous quantitative bounds on the efficiency and security levels of the cascade protocol @xcite widely used in experimental implementations .",
    "\\(2 ) the stoping rule problem :    as discussed in section iv , to obtain @xmath372 that provides quantitative security guarantee of the protocol , one needs an explicit stopping/ re - starting strategy .",
    "then one needs to bound eve s optimal attack performance with respect to such a strategy from an appropriate overall criterion .",
    "\\(3 ) the future key use problem :    when the generated key @xmath11 is used as one - time pad or as a seed key in a conventional cipher , a known - plaintext attack on part of @xmath11 can be combined with eve s original probe / measurement to tell something about the rest of the key .",
    "this problem arises also in the kcq approach , and shows the crucial importance of the direct encryption known - plaintext attack problem in using keys obtained form a key - generation protocol .",
    "there have appeared three papers @xcite in quant - ph this year that purport to show that the @xmath1 scheme reported in @xcite is insecure in various ways .",
    "these criticisms are briefly summarized and responded to in this appendix .",
    "a general criticism seems to be made in ref .",
    "@xcite that our claim in @xcite on the possible use of amplifiers in coherent - state cryptosystems can not be valid .",
    "it is not clear exactly what this objection is . in any event ,",
    "we qualify such use in our papers by the statement that security must be guaranteed for e attacking near the transmitter , since quantum amplifiers generally degrade the communication performance .",
    "there are three specific criticisms from ref .",
    "@xcite that one can ascertain :          in response , observe that only complexity - based security is ever claimed in @xcite against joint attack on the key @xmath5 .",
    "the other information - theoretic security claimed is on individual ciphertext - only attack on the data .",
    "as discussed in section vii , it is quite sufficient to have complexity - based security if it can be proved exponential , which is only reduced by a factor of @xmath373 with the grover search .",
    "long keys of thousands of bits can be used in @xmath1 at high speed both in software and hardware implementation , making the exponential search completely ineffective .",
    "furthermore , the grover search can not be launched against @xmath1 with a @xmath278 db loss .",
    "if it can , there is no need for the @xmath44 copies extensively discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . indeed , there is no discussion there on how the grover or any search can be launched with a @xmath278 db loss .",
    "there is a general misclaim in some papers on quantum cryptography that a @xmath278 db loss on a coherent state cryptosystem renders it insecure because e can obtain a copy of the quantum ciphertext identical to b. this is not true even without the use of a secret key .",
    "it is not true for b92 @xcite or yk @xcite or the usual - state scheme described in @xcite , although it renders a coherent - state bb84 scheme and some ` continuous -variable ' schemes essentially insecure .",
    "when a secret key @xmath5 is used , it is not true at all .",
    "indeed , the possibility of key generation while granting e a full copy to bound her performance depends on this being not true .",
    "as explained in this paper , knowledge of the secret key allows b to make a better measurement than e , who can not attain the same performance as b even if she knows the key later .",
    "it is true that when @xmath44 copies are available to e , there is no information - theoretic security left in a known - plaintext attack on direct encryption , and key generation is impossible .",
    "but it is clear that no one would contemplate the operation of cryptosystem over such a huge loss @xmath374 without intermittent amplifiers or other compensating devices .",
    "numerically , @xmath374 corresponds to the propagation loss over one thousand kilometers of low - loss fibers without amplifiers for just @xmath375 bits in @xmath1 with @xmath376 .",
    "it is totally out of the realm of possibility to sustain such loss even in ordinary optical communication without cryptography . as the use of amplifiers is suggested in @xcite , it is hard to see why such a criticism is relevant . as a matter of fact ,",
    "@xmath1 in its original form is insecure at a much smaller loss than @xmath374 for any reasonable @xmath14 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is claimed that a device can be found that would lead to a bit error rate @xmath377 much lower than the quantum detection theory result @xmath378 reported in @xcite for individual ciphertext - only attack on the data .",
    "as pointed out by several others including g. barbosa and o. hirota , such a device can not exist because violating quantum detection theory means violating the laws of quantum physics . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is claimed that @xmath1 is merely a classical cipher .",
    "the exact nature of @xmath1 for key generation has been analyzed in section v , and for direct encryption in section vii .",
    "while @xmath1 can indeed be run in the classical limit and even in just software , the blanket claim that @xmath1 is classical for intermediate and large signal energy , and hence presumably does not permit key generation , is incorrect because their equation ( 10 ) does not hold exactly .",
    "in particular , the discussion around ( [ c ] ) in our section v.a shows how @xmath1 in just its original form may allow key generation . for a further concise discussion , see ref .",

    "<S> a new approach to quantum cryptography to be called kcq , keyed communication in quantum noise , is developed on the basis of quantum detection and communication theory for classical information transmission . by the use of a shared secret key that determines the quantum states generated for different data bit sequences </S>",
    "<S> , the users may employ the corresponding optimum quantum measurement to decode the data . </S>",
    "<S> this gives them a better error performance than an attacker who does not know the key when she makes her quantum measurement , and an overall generation of a fresh key may be obtained from the resulting advantage . </S>",
    "<S> this principle is illustrated in the operation of a concrete qubit system a general information - theoretic description of the overall approach will be presented , and contrasted with the detection / coding description necessary for specific protocols . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the attacker s error probability profile is needed for a complete assessment of her information on the generated key . </S>",
    "<S> the criterion of protocol efficiency and its sensitivity to system parameter fluctuation is proposed as another benchmark on the evaluation of key generation protocols . for systems described by infinite - dimensional state spaces referred to as qumodes , kcq </S>",
    "<S> key generation schemes with coherent states of considerable energy will be presented together with corresponding security analysis . </S>",
    "<S> various advantage enhancement and randomization techniques are introduced for improving the security and efficiency of such protocols . </S>",
    "<S> a specific @xmath0-ary coherent orthogonal signaling scheme , cppm , is presented that can yield efficient secure key generation over long - distance telecomm fibers using conventional optical technology . </S>",
    "<S> the issue of secrecy in direct encryption using kcq is also discussed in general and in connection with the @xmath1 protocol , on which experimental progress has been made . </S>",
    "<S> it is indicated that information - theoretic security against known - plaintext attack is possible , which has never been suggested for any cryptosystem . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is shown that cppm offers information - theoretic security against known - plaintext attacks while the data are unconditionally secure . some qualitative comparison among the different key generation schemes </S>",
    "<S> are made from both a fundamental and a practical viewpoint . </S>",
    "<S> further quantitative development , the detailed analysis of direct encryption , and the effects of various advantage enhancement techniques would be presented in future papers of this series . </S>",
    "<S> some apparent gaps in the unconditional security proofs of previous protocols are indicated in appendix a. the core of the paper is contained in sections iii and vi . + </S>",
