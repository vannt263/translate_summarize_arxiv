    "percolation is a quite common phenomena in nature . among known examples there are epidemic diseases of garden trees , forest fires , the process of espresso preparation , ising spins at criticality , etc . @xcite .",
    "ising spins are correlated with probability @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is coupling constant , @xmath3 - boltzmann factor and @xmath4 - temperature ) and clusters of parallel spins percolate at the critical temperature @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "percolation is the simplest example of a critical phenomenon . scaling relations for infinite lattices",
    "were developed in the same way as for the ising model @xcite .",
    "mapping of the percolation model onto a @xmath6 state potts model @xcite gave a way to predict critical exponents for percolation in two dimensions using techniques of conformal field theory ( cft ) or of coulomb gas representation .",
    "in the last few years , new insights into the properties of percolation clusters on infinite lattices at the critical concentration have been developed .",
    "first of all , langlands and coauthors found numerically @xcite that the probability of a cluster spanning the lattice horizontally is an universal function of the aspect ratio only , and does not depend on the lattice symmetry or on the type of percolation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "second , aizenman proved that there could be more than one incipient spanning cluster in two - dimensional critical percolation @xcite .",
    "his results were in contradiction with a wide - spread belief that the percolation cluster is unique ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "numerical results for percolation in a strip demonstrated that there could be more than one cluster spanning the short direction in a strip @xcite .",
    "later aizenman s proposal was supported numerically for the case of bond percolation @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    finally , cardy conjectured an exact form for the probability that @xmath7 clusters span a large strip or open cylinder of aspect ratio @xmath8 , in the limit when @xmath7 is large @xcite .",
    "his result is in a complete agreement with the aizenman theorem .",
    "the assumptions of conformal field theory are not rigorously established , and it remains important to perform precise numerical tests of the theory .",
    "i present here an extensive numerical verification of cardy s proposal .",
    "the numerical data were obtained in collaboration with sergey kosyakov @xcite .    in section  2",
    "some known facts on percolation probabilities are shortly reviewed .",
    "spanning probability are discussed in section  3 .",
    "most recent findings on the multiplicity of incipient spanning clusters ( isc ) , are discussed in section  4 , where our previously published results for the isc probabilities in bond percolation are compared with the proposed exact result .",
    "the computational method is described in the section  5 .",
    "new results for the finite size corrections of spanning probabilities in a strip geometry with up to 819200 sites are presented in sections  6 and 7 for open boundaries and cylinder geometry .",
    "preliminary results for the spanning probabilities in a simple cubic critical percolation with the samples with up to 1900544 sites are presented in section  8 .",
    "all averages were done using @xmath9 strips in all geometries investigated .",
    "discussion and acknowledgements finish the paper .",
    "the simplest model of percolation is bond percolation on the square lattice .",
    "let us consider a two dimensional ( 2d ) rectangle with an infinite number of sites @xmath10 in both ( vertical and horizontal ) directions .",
    "the probability for the bond to be occupied ( or placed , or black ) is equal to @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "consequently , the probability for the bond to be open ( or removed , or white ) is equal to @xmath13 .",
    "if all bonds are closed ( that is @xmath14 ) the left side is connected with the right one by closed bonds . that is closed , paths from the left boundary to the right boundary",
    "clearly , if all bonds are open ones ( @xmath15 ) there is no way to go by closed bonds through the rectangle .",
    "it appears that there is some value of the probability @xmath16 dividing these two possibilities .",
    "the value of critical probability @xmath16 is equal to @xmath17 for bond percolation in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "this can be seen from the self - duality of the 2d square lattice .",
    "the dual lattice is constructed placing open bonds across the closed bonds on the prime lattice , and by drawing closed dual bonds across the open prime bonds .",
    "an example configuration is plotted in fig .",
    "it is clear from the construction that the number of closed prime bonds is equal to the number of open dual bonds . if @xmath11 is the probability that a bond is closed on the prime lattice , then @xmath13 is the probability that the chosen bond be closed on the dual lattice . for",
    "a given probability @xmath11 of closed bonds , let us denote by @xmath18 the probability that there is a path of connected closed bonds connecting left and right sides of the prime lattice .",
    "that is @xmath18 is the probability of a cluster spanning the lattice horizontally .",
    "by @xmath19 we will denote probability that a cluster of closed bonds spans the dual lattice vertically for a given probability @xmath20 of closed dual bonds .",
    "two relations follows    @xmath21    the prime and dual lattices are identical in this construction .",
    "therefore , the percolation threshold should be at @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 .",
    "a strong proof of that statement is the main subject of kesten s book @xcite .    for the finite system with square size @xmath24 the probability @xmath25 of a horizontal",
    "crossing is shown on fig .",
    "[ step ] as a function of @xmath11 for several @xmath10 .",
    "the slope of this curve grows with the lattice size @xmath10 as @xmath26 , @xmath27 being the correlation length exponent @xcite .",
    "is is clearly visible that @xmath25 approaches a step function as @xmath10 tends to infinity .",
    "indeed , there are strong mathematical results @xcite supporting this picture .        what is the value of the spanning probability exactly at the percolation threshold @xmath16 ?",
    "it was believed for a long time that this value was equal to the value of the percolation threshold @xcite .",
    "indeed , this is true for the bond percolation on the square lattice . from relations ( [ phv ] ) for the bond percolation on the infinite square lattice",
    "it is clear that    @xmath28    at the same time , the real space renormalization analysis @xcite are based on the relation @xmath29 for the site percolation . in the last case @xmath30 , which is fairly close to 0.5 and reasonable results for the critical exponents were computed .",
    "however it was recognized later that the value of spanning probability @xmath31 does not depend on the type of percolation as the percolation threshold does .",
    "moreover it turns out that this value is invariant and depends only on the aspect ratio of the rectangle @xcite .",
    "all results described in this section as well as in the following sections are obtained for critical percolation .",
    "the probability @xmath11 for the bond ( or site ) to be closed is equal to the corresponding critical value @xmath16 throughout the remaining text .",
    "the value of @xmath16 is not universal and depends on the dimensionality , lattice type ( square , honeycomb , etc . ) and percolation type ( site , bond , etc . ) .",
    "the spanning probability appears to be universal and invariant under shape transformations of the rectangle , also depends on the boundary conditions @xcite ( see also the mini review by stauffer @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider a strip with vertical size @xmath32 and horizontal size @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the aspect ratio .",
    "incipient spanning clusters connect two segments on the boundary of a macroscopically large strip .",
    "langlands et al .",
    "@xcite found numerically evidence that the probability that a such cluster exists is invariant under conformal transformation .",
    "cardy conjectured an exact formula for this probability @xcite in terms of hypergeometric functions    @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the gamma function and hypergeometric function respectively and @xmath38 , where @xmath7 defines the aspect ratio @xmath8 of the rectangle @xmath39 as the ratio of two complete elliptic integrals @xmath40 .",
    "the modulus @xmath7 is associated with the positions @xmath41 on the real axes mapped under a schwartz - christoffel transformation to the vertices @xmath42 of rectangle .",
    "thus , the probability @xmath43 is just the probability that there are closed paths ( incipient spanning clusters ) which connect the interval @xmath44 with the opposite one @xmath45 .",
    "this conjecture of cardy was confirmed numerically by langlands , et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a more practical form of spanning probability was developed by ziff as series expansion in powers of @xmath46 @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "note , the corrections @xmath46 to the leading behaviour @xmath49 decay very fast with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "the probability that at least one cluster spans the square with open boundaries in both directions is equal to @xmath17 .",
    "this value could be obtained from ( [ exact1 ] ) or ( [ z14ab ] ) at @xmath50 .    in the case of cylinder the spanning probability along the cylinder",
    "is not known exactly .",
    "simulations by hovi and aharony @xcite give the value @xmath51 for the aspect ratio @xmath50 .",
    "in a forthcoming paper @xcite we compute the spanning probabilities @xmath52 for the aspect ratio @xmath8 in the interval @xmath53 for cylindrical geometry as well in the interval @xmath54 in open geometry with the step @xmath55 .",
    "the quality of these results will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "in the following sections we will also compute the probabilities that at least two , and even more clusters simultaneously span the lattice from left to right .    it was a common belief until recently that percolation clusters are unique on the 2d lattice .",
    "aizenman proposed quite recently in his lecture at the statistical physics 19 conference in china @xcite that the number of incipient spanning clusters ( isc ) in 2d can be larger than one .",
    "later he proved @xcite that the probability @xmath56 that at least @xmath7 iscs span horizontally ( that is along @xmath57 ) the strip @xmath58 with width @xmath59 and horizontal length @xmath57 bounded    @xmath60    where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are different positive constants expected to merge for an infinite lattice @xcite .",
    "indications of the existence of simultaneous clusters in two - dimensional critical percolation in the limit of infinite lattices were found in computer simulations by sen@xcite for site percolation on square lattices with helical boundary conditions and in a short strips by hu and lin @xcite using their monte carlo histogram method .",
    "we checked numerically the number of spanning clusters in the critical bond percolation model on two - dimensional square lattices @xcite .",
    "we have determined the numerical values of probabilities @xmath63 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 by means of finite - size scaling .",
