    "the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis ( mfdfa ) @xcite became in last ten years the major technique used for studying the multifractal properties in complex systems and in time series .",
    "more then 500 papers discusses mfdfa issues in variety of problems related with complexity ( see , e.g. , @xcite@xcite ) . the central role in mfdfa",
    "is played by the @xmath1-th moment of fluctuation function ( @xmath3 ) defined as @xcite    @xmath4^{q/2}\\right\\}^{1/q}\\ ] ]    for @xmath5 , and @xmath6\\right\\}\\ ] ] for @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) are data in series , @xmath11 is the size of window box in which detrending is performed , while @xmath12 is the polynomial trend subtracted for @xmath13-th data in @xmath14-th window box ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the observed scaling law @xmath16 is crucial within mfdfa to estimate the multifractal properties of a signal given by the profile of generalized hurst exponents @xmath0 .",
    "the strength of multifractality present in data is usually studied as a spread @xmath17    @xmath18    of some edge values of generalized hurst exponent @xmath19 calculated at the fixed negative ( @xmath20 ) and positive ( @xmath21 ) moments respectively ( @xmath22 ) .    in the case of stationary series",
    ", @xmath0 is proven to be a monotonically decreasing function and therefore @xmath23 @xcite . however , many examples shown recently in literature for synthetic data @xcite as well as for realistic signals @xcite reveal that multifractal properties may lay far outside this simplest scenario and the spread @xmath24 , defined as the difference of generalized hurst exponents calculated for small negative and large positive fluctuation moments , is not indicative in these cases .    a non - monotonic behavior of @xmath0 profile is observed for instance in nonstationary data what leads to twisted @xmath25 multifractal spectrum @xcite if the hlder description of multifractality is adopted with a help of legendre transform @xcite . in the case of nonstationary data with periodicity ,",
    "white or color noise added ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) one may see domains where @xmath0 is either increasing or decreasing with @xmath1 , local maxima in @xmath0 are formed or even @xmath26 suggesting that big fluctuations may appear more often than small ones .",
    "it is contrary to observations in stationary data @xcite where it should be the other way round .",
    "there are examples of realistic time series where the multifractal profile , despite small and insignificant @xmath17 spread , significantly expands in the central part for moment orders @xmath27 .",
    "one finds such behavior for instance for nonlinearly transformed financial data containing extreme events ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the similar spread @xmath17 may correspond also to significantly different characteristics of the @xmath0 profile in the center for @xmath27 .",
    "the above results convince that a traditional measurement of multifractality within mfdfa , based entirely on the @xmath17 spread may be misleading . therefore we propose in this article an alternative measure of multifractal properties which takes into account the behavior of the multifractal profile @xmath0 as a whole for all @xmath1-th order moments , not limited only to the edge values @xmath19 found at @xmath28 .",
    "as pointed above , the new measure should be sensitive to behavior of the whole @xmath0 profile in the wide range of @xmath1 moments ( @xmath29 ) and should not neglect the multiscaling properties within this range of @xmath1 s , contrary to the standard measure based on the spread @xmath17 alone which takes into account just the edge values of the generalized hurst exponents @xmath30 .",
    "in the simplest case of multifractal data with the abandoned effects of so called multifractal bias , generally discussed in @xcite , a natural extension of @xmath17 can be defined as a cumulated distance between the multifractal profile @xmath0 and the main hurst exponent value @xmath31 for considered series .",
    "one may write then a new measure @xmath32 in the integral form @xmath33    it turns out that @xmath34 has an interesting interpretation of the scaling exponent in the new power law linking the geometric mean of detrended @xmath1-th order fluctuations @xmath35 of the signal for all @xmath1 values with the size @xmath11 of the time window .",
    "indeed , consider the normalized detrended @xmath1-th moment of fluctuation @xmath36 defined as follows @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the standard deviation of detrended fluctuation ( @xmath39 ) in time window of length @xmath11 .",
    "using the power law from eq.(4 ) we may write the relationship @xmath40 where @xmath41 is some function generally dependent on @xmath1 but independent on @xmath11 . hence , using definition from eq.(6 )    @xmath42    replacing @xmath43 by @xmath44 and @xmath1 by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , the first integral in rhs of eq.(9 ) can be approximated by a discrete sum @xmath47^{\\frac{1}{n}}\\ ] ] comparing eqs(9 ) and ( 10 ) , one gets in the continuous limit @xmath48 @xmath49^{\\frac{1}{n } } + \\int_{-q}^{q}c(q)\\,\\mathrm{d}q\\ ] ] the latter relation builds after simple rearrangement the postulated power law @xmath50^{\\frac{1}{n } } \\sim \\tau^{\\delta^{(2)}_h}\\ ] ] note that the standard spread of generalized hurst exponents values used in mfdfa to determine the multifractal content can also be interpreted in the above context as the scaling exponent in the power law @xmath51 which links together @xmath11 with the ratio of the smallest ( @xmath52 ) and the biggest ( @xmath53 ) detrended @xmath1 deformed fluctuations .",
    "hence , the scaling in eq.(12 ) related with geometric mean of all detrended fluctuations @xmath54 , can be regarded as the modification of mfdfa method we call gmfdfa ( geometric mean mfdfa ) .",
    "we will test the behavior of the new measure analyzing first the synthetic multifractal signals with apriori well known multiscaling properties .",
    "they were generated from the binomial random cascade algorithm @xcite for the almost complete range of @xmath55 parameter describing the richness of multifractal content in synthetic signal ( @xmath56 ) with a step @xmath57 .",
    "[ delta_vs_a ] shows the plot of analytical expectation @xmath58 in this model obtained from the relation @xcite @xmath59 and compared with two numerical findings , respectively for the standard @xmath17 and `` new '' @xmath60 measure , calculated for @xmath61 from numerical simulation of @xmath0 profile .",
    "these plots prove that in a case of synthetic data new measure of multifractal content is qualitatively and quantitatively indistinguishable from the standard measure based on the spread @xmath17 of the edges @xmath62 .",
    "the simple recipe for the new measure will have to be modified if so called multifractal bias effects are to be included in analysis @xcite .",
    "let us recall here main issues connected with such multifractal bias .",
    "it is defined as the continuous set of profiles @xmath0 calculated for a given system or signal , which do not correspond to multifractal properties of this system at some confidence level , despite @xmath63 .",
    "such bias can be seen particularly in short signals where accidental fluctuations , not related with multifractal properties , contribute to fluctuation function and dominate over fluctuations having their origin in multifractal properties of the signal due to small statistics of short data .",
    "it raises the @xmath64 edge of the multifractal spread . on the other hand ,",
    "the influence of large fluctuations in short data set can be suppressed since mfdfa algorithm may treat such fluctuations as longer trends and eliminate them .",
    "in both cases the observed @xmath17 spread is increased comparing with the corresponding value obtained for much longer data and grows with persistency in signal @xcite .",
    "another source of multifractal bias are nonlinear transformations performed on data which introduce always additional registered multifractal effect .",
    "the level of multifractal bias in series can be calculated or simulated with a number of semi - analytic formulas provided in @xcite .",
    "note that deliberately we do not mix this bias effect here with so called spurious multifractality @xcite caused by various external contaminations in signal or nonstationarities coming , e.g. , from the influence of noise present in data .",
    "when taking multifractal bias into account , one has to generalize the formula in eq.(6 ) , replacing @xmath65 in there by the corresponding multifractal bias thresholds @xmath66 at the assumed confidence level ( @xmath67 throughout this article ) . here",
    "@xmath68 are respectively the upper ( @xmath69 ) and the lower ( @xmath70 ) edge of the bias area ( ribbon ) explained in fig .",

    "[ artistic ] .    a new measure of multifractality @xmath74 generalizes the multifractal spread @xmath17 in such a way , that it can be used for particular profiles @xmath71 even if the standard @xmath17 measure could not be applied ( e.g. , when @xmath76 or @xmath77 ) .",
    "one always gets @xmath78 describing multiscaling properties in a system for the whole range of fluctuation moments .",
    "the result @xmath79 means that the observed multifractal profile entirely lies in a biased ribbon domain for all moment orders @xmath1 and hence there are no expected real multifractal effects even if @xmath80 .",
    "note , however , that the maximum value of @xmath21 at which the new measure is calculated can not be too high , since then the contribution to the profile @xmath0 with high volatility may be dominated by domains where @xmath81 .",
    "in order to present the qualities of proposed measure @xmath74 let us start with analysis of synthetic signals obtained from binomial cascade model , additionally , taking into account the multifractal bias .",

    "[ cascades_withb ] for two values of cascade parameter @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) .",

    "the latter ones are assumed to be null if the edges @xmath94 satisfy @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , one gets @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the bias level and @xmath98 is the unbiased spread of generalized hurst exponents . in case of synthetic multifractals , the new measure @xmath74 gives results similar to unbiased multifractal spread @xmath86 as seen from tabularized values in table  [ cascades - table ] .",
