    "systems that include heavy quark - antiquark pairs ( quarkonia ) are an ideal and unique laboratory to probe both the high energy regimes of qcd , where an expansion in terms of the coupling constant is possible , and the low energy regimes , where non - perturbative effects dominate .    recently , this field has experienced a rapid expansion with a wealth of new data coming in from diverse sources : data on quarkonium formation from dedicated experiments ( bes at bepc , kedr at vepp-4 m cleo - c at cesr ) , clear samples produced by high luminosity @xmath0-factories ( pep - ii and kekb ) , and very large samples produced from gluon - gluon fusion in @xmath1 annihilations at the tevatron ( cdf and d0 experiments ) .    .",
    "the theory predictions are according to the potential models described in ref .",

    "although the possibility of bound states of two quarks and two antiquarks or of quark - antiquark pairs and gluons has been predicted since the very start of the quark model  @xcite , no observed state has yet been attributed to one of them : such an achievement would be a major step in the understanding of the strong interaction .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as far as the mass and width of the @xmath2 are concerned , babar has published an analysis of the @xmath3 decays with @xmath4  @xcite while belle has updated the mass measurements in @xmath5 decays  @xcite .",

    "there is an indication that the particle decaying into @xmath6 is different from the one decaying into @xmath7 , their masses differing by about 4.5 standard deviations .",
    "recently , babar published an updated analysis of the @xmath2 with their complete dataset  @xcite , studying the discovery mode of the @xmath8 . updated branching fraction results ( see table  [ tab : xsec ] for details ) and updated mesaurements of @xmath9 ( @xmath10 mev / c@xmath11 ) and the natural width ( @xmath12 mev / c@xmath11 ) were provided .",

    "the latter paper also reported evidence for @xmath20 and some events of @xmath21 .",
    "while investigating whether the @xmath22 decayed to @xmath23 babar did not find evidence for such a decay .",
    "instead , they discovered a new @xmath15 state , the @xmath24  @xcite . while the absence of @xmath25 decays",
    "could be explained if the pion pair in the @xmath26 decay were produced with an intermediate state that is too massive to be produced with a @xmath27 ( e.g. an @xmath28 ) , the absence of @xmath29 is still to be understood , more statistics might be needed in case the @xmath22 decay hides the @xmath24 .    recently , belle has published the confirmation of all of these @xmath15 states  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they have unveiled a new state that was not clearly visible in the babar data due to the limited statistics : the @xmath30 .",
    "figures  [ fig : belle1 mm ] and  [ fig : belle1mm2s ] show the published invariant mass spectra for both the @xmath26 and the @xmath23 decays .",

    "although the subtraction of the continuum is missing , there is some indication that only the @xmath30 has a well defined intermediate state ( most likely an @xmath31 ) , while others have a more complex structure .",
    "a discriminant measurement between charmonium states and new aggregation forms is the relative decay rate between these decays into charmonium and the decays into two charm mesons .",

    "[ fig : babarjpsiomega]_,width=302 ]      three different states have been observed in recent years by the belle collaboration with masses close to @xmath37 : one , named @xmath38 , observed in continuum events ( i.e. not in @xmath39 decays ) produced in tandem with a @xmath40 meson and decaying into @xmath41  @xcite ; a second one , named @xmath42 , observed in @xmath0 decays and decaying into @xmath43  @xcite ; a third one , named @xmath44 produced in two - photon reactions and decaying into @xmath45-pairs  @xcite .",
    "while the @xmath38 is consistent with both @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the quantum number assignment of the @xmath42 and the @xmath44 states is clear : @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively .",
    "finally the @xmath42 is the only apparently broad state ( @xmath50mev ) .    because of these quantum number assignments and their masses these states are good candidates for the radial excitation of the @xmath51 mesons , in particular the @xmath52 meson could be identified with the @xmath53 and the @xmath54 with the @xmath55 .",
    "the unclear points are the identification of the @xmath56 state and the explanation of why the @xmath54 state does not decay preferentially to @xmath45 mesons .",
    "the most recent development on this topic is the confirmation from the babar collaboration of the @xmath57 decays  @xcite .",
    "the analysis utilizes the decay properties of the @xmath58 meson to extract a clean signal ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : babarjpsiomega ] ) .",
    "the interesting part is that the mass and width measured in this paper are lower than when previously observed , albeit consistent ( @xmath59mev@xmath60 , @xmath61mev ) , opens the interesting possibility that the @xmath38 and the @xmath42 particles be the same , thus solving the two aforementioned open issues .",
    "as we have already discussed , it is critical to investigate decay channels of the new states into @xmath45 meson pairs .",
    "unfortunately the detection efficiency for @xmath45 mesons is low , due to the large number of possible decay channels .",
    "the belle collaboration has developed a partial reconstruction technique that overcomes this limitation in the case of new states produced in continuum paired with known charmonium states  @xcite .",
    "the charmonium is fully reconstructed , while only one of the two d mesons is reconstructed .",
    "the kinematics of the other is inferred from the known center - of - mass energy and the different possibile @xmath45 mesons are discriminated on the basis of the missing mass .",
    "this technique has allowed the confirmation of the @xmath56 production and decay , and , most interestingly , the observation of the @xmath62 state , decaying into @xmath63 .",
    "given the fact that , for reasons yet to be understood , continuum events seem to produce @xmath64 or @xmath47 states in pair with the @xmath40 and since the measured mass is consistent with the expectations of a radial excitation of the @xmath65 , this new state is likely to be an @xmath66 .",
    "invariant mass distribution in @xmath67 decays.__,width=302 ]      perhaps , the real turning point in the query for states beyond the charmonium was the observation by the belle collaboration of a charged state decaying into @xmath69  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : bellez4430 ] shows the fit to the @xmath70 invariant mass distribution in @xmath67 decays , returning a mass @xmath71 and a width @xmath72 mev . due to the relevance of such an observation a large number of tests have been performed , breaking the sample in several subsamples and finding consistent results in all cases . also , the possibility of a reflection of a @xmath73 decay has been falsified by explicitely vetoing windows in the @xmath74 invariant mass .    in terms of quarks ,",
    "such a state must contain a @xmath75 and a @xmath76 , but given its charge it must also contain at least a @xmath77 and a @xmath78 .",
    "the only open options are the tetraquark , the molecule or the threshold effects .",
    "the latter two options are possible due to the closeness of the @xmath79 threshold .",
    "finding the corresponding neutral state , observing a decay mode of the same state or at least having a confirmation of its existence , are critical before a complete picture can be drawn .",
    "more than 30 years after its first observation , the heavy - quarkonium is still an exciting laboratory for understanding qcd .",
    "the study of well established quarkonium states yields information on low energy qcd while the understanding of the quarkonium spectroscopy , predictable in potential models , allows searches for different aggregation states than the long established mesons .",
    "the high statistics and quality data from @xmath0-factories have produced a very large number of new states whose interpretation is still a matter of debate .",
    "this paper attempted a categorized review of the information pertaining to these states , as we know it today .",
    "many theoretical models have been developed to interpret the situation but the picture is far from complete : more precise predictions are needed from theory and a systematic experimental exploration of all possibile production and decay mechanisms of these new states is still in the works .",
    "it is clear that a super-@xmath0 factory will be essential to gain a complete understanding of the true nature of these states .",
