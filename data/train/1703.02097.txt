    "magnetic frustration , which often leads to interesting spin structures , refers to systems where the total free energy can not be minimized by optimizing the interaction energy between each pair of spins@xcite .",
    "magnetic interactions can be frustrated by geometry .",
    "for example , magnetic long range order is prohibited for the heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular ( or tetrahedral ) lattice@xcite .",
    "the corresponding magnetic ground state , named spin liquid , is highly degenerate@xcite .",
    "in addition to geometry , the competition between different types of magnetic interactions can also lead to magnetic frustration .",

    "the effect of disorder has been widely investigated in magnetic materials and disorder is commonly used to generate spin glasses@xcite . in general , a spin glass ( sg ) state prevails in systems dominated by randomness and frustration , which can be realized by either site- or bond - disorder .",
    "site - disorder arises when ions with different magnetic properties may be found randomly distributed on the same crystallographic sites , and is a very effective way to frustrate the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction .",
    "sg alloys such as cu - mn , au - mn and au - fe belong to this category@xcite .",
    "moreover , sg can also be induced by diluting magnetic sites using nonmagnetic ions to pass the site - disorder percolation threshold ( @xmath8 ) , as in  eu@xmath1sr@xmath2s ( @xmath8  @xmath10  0.136)@xcite .",
    "bond - disorder arises due to randomization of bond - length .",
    "recent theoretical advances@xcite strongly suggest that bond - disorder is essential to generate a sg state in magnetic pyrochlores and spinels such as y@xmath0mo@xmath0o@xmath3@xcite and zn(cr@xmath1ga@xmath2)@xmath0o@xmath9@xcite .  in the latter compound ,",
    "the sg is not related to the site - disorder since the onset composition of sg , 0.2  <  _ x _",

    "whether bond - disorder alone can lead to magnetic frustration remains to be unveiled .",
    "although bond - disorder is decisive in y@xmath0mo@xmath0o@xmath3 and zn(cr@xmath1ga@xmath2)@xmath0o@xmath9@xcite , its influence on magnetic frustration is not clear due to the coexisting geometric frustration in these materials .",
    "theoretically , it is argued that the weak bond - disorder acts as a perturbation to partially lift the degeneracy of a spin liquid@xcite . from this point of view , bond - disorder does not facilitate magnetic frustration in systems composed of antiferromagnetically coupled spins .",
    "in addition , neither of the theories mentioned above could reproduce the critical region ( 0.2  <  _ x _  <  0.25 ) for the nel to sg phase transition in zn(cr@xmath1ga@xmath2)@xmath0o@xmath9@xcite .        to demonstrate the exclusive influence of bond - disorder on magnetic frustration , or in other words , to avoid geometric frustration ,",

    ". since cr - sites are percolative in y@xmath0crsbo@xmath3@xcite , site - disorder can not be the driving mechanism of the observed high magnetic frustration .",
    "we have also carried out comprehensive numerical simulations to study the percolation processes of various nonmagnetic clusters , including bond - disorder , site - disorder , and the intermediate types in between ( see section  [ iii ] ) .  based on these simulations , bond - disorder percolates at @xmath6  =  0.23(1 ) on a pyrochlore lattice , pointing to the percolative bond - disorder in y@xmath0crsbo@xmath3 ( _ x _  =  0.5 ) .",
