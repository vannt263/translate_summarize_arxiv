    "one motivation for this work is that intersubband ( isb ) _ charge _ dynamics in quantum wells is currently of great experimental and theoretical interest , @xcite since electronic isb transitions are the basis of a variety of new devices operating in the terahertz frequency regime , such as detectors , @xcite modulators @xcite and quantum cascade lasers .",

    "population decay from an excited to a lower conduction subband is measured by an intersubband relaxation time @xmath7 , and loss of coherence of collective intersubband excitations is measured by a dephasing time @xmath8 .",
    "these two times have been measured experimentally for isb charge - density excitations in quantum wells @xcite and found to differ substantially at low temperatures , @xmath8 being three orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath7 .",
    "the reason is that intersubband relaxation proceeds mainly via phonon emission and is thus slowed down by an energy bottleneck for small phonon momenta as well as for the optical phonon branch .",
    "this differs from the case of conduction electron spin relaxation , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are comparable .",
    "@xcite    on the other hand , dephasing of collective isb excitations in quantum wells is determined by a complex interplay of a variety of different scattering mechanisms , whose relative importance is not _ a priori _ obvious . in recent experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite work",
