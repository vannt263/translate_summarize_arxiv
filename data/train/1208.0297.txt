    "all these positive detections are based on low - resolution spectra .",
    "so far similar searches with high - resolution spectra have been unsuccessful .",
    "this was the case for observations of comets 122p / de vico , c/1995 o1 ( hale - bopp ) , and 153p/2002 c1 ( ikeya - zhang ) that did not detect n@xmath2 band , yielding upper limits of @xmath5 10@xmath610@xmath7 on the abundance of n@xmath1 relative to co ( cochran et al . 2000 ; cochran 2002 ) .",
    "an interpretation of the possible n@xmath1 deficiency in comets has been proposed by iro et al .",
    "these authors assumed that comets were made of clathrate hydrates ( hereafter clathrates ) and argued that co was preferentially incorporated in clathrates compared to n@xmath1 after having investigated the competition between the trapping of these two molecules in clathrates .",
    "in order to explain the n@xmath1 deficiency in comets , they argued that the nebula s temperature never cooled down below @xmath045 k in their formation region , impeding the formation of n@xmath1-bearing ice ( in clathrate or pure condensate form ) that would have been agglomerated by comets .",
    "however , this mechanism is not consistent with the fact that pluto and triton * possess thick nitrogen ice covers * ( lellouch et al .",
    "2011 ) while they are both expected to have been formed in the same region of the primitive nebula as ecliptic comets ( kavelaars et al .",
    "in addition , iro et al .",
    "( 2003 ) did not consider the competition between the trapping of n@xmath1 in clathrates with that of the other abundant volatiles present in the nebula ( co , co@xmath1 , ch@xmath8 , h@xmath1s , ... ) . indeed , due to their various propensities for trapping , the consideration of a larger set of molecules can drastically change the calculated fraction of n@xmath1 incorporated in clathrates formed in the nebula .",
    "here we propose a scenario that could explain the apparent n@xmath1 deficiency in comets in a way consistent with the presence of this molecule * on the surfaces of pluto and triton*. we use a statistical thermodynamic model to investigate the composition of the successive multiple guest clathrates ( hereafter mg clathrates ) that may have formed during the cooling of the primordial nebula from the most abundant volatiles present in the gas phase ( see section 2 ) .",
    "these clathrates agglomerated with the other ices and formed the building blocks of comets ( hereafter cometesimals )",
    ". the major ingredient of our model is the description of the guest - clathrate interaction by a spherically averaged kihara potential with a nominal set of potential parameters .",
    "our model allows us to report that n@xmath1 is a poor clathrate former when considering a plausible gas phase composition of the primordial nebula , implying that its trapping into cometesimals requires a low disk s temperature ( @xmath020 k ) in order to allow the formation of its pure condensate .",
    "we find that it is possible to explain the lack of nitrogen in comets as a consequence of their postaccretion internal heating engendered by the decay of radiogenic nuclides ( see section 3 ) .",
    "in our model , the volatile phase incorporated in cometesimals is composed of a * mixture * of pure ices , stoichiometric hydrates ( such as * nh@xmath9-h@xmath1o hydrate * ) and mg clathrates that crystallized in the form of microscopic grains at various temperatures in the outer part of the disk . our model is based on the assumption that cometesimals have grown from the agglomeration of these icy grains due to collisional coagulation , implying no loss of volatile during their growth phase ( weidenschilling 1997 ) . here",
    ", the clathration process stops when no more crystalline water ice is available to trap the volatile species and then only pure condensates form at lower temperature in the disk .",
    "the process of volatiles trapping in icy grains is calculated using the equilibrium curves of hydrates and pure condensates , our model determining the equilibrium curves and compositions of mg clathrates , and the thermodynamic paths detailing the evolution of temperature and pressure between 5 and 30 au in the protoplanetary disk .",
    "we refer to the work of alibert et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for a full description of the turbulent model of accretion disk used here .",
    "the composition of the initial gas phase of the disk is defined as follows : we assume that the abundances of all elements ( c , n , o , s , p , ar , kr and xe ) are protosolar ( asplund et al . 2009 ) and that o , c , and n exist only under the form of h@xmath1o , co , co@xmath1 , ch@xmath9oh , ch@xmath8 , n@xmath1 , and nh@xmath9 .",
    "the abundances of co , co@xmath1 , ch@xmath9oh , ch@xmath8 , n@xmath1 and nh@xmath9 are then determined from the adopted co : co@xmath1:ch@xmath9oh : ch@xmath8 and n@xmath1:nh@xmath9 gas phase molecular ratios .",
    "once the abundances of these molecules are fixed , the remaining o gives the abundance of h@xmath1o .",
    "concerning the distribution of elements in the main volatile molecules , we set co : co@xmath1:ch@xmath9oh : ch@xmath8  =  70:10:2:1 in the gas phase of the disk , values that are consistent with the ism measurements considering the contributions of both gas and solid phases in the lines of sight ( mousis et al .",
    "in addition , s is assumed to exist in the form of h@xmath1s , with h@xmath1s : h@xmath1  =  0.5 @xmath10(s / h@xmath1)@xmath11 , and other refractory sulfide components .",
    "we also consider n@xmath1:nh@xmath9  =  1:1 in the nebula gas - phase , a value compatible with thermochemical calculations in the solar nebula that take into account catalytic effects of fe grains on the kinetics of n@xmath1 to nh@xmath9 conversion ( fegley 2000 ) .",
    "note that ch@xmath9oh is considered to be formed only as a pure condensate in our calculations since , to the best of our knowledge , no experimental data concerning the equilibrium curve of its associated clathrate have been reported in the literature .",

    "it is based on the original ideas of van der waals & platteeuw ( 1959 ) for clathrate formation , which assume that trapping of guest molecules into cages corresponds to the three - dimensional generalization of ideal localized adsorption .",

    "however , this mechanism is not consistent with the fact that pluto and triton possess * n@xmath1-rich ice covers * while they are expected to be formed in the same region as comets .",
    "an alternative possibility would be that comets accreted from planetesimals formed at very low temperature in the disk , but that subsequent radiogenic heating enabled their partial devolatilization through their pores .",
    "in the next section , we explore how radiogenic heating can induce important losses of n@xmath1 in comets after their formation .",

    "this figure shows that , at a given epoch of its evolution and for the adopted set of input parameters , the condition that the temperature profile must be in the 2247 k range can be satisfied in almost the whole body , thus enabling the release of n@xmath1 from this zone .",

    "moreover , if accretion of these bodies were occurring in a cold environment and were slow ",
    "so that radiative removal of the impact heat were effective then triton , pluto and other large kbos could have retained their volatiles and accreted fairly cold ( see discussion by canup & ward ( 2002 ) in the context of the accretion of ganymede and callisto ) .",
