    "study of the local extragalactic velocity field has a considerable history .",
    "rubin ( @xcite ) pinpoints the beginning of the studies concerning deviations from the hubble law to a paper of gamow ( @xcite ) where gamow asked if galaxies partake of a large - scale systematic rotation in addition to the hubble expansion .",
    "the pioneer works by rubin ( @xcite ) and ogorodnikov ( @xcite ) gave evidence that the local extragalactic velocity field is neither linear nor isotropic .",
    "de vaucouleurs ( @xcite ) then interpreted the distribution of bright galaxies and proposed rotation in terms of a flattened local supergalaxy .",
    "this short but remarkable paper did not yet refer to differential expansion , introduced by de vaucouleurs ( @xcite ) as an explanation of the  north - south anisotropy \" which he stated was first pointed out by sandage ( humason et al .",
    "differential expansion was a milder form of hubble s  the law of redshifts does not operate within the local group \" and de vaucouleurs pondered that  in condensed regions of space , such as groups or clusters , the expansion rate is greatly reduced ... \" .",
    "though there was a period of debate on the importance of the kinematic effects claimed by de vaucouleurs and even on the reality of the local supergalaxy ( presently termed as the local supercluster , lsc ) , already for two decades the reality of the differential peculiar velocity field around the virgo cluster has been generally accepted",
    ". however , its amplitude and such details as the deviation from spherical symmetry and possible rotational component , are still under discussion .",
    "a theoretical line of research related to de vaucouleurs differential expansion , has been motivated by the work on density perturbations in friedmann cosmological models , resulting in infall models of matter ( silk @xcite ) which predict a connection between the infall peculiar velocity at the position of the local group towards the virgo cluster and the density parameter of the friedmann universe .",
    "later on , olson & silk ( @xcite ) further developed the formalism in a way which was found useful in teerikorpi et al .",
    "( @xcite ; hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the linearized approximation of peebles ( @xcite ) has been often used for describing the velocity field and for making routine corrections for systemic velocities .    using tolman - bondi model ( tolman @xcite , bondi @xcite )",
    "hoffman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) calculated the expected velocity dispersions along line - of - sight as a function of angular distance from a supercluster and applied the results to virgo .",
    "they derived a gravitating mass of about @xmath12 inside the cone of @xmath13 .",
    "the tolman - bondi ( tb ) model is the simplest inhomogeneous solution to the einstein s field equations .",
    "it describes the time evolution of a spherically symmetric pressure - free dust universe in terms of comoving coordinates . for details of the tb - model cf .",
    "ekholm et al .",
    "( @xcite ; hereafter paper ii ) .    then , following the course of hoffman et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , tully & shaya ( @xcite ) calculated the expected run of radial velocity vs. distance at different angular distances from virgo and for different ( point ) mass - age models .",
    "comparison of such envelope curves with available galaxy data agreed with the point mass having roughly the value of virgo s virial mass ( @xmath14 ) for reasonable friedmann universe ages .    the hubble diagram of tully & shaya contained a small number of galaxies and",
    "did not very well show the expected behaviour . with a larger sample of tully - fisher measured galaxies and attempting to take into account the malmquist bias , teerikorpi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) were able to put in evidence the expected features : an initial steeply rising tight velocity - distance relation , the local maximum in front of virgo and the final ascending part of the relation , expected to approach asymptotically the undisturbed hubble law .",
    "looking from the virgo centre the zero - velocity surface was clearly seen around @xmath15 . using either a continuous mass model or a two - component model , the conclusions of tully & shaya ( @xcite ) were generally confirmed and it was stated that ",
    "various density distributions , constrained by the mass inside the local group distance ( required to produce @xmath16 ) , agree with the observations , but only if the mass within the virgo @xmath13 region is close to or larger than the standard virgo virial mass values .",
    "this is so independently of the value of @xmath17 , of the slope of the density distribution outside of virgo , and of the values adopted for virgo distance and velocity \" .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to use the available sample of galaxies with more accurate distances from cepheids and tully - fisher relation to study the virgocentric velocity field . in paper",
    "ii galaxies with cepheid - distances were used to map the velocity field in front of virgo , here we add galaxies with good tully - fisher distances in order to see both the frontside and backside behaviour and investigate how conclusions of paper i should be modified in the light of new data .",
    "it should be emphasized that also our tully - fisher distances are now better , after a programme to study the slope and the hubble type dependence of the zero - point ( see theureau et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in sect .  2 we shortly review the basics of the use of the direct tully - fisher relation , give the relation to be used and describe our sample and the restrictions put upon it .",
    "in sect .  3",
    "we examine our sample in terms of systemic velocity vs. distance diagrams and see which distance to virgo will bring about best agreement between the tb - predictions and the observations . in sect .",
    "4 we try to answer the question whether we have actually found the virgo cluster at the centre of the tb - metric . in sect .",
    "5 we re - examine our sample from a virgocentric viewpoint and compare our results from the tf - distances with the sample of galaxies with distances from the extragalactic cepheid @xmath5-relation . in sect .",
    "6 we shortly discuss the mass estimate and our density profile and , finally , in sect .",
    "7 we summarize our results with some conclusive remarks .",
    "the absolute magnitude @xmath18 and the logarithm of the maximum rotational velocity @xmath19 of a galaxy ( for which also a shorthand @xmath20 is used ) are related as : @xmath21 the use of this kind of relation as a distance indicator was suggested by gouguenheim ( @xcite ) .",
    "[ e1 ] is known as tully - fisher ( tf ) relation after tully & fisher ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is nowadays widely acknowledged that the distance moduli inferred using eq .",
    "[ e1 ] are underestimated because of selection effects in the sampling .",
    "we can see how this malmquist bias affects the distance determination by considering the _ observed _ average absolute magnitude @xmath22 at each @xmath20 as a function of the true distance @xmath23 .",
    "the limit in apparent magnitude , @xmath24 , cuts off progressively more and more of the distribution function of @xmath18 for a constant @xmath20 .",
    "this means that the _ observed _ mean absolute magnitude @xmath22 is overestimated by the expectation value @xmath25 : @xmath26 this inequality gives a practical measure of the malmquist bias depending primarily on @xmath20 , @xmath23 , @xmath27 and @xmath24 .",
    "the equality holds only when the magnitude limit cuts the luminosity function @xmath28 insignificantly . for our present purposes it is also important to note that for luminous galaxies , which are also fast rotators ( large @xmath20 ) the effect of the magnitude limit is felt at much larger distances than for intrinsically faint galaxies which rotate slowly .",
    "hence by limiting @xmath20 to large values one expects to add to the sample galaxies which suffer very little from the malmquist bias within a restricted distance range . for this kind of bias",
    "the review by teerikorpi ( @xcite ) suggested the name malmquist bias of the @xmath29 kind , in order to make a difference from the classical malmquist bias ( of the @xmath30 kind ) .",
    "following paper i we selected galaxies towards virgo by requiring @xmath19 to be larger than @xmath31 . at the time paper",
    "i was written this value was expected to bring about nearly unbiased tf distance moduli up to twice the virgo distance . with the present , much deeper sample the limit chosen is much safer .",
    "also , we allow an error in b - magnitude to be at maximum @xmath32 .",
    "we also require the axis ratio to be @xmath33 .",
    "because the maximum amplitude of systemic velocities near virgo can be quite large , we first restricted the velocities by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the angular distance from the adopted centre ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) and the cosmological velocity of the centre is following paper ii @xmath38 .",
    "after this the derived tf - distances were restricted by @xmath39 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the calibration of the zero - points was based on a sample of galaxies with cepheid distances given in table  1 in theureau et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "this calibration corresponded to a hubble constant @xmath40 .",
    "finally we comment on our notation on velocities .",
    "we use systemic velocity in the same sense as in paper ii , i.e. the systemic velocity is a combination of the cosmological velocity and the velocity induced by virgo with the assumption that the virgocentric motions dominate . when we refer to observed systemic velocity we call it @xmath41 and when to model prediction , @xmath42 .",
    "if we make no distinction , we use @xmath43 .",
    "in paper ii we found a tb - solution using a simple density law @xmath45 , which fitted data quite well . here",
    "@xmath46 is the distance from the origin of the tb - metric , @xmath47 is the density gradient and @xmath48 the density contrast .",
    "because an einstein - desitter universe was assumed , the background density @xmath49 equals the critical cosmological density , @xmath50 .",
    "the relevant quantity , the mass within a radius @xmath51 , the radius @xmath46 in units of virgo distance , was expressed as @xmath52 ( cf .",
    "eq .  9 in paper ii ) . here @xmath53 is the mass excess within a sphere having a radius of one virgo distance .",
    "unfortunately , the sample of galaxies with distances from the extragalactic cepheid @xmath5-relation did not reach well enough behind the lsc .",
    "our present sample is clearly deep enough to reveal the backside infall signal . in paper",
    "i it was well seen how in the front the differences between different tb - models were not large , in contrast to the background , where the model predictions progressively deviate from each other .    in the formalism developed by ekholm ( @xcite ) and adopted in paper ii , the quantity given by eq .  8 in paper ii , @xmath54 , which is needed for solving the development angle ,",
    "is no longer an explicit function of @xmath55 .",
    "there are  however  still rather many free parameters , which we shortly discuss below :    1 .   the deceleration parameter @xmath17 . in paper",
    "ii we considered @xmath17 given , restricting our analysis to the einstein - desitter universe ( @xmath56 ) . in paper i it was concluded that @xmath17 has a minor influence on the @xmath42 vs. @xmath44 curves and on the virgo mass ( though it has a large effect on total mass inside the lg sphere ) .",
    "2 .   the density gradient @xmath47 and the relative mass excess at @xmath57 , @xmath53 .",
    "we remind that @xmath53 in our formalism does not depend on @xmath47 but only on the amount by which the lg s expansion velocity with respect to centre of lsc has slowed down . in our two - component model ( sect .",
    "5 ) @xmath53 will depend also on @xmath47 .",
    "3 .   the velocities @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . as in papers",
    "i and ii , we presume virgo to be at rest with cosmological background : @xmath61 .",
    "we feel that our choices for the infall velocity of the local group @xmath62 and for the observed velocity of virgo @xmath63 are relatively safe .",
    "we would also like to remind that our solutions in paper ii had an implicit dependence on the hubble constant @xmath55 , because we fixed our distance to virgo kinematically from @xmath64 by adopting @xmath65 .",
    "this _ global _",
    "value was based on sne ia ( lanoix @xcite ) and agrees also with the more local results of the klun ( _ kinematics of the local universe _ ) project ( theureau et al .",
    "@xcite ; ekholm et al .",
    "@xcite ) and with the findings of federspiel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . here",
    "we allow the distance of virgo , or equivalently the hubble constant @xmath55 , vary keeping the cosmological velocity of virgo fixed .",
    "this choice is justified because even though the estimates for @xmath55 have converged to @xmath66 the reported @xmath67 errors are not small and the different values are still scattered ( @xmath68-@xmath69 ) .    in this section",
    "we examine how well the present tb - sample agrees with the model 1 of paper ii , which constitutes of a density excess embedded in a frw universe with @xmath56 and @xmath65 .",
    "the model parameters are @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which predict for the virgo cluster ( @xmath72 ) a mass @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the virial mass of the virgo cluster derived by tully & shaya ( @xcite ) @xmath75 . because of fixed infall velocity of the local group ( lg ) into the centre of lsc and because @xmath55 was fixed from external considerations the distance to centre of lsc became to be @xmath6 . for further details of the tb - model",
