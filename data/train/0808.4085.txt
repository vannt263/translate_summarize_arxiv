    "recent observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies as well as density perturbations in the large - scale structure strongly support the basic predictions of inflationary scenarios , in which primordial adiabatic fluctuations were produced during the accelerated phase of the cosmic expansion and their statistical properties are approximately described by gaussian statistics with a nearly scale - invariant power spectrum ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "some specific inflationary models have been ruled out by observations , narrowing the constraints on the early stage of the universe . with precision measurements from future observations",
    ", we will detect clear signals that help us to discriminate between many candidate of inflationary models .    amongst several signals accessible in the near future , departure from gaussianity",
    "is an important clue to probe the generation mechanism for primordial perturbations as well as to discriminate between inflation models .",
    "while the simplest slow - roll inflation with single scalar field predicts a small departure from gaussianity ( e.g. , @xcite ) , models with a non - trivial kinetic term or late - time inflaton decay called curvaton scenario @xcite can produce a large non - gaussianity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are also viable models motivated by string theory that produce large non - gaussianity such as dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) inflation @xcite and ekyprotic scenario @xcite .",
    "although tentative detections of primordial non - gaussianity have been reported very recently ( @xcite , but see also @xcite ) and the result is broadly consistent with the standard prediction of slow - roll inflation , these detections are at relatively low statistical significance and more precise measurements are necessary for a definite detection of the non - gaussian signals .",
    "planned cmb surveys , namely the planck mission @xcite , will have much greater sensitivity and better detect non - gaussian signals ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "further , large - scale structure data from future spectroscopic surveys will uncover the mass density fluctuations up to giga parsec scales , which preserve the statistical properties of primordial fluctuations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since these two measurements can probe different scales of primordial fluctuations , they are , in principle , complementary to each other .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the signature of primordial non - gaussianity imprinted on the large - scale structure , especially focusing on the matter power spectrum .",
    "naively , we expect that the signature of primordial non - gaussianity basically appears in the statistical properties of higher - order quantities such as the bispectrum and trispectrum , and the power spectrum as a second - order statistic remains unchanged even if large non - gaussianity has been produced .",
    "however , this is true only when the fluctuations of the mass density field are tiny and well within the linear regime .",
    "as the gravitational clustering develops , the coupling between different fourier modes becomes important and the scale - dependent non - linear growth appears due to the mode - coupling effect . in the weakly non - linear regime ,",
    "the strength of this mode - coupling sensitively depends on the initial condition .",
    "since the non - gaussian density field intrinsically possesses non - trivial mode - correlations , the evolution of the power spectrum may be altered by the primordial non - gaussianity , at least in the weakly non - linear regime .    here ,",
    "employing the perturbative calculations , we study the effect of primordial non - gaussianity on the matter power spectrum . the effect of non - gaussianity on the matter power spectrum has been previously investigated by ref.@xcite using perturbation theory , showing that the magnitude of this effect is roughly at the few percent level in the weakly non - linear regime . in this paper , adopting the two representative models of primordial non - gaussianity described in sec .",
    "[ sec : nongaussian_model ] , we quantitatively estimate the non - gaussian effects on the power spectrum and elucidate their shape dependence ( sec .  [ sec : non_gaussianpt ] ) .",
    "in particular , we carefully examine the influence of primordial non - gaussianity on cosmological parameter estimation , paying particular attention to the primordial spectral indices and the characteristic scale of the baryon acoustic oscillations as a cosmic standard ruler ( sec .",
    "[ sec : fisher ] ) . also , we discuss the non - gaussian effect on the galaxy biasing ( sec .",
    "[ sec : galaxy_biasing ] ) .",
    "this issue has been recently studied by several authors in the context of the halo biasing prescription @xcite , and local biasing prescription @xcite . here",
    ", we adopt the local biasing scheme and consider the scale - dependent galaxy biasing arising from the primordial non - gaussianity .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume a flat lambda cold dark matter ( cdm ) model and the fiducial model parameters are chosen based on the five - year wmap results ( wmap+bao+sn ml , see ref.@xcite ) : @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "according to the commonly accepted mechanisms to generate the primordial fluctuations , non - gaussianity would be imprinted on the primordial curvature perturbation produced during inflation .",
    "the curvature perturbation can also be generated after inflation by a late - time decay of light fields , and this would produce a large non - gaussianity in the curvature perturbation .",
    "further , as alternative scenarios to inflation such as ekpyrotic models , nearly scale - invariant curvature perturbation with large non - gaussianity could be generated during the collapsing phase of the universe .",
    "let us denote the primordial curvature perturbation on the uniform density hypersurface and the bardeen s curvature potential at super - horizon scales by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the primordial density perturbation defined at an early time of the matter dominated epoch , @xmath9 , is related to these variables through ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath10 with the function @xmath11 being @xmath12 where the function @xmath13 is the transfer function of matter fluctuations normalized to unity at @xmath14 .",

    ", we consider an equilateral model .",
    "the dbi inflation is a typical example where the bispectrum has a maximum amplitude for equilateral configurations .",
    "this is in contrast with the local model where the bispectrum has the largest amplitude for squeezed configurations @xcite .",

    "note that the bispectrum in equation ( [ eq : bispectrum_eq ] ) is normalized in such a way that , for equilateral configurations ( @xmath37 ) , it coincides with the local form given in equation ( [ eq : bispectrum_local ] ) .",
    "even if the primordial fluctuations are well described by linear theory , the non - linearity of the gravitational dynamics eventually dominates and we must correctly take into account the non - linear growth of matter fluctuations , which significantly modifies the matter power spectrum . for the scales of interest here , especially the accessible scales of future galaxy redshift surveys , the non - linear evolution is rather moderate and perturbative treatment is valid .",
    "the mass density field is described by @xmath38 in the above , the function @xmath39 represents the linear fluctuation and it is given by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the linear growth rate .",
    "neglecting the decaying mode of linear perturbation , the solutions for higher - order quantities are formally expressed as @xcite @xmath42^n \\,\\int\\frac{d^3k_1\\cdots d^3k_n } { ( 2\\pi)^{3(n-1)}}\\,\\delta_{\\rm d}({\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}-{\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}_1-\\cdots-{\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}_n)\\ , f^{(n)}_{\\rm sym}({\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}_1,\\cdots,{\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}_n)\\delta_0({\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}_1)\\cdots\\delta_0({\\mbox{\\boldmath$k$}}_n ) , \\label{eq : pt_sol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath43 being the symmetrized kernel for the @xmath16-th order solution .",
    "then , the power spectrum of the density field , defined as @xmath44 can be calculated by substituting eq.([eq : pt_sol ] ) into the above expression .",
