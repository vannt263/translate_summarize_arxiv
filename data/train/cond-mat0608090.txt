    "albeit it seems obvious  in particular when cooling down  that two contributions add up for this band , the explanations proposed over the years took into account only one single process .",

    "the model taking into account two perpendicular dimers of bedt - ttf molecules successfully describes the mid - infrared peak and emv - coupled features in the room - temperature spectra of the @xmath0-phase salts,@xcite while it does not account for the metallic behavior ; thus it is not able to mimic the appearance of a drude - peak in the compounds with high br content .",

    "as an example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : dimermodel]a we show a fit by the dimer model of the 85 % br compound spectra . for @xmath83 the dimer model with @xmath98  ev and transfer integral term @xmath112  ev can reasonably well predict both the position of the high - frequency electronic maximum l@xmath61 and of the emv - coupled features .",
    "the value of the transfer integral energy is somewhat lower than those received by the hckel method : @xmath113  ev.@xcite taking into account the very different approaches of these methods , the agreement is quite good .",
    "the differential spectrum of the experimentally obtained conductivity and the calculations by the dimer model shows that the intradimer transition is responsible for nearly all the intensity of the emv - coupled features . with other words , in the low - temperature metallic state",
    "the intradimer transition interacts strongly with the totally symmetric vibrations , while this process is less important for the charge transfer between the dimers .    in order to identify the intradimer transition band for polarization @xmath66 ,",
    "we start with the respective parameters obtained for the @xmath54 .",
    "only the position of the intradimer charge transfer is varied by changing the transfer integral b1 until the positions of emv - coupled features , which are considerably softer along @xmath7 axis , match the experiment .",
    "consequently , the position of the intradimer transition follows these emv - coupled vibrations .",
    "the fit with @xmath114  ev suggests that the l@xmath61 has its maximum at about 2900  in the @xmath7 direction , compared to 3300  found for @xmath83 .    for a further analysis of the data focused on itinerant charge carriers ,",
    "we subtract the results of the cluster - model calculations from the experimental data . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dimermodel ] , the remaining intensity of the emv - coupled vibrational modes is small ; this confirms that they are only very weakly coupled to charge carriers which are not localized on the dimers .",
    "interestingly , this is only true for the metallic samples with high br content ( 85%  and 90% ) .",
    "once we approach the insulating side of the phase diagram ( low br concentration ) , a charge transfer only in a dimer does not account for all the intensity of the emv - coupled features anymore .",
    "these spectra are much closer to those proposed by the tetramer model,@xcite indicating that once the inter - dimer excitations get localized they are also coupled to the totally - symmetric vibrations of bedt - ttf molecule .",
    "one of the striking features of the @xmath0-phase spectra is the anisotropy , which from the first glance one would not expect on an orthorhombic unit cell@xcite with two crystallographically identical dimers and an angle between the optical axes and the dimers close to 45 degrees .",
    "this anisotropy involves the intradimer transition , and above we showed that the cluster model gives a good explanation for the anisotropy in the vibrational features .",
    "it should be noted that the distance between the dimers is different in @xmath7 and @xmath8 direction , with some preference along the @xmath7 axis , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : kappapattern1 ] .",
    "in addition , the molecules are not standing upright on the ( @xmath29 ) plane , but considerably tilted in @xmath7 direction ( in an alternating fashion in such a way that adjacent layers form a herring - bone pattern).@xcite the higher reflectivity observed in the e  @xmath115 a polarization in these compounds suggests that a projection of the dipole moment for all the electronic transitions onto this axis is higher .",
    "an explanation for the difference in position and intensity of the intradimer charge transfer band l@xmath61 observed parallel to @xmath7 and @xmath8 axes might be given by a so - called davydov splitting.@xcite . in the present case of the @xmath0-salts ,",
    "the dimers are taken as the principal unit , i.e.a ` big molecule ' with one hole and spin residing on it .",
    "in general , if the unit cell possesses a center of symmetry and two identical molecules in the cell , a davydov splitting of the intra - molecular electronic transitions between the upper molecular orbitals ( intra - molecular excitons , frenkel excitons ) is observed.@xcite in this case two bands which are distinct in position and intensity are expected parallel to the symmetry axes of the unit cell .",
    "applied to the present case , the electronic spectrum exhibits two distinct bands for the two polarizations parallel to the symmetry axes of the unit cell .",
    "thus , the anisotropy of the intradimer transition can be considered as a davydov splitting of the dimer excitation .",
    "indeed , the less symmetrical ( monoclinic ) @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1hg(scn)@xmath116 ( @xmath15=cl , br ) show less anisotropy of the spectra@xcite than the presented orthorhombic compounds .      from the analysis presented above ,",
    "we conclude that the lower - frequency contribution l@xmath62 to the mid - infrared band originates from excitations across the mott - hubbard gap which allows us to determine the effective coulomb repulsion  to be approximately 2200  .",
    "this assignment is supported by comparing our data to spectra of the superconductor @xmath0-(bedt - tsef)@xmath117hg@xmath118br@xmath119 .",
    "the replacement of the four inner sulphur atoms with selenium reduces the on - site coulomb repulsion but increases the transfer integrals to neighboring molecules .",
    "therefore , the bedt - tsef - based analogs are much closer to the normal metallic state ; the contributions of itinerant and localized charge carriers are well separated in the optical spectra .",
    "it has clearly been observed@xcite that with decreasing temperatures the contribution of the electrons in the conduction band ( drude - peak and transitions between hubbard bands ) shifts to lower frequencies while there is a blue shift of the excitations of the localized charge carriers , similar to the metallic compounds studied in this work .",
    "calculations by merino and mckenzie@xcite reveal that in strongly correlated metals the coupling between electrons and phonons leads to a non - monotonic temperature dependence of the vibrational modes near the coherence temperature @xmath120 .",
    "the shift is most pronounced ( up to 5% ) for phonons in the energy range comparable to @xmath78 , and becomes weaker for larger or smaller frequencies .",
    "raman measurements perfectly agree with these predictions.@xcite evidently , the situation is more complicated for infrared data , as the vibrations are activated only by emv - coupling and influence in frequency and intensity by the charge excitations within the dimers",
    ". nevertheless , this electron - phonon coupling might be an explanation for a softening of @xmath121 and @xmath122 below @xmath21  k for the compounds  with @xmath6 and 40% where the electronic correlations @xmath19 are strongest .",
    "a close inspection reveals that the higher frequency mode @xmath94 exhibits a similar behavior for the insulating samples with low br content , but weaker ; while no change is observed for the far - infrared vibration @xmath123 .",
    "this also suggests that the effective coulomb repulsion  is of the order of 2000 to 2500  .",
    "our comprehensive analysis of the temperature- and br - concentration dependence of mid - infrared and emv - coupled features in @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath124cu[n(cn)@xmath2br@xmath3cl@xmath4 allows us to distinguish two contributions in the mid - infrared part of the spectra .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the calculations which describe a charge transfer in a dimer and its coupling to the totally symmetric vibrations of bedt - ttf molecule . the higher frequency l@xmath61 band ( 3300  for the polarization @xmath83 and presumably around 2900  for @xmath66 ) originates from the charge transfer between the bedt - ttf molecules in dimers .",
    "this charge - transfer within the dimers is coupled to the intramolecular vibrations of bedt - ttf and is responsible for the major part of the emv - coupled features intensity for the metallic compounds , while in the insulating materials the lower - frequency contribution is presumably also coupled with vibrations . the lower - frequency contribution to the mid - infrared band l@xmath62 located at 2200",
    "is isotropic and assigned to transition between two hubbard bands which form due to strong electronic correlations .",

    "<S> infrared reflection measurements of the half - filled two - dimensional organic conductors @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu[n(cn)@xmath2br@xmath3cl@xmath4 were performed as a function of temperature ( @xmath5  k ) and br - substitution ( @xmath6 , 40% , 73% , 85% , and 90% ) in order to study the metal - insulator transition . </S>",
    "<S> we can distinguish absorption processes due to itinerant and localized charge carriers . </S>",
    "<S> the broad mid - infrared absorption has two contributions : transitions between the two hubbard bands and intradimer excitations from the charges localized on the ( bedt - ttf)@xmath1 dimer . since the latter couple to intramolecular vibrations of bedt - ttf </S>",
    "<S> , the analysis of both electronic and vibrational features provides a tool to disentangle these contributions and to follow their temperature and electronic - correlations dependence . </S>",
    "<S> calculations based on the cluster model support our interpretation . </S>"
