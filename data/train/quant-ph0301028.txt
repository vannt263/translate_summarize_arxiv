    "secret sharing ( ss ) is an important cryptosystem protocol for dealing secret information to a set of players , not all of whom can be trusted @xcite .",
    "the encoded secret can only be replicated ( or , equivalently , reconstructed  @xcite ) if certain subsets of players collaborate , and these subsets are referred to as the access structure .",
    "the remaining subsets comprise the adversary structure , and the protocol denies the adversary structure any information about the secret .",
    "the underpinning scheme for arbitrary ss is @xmath0-threshold ss , which involves @xmath1 players , and any subset of  @xmath2 players constitutes a valid set in the access structure ; other ss schemes can be constructed via threshold ss , for example by distributing unequal numbers of shares to players .",
    "although quantum secret sharing ( qss ) was first introduced as a method to transmit classical information in a hostile environment with quantum - enhanced security @xcite , qss was subsequently established @xcite as a quantum analogue to shamir s secret sharing described above and we use the term qss to refer to the latter approach .",
    "qss provides a valuable protocol in quantum communication but also is important as an error correction scheme @xcite .",
    "here we are concerned with continuous - variable ( cv ) qss  @xcite .",
    "quantum information protocols and tasks are now studied both as discrete - variable , qubit - based ( or qudit - based ) protocols and tasks  @xcite and as cv realizations  @xcite .",
    "cv quantum information protocols are generally realized in optical systems and exploit advanced quantum optics tools , such as the generation of squeezed light @xcite and ability to count single photons @xcite , as well as the low rate of decoherence for optical systems .",
    "the recent demonstration of cv unconditional quantum teleportation @xcite is an excellent example of the capabilities of cv quantum information processes in optical systems .",
    "moreover , the technology for this cv quantum teleportation is not very different from the techniques required for cv qss .",
    "the original proposal for cv qss @xcite established a general method for cv qss , and for @xmath0-threshold schemes in particular , using interferometry involving passive optical elements ( mirrors , beam splitters and phase shifters ) , active elements ( squeezers ) and homodyne detectors .",
    "a @xmath3-threshold scheme was proposed involving a single squeezer , thereby suggesting an experiment that is within the reach of current technology  @xcite .",
    "the original proposal of how to perform the general @xmath0 scheme was complicated , though , by the need for an increasing number of squeezers in the interferometer .",
    "a practical realization of threshold - qss would need to minimize the number of optical squeezers as the number of players increases .",
    "here we establish that , for any number of players @xmath1 and any threshold level @xmath2 for the number of collaborators to be in the access structure , the total number of squeezers needed by the collaborating players does not exceed two .",
    "this remarkable result informs us that at most two squeezers are required for an arbitrary number of players @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , to replicate the secret state , the collaborating players require access to an interferometer with @xmath2 channels but only two active components ( i.e. , squeezers ) .",
    "this analysis also allows us to determine the total amount of squeezing required in a two - squeezer threshold qss protocol : the analysis is important because the degree of squeezing required for the protocol can be regarded as an effective cost for the procedure @xcite .",
    "the second major concern of this paper is the extent to which it is possible to achieve the goals of the cv qss protocol with finite physical resources . for the protocol to work",
    "perfectly , the dealer needs access to ancillary states prepared with infinite squeezing ; as this is not physically possible , we analyze the effects of finite squeezing , which imposes limitations on the fidelity of the replicated secret state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ threshold ] we summarize the cv qss protocol for threshold schemes . in section  [ weakening ] we describe efficient replication of the secret state , which requires the minimal number of squeezing elements and minimal overall squeezing .",
    "the total amount of squeezing is discussed in section  [ total ] and we conclude in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "the optical @xmath0 threshold scheme is sketched in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] .",
    "a dealer holds a pure secret state @xmath4 realized in a single mode of the electromagnetic field and encodes the secret as an @xmath1-mode entangled state @xmath5 by mixing with @xmath6 ancillary modes in an @xmath1-channel active interferometer , where the term active refers to one or two  mode squeezers  @xcite .",
    "the dealer then sends one output , or `` share '' , to each of the players , and at least @xmath2 players must combine their shares in an active interferometer to replicate the secret state .",
    "however , the no - cloning theorem  @xcite requires that no threshold scheme exists for @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "also any threshold scheme with @xmath8 can be obtained from the @xmath9 scheme by discarding @xmath10 shares .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on the @xmath9 threshold scheme .",
    "the secret is a state @xmath11 with wave function @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath13 be the tensor product of @xmath14 copies of @xmath15 , one copy of which is owned by each player .",
    "the idea is to entangle the information among states of @xmath13 such that any @xmath2 players can cooperate to untangle the information but any smaller number is unable to do so .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath13 is the space @xmath16 of square integrable wave functions on @xmath17 .",
    "thus , if @xmath18 denotes the linear space of coordinate functions for @xmath17 , then choosing a system of euclidean coordinates @xmath19 for any vector @xmath20 is equivalent to picking an orthonormal basis @xmath21 for @xmath18 such that @xmath22 we denote the inner product of these coordinate functions by @xmath23 .",
    "suppose the dealer starts with an unentangled tensor product @xmath24 of the secret state @xmath4 , with @xmath25 copies of a state @xmath26 and @xmath25 copies of a state @xmath27 , where @xmath28 write this state @xmath29 where @xmath30    the dealer then entangles the secret state by a linear canonical point transformation @xmath31 in which the orthogonal ( euclidean ) coordinate functions @xmath32 are replaced by a general linear system @xmath33 for which @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding unitary transformation of @xmath13 then maps the state @xmath5 to @xmath35 for it to be possible for any subset of @xmath2 players to reconstruct the secret state , certain conditions must be respected .",
    "these conditions become apparent when we consider the replication algorithm .      in replicating the secret state ,",
    "it is convenient to identify three subspaces of coordinates ; i.e. , express @xmath18 as a direct sum of three mutually orthogonal subspaces @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the one - dimensional space spanned by @xmath38 , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the @xmath41-dimensional spaces spanned , respectively , by @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "thus , we relabel the @xmath44 coordinates as @xmath45 coordinates with @xmath46 the wave function @xmath47 is then @xmath48    it will be understood in the following that all @xmath1 players know the encoding transformation in which @xmath49 .",
    "we then impose the requirement that this transformation is such that the components of any @xmath2 basis vectors of the set @xmath50 that lie in the subspace @xmath51 are linearly independent and hence span this subspace .    without loss of generality",
    ", we may suppose that the first @xmath2 players form the collaborating set .",
    "these players are able to make any transformation of the states in the subset of hilbert spaces accessible to them .",
    "however , we will restrict the transformations they can make to those corresponding to general linear coordinate transformations , as defined above .",

    "the situation is similar to cv quantum teleportation @xcite , where an ideal epr pair ( which is a two - mode infinitely squeezed vacuum ) is required for the protocol to work perfectly .",
    "however , with some loss of fidelity the scheme can be adapted to a realistic , finite - squeezing situation @xcite . in cv qss ,",
    "finite squeezing implies that the secret state can only be approximately replicated because there is entanglement between the secret state and the shares in both the access structure and the adversary structure , which limits the fidelity of the replicated state with respect to the original secret state . also entanglement with the adversarial shares",
