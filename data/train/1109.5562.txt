    "the efficient and reliable detection of the quantum mechanical state of a nanoscale system is a key component of all present designs of quantum circuits.@xcite one nondestructive readout scheme currently in use for the important class of superconducting flux qubits is based on a heterodyne detection of the dynamic response of a dc superconducting quantum interference device ( dc - squid ) detector which is inductively coupled to the qubit .",
    "@xcite thereby , the dc - squid is operated in its linear regime as a shunted variable inductor in a resonant circuit . in this set - up , its resonance frequency depends on the magnetic flux generated by the qubit being in the ground or excited state .",
    "hence , measuring the impedance of the resonant circuit as a function of an externally applied bias current yields two characteristic lorentzian resonances at two different resonance frequencies , which depend on the two qubit states .",
    "this detection scheme , hence , allows us to infer the state of the qubit from the resonant response of the detector in the nanocircuit . in order",
    "that a reliable discrimination of the two qubit states becomes possible in this continuous type of readout design , the probability distributions for the readout values have to be only weakly overlapping . due to thermal and quantum fluctuations , the readout naturally is a random process,@xcite and the noise properties of the nanocircuit around the detector resonances determine the discrimination power of the set - up .",
    "an alternative readout scheme is the josephson bifurcation amplifier.@xcite it is based on a classical driven nonlinear resonator and exploits the classical bifurcation point of the dynamically induced bistability with a small- and a large - oscillation state.@xcite the response ( or output ) of the nonlinear resonator around the bifurcation point is very sensitive to small changes in the circuit parameters .",
    "this is an ideal prerequisite for a sensitive detector .",
    "depending on the state of the qubit to be sensed , the resonator bifurcation point is shifted to a different frequency , allowing for large discrimination powers between the large- and small - oscillation detector state of up to @xmath0.@xcite nevertheless , since the detector is a classical macroscopic device , it introduces considerable dephasing and relaxation to the qubit state , yielding a reduced contrast of the qubit rabi oscillations of less than @xmath1.@xcite this implies that the thermal noise properties of the nonlinear detector ( together with semiclassical corrections due to quantum fluctuations ) around the classical bifurcation point determine the discrimination power between the two states close to the classical bifurcation point .",
    "@xcite hence , it would be desirable to combine the advantage of a large discrimination power of a nonlinear detector with the reduced noise sensitivity of a nanocircuit operated close to the quantum regime .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a combination of both strategies and propose a nonlinear detector scheme in the form of a nonlinear resonator with an amplitude modulated drive in its few - photon deep quantum regime . in particular , in this regime , we shall exploit sharp multiphoton resonances in the nonlinear resonator , @xcite which are induced by the external driving field close to the fundamental resonator frequency .",
    "they can be used for the detection of the states of the qubit and offer the advantage of being rather sharp and externally tunable by varying the parameters of the external drive .",
    "the concept is an extension of the case of a linear resonator , where the fundamental resonance frequency is shifted depending on the qubit state .",
    "however , the multiphoton resonances in the nonlinear detector close to the detector s fundamental frequency show very small line widths .",
    "the width of the @xmath2-photon resonance is determined by the corresponding @xmath2-photon rabi frequency , which decreases with increasing photon number .",
    "the sharp resonance lines , in turn , offer the advantage that only a few measurement cycles are necessary to ensure a large discrimination power . to understand the back action of the nonlinear multiphoton detector on the qubit state",
    ", we determine the relaxation rate of the qubit due to the coupling to the driven dissipative nonlinear oscillator around a multiphoton resonance .",
    "notably , the back action of the resonator on the qubit is sufficiently weak , yielding to a good qubit - state measurement fidelity .",
    "furthermore , we show that the discrimination power of the set - up is rather large and beyond @xmath0 for our choice of realistic parameters of a flux qubit circuit .",
    "in fact , it gives rise to an enhanced measurement fidelity as compared to the linear parametric oscillator .",
    "furthermore , we show that the nonlinear multiphoton detector does not have a worse measurement efficiency as compared to the linear detector scheme .",
    "we determine the measurement efficiency of the set - up via the ratio of the time it takes to collect enough information on the qubit state ( measurement time ) and the relaxation time .",
    "it turns out that the measurement efficiency does not considerably decrease as compared to the linear case .",
    "hence , the detection scheme indeed has the advantage of an overall reduced back action in combination with an enhanced discrimination power , together with a sufficiently large measurement efficiency .",
    "an experimental realization of a driven nonlinear resonator in its few - photon quantum regime is in principle possible with present set - ups and technology . in a recent experiment,@xcite",
    "a nanoscale superconducting microwave resonator has been driven to its nonlinear regime by fast frequency - chirped voltage pulses . at low enough temperature",
    ", the regime of quantum noise has been reached . in this experiment ,",
    "the applied driving strength has been rather large , which corresponds to a large photon number transferred to the resonator .",
    "no particular few - photon resonances have been revealed and the nonlinear response is similar to previous schemes on classical bifurcation detectors using a time - dependent driving frequency.@xcite .",
    "however , the route to the few - photon regime seems to be clear .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we start from a typical experimental setup for the flux qubit and its squid detector and we derive the hamiltonian model .",
    "this serves to motivate an experimental realization of our proposed detection scheme .",

    "then , in sec.[sec : backqubit ] we determine the back action of the driven dissipative detector on the qubit dynamics by analyzing the population difference of the qubit states at the multiphoton transitions in the detector . furthermore , we determine the measurement efficiency in sec .",
    "[ sec : queff ] .",
    "in order to relate the theoretical approach in the following to realistic devices , we start by deriving the model from standard set - ups already realized in experiments . for this , we use a typical architecture of a persistent current qubit which is inductively coupled to a driven squid .",
    "we consider the experimental set - up used in ref .   for the qubit , consisting of a superconducting loop interrupted by three josephson junctions , two of which have equal josephson energies , while the coupling energy of the third is smaller , in order to yield a double - well potential configuration . in this low - inductance circuit ,",
    "the flux through the loop remains close to the externally applied value @xmath3 .",

    "in the energy eigenbasis , the hamiltonian follows as @xmath17 , with @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the corresponding pauli matrix with @xmath20 .",

    "the qubit and the squid are coupled by means of their mutual inductance @xmath41.@xcite thereby , the squid induces the flux @xmath42 in the qubit loop , where @xmath43 is the circulating current in the squid .",
    "the latter can be determined by using current conservation in the loop and the josephson relations for the two junctions in the squid . for the symmetric",
    "squid,@xcite it follows that @xmath44 .",
    "thus , the total magnetic flux in the qubit is affected by its coupling with the squid , and it is composed of the external flux and the squid - generated contribution , i.e. , @xmath45 .",
    "this implies that the energy bias of the qubit acquires a contribution that depends on the circulating current in the squid , leading to the effective asymmetry @xmath46 , where @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , two sources of noise can affect the qubit dynamics , i.e. , the fluctuations from the external flux @xmath3 and from the bias current @xmath48 in the squid,@xcite which is related to @xmath38 by the josephson equation @xmath49 . by tuning the bias current to the critical value @xmath50 characterized by @xmath51 ,",
    "the influence from current fluctuations in the squid can be minimized @xcite and the optimal working point is reached . for a nonsymmetric squid , the lowest - order contribution is linear in @xmath52,@xcite while in the symmetric case this lowest - order contribution vanishes , which implies that around the optimal working point the phase @xmath38 is very small , @xmath53 . in the following ,",

    "similarly , the interaction hamiltonian in terms of ladder operators reads as @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "notice that @xmath69 and @xmath70 depend on the external flux @xmath71 , i.e. , they are tunable in a limited regime with respect to the desired oscillator frequency @xmath72 , where the coupling term is considered as a perturbation to the squid ( @xmath73 ) , in order to keep the dynamics of the oscillator to dominate .",

    "on the other hand , the qubit - detector coupling should be large enough so that an efficient detection of the qubit state becomes possible . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] and will be quantitatively discussed in the sequel of this paper , this can indeed be achieved for realistic parameters .",
    "moreover , the choice of the parameter regime also justifies us to restrict the influence of the resonator coupling on the effective qubit bias to lowest order in @xmath38 only .",
    "eventually , the total system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath85 .",
    "before we address the dynamics of the detection scheme based on the nonlinear response of the duffing oscillator to the applied periodic driving in the stationary regime , we discuss the coherent dynamics generated by @xmath86 , which is periodic in time .    here",

    "we note that an analytic expression for the multi - photon resonances would follow from a van - vleck perturbative approach in a similar manner as for the pure quantum duffing oscillator.@xcite however , the resulting expression will be cumbersome and not further illuminating for the present purpose .",
    "we note , furthermore , that the qubit - detector interaction occurs via a parametric coupling @xmath104 , and via a two - photon coupling @xmath105 .",

    "we note that , in the same way , the direct coupling of the qubit to the electromagnetic fluctuations could be included .",

    ".    an important feature of a detection scheme is that it is efficient in discriminating the states to be detected .",
    "this can be quantified by the discrimination power of the detector , which can be defined for our case as @xmath186 the result for @xmath184 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( b ) .",
    "the discrimination power shows a rich structure of local maxima and minima , which indicates that it can be tuned directly by tuning the driving frequency .",
    "it is moreover important to realize that the discrimination power can be optimized by tuning @xmath69 . in the optimized case ,",
    "a local maximum of the multiphoton resonance for one qubit state can be made to coincide with a local minimum of the response for the opposite qubit state yielding to a maximal discrimination power .",
    "an example where the discrimination power has been optimized with respect to the three - photon resonance is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( b ) .",
    "another important prerequisite for a useful detection scheme is that the coupling of the qubit to the detector around a multiphoton resonance does not generate a destructive back action on the qubit dynamics . in this section ,",
    "we show that the back action in this design is surprisingly small for a realistic choice of parameters .",
    "the back action of the detector on the qubit arises in the form of two contributions from the coupling .",
    "first , this coupling has a parametric component @xmath187 , which commutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "thus , in the presence of a coupling of the oscillator to the bath , this term only produces dephasing and no relaxation , as it is , for instance , required for a quantum non - demolition measurement .",
    "this part guarantees an efficient detection of the qubit state .",
    "the second component @xmath188 in the coupling term yields transitions in the qubit when two - photon processes are induced in the detector by the external driving and/or by dissipative transition . since",
    ", at low temperature , dissipation is dominated by photon leaking and the driving is very weak , the decay rate of the qubit from its excited state to its ground state accompanied by the emission of two oscillators photons , largely exceeds the excitation rate from the ground state to the excited state accompanied by the absorption of two photons originally coming from the bath or the driving . on the other hand , when the effective oscillator frequency is close to a multiphoton resonance , photon absorption in the coupled system is enhanced and thus the asymptotic qubit population might be reduced .",
    "thus , for a large asymmetry @xmath189 , peaks and dips in the qubit population difference @xmath190 are expected when multiphoton transitions in the detector are induced .",
    "this is what is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , where @xmath190 is shown for several values of @xmath152 . for an easier orientation ,",
    "we show in addition the corresponding stationary nonlinear response of the detector in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) . for increasing driving ,",
    "the deviation from the expected value @xmath191 becomes more pronounced for larger photon numbers @xmath2 and larger driving @xmath152 .",
    "the reason is that , for increasing driving , a larger rabi frequency for the corresponding transition results [ see eq .",
    "( [ rabi ] ) ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , it follows that when the qubit is prepared in its ground state @xmath182 ( we consider @xmath163 ) the back action is very small .",
    "the impact is less than @xmath192 for the considered realistic parameters , yielding to a readout contrast of more than @xmath0 .",
    "this has to be compared with presently achievable readout contrasts of less than @xmath1 , @xcite which results from an architecture with a classical josephson bifurcation amplifier .",
    "in passing , we note that the detector response can also be calculated from the stationary solution of the master equation ( [ fme ] ) , but for the parameters considered here ( in particular because of the large qubit bias ) , this coincides with the shifted one .",
    "moreover , we note that the components @xmath193 and @xmath194 can be tuned by @xmath195 and @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , @xmath196 can in principle be eliminated by setting @xmath197 , which would imply that the measurement scheme keeps the state of the qubit without any relaxation but only pure dephasing ( ideal quantum nondemolition measurement ) . however",
    ", turning off the splitting implies a major change in the experimental design of the sample , since this parameter is determined by the josephson energy in the junctions of the superconducting flux qubit and , thus , may not be easy to be realized .     of the qubit states , and ( b ) the corresponding detector response @xmath150 as a function of the external frequency @xmath198 for the same parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig4],width=302 ]    the back action of the detector on the qubit should be small not only when the qubit is in its ground state but also when it is in its excited state .",

    "the fact that information on the qubit state is acquired in the detector via the same channel by which dissipation is introduced is nicely reflected in the expression of the relaxation rate in eq.([relaxrate ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) , the relaxation rate @xmath156 is shown for a large negative asymmetry in the qubit",
    ". the relaxation rate is strongly peaked around the multiphoton transitions .",
    "there , the noise from the detector absorbs more energy from the qubit around the multiphoton transition @xmath153 since the parametric component @xmath193 of the coupling becomes negligible , leading to a dominant relaxation process induced by @xmath194 .",
    "we emphasize that although the relaxation is maximally enhanced at a multiphoton resonance , the absolute value of @xmath156 is still very small in comparison to the damping constant , e.g. , @xmath204 .",
    "thus , we can infer the qubit state with sufficient precision by operating the detector in its steady state regime as it has been assumed in section [ nobackaction ] .",
    "the measurement of the qubit state requires a coupling to the outer world , which clearly introduces noise to the qubit . in turn , the noisy detector yields measurement results , which are statistically distributed .",
    "this implies that several measurements have to be performed to obtain a reliable statistics .",
    "hence , the relaxation time of the qubit state should not only exceed the typical relaxation time of the detector but also the time it takes to acquire sufficient information to infer the qubit state ( the measurement time @xmath205 ) .",
    "hence , for a good measurement fidelity , @xmath206 should be smaller than the characteristic time @xmath171 given by eq . , or , @xmath207 .",
    "the measurement time can be formalized @xcite as the ratio of the symmetrized power spectrum @xmath208 of the phase operator @xmath38 ( evaluated at zero frequency ) and the square of the difference between the two expectation values of @xmath38 when the qubit is in the two opposite states , i.e. , with eq .",

    "this should be contrasted to the measurement time of @xmath212 ns obtained in ref .  .",

    ", the efficiency also shows local maxima . for the discrimination power being optimized around the three - photon resonance ,",
    "the measurement efficiency displays a clear local maximum [ see fig . [ fig5](c ) ] . due to the small size of the relaxation rate @xmath156 of the detector ,",
    "the overall measurement efficiency is rather large in comparison to the detection set - up with a linear resonator , @xcite ensuring @xmath207 .     of the nonlinear quantum detector , ( b ) the measurement time @xmath205 , and ( c ) the measurement efficiency @xmath215 as a function of the external frequency @xmath132 .",

    "to conclude , we have introduced a scheme for quantum state detection on the basis of a nonlinear detector which is operated in the regime of resonant few - photon transitions .",
    "discrete multiphoton resonances in the detector can be used to infer the state of the parametrically coupled qubit via a state - dependent frequency shift of the detector s nonlinear response function .",

    "furthermore , we have shown that the sharpness of the multiphoton resonances can be used to obtain an increased discrimination power as compared to the linear parametric detection scheme .",
    "clearly , the relaxation rate at a multiphoton resonance for the qubit becomes maximal , but in general remains very small .",
    "the measurement time around a multiphoton resonance can be tuned such that it becomes minimal . for realistic experimental parameters ,",
    "we find surprisingly small measurement times , allowing in principle for fast measurements .",
    "moreover , the efficiency of the measurement , which takes the time to acquire enough information to infer the qubit state into account , also assumes large values , thus allowing for a reliable and highly efficient measurement of the qubit state .",
    "we have chosen realistic values for the involved model parameters such that an experimental realization of this quantum measurement scheme should become possible in the near future .",
    "the nonlinear detection scheme in the deep few - photon quantum regime offers thus the advantage of an increased discrimination power of more than @xmath0 ( for our choice of realistic parameters ) , as compared to previous classical detection schemes based on the josephson bifurcation amplifier .    a possible setup in order to realize the nonlinear few - photon detector could be the architecture used in a recent experiment.@xcite the low - temperature regime , where quantum noise effects are important ,",
    "has already been reached . in order to operate in the regime of only few photons in the resonator , the sensitivity and stability of the devices might have still to be further increased .",
