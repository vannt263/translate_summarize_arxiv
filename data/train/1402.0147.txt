    "recent times , the notion of probabilistic robustness @xcite , has emerged as an attractive alternative to classical worst - case robust control framework .",
    "there are two key driving factors behind this development . *",
    "first * , it is well - known @xcite that the deterministic modeling of uncertainty in the worst - case framework leads to conservative performance guarantees . in particular , from a probabilistic viewpoint , classical robustness margins can be expanded significantly while keeping the risk level acceptably small @xcite . *",
    "second * , the classical robustness formulation often leads to problems with enormous computational complexity @xcite , and in practice , relies on relaxation techniques for solution .",
    "probabilistic robustness formulation offers a promising alternative to address these challenges . instead of the interval - valued structured uncertainty descriptions",
    ", it adopts a risk - aware perspective to analyze robustness , and hence , explicitly accounts the distributional information associated with unstructured uncertainty .",
    "furthermore , significant progress have been made in the design and analysis of randomized algorithms @xcite for computations related to probabilistic robustness .",
    "these recent developments are providing impetus to a transition from  worst - case \" to  distributional robustness \" @xcite .      in order to fully leverage the potential of distributional robustness",
    ", the associated computation must be scalable and of high accuracy . however , numerical implementation of most probabilistic methods rely on monte carlo like realization - based algorithms , leading to high computational cost for implementing them to nonlinear systems .",
    "in particular , the accuracy of robustness computation depends on the numerical accuracy of histogram - based ( piecewise constant ) approximation of the probability density function ( pdf ) that evolves spatio - temporally over the joint state and parameter space , under the action of closed - loop nonlinear dynamics .",
    "nonlinearities at trajectory level cause non - gaussianity at pdf level , even when the initial uncertainty is gaussian . thus , in monte carlo approach , at any given time , a high - dimensional nonlinear system requires a dense grid to sufficiently resolve the non - gaussian pdf , incurring the ` curse of dimensionality ' @xcite .",
    "this is a serious bottleneck in applications like flight control software certification @xcite , where the closed loop dynamics is nonlinear , and linear robustness analysis supported with monte carlo , remains the state - of - the art .",
    "lack of nonlinear robustness analysis tools , coupled with the increasing complexity of flight control algorithms , have caused loss of several f / a-18 aircrafts due to nonlinear ",

    "optimization - based _",
    "deterministic _ nonlinear robustness analysis @xcite depends on the quality of semi - algebraic approximation , and is still computationally expensive for large - scale nonlinear systems .",
    "thus , there is a need for controller robustness verification methods , that does not make any structural assumption on nonlinearity , and allows scalable computation while accommodating stochastic uncertainty .",
    "building on our earlier work @xcite , we show that stochastic initial condition and parametric uncertainties can be propagated through the closed - loop nonlinear dynamics _ in exact arithmetic_. this is achieved by leveraging the fact that the transfer operator governing the evolution of joint densities , is an infinite - dimensional _ linear _ operator , even though the underlying finite - dimensional closed - loop dynamics is _",
    "nonlinear_. hence , we directly solve the linear transfer operator equation subject to the nonlinear dynamics .",
    "this crucial step distinguishes the present work from other methods for probabilistic robustness computation by explicitly using the exact values of the joint pdf instead of empirical estimates of it .",
    "thus , from a statistical perspective , the robustness verification method proposed in this paper , is an _ ensemble formulation _ as opposed to the _ sample formulations _",
    "available in the literature @xcite .",
    "based on monge - kantorovich optimal transport @xcite , we propose a novel framework for computing probabilistic robustness as the  distance \" on information space . in this formulation",
    ", we measure robustness as the minimum effort required to transport the probability mass from instantaneous joint state pdf to a reference state pdf . for comparing regulation performance of controllers with stochastic initial conditions",
    ", the reference state pdf is dirac distribution at trim . if in addition , parametric uncertainties are present , then the optimal transport takes place on the extended state space with the reference pdf being a degenerate distribution at trim value of states .",
    "we show that the optimal transport computation is meshless , non - parametric and computationally efficient .",

    "[ logrho ] , we plot the time evolution of the peak value of lqr joint state pdf , and compare that with the joint state pdf values along the lqr closed - loop trajectories that do nt converge to @xmath30 by @xmath23 s. fig .",

    "[ minmax ] , _ top row _ ) , there are transient performance mismatch between lqr and gslqr , for approximately 38 s.              from a systems - control perspective , instead of performing an _ elaborate qualitative _ statistical analysis as above , one would like to have a _ concise and quantitative _ robustness analysis tool , enabling the inferences of section v.a.2 and v.a.3 .",
    "we now illustrate that the wasserstein distance introduced in section iv.b , serves this purpose .    in this formulation ,",

    "[ logrho ] and [ minmax ] .",

    "<S> this paper presents a new framework for controller robustness verification with respect to f-16 aircraft s closed - loop performance in longitudinal flight . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the state regulation performance of a linear quadratic regulator ( lqr ) and a gain - scheduled linear quadratic regulator ( gslqr ) , applied to nonlinear open - loop dynamics of f-16 , in presence of stochastic initial condition and parametric uncertainties , as well as actuator disturbance . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in presence of initial condition uncertainties alone , both lqr and gslqr have comparable immediate and asymptotic performances , but the gslqr exhibits better transient performance at intermediate times . </S>",
    "<S> this remains true in the presence of additional actuator disturbance . </S>",
    "<S> also , gslqr is shown to be more robust than lqr , against parametric uncertainties . the probabilistic framework proposed here , leverages transfer operator based density computation in exact arithmetic and introduces optimal transport theoretic performance validation and verification ( v&v ) for nonlinear dynamical systems . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results from our proposed method , are in unison with monte carlo simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> probabilistic robustness , uncertainty propagation , transfer operator , optimal transport . </S>"
