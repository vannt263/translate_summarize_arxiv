    "one of the characteristic features of the fundamental group of a closed @xmath11-manifold is that its representation variety in a compact lie group tends to be finite , in a properly understood sense .",
    "this has been a guiding principle for defining invariants of @xmath11-manifolds ever since casson defined his @xmath12-invariant for integral homology @xmath11-spheres via a signed count of the @xmath2 representations of the fundamental group , where signs were determined using heegaard splittings .    among numerous generalizations of casson s",
    "construction , we will single out the invariant of knots in @xmath13 defined by xiao - song lin @xcite via a signed count of @xmath2 representations of the fundamental group of the knot exterior .",
    "the latter is a @xmath11-manifold with non - empty boundary so the above finiteness principle only applies after one imposes a proper boundary condition .",
    "lin s choice of the boundary condition , namely , that all of the knot meridians are represented by trace - free @xmath2 matrices , resulted in an invariant @xmath0 of knots @xmath14 .",
    "lin further showed that @xmath0 equals half the knot signature of @xmath4 .",
    "the signs in lin s construction were determined using braid representations for knots .",
    "austin ( unpublished ) and heusener and kroll @xcite extended this construction by letting the meridians of the knot be represented by @xmath2 matrices with a fixed trace which need not be zero .",
    "their construction gives , for each choice of the trace , a knot invariant which equals one half times the equivariant knot signature .    in this paper",
    ", we extend lin s construction to two - component links @xmath10 in @xmath13 .",
    "in essence , we replace the count of @xmath2 representations with a count of _ projective _",
    "@xmath2 representations of @xmath15 , in the sense of @xcite , with a fixed 2-cocycle representing a non - trivial element in the second group cohomology of @xmath7 .",
    "the resulting signed count is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "the two main results of this paper are then as follows .",
    "for any two - component link @xmath6 , the integer @xmath5 is a well defined invariant of @xmath10 .",
    "for any two - component link @xmath16 in @xmath13 , one has @xmath17    it is worth mentioning that our choice of the 2-cocycle imposes lin s trace - free condition on us .",
    "this is in contrast to lin s construction , where the choice of boundary condition seemed somewhat arbitrary .",
    "this also means one should not expect to extend our construction to @xmath2 representations with non - zero trace boundary condition .",
    "shortly after casson introduced his invariant for homology @xmath11-spheres , taubes @xcite gave a gauge theoretic description of it in terms of a signed count of flat @xmath2 connections .",
    "after lin s work , but before heusener and kroll , a gauge theoretic interpretation of the lin invariant was given by herald @xcite .",
    "he used this interpretation to define an extension of the lin invariant , now known as the herald ",
    "lin invariant , to knots in arbitrary homology spheres , with arbitrary fixed - trace ( possibly non - zero ) boundary condition .    another attractive feature of the gauge theoretic approach is that it can be used to produce ramified versions of the above invariants .",
    "floer @xcite introduced the instanton homology theory whose euler characteristic is twice the casson invariant .",
    "we expect that our invariant will have a similar interpretation , perhaps along the lines of the knot instanton homology theory of kronheimer and mrowka @xcite , which in turn is a variant of the orbifold floer homology of collin and steer @xcite .",
    "we hope to discuss this elsewhere , together with possible extensions to links in homology spheres and to links of more than two components .",
