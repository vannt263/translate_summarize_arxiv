    "in this paper , we consider a family of exact solutions of the kp equation , @xmath9 the solution @xmath2 is obtained from the @xmath10-function @xmath11 as @xmath12 it is well known that some solutions can be obtained by the wronskian form ( for example see @xcite ) , @xmath13 where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is a linearly independent set of @xmath0 solutions of the equations , @xmath16 throughout this paper , we assume @xmath17 to have the form , @xmath18 with some constants @xmath19 which define the @xmath20 matrix @xmath21 , and the phase functions @xmath22 are given by @xmath23 here @xmath24 and @xmath25 are arbitrary constants , and throughout this paper we assume @xmath24 being ordered as @xmath26 then choosing particular forms for the matrix @xmath27 , one can obtain several exact solutions of the kp equation . as the simplest case with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath30 with @xmath31 , we have 1-soliton solution , @xmath32 here we assumed @xmath33 and absorbed them to the constants @xmath25 , so that we have @xmath34 . note here that if @xmath35 , then the @xmath10-function has zeros and the solution blows up at some points in the @xmath36-@xmath37 plane . in the @xmath36-@xmath37 plane",
    ", 1-soliton solution describes a plane wave @xmath38 having the wavenumber vector @xmath39 and the frequency @xmath40 , @xmath41 here @xmath42 satisfies the dispersion relation , @xmath43 .",
    "we refer to the 1-soliton solution as a line soliton , which is expressed by a line @xmath44 in the @xmath36-@xmath37 plane for a fixed @xmath45",
    ". then the slope of the line @xmath46 represnts the velocity of the line soliton in the @xmath36-direction with respect to @xmath37 ; that is , @xmath47 indicates the direction of the positive @xmath37-axis . as in the paper @xcite",
    ", we also call a line soliton as @xmath48$]-soliton , if the soliton is parametrized by the pair @xmath49 . in the case of ( [ 1soliton ] ) ,",
    "the soliton is @xmath50$]-soliton with the velocity @xmath51 .",
    "then the ordinary @xmath0-soliton solution consisting of @xmath0 line solitons , @xmath52$]-soliton with @xmath53 , is obtained from the following matrix @xmath27 with @xmath54 @xcite , @xmath55 note here that all nonzero entries are normalized to be one by choosing appropriate constants @xmath25 , and any @xmath56 minor of the matrix @xmath57 is non - negative .",
    "the fact that all @xmath56 minors are non - negative ( or non - positive ) is sufficient for the solution to be non singular ( see below ) .    also in the paper @xcite , we found that if all the minors are nonzero and have the same sign , the solution @xmath58 gives an @xmath59-soliton solution consisting of @xmath60 incoming line solitons as @xmath4 and @xmath0 outgoing line solitons as @xmath61 .",
    "the set of the @xmath10-functions with different size @xmath0 then provide the solution of the toda lattice .",
    "in particular , if @xmath54 , we have @xmath0-soliton solution in the sence that the solution has the same set of @xmath0 line solitons in both asymptotics for @xmath62 ( i.e. the sets of incoming and outgoing solitons are the same ) .",
    "however as mentioned in @xcite , this @xmath0-soliton solution is different from the ordinary @xmath0-soliton solution , and the interaction of any pair of line solitons is in resonance . in this case",
    ", the matrix @xmath57 can be written in the following row reduced echelon form ( rref ) , @xmath63 where the entries marked by `` @xmath64 '' are chosen so that all the @xmath56 minors are nonzero and positive ( i.e. all the @xmath64 s of the last row should be all positive , and those in the second row from the bottom are negative and so on ) .",
    "note here that those @xmath64 s are all nonzero .",
    "then the line solitons in @xmath0-soliton solution of the toda lattice hierarchy are given by @xmath65$]-soliton for @xmath53 .",
    "we then expect that the general case of @xmath0-soliton solutions has a mixed pattern consisting of resonant and non - resonant interactions among those line solitons . in this paper , we classfy all the possible @xmath0-soliton solutions obtaind by the @xmath10-function ( [ tau ] ) with @xmath66 s in ( [ f - function ] ) and @xmath54 . the classification is to determine all possible patterns of interactions , and it is done by constructing a specific form of the coefficient matrix @xmath67 in ( [ f - function ] ) for each class of @xmath0-soliton solutions .",
    "it turns out that a complete classification of @xmath0-soliton solutions can be obtained by the complementary pair of ordered sets of @xmath0-numbers , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which are related to the dominant exponentials in the @xmath10-function for @xmath70 and each soliton is given by @xmath71$]-soliton .",
    "notice that with the set @xmath72 , there are @xmath73 number of different sets of @xmath0 pairs .",
    "we then claim that each set of @xmath0 pairs corresponds to an @xmath0-soliton solution , and provide an explicit way to construct all those @xmath0-soliton solutions .",
    "it is also well - known that a solution of the kp hierarchy is a gl@xmath74-orbit on infinite dimensional grassmannian ( sato grassmannian ) @xcite .",
    "then the @xmath0-soliton solution can be identified as the @xmath75-dimensional torus orbit on the grassmannian gr@xmath7 , and the coefficient matrix @xmath76 represnts a point on gr@xmath7 .",
    "since the grassmannian has the schubert cell decomposition , one can first classify the matrix @xmath76 using the decomposition , i.e. identify the cell @xmath76 belongs to .",
    "this classification corresponds to the set @xmath77 , and the @xmath78 gives a further decomposition of the cells to classify the interaction patterns of @xmath0-soliton solutions .",

    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we give a general basic structure of the @xmath10-function , and present all types of @xmath83-soliton solutions , which provide the building blocks for the general case of @xmath0-soliton solutions . here",

    "we briefly introduce the grassmannian gr@xmath85 and the schubert decomposition of gr@xmath85 .",
    "we also identify @xmath0-soliton solution as an 2@xmath0-dimensional torus orbit on gr@xmath7 , and briefly mention that gr@xmath7 contains all possible @xmath86-soliton solutions for @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which are distinguished by the schubert decomposition . here",
    "@xmath86-soliton is the solution consisting of @xmath89 incoming solitons for @xmath4 and @xmath90 outgoing solitons for @xmath3 ( see @xcite ) . in section 4",
    ", we describe the structure of the coefficient matrix @xmath76 for each @xmath0-soliton solution by prescribing an explicit construction of the matrix @xmath76 .",
    "we here define _ @xmath0-soliton condition _ on the matrix @xmath76 which determines local structures based on the types of 2-soliton interactions in the @xmath0-soliton solution .",
    "finally , in section [ kdv ] , we discuss @xmath0-soliton solutions of the kdv equation , and show that the kdv @xmath0-soliton solution can not have resonant interactions .",
    "let us start with the follwoing lemma which shows the basic structure of the @xmath10-function :    [ binet ] the @xmath10-function ( [ tau ] ) with @xmath66 s given in ( [ f - function ] ) can be expanded as a sum of exponential functions , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the @xmath56 minor given by the @xmath93-th columns with @xmath53 in the matrix @xmath94 of ( [ f - function ] ) , @xmath95    apply the binet - cauchy theorem for the expression ( see for example @xcite ) , @xmath96 where @xmath97 with @xmath98 .    from this lemma , it is clear that if all the minors @xmath92 are non - negative ( or non - positive ) , then the @xmath10-function is sign definite and the corresponding solution @xmath58 is nonsingular ( recall also the order @xmath99 ) .",
    "this is the first restriction on the matrix @xmath27 for @xmath0-soliton solution , and we later impose that all the @xmath56 minors are non - negative after making @xmath27 to be in the row reduced echelon form .",

    "i.e. @xmath100 , one can find the asymptotic behavious of the @xmath10-function for @xmath101 : for this purpose , we first define the function @xmath102 given by @xmath103 suppose that @xmath102 has the asymptotic form with some numbers @xmath104 , @xmath105 it is clear that @xmath106 and @xmath107 if @xmath108 . then with the sets of @xmath0 numbers @xmath109 s in the asymptotics ( [ asymptotics ] ) ,",
    "we define the following two @xmath0-vectors with the entries from the set @xmath110 :    a pair @xmath5 of @xmath0-vectors are defined by @xmath111 the ordering in the set @xmath77 is just a convenience , and once we made the ordering in @xmath77 , we do not assume a further ordering for other set @xmath78 .",
    "we assume that those sets are complementary in the set @xmath110 .",
    "as will be explained below , this assumption is necessary to have an @xmath0-soliton solution , that is , the solution has the same sets of @xmath0 line solitons for both asymptotics @xmath62 .    with those number sets @xmath77 and @xmath78 , one can define the pair of young diagrams @xmath84 :    [ young ] we define a pair @xmath84 associated to the pair @xmath5 :    * the @xmath112 is a young diagram represented by @xmath113 with @xmath114 where each @xmath115 represents the number of boxes in a row counting from the bottom ( note @xmath116 ) . *",

    "however the number of boxes in @xmath117 gives the number of intersection vertices of @xmath0-soliton solution having a particular type of interaction ( theorem [ num - res ] ) .    as a main goal of this paper",
    ", we will show in section [ amatrix ] that for each pair @xmath5 one can construct an @xmath0-soliton solution consisting of @xmath0 line solitons , each of which is given by @xmath71$]-soliton for @xmath53 .",

    "the item 3 ) will be given in section [ amatrix ] .    in order to classify those @xmath0-soliton solutions , we first note :    [ numbernminus ] for each given ordered set @xmath77 , the number of choices of @xmath78 is given by @xmath128    since @xmath129 , there are @xmath130 numbers of possible choices of @xmath131 . having made a choice of @xmath131 , one has @xmath132 many choices for @xmath133 . now repeating this ,",
    "the result is obvious .",

    "then the young diagrams @xmath147 associated to @xmath0-soliton solutions are given by a subdiagram of @xmath143 .",
    "note that @xmath148 is also the number of intersection vertices of @xmath0 lines in a plane in the general position .",
    "we will then determine whether each point is of resonant or non - resonant .    in figure",

    "this implies that if @xmath153 then @xmath154 . the duality can be considered as a symmetry of the kp equation : in particular , if @xmath155 for all @xmath156 , then @xmath0-soliton solution has the symmetry @xmath157 . in this case , at @xmath158 all the solitons intersect at the origin in the @xmath36-@xmath37 plane ( see figure [ 4sol : fig ] ) .",

    "let us now construct the matrix @xmath76 : the construction has several steps , and it might be better to explain the steps using an explict example .",
