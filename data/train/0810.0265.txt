    "qcd cosmology is important as the universe exits the radiation dominated era and enters the matter dominated era , eventually evolving into the dark energy dominated era @xcite .",
    "the effect of the strong interactions on cosmology was considered early on @xcite but the nonperturbative nature of the strong interactions at low energy limited the progress of the subject . today with nonperturbative approaches like",
    "lattice qcd @xcite and ads / qcd @xcite it is important to revisit the subject to see what can be said quantitatively about qcd cosmology . also besides the time dependence of the scale factor in qcd cosmology , one can also look at the effect of recent advances on the qcd equation of state for exotic astrophysical objects like quark or strange stars @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker universe where the radius of the universe @xmath0 , energy density @xmath1 , and pressure @xmath2 all depend on time .",
    "conservation of the local energy - momentum tensor leads to : @xmath3 the friedmann equation relates the time evolution of the universe to energy density and is is given by : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "the equation of state refers to the dependence of energy density and pressure on temperature @xmath6 . for a given equation of state one can rewrite the above two equations in a form which determines the expansion factor @xmath0 .",
    "first we can determine the time dependence of the temperature from : @xmath7 this can be integrated to give : @xmath8 then one can invert the function @xmath9 to yield @xmath10 .",
    "next one can determine the radius @xmath0 time dependence from equation  ( [ eq : emtensor ] ) which is integrated to yield : @xmath11    for a simple example consider a radiation dominated universe with equation of state : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a constant .",
    "solving equation  ( [ eq : dtdt ] ) we find @xmath14 and @xmath15 . performing the integration ( [ eq : at ] )",
    "we obtain : @xmath16 this @xmath17 time dependence also gives the very high temperature and early time behavior of qcd cosmology .    for nonzero cosmological constant @xmath18 the friedmann equation",
    "is modified to : @xmath19 for all the models of low energy qcd that we use in this paper the cosmological constant provides only a small modification .",
    "this is because the energy density scale of low energy qcd is typically @xmath20 whereas the cosmological constant is @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "modifications are expected by the cosmological constant as can been seen , e.g. , by the scale factor for matter domination @xmath22 which reduces to @xmath23 at small times and @xmath24 at large times .",
    "we will not investigate corrections with respect to the cosmological constant in this paper and leave this for further study at a later stage .",
    "another possible modification to the cosmological equations for @xmath0 involves the bulk viscosity .",
    "the inclusion of bulk viscosity modifies the conservation equation by : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the bulk viscosity .",
    "qcd bulk viscosity is currently being studied in heavy ion collisions and qcd , see e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively , thus it is of interest to see what cosmological effect the bulk viscosity may have .",
    "we leave the study of the cosmological effects of the bulk viscosity for future work .    for any realistic equation of state related to qcd",
    "the above steps which determine @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath27 and @xmath0 all have to be done numerically .",
    "we shall find a simple radiation dominated picture for the scale factor @xmath0 at early times corresponding to deconfinement . at late times",
    "the time dependence of the scale factor is quite complex .",
    "one can use an effective description using masses of various resonances form the particle data table as in the hadronic resonance gas model ( hrg)@xcite , one can use an effective hagedorn string picture @xcite as weinberg and huang did in @xcite , one can use a ads / cft approach to the equation of state @xcite , a symmetry which relates small radius to large radius qcd - like theories if one thinks of the time direction as compactified as in an imaginary time formalism @xcite , or one can use lattice simulations to determine the equation of state @xcite . in this paper",
    "we compare the results of some of these approaches applied to the calculation of the scale factor @xmath0 .    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the numerical determination of the scale factor of the universe as a function of time , @xmath0 , from the lattice qcd equation of state .",
    "we work with zero chemical potential and bulk viscosity .",
    "we plan to include these in future work . in section 3",
    "we determine the scale factor from the hadronic resonance gas model model . in section 4",
    "we discuss the scale factor time dependence for an early universe model which has a hagedorn ultimate temperature . in section 5",
    "we discuss the scale factor determined from the ads / cft approach to the equation of state following a similar approach to gubser and nellore @xcite . in section 6 we state the main conclusions of the paper .",
    "lattice qcd is a modern tool which allows one to systematically study the non - perturbative regime of the qcd equation of state . utilizing supercomputers the qcd equation of state",
    "was calculated on the lattice in  @xcite with two light quarks and a heavier strange quark on a @xmath28 size lattice .",
    "the quark masses have been chosen to be close to their physical value , i.e. the pion mass is about @xmath29 . for further details",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite , however , we like to remark that the equation of state was calculated at a temporal extent of the lattice @xmath30 and for @xmath30 sizable lattice cut - off effects are still present  @xcite .    the data for energy density @xmath31 , pressure @xmath32 and trace anomaly @xmath33 and entropy @xmath34 of ref .",
    "@xcite are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "all the analysis in this section is derived from this data . besides the strange quark",
    "one can also include the effect of the charm quark as well as photons and leptons on the equation of state .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     rewriting the equation  ( [ eq : dtdt ] ) that determines the time dependence of the temperature in terms of entropy and energy density we have : @xmath39 then using the correspondence from table  [ tab2 ] one can determine the radius of the 4d universe @xmath0 from  ( [ eq : dtdts ] ) .",
    "this is plotted in figure  [ fig10 ] .",
    "one can see from the plot on right hand side of figure  [ fig10 ] that over the temperature range covered by the lattice qcd data one never leaves the radiation regime and the scale factor is well approximated by @xmath40",
    ".    in this ads approach it is is important not to confuse the scale factor @xmath0 with the dual radius @xmath41 .",
    "one uses the black hole solution including @xmath41 to determine the entropy , temperature and energy density and then uses  ( [ eq : dtdts ] ) to determine the scale factor @xmath0 through the correspondence in table  [ tab2 ] .      because the vacuum solution to @xmath42 gravity does not match with the lattice qcd data at low temperature and stays in the radiation regime over the temperature range of lattice qcd , one looks for non vacuum solutions that can mimic the lattice qcd equation of state . in @xcite",
    "the potential @xmath43 was used to describe a @xmath42 black hole with nonzero dilaton field . for nonzero @xmath44 and @xmath45",
    "one can solve the equations of motion numerically .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that the speed of sound associated with the potential ( 5.2 ) closely approximates the speed of sound from lattice qcd .    for nonzero dilaton",
    "it is convenient to replace the coordinate @xmath46 by @xmath47 .",
    "then the asymptotic region @xmath48 corresponds to @xmath49 . in the coordinate @xmath50 , the five dimensional metric ansatz is taken to be : @xmath51 it is convenient to choose the gauge : @xmath52 in this gauge the equations of motion become : @xmath53 where the prime refers to the derivative with respect to @xmath50 and as before where we have defined @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we found that the asymptotic form of the dilaton at small @xmath50 had an important effect on the values of the entropy and mass of the black hole thus one needs to carefully study the effects of various dilaton boundary conditions to mimic the lattice qcd equation of state . in the asymptotic regime near for small @xmath50",
    "we seek a black hole solution to to the equations of motion with a small asymptotic value for the dilaton field @xmath56 .    for small @xmath50",
    "we set : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a deformation parameter . in terms of @xmath59 and @xmath60",
    "this becomes : @xmath61 one can then use the second equation in ( 5.3 ) to solve for the asymptotic form of the dilaton by integrating : @xmath62 as in @xcite .",
    "this leads to the asymptotic form of the dilaton : @xmath63 expanding this expression for small @xmath50 we find : @xmath64 one can use this expression to define a boundary condition on the dilaton field for small @xmath50",
    ". then one can numerically solve for the black hole solution with potential ( 5.2 ) and a given deformation parameter @xmath58 .",
    "as @xmath58 goes to zero one has the vacuum black hole solution discussed in the previous subsection .    for @xmath65 the entropy , mass ( energy density ) , and temperature",
    "are all modified by the dilaton . in figure  [ fig11 ]",
    "we plot the entropy and mass as a function of temperature for @xmath65 .",
    "one can then use equation  ( [ eq : dtdts ] ) to calculate the time dependence of the physical radius @xmath0 .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig12 ] .",
    "the inclusion of the dilaton creates nontrivial deviation from the radiation type expansion at late times and low temperatures .",
    "in particular , we observe in figure  [ fig12 ] the upward bending hockey stick behavior that is qualitatively similar to that of lattice qcd .    without the dilaton",
    "the scale factor @xmath0 can be described by the radiation expression @xmath17 over the temperature range covered by the lattice qcd calculation . with the dilaton it is possible to describe a late time behavior similar to lattice qcd .",
    "we have computed the time dependence of the scale factor from the lattice qcd equation of state with @xmath30 .",
    "we find that the scale factor is described by a radiation dominated universe @xmath17 at early times with a complicated time dependence at late times which seems to be closer to a matter dominated universe .",
    "we compared our results from lattice qcd with other approaches to the low temperature equation of state including the hadronic resonance gas model , the hagedorn model and the ads / cft equation of state .",
    "we found that on a log log plot the scale factor displayed an upward pointing hockey stick behavior for the lattice qcd data .",
    "for the hadronic resonance gas model over the temperature range of lattice qcd data , the hrg model lies above the lattice qcd data  @xcite .",
    "the slope of the log log plot for the scale factor is between the radiation value .5 and the matter dominated value .666 for the hrg model in this regime .",
    "the hagedorn model leads to a limiting temperature as a function of time and works better a low temperature and late times .",
    "the equations are simpler than the hrg model because less experimental input is required but lead to a diverging energy density at the hagedorn temperature unlike the lattice qcd data .",
    "the hagedorn cosmological model is still of interest for theories where the limiting temperature is at the tev scale or the planck scale . for the ads",
    "/ qcd model we found that without the dilaton the entropy and energy density led to a @xmath17 expansion over the temperature range of lattice qcd .",
    "we introduced a parameter @xmath58 that determined the boundary condition at infinity for the dilaton . turning the dilaton on and",
    "tuning the parameter @xmath58 allowed us to derive a time dependence for the scale factor that was qualitatively similar to that of lattice qcd through the ads / qcd correspondence .    with future improvements in lattice qcd calculations and deeper understanding of the role of ads",
    "/ qcd it will be interesting to revisit the subject of qcd cosmology by adding the effects of bulk viscosity , chemical potentials and interaction with leptons . eventually one would like to make contact with astrophysical measurements of the early universe as envisioned in early references such as @xcite .",
