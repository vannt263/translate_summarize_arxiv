    "<S> every isometry of a finite dimensional euclidean space is a product of reflections and the minimum length of a reflection factorization defines a metric on its full isometry group . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we identify the structure of intervals in this metric space by constructing , for each isometry , an explicit combinatorial model encoding all of its minimal length reflection factorizations . </S>",
    "<S> the model is largely independent of the isometry chosen in that it only depends on whether or not some point is fixed and the dimension of the space of directions that points are moved .    </S>",
    "<S> every good geometry book proves that each isometry of euclidean @xmath0-space is a product of at most @xmath1 reflections and several more - advanced sources include scherk s theorem which identifies the minimal length of such a reflection factorization from the basic geometric attributes of the isometry under consideration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the full set of minimal length reflection factorizations , on the other hand , does not appear to have been given an elementary treatment in the literature even though the proof only requires basic geometric tools . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we construct , for each isometry , an explicit combinatorial model encoding all of its minimal length reflection factorizations . </S>",
    "<S> the model is largely independent of the isometry chosen in that it only depends on whether or not some point is fixed and the dimension of the space of directions that points are moved .    </S>",
    "<S> analogous results for spherical isometries already exist and are easy to state : when @xmath2 is an orthogonal linear transformation of @xmath3 only fixing the origin , for example , there is a natural bijection between minimal length factorizations of @xmath2 into reflections fixing the origin and complete flags of linear subspaces in @xmath3 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the structure of all such factorizations is encoded in the lattice of linear subspaces of @xmath3 with one factorization for each maximal chain . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a similar poset for euclidean isometries but its structure is more complicated . </S>",
    "<S> the motivation for constructing these combinatorial models is to use them to analyze the structure of euclidean artin groups . </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite and @xcite for details . </S>",
    "<S> it is with this application in mind that we include an examination of the extent to which these posets are lattices .    </S>",
    "<S> the article is structured as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the first four sections establish basic definitions , the middle sections define the combinatorial models and establish our main result , and the final sections explore the extent to which the constructed posets fail to be complete lattices . </S>"
