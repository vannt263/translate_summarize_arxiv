    "wind3d is a new radiation transport code that computes detailed spectral line profiles formed in the scattering winds of massive stars .",
    "the time - independent transfer equation is solved following the numerical scheme proposed by adam ( 1990 ) for three - dimensional cartesian grids .",
    "the fortran code is being developed for high performance computers with parallel processing .",
    "it currently runs on the 64-bit 56 cpu compute server of the royal observatory of belgium .",
    "figures 1 to 3 discuss the results of calculations with wind3d performed with @xmath0 gridpoints on an equidistant mesh .",
    "the code lambda iterates the 3d source function to accuracies better than 1% .",
    "the local mean intensity integral currently sums @xmath1 spatial angles for 100 wavelength points of the line profile .",
    "the non - lte 3d transfer equation for the 2-level atom is solved for @xmath2 interpolated gridpoints using a gaussian profile function .",
    "wind3d has carefully been load balanced for parallel processing and shows excellent scaling properties .",
    "we test wind3d with parameterized input models of the wind velocity and wind opacity in the supersonically accelerating winds of ob stars .",
    "the line source function of the unperturbed wind is computed in the sobolev approximation . for strong resonance lines formed in the winds of massive hot stars we currently neglect the thermal contribution to the line source function .",
    "we consider a beta law for an isothermal wind with @xmath3=1 and @xmath4=35 @xmath5 .",
    "the _ smooth _ wind assumes a terminal velocity of @xmath6=1600 @xmath7 within the simulation box of 12 @xmath4 .",
    "the thermal line broadening is set to a small value of 8 @xmath7 .",
    "the smooth wind is perturbed with parameterized spiraling structures that are wound around the star ( _ figs . 1 - 2 _ ) .",
    "next the source function in these regions of larger gas density is 3d lambda iterated to equilibrium with the radiation field of the ambient wind .",
    "the convergence can be accelerated but our tests show that it is already fast and occurs within 5 to 8 iterations when the azimuthal extension of the cirs is limited to one @xmath4 at the outer edge . the converged 3d source function is then utilized to solve the transfer problem for equidistant lines of sight in the plane of the equator around the star .",
    "important free parameters for the detailed line profile modeling therefore involve the 3d properties of the spiraling wind structures ( the number of arms , curvature , width , height , and density contrast ) , and the inclination of the observer lines of sight in or above the plane of the equator .",
    "these simplified 3d cir models already provide good comparisons with the observed evolution of dacs in uv spectra of hot stars ( e.g. see fig . 1 of fullerton et al .",
    "further tests with dense spherical perturbations of the wind ( i.e. a clump in fig .",
    "3 ) reveal that a shadow behind the clump can be computed with wind3d , which also appears in the theoretical line profiles ( _ left panel of fig . 3 _ ) .             with the hot star at box center",
    "the smooth stellar wind is radially symmetric with a beta - power velocity law ( _ outer blue arrows _ ) .",
    "the local velocities inside the cirs also assume the beta law of the ambient wind , but the velocity vectors are drawn with larger density ( _ inner green to red arrows _ ) .",
    "the widths of the cirs increase outwards with an exponential curvature .",
    "the outer edges are truncated at a maximum radius of 9 @xmath4 .",
    "the thickness of the cirs in the equator plane increases outwards to a maximum of one @xmath4 .",
    "the flux contrast of the dacs with respect to scattering wind absorption increases and decreases while shifting bluewards ( _ upwards in fig . 1 _ ) because the dacs narrow ( due to the decrease of local wind velocity dispersion ) and the line opacity ( i.e. local gas density ) inside the cirs decreases radially .",

    "dacs in their figure 1 are recognized as rather narrow absorption features observed to appear around @xmath91 d and @xmath911 d , drifting towards shorter wavelengths .",
    "the broader and nearly horizontal absorption features with @xmath91.2 d periodicity are called _ modulations _ and are not considered in our 3d models . the observed time evolution of the dacs is well reproduced with the model in fig .",
    "2 . the dacs drift toward larger velocities because the observer probes regions of enhanced wind absorption inside one spiral arm at increasing distances from the stellar surface while the entire structure rotates through his line of sight . the other ( anti - symmetric ) spiral arm produces the trailing dac that drifts almost parallel to the former until it also reaches the terminal wind velocity in fig .",
    "1 . the number of spiral arms crossing the line of sight determines the number of dacs in a line profile .",
    "the rotation period of hd  64760 is 4.8 d , which indicates that the spiral arms producing the dacs are wound at least twice around the central star .",
    "other 3d models with thicker spiraling density structures extending azimuthally ( with much larger opening angles ) also produce dacs for lines of sight above the equator plane . in the latter case",
