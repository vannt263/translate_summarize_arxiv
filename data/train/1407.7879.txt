    "one is based on the dispersal timescale of protoplanetary disks , and is directly related to the stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the other relies on tidal interaction and orbital decay ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the former mechanism requires the masses of the evolved stars to be higher than those of the main sequence hosts .",
    "whether or not this condition is consistent with observations has recently been the topic of some debate @xcite .",
    "the fact remains , however , that both stellar evolution and tidal interaction still involve considerable uncertainties .",
    "for instance , the prescription used for mass loss affects the orbital evolution both directly as winds carry away angular momentum , and through its effects on the stellar radius ( and thereby on tidal interaction ) .",
    "the ratio of planet mass to stellar mass also strongly affects tides .",
    "previous studies of the orbital evolution of planetary systems around rgb stars did not investigate either the effects of the adopted mass - loss prescription or the planet s eccentricity evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) ; focused on large orbital distances @xcite ; or on the outcome of the orbital evolution in a later stage , the asymptotic giant branch phase and its relevance for the detection of systems during the white dwarf phase @xcite .",
    "although a range of stellar masses has been considered by @xcite their tidal evolution calculation was greatly simplified because of the unavailability of the the internal stellar structure needed for the calculation in their models .    in the present work , we present detailed , self consistent , stellar models coupled with orbital evolution .",
    "our computational grid encompasses the evolution from the main sequence , and up to the onset of helium burning in the stellar core .",
    "we have selected a range of stellar masses from 1.5 to 2 , in steps of 0.1 , and for each stellar mass we have computed the evolution of the star with 3 different prescriptions for the mass - loss . for each star",
    ", we have calculated the orbital evolution with planetary masses corresponding that of neptune , and to 1 , 2 , 5 , and 10 jupiter masses .",
    "we have also considered the planet s eccentricity evolution .",
    "our goal is to characterize and quantify the effects of mass - loss , stellar mass ( in an interesting range ) , planetary mass and eccentricity on planet survival along the red giant branch ( rgb ) phase .",
    "we follow the same procedure as in @xcite ( from now on vl09 ) and @xcite to determine the planet orbital and eccentricity evolution as the star evolves off the main sequence(ms ) and up the rgb .",
    "we take into account the changes in the mass of the star , the gravitational and frictional drag , and the tidal force .",
    "we have not evaluated in this paper either the accretion onto , or the ablation of matter from , the surface of the planet . based on the estimates provided by the prescription given in vl09 we find that the effect of mass - loss from the star dominates over those processes , even when small rgb mass - loss rates are considered .",
    "we use three different prescriptions for the mass - loss in this paper ; two that follow a reimers law valid for red giants @xcite and use values of @xmath0 ( the reimers parameter ) of 0.2 and 0.5 in the formula , @xmath1~~ , \\label{rei}\\ ] ] and a third one based on the new semiempirical relation provided by @xcite @xmath2~~ , \\label{sch}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the stellar luminosity , radius , surface gravity , and mass respectively ( in solar units ) and the factor @xmath7 has been obtained by fitting the theoretical relation to observations of globular clusters with different metallicities ; @xmath8 is the sun s surface gravity .",

    "that since giant stars have deep convective zones the most appropiate mechanism to describe the equilibrium tide is the one adopted here ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus it is inappropriate to apply the @xmath38 formalism using the ms calibration for our stars and will anyhow result on much weaker tides than assumed .",
    "we have neglected other tidal mechanisms such as dynamical tides ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which although may be important for massive stars during the ms they are mostly irrelevant for the computations for convective stars presented here .    only during the ms phase we might have a non - convective star . thus for stars without a convection zone and just in order to avoid numerical round - off errors we set the convective time - scale to an arbitrarily large value ( @xmath42years ) . note that during the ms we are only studying the eccentricity evolution for which only the planetary tides are important .    for eccentric orbits we have also implemented a planetary tide using the standard @xmath38 model ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "the reason for this lies in the stellar tidal model ; the different fourier components have different frequency dependencies , and as the eccentricity rises , higher - frequency fourier components come into play .",
    "nevertheless , for this exploratory study , we used the truncated equations even for highly eccentric planets , deferring a full expansion of the tidal forces to future work .",
    "it is important to keep in mind as well that , as discussed in @xcite , the parameters in the tidal equations are poorly known , and consequently the tidal forces may be stronger or weaker than assumed here .",
    "the main uncertainty in the tidal model used comes from the need to reduce the effective viscosity when the tidal period is short compared to the typical convective timescale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is taken into account by variations in the power index @xmath48 in eq .",
    "[ gamaa ] .",

    "the tidal model is only sensitive to the assumed value of @xmath48 for small orbital distances when the stellar radius is small ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus variations in the power index will not lead to any significant changes in the final outcome of our planets since we are dealing with stars that reach a large radius at the tip of the rgb .",
    "if the planet has such a short orbital period to be sensitive to the adopted @xmath48 then it would be engulfed very early by the expansion of the star .",
    "measurements of the spin rates of giants provide average values of @xmath50(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with rapid rotators found only in a few percent ( 1 - 2 % ) of giant stars @xcite .",
    "these observations justify our assumption of using non - rotating stars for the calculation of the tidal forces .",
    "planet spin rates were allowed with values between 10 and 1000 radians per year .",
    "a proper calculation of the stellar tides requires knowledge of the stellar structure ( i.e. @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "note that some calculations in the literature , do not have this information and as result they rely on simplifications such as the assumption that @xmath26 = @xmath6 and @xmath27 = @xmath51 for the evaluation of the effects of tidal dissipation on the planet s orbital evolution .",
    "the stellar evolution models were calculated with the starevol code @xcite .",
    "we have computed a small grid of non - rotating models with initial masses in the range 1.5 and 2 in mass steps of 0.1 . based on the observations by @xcite",
    "we have chosen a stellar metallicity that fullfils two requirements : i ) it is consistent with the observed metallicity of planet - hosting giant stars with stellar masses m@xmath52 1.5 ; and ii ) it agrees with the observed metallicities of subgiant stars with planets detected .",
    "the initial metallicity is thus set to [ fe / h]=0.19 with a composition scaled solar according to @xcite .",
    "we do not consider any `` extra - mixing processes '' such as overshooting or thermohaline mixing and use the schwarzschild criterion to define the convective boundaries .",
    "we adopt @xmath53 for the mixing length parameter which value was determined from solar fitting models . as described above , we considered three representative mass - loss rate prescriptions ( see eqs .",
    "[ rei ] and [ sch ] ) .",
    "the extent of the rgb on the hr diagram is very sensitive to the stellar mass for values around the transition mass that marks the border between degenerate and non - degenerate cores .",
    "we use here rgb models with masses lower than 2.0 because they develop electron degenerate he cores after the end of central h - burning for solar metallicity .",
    "these stars have an extended and luminous rgb phase prior to helium ignition and therefore represent the most interesting arena for the problem analyzed in this paper .",
    "the maximum stellar luminosity at the tip of the rgb is reached for stars with degenerate cores and it translates into a maximum stellar radius reached during the rgb .",
    "higher mass stars can ignite helium quietly , terminating the ascent up the rgb before electron degeneracy becomes appreciable in the core , and they reach smaller radii than stars with degenerate cores .",
    "note , however , that the precise value of the transition mass between low and intermediate mass stars depends on the initial chemical composition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "decreasing the initial helium abundance or increasing the heavy element abundances leads to higher transition stellar masses .",
    "thus for stars born in higher metallicity environments , we have larger initial masses marking the transition between degenerate and non - degenerate he cores .",
    "we summarize in table  1 some of the properties of our stellar models .",
    "column ( 1 ) gives the initial mass ; column ( 2 ) the mass - loss prescription used where sc refers to the @xcite model and @xmath54 is a model with overshooting ; column ( 3 ) gives the stellar mass at the time of the deepest extent of the convective envelope during the first dredge - up ( 1dup ) ; columns ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) , and ( 6 ) give the stellar mass , radius and luminosity at the tip of the rgb respectively ; column ( 7 ) provides the mass of the hydrogen depleted core ; column ( 8) the mass - loss rate at the tip of the rgb , and column ( 9 ) gives the duration of the rgb phase between the time of the 1dup and the rgb tip . finally column ( 10 )",
    "gives the minimum initial orbital distance to avoid engulfment at the tip of the rgb calculated for a planet with the mass of jupiter .",
    "as hydrogen becomes exhausted at the center of the star , core contraction accelerates and the star leaves the main sequence on the hr diagram . the major energy production source shifts to a thick shell outside the core where shell ignition drives envelope expansion and causes the stellar radius to increase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "shortly after the star reaches the base of the rgb , convection expands inward from the surface and the first dredge - up takes place .",
    "the planet s orbital evolution was computed by solving the system of eqs .",
    "[ todo ]  [ gs ] coupled with the stellar structure evolution .",
    "we did so for each of the six stellar masses and three mass - loss prescriptions considered ( a total of 18 stellar models ) and we used five planetary masses .",
    "for each one of these 90 models we then calculated the orbital evolution by varying the initial orbital separation between 0.1 and 3.5 @xmath55 using steps of 0.01 @xmath55 .",
    "every integration timestep included an update of the stellar structure ( fundamental for an accurate calculation of the stellar tide ) and of the variable mass - loss rates .",
    "we have introduced also a constraint in the orbital integration timestep so that it was never larger than the timestep at which a significant change in the stellar structure took place .",
    "we first consider circular orbits ( @xmath56 ) in eqs .",
    "[ eq : adotstar ] to [ gs ] to investigate the effects of changing the stellar models . for the systems considered in this paper , tidal dissipation in the star dominates ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and thus we justify circular orbits ( for now ) on the basis of the fact that both the eccentricity and the semi - major axis damp on similar time - scales @xcite .",
    "note as well that the initial value of the eccentricity has little effect on the orbital decay rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we first focus on estimating variations induced by varying parameters such as mass - loss , stellar mass or planet mass , and we defer the discussion of the eccentric orbits to  3.4 .    the combined effects of tidally induced orbital decay and mass - loss induced orbital expansion modifies the orbit of the planets in a simple way .",
    "if the initial planet separation is within a certain range of distances from the star , the planet will experience an orbital decay caused by the tidal interaction .",
    "this ends up with the planet plunging into the stellar envelope .",
    "if , on the other hand , the initial orbit is beyond a certain radius , the planet avoids engulfment .",
    "[ fig1_evo ] shows jupiter mass planet s orbits during @xmath57 0.06 gyr along the rgb phase for a range of initial orbital distances and a particular stellar model ( 1.5 with the @xcite mass - loss prescription ) .",
    "a few features in fig .  [ fig1_evo ] are worth noting .",
    "first , marked with a solid black line is the initial orbital distance beyond which the planet avoids falling into the stellar envelope during the rgb phase .",
    "every initial separation below the solid black line terminates with the planet being engulfed .",
    "what happens to those planets that enter the envelope largely depends on the ratio of the planet s mass to the envelope mass .",
    "many will end up merging with the stellar core , given the fast decay of the orbit induced by the strong drag forces @xcite .",
    "rough estimates of planet survival inside stellar envelopes provide minimum masses of the order of 10 - 15 jovian masses ( again , depending also on the envelope s mass ; @xcite ) .",
    "an analysis of the possible progenitors of the planets found orbiting the horizontal branch star kic 05807616 @xcite also concludes that the surviving planets likely had a mass of a few jupiter masses @xcite .",
    "note that for survival to occur , a planet must be able to supply enough of its orbital energy to the stellar envelope to unbind the latter before the planet spirals into the disruption region or the stellar core .",
    "unfortunately , the efficiency of the process of unbinding ( commonly parameterized with @xmath58 , e.g. @xcite ) is rather uncertain . given that the largest planet mass we are considering is 10 , our working hypothesis in this paper is that whenever the planet gets inside the stellar envelope it would be destroyed .",
    "we defer further discussion of planetary systems entering stellar envelopes for a forthcoming study .",
    "the second important feature of the planet s orbital evolution that is important to mention is the range of initial orbital distances that experience tidal decay but that still manage to avoid entering the surface of the star .",
    "this range of orbits lies in fig .",
    "[ fig1_evo ] close to the solid line .",
    "the dot - dashed black line shows a typical example of an orbit dominated by mass - loss",
    ". the orbital decay can be substantial for initial orbits close to the critical limit ( marked by the solid black line ) with the planet ending up in a significantly tighter orbit than the initial one .",
    "planets that start at orbital distances sligthly larger than marked by the solid line , still experience the consequences of tidal forces , but once helium burning is ignited in the core , the star contracts and the interaction stops . planets in this initial range do not reach the stellar envelope but end up at smaller separations .    beyond the dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig1_evo ] the orbits increase due to mass - loss from the system .",
    "[ todo ] clearly suggests that the critical orbital distance for engulfment , and the distance beyond which the separation is expected to increase are sensitively dependent on the mass - loss prescription adopted in the calculations ( for an analytical treatment of the problem see @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of our self - consistent calculation , with models under different mass - loss prescriptions , is to quantify the influence of this relatively poorly constrained parameter on planet survival during the rgb evolution .    along the rgb",
    "the models under different mass - loss prescriptions show significant differences associated entirely with the way these stars are losing mass ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the mass - loss rate during the rgb is relatively smooth ( see eqs [ rei ] and [ sch ] ) and never reaches high values ( see fig .",
    "[ massloss ] ) .",
    "the largest and smallest mass - loss rates are attained for the @xmath59 , and @xmath60 prescriptions respectively , with the @xcite model having mass - loss rates in between these two values . in fig .",
    "[ massloss ] we have plotted the evolution of the mass - loss under the 3 prescriptions used for the 1.5 model . in fig .",
    "[ mimf ] we show the stellar mass reached at the tip of the rgb versus the stellar ms mass .",
    "we tried to capture the main differences in the planet survival limit among the models in fig .",
    "[ fig_mases ] where we show for the 1.5 star the different evolution of the stellar radius for the three mass - loss prescriptions considered ( in red , blue and green for @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xcite respectively ) and how this leads to different orbital evolution for a jupiter mass planet .",
    "the evolution of the maximum initial orbit that enters the stellar envelope is shown for each the mass - loss prescriptions considered . for the @xcite model ( in green ) we have plotted as well as a set of initial orbits representative of the different possible outcomes .",
    "the evolutionary sequences are indistinguishable in terms of the stellar radius during the subgiant phase when mass - loss is negligible and the models do not show significant differences ( but not when the star starts the ascent onto the rgb ) .",
    "typical values of the radius at the rgb tip are given for the different stellar models in table  1 .",
    "mass - loss influences planet survival due to three combined effects : ( i ) it modifies the stellar radius , ( ii ) it changes the orbital angular momentum loss efficiency , and ( iii ) it changes the stellar mass and thus its evolutionary timescales . when comparing identical mass - loss prescriptions , if the mass - loss rate is higher ( the @xmath62 case ) , the pressure on the core is reduced and off - center helium ignition is delayed .",
    "the star reaches smaller radii and spends more time on the rgb .",
    "lower mass - loss rates under the same prescription for a given stellar and planet mass , lead to more distant planets plunging into the stellar surface due to the combined effects mentioned above .",
    "this is why using the lowest mass - loss rate simulation , the one using reimers with @xmath63 , we obtain the largest critical distance for engulfment ( see fig .  [ fig_mases ] ) .",
    "the impact of mass - loss on the stellar properties , however , is a highly non - linear process that depends on how fast the mass - loss accelerates along the rgb . note the longer resulting rgb evolutionary timescales obtained for the @xcite model .",
    "the minimum initial orbital distances that a jupiter mass planet has to have in order to avoid engulfment are given in the last column of table  1 , for the different stellar models used in the calculation .",
    "we obtain critical values for the engulfment radius that are always in the upper envelope of those plotted by @xcite in their figures ( for stars m@xmath64 1.82 ) but are consistent with those obtained for stars m@xmath65 [ 1.51.7 ] . given the simplification for the tidal forces these authors made in their paper we have tried to compute the @xmath66 obtained from their eq . 7 to see if this could be the cause of the difference .",
    "we obtain using this equation unrealistic critical distances using the numbers provided by our stellar models , the a@xmath67 we get under their prescription are very different from the values we obtain with our full calculation .",
    "generally , we find it hard to reproduce the numbers plotted in their graphs .",
    "in their computation for the critical distance @xcite argued that the differences between the critical distance for engulfment obtained by @xcite and their models was due to the inclusion of overshooting . in order to check this assertion",
    "we have computed 3 models ( for m@xmath68=1.5 , 1.7 and 1.9 ) using @xmath69 and including overshooting with the same prescription by @xcite ( @xmath54 in table .  1 ) .",
    "the critical distances we obtain are similar to the ones obtained in our models without overshooting @xmath69 .",
    "we believe that the major differences between ours and the @xcite models are a consequence of having transition between degenerate and non - degenerate cores at lower stellar masses , and that can not be attributable only to the inclusion of overshooting in the models .",
    "the stellar mass explicitly enters into the orbital evolution calculations , affecting the relative strength of the different terms in the angular momentum conservation equations ( with the exception of the drag and frictional forces ) .",
    "furthermore , the mass of the star affects both the evolution of the radius and the maximum radius reached at the end of the rgb .",
    "we have quantified the variations in the planet survival distance induced by the stellar mass in fig .",
    "[ fig_stmasas ] , where we show the final orbit reached by the planet ( @xmath70 ) versus the initial ( @xmath71 ) one .",
    "this figure is more easily interpreted if compared to fig .",

    "[ fig_stmasas ] represents the range of initial orbits that will end up at the stellar surface , the orbits that experience tidal decay but avoid engulfment are those beyond the inflection point in the figure , and finally those orbits that experience orbital expansion due to mass - loss are those that satisfy @xmath72 .",
    "the different colors represent the stellar mass ( see the legend at the top left corner of the plot ) .",
    "we have chosen for this plot stellar models with the reimers s mass - loss prescription and the @xmath0=0.2 parameter .",
    "all the orbits shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_stmasas ] have been integrated for a jupiter mass planet .",
    "final values of the orbital distance larger than the initial ones imply that a planet initially located at this distance will experience an expansion of the orbit ( note that the planets considered are very close to the star and unbinding is not expected ; e.g. @xcite ) . that is the case for initial orbital distances @xmath73 for all the masses .",
    "final orbital values smaller than the initial ones have two possible interpretations : ( i ) the planet has entered the stellar envelope and the final orbit simply reflects the value of the stellar radius ( where the calculation is terminated ) or ( ii ) the planet has suffered tidal decay reaching an orbit that avoided the stellar envelope when he - core ignition took place .",
    "these two scenarios are well separated in the plot by the inflection point in the curves .",
    "the main effect of varying the stellar mass is around the region in the plot where we find orbital decay but the planet avoids the stellar envelope .",
    "note that for initial orbits @xmath74 there is no difference in the final orbit induced by the stellar mass but around @xmath75 increasing the stellar mass leads to larger final orbital distances which translates into more chances for planet survival .",
    "a larger stellar mass decreases the influence of the mass - loss term ( and its tendency to move the orbit outward ) and decreases the strength of the tidal forces , effects that operate in opposite directions for planet survival ( see eq . [ todo ] ) .",
    "[ fig_stmasas ] shows that the stellar mass has a stronger influence through the tidal term than through the mass - loss term .",
    "this is reflected by the larger distance from the star cleared from planets ( smaller color area in fig .",
    "[ fig_stmasas ] ) result of the evolution of the stars with lower masses .",
    "note also that we have chosen the least favorable scenario , the models with the smallest mass - loss rates , to show this effect",
    ". the larger the area shown beyond the inflection point the better the chances for planet survival .      the dependency of the of planet survival on the rgb as a function of the planet mass using neptunian and 1 , 2 , 5 , and 10 m@xmath76 ( jupiter mass ) planets is shown in fig .  [ fig_plmasas ] for a 2 star with reimers mass - loss and @xmath0=0.2 .",
    "as already noted in vl09 , for a low mass planet to be engulfed , its initial separation needs to be smaller than that of a more massive planet .",
    "this is because at equal initial separation from the star , a more massive companion exerts a stronger tidal torque ( due to the dependency on @xmath77 in eq.[eq : adotstar ] , [ tidal ] ) .",

    "the main parameter affecting planet survival during the subgiant phase is the planet mass .",
    "more massive planets are more likely to plunge earlier into the stellar envelope .",
    "more massive planets are formed preferentially in more massive protoplanetary disks and thus those planets are expected around more massive stars .",
    "if more massive planets are present around subgiants with m @xmath64 1.5 then they could be brought into the stellar envelope early in the evolution if they are initially located at relatively close distance from the star and this could explain why they are not found in the @xmath111 orbital range .",
    "less massive planets are harder to detect around this systems .",
    "there is an observational bias associated with the large stellar jitter in evolved hosts that prevents the detection of low mass planets around evolved stars .",
    "in fact more massive planets are found on average orbiting evolved stars ( which , in principle , are more massive than the average main sequence planet hosts ) .",
    "the lack of observed planets around subgiants with m @xmath64 1.5 in the @xmath111 orbital range is hard to understand otherwise from an theoretical perspective .",
    "the rgb evolution is short compared to the ms lifetime , implying that the rgb region in the hr diagram is populated by stars of similar mass ( for a given initial chemical composition and age ) .",
    "masses for rgb ( planet hosting ) stars are computed from spectroscopic values of teff and metallicities that together with visual magnitude estimates are used to interpolate in theoretical stellar evolution grids .",
    "the uncertainties involved in the measured parameters are therefore relatively large .",
    "furthermore , the tracks for the different masses in the hr diagram are packed together and as a consequence , estimates of masses for rgb stars carry large uncertainties .",
    "uncertainties in mass are for the most part @xmath112 0.1 ( @xmath112 10% see e.g. @xcite ) with some objects having larger uncertainties ( up to 0.3 ) mostly caused from the lack of available hipparcos parallaxes @xcite .",
    "the stellar radius have the same dominant source for the uncertainty as the stellar mass and have values of @xmath57 615 % .",
    "we have shown that mass differences within the studies range do not have a strong influence on planet survival along the rgb and thus mass observed mass uncertainties should not have a strong influence in the outcome of the distribution of observed planets .",
    "it has been argued that the planet survival limit is rather sensitive to the host s star mass @xcite .",
    "while this is true when the stellar mass crosses from low to intermediate mass ( where the stellar core conditions change from degenerate to not degenerate ) , it is not true when low mass stars are involved . along these lines",
    "it is important to remember that while the rgb t@xmath113 at a given luminosity is only slightly sensitive to the value of the stellar mass , it is affected by the initial value of the metallicity @xmath114 . increasing @xmath114 moves the transition between low and intermediate mass stars towards higher masses .",
    "higher mass stars would ascend the rgb faster and grow smaller in radius ( note that this transition mass is set al 1.4 in @xcite where he argues for lower mass planet hosting evolved stars than claimed in the literature ) .",
    "our limit for he - flash stars is at 2.5 for [ fe / h]= 0.19 .",
    "it is the mass limit between degenerate and non - degenerate cores that strongly influences the planet survival limit during the rgb .",
    "close - in planets thus would have more chances to survive orbiting metal poor stars due to this effect . note the mass limit to build a degenerate core during the rgb is 1.5 for z=0.01 @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "we have shown that for a given mass - loss prescription , increasing the stellar mass puts more planets into the safe zone limit .",
    "this is because the stellar mass has a stronger influence ( through the tidal term ) than the mass - loss term .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_obsradio ] we show the distribution of stellar radi as a function of orbital separation for planets found in radial velocity surveys .",
    "the planets clearly occupy different regions according to the evolutionary status of the star . in this plot ,",
    "the striking feature is the lack of planetary systems found orbiting giant stars at large distances , beyond 3 au .",
    "there is nothing in principle that could cause this region to be depleted of planets unless stellar jitter is preventing the detection at large distances or planet searches around giant stars have not been carried long enough to recover this planet population present , on the other hand around ms stars .",
    "we find that all the observed systems are within the @xmath116 safe zone from tidal interaction we find from the calculation of the orbital evolution .    regarding the eccentricities of planet orbits , the observed distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ae ] . according to theoretical expectations",
    "giant stars being systems dominated by stellar tides tend to have @xmath94 and @xmath95 decaying at similar rates .",
    "it is expected therefore that planets experiencing tidal eccentricity decay would as well experience orbital decay and thus would not be observed .",
    "subgiants and ms stars on the other hand , could have experienced eccentricity decay but not substantial orbital decay , explaining the upper left corner clearance zone in the plot .    in summary ,",
    "our calculations show that rapid tidal orbital decay occurs when @xmath1173 .",
    "there are only 3 planets found orbiting rgb stars with @xmath11710 , and none has been found with @xmath1178 .",
    "the region @xmath65[0.08 , 0.5]au around subgiants is too wide to have been depleted of planets just by tidal effects , so the depletion must have other origins and can not be primordial since this planets have been found recently orbiting a - f ms stars using imaging techniques .",
    "a mass dependent mechanism must be at play that can only act in one way by building more massive planets are around more massive hosts that due to tidal forces are brought into the stellar envelope from larger initial orbital distances .",
    "the only way that makes sense is if the rgb stars are indeed higher mass , distinct from the ms planet hosts .",
    "if the rgb stars are low mass , as @xcite and @xcite argue , then there is no sensible way of accounting for the lack of close - in rgb planets since the stellar radius is too small to cause depletion by tidal forces ( unless the stellar radii are systematically underestimated , by a factor of 3 or more ) .",
    "in this work we have quantified the influence of different parameters on the survival of planets orbiting subgiant and red giant stars .",
    "we have explored a mass range for the hosts between 1.5 and 2 and find that during the subgiant phase planet survival is not substantially affected either by the stellar mass , or the adopted mass - loss prescription .",
    "the main parameter affecting planet survival during the subgiant phase is the planet mass , with more massive planets being more likely to plunge earlier into the stellar envelope .",
    "we find that even though the observed uncertainties in the determination of the stellar mass or mass - loss rates are quite large , those do not have much influence on the critical orbit beyond which a planet will survive rgb evolution . since tidal torques drop as a high negative power of the ratio of stellar radius to orbital separation , companions that escape engulfment experience essentially no tidal interactions if they are located beyond a certain initial orbit .",
