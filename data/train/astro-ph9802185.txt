    "groups and clusters of galaxies constitute cosmic structures sufficiently close to equilibrium and with sufficient density contrast ( @xmath7 inside the virial radius @xmath8 ) as to yield definite observables , and possibly to offer reliable signposts for cosmology .",
    "they stand out to substantial depths of space - time not only in the optical band , but even more in x",
    "this is because their gravitational potential wells , shaped by a dominant dark mass @xmath9 , contain not only baryons condensed into stars but also a larger amount of _ diffuse baryons_. the latter , with densities @xmath10 @xmath11 and virial temperatures @xmath12 kev in rich clusters , satisfy the plasma condition @xmath13 exceedingly well ; in fact , they do by a factor @xmath14 , vastly larger than for the baryons inside the stars . such a hot _ intra  cluster plasma _ ( icp ) emits powerful x - ray luminosities @xmath15 erg / s by optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung from central regions of overall radius @xmath16 mpc .",
    "the temperature directly probes the height of the potential well , with the baryons in the role of mere tracers ; on the other hand , the luminosity with its strong dependence on density reliably probes the baryonic content .",
    "statistically , a definite @xmath1 correlation is observed ( albeit with considerable scatter ) , and this provides the crucial link to relate the x - ray luminosity functions with the statistics of the dark mass @xmath9 or with that of the corresponding @xmath17 .",
    "but groups and clusters are intrinsically complex systems . to begin with",
    ", their dynamical history is marked by extensive , repeated _ merging _ of clumps , both in the form of nearly isotropic accretion of small units , and in the form of a few large , anisotropic coalescence events .",
    "this is shown in detail by all n - body simulations ( see , e.g. , schindler & mueller 1993 ; tormen 1997 ; roettiger , stone & mushotzky 1997 ) , and is increasingly indicated by the data ( see , e.g. , zabludoff & zaritsky 1995 ; henriksen & markevitch 1996 ; jones et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the timing of such a dynamical evolution ( and specifically the present merging rate ) is set by the _",
    "cosmological _ framework . adopting the homogeneous isotropic frw or lematre cosmologies",
    ", the expansion is parametrized by the hubble constant @xmath18 ( in units of 100 km / s mpc ) , and by the density parameter @xmath19 ( to which the baryons contribute the fraction @xmath20 ) ; a possible additional contribution is given by @xmath21 associated to the cosmological constant .",
    "given the cosmological framework , the _ cosmogony _",
    "( i.e. , the process of structure formation ) is treated in terms of the standard hierarchical clustering scenario ( see peebles 1993 ) , where all structures form by gravitational instability of initial density perturbations @xmath22 in the dark matter ( hereafter dm ) .",
    "important parameters are the shape of their power spectrum @xmath23 at the recombination , and the normalization measured at large scales by cobe / dmr ( gorsky et al .",
    "the transmission function @xmath24 depends on the specific model assumed for the dm ; given this , the amplitude @xmath25 ( i.e. , the normalization extrapolated down to the relevant scale @xmath26 mpc ) and the effective spectral slope @xmath27 depend on @xmath19 and @xmath18 .",
    "these parameters also affect the growth factor @xmath28 of the perturbations , which enters the actual predictions for the mass distributions of the condensed clusters or groups ( see appendix a ) .",
    "further complexity is added by the _ physics _ of the icp , and this constitutes our main aim here .",
    "to now , the ratio of the icp to dm , and specifically its central density @xmath29 and its effective radius are poorly understood .",
    "but the former is especially important , as the factor @xmath30 enters the luminosities and _ amplifies _ the observed variance .",
    "observational information on the icp and on the underlying dm dynamics is provided by the local @xmath1 correlation . at higher",
    "@xmath2 , further statistical information is provided by the evolution of the x - ray luminosity function @xmath31 , or by its integrals like the source counts or the @xmath2-distributions .",
    "the problem is that the predictions of observables involve not only the icp physics and the cosmogony ( with their intrinsic variances ) but also cosmology again ( with its uncertainties ) , and so the various aspects are not easily disentangled .",
    "the sharpest result obtained so far rules out the attractively simple assumption by kaiser ( 1986 ) that the icp amount be proportional to the dm s from groups to clusters at all @xmath2 and @xmath9 .",
    "a large number of subsequent works ( of which we cite here the recent mathiesen & evrard 1997 , kitayama & suto 1997 , and borgani et al .",
    "1998 ) dealt with the combinations of these three _ sectors _ , namely , cosmology , cosmogony and icp physics .",
    "but most of these papers , following the start by cavaliere & colafrancesco ( 1988 ) , approached the problem by parameterizing the dependences of the icp / dm ratio on @xmath9 and @xmath2 , e.g. , in the form @xmath32 . while the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 are constrained to some extent by the local @xmath1 correlation",
    ", nevertheless there still remains a substantial _ degeneracy _ ( oukbir , bartlett & blanchard 1997 ) between icp physics and cosmology / cosmogony .",
    "that is to say , different combinations of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath21 , @xmath20 , @xmath25 , @xmath35 , @xmath34 , @xmath33 provide close fits to the observables .",
    "conversely , when the icp parameters are varied , different cosmologies appear to be preferred by the data ; the trade off particularly concerns @xmath19 and @xmath36 , which directly govern the global and the icp evolution , respectively .    to go beyond such degeneracies",
    "a _ physical _ model is needed for the icp , including the above complexities .",
    "such a model must include : the histories of dm halos with their hierarchical merging events ; the infall of the gas with the ensuing compression and shocks ; the disposition of the icp in the potential wells ; its conditions at the boundary with the surrounding environment , which is modulated by the large scale structures and by stellar preheating . a model accounting for all the above is missing so far .",
    "we stress that the simulations using advanced hydrodynamics coupled with n  body codes hardly reach at present enough dynamic range ( as discussed by bryan & norman 1997 ) to describe dm and icp over the full range from @xmath37 mpc associated with the large scale structures ( which guide the ongoing mergers of dm halos ) , to the inner 50 kpc where the icp yields a considerable contribution to @xmath3 . on the other hand",
    ", such high - resolution simulations do not include yet the stellar preheating with its crucial effects on the lt relation .",
    "this motivates us to develop here a semi - analytical model which includes , though in a simplified form , the features listed above .",
    "we describe the cluster evolution as a sequence of _ punctuated equilibria _ ( pe ) ; that is to say , a sequence of hierarchical merging episodes of the dm halos ( computed with monte carlo simulations ) , associated in the icp to shocks of various strengths ( depending on the mass ratio of the merging clumps ) , which provide the boundary conditions for the icp to re - adjust to a new hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we show that our pe model predicts density and temperature profiles and the @xmath1 relation for clusters and groups consistent with the recent data .",
    "we then use our pe to predict the counts of resolved sources @xmath38 for faint fluxes down to @xmath39 erg / s @xmath40 , now accurately measured by rosati et al .",
    "we predict also the _ complementary _ observable constituted by the contribution of the unresolved groups and clusters to the soft x - ray background ( xrb ) .",
    "we predict the @xmath2-distributions , and finally the full @xmath2-resolved luminosity functions to be compared with recent and forthcoming surveys .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we present and discuss our approach to the icp astrophysics . in ",
    "3 we give the x - ray observables in the form suited to our hierarchical clustering computations ; details are supplied in the appendixes a , b and c. in  4 we present the results from our approach .",
    "the final  5 is devoted to discussions and conclusions .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of a cluster with radial temperature profile @xmath41 and density profile @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 the integration is over the emitting volume @xmath44 . expressing @xmath8 from @xmath45 , eq .",
    "( 1 ) recast into the form @xmath46 ^ 2}\\,t^2\\,\\rho^{1/2}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the internal dm density , @xmath48 is the density just exterior to the cluster boundary , and the bar indicates the integration over the cluster volume normalized to @xmath49 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( 2 ) applies in the isothermal case ; the corresponding expression for a polytropic icp is given in appendix b.    the simplest approach to the icp state is that adopted in the self ",
    "similar model ( kaiser 1986 ) where @xmath50 is assumed , independently of @xmath17 ; then @xmath51 obtains from eq .",
    "the result conflicts with the observed correlation for rich clusters which is close to @xmath52 ( edge & stewart 1991 ; mushotzky 1994 ; tsuru et al .",
    "1996 ; mushotzky & scharf 1997 ) .",
    "also , when combined with the standard hierarchical cosmogony , the assumption yields unacceptable fits to the local luminosity function ( see , e.g. , kitayama & suto 1997 ) .",
    "finally , it would predict the clusters at higher @xmath2 to comprise not only denser dm , but also equally denser icp ; since bremsstrahlung depends on @xmath53 , this would imply a strong positive evolution of @xmath31 , which is certainly _ not _ observed .",
    "rather , the analysis of the rosat brightest cluster sample ( ebeling et al .",
    "1997 ) and of the rosat deep cluster survey by rosati et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , extending and strengthening the data by collins et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and by nichol et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , indicate no evolution out to @xmath54 for @xmath55 erg / s ; earlier surveys ( emss , henry et al .",
    "1992 ) suggested even a ( marginal ) negative evolution of the bright clusters .",
    "so to derive the true _ scaling _ of @xmath3 with @xmath17 we need a closer analysis of the icp disposition relative to the dm .",
    "we propose a new approach based upon two cornerstones : the profiles @xmath42 and @xmath41 are given by the _",
    "hydrostatic _ equilibrium with the gradually changing gravitational potential ; their normalizations , and so the central density , are set by the conditions at the _ boundary _ with the external medium .",
    "the equilibrium profile may be effectively represented with a polytropic relation starting from the cluster boundary at @xmath56 , say : @xmath57^{1/(\\gamma-1)}~.\\ ] ] here @xmath58 is the temperature just interior to the boundary ; we conveniently use @xmath59 for the ratio of the interior to the exterior density , to include any shock discontinuity at the boundary .",
    "the appropriate values for @xmath60 will be discussed in  2.1 and  2.4 .    actually , the icp is reset to a _ new _ equilibrium after each episode of accretion or merging of further mass . in our pe approach ,",
    "the history of such episodes is followed in the framework of the hierarchical clustering by monte carlo simulations , as explained below .",
    "two relevant _ limiting _ forms of eq .",
    "( 3 ) are constituted by by the `` shock '' model of cmt97 , and by the `` adiabatic '' models of kaiser ( 1991 ) and of evrard & henry ( 1991 ) . in both the outer gas",
    "is expected to be _ preheated _ at @xmath61 kev ( ciotti et al .",
    "1991 ; david et al .",
    "1993 , 1995 ; renzini 1997 ) by @xmath62 , due to feedback energy inputs following star formation and evolution .",
    "preheating temperatures @xmath63 kev also would prevent the cooling catastrophe from occurring , see white & rees ( 1978 ) ; blanchard , valls gabaud & mamon ( 1992 ) . in point of fact ,",
    "henriksen & white ( 1996 ) find from x - rays evidence for diffuse cool gas at @xmath64 kev in the outer regions of a number of clusters . in the present context",
    ", preheating will inhibit the attainment of the universal baryonic density in gravitational wells with virial temperatures comparable to @xmath65 .",
    "these limiting models differ in their treatment of the boundary conditions and of the merging histories .",
    "the key boundary condition is provided by the dynamic stress balance @xmath66 , relating the exterior and interior pressures @xmath67 and @xmath68 to the inflow velocity @xmath69 driven by the gravitational potential at the boundary .",
    "we expect the inflowing gas to become supersonic in the vicinity of @xmath8 , when @xmath70 .",
    "in fact , many hydrodynamical simulations of loose gas accretion into a cluster ( from perrenod 1980 to takizawa & mineshige 1997 ) show shocks to form , to convert most of the bulk energy into thermal energy , and to expand slowly remaining close to the virial radius for some dynamical times .",
    "so we take @xmath71 ( which follows the structure growth , since @xmath72 ) , and focus on nearly static conditions inside , with @xmath73 .",
    "the post - shock state is set by conservations across the shock not only of the stresses , but also of mass and energy , as described by the rankine - hugoniot conditions ( see appendix b ) .",
    "these provide at the boundary the temperature jump @xmath74 , and the corresponding density jump @xmath75 which reads @xmath76^{1/2}\\ ] ] for a plasma with three degrees of freedom .",
    "( 4 ) includes both _",
    "weak _ and _ strong _ shocks . for weak shocks with @xmath77 ( appropriate for small groups accreting preheated gas , or for rich clusters accreting comparable clumps ) , this converges to the truly adiabatic relationship @xmath78 up to second order inclusive , see landau & lifshitz ( 1959 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it is shown in appendix b that for strong shocks ( appropriate to `` cold inflow '' as in rich clusters accreting small clumps and diffuse gas ) the approximation @xmath79 holds , where @xmath80 is the gravitational potential energy at @xmath81 .",
    "inside @xmath8 , the temperature and density profiles @xmath41 and @xmath42 are matched to @xmath58 and to @xmath82 by _ polytropic _ profiles or by their _",
    "isothermal _ limit .",
    "we numerically compute such profiles using the hydrostatic support of pressure against gravity ( see appendix b ) ; for definiteness , we use the navarro et al .",
    "( 1996 ) representation for the potential and for the velocity dispersion ( which varies slowly in the relevant region ) .",
    "let us consider first for reference the simple analytical approximation provided by the standard isothermal model @xmath83^\\beta \\ , , \\ ] ] ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) with the canonical exponent @xmath84 ; here @xmath85 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion at @xmath8 , and @xmath86 is the average molecular weight . for the purpose of the analytical approximation we may use the strong shock limit for @xmath58 , and find numerical values for @xmath87 ranging from about @xmath88 for groups to 0.9 for rich clusters ( a trend consistent with data being collected by m. girardi and coauthors , private communication ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath89 is larger in the former than in the latter ( see cmt97 ) .",
    "the full numerical computations using the expression for @xmath58 given in appendix b , and @xmath90 and @xmath91 from navarro et al .",
    "( 1996 ) confirm this trend and give results shown in fig .",
    "1 . note that even in the isothermal case the emission - weighted temperature ( integrated along the line of sight ) declines outwards but only very slowly .",
    "the observed stronger decline requires a polytropic equilibrium , where the run of @xmath41 steepens with the index @xmath60 increasing from 1 . in the appendix",
    "b we recall the basic relations , and show that the variations induced in the volume - averaged luminosity by increasing @xmath60 are small .",
    "thereafter , we adopt the value @xmath92 , which also yields for rich clusters an integrated baryonic fraction 0.15 out to @xmath8 . the result for",
    "the emission - weighted @xmath41 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) is a mild decrease out to @xmath93 1 mpc in agreement with the observations ( hughes , gorenstein & fabricant 1988 ; honda et al .",
    "1997 ; markevitch et al .",
    "1997 ) , followed by a sharper drop as indicated by state - of - the - art simulations ( e.g. , bryan & norman 1997 ) .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "1 the discontinuity at the shock has been smeared out to a smooth drop by the finite resolution , taken at 100 kpc for comparison with the simulations and with the forthcoming observations .",
    "the luminosity @xmath94 is statistically affected by the _ merging histories _ as follows . for a cluster or group of a given mass ( or temperature ) , the effective compression factor squared @xmath95 is obtained upon averaging eq .",
    "( 4 ) over the sequence of the dm merging events ; in such events , @xmath58 is the virial temperature of the receiving structure , and @xmath65 is the higher between the stellar preheating temperature and that from `` gravitational '' heating , i.e. , the virial value prevailing in the clumps being accreted .    all that is accounted for in our model using monte carlo simulations of the hierarchical growth of the dm halos ; these are based on merging trees corresponding to the excursion set approach of bond et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , consistent with the press & schechter ( 1974 ) statistics ( see cmt97 ) .",
    "the averaging procedure is dominated by the events occurring within the last few dynamical times ; it results in lowering @xmath95 compared to @xmath96 , because in many events the accreted gas is at a temperature higher than the minimum preheating value @xmath97 kev .",
    "in addition , an intrinsic _ variance _ is generated , reflecting and amplifying the variance intrinsic to the merging histories .",
    "the net result is shown in fig 2 , and commented in its caption . in agreement with the observations ( edge & stewart 1991 ; mushotzky 1994 ; tsuru et al . 1996 ; ponman et al .",
    "1996 ) , the _ shape _ of the average @xmath1 relation flattens from @xmath98 at the group scale ( where the nuclear energy from stellar preheating competes with the gravitational energy from infall ) to @xmath52 at the rich cluster scales . at higher temperatures the shape asymptotes to @xmath51 , the self - similar scaling of pure gravity .",
    "notice the intrinsic _ scatter _ due to the variance in the dynamical merging histories , but amplified by the @xmath53 dependence of @xmath3 .",
    "the average normalization formally rises like @xmath99 , where @xmath47 is the effective external mass density which increases as @xmath100 ( cavaliere & menci 1997 ) in filamentary large scale structures hosting most groups and clusters ( see ramella , geller & huchra 1992 ) .",
    "this implies a factor 1.3 at @xmath101 , consistent with the observations by mushotzky & scharf ( 1997 ) .",
    "further weakening of the @xmath2-dependence will comes from the increasing depth of the central @xmath102 for distant structures of given @xmath9 , as predicted by navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 ) .      at the other extreme ,",
    "the models by kaiser ( 1991 ) , and evrard & henry ( 1991 ) obtain from pe under two limits , appropriate only for rapidly expanding universes , as we discuss below .",
    "the first limit correspond to no currently active merging , with shocks moving outward and vanishing .",
    "in such conditions , at the boundary @xmath77 holds ; with @xmath65 staying nearly constant after the dynamical freeze out , this implies @xmath103 .",
    "correspondingly , the central density scales approximately as @xmath104 .",
    "the `` adiabatic '' models require also a second limit , concerning the internal gas distribution . the value @xmath105 is taken at the center , but an isothermal @xmath87 profile is assumed ( with a fixed @xmath87 ) , based on a king  like dm distribution .",
    "a constant baryonic fraction at @xmath8 is then required , and this forces the core radius to scale as @xmath106 .",
    "thus @xmath107 obtains , with the normalization @xmath108 .",
    "finally , the value of @xmath87 is chosen as an input .",
    "the choice @xmath109 for both clusters and groups leads to the model of evrard & henry ( 1991 ) , in which @xmath110 obtains , with constant normalization .",
    "the choice @xmath111 leads to the somewhat different model of kaiser ( 1991 ) , in which @xmath112 obtains , with the normalization anti - evolving like @xmath113 ; this will become even more negative when the evolution of @xmath114 is taken into account , so conflicting with the data of mushotzky & scharf ( 1997 ) .",
    "shock and adiabatic models can be characterized in terms of entropy ( see bower 1997 ) .",
    "actually , the modes of entropy production and distribution correlate with the global dynamics .",
    "collapses , merging and the induced shocks are currently ongoing in the _ critical _ universe , so that strong shocks form close to the virial radius .",
    "entropy is continuously generated in the outer regions , so that its radial distribution is raised outwards .",
    "then the effective @xmath60 will be close to one , leading to a roughly flat @xmath41 inside the shock .",
    "the density is determined by the boundary conditions after eqs .",
    "shocks are weaker in groups , the density profile is shallower , and the @xmath1 relation steeper .",
    "conversely , in an _ open _ universe most dynamical action is moved back to early times : merging and mixing occurred early on , and then subsided ; shocks had time to expand beyond @xmath8 and weaken ; correspondingly , the accretion petered out under nearly adiabatic conditions for groups and for clusters as well .",
    "then the effective @xmath60 is closer to @xmath115 , and this may be used to roughly scale the central densities with different virial temperatures @xmath17 to obtain @xmath116 .",
    "the two adiabatic models adopt additional , and different , assumptions concerning @xmath117 or @xmath118 , i.e. , @xmath119 , or @xmath120 , as discussed in  2.3 .    for open cosmologies with @xmath121 , or for flat ones with @xmath122 ,",
    "the present deceleration is _ intermediate _ between the two above cases , and the applicability of the shock or of the adiabatic model is not so clearcut ; we shall consider both , finding similar results as is expected .",
    "we use the dark mass @xmath123 normalized to the characteristic mass @xmath124 defined in the hierarchical clustering theory , see appendix a and the analytical details given in appendix c. the x - ray temperature @xmath17 reads : @xmath125 on the basis of  2 , for the shock model the bolometric luminosity is given by @xmath126 the ratio @xmath127 ( integrated over the cluster volume ) and the factor @xmath95 ( averaged over the merging histories ) have been derived in  2.2 .",
    "the constant @xmath128 takes on the value @xmath129 kev ( see appendix c ) . the luminosity @xmath130 is calibrated on the height of the observed , local @xmath1 correlation ( see fig .",
    "2 ) rather than computed a priori , in view of the subtleties discussed in  5 . at 4.5 kev",
    "we find @xmath131 erg / s .",
    "the height of the local luminosity function provides an independent value for the normalization , which we find consistent with the former to within @xmath132% .",
    "the statistics at different @xmath2 of dm halos in the hc theory is provided by the standard press & schechter ( 1974 ) formula , which in comoving form ( @xmath133 being the local cosmological density ) reads : @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the critical threshold for the collapses of the density perturbations ( depending weakly on the cosmological parameters ) ; on the other hand , @xmath28 is the linear growth factor for the density perturbations , sensitively depending on the cosmological parameters ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the linear , time - evolved mass variance @xmath136 is usually represented in the form @xmath137 where @xmath138 contains the effective slope @xmath139 of the power spectrum @xmath140 at scales @xmath141 mpc .",

    "thus a _ complementarity _ relationship holds between the counts and the contribution to the xrb .",
    "if one limits the number of resolved sources in the counts by assuming , e.g. , a stricter surface brightness selection , as discussed later on , then all sources pronounced unresolved will contribute to the xrb .",
    "the joint consideration of these two observables is thus expected to give robust constraints .",
    "in the luminosity functions @xmath31 the luminosities are reduced to the rosat band for comparison with the data .",
    "the derivation of the temperature function @xmath152 involves only eqs .",

    ", they depend also on the full shape of the power spectrum , which is determined in turn by @xmath154 and ( weakly ) by @xmath20 , but does _ not _ depend directly on @xmath21 ( although its normalization does ) .",
    "we note that @xmath153 and @xmath25 decrease with @xmath19 decreasing , and by themselves tend to decrease all numbers ; however , this is delicately balanced by the increase of the distances and by the slower ( negative ) evolution , as discussed in more detail in  4.4 . with @xmath155",
    "the amplitude @xmath25 is larger , and this also enters the results as discussed in  4.3 .    as for the cosmological parameters , we conservatively adopt combinations of @xmath18 and @xmath154 yielding for the present age of the universe @xmath156 gyr ( see ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ) . on the other hand , many x - ray measurements in clusters give a considerable ratio @xmath157 of the baryons to dark matter ; as rich clusters are likely to constitute fair samples of the universe , an abundance ratio @xmath158 is indicated ( white et al .",

    "1997 , and the higher @xmath2 sample by rosati et ( 1997 ) .      for the tcdm , we adopt the tilted primordial spectral index @xmath164 and the amplitude @xmath169 , with a high baryonic fraction @xmath170 , in the critical universe with hubble constant @xmath161 .",
    "the tilt is chosen following white et al .",
    "( 1996 ) so as to minimize one of the main problems of the standard cdm , namely , the excess of small - scale power , still retaining a value for @xmath18 rather low but still not inconsistent with current observations .",
    "in addition , such a cosmogony includes the high baryonic fraction referred to above .",
    "we recall that such parameter set is hard pressed in terms of the low value of @xmath171 , and of the primordial abundance implied for light elements , with that of he exceeding many recent measurements ; the debate is still hot on the related issue of the @xmath172 ratio , with recent signs of convergence , see tytler , fan & burles ( 1996 ) ; songaila , wampler & cowie ( 1997 ) .    after  2.4 we consider here only the pe model with the full range of shock strengths . in fig .",
    "3a we compare the _ local _ luminosity function with the current data ; it is seen that an acceptable fit obtains only at the lower @xmath173 standard deviations in @xmath25 .",

    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the evolution of the temperature function is characterized by a fast decrease out to a moderate @xmath2 in the number of high-@xmath17 ( massive ) clusters .",
    "this is within the reach of sax ( piro et al .",
    "1997 ) and xmm ( mason et al .",

    "the counts are shown in fig .",
    "the fit of the predicted counts to the bright data reflects the acceptability of the fit to the local luminosity function .",
    "note that the slope of predicted counts is sufficiently _ flat _ to fit both the bright and the faint data by lowering @xmath25 to within the cobe uncertainty .",
    "alternatively , a similar result is obtained on using the central value of @xmath25 from cobe , but the higher baryon abundance @xmath174 .    our computation of the soft xrb ( see fig .",
    "3d ) comprises , as said above , the sources fainter than @xmath175 erg / s @xmath40 .",
    "our predictions are compared with the residual xrb from rosat , once the agns contribution ( @xmath176 70 % at 1 kev , see hasinger 1996 ) has been _ subtracted _ out .",
    "the computed curve lies below the upper bounds .      as said ,",
    "open universes with @xmath178 apparently constitute the simplest way out of the baryonic crisis .",
    "however , it is seen in fig .",
    "4 that cobe  normalized cosmogonies with @xmath179 using the adiabatic model for the icp , suffer from the fatal flaw of severely underpredicting both the local functions of temperature and luminosity . the blame stays mainly with the dynamical sectors ; specifically , the low spectral amplitude @xmath25 yields a severe deficit in @xmath180 , and correspondingly a deficit in the bright counts .",
    "similar dynamical reasons yield in aimed n - body simulations a percentage of complex morphologies lower than observed in the local clusters ( west , jones & forman 1995 ; mohr et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "on the other hand , intermediate values of @xmath19 are still a possibility .",
    "after liddle et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the range allowed to the class of open cosmologies by a set of observational constraints , including @xmath181 and the cobe normalization , is narrowed down to vicinity of @xmath177 .",
    "we focus first on the representative ocdm cosmogony , with @xmath182 , @xmath183 with @xmath184 , which yield @xmath185 .    here",
    "it is not easy to decide a priori whether the pe or the adiabatic model applies better to the icp , so we use both , ending up in similar results as expected .",
    "these are shown in figs .",
    "5a , 5b , 5c , 5d .",
    "it is seen that the local distributions are well fitted , but the integrated observables show excesses over the data .",
    "these persist when other values of @xmath19 around @xmath186 are used , and when the uncertainties in @xmath25 and @xmath153 are considered , as discussed in  4.4 .",
    "`` intermediate '' conditions for the cosmic deceleration also obtain when @xmath187 is accepted , with a flat geometry as in most variants of inflation .",
    "the values @xmath6 and @xmath166 , with @xmath188 and @xmath189 , match many observational evidences ( see ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ) .",
    "following klypin , primack and holtzman ( 1997 ) , here the normalization is @xmath190",
    ".    here as in the previous case we have to consider both the pe and the adiabatic model .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "6a and 6b the local luminosity and temperature functions , while in figs . 6c and",
    "6d we plot the predicted counts and the contribution to the soft xrb .      here",
    "we give results covering the full set of cobe - normalized cdm cosmogonies . for a synthetic presentation , in figs . 7a and 7b we compare the predictions for the counts at bright ( @xmath191 erg / s @xmath40 ) and at faint fluxes ( @xmath192 erg / s @xmath40 ) with the data .",
    "we also show the effects of varying @xmath25 within the uncertainty associated with cobe data , and @xmath153 within the minimum dispersion intrinsic to the @xmath1 relation .",
    "note in the figures that the strips corresponding to the uncertainties narrow down at the upper edge , because @xmath25 ( entering inversely the expression for @xmath193 ) increases with @xmath19 .",
    "similarly , @xmath193 is larger for the tcdm cosmogony compared with standard cdm , due to the smaller value of @xmath25 .",
    "our results agree with liddle et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in ruling out @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "even in the remaining range our results compare critically with the data , because on fine ",
    "tuning @xmath19 toward @xmath196 the local luminosity function and the bright counts turn out to be underestimated ; on the other hand , as soon as @xmath168 is approached , an acceptable fit to the local luminosity function is recovered , but an excess in the faint counts is generated ( see fig .",
    "5 ) , especially with the adiabatic model . in summary ,",
    "agreement with _ both _ the brigth and the faint data is at best marginal ; the underlying reason is that in open cosmologies long lines of sight and slow dynamical evolution conspire to yield a slope of the counts too _ steep _ to account for _ both _ faint and bright counts .",
    "we note that such a slope would be even increased on considering that the formation @xmath2 is always larger than @xmath2 at observation , which has the affect of steepening , if only slightly , the luminosity functions ( cavaliere , colafrancesco & menci 1993 ; kitayama & suto 1997 ) . note also that the addition of @xmath166 to @xmath6 implies a higher value of @xmath25 and hence a higher levels of faint counts , though lower than in the @xmath168 case .    in figs .",
    "7 we also show that the counts in tcdm critical and in @xmath167cdm cosmogonies / cosmologies can be made consistent with the observations on considering not only their uncertainties , but also those in the present cobe normalization and the intrinsic uncertainty in the @xmath3-@xmath17 relation , see the discussion following eq .",
    "overall , a common feature of all the above models based on canonical hierarchical clustering , is constituted by some _ excess _ in the counts ; only in the critical and in the flat geometry this can be brought to consistency with the data .",
    "this may indicate some non  trivial incompleteness in the canonical hierarchical clustering , worth keeping under scrutiny .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "8 the results for the contribution to the soft xrb , e.g. , at @xmath197 kev . once again",
    ", cdm with @xmath198 is ruled out , while @xmath177 is marginal also in this respect .",
    "could excess faint counts be reduced by considering a stronger selection due to surface brightness ?",
    "on the contrary , we stress that the complementarity with the contribution to xrb makes any such excess even more significant .",
    "in fact , a solution can not be sought in terms of surface brightness selections without increasing the excess contribution to the xrb from the unresolved groups and clusters .",
    "in this paper we have computed the x - ray observables for groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "as anticipated in the introduction , we use  rather than continuous and possibly degenerate parametrizations  only discrete combinations of _ physical _ models appropriate for the dark matter and for the intra - cluster plasma .",
    "we first list our results , and then discuss them in detail .    we have developed the punctuated equilibria ( pe ) model for the icp state and dynamics .",
    "this is comprised of the following two components .    as for _ single _ clusters ,",
    "we have used a polytropic @xmath87-model which yields temperature profile @xmath41 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) in good agreement with the observations .",
    "we predict the icp density profile @xmath42 and the brightness profile to be flatter for groups than for clusters , corresponding to a larger extension of the icp relatively to their gravitational radii .    as for _ statistics _ , we convolved the icp equilibria with the histories of dm halos , and predicted the @xmath1 correlation to take the form shown in fig .",
    "2 , in agreement with the data . in addition , we predicted an _",
    "intrinsic _ variance with the minimum value also represented in fig .",
    "2 .    based on our pe model",
    "we then proceeded to compute for various standard cosmological frameworks the local and the evolved _",
    "luminosity functions _ of galaxy clusters , that we compared with the data ( fig .",
    "3a , 4 , 5a , 6a ) .",
    "we derived also the number counts ( fig .",
    "3c , 5c , 6c ) , the @xmath2-distributions ( fig . 9 ) and",
    "the contribution to the soft x - ray background ( fig .",
    "3d , 5d , 6d ) .",
    "our results are summarized in figs . 7a and 7b ; these show that the set of acceptable cosmogonies / cosmologies is restricted to three disjoint _ domains _ : @xmath199 for the standard cdm ; @xmath200 for the tilted cdm ; @xmath201 for cdm in flat geometry . in fig .",
    "9 we summarize the _ confidence _ levels at which the data are matched .",
    "we next proceed to discuss in detail the results listed above .",
    "the icp _ state _ in the hierarchically evolving gravitational wells constitutes the focus of our new approach .",
    "we propose that such state follows suit , passing through a sequence of _ punctuated equilibria _ ( pe ) that we compute semi - analytically .",
    "these computations comprise : the merging histories of the dm potential wells , obtained with a large statistics from monte carlo simulations of the hierarchical clustering ; the inner _ hydrostatic _ equilibrium disposition , updated after each merging episode ; and the _ boundary _ conditions provided by strong and weak shocks , or even by a closely adiabatic compression , depending on the ratio of the infall to the thermal energy in the preheated external medium .",
    "the results of our model depend on two parameters , the external temperature @xmath65 and density @xmath48 , which are _ not _ free .",
    "specifically , we use for @xmath65 the lower bound @xmath202 kev provided by the literature on stellar preheating ; in the merging events the effective @xmath65 is the virial temperature of the incoming clumps , when this is larger than 0.5 kev .",
    "the value of @xmath48 for rich clusters is related to the dm density by the universal baryonic fraction @xmath203 .",
    "note that our pe model does not require strict spherical symmetry , but rather that the residual internal velocities be smaller than the inflow velocity .",
    "so they can include merging episodes ranging from nearly isotropic accretion of small clumps and diffuse gas , to anisotropic coalescence of comparable clumps along filaments of the large scale structures .",
    "the expression of the bolometric luminosity is proportional to @xmath204 , the square of the density jump at the bounding shock .",
    "the average of such factor over the merging histories is what gives to the statistical @xmath1 correlation the _ curved _ shape shown in fig .",
    "2 . for rich clusters",
    "we obtain @xmath52 .",
    "this flattens to @xmath51 for larger @xmath17 , corresponding to the saturation of the shock compression factor , i.e. , @xmath205 when @xmath206 . at the other end ,",
    "the correlation steepens to @xmath98 in the group range , where @xmath207 and the shocks are substantially weakened by the preheating temperature in the infalling clumps .",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath1 correlation rises gently proportionally to @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the density in the large scale structures hosting clusters and groups .",
    "in addition , our pe approach predicts an intrinsic _ variance _ of dynamical origin due to the different merging histories , and built in the factor @xmath96 .",
    "such variance constitutes a lower bound , in view of additional contributions from the variance in the ambient density , and from the central luminosity associated with cooling flows ( fabian et al .",
    "1994 ; white , jones & forman 1997 ) .",
    "the pe model includes , in a simplified semi - analytical form , compression and shocks at the boundary with the surrounding environment , which is modulated in density by the large scale structure and in temperature by the stellar preheating .",
    "simulations now clearly show the _ shocks _ occurring also in major merging events ( schindler & mueller 1993 ; roettiger , stone & mushotzky 1997 ) .",
    "the inclusion of the rankine - hugoniot conditions rises the internal temperature at the expenses of the inflow velocities .",
    "complex features are found like residual kinetic pressures , and unmixed hot spots in the temperature distribution ; but over times of about 2 gyr the residual kinetic pressure over cluster scales reduces to less than 20 % of the thermal one .    on the other hand , in the hierarchical clustering",
    "such major events are rare ; our monte carlo simulations give a probability @xmath210 for very asymmetric events with mass ratios 2:1 or larger occurring within 2 gyr from the cluster observation .",
    "in addition , in such events the icp temperature in the infalling subcluster is comparable to the virial value in the main cluster . such major events with their low frequency and large @xmath65 yield a minor contribution to the _ statistical _ @xmath211 .",
    "our semi - analytical model describes only crudely these transient if conspicuous features , to focus on the lesser and more symmetric events which contribute the most to the @xmath1 relation .",
    "at the extreme of spherical accretion of loose gas the simulations ( see takizawa & mineshige 1997 ) show in detail that _ shocks _ also form and expand slowly , to leave inside a declining temperature profile and a steeper density profile .",
    "our pe model yields temperature profiles _ decreasing _ as shown in fig .",
    "these agree with the published data ( see hughes et al .",
    "1988 ; honda et al . 1997 ; markevitch et al .",
    "1997 ) ; they agree also with the results from state - of - the - art simulations ( bryan & norman 1997 ) obtained by running on supercomputers advanced 3d eulerian codes with adapting mesh and reliable shock capturing methods . while the high - resolution simulations are limited ( for now and for some time to come ) to the condition of no stellar preheating suitable only for very rich clusters , our model includes the effects of stellar preheating of the outer gas over the whole range from groups to clusters .",
    "with the icp state so described , we proceeded to constrain the cosmological parameters . after the observations by rosati et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the main rule of the game turns out to be as follows : the dynamical evolution contained in the standard press & schechter formula ( eq .",
    "9 ) must _ combine _ with the evolution of the @xmath1 correlation and with cosmology to yield closely non - evolutionary @xmath31 .",
    "we stress that such combinations are severely selected in our approach .",
    "in fact , strong _ shocks _ are common in the _ critical _ cosmology , where accretion and merging activity are currently ongoing , and there _ shocks _ apply in full ; these include also weak shocks for small groups with virial temperatures below 1 kev , and for those rich clusters which merge with comparable clumps . closely _",
    "compressions , instead , prevail for all structures in very _ open _ universes with high formation redshifts , and little or no strong shocks and mixing at present .",
    "this defines the domain of applicability of the two adiabatic models by kaiser ( 1991 ) and evrard & henry ( 1991 ) .    in detail ,",
    "our results are as follows ( see fig",
    "we confirm that standard cdm in the _ critical _ cosmology is definitely ruled out on account of its overproduction of local clusters and of their considerable positive evolution .",
    "we also rule out _ open _ cosmologies with @xmath212 , the simplest way to enforce little evolution and also to provide a solution to the baryonic crisis .",
    "in fact , these cosmologies when cobe - normalized yield a severe deficit in the local luminosity function and in the source counts .",
    "thus , we investigated more _",
    "elaborate _ solutions : the critical universe with tilted cdm and a high baryon content ; and two cases of intermediate deceleration , comprising cdm with canonical nucleosynthesis either in mildly open universes with @xmath168 , or in flat geometry with @xmath6 and @xmath166 .    with the first solution we obtain ( marginally ) acceptable results ( see figs .",
    "3a-3c ) for the local luminosity function @xmath213 , for the source counts , and for the contribution to the soft xrb , within the present uncertainties of the data and within the variance intrinsic to the theory .",
    "we note that the cosmological / cosmogonical sectors by themselves may be tested independently , based on the fast evolution with @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "3b ) of the temperature distribution in the critical case , as pointed out by many authors ( see oukbir & blanchard 1992 ; henry 1997 ) ; this constitutes an important program for the satellites sax and xmm    as for comologies with _ intermediate _ deceleration , here neither the pe nor the adiabatic models for the icp are cogently indicated ; thus we considered both , obtaining generally similar results as expected . for open cosmologies in particular , the results are inconsistent with the observations of the local luminosity function and of the counts , except for the range @xmath214 ; even there the counts are excessive at more than the formal @xmath215% confidence level ( see fig .",
    "9 ) , the excess being larger for the adiabatic models .",
    "the excess is due to built  in reasons , that is , the relative large amplitude @xmath25 and the relatively steep shape of the counts , as spelled out in  4.4 . instead ,",
    "in the @xmath216 cosmology a manageable count excess is obtained .",
    "we note that the kaiser s ( 1991 ) variant of the adiabatic models does not yield such an excess for @xmath168 , due to its normalization decreasing at high @xmath2 . however , the local luminosity function computed from this model overestimates the number of brightest clusters , due to the strong dependence @xmath217 .",
    "moreover , the normalization decrease at high @xmath2 is hardly consistent with the data by mushotzky and scharf ( 1997 ) .",
    "finally , it yields a fast , negative evolution of @xmath31 barely consistent with the data in the survey by rosati et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ( the deficit is truly fatal in the critical or in the flat cosmology ) . as luminosities larger than some @xmath218 erg sec@xmath219 are little represented in that survey , a strong test for such a negative evolution concerns any deficit at bright fluxes in the redshift distribution from a large  area survey .",
    "so we show in fig .",
    "10 the redshift distribution computed also for this model .",
    "we have conservatively chosen to focus on a limiting flux @xmath220 erg sec@xmath219 for which the sky coverage is nearly @xmath221% ( p. rosati , private communication ) , and any incompleteness is out of question .",
    "incompleteness due to surface brightness may be relevant at fainter fluxes , depending on the cluster and group profiles .",
    "we plan to treat such issue elsewhere , but here we point out that in our approach the impact of any such incompleteness is limited by the _ complementarity _ between counts of resolved sources and contribution to the xrb from the rest .",
    "our summary is that many combinations of standard cosmogonies / cosmologies with icp models are ruled out .",
    "a relatively _ small _ set of disjoint cosmologies / cosmogonies survive , as shown by fig .",
    "7 : @xmath200 with tilted cdm and high baryonic abundance combined with the punctuated equilibria , which is marginally consistent with the data ; cdm in open cosmology with @xmath222 , which is barely consistent using the pe , and even less so using the adiabatic models ; cdm with @xmath6 and @xmath166 , which is consistent using either the pe and the adiabatic models .    so cosmological parameters can be constrained on the basis of x  ray clusters , but only _ up to a point _ ; for example , the residual uncertainty in the density parameter is @xmath223 .      to what extent enlarging the data base on x  ray clusters will help in further constraining cosmology ?",
    "here we argue that the variance intrinsic to the hierarchical clustering , and amplified by the icp emissivity , sets an effective _ limitation_. in fact , fig .",
    "7 shows that the present poissonian error bars in the observed faint counts are already smaller than the ( minimum ) intrinsic variance in the predicted ones . decreasing the former with richer , faint surveys will hardly provide a sharper insight into cosmology unless one reduces both the uncertainty concerning @xmath25 and the larger one concerning @xmath153 ;",
    "in fact , the two enter with comparable weights eq .",
    "( 10 ) , since it is seen that @xmath224 acts roughly as @xmath225 .",
    "to what point are these reductions feasible ? on the theoretical side , the minimum @xmath226 of dynamical origin may be sharpened by monte carlo simulations so extensive as to provide the full scatter distribution .",
    "but then one must tackle also the enhanced emissivity produced or signaled by cooling flows , correlated with higher ambient densities ; this we shall treat elsewhere ( cavaliere menci & tozzi , in preparation ) .    on the observational side",
    ", one needs a large statistics for the distributions of @xmath3 and @xmath17 ; this will help in deriving narrower @xmath1 correlations for subsamples categorized in term of mass deposition rates from cooling flows , see white , forman & jones ( 1997 ) .",
    "such aim calls for spectroscopic measurements of @xmath17 , which are obviously harder than the bolometric @xmath3 , and require sax or even xmm",
    ". however , we stress that such efforts will find soon a more _ proper _ aim than constraining @xmath19 .",
    "this is because soon map ( bennett et al . 1997 ) , and subsequently planck ( bersanelli et al . 1996 ) , will accurately measure on very large and still linear scales not only the perturbation power spectrum ( from which @xmath25 is derived ) , but also directly @xmath19 to better that 10% ; this will supersede constraints set at cluster scales gone _ non - linear_.    once the cosmological framework has been fixed , the study of groups and clusters in x - rays will resume what we submit to be its proper course ; that is , the physics of systems of intermediate _ complexity _ which is comprised of the dm and of the icp component .    with the latter fully understood and the scatter in the @xmath1 relation assessed , cluster x",
    " raying will finally expose the underlying process of _ non - linear _ condensation of dm on scales @xmath0 mpc .",
    "then any mismatch concerning the number counts or @xmath31 will be telling of failures either in the cdm spectra or in the current representation of cosmogony in terms of the press & schechter formula .    as a relevant example",
    ", we recall from  4.4 that even the acceptable models we computed tend to exceed the observed faint counts , and can be brought to consistency only at the lower end of the current uncertainty concerning @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",
    "the corrections to the press & schechter formula currently discussed yield a larger number of clusters .",
    "for example , jain & bertschinger ( 1995 ) , and gardner , tozzi & governato ( 1998 ) find that the threshold @xmath227 must be lowered from the canonical value 1.69 to 1.5 , at least at @xmath228 if not already at @xmath229 ; a similar trend obtains considering that the formation redshift is always greater than the observation s as discussed in  4.4 .",
    "if map will provide definite values of @xmath35 , @xmath25 and @xmath19 such as to enhance the excess in the faint counts , then the press & schechter rendition of the non - linear cosmogony will have to be reconsidered .",

    "<S> to predict the x - ray observables associated with the diffuse baryons in clusters of galaxies , we develop a new physical model for such a hot intra - cluster plasma . </S>",

    "<S> this comprises the following blocks that we compute in detail : monte carlo `` merging histories '' to describe the dynamics of dark matter condensations on scales of order @xmath0 mpc , and the associated evolution of the gravitational potential wells ; the central _ hydrostatic _ disposition for the icp , reset to a new equilibrium after each merging episode ; conditions of shock , or of closely adiabatic compression at the _ boundary _ with the external gas , preheated by stellar energy feedbacks . </S>",
    "<S> shocks of substantial strength are shown to prevail at the outskirts of rich clusters in a universe with decelerated expansion .    from our model </S>",
    "<S> we predict the @xmath1 relation , consistent with the data as for shape and scatter . </S>",
    "<S> this we combine with the mass distribution provided by the canonical hierarchical clustering ; the initial perturbation spectra are dominated by cold dark matter but include enough baryons to account for the high abundance sampled by the x  ray clusters , and are cobe  normalized . </S>",
    "<S> thus we predict the @xmath2-resolved luminosity functions , with the associated source counts and redshift distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we predict also the complementary contribution by the unresolved groups and clusters to the soft x - ray background .    </S>",
    "<S> these results are compared with two recent surveys from rosat ; one defines the local luminosity function over nearly three decades of @xmath3 , and the other shows little or no evolution out to @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> our results confirm that the critical cosmology coupled with standard cdm is ruled out by its overproduction of local clusters . on account of underproduction , instead , we rule out open cosmologies ( the cheapest way to solve the baryonic crisis and to freeze evolution ) , except for a narrow range around @xmath5 ; even there , we find the consistency with the full data base to be hardly marginal . for the cdm cosmogony with @xmath6 but in flat geometry , we obtain acceptable fits . for the tilted cdm perturbation spectrum with high baryonic content in the critical universe , we obtain marginal consistency . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmogonical / cosmological sectors of the cluster history are independently testable by means of a lower bound to the evolved temperature distribution , as can be measured with sax and xmm out to moderate @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the effective limitations of x - ray clusters and groups as cosmological signposts , and their brighter prospects toward the astrophysics of the icp and the cosmogony of large , high  contrast structures . </S>"
