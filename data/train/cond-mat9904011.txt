    "@xcite we have computed the form of the corrections to the scaling limit , and the correction - to - scaling exponent , for a number of systems with nonconserved order parameter .",
    "these include some exactly soluble models , and the model a dynamics of a scalar field within the mazenko theory .    in the present work we turn our attention to systems with a vector order parameter , both nonconserved and conserved .",
    "the corrections to scaling for systems with continuous symmetry will be calculated using the mazenko theory .",
    "it should be mentioned that this approach has been shown to be more successful , at a quantitative level , in systems with nonconserved order parameter than those with conserved order parameter @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the results obtained in the conserved case are in qualitative agreement with those obtained in simulations .",
    "furthermore , the mazenko approach seems the only available method to probe the questions of corrections to scaling addressed here .",
    "in particular , we found that , for nonconserved scalar fields , the correction - to - scaling exponent @xmath3 is predicted by this approach to have a nontrivial value . we will show that this same feature is present for the vector fields , with and without conservation .",
    "it is well established @xcite that at late times most phase - ordering systems approach a scaling regime , where the equal - time pair correlation function @xmath7 takes the form @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "the characteristic length scale @xmath9 grows with time as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the growth exponent which depends on the nature of the dynamics and the symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "in particular , @xmath12 for nonconserved order parameter systems , while @xmath13 for systems with conserved scalar order parameter and @xmath14 for systems with conserved vector order parameter ( with logarithmic corrections for @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xcite ) . in previous work @xcite we studied how scaling is approached in nonconserved order parameter models such as the 1-@xmath5 ising model with glauber dynamics , the @xmath17vector model with @xmath18 , the approximate ojk theory and the mazenko theory for scalar fields . in all these cases",
    "@xmath3 was found to be trivial ( @xmath19 ) except the last , for which @xmath3 was found to be non - trivial and dimensionality dependent .",
    "the relevance of corrections to scaling lies in interpreting experimental and simulation results , where it is advantageous to know how the scaling limit is approached .",

    "the main objective in this article is to study systems with @xmath23 .",
    "this article is devoted to the study of the corrections to scaling for systems with @xmath0 symmetry in phase - ordering dynamics .",
    "the leading corrections to scaling enter the correlation function in the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the ` scaling function ' and @xmath4 the ` correction - to - scaling function ' . the quantity which unites theory ,",
    "computer simulation and experiment is the structure factor @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the @xmath5-dimensional fourier transforms of @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively , and @xmath31 .",
    "coniglio and zannetti @xcite solved the conserved @xmath0 model for @xmath18 exactly , and found that no simple scaling exists .",
    "instead a ` multiscaling ' behavior was obtained , raising the question of whether simple scaling exists in conserved order parameter systems with @xmath32 generally ( or even for conserved scalar fields ) .",
    "however , it was later shown by bray and humayun @xcite , analytically within the mazenko theory , that scaling does exist for large but finite @xmath6 . attempts to find multiscaling behaviour in simulation date for conserved scalar fields @xcite , or the conserved xy model in two @xcite or three @xcite dimensions were not successful .",
    "it is now generally believed that scaling is recovered asymptotically in time in the conserved @xmath0 model , for all finite @xmath6 , though multiscaling may be observable in the preasymptotic regime @xcite .",
    "there are other sources of corrections to scaling apart from the one considered in this paper . in phase - ordering systems there is , in addition to the time - dependent coarsening scale @xmath9 , a second characteristic length scale  the ` defect core size ' @xmath33  in systems with topological defects .",
    "the corrections to scaling associated with nonzero defect core size ( where @xmath33 is the domain wall thickness in scalar systems ) are expected to enter as a power of @xmath34 .",
    "here we are interested primarily in the corrections to scaling associated with non - scaling initial conditions .",
    "we therefore suppress the contributions associated with nonzero core size @xmath33 by taking the ` hard - spin ' limit , i.e.  working with an order - parameter field whose length is everywhere unity , @xmath35 , which forces @xmath36 ( though in the mazenko theory this limit will be taken at the end ) .",
    "also thermal fluctuations at @xmath37 may give rise to significant corrections to scaling for systems quenched to a nonzero final temperature @xmath38 @xcite ( where @xmath39 , with @xmath40 the critical temperature ) as has been shown explicitly in the nonconserved @xmath0 model with @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "however , we will only be studying systems quenched to @xmath42 . although corrections to scaling due to thermal fluctuations and nonzero @xmath33 are important we will not consider them further in this paper .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the following section",
    "the approximate mazenko theory is discussed and some general concepts are introduced . section iii deals with nonconserved order parameter systems . in section iv ,",
    "corrections to scaling for the nonconserved 1-@xmath5 xy model will be studied .",
    "systems with conserved order parameter are considered in section v. section vi concludes with a summary and discussion .",
    "a ` gaussian closure ' theory , building on the earlier work of ohta , jasnow and kawasaki @xcite has been developed by mazenko @xcite .",

    "the other three solutions are obtained by substituting ( [ asymp ] ) into ( [ live ] ) and carrying out an asymptotic large-@xmath109 analysis , leading to the relations @xmath223 the three different solutions correspond to the three solutions for @xmath224 , one real , two complex .",
    "the real solution , @xmath225 , leads to an exponentially diverging solution for @xmath144 : @xmath226 while the two complex roots , @xmath227 , generate two solutions which can be combined to give an exponentially decaying solution with oscillatory behaviour @xmath228 where @xmath229 and @xmath230 are arbitrary constants .",
    "just as in the model a case , where @xmath122 was fixed by imposing physical conditions on the large-@xmath109 solution , also in this case we have an eigenvalue problem in which two parameters @xmath217 and @xmath218 are chosen to eliminate the unphysical constant solution and the exponentially diverging solution .",
    "the same problem is encountered in model b with a scalar order parameter @xcite . applying the procedure described in @xcite it is possible to determine @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "turning now to the corrections to scaling , we consider first the four linearly independent large-@xmath109 solutions for the linearised form of eq .",
    "( [ lncf ] ) .",
    "these are a power law solution , @xmath231 , an exponentially growing solution , @xmath232 , and two decaying solutions that can be combined in the form @xmath233 where @xmath234 is arbitrary , and @xmath235 if @xmath236 and @xmath237 otherwise .",
    "the small-@xmath109 solution is @xmath238 .",
    "therefore ( [ lncf ] ) is solved numerically with initial conditions @xmath239 , @xmath240 . the two parameters @xmath241 and @xmath3 are as yet undetermined .",
    "they are fixed in the same way as @xmath217 and @xmath218 , by requiring that an oscillatory , exponentially decaying solution is recovered as @xmath242 .",
    "values for @xmath217 , @xmath218 , @xmath241 and @xmath3 in 3-@xmath5 for @xmath15 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 are shown in table iii ( for @xmath15 , the effective @xmath243 has been used ) .",
    "the functions @xmath25 and @xmath4 are displayed in figure 2 for @xmath15 and 20 in 3-@xmath5 .",
    "again @xmath96 has been set to @xmath142 without loss of generality .",
    "the most important result to be extracted for table iii is that the value of @xmath3 decreases as @xmath6 increases .",
    "this behaviour is quite different from model a , where @xmath3 increases asymptotically to @xmath147 as @xmath6 increases .",
    "it seems from table iii that @xmath3 probably tends to zero for @xmath41 , although an analytical determination of the correction to scaling for @xmath6 large but finite , analogous to the treatment of the leading scaling function in @xcite , has not yet been realized .",
    "comparison of the scaling and correction - to - scaling functions displayed in figure 2 reinforces a point made in connection with the nonconserved systems , namely that the correction to scaling become large ( relative to the scaling function itself ) at large values of the scaling variable @xmath109 .",
    "as noted before , this suggests that in carrying out scaling analyses of data , more attention should be paid to small and intermediate values of @xmath109 , where corrections to scaling can be expected to be ( relatively ) smaller , than to large @xmath109 .",
    "indeed , for the nonconserved case ( figure 1 ) the correction to scaling has its maximum at a point where the scaling function is already quite small ( around 0.1 ) .",
    "corrections to scaling associated with a non - scaling initial condition have been studied in @xmath0 models within the gaussian closure scheme of mazenko .",
    "we have calculated both the correction - to - scaling function , @xmath4 , and the associated correction - to - scaling exponent , @xmath3 , for both nonconserved and conserved fields . in both cases",
    "mazenko theory suggests that @xmath3 is nontrivial , depending on the nature of the dynamics involved , the dimensionality , @xmath5 , of the system and the number of order parameter components , @xmath6 . for nonconserved fields the value of @xmath3 tends to the limiting value @xmath147 for @xmath41 with",
    "@xmath5 fixed , and for @xmath244 with @xmath6 fixed . in the latter limit , the mazenko theory reduces @xcite to the ojk theory @xcite and its generalizations @xcite , believed to become exact as @xmath244 @xcite .",
    "the 1-@xmath5 xy model is anomalous in that it exhibits a different growth law from the standard one for nonconserved dynamics , and the correction - to - scaling exponent is simple ( @xmath183 ) . in this",
    "model quantities of interest , such as the correlation function @xmath90 , retain ` memory ' of the initial conditions even in the scaling limit .    in studying the conserved @xmath0 model , an expansion in @xmath84",
    "was used which is valid for large @xmath6 .",
    "this approach was used to find the correction - to - scaling function @xmath4 and the exponent @xmath3 for @xmath245 , 20 and 50 in 3-@xmath5 . for @xmath155 ,",
    "an expansion in @xmath198 up to @xmath199 was made . in the latter case",
    ", a comparison @xcite between leading - order scaling results and simulations shows very good agreement despite the wrong growth law ( i.e without the logarithmic corrections predicted for @xmath155 @xcite ) . in conserved systems @xmath3 decreases as @xmath6 increases , raising the question of whether @xmath246 or approaches some limiting value as @xmath6 becomes very large .",
    "we have as yet been unable to find @xmath4 and @xmath3 analytically in the limit of large but finite @xmath6  this remains an interesting open question .",
    "the main lesson for the analysis of experimental and simulation data is that corrections to scaling can be expected to be relatively small at small and intermediate scaling variable @xmath109 ( = @xmath247 ) , suggesting that this region be given more weight than large @xmath109 in fitting ( or collapsing ) data .",
