    "the intermetallic y@xmath0co@xmath1 has attracted much attention since the coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity were discovered in this compound and it is the first itinerant band magnetic superconductor and reported to be weakly ferromagnetic @xcite .",
    "y@xmath0co@xmath1 has an unusual interplay of magnetism and superconductivity .",
    "the compound y@xmath0co@xmath1 is very interesting because neither co nor y as metals are superconductors .",
    "magnetism ( t@xmath4k ) precedes superconductivity ( t@xmath5k ) and the inverse of the behavior has shown most often elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting that in the y - co system the magnetic moment per co atom tends to zero for yco@xmath6 , which is a pauli paramagnet , and the compositions close to y@xmath0co@xmath1 shows a very small magnetic moment about @xmath7 per co atom which is localized on a specific cobalt site @xcite .",
    "there is experimental evidence from nmr that @xmath8-type cobalts enclosed in triangular prisms of y atoms are responsible for the magnetic properties@xcite .",
    "and the small co - co distance prevents magnetism in phases neighbouring to y@xmath0co@xmath1 , a rather different structure of y@xmath9co@xmath10(y@xmath11co@xmath12 ) phase , with the isolated co atoms along the c - axis , is responsible for the magnetic properties and strong development of magnetic correlations @xcite .",
    "the specific heat experiments showed that the phonon contribution is mainly due to y lattice but the electronic contribution is due to the co density of electron states @xcite .",
    "some important features of this type magnetic superconductor remain to be explained theoretically and the preliminary electronic structure study of y@xmath0co@xmath1 is essential to understand the fascinating properties of this compound . in table",
    "[ tableweak ] we summarized the physical characteristics of y@xmath0co@xmath1 and other weak ferromagnets . from the data we can see that y@xmath0co@xmath1 has indeed weak itinerant ferromagnetic properties .",
    "until now there is no detailed electronic band structure studies for y@xmath0co@xmath1 , therefore as a first step the electronic structure investigaion based on the density functional theory is important to understand the nature of this peculiar compound . in this work , the precise self - consistent full potential local orbital minimum basis band structure scheme ( fplo )",
    "are employed to investigate thoroughly the electronic and magnetic properties of y@xmath0co@xmath1 based on the density functional theory .",

    "an unusual feature of this crystal structure is the existence of three inequivalent crystallographic positions of cobalt .",
    "y@xmath0co@xmath1 can be viewed as quasi - infinite triangular columns of trigonal y prisms running along a @xmath15 axis which are made up of two types of y atom(y(1 ) , y(2 ) ) , both at site @xmath16(the site symmetry is m ) , and are centered by two types of co atom at site @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( the site symmetry is m and @xmath15 respectively ) . in co@xmath1ho@xmath0 structure a third atom site is located on the @xmath18-axis , i.e. , in the channels formed by six groups of triangular ho prism columns(at the site @xmath19 , site symmetry @xmath20 ) .",

    "we have applied the full - potential nonorthogonal local - orbital minimum - basis ( fplo ) scheme within the local density approximation ( lda).@xcite in these scalar relativistic calculations we used the exchange and correlation potential of perdew and wang.@xcite y @xmath23 , and co @xmath24 states were included as valence states .",
    "all lower states were treated as core states .",
    "we included the relatively extended semicore 3s , 3p states of co and 3s , 3p , 3d states of y as band states because of the considerable overlap of these states on nearest neighbors .",
    "this overlap would be otherwise neglected in our fplo scheme .",
    "the spatial extension of the basis orbitals , controlled by a confining potential @xmath25 , was optimized to minimize the total energy .",
    "the self - consistent potentials were carried out on a k mesh of 16 k points in each direction of the brillouin zone , which corresponds to 132 k points in the irreducible zone .",
    "the electronic and magnetic studies of y@xmath0co@xmath1 based on density functional theory help to characterize this interesting compound .",
    "the fermi energy lies in a band of @xmath8 electrons of the y atoms and more suppressed by moments on those sites than by the magnetic character of some of the co atoms . the y 3@xmath8 bands are almost filled and this leads to both a small moment and small spin splitting .    around the fermi energy y 4d and co 3d states",
    "are mixed , so the magnetism and superconductivity are strongly linked due to the hybrized y - co bands .",
    "the most intriguing observation in the band structure is the 0.15 ev energy gap along @xmath26 symmetry line which is between the bands of y 4d states .",
    "also there is very flat band located 0.43 ev above fermi level along these lines which are the co 3d character .",
    "there is a flat band along @xmath27 line at 0.1 ev above fermi level which is the y 4d character . density of states ( dos ) is shown in fig .",

    "the corresponding fermi surfaces ( fs ) of y@xmath0co@xmath1 is shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath42 point is located at the center of the hexagonal prism and the @xmath43 point is the midpoint of the lower and upper hexagon .",
    "both the 4@xmath8 electrons of y and the 3@xmath8 electrons of co contribute to the fermi surface . due to the band gap along the symmetry lines",
    "@xmath44 , there is no fs at the center of the hexagonal prism .",
    "the crossing bands near the symmetry line a make some complicated fermi surfaces . in the bottom panel , we can observe the cylindrical tube - like fermi surfaces .",
    "the non - magnetic component determines the position of the fermi level at the bottom or top edge of the @xmath8 band .",
    "the fact that @xmath45 for y@xmath0co@xmath1 is so close to the corresponding value for y shows that it is the @xmath46 electrons of y which are transferred mainly to @xmath2 orbitals of co , and thus filling them while leaving the @xmath3 electrons of y almost inact .",
    "therefore the fermi surface should be composed mainly of @xmath2 electrons of co and @xmath3 electrons of y.",
    "the weak ferromagnetic compounds exhibit the following typical physical properties ; ( 1 ) a low saturation moment per transition metal(tm ) atom at 0k ( @xmath47/tm atom ) . ( 2 ) a low magnetic order - disorder phase transition temperature ( @xmath48 45k ) . ( 3 ) a large high - field magnetic susceptibility at 0k . ( 4 ) a large coefficient of the term linear in temperature in the specific heat at low temperature . ( 5 ) @xmath49 power law behavior of the resistivity over a wide temperature range around @xmath50 .",
    "( 6 ) curie - weiss behavior of the magnetic susceptibility in the paramagnetic state@xcite . from the experimental reports",
    "we can conclude that y@xmath0co@xmath1 joins the weak ferromagnets group such as zrzn@xmath6 , sc@xmath1 in , and ni@xmath1al . according to the the band magnetism , to get a ferromagnet with small magnetic moment in a narrow 3d band",
    "it must be either almost filled or almost empty .",
    "the examples of the former is ni@xmath1al , y@xmath0co@xmath1 and the examples of the latter is zrzn@xmath6 , sc@xmath1 in . a charge transfer from a non magnetic to a magnetic element with a partly filled @xmath8 shell",
    "should take place , because the stable phases are antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic with relatively large moments per site when the shell is almost half filled .",
    "such an observation could explain why weak ferromagnetism occurs mainly in intermetallic compounds , such as zrzn@xmath6,sc@xmath1 in and ni@xmath1al .",
    "kolodziejczyk _ et al._@xcite measured the resistivity of y@xmath0co@xmath1 , in which the resistivity @xmath51 of y@xmath0co@xmath1 follows that @xmath52 in the lower temperature ( 5 - 17k)and @xmath53 in the higher temperature(20 - 70 k ) .",
    "this results agrees very well with the theory of ueda and moriya@xcite",
    ". we can expect the t@xmath31 law to persist also well below t@xmath54 , but such a behavior of the resistivity is suppressed by superconductivity .",
    "we would expect that the band undergoing spin fluctuation should be the hybrised @xmath55 band .",
    "this is because the distance between neighboring co atoms belonging to different positions are large while the y - co distances are small .",
    "the distance y(1)-y(2 ) is approximately 3.32 @xmath56 and the distance between atoms in the cluster forming a prism is co(d)-co(h)=2.34@xmath56 , which is smaller than the distance co - co along the a axis in hexagonal close pack structure of co. the other cluster would be composed of co atoms which occupy only some of the available positions and thus can form pairs or short chains along the c axis .",
    "the clusters of four co atoms in the prism form molecular orbitals which mix with the y @xmath3 and @xmath46 states .",
    "the low spin state could be the lowest energy state for this molecule .",
    "additional reduction of the moment comes from the charge transfer from y to co , therefore the @xmath2 band is almost filled and this leads to both a small magnetic moment and small spin splitting ."
