    "note that this dark matter halo mass estimation method differs from others which assume linear bias and spherical collapse models @xcite which we suggest are not applicable to @xmath1 filamentary structures .",
    "some works @xcite suggest that significant over - densities in dsfgs do not trace massive proto - clusters .",
    "they argue that such significant over - densities are due to `` merger bias '' whereby the submillimeter - luminous phase is too short - lived and rare to be a useful probe of the most massive halos at high-@xmath27 .",
    "indeed , there are several massive proto - clusters at @xmath8 that contain no dsfgs , and some structures of only moderate mass which appear to contain a few dsfgs @xcite .",
    "the @xcite work argues that dsfg over - densities are _ poor _ tracers of the most massive over - densities at high - redshift because poisson noise dominates for low numbers of dsfgs .",
    "while this is likely the case for 13 dsfgs , our results ( and our interpretation of their figure 3 ) imply that the opposite is actually true for sufficiently large numbers of dsfgs per proto - cluster .",
    "instead we suggest that spectroscopic incompleteness in both lbg and submillimeter samples around high-@xmath27 proto - clusters has potentially hindered the discovery of more starburst - enriched and agn - enriched proto - clusters .",
    "if this is the case , aggressive spectroscopic follow - up of dsfgs might substantially help the effort to identify high-@xmath27 proto - cluster environments , where the spectroscopic investment needed for lbg samples is prohibitive on large scales ( i.e. identification of @xmath4340 spectroscopically - identified lbgs , with a resulting @xmath44 ) . with the identification of four 2030 arcminute - scale over - densities containing @xmath456 dsfgs ( hdf , pcl1002  and ssa22 ) in only a few degrees of deep submillimeter surveys , the potential to identify further massive cluster progenitors via their member dsfgs and agn is quite promising .",
    "the over - abundance of what are thought to be short - duration , @xmath4100myr , phenomena ( both dsfgs and luminous agn ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in an extended proto - cluster structure is conspicuously rare . even scaling density estimates proportional to the lbg overenhancement ,",
    "the dsfg / agn presence is excessive .",
    "the extra dsfg / agn can be explained with only two possible physical interpretations : either the dsfgs and agn are short - lived and triggered _ simultaneously _ via a process related to the over - dense environment or the dsfgs and agn must be much longer lived than expected by existing observations of similar phenomena in the field .",
    "the evidence we present here is suggestive of the former , that dsfgs and agn are short - lived , and in that case , their triggering must be environmentally driven .",
    "this is supported by the increased interaction fraction seen in proto - cluster members optical morphologies , larger ism masses in proto - cluster members ( albeit a marginal distinction requiring confirmation ) , and the lack of physical motivation for long qso lifetimes @xcite beyond the increased gas - feeding argument often argued for dsfgs .",
    "if correct , these observations provide the first concrete evidence that environmental triggering can occur over extraordinarily large volumes ( 15000mpc@xmath3 comoving ) at @xmath8 .",
    "it should be noted that the structure s member lbgs do not appear to have sufficiently different observational characteristics than lbgs in the field .",
    "comparison against the control sample indicates that proto - cluster lbgs have slightly higher stellar masses ( by a factor of 1.5@xmath110.3 ) and similar star - formation rates .",
    "nevertheless , as a sheer consequence of their number , lbgs dominate the calculation of the structure s net dark matter halo mass which is estimated to be significant at @xmath438@xmath1910@xmath46m@xmath6 .",
    "this is predicted to mature to a few @xmath41m@xmath6at @xmath7 .",
    "cosmological dark - matter simulations suggest that today s most massive clusters occupied volumes several hundred times larger @xcite at @xmath47 , having not yet virialized into the compact structures we see today .",
    "pcl1002  affirms these predictions , as its 15000mpc@xmath3 volume is predicted to collapse to a volume of @xmath4850mpc@xmath3 at @xmath7 , which is consistent with all nearby @xmath49m@xmath6  clusters .",
    "while this confirms the notion of a genuine massive cluster in formation , this volume - scaling also implies that _ most _ clusters will have similarly large sizes at @xmath9 , subtending areas half a degree across on the sky .",
    "observationally isolating massive clusters in formation then comes down to accurate redshift identification to within @xmath50 , because other observational characteristics are not sufficiently environmentally distinct at these epochs .",
    "identifying and correctly classifying pcl1002  as a massive galaxy cluster progenitor would not have been possible without the concentrated presence of cosmologically rare phenomena like dusty starbursts and luminous agn .",
    "future large and deep @xmath51100deg@xmath18 submillimeter surveys could play a crucial part in statistically characterizing the population of such large structures during their formation epoch , as groups of dsfgs and luminous agn can act as signposts to the largest mass concentrations .",
    "equally important is complete spectroscopic follow - up at @xmath8 over those wide - areas , like large optical campaigns similar to hetdex @xcite and potential future large millimeter line searches targeting co or [ cii ] with a wide - bandwidth spectrometer . the discovery of more high-@xmath27 , starbursting over - densities will be inevitable , but it will be the constraints on their volume density and assembly timescale that will have significant repercussions on cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and the formation mechanisms of the coma - like superclusters we see today .",
