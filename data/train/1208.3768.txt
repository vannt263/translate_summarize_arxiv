    "<S> the hydrogen atom under the pressure of a spherical penetrable confinement potential of a decreasing radius @xmath0 is explored , as a case study . </S>",
    "<S> a novel counter - intuitive effect of atomic swelling rather than shrinking with decreasing @xmath0 is unraveled , when @xmath0 reaches , and remains smaller than , a certain critical value . upon swelling , </S>",
    "<S> the size of the atom is shown to increase by an order of magnitude , or more , compared to the size of the free atom . </S>",
    "<S> examples of changes of photoabsorption properties of confined hydrogen atom upon its swelling are uncovered and demonstrated .    </S>",
    "<S> modifications in the structure and spectra of atoms confined in cages whose sizes are commensurable with atomic sizes has been probed by researchers since the early works of michels _ et al _ @xcite and sommerfeld and welker @xcite devoted to hydrogen centrally confined in an impenetrable square - well of adjustable radius , to simulate pressure . </S>",
    "<S> to date , numerous aspects of the structure and spectra of atoms under various kinds of confinements have been attacked from many different angles by research teams world - wide . </S>",
    "<S> this has resulted in a huge array of unraveled effects and data being accumulated in a large number of publications , see reviews @xcite as well as numerous review papers in @xcite ( and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> there , one finds a wealth of information on properties of single - electron , two - electron and many - electron atoms confined by impenetrable spherical , spheroidal as well as open boundaries potentials ( e.g. , see review papers in @xcite by aquino , p.@xmath1 ; laughlin , p.@xmath2 ; cruz , p.@xmath3 ; garza and vargas , p.@xmath4 ) , oscillator potentials ( e.g. , patil and varshni @xcite , p.1 ) , potentials limited by conoidal boundaries ( ley - koo e @xcite , p.79 ) , debye potentials ( sil , canuto and mukherjee @xcite ) , fullerene - cage potentials ( dolmatov @xcite , p.13 ; charkin _ et al _ @xcite , p.69 ) , _ etc_. all these activities speak to the importance of the subject . </S>",
    "<S> this is because confined atoms behave differently from free atoms in ways which provide insight into various interesting problems of interdisciplinary importance . to list a few , the latter </S>",
    "<S> could be associated with atoms trapped in hollow cavities of solids , zeolites , fullerenes , helium droplets formed in walls of nuclear reactors , atoms / ions placed in a plasma environment , _ </S>",
    "<S> etc_. furthermore , by suitably tailoring the confinement parameters , novel specific atomic properties can be designed in a controllable manner , thereby opening up new technological possibilities for confined atoms .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this paper is to demonstrate that upon compression of an atom by a suitably tailored repulsive confining spherical potential @xmath5 of a finite height and thickness , the atom can be transformed into novel exotic sort of an atom of a large size and distinct spectra . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that upon decreasing the radius of the confining potential ( thereby increasing the pressure on a confined atom ) below to a certain critical value @xmath6 , the atom stops behaving in the conventional manner . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the atom suddenly swells rather than keeps shrinking in size . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is termed _ </S>",
    "<S> atomic swelling_. it is the ultimate aim of this paper to demonstrate and interpret atomic swelling , as well as to explore trends which might occur in photoabsorption spectra of confined atoms upon atomic swelling . </S>",
    "<S> the hydrogen atom is chosen as a touchstone for such a study . </S>",
    "<S> atomic units ( a.u . ) are used throughout the paper unless otherwise specified .    for confined hydrogen , radial wavefunctions @xmath7 and energies @xmath8 of discrete states @xmath9 or continuum spectrum @xmath10 , in the presence of a spherical confinement modeled by a confining potential @xmath5 , are determined by a radial schrdinger equation @xmath11p_{n(\\epsilon)\\ell}(r ) \\nonumber \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> \\fl = e_{n(\\epsilon ) \\ell } p_{n(\\epsilon)\\ell}(r ) . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{eqh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as a first guiding step in understanding which aspects of a confined / compressed hydrogen atom ( labelled h@@xmath12 ) are most unusual , @xmath5 is approximated by a square - well potential of certain adjustable inner radius @xmath0 , height @xmath13 and thickness @xmath14 , as in @xcite : @xmath15 however , the square - well with infinitely sharp boundaries might be thought to induce some artefacts in the structure and spectra of h@@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a trial study where the square - well potential is replaced by a potential with diffuse boundaries [ to be labelled as @xmath16 is conducted in this paper as well . for this , @xmath17 is represented by the sum of two repulsive woods - saxon potentials : @xmath18 here , @xmath19 is the diffuseness parameter , and @xmath0 , @xmath20 and @xmath14 are the same as the parameters of the square - well potential ( [ swp ] ) . in this paper , the @xmath20 , @xmath14 and @xmath19 parameter values </S>",
    "<S> are arbitrary chosen to be @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , just as a case study .    </S>",
    "<S> one of key results of the study - atomic swelling upon compression - is demonstrated by figure @xmath24 for the @xmath25 ground - state of hydrogen under compression .    </S>",
    "<S> first , one can see that the @xmath26 wavefunction of h@@xmath12 gets contracted into the inner region of space as @xmath0 is decreased from @xmath27 ( free hydrogen ) to @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy @xmath29 , in turn , increased ( less binding ) from @xmath30 ev for free hydrogen to @xmath31 ev for h@@xmath12 at @xmath32 . thus far , both @xmath26 and @xmath29 behave in the conventional manner . </S>",
    "<S> however , at just a bit smaller @xmath0 , specifically , at @xmath33 versus @xmath34 , the @xmath25 orbital suddenly expands into an outer region in space , gets quite diffuse and peaks at @xmath35 or @xmath36 , depending on whether the atom is confined by the square - well or diffuse potential , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the implication is that under the increased pressure , when @xmath0 reaches the value of @xmath37 , the atom suddenly swells strongly , rather than getting shrunk , in size - the effect referred to as _ atomic swelling _ in this paper . at this @xmath37 , </S>",
    "<S> the atomic size becomes more than by the order of magnitude bigger that the size of the free atom , due to spectacular atomic swelling . </S>",
    "<S> a trial calculation showed that further decrease of @xmath0 hardly affects @xmath26 and @xmath29 ; both of them remain practically unchanged at @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because , at @xmath38 , about all of the @xmath25 electron density has concentrated outside of the confining potential . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , decreasing @xmath0 below @xmath39 can not exert any more pressure on the atom . </S>",
    "<S> hence , both @xmath26 and @xmath29 stop changing any significantly for all @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> next , the @xmath26 functions , calculated with the use of either the square - well or diffuse confining potential , are almost the same at @xmath37 , as is clearly seen in figure @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that , first , atomic swelling is not an artifact caused by the infinitely sharp boundaries of the square - well potential and , second , atomic swelling is somewhat insensitive to the shape of a penetrable confining potential . for this reason , </S>",
    "<S> all other calculated data presented in this paper were obtained with the use of the square - well potential , for the sake of simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , this effect of atomic swelling is opposite to another counter - intuitive effect of _ orbital compression _ by _ attractive confinement _ which was revealed earlier in work @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , note , the attempt to calculate @xmath26 and @xmath29 between @xmath40 failed , for a reason which is explained later in the paper .    </S>",
    "<S> the physics behind the effect discovered , atomic swelling of hydrogen under compression , becomes clear when one explores figure @xmath41 , where the effective potential @xmath42 ` seen ' by the @xmath25 electron in the h@@xmath12 atom is depicted .    </S>",
    "<S> one can see that adding the confining potential to the atomic potential makes @xmath43 to consists of two wells , a short - range inner well and shallow long - range outer well . </S>",
    "<S> as long as the the confining radius @xmath0 is such that the inner short - range is more binding than the outer well , the @xmath25 electrons remains in the inner well . </S>",
    "<S> there , the atom behaves ` normally ' , i.e. , its size is shrinking and the @xmath29 energy rising with decreasing @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the confinement radius @xmath0 and , hence , the width of the inner short - range well becomes the same or smaller than some critical value , @xmath44 , the inner well becomes less binding , and so the binding of the electron is altered in favour of the long - range outer well . as a result , atomic swelling into the outer well is induced by gradually reducing the confinement radius @xmath0 to @xmath45 . in the chosen case study , </S>",
    "<S> atomic swelling occurred at @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> note , the double - well potential naturally occurs in d- and f - series of free atoms , resulting in the effect know as orbital collapse ( a thorough review of the topic was given by connerade @xcite , chapter @xmath46 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the difference here is that orbital collapse is due to the cetrifugal term in the effective atomic potential , and , hence , affects only states with @xmath47 , in contrast to the present study . </S>",
    "<S> it also results in orbital shrinking rather than swelling . </S>",
    "<S> both situations , however , are clearly similar in the spirit . furthermore , even closer in the spirit , but opposite in the intention and outcome , was the study performed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there , atoms with an electron being originally bound by an outer long - range well of the _ natural _ atomic double - well potential [ e.g. , an excited @xmath48 electron in cr(@xmath49 , @xmath50 ) ] , were placed inside a spherical potential of decreasing radius @xmath0 , with finite or infinite potential height @xmath20 , but infinite thickness @xmath51 . that resulted in turning the outer long - range well into a short - range well which , thus , became less binding , or otherwise destroyed at all , at small @xmath0 , for an obvious reason . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the competition between the inner and outer wells was altered in favour of the former , leading to @xmath48 orbital collapse into the inner well . in the present study , on the contrary , due to _ finite _ @xmath14 , </S>",
    "<S> the double - well potential is artificially _ created _ rather than getting destroyed as in @xcite , and not the outer well but the _ inner _ well is shortened upon decreasing @xmath0 , so that the competition takes the opposite direction resulting in orbital swelling rather than collapse .    </S>",
    "<S> now , what about the range of @xmath40 , where the calculation of @xmath26 and @xmath29 failed in the present study ? </S>",
    "<S> the interpretation is that , for @xmath40 , both the short - range inner and long - range outer wells have about the same binding strength for the @xmath25 electron . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , @xmath26 should possess two maxima of not too dissimilar amplitudes , one in each of the well . </S>",
    "<S> earlier such rare occurrence was found to emerge naturally in @xmath52 series of ba@xmath53 @xcite and in compressed cr @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it becomes very difficult to obtain the solution of the shrdinger or hartree - fock equation in this parameter range , where a standard computer algorithm becomes unstable ; see discussion of this topic in chapter @xmath46 of @xcite , or a brief discussion and references in @xcite .    not only can the @xmath25 ground state of confined hydrogen experience atomic swelling , but excited states as well . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly demonstrated by figures @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where the @xmath56 and @xmath57 radial functions of hydrogen compressed by the square - well potential with @xmath58 ( figure @xmath54 ) and @xmath28 ( figure @xmath55 ) are depicted .    </S>",
    "<S> let us discuss the displayed calculated data for @xmath37 and @xmath28 separately , along with their significance for the photoabsorption spectra of the compressed atom .    exploring figure  @xmath54 ( @xmath37 ) , one can see , first , that the excited @xmath56 orbital peaks at @xmath59 versus @xmath60 for free hydrogen . thus , the size of the h(@xmath61)@@xmath12 atom is three times of the size of the excited free atom - a clear evidence of atomic swelling of excited states under the confinement . </S>",
    "<S> second , highly spectacular , the excited @xmath56 and ground - state @xmath62 functions of h@@xmath12 appear to be about the same and pick at about the same value of @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the overlap between @xmath56 and @xmath62 is thus huge , compared to that of the free atom . </S>",
    "<S> this implies an anomaly large oscillator strength @xmath64 of the @xmath65 transition in h@@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the calculation shows that @xmath66 in h@@xmath12 compared to only @xmath67 in free hydrogen . as known , the sum of all oscillator strengths of @xmath68 transitions from an atomic @xmath9 subshell into its discrete and continuum spectra equals the number of electrons in the subshell . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in our case , over @xmath69 of the total oscillator strength of h@@xmath12 belongs to a single transition @xmath65 - a bizarre property of the atom under penetrable confinement . </S>",
    "<S> note , earlier @xcite , the anomaly large value of @xmath70 of hydrogen was predicted upon its confinement inside of an impenetrable well ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) of a small radius @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> that result , however , is not surprising , since the impenetrable confinement _ does _ actually compress the atom by driving the @xmath61 orbital closer to the @xmath25 one .    </S>",
    "<S> looking at figure  @xmath55 ( @xmath28 ) , one meets another set of unusual results . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , one can see that , due to atomic swelling , the excited @xmath56 and @xmath57 orbitals of h@@xmath12 are , first , pushed far away from the origin , whereas the ground - state function @xmath62 peaks compactly near @xmath73 , as in the free atom ( @xmath25 atomic swelling does not occur at @xmath28 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , second , mostly important , both @xmath74 and @xmath75 everywhere where @xmath76 in h@@xmath12 , in contrast to the behaviour of @xmath62 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the free atom . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the overlap between @xmath62 and @xmath77 functions is practically zero , so that @xmath78 , in the compressed atom . </S>",
    "<S> this implies , that the compressed atom has lost its @xmath79 discrete photoabsorption spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the only possibility for the h(@xmath25)@@xmath80 atom to absorb a photon is exclusively through its photoionization . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the spectra of the free hydrogen , hydrogen under confinement with @xmath28 and hydrogen under confinement with @xmath37 are distinctly different from each other , both qualitatively and quantitatively .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the discussion in the present paper has dealt with the atomic structure and photo - spectra of hydrogen under compression by a repulsive penetrable spherical potential @xmath5 of a certain height @xmath20 , thickness @xmath14 and inner radius @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the tendency of sudden atomic swelling rather than contraction upon increasing pressure has been discovered . </S>",
    "<S> profoundly distinct impacts of atomic swelling on the photo - spectra of hydrogen under confinement have been demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , it has been unraveled that atomic swelling can result either in the loss of a discrete photoabsorption spectrum of the atom , or , on the contrary , in its significant gain , depending on pressure ( i.e. , the confinement radius @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the findings have been exemplified using of arbitrarily chosen values of @xmath20 and @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> however , some critical values of @xmath20 and @xmath14 below which the effects will vanish are anticipated . </S>",
    "<S> this will happen when @xmath20 and @xmath14 are such that the confining potential fails to push atomic levels up to the degree needed for the electron to jump from a narrow inner binding well of the effective potential @xmath43 into its outer binding well ( see figure @xmath41 ) , at any @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> other than that , the effects discovered must persist for a broad range of @xmath20 and @xmath14 values . as a follow - up study </S>",
    "<S> , it would be interesting to learn how atomic swelling develops in a multielectron atom , where not just one electron but two or more might jump from the inner well into the outer well of @xmath81 at a certain critical value of @xmath0 , how the effect could affect electron correlation in the atom , as well as how all this could modify the interaction of radiation with such a compressed multielectron atom relative to the free atom . the authors are currently working on these topics . as for the present paper , its sole aim has been to demonstrate the existence and importance of atomic swelling itself , as the first step towards the understanding of what might happen in atoms confined by repulsive spherical potentials of finite thickness .    </S>",
