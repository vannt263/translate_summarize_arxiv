    "due to its unique chemistry , chlorine plays an important role in characterizing the neutral gas components ( jura 1974 ; dalgarno et al .",
    "1974 ) in the interstellar medium ( ism ) . in diffuse clouds ,",
    "the detection of chlorine in its various ionization states allows us to disentangle the diffuse molecular gas components from the neutral atomic gas components ( jura & york 1978 ) along sight lines exhibiting complex structures that are often unresolved with the current instrumentation ( e.g. , rachford et al .",
    "most importantly , offers an alternate and more reliable way of tracing cold h@xmath0 gas components in diffuse clouds since , unlike co , the chlorine abundance remains unaffected by molecular processes such as chemical fractionation and photodissociation ( sonnentrucker et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "exhibits transitions solely below 1080  , all with laboratory - determined @xmath2-values ( schectman et al .",
    "1993 , 2005 ) .",
    ", on the other hand , is predicted to have over 50 transitions between @xmath3920 and @xmath31390    ( morton 2003 and references therein ) . to date , only three lines , @xmath3@xmath31088 , 1097 and 1347  , possess experimentally - determined @xmath2-values . because of its strength the 1347   line is almost always optically thick and its use requires careful treatment of saturation effects ( jura & york 1978 ; jenkins et al . 1986 ; harris & bromage 1984 ) .",
    "the @xmath31088   line often suffers from severe blending with an adjacent co band ( federman 1986 ) while the @xmath31097   line , due to its intrinsic weakness , requires significant reddening and high s / n ratio to be detectable along a given sight line .",
    "consequently , accurate determination of the column density and the chlorine cosmic abundance remained difficult with prior space - based missions such as _ copernicus _ and _ iue _ ( keenan & dufton 1990 ) .",
    "the _ fuse _ wavelength range and especially its greater sensitivity  compared to previous missions allowed us to revisit the role that chlorine can play in increasing our understanding of the structure in the diffuse atomic and diffuse molecular ism . since",
    "a reliable atomic database is necessary for such an endeavor , we proposed to empirically determine the oscillator strength ( @xmath2-value ) for 4 lines particularly well suited for our study .",
    "the 1004 , 1079 , 1090 , 1094   lines are predicted to be weak , are often detected toward low - to - moderately reddened stars and do not significantly suffer from blends with other species .",
    "we present the results of our @xmath2-value investigation for these 4 lines toward the moderately reddened stars , hd91597 , hd220057 and hd108 and three additional stars from the _ fuse _ archive .",
    "section 2 summarizes our observations and data reduction technique .",
    "section 3 describes our analysis , compares our empirical @xmath2-value estimates to the theoretical calculations listed in morton ( 2003 ) , and discusses the value of as a tracer of h@xmath0 .",
    "three stars were successfully observed for our program ( d064 ) , hd91597 , hd220057 and hd108 .",
    "their selection was based on the following criteria .",
    "1 ) existence of archival stis data covering the 1347   range ; 2 ) simple velocity structure to ensure proper correction for saturation , when present and ; 3 ) small or negligible amounts of co to minimize blending with the 1088   line .",
    "the _ fuse _ data were processed with version 3.0.8 of the calfuse pipeline . for each sight line ,",
    "the individual spectra were co - added by cross - correlation with respect to the brightest exposure , in each segment .",
    "the fp - split technique was used while acquiring observations toward hd91597 and hd220057 in order to reach s / n ratios @xmath4 30 per resolution element , ratios calculated to obtain detection of the weak 1097   at a 3@xmath5 level . while this level of detection was achieved toward hd108 , the data collected toward hd91597 and hd220057 only allowed for a detection of the 1097   line at a 1.8@xmath5 and 2.6@xmath5 level , respectively ( table 1 ) . for all targets presented here , the s / n ratio ranges from 15 to 41 .",
    "figure  1 displays the co - added spectra obtained with the lif1a and lif2a segments , respectively .",
    "the calibrated _ hst _ data were retrieved from the mast archive .",
    "all stars were observed with the stis instrument , using the 0.1@xmath6 @xmath7 0.03@xmath6 or 0.2@xmath6 @xmath7 0.2@xmath6 apertures and the e140h grating ( p8484 : jenkins ; p9434-p8241 : lauroesch ) .",
    "no additional reductions were performed on these datasets .",
    "in order to determine whether corrections need to be applied to the theoretical @xmath2-values listed in morton ( 2003 ) for the 1004 , 1079 , 1090 and 1094   transitions , one must first determine the total column density toward each sight line .",
    "since both lines at 1347 and 1097   have experimentally - determined @xmath2-values and because @xmath2(1347)/@xmath2(1097)@xmath117.4 ( schectman et al . 1993 ) , these two lines uniquely constrain both the linear and the flat part of the curve of growth for a given sight line , for the column densities observed here .",
    "we , subsequently , designed our observing strategy in order to obtain equivalent widths for both lines and we derived the corresponding column density using a one - component curve of growth .",
    "we then measured the equivalent width of the 4 lines under study and determined the best - fit @xmath2-values to the previously - constrained curves of growth with a least - squares technique .",
    "as can be seen in figs .  1 and 2 , the 1090 and 1079   lines are intrinsically weak and are thereby only detected toward the most reddened stars in our sample .",
    "in order to both better constrain the oscillator strength of these 2 lines and to test the robustness of our revised @xmath2-values for the stronger lines ( @xmath3@xmath31004 and 1094  ) , we measured the equivalent widths of all 6 transitions toward three additional sight lines .",
    "the choice of these stars was driven by their reddening , similar to that of hd108 , the existence of both archival _ fuse _ and stis data and the extensive knowledge regarding their respective sight line physical conditions ( rachford et al .",
    "2002 ; sonnentrucker et al . 2003 ; pan et al . 2005 ) , of importance to consider saturation effects .",
    "table  1 lists our equivalent width measurements for all the lines toward the program stars selected for this study ( upper half ) and toward the 3 additional moderately - reddened sight lines extracted from the _ fuse _ and stis archives ( lower half ) .",
    "when measurements are available in two segments , we report the equivalent width weighted mean calculated by weighting each measurement by its corresponding error .",
    "all errors include fixed - pattern noise and continuum placement uncertainties and represent 1@xmath5 formal errors alone .",
    "figure 2 displays the 1097   line ( right panels ) and the 1079   line ( left panels ) in the heliocentric velocity frame .",
    "figure  3 ( upper panels ) shows the one - component curve of growth ( cog ) obtained from the 1097 and 1347    measurements ( black symbols ) toward our program stars hd91597 ,",
    "hd220057 and hd108 .",
    "the red symbols show the best fit of the @xmath3@xmath31004 , 1079 , 1090 and 1094   line equivalent widths to each cog using our revised @xmath2-values .",
    "the lower panels display the measurements and respective cogs for the archival stars used to test our results .",
    "as can be readily seen from table  2 , our target selection covers a wide enough range in column density that each line is on the plotted linear part of the cog toward at least 2 sight lines and suffers various degrees of saturation toward the rest of the sample , thus ensuring that our revisions to the theoretical @xmath2-values are not significantly affected by saturation .",
    "other potential sources of error when revising the @xmath2-values empirically arise from blends between chlorine and other ism species or blends with instrumental artifacts such as fixed - pattern noise or local sensitivity deficiencies . we determined that none of the lines investigated here suffered from such artifacts by measuring the equivalent widths in different segments .",
    "the lines at 1004 , 1079 and 1090   are also all free of blends with other interstellar species .",
    "the 1094   is the only line under investigation that could potentially be affected by absorption caused by an intervening h@xmath0 @xmath8 6 line ( @xmath31094.80  ) . to determine to what extent this h@xmath0 line may affect our results , we estimated the h@xmath0 column density using the @xmath9 6 absorption lines arising from all other h@xmath0 ro - vibrational transitions present in the _ fuse _ bandpass . between 4 and 7 additional ,",
    "unblended @xmath9 6 lines were measured .",
    "we determined that the equivalent width of this h@xmath0 line is less than the error in the equivalent width of the 1094   line in all cases .",
    "we are thereby confident that our @xmath2-value estimate of the 1094   line is not significantly affected by h@xmath0 blending in our star sample .",
    "table  3 lists the wavelengths of the 4 lines we investigated and compares the theoretical @xmath2-values listed in morton ( 2003 ; and references therein ) with our proposed recommendations .",
    "the last column indicates whether the chlorine lines were subject to potential blends . within our measurement errors , we find that the ratios of the theoretical @xmath2-values to our empirical @xmath2-values differ by factors @xmath13.1 ( @xmath31004  ) , @xmath11.2 ( @xmath31079  ) , @xmath12.4 ( @xmath31090  ) and @xmath10.42 ( @xmath31094  ) .",
    "our analysis also shows that can sometimes be used to draw additional conclusions regarding the structure of the molecular gas toward a given sight line . because results from rapid ion - molecule reaction between cl@xmath10 and h@xmath0 once molecular hydrogen is optically thick , constitutes a good tracer for molecular gas components in general .",
    "hence , one can use the gas structure to infer the distribution of h@xmath0 wherever it is optically thick and thereby often difficult to measure accurately .",
    "for the star sample presented here our chlorine analysis indicates that @xmath11-values of the order of those listed in table  2 are most appropriate to constrain the h@xmath0 column densities arising from the lowest rotational levels if saturation is observed ( e.g. , sonnentrucker et al .",
    "2003 ) . adopting the column densities from the literature",
    "( see table  2 ) , we estimated the to column density ratios . our results further indicate that , for these stars , the variation in this ratio by almost a factor 15 is mostly due to variations in the column density which , in turn , is mostly tracing the increasing fraction of optically thick molecular hydrogen present along each sight line ( jura & york 1978 ) .",
