    "much excitement has followed the discovery of a connection between a galaxy s central black hole mass and the bulge velocity dispersion ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et  al .",
    "2000 ) @xmath12 . when coupled with the relation between the deprojected circular velocity , @xmath13^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath14 is the total mass within @xmath15 of the center , and the one - dimensional line - of - sight ( projected ) central velocity dispersion , @xmath1 , a relation between supermassive black hole ( sbh ) and total galaxy masses can be established ( ferrarese 2002 [ f02 ] ; baes et  al .",
    "2003 [ b03 ] ; pizzella et  al .",
    "2005 [ p05 ] ) .",
    "such a connection supports the notion of regulated formation mechanisms and co - evolution for the smallest and largest structures in galaxies ( e.g. f02 ; ho 2004 ; ferrarese et  al .",
    "2006 [ f06 ] ) .",
    "previous derivations of the @xmath16 relation for spiral and elliptical galaxies for which dynamical measurements were either measured and/or inferred ( whitmore et  al .",
    "1979 [ wks79 ] ; f02 ; b03 ; p05 ) , have considered a simple relation of the form @xmath17 . for spiral galaxies , @xmath0 is measured at some fiducial radius in their outer parts ; for ellipticals , @xmath0 is inferred via dynamical modeling of the absorption line features and surface brightness profiles .",
    "the dynamical modeling of elliptical systems is , however , intrinsically challenging and the resulting dynamical estimates remain significantly uncertain . for a heterogeneous sample ( described below ) of 40 high surface brightness ( hsb ) spiral and 24 elliptical galaxies ,",
    "p05 reported the one - dimensional correlation :    @xmath18    the realisation that elliptical and spiral galaxies appear to obey the same @xmath16 relation diagnostic of kormendy & illingworth ( 1982 ; also binney & tremaine fig .",
    "4 - 6 ) for elliptical galaxies which uses different velocity measurements ; kormendy & illingworth measure @xmath19 in the bulge ( e.g. at the bulge effective radius ) whereas our @xmath0 is a measurement near the peak of the rotation curve . ]",
    "prompted p05 to suggest that the central velocity dispersion of a galaxy is independent of morphological type for a given dark matter halo . assuming that mass traces light , the opposite is , however , expected on first dynamical principles .",
    "we can write the jeans equation for spherical , or nearly spherical , self - gravitating systems ( e.g. wks79 ; binney & tremaine 1987 , eq .",
    "4 - 55 ; see also dekel et  al .",
    "2005 ) :    @xmath20\\sigma_r^2(r)\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 is the logarithmic derivative of the stellar density profile @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the anisotropy parameter .",
    "we can rewrite as :    @xmath25^{1/2}\\ ] ]    where the index `` in '' refers to quantities measured in the inner parts of the galaxy , by contract with @xmath0 which is measured in the outer parts .",
    "the ratio @xmath26 depends strongly on the shape of the underlying rotation curve , through @xmath27 , which is itself directly related to morphology or concentration ( e.g. kent 1987 ) . and",
    "while a dependence of @xmath21 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 on concentration is also expected on first principles , a full derivation is thwarted by the non - trivial covariances between these terms and the limited data to decompose @xmath7 in terms of the jeans equation parameters .",
    "still , we verify empirically in this _ letter _",
    ", in accord with wks79 but in contrast with p05 , the dependence of the @xmath7 ratio on concentration .",
    "the simultaneous fitting of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and the light profile , @xmath32 , to fully constrain galaxy dynamics has thus far been attempted mostly for dwarf galaxies which are dark matter dominated at nearly all radii and where concerns about stellar populations are lessened ( e.g. dutton et  al .",
    "such dynamical mapping of dwarf galaxies was explored by many as a potential route to solving the so - called `` satellite over - production '' problem in @xmath33cdm structure formation models since the same physics to predict galaxy satellite distributions and internal dynamics is at play ( e.g. moore et  al .  1999 ;",
    "stoehr et  al .  2002 ; kazantzidis et  al .  2004 ; mashchenko , sills , & couchman 2006 ) .",
    "these models involve significant simplifications and solutions are not unique ; a major limitation is the degree of velocity dispersion anisotropy which remains poorly constrained with current observations ; there indeed exists a well - known degeneracy between velocity anisotropy and mass distribution given only rotation and velocity dispersion data ( e.g. gerhard et  al .",
    "1998 ) , as well as significant degeneracy in the @xmath34 values of the host halo that reproduce observed @xmath31 and surface brightness profiles ( bullock 2006 ; priv .",
    "furthermore , dynamical studies of dwarf galaxies have often assumed @xmath35 , the expectation for an isothermal sphere ( binney & tremaine 1987 ; eq .",
    "4 - 127b ) .",
    "we show in this _",
    "letter _ that this assumption is unlikely .",
    "while the mass modeling of dwarf , and more massive , galaxies in the context of @xmath33cdm cosmogony still falls short of providing a clear mapping of @xmath8 with galaxy types , progress can still be achieved by considering specific parameters such as the maximum circular velocity , @xmath0 , the central velocity dispersion , @xmath1 , and their relation across the full range of galaxy types and masses .",
    "below we use existing data bases to demonstrate the dependence of @xmath7 on the galaxy light concentration .",
    "we attempt to bolster this result in  4 using self - consistent dynamical models and conclude with a discussion of the significance of this result for models of galaxy dynamics and formation .",
    "we have compiled data from the literature which includes measurements or modeling of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for spiral , lenticular , and elliptical galaxies .",
    "we have first built upon the compilation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 by p05 from the heterogeneous data bases of f02 and b03 .",

    "( 2006 ; b06 ) also compiled heterogeneous kinematic data for 51 s0 galaxies that we shall use ; the stellar kinematics to estimate @xmath0 were all corrected for asymmetric drift following neistein et  al .",
    "1999 . finally , in order to map the lower range of galaxy masses and brightnesses , we have also considered the dynamical measurements for 8 local group dwarf irregular ( di ) galaxies with @xmath36 kms^-1km@xmath37s@xmath38by mateo ( 1998 ) and woo et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "our heterogeneous sample includes 154 hsb / lsb spiral , 54 lenticular , 24 elliptical , and 11 dwarf irregular galaxies with measured @xmath1 and either measured or inferred @xmath0 .",
    "our compilation , including new concentrations presented below , is available at www.astro.queensu.ca/@xmath39courteau/data/vsigmac28.txt .",
    "based on an overlap of 10 galaxies between f02 and pms01 , we estimate a systematic difference of 24 kms^-1km@xmath37s@xmath38for @xmath0 and 9 kms^-1km@xmath37s@xmath38for @xmath1 over the full range of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . there is no overlap between the southern hemisphere galaxies compiled by b03 and the samples of pms01 , f02 , or b06 .",
    "our sub - samples are all collections of heterogeneous data and it is not clear , due to the small sample sizes , whether any bias exists among the data sets .",
    "we make the assumption that our compiled data for @xmath0 and @xmath1 are uniformly calibrated and can be inter - compared . as supporting evidence",
    "we note that our main conclusions hold whether we analyze the individual samples or the full data collection .",
    "one must also keep in mind that @xmath1 s in spiral galaxies may be polluted by disk stars and thus represent an upper limit .",
    "we also make the assumption that the rotational velocity of the gas , @xmath40 , is an accurate tracer of the circular velocity , i.e. @xmath41 for spirals .",
    "shows the distribution of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for our full sample . a well defined , though broad , @xmath16 relation seems to hold for galaxies with @xmath42 and @xmath43 . for smaller galaxies , rotational and dispersion estimates",
    "are less certain due to relatively more prominent gas turbulence , velocity anisotropy , and measurement errors .",
    "the morphological dependence of the @xmath16 relation for spiral galaxies is obvious . for a given @xmath0 , or total luminosity ,",
    "early - type spirals have a higher @xmath1 than later types ( wks79 ) . for the sample of 21 ellipticals reported in p05 , k00 find that the anisotropy parameter @xmath44 at @xmath45 and most of their galaxies exhibit near - isotropy near the center",
    ". this sample is dominated by e0-e1 ellipticals that scatter about the isothermal @xmath35 line .",
    "the possible dependence of @xmath16 on morphology for elliptical galaxies is discussed below .",
    "note how lsb galaxies delineate the envelope of spiral galaxies in the @xmath16 distribution on account of their relatively small bulges , or low concentrations .",
    "p05 viewed the distributions of lsb and hsb spirals as two distinct @xmath16 relations but fit hsb spiral and elliptical galaxies with a common @xmath16 relation ( eq .",
    "1 ) ; this statement , however , overlooks the expected @xmath16 dependence on galaxy concentration for all galaxy types .",
    "we quantify this relation in  3 .",
    "the comparison of @xmath16 for ellipticals with   disks demands care as the inner disks within flattened ellipticals are embedded in a complex triaxial potential , unlike pure spiral disks which may revolve in a more spherical halo and for which the observed radial velocity is assumed to trace the mass .",
    "for the e1 - 2 ( sy1 ) galaxy ngc 4278 as reported in p05 , @xmath0 ( ) @xmath46 while @xmath0 ( model ) @xmath47 making for a rather ambiguous interpretation of @xmath0 . indeed , the measurement and modelling of @xmath31 and @xmath30 for e galaxies , much like dwarf systems (  1 ) , is complex and suffers from limited radial coverage and relatively large error bars .",
    "large scale dynamical modeling of e galaxies has only been attempted for a few bright systems so far ( e.g. k00 ) .",
    "repeat observations and measurements of new systems by independent teams are direly needed .",
    "to assess the dependence of @xmath7 on galaxy structure for all galaxy types , we use the total light concentration :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the radii within which 20% and 80% of the total light is contained ( kent 1987 ) .",
    "we compute concentrations from sloan digital sky survey ( york et  al .",
    "2000 , [ sdss ] ) @xmath51-band images for 32 spiral , 12 elliptical , and 33 lenticular galaxies in our sample .",
    "we have verified that the concentrations extracted from sdss multi - band galaxy profiles compare well with independent measurements ( e.g. courteau 1996 ; courteau et  al .",
    "the relation between @xmath7 and @xmath52 is shown in .",
    "a fit to the data yields the relation :    @xmath53    the lenticular ( brown open circles ) and elliptical galaxies ( black dots ) in show signs of a match with the @xmath54 relation of spirals , as expected via . for spiral disks ,",
    "the galaxy light concentration correlates well with the bulge - to - total ( b / t ) light ratio . ] .",
    "for the spiral galaxies in our sample , we find @xmath55 . for pure exponential disks , @xmath56 , @xmath5 and both expressions for @xmath7 based on @xmath57 or @xmath52 yield @xmath58 .",
    "we have demonstrated the dependence of @xmath7 on galaxy concentration ( eq .  [ eq : vsc ] ) , as expected theoretically ( eq .  [ eq : jeans ] ) .",
    "we now explore the @xmath54 relation in the context of dynamical galaxy models .",
    "that spheroidal galaxies may trace a similar @xmath54 relation as disk galaxies would suggest that : ( i ) the mass distributions in disks and spheroids are self - similar , and ( ii ) the central velocity dispersions are a reflection of similar environments in galaxy s central regions such that applies across the full hubble sequence . some of the scatter for disk galaxies in may be ascribed to disk star contamination in @xmath1 s ; however we have verified with simulations described below that this effect is small ( @xmath59 ) at least for milky way - type galaxies with pressure - supported bulges .",
    "we have used the self - consistent equilibrium galaxy models of widrow & dubinski ( 2005 [ wd05 ] ) to generate a suite of stable galaxy models for a wide range of disk masses and sizes , bulge and disk mass - to - light ratios , and dark halo masses .",
    "the dynamical models , which include an exponential disk with anisotropic velocity dispersion , a hernquist bulge , and a nfw dark halo are constructed directly from phase - space distribution functions that self - consistently solve the collisionless - boltzmann and poisson equations .",
    "a line - of - sight central velocity dispersion and maximum circular velocity of the disk are measured to mimic actual observations . for each wd05 model",
    ", we calculate the maximum circular rotation speed , @xmath0 , between @xmath60 and 4 disk scale lengths .",
    "@xmath61 is the radius at which the surface brightness equals @xmath62 mag arcsec@xmath63 .",
    "we also calculate the line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath1 within the effective radius of the bulge ; aperture effects are minimal ( just as observed with real data ( f06 ) ) .",
    "the galaxy light concentration @xmath52 is calculated by summing up all the particles out to the edge of the galaxy and using suitable bulge and disk mass - to - light ratios .",
    "we use a random selection of wd05 models constrained to match the size - luminosity and velocity - luminosity relations of galaxies and to obey @xmath64 ( mcgaugh 2005 ; courteau et  al .",
    "2006 ; dutton et  al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the light grey circles in are the result of 950 dynamically stable wd05 models .",
    "the model boundaries correspond to @xmath65 for pure disks and @xmath66 for isothermal systems .",
    "galaxies with central cores or strong spiral arms , that wd05 simulations do not reproduce , can have @xmath67 .",
    "it is intriguing that the measurements for many spheroidal ( e+s0 ) galaxies have @xmath68 ; this departure from theoretical expectations is likely due to anisotropic velocity ellipsoids and/or to the strength of the central cusp .",
    "also , the models extending to high concentrations likely result from the assumption of ( highly concentrated ) nfw halos .",
    "limited as they may be , the wd05 models predict that the distribution of _ stellar _ m / l ratios follows roughly the @xmath54 line .",
    "a calibration of this trend awaits stellar m / l ratios measured from multi - band light profiles or resolved spectra and accurate stellar population models .",
    "the @xmath54 relation ( eq .",
    "[ eq : vsc ] ) is seemingly a product of the size - luminosity and velocity - luminosity relations in galaxies and dynamical considerations .",
    "a precise interpretation remains , however , beyond the range of our analytical models as a detailed understanding of galaxy formation and dynamics is still lacking ( e.g. wd05 ; dutton et  al .",
    "for instance , dissipational processes ( e.g. cooling and feedback , adiabatic compression or expansion of the halo ) and dynamical effects ( e.g. angular momentum transfer ) that play a crucial role in setting @xmath0 and @xmath1 remain poorly constrained . as well , the total light concentration is likely a reflection of uncertain mass accretion histories . from an empirical stand - point",
    ", the scatter of scaling relations that involve dynamical parameters , ( e.g. faber & jackson 1976 or tully & fisher 1977 ) should clearly be reduced by virtue of .",
    "we propose that the @xmath69 relation be used as a new constraint for galaxy formation and dynamical models .",
    "it is unfortunate that in 30 years since wks79 , the number of galaxies with measured central velocity dispersions and circular velocities has only grown from a few dozen to a few hundred .",
    "the situation is especially dire for elliptical galaxies .",
    "it is imperative for the study of galaxy formation and evolution , especially in the wake of large galaxy surveys such as sdss and ukidss ( hewett et  al .",
    "2006 ) , that we remedy this situation with all - sky , deep high - spectral resolution ( @xmath70 ) spectroscopic surveys of thousands of galaxies of all hubble types .",
    "these resolved velocity measurements will impact dramatically the study of galaxy scaling relations , the mass function of galaxies , and tests of baryonic physics to map the coupling between central massive objects , bulges , disks , and halos .",
