    "the problem of the phase transition between liquid and solid states of glasses is an important open problem in material physics @xcite .",
    "glasses are highly disordered solids that undergo a rapid transition as they cool . to study the phase transition , thorpe @xcite proposed a _",
    "model for the glass problem , in which bonds between the atoms are viewed as * fixed - length bars * ( the bonds ) connected by * universal joints * ( the atoms ) with full rotational degrees of freedom . such a structure is called a * planar bar - and - joint framework * ( shortly bar - joint framework , or simply framework ) , and these are fundamental objects of study in the field of * combinatorial rigidity * ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "a bar - joint framework is * rigid * if the only continuous motions of the joints preserving the lengths and connectivity of the bars are rigid motions of the plane , and otherwise it is * flexible*. when a framework is flexible , it decomposes uniquely into inclusion - wise maximal rigid substructures which are called * rigid components * ( shortly components ) ; a component is non - trivial if it is larger than a single edge . in the planar case",
    ", the celebrated maxwell - laman theorem @xcite gives a complete characterization of _ generically _ minimally rigid bar - joint frameworks in terms of a combinatorial condition , which allows rigidity properties to be studied in terms of efficiently checkable graph properties .",
    "the sequence of papers @xcite studies the emergence of _ large _ rigid subgraphs in graphs generated by various stochastic processes , with the edge probabilities and underlying topologies used to model the temperature and chemical composition of the system .",
    "two important observations are that : ( 1 ) very large rigid substructures emerge very rapidly ; ( 2 ) the transition appears to occur slightly below average degree @xmath11 in the the planar bar - joint model .      in this paper",
    ", we study the emergence of rigid components in random graphs generated by a simple , well - known stochastic process : the erds - rnyi random graph model @xmath2 , in which each edge is included with probability @xmath12 , independently .",
    "we consider edge probabilities of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath13 is a fixed constant , and consider the size of the largest rigid components in @xmath2 .",
    "our main result is the following statement about rigid components in @xmath14 .",
    "[ theo : emergence ] let @xmath4 be a constant . almost surely , all rigid components in @xmath14 span @xmath5 , @xmath6 , or @xmath7 vertices . if @xmath8 , then almost surely there are components of size at least @xmath9 .",
    "( a random graph has a property almost surely if the probability of @xmath2 having it tends to one as @xmath15 . )    to the best of our knowledge , this is the first proven result on the emergence of rigid components in random graphs that have , almost surely , close to @xmath16 edges ( the number required for minimal rigidity ) but _ no other special assumptions _ , such as being highly connected or a subgraph of a hexagonal lattice , both of which play critical roles in the previous results on the rigidity of random graphs .",
    "it is important to note that rigidity is inherently a non - local phenomenon : adding a single edge to a graph that has no non - trivial rigid components may rigidify the entire graph ( or removing a single edge may cause a large rigid component to shatter ) .",
    "it is this property of rigidity that distinguishes it from the well - studied @xmath17-core problem in random graph theory .    in the proof of theorem [ theo : emergence ] , we formalize the experimental observation that rigid components , once they appear , are very likely to grow rapidly .",
    "although the proof of theorem [ theo : emergence ] relies mainly on standard tools for bounding sums of independent random variables , our result seems to be the first that directly analyzes rigidity properties of @xmath2 , rather than reducing to a connectivity property .",
    "jackson , et al .",
    "@xcite studied the space of random @xmath11-regular graphs and showed that they are almost surely globally rigid ( see @xcite ) .",
    "they also established a threshold for @xmath2 to be rigid at @xmath18 , which coincides with the threshold for @xmath2 to almost surely have all vertices with degree at least @xmath5 .",
    "the approach in @xcite is based on combining results on the connectivity of random graphs ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4 ) ) and theorems linking rigidity and connectivity proved in @xcite and also @xcite . in the @xmath2 model ,",
    "the techniques there seem to rely on the existence of a very large @xmath19-core , so it does not seem that they can be easily adapted to our setting when @xmath13 is close to @xmath11 ( below the threshold for even the @xmath11-core to emerge @xcite ) .",
    "holroyd @xcite extended the formal study of connectivity percolation @xcite to rigidity percolation in the hexagonal lattice .",
    "he shows , via a reduction to connectivity percolation , that there is an edge - probability threshold for the existence of an infinite rigid component in the hexagonal lattice which is higher than that for connectivity .",
    "it is also shown in @xcite that the infinite component , when it exists , is unique for all but a countable set of edge probabilities @xmath12 .",
    "all the proofs in @xcite rely in an essential way on the structure of the hexagonal lattice ( in particular that a suitably defined tree in its dual graph is a dual of a rigid component ) .",
    "the fundamental @xmath17-core problem in random graph theory has been studied extensively , with a number of complete solutions .",
    "uczak @xcite first proved that for @xmath20 , the ( it is always unique , if present ) @xmath17-core is , almost surely , either empty or has linear size .",
    "pittel , et al . solved the @xmath17-core problem , giving an exact threshold for its emergence and bounds on its size @xcite .",
    "janson and luczak gave an alternative proof of this result , using simpler stochastic processes @xcite .",
    "all these results are based on analyzing a process that removes low - degree vertices one at a time , which does not apply in the rigidity setting .",
    "in this section we give the technical preliminaries required for the proof of theorem [ theo : emergence ] .      an * abstract bar - and - joint framework * @xmath21 is a graph @xmath22 and vector of non - negative * edge lengths * @xmath23 , for each edge @xmath24 .",

    "the maxwell - laman theorem completely characterizes the rigidity of generic planar bar - joint frameworks .",
    "a generic bar - joint framework in the plane is minimally rigid if and only if its graph is @xmath29-tight .",
    "genericity is a subtle concept , and we refer the reader to our paper @xcite for a detailed discussion . in the following it suffices to note that for a fixed @xmath26 almost all @xmath32 are generic , and that , by the maxwell - laman theorem , all generic frameworks @xmath25 have the same rigidity properties .    if @xmath26 contains a spanning laman graph it is * @xmath29-spanning * ( shortly rigid ) .",

    "figure [ fig : laman - examples](b ) has an example of a flexible graph with its components indicated ; they are the two triangles and two trivial components consisting of a single edge only .",
    "an alternative characterization of laman graphs is via so - called * henneberg constructions * , which are local moves that transform laman graphs on @xmath1 vertices to laman graphs on @xmath33 vertices ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6 ) ) .",
