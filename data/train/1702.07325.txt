    "as the rent in larry s new two - bedroom apartment is $ 1000 he will have to look for a roommate to split the cost .",
    "the two rooms are not of the same size , and each has their own advantages , yet fairly dividing the rent between the rooms is larry s primary concern .",
    "moe is interested in moving in with larry , and larry feels that splitting the rent $ 600  $ 400 between the two rooms is fair  for this division of the rent the disadvantages of the second room are offset by its reduced cost .",
    "now , when larry offers the two rooms to moe at these prices , it will not matter to him which room moe chooses ; larry will be content with the other room",
    ". the two new roommates will not be envious of one another and live in a state of _ rental harmony_. larry accomplished this envy - free rent division without taking moe s preferences into account .",
    "this is not a lucky accident of the two person  two bedroom situation : for a three - bedroom apartment larry and moe can fairly divide the rent among the rooms without taking the preferences of a third roommate ",
    "curly  into account .",
    "there is a division of the total rent such that curly can decide for an arbitrary room , and this will leave larry and moe with sufficiently many options to accomplish rental harmony among the three of them . in general , it suffices if @xmath1 roommates know each others preferences to fairly divide the rent of an @xmath2-bedroom apartment ; see asada et .",
    "@xcite for the recent topological proof of this result .    that rental harmony can always be achieved in an @xmath2-bedroom apartment ( under mild conditions ) if the subjective preferences of all @xmath2 future roommates are known was shown by su  @xcite , partially reporting on work of simmons .",
    "the proof uses a combinatorial - geometric lemma about labelings of simplices due to sperner  @xcite .",
    "this makes the proof , especially for low  @xmath2 , accessible to a nonexpert audience . here",
    "our goal is to adapt su s arguments for @xmath3 and give an elementary proof of the extended version of rental harmony explained above , where the preferences of one roommate are unknown .",
    "we first recall the mild conditions stipulated by su to guarantee the existence of an envy - free rent division :    in any division of the rent , each tenant finds at least one room acceptable .",
    "each person prefers a room which costs no rent ( i.e. a free room ) to non - free room .",
    "if a person prefers a room for a convergent sequence of prices then they also prefer the room for the limiting price .    here",
    "we will change these conditions slightly to simplify the proof ; our conditions are :    in any division of the rent , each tenant finds at least one room acceptable .",
    "each person is content with any room that costs no rent .",
    "the roommates do not care about two - cent error margins .",
    "our main theorem then is :    [ thm ] for a @xmath0-bedroom apartment it is sufficient to know the subjective preferences of two roommates to find an envy - free division of rent .    in section  [ sec : sperner ]",
    "we recall sperner s lemma in two dimensions along with its proof .",
    "section  [ sec : proof ] contains our short , combinatorial proof of the main theorem .",
    "begin with a triangle which is subdivided into several smaller triangles . label the three vertices of the original triangle from the set",
    "@xmath4 so each vertex receives a distinct label . then , label each vertex on the edges of the original triangle by either of the labels at the endpoints . finally , label the interior vertices @xmath5 , @xmath6 , or  @xmath0 arbitrarily .",
    "_ sperner labeling _ of a triangle , as in figure  [ spernerlabeling ] .",
    "the result known as _ sperner s lemma _ for a triangle states that there exists some small triangle that exhibits each of the three labels on its vertices .",
    "here we outline the _ trap door proof _ of this result , which goes back to cohen  @xcite and kuhn  @xcite .",
    "select two distinct vertices of the main triangle . to illustrate , we will use those labeled  @xmath5 and  @xmath6 .",
    "imagine each small triangle is a room and any edge with endpoints labeled  @xmath5 and  @xmath6 is a door . notice that each room has zero , one or two doors ; it is impossible to have three doors .",
    "the crucial observation is that a room has one door if and only if it is labeled with all three labels . to prove sperner s lemma",
    ", we will find a room with exactly one door .",
    "observe that there must be an odd number of doors along the boundary of original triangle .",
    "all the boundary doors will fall on one edge of the original triangle , between the main vertices labeled  @xmath5 and  @xmath6 .",
    "starting from the vertex labeled  @xmath5 and going down to the vertex labeled  @xmath6 at the bottom , each time we encounter a smaller edge where the label switches from  @xmath5 to  @xmath6 or from  @xmath6 to  @xmath5 , it s a door .",
    "it must `` switch '' an odd number of times , so there are an odd number of exterior doors .",
    "now , pick one of these exterior doors and walk through it .",
    "either that was the only door in the room , or there is exactly one other door .",
    "if there is another door , walk through that .",
    "keep walking through doors  without backtracking  until you are stuck .",
    "this procedure leads to a room with only door , i.e. a fully labeled room .",
    "see figure  [ labelwithdoors ] .",
    "however , following this procedure , it is possible to wander back out through a door on the boundary of the main triangle .",
    "this is why it is important that there are an odd number of doors on the boundary .",
    "entering through one door and exiting through another still leaves an odd number of boundary doors  namely , at least one  to continue this procedure .        because there is an odd number of boundary doors , this procedure will result in an odd number of fully labeled rooms .",
    "however , there may be other fully labeled rooms which are not accessible from the boundary .",
    "this will happen if and only if the single door of the fully labeled room leads to another inaccessible fully labeled room .",
    "since these inaccessible fully labeled rooms always come in pairs , the total number of fully labeled rooms must be odd .",
    "here we give our combinatorial proof of theorem  [ thm ] .",
    "in particular , our proof is constructive and yields an algorithm to find the fair division of rent .",
    "suppose the total rent is  @xmath7 .",
    "rent divisions among the three rooms are then parametrized by three nonnegative numbers @xmath8 , and @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "that is , the rent of the third room @xmath11 is entirely determined by the rent of the first two rooms @xmath12 and  @xmath13 . in the @xmath12-@xmath13-plane",
    "the set of admissible rent divisions is a triangle bounded by the lines @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "now place a grid of vertices on this triangle , one vertex at every cent value , that is , every point @xmath17 in the triangle , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 have at most two decimal places .",
    "there is a natural triangulation of the triangle with these vertices that uses only horizontal , vertical , and diagonal edges .",
    "every vertex of this triangulation now corresponds to a rent division that does not use fractions of a penny . for each such rent division",
    "we ask both larry and moe which room they would prefer if the rent was split in this specific way .",
    "we record their preferences as a tuple of two integers @xmath18 with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number of the room that larry prefers and @xmath21 represents moe s favorite room .",
    "there are three vertices of the triangulation ",
    "the original vertices of the triangle  where two rooms are free . for those rent divisions",
    "we kindly ask larry and moe to make distinct choices , that is , the original vertices of the triangle all have labels @xmath18 with @xmath22 .    at every vertex of the triangulation",
    "transform a label @xmath18 into a single - digit label according to the following rules : label the vertex  @xmath0 if the previous label was @xmath23 , @xmath24 , or @xmath25 , label  @xmath5 for @xmath26 , @xmath27 , or @xmath28 , and @xmath6 for @xmath29 , @xmath30 , or @xmath31 .",
    "the three original vertices of the triangle receive pairwise distinct labels since larry and moe decided for different rooms whenever two rooms were free simultaneously . on every edge of the triangle",
    "the vertices of the triangulation have the same label  only one room is free . and this label is one of the two labels we find at the endpoints of that edge .",
    "we defined a sperner labeling .",
    "thus we can find a small triangle that has vertices of all three labels .",
    "the corresponding rent divisions are all within a margin of error of two cents .",
    "it is simple to check that seeing all three labels for this rent division ( with small error margin ) implies that both larry and moe prefer at least two distinct rooms , and each room is preferred by at least one of them .",
    "for example , it is impossible that larry only likes room  @xmath5 since one vertex is labeled  @xmath5 ; and it is impossible that both larry and moe dislike room  @xmath0 since one vertex is labeled  @xmath6 .",
    "this means that it does not matter for which room curly decides for this rent division , both larry and moe will be left with one of their favorite rooms .    in a forthcoming extended version of this supplemental note",
    "we intend to explain higher - dimensional versions of this construction .",
