    "a bimatrix game is a two - player game in strategic form .",
    "the nash equilibria of a bimatrix game correspond to pairs of vertices of two polyhedra derived from the payoff matrices .",
    "these vertex pairs have to be `` completely labeled '' , which expresses the equilibrium condition that every pure strategy of a player ( represented by a `` label '' ) is either a best response to the other player s mixed strategy or played with probability zero .",
    "this polyhedral view gives rise to algorithms that compute a nash equilibrium .",
    "a classical method is the algorithm by lemke and howson ( 1964 ) which follows a path of `` almost completely labeled '' polytope edges that terminates at nash equilibrium .",
    "the lemke  howson ( lh ) algorithm has been one inspiration for the complexity class ppad defined by papadimitriou ( 1994 ) of computational problems defined by such path - following arguments , which includes more general equilibrium problems such as the computation of approximate brouwer fixed points . an important result proved by chen and deng ( 2006 ) and daskalakis , goldberg , and papadimitriou ( 2009 )",
    "states that every problem in the class ppad can be reduced to finding a nash equilibrium of a bimatrix game , which makes this problem `` ppad - complete '' .",
    "( the problem of finding the nash equilibrium at the end of a _ specific _ path is a much harder , namely pspace - complete , see goldberg , papadimitriou , and savani 2013 . )    if an algorithm takes exponentially many steps ( measured in the size of its input ) for certain problem instances , these are considered `` hard '' instances for the algorithm .",
    "savani and von stengel ( 2006 ) constructed bimatrix games that are hard instances for the lh algorithm .",
    "their construction uses `` dual cyclic polytopes '' which have a well - known vertex structure for any dimension and number of linear inequalities .",
    "morris ( 1994 ) used similarly labeled dual cyclic polytopes where all `` lemke paths '' are exponentially long .",
    "a lemke path is related to the path computed by the lh algorithm , but is defined on a _ single _ polytope that does not have a product structure corresponding to a bimatrix game .",
    "the completely labeled vertex found by a lemke path can be interpreted as a symmetric equilibrium of a symmetric bimatrix game . however , as in the example in figure  [ fbr ] below , such a symmetric game may also have nonsymmetric equilibria which here are easy to compute , so that the result by morris ( 1994 ) seemed unsuitable to describe games that are hard to solve with the lh algorithm .",
    "the `` imitation games '' defined by mclennan and tourky ( 2010 ) changed this picture . in an imitation game ,",
    "the payoff matrix of one of the players is the identity matrix .",
    "the mixed strategy of that player in any nash equilibrium of the imitation game corresponds exactly to a symmetric equilibrium of the symmetric game defined by the payoff matrix of the other player . in that way ,",
    "an algorithm that finds a nash equilibrium of a bimatrix game can be used to find a symmetric nash equilibrium of a symmetric game .",
    "( the converse statement that a bimatrix game can be `` symmetrized '' , see proposition  [ p - sym ] below , is an earlier folklore result stated for zero - sum games by gale , kuhn , and tucker 1950 . )    in one sense the two - polytope construction of savani and von stengel ( 2006 ) was overly complicated : the imitation games by mclennan and tourky ( 2010 ) provide a simple and elegant way to turn the single - polytope construction of morris ( 1994 ) into exponentially - long lh paths for bimatrix games . in another sense ,",
    "the construction of savani and von stengel was not redundant .",
    "namely , the square imitation games obtained from morris ( 1994 ) have a single completely mixed equilibrium that is easily computed by equating all payoffs for all pure strategies .",
    "savani and von stengel ( 2006 ) extended their construction of square games with long lh paths ( and a single completely mixed equilibrium ) to non - square games that are _ simultaneously _ hard for the lh algorithm and `` support enumeration '' , which is another natural and simple algorithm for finding equilibria .",
    "the support of a mixed strategy is the set of pure strategies that are played with positive probability . given a pair of supports of equal size , the mixed strategy probabilities are found by equating all payoffs for the other player s support , which then have to be compared with payoffs outside the support to establish the equilibrium property ( see dickhaut and kaplan 1991 ) .    in this paper , we extend the idea of imitation games to games where one payoff matrix is arbitrary and the other is a set of unit vectors .",
    "we call these _ unit vector games_. an imitation game is an example of a unit vector game , where the unit vectors form an identity matrix . the main result of this paper is an application of unit vector games : we use them to extend morris s construction to obtain non - square bimatrix games that use only one dual cyclic polytope , rather than the two used by savani and von stengel , and which are simultaneously hard _ both _ for the lh algorithm and support enumeration .",
    "this result ( theorem  [ t - main ] ) was first described by savani ( 2006 , section  3.8 ) .    before presenting this construction in section  [ s - hard ] ,",
    "we introduce in section  [ s - unit ] the required background on labeled best response polytopes for bimatrix games , in an accessible presentation due to shapley ( 1974 ) that we think every game theorist should know .",
    "we define unit vector games and the use of imitation games , and their relationships to the lh algorithm .",
    "we will make the case that unit vector games provide a general and simple way to construct bimatrix games using a single labeled polytope .",
    "to our knowledge , unit vector games were first defined and used by balthasar ( 2009 , lemma 4.10 ) in a different context , namely in order to prove that a symmetric equilibrium of a nondegenerate symmetric game that has positive `` symmetric index '' can be made the _",
    "unique _ symmetric equilibrium of a larger symmetric game by adding suitable strategies ( balthasar 2009 , theorem  4.1 ) .",
    "in this section , we first describe in section  [ s - poly ] how labeled polyhedra capture the `` best - response regions '' of mixed strategies where a particular pure strategy of the other player is a best response , and how these are used to identify nash equilibria . in section  [ s - unitv ]",
    "we introduce unit vector games , whose equilibria correspond to completely labeled vertices of a single labeled polytope . in section  [ s - redu ]",
    "we discuss the role of imitation games for symmetric games and their symmetric equilibria .",
    "finally , in section  [ s - lemke ] , we show how lemke paths defined for single labeled polytopes are `` projections '' of seemingly more general lh paths in the case of unit vector games ( theorem  [ t - proj ] ) .",
    "consider an @xmath0 bimatrix game @xmath1 .",
    "we describe a geometric - combinatorial `` labeling '' method , due to shapley ( 1974 ) , that allows an easy identification of the nash equilibria of the game .",
    "it has an equivalent description in terms of polytopes derived from the payoff matrices .",
    "let @xmath2 be the all - zero vector and let @xmath3 be the all - one vector of appropriate dimension .",
    "all vectors are column vectors and @xmath4 is the transpose of any matrix @xmath5 , so @xmath6 is the all - one row vector .",
    "let @xmath7 and @xmath8 be the mixed - strategy simplices of the two players , @xmath9 it is convenient to identify the @xmath10 pure strategies of the two players by separate _ labels _ where the labels @xmath11 denote the @xmath12 pure strategies of the row player  1 and the labels @xmath13 @xmath10 denote the @xmath14 pure strategies of the column player  2 .",
    "consider mixed strategies @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we say that @xmath17 has label @xmath18 for @xmath19 if @xmath20 is a pure best response of player  2 to  @xmath17 .",
    "similarly , @xmath21 has label @xmath22 for @xmath23 if @xmath22 is a pure best response of player  1 to  @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , we say that @xmath17 has label @xmath22 for @xmath23 if @xmath24 , and that @xmath21 has label @xmath18 for @xmath19 if @xmath25 .",
    "that is , a mixed strategy such as @xmath17 has label @xmath22 ( one of the player s own pure strategies ) if @xmath22 is not played .    in a nash equilibrium ,",
    "every pure strategy that is played with positive probability is a best response to the other player s mixed strategy . in other words ,",
    "if a pure strategy is not a best response , it is played with probability zero .",
    "hence , a mixed strategy pair @xmath26 is a nash equilibrium if and only if every label in @xmath27 appears as a label of @xmath17 or of  @xmath21 .",
    "the nash equilibria are therefore exactly those pairs @xmath26 in @xmath28 that are _ completely labeled _ in this sense .    as an example , consider the @xmath29 game @xmath1 with @xmath30 the labels @xmath31 represent the pure strategies of player  1 and @xmath32 those of player  2 .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] shows @xmath7 and @xmath8 with these labels shown as circled numbers .",
    "the interiors of these triangles are covered by _ best - response regions _ labeled by the other player s pure strategies , which are closed polyhedral sets where the respective pure strategy is a best response .",
    "for example , the best - response region in @xmath8 with label  @xmath33 is the set of those @xmath34 such that @xmath35 and @xmath36 , due to the particularly simple form of @xmath37 in ( [ ab ] ) .",

    "these outside facets are opposite to the vertex where only that pure strategy is played ; for example , label  @xmath33 is the label of the facet of @xmath7 opposite to the vertex @xmath38 . in figure  [ f1 ]",
    "there is only one pair @xmath26 that is completely labeled , namely @xmath39 with labels @xmath40 and @xmath41 with labels @xmath42 , so this is the only nash equilibrium of the game .     and @xmath8 for the game ( [ ab ] ) . ,",

    "a support enumeration algorithm that tests supports picked uniformly at random without replacement from the set @xmath324 of all @xmath12-sized subsets of @xmath323 has to test an expected number of @xmath325 supports before finding an equilibrium support .    to find the expected number of guesses required to find an equilibrium we use a standard argument ( motwani and raghavan 1995 , p.  10 ) .",
    "consider a random enumeration of the elements of  @xmath324 .",
    "the elements of @xmath326 , which we index by @xmath327 , correspond to non - equilibrium supports .",

    "then @xmath330 is the random variable equal to the number of supports checked before the first equilibrium is found . for a single element of @xmath326 , the probability that it is in front of all elements of @xmath322 is @xmath331 .",
    "hence , using the linearity of expectation , @xmath332 this shows that the expected number of support guesses until an equilibrium is found is given by , as claimed .    in proposition",
    "[ p - hide ] , we assume that the algorithm does not identify any particular pattern as to which supports should be tested . one way to achieve this is to permute the columns of the game randomly ( if one knows that the payoff matrix @xmath61 of player  2 is derived from a dual cyclic polytope , then this random order can be identified with a specialized method , see savani 2006 , section 3.6 ; this is not a general method for solving games so we do not consider it ) . however , unless one distorts the polytope @xmath59 in ( [ qni ] ) , this still leaves a payoff matrix of player  1 where each unit vector appears three times . in this case , even if the algorithm picks only columns where each unit vector appears once , there would be @xmath333 possible supports which define a set @xmath324 of size @xmath333 rather than @xmath334 in proposition  [ p - hide ] .",
    "such a set @xmath324 is still exponentially large compared to the set @xmath322 of @xmath294 supports that define a nash equilibrium . in that case",

    "[ t - main ] finding a nash equilibrium of the @xmath293 unit - vector game that corresponds to the triple morris polytope @xmath263 takes at least time @xmath336 with the lemke  howson algorithm , and on expectation time @xmath337 with an algorithm that tests in random order arbitrary supports of size @xmath123 of the game .",
    "the length of the lh paths follows from theorem  [ t - morris ] , proposition  [ p - corpaths ] , and theorem  [ t - proj ] . for the support - testing algorithm",

    "to conclude , we note results on the following combinatorial problem : let @xmath12 be even and let @xmath241 be a string of @xmath14 labels from @xmath93 , and consider the set of gale evenness bitstrings of length @xmath10 which encode the vertices of the labeled polytope @xmath247 .",
    "the problem is to find a second completely labeled gale evenness string other than @xmath240 .",
    "casetti , merschen , and von stengel ( 2010 ) have shown that this is equivalent to finding a second perfect matching in the _ euler graph _ with nodes @xmath11 and edges defined by the euler tour @xmath342 .",
    "the edges in a perfect matching encode the pairs of @xmath33s in a gale evenness bitstring , which is completely labeled because the edges cover all nodes .",
    "vgh and von stengel ( 2015 , theorem  12 ) give a near - linear time algorithm that finds such a second perfect matching that , in addition , has opposite _ sign _ , which corresponds to a nash equilibrium of positive index as it would be found by a lemke path ( which , however , can be exponentially long ) .",
