    "assume the permuted forest @xmath257 is the one on the right hand side of figure [ fig : exrecons ] .",
    "the steps of the reconstruction are summarized in figure [ fig : recons ] .",
    "we get that the unique triple @xmath222 such that @xmath260 is : @xmath267          to prove that @xmath221 is surjective , we have to show that the reconstruction procedure of the previous section always finishes with a valid output .",
    "+ assume the procedure comes to an end at step @xmath7 before all the integer labels are recovered ( where @xmath7 is for example non hat , the hat case having a similar proof ) .",
    "it means that we have already recovered all the labels of vertex @xmath268 identified as the one containing @xmath265 ( or @xmath269 ) prior to this step .",
    "this is impossible by construction provided @xmath268 is not the root vertex of the seed tree since the number of times a vertex is identified for the next step is equal to its number of thorns , plus its number of edges , plus twice the number of loops that have the same greek label as @xmath268 , plus twice the incoming arrows . using lemma [ lem : loops ] , we have that the sum of the two latter numbers is twice the number of loops of @xmath268 . as a consequence , the total number of times the recovering process goes through @xmath268 is exactly ( and thus never more than ) the degree of @xmath268 .",
    "if @xmath270 is the root vertex of the seed tree , the situation is slightly different due to the fact that we recover label @xmath170 before we start the procedure . to ensure that the procedure does not terminate prior to its end , we need to show that the @xmath271-th time the procedure goes through the root vertex is right after all the labels of the forest have been recovered .",
    "again , this is always true because :    the last element of a vertex to be recovered is the label of the maximum element of the associated block .",
    "consequently , all the elements of a vertex are recovered only when all the elements of the descending vertices ( through both arrows and edges ) are recovered .",
    "lemma [ lem : tree ] states that the ascendant / descendant structure involving both edges and arrows is a tree rooted in @xmath270 . as a result",
    ", the procedure goes the @xmath270-th time through @xmath270 only when all the elements of all the other vertices are recovered .",
    "in the orientable case , one can use schur symmetric functions and the irreducible characters of the symmetric group to prove the identity in equation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this requires : ( i ) ( @xmath272 ) the murnaghan - nakayama rule ( * ? ? ?",
    "7.17.3 ) , ( ii ) ( @xmath273 ) finding the number of semistandard young tableaux of hook shape @xmath274 and type @xmath108 which is just @xmath275 , and ( iii ) using inclusion exclusion .",
    "one could try to replicate this on @xmath276 and obtain an algebraic proof of theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "we show the outcome after step ( i) using ( * ? ? ?",
    "steps ( ii) and ( iii) appear quite less tractable .    @xmath277 .",
    "for the formula of theorem [ thm : main ] to be complete , we need to observe the following cases :      when @xmath65 and @xmath282 , which can only occur if @xmath283 ( we assume @xmath284 , the elementary tridimensional array with @xmath188 and @xmath189 elsewhere ) the whole summand @xmath285 on the rhs of equation reduces to : @xmath286\\\\ & \\times\\frac{(n-2r)!p'!q'!\\left ( r - p ' \\right)!\\left ( r- q ' \\right)!}{2^{2r - p'-q'}}\\binom{t}{u , v , u+v}\\prod_{i , j , l}{\\binom{i-1}{j , k , j+k}}^{q_{ijk}}{\\binom{i-1}{j , k , j+k-1}}^{(p'+q')_{ijk}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]"
