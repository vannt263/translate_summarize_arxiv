    "this solves the navigation problem of the @xmath10 robots ; they move in @xmath11 simultaneously along trajectories determined by @xmath23 and each converges to its target point provided that @xmath29 . in @xcite , such a morse function has been constructed using the basic idea that each robot will repel each other and will be attracted by its target point .",

    "let @xmath2 be a real analytic function satisfying ( i)-(iii ) above on a compact connected real analytic domain with boundary ( i.e. analytically diffeomorphic to a closed ball ) @xmath3 in @xmath12 and @xmath30 . by definition",

    "above , it is possible to have @xmath85 ultimately constant or there may be infinitely many nontrivial steps of the process .",
    "the proofs of the first two claims are given in section  [ pruf ] as lemma  [ bir ] , corollary  [ iki ] and lemma  [ uc ] .",
    "they depend heavily on @xmath2 s being real analytic and morse .",
    "the main tool in the proofs is the ojasiewicz inequality @xcite : for @xmath91 a critical point of the real analytic function @xmath2 and @xmath92 , there are a neighborhood @xmath93 of @xmath91 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 satisfying for all @xmath96 , @xmath97 we will call the triple @xmath98 a ojasiewicz neighborhood .",

    "the proof of theorem  [ ana ] is valid for a more general claim regarding a more general set - up for the process .",

    "[ ekstra ]    the proof of theorem  [ ekstra ] follows closely that of theorem  [ ana ] , both of which we will present below .",
    "before stating and proving the claims , we will need several definitions and observations .    first , for the sake of simplicity of the notation , let us restrict ourselves ( except in lemma  [ uc ] ) to the case @xmath108 .",
    "( @xmath109 oversimplifies the problem @xcite . )",
    "whatever we present and claim below applies similarly for other dimensions as well .",
    "now , let @xmath110 denote the set of points at which the vector field @xmath4 has the @xmath37-th component zero ; i.e. @xmath111 where @xmath112 .",
    "observe that every critical point of @xmath2 lies in @xmath113 for each @xmath114 .",
    "let @xmath115 be a nondegenerate critical point of @xmath2 .",
    "since the hessian of @xmath2 at @xmath115 is nondegenerate by assumption , @xmath116 is nonzero and @xmath116 and @xmath117 are linearly independent for every pair of distinct @xmath37 and @xmath52 .",
    "hence we conclude that around @xmath115 each @xmath118 and @xmath119 are smooth real analytic submanifolds of @xmath3 of codim 1 and 2 respectively . furthermore , again thanks to the nondegeneracy assumption , the tangent spaces of @xmath118 s at @xmath115 constitute a central hyperplane arrangement of coordinate planes . therefore , the intersection of any collection consisting of @xmath120 of @xmath118 s is a smooth real analytic submanifold around @xmath115 as well , of codim @xmath120 .",
    "now let us investigate the process more closely in case @xmath2 is a real analytic morse function .",
    "the point @xmath78 of type @xmath81 which the process converges to at @xmath73-th step lies in the codim-2 ( in general codim-@xmath7 ) submanifold @xmath121 ; in other words , @xmath73-th step converges to a point in @xmath122 . at that point @xmath4",
    "is perpendicular to the slice .",
    "we may view the process as a chase within the subspaces @xmath123 s , which are submanifolds of codim  2 near the critical points .",
    "so , for example , in a neighborhood of some @xmath26 if @xmath124 is empty for some @xmath35 then the process can not converge to @xmath91 .",
    "now we are ready for the claims and proofs . in the first two statements , we assume that @xmath2 is a real analytic function , not necessarily morse . observe that the process is still well - defined in the absence of being morse .",
    "let @xmath125 be a real analytic function .",
    "consider the sequence @xmath126 of stationary points of the process described above . if @xmath127 is an accumulation point of the sequence",
    "@xmath85 then it is a critical point of @xmath2 .",

    ", we must have @xmath129 which proves the lemma .",
    "now we prove by contradiction that the latter case is not possible .",

    "for any given @xmath133 , there is a sufficiently large @xmath134 such that if @xmath135 we have @xmath136 where avg@xmath137 is the average of @xmath138 over @xmath139 .",
    "let @xmath140 and @xmath141 . the set @xmath142 can be considered as the set of limit points in @xmath93 of all point sequences @xmath143 with @xmath144 , @xmath145 being any increasing sequence of positive integers .",
    "observe that @xmath142 lies in the intersection of the type-1 slice @xmath146 and the @xmath147-level set .",

    "note that @xmath175 and that , say , @xmath176 for large @xmath52 s . on the other hand using ( [ voja ] ) we observe , as in the proof of ojasiewicz inequality ( see e.g. @xcite ) , that there is a finite upper bound , for sufficiently large @xmath52 but independent from @xmath52 , for the length of @xmath131 in @xmath171 : @xmath177 where @xmath178 . here @xmath179 is the moment when @xmath131 leaves @xmath93 .",
    "this upper bound can be made arbitrarily small ( that holds for larger @xmath52 ) , in particular , much less than @xmath180 .",
    "this contradicts with ( [ leng ] )",
    ". therefore there must be infinitely many points of type 1 in @xmath93 and the proof by contradiction follows recursively .    from the above proof",
    ", it follows that sufficiently small neighborhoods of an accumulation point do not let trajectories out .",
    "this proves the following statement .",
    "let @xmath125 be a real analytic function and @xmath91 an accumulation point of the sequence @xmath85 of stationary points of the process . then @xmath181 .",
    "[ iki ]    to finish the proof of the main theorem , we need the following    let @xmath18 be a primal navigation function on @xmath182 . then except when the initial point is a saddle point , convergence to a saddle point is impossible for a @xmath90-dense subset of primal navigation functions .",

    "now in this new setting , @xmath188 has the first @xmath184 components nonnegative .",
    "therefore the first @xmath184 coordinates of the position can not converge to 0 unless they are already 0 .",
    "a necessary condition for that is when @xmath189 for some @xmath190 .",
    "furthermore in such a case , convergence is possible only when there are slices which contain integral curves in their intersection with @xmath191 ; more precisely , for the slice @xmath192 with the projected vector field @xmath193 , @xmath194 contains some integral curves of @xmath193 .",
    "we will argue that such a case does not occur for a @xmath90-dense subset of primal navigation functions .",
    "first we perturb @xmath2 to a primal navigation function @xmath89 with the same minimum point @xmath15 such that the local stable manifold @xmath195 of each critical point @xmath91 of @xmath89 and the slices @xmath83 ( for every @xmath35 and @xmath196 sufficiently close to @xmath91 ) intersect transversely .",
    "it is straightforward to see that a sufficiently small generic real analytic coordinate change in a small neighborhood of @xmath91 achieves this locally .",
    "for example , a small generic rotation centered at the critical point would work .",
    "however we need further that this real analytic perturbation can be done globally , fixing @xmath15 .",
    "we propose the following construction in case @xmath3 is the closed unit ball .",
    "the construction in the general case will follow since @xmath3 is analytically diffeomorphic to the closed unit ball .",
    "let @xmath197 be a point in the interior of @xmath3 such that for each critical point @xmath91 of @xmath2 the line @xmath198 is transverse and non - orthogonal to @xmath199 , i.e. each intersection @xmath200 is non - tangent to @xmath198 and has a radial ( i.e. @xmath198 ) component .",
    "since these conditions are open , the set of such @xmath197 s is open and dense in @xmath3 .",
    "below we take @xmath197 as the origin in the unit closed ball @xmath3 .",
    "the construction below can be made for the general case similarly .",
    "now we consider the real analytic diffeomorphism @xmath201 , @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the distance @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "we require @xmath43 satisfy @xmath206 for some @xmath207 . the radial perturbance @xmath208 fixes @xmath15 and moves the other critical points",
    "slightly , the extent of which can be controlled by @xmath209 .",
    "one can choose @xmath43 such that the radial perturbance of each slice at each critical point is nontrivial , which is required for transversality .",
    "we also choose the domain @xmath16 of @xmath2 so that the condition ( ii)@xmath62 is satisfied in @xmath210 where @xmath171 is a compact subset of @xmath3 . by making @xmath209 small , one can have @xmath208 arbitrarily @xmath90-close to i d and @xmath211 . these choices guarantee that the function @xmath212 is defined and is a real analytic morse function with the same minimum as @xmath2 ; its critical points are in one to one correspondence with , arbitrarily close to and of the same index as those of @xmath2 .",
    "moreover the condition ( ii)@xmath62 is satisfied by @xmath89 on @xmath22 provided that @xmath208 is sufficiently @xmath90-close to i d .",
    "thus we obtain a primal navigation function satisfying the required transversality conditions .",
    "finally let us note that since the condition that @xmath213 contains integral curves of @xmath214 is a closed condition , the construction above gives the perturbation required for almost all @xmath197 , infinitely many @xmath43 and sufficiently small @xmath209 .",
