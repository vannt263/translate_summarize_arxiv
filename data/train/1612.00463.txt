    "the y chromosomes are genetically degenerated , smaller in size , with less functional genes than their x - chromosomes partners @xcite .",
    "several models were suitably presented as mechanisms to serve as a reinforcement @xcite or to even originate y degeneration itself @xcite .",
    "additionally , the predominance of x chromosomes is also responsible for the shrinking of the y chromosomes during millions of years of evolution @xcite .",
    "there are many forces acting simultaneously on the sex - chromosomes evolution .",

    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we study the structure of the coupled logistic map for xy chromosomes . in sec .",
    "[ sec : butterfly ] we show how the initial conditions affects the number of chromosomes and the number of individuals . in sec .",
    "[ sec : constraints ] we analyse the mathematical constraints which prevents the chaotic behavior of y chromosomes . in sec .",
    "[ sec : analytical ] we set the analytical description and the fundamental ideas of our model for xy - chromosomes evolution . our conclusions and the discussion of our results are treated in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we modified the logistic map in order to describe the mathematical asymmetry of the xy chromosomes and their coupled properties as well .",
    "the discrete equations read as @xmath0,\\label{my}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 is the fertility , @xmath2 is the population threshold , @xmath3 and @xmath4 stands for the number of x and y chromosomes , respectively .",
    "equation ( [ mx ] ) is the traditional logistic map , here applied for the x chromosomes .",
    "equation ( [ my ] ) is the modified logistic map for the y chromosomes .",
    "these are non - overlapping populations .",
    "the term @xmath5 in equation ( [ my ] ) accounts for the proportion of sexual chromosomes , 3x for each y chromosome .",
    "note that the maximum number of x ( y ) chromosomes is limited to @xmath6 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "our equations implicitly assume that the same number of males and females will be reached in the steady state .",
    "we assume @xmath7 hereafter .    our model for the population growth",
    "is based solely in the xy chromosomes . in the steady state",
    "we expect that the number of males ( xy ) and females ( xx ) should be approximately the same . in terms of the number of chromosomes , it means that x will be three times greater than y chromosomes .",
    "the corresponding number of males ( @xmath8 ) is given by the number of xy pairs of chromosomes .",
    "for @xmath9 , the number of males is equal to @xmath10 , since we assume that all of the y chromosomes can be combined with their x partners . on the other hand , if @xmath11 , the maximum number of males is limited to @xmath12 , as summarized by @xmath13    and the number of females ( @xmath14 ) will be given by the half of the remaining x chromosomes , as follows @xmath15    equations ( [ eq : nmdif ] ) and ( [ eq : nfdif ] ) provides the maximum number of males in a given population of x and y chromosomes .",
    "figure [ fig : a ] shows that the population of males and females are equal and stable .",
    "although the proportion of males and females are roughly the same , x chromosomes appears 3 times more often than y , as predicted by equations ( [ mx ] ) and ( [ my ] ) .",
    "surprisingly , figure [ fig : a](a ) shows that nearly after 618 generations there is an equal number of males and females for about 10 generations .",
    "we have seen that this effect happens only once until the thousandth generation .",
    "we are exploring this effect in depth and it should be published elsewhere .",
    "in this section we have iterated the maps ( [ mx ] ) and ( [ my ] ) in order to show the sensibility of the system to the initial conditions regarding the population size .",
    "we also show the lyapunov expoents for x and y chromosomes . to pinpoint the differences on the population size , figure [ fig : b ]",
    "shows the trajectories of males , females , x and y chromosomes over the generations ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "we varied the initial condition on @xmath17 with the other parameters fixed .",
    "figure [ fig : b](a ) and [ fig : b](b ) shows the evolution of the x and y chromosomes , and figure [ fig : b](c ) and [ fig : b](d ) shows the trajectories of the number of males and females . in all the four cases we see that the initial condition on y had little effect only on the first 10 ( a and b ) and 20 generations ( c and d ) .",
    "this is the first sign that the system is not sensible on the initial conditions of y.    chaos is the result of a very rich dynamics .",
    "the damped oscillations and the void of steady state are necessary ( although not sufficient ) conditions for chaotic regimes @xcite .",
    "the butterfly effect can be seen here ( on x chromosomes ) by means of the dynamics of the population growth regarding different initial conditions .",
    "we varied the initial conditions in order to verify the butterfly effect .",
    "figure [ fig : c ] shows the sensitivity of the xy - logistic model in the initial population size of x chromosomes .",
    "it is no surprise , however , that x exhibits chaos , since it represents the well - known logistic map .",
    "the ultimate hallmark of chaos is shown by the lyapunov exponents for it is the quantity that characterizes the rate of separation of infinitesimally close trajectories @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : d ] shows the lyapunov exponents ( le ) for both x and y chromosomes .",
    "a positive le is an indication of chaotic regimes .",
    "surprinsingly , we have @xmath18 for a portion of the fertility spectrum and @xmath19 for the whole fertility range studied .",
    "this indicates that the y chromosomes escape from the chaotic regime .     between 2 and 4.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]",
    "the exhibition of chaos in the logistic map is intrinsically related to the shape of the corresponding parabola , @xmath20    where the values of @xmath1 determines the chaotic region @xcite .",
    "we considered @xmath21 for the sake of simplicity .",
    "equation ( [ my ] ) can also be written as @xmath22    where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . whether there is chaos in the y chromosome s evolution",
    "can be checked comparing equations ( [ parx ] ) and ( [ pary ] ) , i.e. , the parabola for y is the same parabola for x if    @xmath26    since @xmath23 , the parabola for y can not be chaotic .",
    "in addition , the condition @xmath27 leads to the nonphysical result , @xmath28 .",
    "negative numbers are not allowed in the discrete spectrum of any population model and of course in the xy - logistic model .",
    "therefore we conclude that the parabola for the y chromosomes never behaves within the chaotic regime such as in the x chromosomes .",
    "the classical verhulst s model for the population change can be described by the differential equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of individuals in the population , @xmath1 is the malthusian growth rate and @xmath2 is the carrying capacity of the environment of a certain type of individuals .",

    "[ fig : e ] we have shown chromosomes evolution with different initial conditions .    notice that for greater values of @xmath36 , the faster is the stabilization of @xmath12 and @xmath10 , i.e. , there are necessary less interactions to reach saturation .",
    "conversely , with small values of @xmath36 , the number of @xmath10 oscillates and have a higher maximum than with greater @xmath36 .",
    "there is a special initial condition , @xmath37 , in which @xmath38 and thus @xmath39which keeps the homogeneous relation @xmath40 for any time @xmath41 .    in this vein",
    ", it is interesting to observe how is the evolution of @xmath10 in terms of @xmath12 to check the proportion of the number of males and females .",
    "considering the implicit function @xmath42 we have from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dify ] ) , @xmath43.\\ ] ]    using eq .",

    "( [ eq : yxalg ] ) is exemplified by the numerical solutions in the figure [ fig : f ] , where we have shown the behavior of the x and y chromosomes evolution for different initial conditions .",
    "figure [ fig : f](a ) shows that for small @xmath36 , @xmath10 grows very fast .",
    "this means that the universe is dominated by y until some x chromosomes are free to combine and produce females .",
    "as @xmath12 grows , the saturation is reached at @xmath47 .",
    "the figure [ fig : h ] shows the time evolution of chromosomes and the ( maximum ) number of males and females .",
    "the initial state , @xmath48 , allows from the very beginning ( @xmath49 ) the population with the maximum number of males ( figure [ fig : h](a ) ) : for each y chromosome there is an x chromosome and thus the total number of males matches the number of y chromosomes . on the other hand",
    ", the initial condition @xmath50 ( figure [ fig : h](b ) ) populates the environment with many free y chromosomes , which are not combined due to the small initial @xmath51 chromosomes .",
    "thus , in this case , until @xmath10 is greater than @xmath12 , the number of males is equal to @xmath12 and still growing without the creation of any female individuals . when @xmath12 becomes greater than @xmath10 , nearly at @xmath52 , the saturation of male individuals is obtained and it starts to decrease while the number of females starts to grow . nearly at @xmath53",
    "both number of males and females stabilizes and are approximately the same since @xmath12 and @xmath10 reach the saturation limit at @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "we have showed that chaos is not present on y - chromosomes evolution when it is coupled with x chromosomes .",
    "an heuristic explanation for the y - chromosome degeneration by means of deterministic chaos is given as follows .",
    "the original y appeared in some mammals ( therian ) approximately 180 million years ago @xcite .",
    "small differences in initial conditions occured on the primeval x chromosomes  due to quantum fluctuations in the light of quantum biology @xcite  might have led to the sex - determining genes .",
    "we showed that another mathematical asymmetry , in addition to @xcite , might in turn be responsible for the y - chromosome degenarion and to the origin of the sex - determining mechanisms .",
    "the butterfly effect has printed a permanent signature in the course of their evolution in the primeval era ."
