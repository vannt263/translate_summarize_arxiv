    "in recent years two - dimensional topological phases have received growing attention from the science community .",
    "they represent a novel class of quantum matter at zero temperature whose bulk properties are robust against weak interactions and disorders .",
    "topological phases may be divided into two families : _ doubled _ ( with time - reversal symmetry , or trs , preserved ) , and _ chiral _ ( with trs broken ) .",
    "either type may be exploited to do fault - tolerant ( or topological ) quantum computing @xcite .    _",
    "chiral _ topological phases were first discovered in integer and fractional quantum hall ( iqh and fqh ) liquids .",
    "mathematically , their effective low - energy description is given by chern - simons theory @xcite or ( more generally ) topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) @xcite .",
    "one characteristic property of fqh states is ground state degeneracy ( gsd ) , which depends only on the spatial topology of the system @xcite and is closely related to fractionization @xcite of quasiparticle quantum numbers , including fractional ( braiding ) statistics @xcite . in some cases the gsd has been computed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "chern - simons theories are formulated in the continuum and have no lattice counterpart . doubled topological phases , on the other hand , do admit a discrete description .",
    "the first known example was kitaev s toric code model @xcite .",
    "more recently , levin and wen ( lw ) @xcite constructed a discrete model to describe a large class of doubled phases .",
    "their original motivation was to generate ground states that exhibit the phenomenon of string - net condensation @xcite as a physical mechanism for topological phases .",
    "the lw model is defined on a trivalent lattice ( or graph ) with an exactly soluble hamiltonian .",
    "the ground states in this model can be viewed as the fixed - point states of some renormalization group flow @xcite .",
    "these fixed - point states look the same at all length scales and have no local degrees of freedom .    the lw model is believed to be a hamiltonian version of the turaev - viro topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) in three dimensional spacetime @xcite and , in particular cases , discretized version of _ doubled _ chern - simons theory @xcite . like kitaev s toric code model @xcite",
    ", we expect that the subspace of degenerate ground states in the lw model can be used as a fault - tolerant code for quantum computation .",
    "in this paper we report the results of a recent study on the gsd of the lw model formulated on a ( discretized ) closed oriented surface @xmath1 .",
    "usually the gsd is examined as a topological invariant@xcite of the 3-manifold @xmath2 . in a hamiltonian approach accessible to physicists",
    ", we will explicitly demonstrate that the gsd in the lw model depends only on the topology of @xmath1 on which the system lives and , therefore , is a topological invariant of the surface @xmath1 .",
    "we also show that the ground state of any lw hamiltonian on a sphere is always non - degenerate .",
    "moreover , we examine the lw model associated with quantum group @xmath3 , which is conjectured to be equivalent to the doubled chern - simons theory with gauge group @xmath4 at level @xmath5 , and compute the gsd on a torus .",

    "this means that the ground state hilbert spaces on different graphs can be identified ( up to a mutation transformation ) and all graphs are equally good .",
    "one consequence of the uniqueness of the mutation tranformation is that the degrees of freedom in the ground states do not depend on the specific structure of the graph . in this sense",
