    "significant progress has been made in recent years in observations of galactic black hole binaries ( bhbs ) ( cf .",
    "tanaka & lewin 1995 for a review ) .",
    "optical studies show that the dynamic mass of the compact object in many black hole candidates ( bhcs ) is well above 3 @xmath0 , the upper limit on the mass of neutron stars .",
    "bhcs are so classified because of the similarity of their x - ray properties to those of cyg  x-1 , the first dynamically proven bh with @xmath1",
    ". such similarity includes the presence of an ultra - soft spectral component with a characteristic blackbody ( bb ) temperature of 0.5 - 2 kev , and an underlying power - law hard tail that extends beyond 100 kev . both",
    "are rarely seen from ns binaries .",
    "the ultra - soft component is emitted from the inner region of the accretion disk , close to the bh horizon .",
    "the origin of the hard tail is still unclear , but is believed to be related to the lack of a solid surface on bhs and the strong gravitational field near the horizon .",
    "systematic optical studies of bhcs selected based on these criteria have been very successful in finding compact objects with masses @xmath2 .",
    "however , an ultra - soft component of 0.5 - 1.0 kev is absent in the bright state x - ray spectra of at least 5 ( gs  2023 + 338 , gro  j0422 + 32 , gro  j1719 - 24 , 1e  1740.7 - 2942 and grs  1758 - 258 ) of about two dozen known bhcs .",
    "neither is it observed in cyg  x-1 and gx339 - 4 when they are in the so - called hard ( or low ) state . both",
    "gs  2023 + 338 and gro  j0422 + 32 are dynamically confirmed bhbs .",
    "it is thus an outstanding puzzle why the ultra - soft component is missing in their x - ray spectra .",
    "none of these sources is an eclipsing system , so the outer edge of the disk is not likely to block radiation from the inner disk .    in this letter",
    ", we suggest that the strength of the ultra - soft component is directly related to the bh spin .",
    "the presence ( or absence ) of such a component would , therefore , depend critically on the specific angular momentum of the bh and the orientation of its spin axis with respect to the rotation direction of the accretion disk .",
    "we assume a geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk ( novikov & thorne 1973 ; shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) orbiting a kerr bh in the equatorial plane .",
    "the bh spin affects the properties of the inner disk region in at least two ways ( bardeen , press , & teukolsky 1972 ) .",
    "first , the radius of a kerr bh horizon , @xmath3 , is smaller than that of a non - spinning bh , @xmath4 $ ] , where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the bh mass ) , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the bh angular momentum ) . the dimensionless specific angular momentum , @xmath9 , varies from 1 to 1 . for maximally spinning bhs , @xmath10 and @xmath11=@xmath12=@xmath13=0.5@xmath11=@xmath14 .",
    "second , the radius of the last ( marginally ) stable orbit of the accretion disk is a function of the bh spin , i.e. , @xmath15^{1/2}\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath16 $ ] , @xmath17 ; the lower and upper signs are for a prograde disk ( i.e. , rotating in the same direction of the bh , or @xmath18 ) and a retrograde disk ( @xmath19 ) , respectively .",
    "therefore , a disk around a kerr bh may extend all the way in to the horizon , @xmath20=1)=@xmath13 or be expelled to @xmath21=1)=9@xmath13 , as compared to the canonical schwarzschild case , @xmath22=0)=6@xmath13 .",
    "the local gravitational energy release per unit area from the surface of the disk is also a function of the bh spin ( page & thorne 1974 ) , @xmath23,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the mass accretion rate , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . from eq .",
    "( 2 ) , the effective bb temperature of the disk , @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the stefan - boltzmann constant , actually peaks at an annulus slightly beyond @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 varies slowly from 0.63 to 0.77 for @xmath35 from 1 to 1 .",
    "the observed disk spectrum , however , bears several important corrections to this simple formula .",
    "first , on the hot inner disk where most x - rays are emitted , electron scattering may dominate over the free - free absorption and so causes the color temperature to be greater than the effective temperature ( ross , fabian , & mineshige 1992 ) . as a result ,",
    "the inner disk radiates approximately like a `` diluted '' bb , @xmath36 ( ebisuzaki , hanawa , & sugimoto 1984 ) , where @xmath37 is the planck function and @xmath38 is the color correction factor .",
    "detailed calculations ( shimura & takahara 1995 ) , including general relativistic effects , show that @xmath38 depends only very weakly on @xmath39 so that it can be approximated by a constant @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath40 depends weakly on @xmath6 and @xmath24 such that @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the eddington accretion rate .",
    "therefore , the dependence of @xmath40 on @xmath35 , although unknown , should also be weak and we adopt @xmath45 in this paper .",
    "the second important correction is due to general relativistic ( gr ) effects near the bh horizon , e.g. , the gravitational redshifts and focusing , which cause both the observed color temperature and integrated flux to deviate from the local values , depending on the inclination angle of the disk , @xmath46 , and the bh spin ( cunningham 1975 ) .",
    "here we introduce two additional correction factors , @xmath47  the fractional change of the color temperature , and @xmath48  the additional change of the integrated flux due to viewing angle and gr effects .",
    "we note that in the newtonian limit @xmath49 , so the pure gr effect on the observed flux is @xmath50 . from cunningham ( 1975 )",
    ", we derive these correction factors for several viewing angles and for @xmath51 and 0.998 .",
    "the results are listed in table 1 .",
    "the calculations at @xmath52 are for prograde disks .",
    "retrograde disks should produce less effects than the @xmath53 case .",
    "it is clear that the gr effects cause that ( 1 ) the spectrum is redshifted at small @xmath46 but blue - shifted at large @xmath46 , ( 2 ) the flux is smaller than the newtonian flux at small @xmath46 but greater at large @xmath46 ( gravitational focusing ) , and ( 3 ) the spin of the bh induces even larger deviation .    there is a simple relation between the bolometric luminosity of the disk and the peak emission region , @xmath54 ( makishima _ et al . _  1986 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath55 depends on both @xmath24 and @xmath56 but not on @xmath6 .",
    "our numerical integrations over eq .",
    "( 2 ) confirm that the above relation is accurate to within 10% for a wide range of the parameter space .",
    "including the temperature and flux corrections we introduced above , the observed flux is related to the local disk luminosity by @xmath57 , and the observed color temperature is @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , the inner disk radius , @xmath32 , for a source at distance @xmath59 can be derived as , @xmath60^{1/2 } \\left [ \\frac{f_{\\rm col}f_{\\rm gr}(\\theta , a_{\\ast})}{t_{\\rm col}}\\right]^2.\\ ] ] combining eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , one can thus solve for both @xmath32 and @xmath56 , if @xmath61  and @xmath46 are known .",
    "the largest theoretical uncertainty in eq .",
    "( 3 ) is from @xmath40 for prograde kerr bhs .",
    "based on our discussion above , however , the uncertainty in @xmath40 is @xmath62% which will cause an error of no more than 20% in @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the spin of a bh may strongly influence both the disk color temperature and the disk luminosity , as illustrated in figs .  1 - 2 for typical @xmath61  and @xmath24 .",
    "we see that a prograde bhbs shall usually have a higher color temperature than the non - spinning systems , while retrograde bhbs , especially the more massive ones , will have a softer disk component which may in many cases escape our detection . on the other hand ,",
    "the conversion efficiency of the gravitational energy to radiation , @xmath63 , is a function of @xmath35 _ only _ and increases parabolicly from @xmath643% to @xmath6430% as @xmath35 changes from 1 to 1 ; it is @xmath646% for a schwarzchild bh ( thorne 1974 ) . to be in line with most x - ray observations , in fig",
    "2 we plot the disk luminosity above 2 kev , @xmath652 kev ) as a function of @xmath35 .",
    "figs .  1 - 2 show that the accretion disk spectrum of a bhb becomes distinctively different only when the bh spins extremely rapidly .",
    "it is thus natural to classify bhbs into three groups , namely , extreme prograde systems ( @xmath66 ) , non- or slowly - spinning systems ( @xmath67@xmath35@xmath67@xmath680 ) , and extreme retrograde systems ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "* extreme prograde systems . *",
    "this class currently includes gro  j1655 - 40 and possibly grs  1915 + 105 , which are the only two known galactic superluminal jet sources . for gro  j1655 - 40 , its @xmath61  and @xmath46",
    "have been optically determined as 7.02@xmath700.22@xmath0 and 69.5@xmath71@xmath700@xmath71.08 ( orosz & bailyn 1997 ) .",
    "spectral fitting to its asca x - ray spectrum during its 1995 august outburst gives @xmath72=1.36 kev and an unabsorbed bb flux of @xmath73 ergs s@xmath74@xmath75 ( zhang _ et al . _",
    "applying eq .",
    "( 3 ) to a schwarzschild bh with @xmath34=0.7 , @xmath76=0.368 , and @xmath77=1.03 , we derive an inner disk radius of @xmath32=23.3 km or 2.3@xmath13 for a 7@xmath0 bh .",
    "we note that all the observables have very small statistical errors and for a schwarzschild bh the quoted @xmath40 and @xmath47 are exact ; the inferred @xmath32 for gro  j1655 - 40 thus contains at most 10% error .",
    "therefore , it will be extremely difficult to reconcile the discrepancy between the observed @xmath32 and the theoretical minimum of @xmath78 for a non - spinning bh .",
    "the simplest solution is to assume that the bh in gro  j1655 - 40 is spinning . solving eq .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 3 ) self - consistently with @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , we find that @xmath82 km and @xmath83 .",
    "although we have used values of @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath84 and @xmath45 in the calculation , based on our above discussion the lower limit to @xmath35 is 0.7 .",
    "therefore we conclude that gro j1655 - 40 most probably contains a kerr bh spinning at between 70% to 100% ( most likely value of 93% ) of the maximum rate .",
    "we note that @xmath56 derived above is actually consistent with that inferred independently from the x - ray timing data .",
    "a high frequency qpo of @xmath64300 hz was observed in gro  j1655 - 40 ( remillard 1997 ) .",
    "one of its possible origins is the trapped @xmath76-mode oscillations near the inner edge of the disk ( okazaki , kato & fukue 1987 ) . by including the gr effects , perez _ et al . _  ( 1997 ) show that the fundamental frequency of the radial modes is given by @xmath85 . if the @xmath64300 hz qpo is indeed due to this mode , then @xmath86 , which corresponds to @xmath35=0.95 , in agreement with our result .",
    "it is , however , not clear how such models can explain why the qpo is more prominent at higher energies and why it is only observed when the energy spectrum becomes the hardest ( remillard 1997 ) .",
    "the case for grs  1915 + 105 is less straightforward because its bh mass is unknown .",
    "however , this source also has a similar bb component and a high frequency qpo during its recent outburst .",
    "we can estimate the radius of the inner edge of the disk using its x - ray spectrum and then , by assuming the observed qpo is also due to the fundamental g - mode radial oscillations , derive the bh spin self - consistently . given @xmath872.27 kev and @xmath88 = 4.4@xmath89 ergs s@xmath74@xmath75 ( belloni _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) , the inner disk radius is @xmath6440 km , for a distance of 12.5 kpc and @xmath46=70@xmath71  ( mirabel & rodriguez 1994 ) .",
    "this implies a schwarzschild bh mass of @xmath90 or an extreme kerr bh mass of @xmath6427@xmath0 with a prograde disk . on the other hand ,",
    "applying the trapped @xmath76-mode model to the @xmath6467 hz qpo ( morgan _ et al . _  1996 , 1997 ) yields",
    "@xmath91 for a non - spinning bh and @xmath92 for an extreme prograde kerr bh ( nowak _ et al . _",
    "the consistency between these two approaches thus suggests that grs  1915 + 105 may contain a kerr bh of @xmath6430@xmath0 which is also spinning near the maximum rate .",
    "* non- or slowly - spinning systems .",
    "* there are several bhbs whose inner disk radii have been reliably measured based on their bright state x - ray spectra ( e.g. , tanaka & lewin 1995 ) and their @xmath6  and @xmath46 have also been determined optically .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( 1 ) to calculate their @xmath56 and the results are listed in table 2 , which also includes the two superluminal jet sources . quite different from gro  j1655 - 40",
    ", these sources show little sign of bh spin . while the theoretical uncertainties in @xmath32 for non - spinning bhs are small , the observational uncertainties in @xmath46 and @xmath6 for these systems are greater than those for gro  j1655 - 40",
    ". it is still intriguing to see that the bhs in these bhbs _ appear _ to be spinning slowly .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the three nominal bhbs all have a lower @xmath93 than the two superluminal sources .",
    "1 shows that when other system parameters are equal , a prograde disk at @xmath94 always has a higher @xmath93 than the disk at @xmath95 since @xmath96 .",
    "thus , although their system parameters are mostly unknown , most of other ultra - soft bhcs listed in table  3.1 of tanaka & lewin ( 1995 ) may also be slowly - spinning bhbs .",
    "we do not know , though , if they are slow spinors at birth , or they have been slowed down , or their spin axis simply lies close to the disk plane .",
    "* extreme retrograde systems . *",
    "the absence of a detectable ultra - soft component above 1 - 2 kev in the x - ray bright state could imply an even softer disk spectrum of @xmath97 0.3 kev .",
    "if so , such a bhb will likely contain an extreme kerr bh with a retrograde disk ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "while there is yet no proof that they are , we postulate that gro  j1719 - 24 , gs  2023 + 338 , and gro  j0422 + 32 are such kerr bh systems .",
    "the existence of the extreme retrograde bhbs can be confirmed unambiguously only when one detects a weak ultra - soft component at a lower temperature from those sources in their bright outburst state .",
    "a reliable detection will not be easy , though , because it requires an adequate detector response down to 0.1 kev and a small interstellar absorption column .",
    "cyg  x-1 is a particularly interesting source in our accreting kerr bh picture because it shows the characteristics of _ both _ a prograde and a retrograde bhb .",
    "this is mainly related to its distinctive spectral state transitions , whose nature has not been understood properly .",
    "many models suggest that the state transitions are accompanied by significant @xmath24 changes , in conflict with recent observations which showed approximately constant total luminosity throughout the state transitions ( zhang _ et al._1997b ) .",
    "another misconception is that the x - ray spectrum of cyg  x-1 in its hard state always contains _ only _ a power law with an energy spectral index of 0.5 - 1.0 and a spectral break at 50 - 100 kev .",
    "recently , however , a very low temperature bb component was clearly detected by rosat ( balucinska - church _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) and confirmed by asca ( ebisawa _ et al._1996 ) , with _ kt_@xmath98@xmath640.1 - 0.2 kev and an estimated luminosity of @xmath99 erg / s . according to figs .  1 and 2 for @xmath6 of @xmath100 and @xmath24 of @xmath101 g s@xmath74 , the observed low temperature bb component clearly suggests a retrograde system . on the other hand , observations in 1996",
    "indicate that the inner disk radius dropped by a factor of 23 and @xmath24 increased by less than a factor of 2 when cyg  x-1 changed from the hard to the soft state ( zhang _ et al . _",
    "1997b ) .",
    "the inner disk radius in cyg  x-1 is likely always at the last stable orbit since @xmath24 is always high .",
    "if so , we find that the observed decrease of @xmath32 during the hard - to - soft transition can be simply explained by the _ reversal _ of the disk rotation from a retrograde disk to a prograde disk , or quantitatively , by @xmath35 switching from 0.75 to 0.75 .",
    "a smaller @xmath32 also causes an increase of the observed @xmath93 by a factor of @xmath642.5 and of the observed @xmath55 by a factor of @xmath1026 ( figs .  1 - 2 ) .",
    "if the bh were not spinning , the temperature increase would require a significant increase in @xmath24 so that the bb luminosity would have jumped by a factor of 40 , which is not seen in the observations .",
    "in summary , all the observed bhbs can be unified within the framework that the bh in a binary system may spin up to the maximally allowed speed and both prograde and retrograde systems exist .",
    "the two galactic superluminal jet sources are the only known rapidly prograde systems so far , implying that the formation of the relativistic jets is perhaps related to both the rapid spin of the bh and the prograde configuration .",
    "the majority of other known ultra - soft bhbs appear to contain slowly spinning bhs .",
    "we have also suggested that the bhbs without any detectable ultra - soft component above 2 kev may be extreme kerr bhbs with retrograde disks .",
    "the canonical bhb cyg  x-1 may actually switch from a retrograde system in its normal hard ( or low ) state to a prograde system in the soft ( or high ) state , when the accretion disk reverses its rotation direction temporarily , due to possibly the unstable nature of the wind accretion from its supergiant massive companion . although it may sound absurd at first ,",
    "the accretion disk reversal is actually not at all surprising for cyg x-1 because it is a wind accreting system .",
    "two and three dimensional numerical simulations show that the flip - flop of an accretion disk rotation can indeed occur in such systems ( e.g. , matsuda , inoue , & sawada 1987 ; benensohn , lamb and taam 1997 ; ruffert 1997 ) .",
    "the concept of disk reversal , however , can not be applied to low mass bhbs , such as gs1124 - 683 , because their accretion material from roche - lobe over - flow gets a strong preference of rotation from the orbital motion .",
    "the state transitions in these systems , often accompanied by significant @xmath24 changes , are therefore due to entirely different mechanisms .",
    "perhaps the lower @xmath24 causes the inner accretion disk to be truncated in the quiescent ( hard ) state and thereby forms advection dominated accretion flow ( e.g. , narayan and yi 1995 ) . in all our calculations ,",
    "we consider only the high @xmath24 state in which we believe the accretion disk extends to the last stable orbit .",
    "we have up to this point carefully avoided discussion of hard x - ray production in bhbs .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that the hard x - ray luminosity of a prograde system is , on average , much lower than that of a retrograde system .",
    "this seems to imply that the hard x - ray emitting region is related to the volume between the inner disk boundary and the bh horizon . for cyg",
    "x-1 in the soft state , its hard x - ray luminosity ( @xmath10320 kev ) is about a factor of 10 - 20 lower for the observed shrinkage of the inner disk radius by a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "so , the hard x - ray luminosity seems to be roughly proportional to the volume inside @xmath32 .",

    "<S> we discuss the observational consequences of black hole spin in x - ray binaries within the framework of the standard thin accretion disk model . when compared to theoretical flux distribution from the surface of a thin disk surrounding a kerr black hole </S>",
    "<S> , the observed x - ray properties of the galactic superluminal jet sources , gro  j1655 - 40 and grs  1915 + 105 , strongly suggest that each contains a black hole spinning rapidly in the same direction as the accretion disk . </S>",
    "<S> we show , however , that some other black hole binaries with an ultra - soft x - ray component probably harbor only non- or slowly - spinning black holes , and we argue that those with no detectable ultra - soft component above 1 - 2 kev in their high luminosity state may contain a fast - spinning black hole but with a retrograde disk . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , all classes of known black hole binaries are united within one scheme . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we explore the possibility that spectral state transitions in cyg  x-1 are simply due to temporary disk reversal , which can occur in a wind accretion system . </S>"
