    "inflation @xcite is currently the most well - studied and successful paradigm for very early universe cosmology .",
    "most importantly , inflation is the first scenario based on causal physics to give a mechanism @xcite to generate perturbations on the scales currently observed .",
    "the predicted spectrum is nearly scale - invariant and close to gaussian .",
    "these predictions have been spectacularly confirmed in recent cosmic microwave ( cmb ) measurements @xcite .",
    "as already pointed out @xcite a decade before the development of inflationary cosmology , any early universe scenario which yields an almost adiabatic and nearly scale - invariant spectrum of fluctuations on scales which are super - hubble at late times ( e.g. the time of equal matter and radiation ) will yield an angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropies in agreement with observations .",
    "inflation is the first but not the only model which yields such fluctuations .",
    "it is valuable to investigate alternative scenarios to obtain a scale - invariant spectrum of curvature fluctuations using causal microphysics . on one hand",
    ", one does not know apriori whether inflation is indeed the right paradigm . at least in its current realizations based on coupling scalar fields to einstein gravity",
    "it suffers from a number of conceptual challenges ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and if inflation in fact turns out not to be the correct paradigm , alternatives are certainly needed . on the other hand , even if inflation turns out to be the correct paradigm , competing scenarios are useful because they may provide guides to future experiments which will allow inflation to pass further non - trivial tests .",
    "for example , the  string gas cosmology \" alternative to inflation @xcite predicts a blue tilt of the spectrum of gravitational waves , whereas inflationary models developed within the context of einstein gravity generically produce a small red tilt .",
    "thus , future measurements of the slope of the spectrum of gravitational waves could either falsify inflation or allow it to pass a further non - trivial test . in this sense having alternatives to inflation",
    "makes early universe cosmology a healthier science .",
    "recently , there is an increasing interest in a class of alternatives to inflation in which the scale - invariance of the fluctuations is induced not by the de - sitter - like expansion of space , but by the evolution of another matter field .",
    "examples are the _ conformal cosmology _ of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , in which the evolution of a conformal scalar field induces scale - invariant fluctuations in an axion - like field to which it couples , the _ pseudo - conformal cosmology _ of @xcite and the _ galilean genesis _ model of @xcite in which a galileon field which dominates the background dynamics of space - time induces scale - invariant fluctuations of a spectator scalar fields .    in this paper",
    "we propose a mechanism by which the scale - invariance of the spectator scalar fields can be transferred to a scale - invariant spectrum of curvature fluctuations .",
    "the standard curvaton mechanism does not work since in this case the curvature fluctuations are quadratic in the spectator scalar field , and hence the fluctuations will be neither scale - invariant nor gaussian .",
    "the key to our construction is to introduce a linear coupling between the nontrivial background geometry and the spectator scalar .",
    "the three scenarios mentioned above all can be viewed as particular realizations of an _ emergent cosmology _ , in the sense that there is a spectator field whose equation of motion looks like that of a standard scalar field in a de sitter background geometry , while the actual space - time is not de sitter at all .",
    "for example , in the _ galilean genesis _",
    "scenario it is an evolving galileon field which couples to a spectator scalar field like a de sitter metric would , while the galileon field leads to a metric which approaches that of flat minkowski space - time as time tends to @xmath1 . in this case , the expanding background expansion is in fact emergent from an initial static phase ( as is also postulated to happen in string gas cosmology @xcite ) .",
    "there is , however , a generic problem which arises if one generates a scale - invariant spectrum of fluctuations of a spectator scalar field in the hope of then obtaining scale - invariant curvature perturbations @xcite :    * if the scalar field has no potential term , the scale - invariant perturbation of the scalar field couples quadratically to the curvature perturbation @xmath2 as @xmath3 , and thus the resulting curvature perturbation is neither scale invariant nor gaussian . *",
    "if the spectator scalar field has a potential ( say , a fixed mass term ) and its background value is excited and evolving in time ( like the inflation and the curvaton are in inflationary cosmology ) , then - although the background scalar field allows a linear coupling between the spectator field fluctuations and the curvature perturbation - the background spectator scalar field will destroy the emergent background phase in the far past , when fluctuations are supposed to be generated .",
    "actually , the solution to the above problems is built - in in those theories . to see this ,",
    "it is helpful to pause and revisit the `` @xmath0-problem '' for inflation @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-problem states that in a time - dependent background , a massless field @xmath4 typically gets a mass of order of the hubble parameter , unless the masslessness is protected by a symmetry such as a shift symmetry @xcite . for example , in the context of supergravity models , then if the field comes from a khler potential , the lagrangian will have the structure @xmath5~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the effective vacuum energy in the system , and @xmath7 is the planck mass . expanding this equation ,",
    "the @xmath4 field obtains a mass of order hubble parameter @xmath8 : @xmath9 v_0     \\simeq v_0 + \\mathcal{o}(1 ) h^2\\phi^2 ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is believed that the above effect is so general that it becomes a problem of inflation .",
    "there is good reason to believe that the same term should also naturally arise in emergent universe scenarios where the hubble parameter is emergent ( specifically in the galilean genesis model ) .",
    "thus , a light scalar field @xmath4 ( our spectator scalar field ) obtains an emergent mass .",
    "the emergent mass , on one hand , breaks the shift symmetry .",
    "this will induce a linear coupling of the scalar field fluctuations to curvature perturbations , and will allow a scale - invariant spectrum of the spectator field to induce a scale - invariant spectrum of curvature fluctuations . on the other hand , the mass of the spectator field is emergent and thus the induced potential of the field does not destroy the initial emergent background .",
    "specifically , it does not break the emergent nature of expansion of the universe .    ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    for this purpose , starting with the lagrangian @xmath10 for a massless scalar field , we shall consider the corrected matter lagrangian @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a mass parameter characteristic of the new physics which yields the corrections to the lagrangian .",
    "this mass will induce non - trivial dynamics of @xmath4 which in turn leads to a linear coupling between fluctuations in @xmath4 and curvature perturbations .",
    "alternatively , we could also consider a gravitational action with induced non - minimal coupling of @xmath4 to gravity ( a similar mechanism was proposed in @xcite ) : @xmath13 this modified action also leads to a direct linear coupling between fluctuations of @xmath4 and curvature perturbations .    for definiteness ,",
    "in the present work , we only consider the first possibility , which is inspired by a khler potential in supersymmetry.$ ] coupling to the potential term .",
    "however , here we consider an over - all exponential term .",
    "for the galilean case , we have to because there is no potential for the galilean field .",
    "on the other hand , in the pseudo - conformal case , we could consider the case where the exponential only couples to the potential , and the result should not change much .",
    "] we expect that the modified gravity case should have a similar effect , via a conformal transformation .",
    "consider the galilean scenario @xcite . in the galilean case ,",
    "the gravity sector is standard , with @xmath14 the galilean field @xmath15 has an action @xmath16~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the galilean - gravitation system has a solution describing an emergent universe : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a constant .",
    "this solution is valid at early times @xmath19 here we have solved the equation of motion of @xmath15 to second order , and other equations to first order . as one can check , this suffices for the calculation of the equation of motion for the isocurvaton .    for simplicity , we assume that the galilean field decays before condition ( [ eq : early - approx ] ) breaks down",
    ". technically it should be straightforward to generalize our analysis to the @xmath20 region , provided that a well defined uv completion is given and the equations of motion are solved numerically .",
    "as noticed in @xcite , the @xmath15 field has a blue spectrum , instead of a nearly scale invariant spectrum of perturbations",
    ". however , it was also noticed that if a massless scalar field @xmath4 is introduced which couples to the galilean like @xmath21 then in the galilean background the @xmath4 field feels an effective metric with a conformal factor @xmath22 . inserting the galilean solution @xmath23",
    ", it follows that @xmath4 obeys the same equation of motion like a minimally coupled scalar field in de sitter space and thus obtains a scale invariant power spectrum if the fluctuations start out in their quantum vacuum state .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the ghost condensate can decay to excitations of the @xmath4 matter field via the coupling in ( [ eq : coupling1 ] ) , thus allowing for a graceful exit from the stage of galileon domination and onset of the usual radiation phase of standard cosmology .",
    "however , as noticed in @xcite , there is a problem to convert the perturbation in @xmath4 to curvature perturbations .",
    "this is because @xmath4 has no potential or background motion .",
    "the curvature perturbation couples to the energy density of @xmath4 , and is thus proportional to @xmath24 . as a result ,",
    "the curvature perturbation is neither scale invariant nor gaussian .",
    "if one tries to apply the curvaton scenario @xcite and gives the @xmath4 field a potential which leads to slow rolling , one encounters the next obstacle : now @xmath4 has a non - vanishing background energy density which renders the emergent galilean phase unstable .",
    "our main point is that if @xmath4 is an originally massless direction , whose mass is uplifted by the hubble parameter , then there is no such instability since the mass vanishes deep in the galileon phase . here",
    "we consider an example realizing this uplifting .      in this subsection",
    ", we introduce a model where the additional scalar field arises from the khler potential , or a phenomenological analog .",

    "the gravitational sector is standard .    to simplify the calculation",
    ", we assume @xmath26 the first inequality is discussed in section [ sec : galil - genes - example ] and is an early time approximation . the second inequality is a condition for the effective field theory expansion of the new physics to be valid , and it also ensures that @xmath4 remains a sub - dominant component , i.e. a spectator scalar field .    at the homogeneous and isotropic background level , the matter action for @xmath4 takes the form @xmath27~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to leading order in the approximations ( [ eq : gapprox ] ) , we obtain the solution @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a constant .",
    "the second term is much smaller than the first one in a vast parameter space , considering that @xmath30 is huge at early times .",
    "thus the motion of @xmath4 is very slow .    in the following calculation ,",
    "we self - consistently treat @xmath4 as a constant .",
    "we shall come back to the time variation of @xmath4 when discussing the spectral index .",
    "we start from the adm metric : @xmath31 with perturbations @xmath32 and @xmath33 defined as @xmath34 the matter fields @xmath4 and @xmath15 are perturbed as @xmath35 we have the freedom to set another gauge condition .",
    "however for the moment we shall not do that and leave the time shift @xmath36 as a residual gauge symmetry .    with the assumptions in equation ( [ eq : gapprox ] )",
    ", one can solve for @xmath32 and @xmath33 using the constraint equations and reinsert the solutions into the action .",
    "the second order lagrangian then takes the form @xmath37 here , the first three lines represent the free lagrangian , and the 4th to 6th lines are the mixing terms .",
    "the coefficients of the two terms in the last line are small",
    ". we can self - consistently neglect these two terms .",
    "the self - consistency check involves obtaining the solution making the approximation , inserting back into the action , and checking that the contributions of these two terms are indeed small .",
    "one can define canonically normalized fields via @xmath38 in terms of these fields the lagrangian becomes @xmath39 note that @xmath40 or @xmath41 appear in the above action only in terms of the gauge - invariant combination @xmath42 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath43 appears in a gauge - dependent form .",
    "this gauge - dependence is due to the approximation @xmath44 which we have made . by this approximation",
    ", we are asserting that @xmath29 is sub - dominant , thus couples to gravity only weakly and is treated as a spectator scalar field on a fixed background . at higher orders , we would recover an explicitly gauge - invariant form . note that if we were to choose a uniform @xmath4 gauge , then the parameters in the gauge transformation between the gauge we are using and the uniform @xmath4 gauge will be large , which mixes different orders of the @xmath45 terms in the second order action .    to put it in another way",
    ", the @xmath44 approximation has separated gauge transformations into two classes , the `` small gauge transformations '' and `` large gauge transformations '' , as illustrated in figure [ fig : slices ] .",
    "small gauge transformations transform between uniform total energy density slice and the flat slice , or any other slices not too far away from it . on the other hand ,",
    "large gauge transformations transform between the above slices and the uniform @xmath4 gauge .",
    "the action ( [ eq : l - sigma - chi ] ) can be used when only small gauge transformations are considered . while to consider a large gauge transformation , one need to use the full second order action , without the approximation @xmath44 .",
    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]    now we make the further assumption that @xmath46 such that the last term in equation ( [ eq : l - sigma - chi ] ) can be treated as a perturbation when solving the equation of motion of @xmath43 .",
    "then the @xmath42 field has a free equation of motion @xmath47 this is the same equation of motion as a free scalar field @xmath43 in a de - sitter background ( with time @xmath48 being replaced by the conformal time ) .",
    "this demonstrates that @xmath43 will acquire a scale - invariant spectrum in this background @xcite if it starts out in its vacuum state .",
    "the back - reaction of @xmath43 on @xmath42 is given by @xmath49 in the context of the emergent paradigm it is natural to assume that both canonical fields start in their vacuum state .",
    "this is similar to the assumption that scalar matter fields in the de sitter phase of inflationary cosmology begin in their vacuum state - although the justification of these assumptions are very different . with these initial conditions ,",
    "the free evolution for @xmath43 leads to the following form of the mode functions : @xmath50 inserting this solution into the @xmath42 equation , we have @xmath51 where @xmath52 stands for the exponential integral function .",
    "here , the first term comes from the quantum fluctuation of @xmath42 , and the rest of the terms are sourced by @xmath43 fluctuations . and @xmath53 is a relative phase between the original quantum perturbations of the galilean and the induced perturbations .",
    "note that the last two terms are subdominant because on super - hubble scales @xmath54 , and thus they are small compared to the second term . for the same reason , the second term will dominate over the first term in most of the parameter space .    as discussed",
    "above , we can safely work in the uniform total energy density slice , in which the curvature perturbation is @xmath55 . making use of ( [ canonical ] ) and ( [ sigmaeq ] ) and inserting into the definition of the power spectrum we find the scale - invariant result @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the effective hubble parameter at hubble crossing , which can be inferred from the second order solution of the equation of motion of @xmath15",
    ".. however , we can solve the relation between @xmath58 and @xmath59 to higher orders using the background field equation @xmath60 .",
    "this second order solution is needed if we want to calculate the spectral index .",
    "similarly , we replaced @xmath29 to @xmath4 in the power spectrum to take into account the slow but non - vanishing @xmath61-dependence . ]",
    "this result is true for all times @xmath48 before the time @xmath62 when either the galileon or the field @xmath4 decays .",
    "for simplicity , we shall assume that both fields decay into normal radiation at the same time @xmath62 ( e.g. via the process studied in @xcite ) .",
    "then , the time @xmath62 is the time when the conversion of isocurvature perturbation to curvature fluctuation shuts off .",
    "note that it is the non - trivial coupling between @xmath4 and @xmath43 introduced in our construction which leads to the scale - invariance of the curvature fluctuations .",
    "the intrinsic spectrum of curvature fluctuations ( in the absence of a @xmath4 field ) would be deep blue ( scalar spectral index @xmath63 ) , as can be verified by doing the calculation with the first term in ( [ sigmaeq ] ) only .",
    "the power spectrum is growing until the @xmath15 and @xmath4 fields decay .",
    "to relate to observations , the time appearing in the power spectrum should be taken to be the time @xmath62 when the galileon and spectator scalar field have decayed into radiation .",
    "after the time @xmath62 , the isocurvature mode disappears and the curvature fluctuation remains constant in time ( for modes of interest to us which are far outside the hubble radius in the radiation phase which starts after the time @xmath62 .",
    "note that the increase of the power spectrum in time does not spoil the scale invariance because the scale invariance is determined by the @xmath61-dependence of the power spectrum .",
    "instead , the increase in time indicates that the perturbation in the isocurvature direction is continuously converting to curvature perturbation before it decays .",
    "this time dependence is similar to what occurs in the curvaton scenario in inflationary cosmology where the presence of isocurvature fluctuations see a continuously growing curvature mode . and",
    "the inflaton are decoupled ( except via gravity ) , there is a conserved quantity @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the energy density of the curvaton field .",
    "the total curvature fluctuation @xmath2 is not conserved before the decay of curvaton .",
    "instead , it is related to @xmath66 by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the total energy and total pressure . in our case , @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( which is the analog of @xmath72 ) .",
    "thus @xmath2 scales as @xmath73 and @xmath74 scales as @xmath75 .",
    "however , there is explicit coupling between @xmath4 and the galilean .",
    "thus while we hope this footnote still provides an intuitive understanding , an explicit calculation is also needed , as we give in the main text . ]",
    "the amplitude of the resulting spectrum of curvature fluctuations depends on the values of the mass scales in the lagrangian , and on the values of @xmath29 and @xmath62 .",
    "it is natural to assume @xmath76 , and to choose @xmath77 to be parametrically larger than @xmath78 , i.e. @xmath79 with the constant @xmath80 .",
    "for consistency of the approximations , we must choose @xmath29 parametrically smaller than @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath81 with constant @xmath82 .",
    "in this case , we find [ cond1 ] p _ ~ ^2 ^-3 ( m_p t_d ) ^-4 which is parametrically smaller than @xmath83 if @xmath84 .     instead of @xmath85 because the former is the time when the fluctuations freeze out , while the latter plays no special role in the equation of motion for the fluctuations.[fig : crossing],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to calculate the spectral index , we need to compare different @xmath61 modes . as usual ,",
    "the difference in @xmath61 is translated into a difference in the time @xmath86 when the mode @xmath61 crosses the effective hubble radius in the emergent phase .",
    "the reason why we must use the effective hubble radius crossing @xmath87 and not the crossing of the background hubble radius @xmath88 is that it is the effective hubble radius which determines the transition from the phase when fluctuations oscillate and when they are frozen out ( see figure [ fig : crossing ] for an illustration of the scales involved ) .",
    "the spectral index can be calculated as @xmath89 inserting the equations of motion , we have @xmath90 the spectral index could be extremely small .",
    "this is because we want to generate a large hierarchy of scales for which the spectrum is scale invariant .",
    "let the number of e - foldings of the effective de sitter phase be @xmath91 .",
    "then we need @xmath92 thus , the spectral index is very small given a large @xmath91 .",
    "this can be verified by inserting the above expression into ( [ eq : index ] ) .",
    "we get @xmath93 present experiments suggest that @xmath94 is a few percent . in principle , the free parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath62 can be chosen such that the power spectrum amplitude ( [ cond1 ] ) agrees with observations and the tilt reproduces the best - fit value ( [ cond2 ] ) .",
    "however , it may be difficult to fit the current data of @xmath95 because the presence of the exponential factor @xmath96 .",
    "additional mechanisms may be needed to generate a tilt of the power spectrum .",
    "similarly , for the pseudo - conformal model of @xcite , we consider the matter action @xmath97~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 is the pseudo - conformal field , which drives the background motion of the emergent cosmology .",
    "the factor @xmath99 is again the new factor which we are adding , a factor which is motivated by the khler potential or its phenomenological analog .    at the background level , the dynamics of the scale factor , and of the fields @xmath98 and @xmath4 goes as @xmath100 one can set up cosmic perturbations following what was done in the previous section .",
    "self - consistently , we postulate that the following quantities are small @xmath101 the first three quantities are analogs of conditions imposed in the galilean genesis example , corresponding to early time , sub - domination of @xmath4 , and weak coupling of fluctuations between the two degrees of freedom , respectively .",
    "the requirement of the smallness of the 4th quantity is new .",
    "it comes about as follows : if @xmath102 , then the @xmath4 field will roll down its emergent potential too quickly , and no scale invariant spectrum will be generated .    with the above assumptions , the `` small '' gauge invariant quantities for fluctuations can be constructed as @xmath103 using these definitions , the second order lagrangian can be written as @xmath104 interestingly , the pseudo - conformal case and the galilean case share the same structure of the perturbations , except for a different sign in the interaction term , which is only a different convention and thus unimportant . is still slow , it is now of the same order as the interaction term in the second order lagrangian ( the third term in equation ( [ eq : l - sigma - chi - conf ] ) ) . thus the time evolution of @xmath4 can not be neglected . in the galilean case , @xmath4 can be treated as a constant .",
    "second , in deriving the interacting term in equation ( [ eq : l - sigma - chi - conf ] ) , we have used the free field equation of motion for @xmath43 . strictly speaking ,",
    "we are not allowed to use the equation of motion in deriving the action .",
    "however , here the use of the equation of motion should be understood as a redefinition of the perturbation variables , as in the case of the field redefinition done in @xcite . ]",
    "thus we have the equations of motion in the born approximation : @xmath105 @xmath106 most naturally , the fields should start from a vacuum state .",
    "thus @xmath50 inserting the solution into the @xmath42 equation , we have @xmath107 where @xmath53 is a relative phase between the original quantum perturbations of @xmath98 and the induced perturbations .    as in the previous section , the second term dominates the @xmath54 regime .",
    "thus , the power spectrum is @xmath108 where @xmath62 is the time when the pseudo - conformal phase ends and the isocurvature field decays .",
    "again , the spectral index is small and the spectrum is nearly scale invariant .",
    "we have shown how correction terms to the effective action of the low energy fields which are expected based on supergravity or quantum gravity considerations induce a linear coupling between the fluctuations of an isocurvature field and the curvature fluctuations .",
    "thus , a scale - invariant spectrum in a spectator scalar field induces a scale - invariant curvature fluctuation spectrum .",
    "scale - invariant spectra for spectator scalar fields are induced e.g. in the galileon genesis model @xcite , in the conformal cosmology of @xcite and in the pseudo - conformal scenario of @xcite .",
    "our mechanism can be used to demonstrate that these scenarios indeed lead to a scale - invariant spectrum of curvature perturbations .",
