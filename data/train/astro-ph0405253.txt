    "the observed evolution of the space density of agn ( chokshi & turner 1992 , faber et  al .",
    "1997 , marconi & salvati 2001 ) implies that a significant fraction of luminous galaxies must host black holes , relics of past activity .",
    "indeed , it is now clear that a large fraction of hot spheroids contain a massive bh ( e.g. , magorrian et  al .",
    "1998 ; van der marel 1999 ) , and it appears that the bh mass is proportional to both the mass of the host spheroid ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) and its velocity dispersion ( ferrarese & merritt 2001 , gebhardt et  al .  2000 , merritt & ferrarese 2001 ) .",

    "the luminosity of their optical nuclei indicates that they are accreting at a low rate and/or low accretion efficiency ( chiaberge , capetti & celotti 1999 ) .",
    "they presumably sustained quasar activity in the past but at the present epoch are emitting much below their eddington limits ( l / l@xmath6@xmath7 ) .",
    "the study of the seyfert bh mass distribution provides a statistical method of investigating the interplay between accretion rate and bh growth . in order to achieve this",
    "it is necessary to directly measure the bh masses in seyfert galaxies and to compare their eddington and bolometric luminosities using the hard x - ray luminosities .",
    "similarly important will be the comparison between the bh masses found in seyfert galaxies with those of non active galaxies .",
    "however , to date , there are very few secure bh measurements or upper limits in spiral galaxies .",
    "it is therefore important to directly establish how common are bhs in spiral galaxies and whether they follow the same @xmath8-@xmath9 , @xmath8-@xmath10  correlations as elliptical galaxies .",
    "to detect and measure the masses of massive bhs requires spectral information at the highest possible angular resolution  the  sphere of influence \" of massive bhs is typically @xmath11 in radius even in the closest galaxies .",
    "nuclear absorption line spectra can be used to demonstrate the presence of a bh , but the interpretation of the data is complex because it involves stellar - dynamical models that have many degrees of freedom . in seyfert galaxies",

    "studies at _ hst _ resolution of ordinary optical emission lines from gas disks in principle provide a more widely applicable and readily interpreted way of detecting bhs ( cf .",

    "prompted by these considerations , we have undertaken a spectroscopic survey of 54 spirals using stis on the _ hubble space telescope_. our sample was extracted from a comprehensive ground - based study by axon et  al .  who obtained h@xmath12 and nii rotation curves at a seeing - limited resolution of @xmath13 , of 128 sb , sbb , sc , and sbc spiral galaxies from rc3 . by restricting ourselves to galaxies with recession velocities @xmath14km / s",
    ", we obtained a volume - limited sample of 54  spirals that are known to have nuclear gas disks and span wide ranges in bulge mass and concentration .",
    "the systemic velocity cut - off was chosen so that we can probe close to the nuclei of these galaxies , and detect even lower - mass black holes .",
    "the frequency of agn in our sample is typical of that found in other surveys of nearby spirals , with comparable numbers of weak nuclear radio sources and liners .    the observational strategy , used for all the galaxies in our sample , consisted in obtaining spectra at three parallel positions with the central slit centered on the nucleus and the flanking ones at a distance of 02 .",
    "at each slit position we obtained two spectra with the g750 m grating centered at h@xmath12 , with the second spectrum shifted along the slit by an integer number of detector pixels in order to remove cosmic - ray hits and hot pixels . the nuclear spectrum ( nuc ) was obtained with the 01 slit and no binning of the detector pixels , yielding a spatial scale of 00507/pix along the slit , a dispersion per pixel of @xmath15    and a spectral resolution of @xmath16 .",

    "the inclination of the galactic disk can be fixed to @xmath25=  20 , i.e. , the remaining free parameters can then be the fit with the procedure described earlier and we find that , in order to reproduce the observed rotation curve , a dark point mass [ supermassive bh ] of @xmath39  m@xmath2 is needed .",
