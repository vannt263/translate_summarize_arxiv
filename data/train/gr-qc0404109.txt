    "there have been two recent proposals known as the brane world scenarios ( the add scenario  @xcite and the rs scenario  @xcite ) , which attempt to solve the hierarchy problem . in these scenarios , our three - dimensional space is the 3-brane embedded in extra - dimensions . in the add scenario ,",
    "the extra - dimensions are flat and far larger compared to the planck length . accordingly",
    "the planck energy @xmath5 determined by the higher - dimensional gravitational constant @xmath6 becomes smaller than the four - dimensional planck energy @xmath7 , and it could be as low as @xmath8 . in the rs scenario , there are two branes with positive and negative tension respectively in a five - dimensional spacetime , and the bulk is filled with a negative cosmological constant @xmath9 . due to this negative @xmath9 ,",
    "the extra - dimension has a warped configuration whose effective volume for observers in the negative tension brane becomes large and this also leads to the small planck energy .",
    "if the planck energy is at @xmath10 , the properties of the black holes smaller than the scale of the extra - dimensions are totally altered .",
    "a black hole is centered on the brane but is extending out into the large extra - dimensions .",
    "hence it becomes a higher - dimensional black hole .",
    "moreover , its gravitational radius is far larger than the four - dimensional gravitational radius with the same mass .",
    "it was pointed out that the black hole production in the future - planned accelerators would be possible in this case  @xcite . in the particle collision with the energy above the planck scale ,",
    "the gravity becomes the dominant interaction and the semi - classical treatment is expected to become valid , although recently a counter - statement which is based on the generalized uncertainty principle has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the maximal impact parameter for the black hole production has the same order as the gravitational radius corresponding to the central energy , the cross section becomes sufficiently large to produce one black hole per one second at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in cern . because such black holes rapidly evaporate due to the hawking radiation and they radiate mainly on the brane  @xcite , we are able to detect the signals of the produced black holes at accelerators . the behavior of the produced black holes and the expected signals are first discussed by dimopoulos and landsberg  @xcite and thomas and giddings  @xcite , and subsequently a great amount of papers concerning the black holes at accelerators appeared .",
    "one of the necessary investigations to improve the experimental estimates would be to analyze the black hole formation in the high - energy particle collisions in higher - dimensions .",
    "as a first step , the approximation neglecting the tension of the brane and the structure of the extra - dimensions would be appropriate if we consider the case where the central energy of the particle system is far above the planck scale and the gravitational radius of the system is smaller compared to the characteristic scale of the extra - dimensions .",
    "eardley and giddings analytically investigated the apparent horizon formation in this process in the four - dimensional spacetime  @xcite .",
    "subsequently we investigated the head - on collision in higher - dimensions analytically  @xcite and the grazing collision in higher - dimensions with numerical calculations  @xcite .",
    "our results have shown that the cross section for the black hole production is somewhat larger compared to the previous estimates .",
    "the above investigations were concerning the apparent horizons with spherical topology .",
    "however it is known that the black hole horizon topology in higher - dimensions are not restricted only to spherical topology .",
    "emparan and reall generalized the weyl solution and one of the solution they derived was a five - dimensional , asymptotically - flat , static black hole with horizon topology @xmath11  @xcite , although this spacetime has a conical singularity that supports the ring horizon and prevents it from collapsing .",
    "subsequently they found the rotating version of this black hole solution without the conical singularity , which was named the black ring  @xcite .",
    "hence in the five - dimensional spacetime , the black holes are not only the generalized kerr black holes found by myers and perry  @xcite , and there is no uniqueness theorem for stationary black hole solutions analogous to the four - dimensional case ( see @xcite for static cases ) .",
    "although other solutions with non - spherical topology horizons have not been found , many such solutions are expected to exist .",
    "ida and nakao  @xcite discussed the possible horizon topology using the correlation between the power of the newtonian potential and the apparent horizon formation . according to their discussion , the apparent horizon with torus topology @xmath12 would be prohibited for all the spacetime dimension numbers @xmath1 .",
    "however various topology horizons such as @xmath0 would be allowed to form .",
    "because these black holes with non - spherical horizon topology have features that are characteristic to the higher - dimensional gravity , whether we can produce such black holes would be an interesting theme . in this paper",
    ", we would like to analyze the formation of the black ring horizon ( i.e. the horizon with topology @xmath0 ) in particle systems .    whether the black ring can become the final state depends on its stability .",
    "there are many evidences that the black rings are unstable .",
    "first , if the angular momentum of the black ring is sufficiently large ( i.e. the parameter @xmath13 in @xcite is close to zero ) , the gregory - laflamme instability  @xcite occurs because the radius of the ring around @xmath14 becomes small while the radius around @xmath15 becomes large  @xcite .",
    "next , due to the fact that the sequence of the black ring solution has the minimum value of the angular momentum normalized by an appropriate power of the mass , the black ring would be unstable around this configuration because if one put some mass into the black ring , the mass would increase and the angular momentum would not change and thus there is no black ring solution that corresponds to this situation  @xcite .",
    "finally , the rotating matter with ring configuration is not stable in the higher - dimensional newtonian gravity  @xcite .",
    "if one write the effective potential as a function of the ring radius , there is only one unstable point and is no stable point for @xmath16 , and there is only a marginally stable configuration for @xmath17 .",
    "all these situations support the instability of the black rings for all the parameter range , although the explicit analysis of the black ring perturbation has not been done . however , even if we admit the instability of the black ring , the black ring might form and exist until it changes to the other final state .",
    "ida , oda , and park  @xcite discussed how the black ring evolves if it forms in a high - energy two - particle system and if it traps almost all the energy and the angular momentum of the system using the newtonian approximation . according to their discussion , such a black ring increases its radius around @xmath15 and expands until the gregory - laflamme instability occurs .",
    "if it really happens , we might be able to observe some signals from the black rings in accelerators .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the black ring formation in @xmath2-particle systems for @xmath18 , because intuitively the black rings would be easier to form in the system with more particles .",
    "we would like to derive the condition for the black ring formation in terms of the particle number @xmath2 and the location of particles .",
    "we analyze two kinds of system : the high - energy particle system which we previously used in @xcite and the @xmath2-body black hole initial data .",
    "first we will begin with the analysis of the high - energy particle systems .",
    "the metric of the spacetime with one high - energy particle has been written down by aichelburg and sexl  @xcite by boosting the schwarzschild black hole to the speed of light fixing the energy .",
    "the resulting spacetime is a massless point particle accompanied by a gravitational shock wave which distributes in the transverse direction of motion .",
    "the high - energy two - particle system can be introduced by combining two shock waves  @xcite . in our previous paper",
    "@xcite , we analyzed the apparent horizon on the union of two incoming shock waves ( i.e. at the instant of collision ) and showed that the black hole horizon ( i.e. the horizon with topology @xmath19 ) forms .",
    "in this paper , we will introduce the equation for the black ring horizon on this slice .",
    "unfortunately , we can easily show that there is no solution of the black ring horizon on this spacetime slice . intuitively , it is natural to expect that the black ring would form in a high - energy @xmath2-particle system if @xmath2 is sufficiently large .",
    "but also in the @xmath2-particle system , we can show that there is no black ring horizon on the union of @xmath2 incoming shock waves .",
    "these results do nt mean that the black ring can not form in high - energy particle systems : they just mean that there is no black ring horizon at the instant of collision and there remains the possibility of its formation after the collision of the shocks . to obtain the rigorous answer",
    ", we should analyze the spacetime slice after the collision of the shocks .",
    "however , this would be extremely difficult because the shocks nonlinearly interact after the collision and no one has succeeded to calculate the metric after the collision with the impact parameter .",
    "instead , we next analyze the more simplified situation , the conformally - flat momentarily - static ( i.e. time - symmetric ) @xmath2-black - hole initial data originally introduced by brill and lindquist in the four - dimensional case  @xcite .",
    "this initial data also can be regarded as a @xmath2-particle system because it is the solution of the hamiltonian constraint of the einstein equation with @xmath20-function sources .",
    "although this setting might be too simplified especially because each particle is not moving , this initial data provides the @xmath2 particles that are interacting each other and we would be able to obtain a lot of implications about the black ring formation in higher - dimensions .",
    "we numerically solve the apparent horizon with @xmath0 topology that surrounds all the particles , and derive the minimum number @xmath21 that is necessary for the black ring formation for each spacetime dimension number @xmath1 . using these results",
    ", we would like to discuss the feature of the black ring formation in higher - dimensions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we investigate the high - energy particle system and show that the black ring horizon does not exist at the instant of collision . in sec .",
    "iii , we analyze the momentarily - static @xmath2-black - hole system .",
    "we explain the numerical methods of finding apparent horizons with @xmath0 and @xmath19 topology , and show the numerical results .",
    "we also provide a plausible physical interpretation for our results and discuss the validity of ida and nakao s conjecture  @xcite for the apparent horizon formation in higher - dimensions .",
    "iv is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "the brief discussion concerning the probable methods of black ring production in accelerators is also included .",
    "in this section , we investigate the existence of the black ring horizon in the high - energy @xmath2-particle system .",
    "first we analyze the two - particle system , in which we previously investigated the black hole formation  @xcite .",
    "the set up of the system is as follows . to obtain the metric of a high - energy one - particle system , we boost the @xmath1-dimensional schwarzschild solution to the speed of light .",
    "the schwarzschild metric is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the line element and the @xmath25-area of the @xmath25-dimensional unit sphere respectively , and the horizon is located at @xmath26 where @xmath27 by boosting this metric in @xmath28-direction and taking a lightlike limit fixing the energy @xmath29 , we obtain the aichelburg - sexl metric  @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath33 depends only on the transverse radius @xmath34 and takes the form @xmath35 the metric is flat except @xmath36 and the @xmath20 function in eq .",
    "indicates that there is a gravitational shock wave propagating in the flat spacetime at the speed of light .",
    "mathematically , the origin of this @xmath20 function is due to the fact that the two flat - spacetime coordinate systems @xmath37 are discontinuously connected at @xmath36 .",
    "the continuous coordinate system @xmath38 can be introduced by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the heaviside step function . in this coordinate system ,",
    "the metric is represented without the @xmath20 function : @xmath41 where @xmath42 we can superpose two solutions to obtain the exact geometry outside the future light cone of the collision of the shocks : @xmath43 where @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the point in the @xmath25-space @xmath46 and @xmath47 are defined as @xmath48 where @xmath49 denote the locations of the incoming particles in this subspace and we set @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the impact parameter .",
    "this system was originally introduced by death and payne in the four - dimensional case  @xcite .",
    "eardley and giddings  @xcite derived the equation of the apparent horizon on the union of the incoming shock waves , i.e. , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we briefly review this method because it is useful also for the black ring horizon case .",
    "they assumed that the horizon is given by the union of @xmath25-surfaces @xmath54 in @xmath52 and @xmath55 in @xmath53 that are given by @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "the surfaces @xmath58 are combined at @xmath59-surface @xmath60 in @xmath61 . because there is a symmetry in this system , we have only to consider the @xmath54 surface .",
    "although the function @xmath62 diverges at @xmath63 , the surface is continuous at that point if one see in the @xmath37 coordinate . in this coordinate , the surface @xmath54 is located at @xmath64 where @xmath65 is satisfied on @xmath66 .",
    "the outgoing null normal for this surface is given by @xmath67 and the condition for zero expansion becomes @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes the flat space laplacian in the @xmath70 coordinate . to find the black hole horizon , one should calculate the continuous and smooth solution of eq .",
    "with two boundary conditions imposed at @xmath60 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "now we consider whether the black ring horizon with @xmath71 exists on the same slice . due to this horizon topology ,",
    "the location of the horizon @xmath54 becomes a double - valued function of @xmath70 .",
    "we divide @xmath54 into two parts denoted by @xmath72 where we impose @xmath73 .",
    "using the symmetries of this system , @xmath74 and @xmath75 depends only on @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the shape of the ring horizon that we expect to exist is shown in fig .",
    "[ laplace2 ] .",
    "@xmath78 and @xmath79 are combined at a @xmath59-surface @xmath80 , where the gradient of @xmath74 and @xmath75 diverges .",
    "there are two boundaries @xmath81 and @xmath82 , where we should impose boundary conditions .",
    "the null normal of the surface @xmath79 becomes @xmath83 and clearly @xmath79 has zero expansion for all @xmath75 .",
    "the null normal of @xmath78 and the equation for zero expansion coincide with eq .   and",
    "eq .   respectively if we put @xmath84 .",
    "however , we can easily show the non - existence of the solution @xmath85 that satisfies the above conditions . assuming the existence of the solution , the location of @xmath80 is expressed as @xmath86",
    "because the surface @xmath54 should be smooth , the surface @xmath78 is well - approximated by @xmath87 in the neighborhood of the @xmath59-surface @xmath80 with some function @xmath88 .",
    "calculating @xmath89 , we obtain @xmath90 if we take a limit @xmath91 , the value of @xmath92 diverges for any choice of @xmath88 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 , and this shows that the surface like fig .  [ laplace2 ] can not satisfy the laplace equation .",
    "this result is due to the fact that if there is a @xmath59-dimensional singularity of the @xmath25-dimensional laplace equation , both values of the solution and its gradient should be finite in the neighborhood of the singularity .",
    "although we have not considered the boundary conditions in this discussion , this is sufficient for the proof of the non - existence of the solution because satisfying eq .   is a necessary condition and eq .",
    "shows that the necessary condition can not be satisfied .",
    "hence the black ring horizon does not exist on the union of two incoming shock waves , although the black hole horizon can be calculated  @xcite .    intuitively , it would be obvious that the black ring forms in a @xmath2-particle system for large @xmath2 .",
    "we can write down the metric of the high - energy @xmath2-particle system outside the future light cone of the shock collisions similarly to the two - particle case",
    ". however , one can easily see that the black ring horizon does not exist on the union of @xmath2 incoming shocks , simply because the horizon equation is the @xmath25-laplace equation also in this system and it does not allow the divergence of the gradient at the @xmath59-singularity . hence we can not find the ring horizon even in the @xmath2-particle system . however , these results just show that the ring horizon does not exist at the instant of collision and it might form after the collision . to obtain the answer , we should investigate the spacetime slice after the collision of the shocks .",
    "this analysis is rather difficult because the shocks nonlinearly interact each other after the collision and no one has calculated the metric after the collision . hence at this point , we do nt understand anything about the black ring formation in particle systems . to obtain some implications",
    ", we consider a rather simplified situation in the next section : the momentarily - static @xmath2-black - hole initial data .",
    "as we mentioned in previous sections , we consider the momentarily - static @xmath2-black - hole initial data as a simplified model that we can analyze .",
    "this initial data provides @xmath2-particles that are interacting each other , although each particle is not moving . by analyzing the formation of the black ring horizon in this system , we are able to understand the feature of the black ring formation in @xmath2-particle systems in higher - dimensions .",
    "let @xmath95 be the @xmath96-dimensional space with the metric @xmath97 and the extrinsic curvature @xmath98 .",
    "we assume the conformally - flat initial data of which metric is @xmath99 where @xmath45 denotes the location in the flat space and each @xmath100-sphere is spanned by a @xmath101 coordinate .",

    "the solution of @xmath18 is the @xmath2 einstein - rosen bridges originally introduced by brill and lindquist  @xcite .",
    "each @xmath108 corresponds to the asymptotically flat region beyond the einstein - rosen bridge .",
    "we locate the @xmath2 point sources at @xmath2 vertexes of a regular polygon that is inscribed in a circle with the radius @xmath111 .",
    "more precisely , we set each @xmath108 as @xmath112 in the @xmath113 coordinate . as we see from the fact that eq .",

    "note that the parameters that specify the initial data are the spacetime dimension number @xmath1 , the particle number @xmath2 , and the parameter @xmath111 to locate the particles in eq .  .",
    "now we explain the methods of finding apparent horizons . because this space is time - symmetric , the equation for the apparent horizon is @xmath114 where @xmath115 stands for the expansion of outgoing null geodesic congruence",

    "@xcite , we discussed the validity of this conjecture in the high - energy two - particle system and found that this conjecture provides a good condition for the black hole production .    using our results in this paper ,",
    "we discuss whether this conjecture gives the condition for the black ring formation in @xmath2-particle systems . in our opinion , this conjecture has a possibility to provide the condition for the existence of horizons with various topology if we evaluate the @xmath59-volume appropriately . here , we assume that the condition of the black hole formation is given by @xmath59-volume @xmath175 of a surface with @xmath176 topology , and that the condition of the black ring formation is given by @xmath59-volume @xmath177 of a surface with @xmath71 topology .",

    "there is the minimal value @xmath191 and the maximal value @xmath192 such that the black ring horizon exists only in the range @xmath193 . for the black ring formation",
    ", the distance between the neighboring particles should be small , while the space at the center between all the particles should be large .",
    "these lead to the existence of @xmath191 and @xmath192 . for each @xmath1",
    ", there is the minimum particle number @xmath21 that is necessary for the ring apparent horizon formation .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ minimum_n ] .",
    "this minimum number @xmath21 becomes small and approaches to three for large @xmath1 .",
    "if we compare fixing @xmath2 , the parameter range @xmath111 of the black ring formation becomes larger as @xmath1 increases .",
    "these results show that the black ring formation becomes easier for larger dimension number @xmath1 . because there is a plausible interpretation for our results",
    ", we expect that these features would be valid also in the high - energy particle system .",
    "we calculated hawking s quasi - local mass on the horizons to understand the energy trapped by the horizon . hawking s quasi - local mass on the apparent horizon @xmath194 ( the apparent horizon mass )",
    "is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath111 that is discontinuous at @xmath195 where the black hole horizon disappears .",
    "the amount of the energy trapped inside the ring horizon is always greater than 75% for the @xmath196 cases , which is rather a large value .",
    "we do nt consider that so much energy can be trapped in the case of the black ring horizon in the high - energy particle system . in our previous paper  @xcite",
    ", we calculated the apparent horizon mass of the black hole horizon that is formed in the high - energy two - particle grazing collision .",
    "the energy trapped by the horizon is quite small if @xmath1 is large and the impact parameter is close to its maximal value , and we discussed that many black holes with small mass would be produced in high - energy particle systems , although further investigations of the gravitational radiation after the collision would be necessary to obtain the rigorous answer . hence we consider that the trapped energy of the black ring might be small also in the high - energy @xmath2-particle system .",
    "however we expect that the energy trapped by the black ring would be always smaller than that trapped by the black hole if we compare fixing @xmath2 and @xmath1 also in the high - energy @xmath2-particle system .    from these results",
    ", we expect that the production of the black rings using systems with many particles would be possible , although it is difficult for the @xmath17 case .",
    "@xmath3 would be sufficient for this purpose if @xmath1 is equal to or larger than seven .",
    "we should mention that the motion of each particle is important to observe the signals from the black rings in colliders .",
    "for example , if each particle has a velocity such that the ring radius decreases , the system would rapidly collapses to a black hole and we would not be able to detect the signals of the black ring even if the ring horizon momentarily forms . to produce the black ring with a long lifetime , each particle should have a velocity in the @xmath197 direction in the coordinate system used in sec .",
    "if we take it into account , the ordinary colliders are not appropriate for the black ring formation .",
    "a linear collider with four arms , for example , would be able to produce the black rings with a small probability .",
    "our remaining problem is as follows .",
    "although we expect that the basic feature of the results in the brill - lindquist initial data would not be changed in the high - energy particle system , there is a possibility that the momentums of particles have a large effect on the existence of the horizon as we have shown in our previous paper in two - black - hole systems in four - dimensions  @xcite . to clarify this point",
    ", we should investigate the case where each particle has a momentum in the @xmath197 direction . for this purpose ,",
    "bowen and york s method  @xcite is useful . using this method",
    ", one can calculate the conformally - flat initial data of multi - black holes with momentums .",
    "the extrinsic curvature is given analytically , and one should solve the conformal factor numerically .",
    "although this method was proposed in the four - dimensional case , the extension to the higher - dimensional cases has been done by shibata  @xcite . using this method , we are able to calculate the initial data of moving particles and understand the effect of motion on the ring horizon formation .",
    "next , we would like to investigate the remaining possibility to produce the black rings in two - particle systems .",
    "although it seems that the black ring would not form in the two - point - particle system from the results in this paper , it might be possible if we consider the deformed particles .",
    "for example , if we regard the incoming particle as the fundamental string , the classical model for the gravitational field would be provided by a segmental source .",
    "hence in the high - energy collision of two - strings , there is a possibility of the black ring formation .",
    "another example uses the instability of the higher - dimensional kerr black holes .",
    "recently emparan and myers have shown that the ultra - spinning kerr black holes in higher - dimensions are unstable  @xcite . hence ,",
    "if these ultra - spinning kerr black holes can be produced in the high - energy two - particle collisions , they would deform due to this instability .",
    "subsequently two deformed black holes might collide each other and form the black ring . to confirm this scenario",
    ", we should investigate whether the production of the ultra - spinning black holes is possible in the high - energy two - particle system .",
    "this requires the investigation of the balding phase ( i.e. the evolution after the particle collision ) and the determination of the amount of energy and angular momentum that is radiated away .",
    "we would like to thank masaru shibata , ken - ichi nakao and daisuke ida for helpful discussions .",
    "we are also in thank of tetsuya shiromizu s helpful comments on the black ring formation in the system of two deformed particles .",
    "the work of h. y. is supported in part by a grant - in - aid from nagoya university 21st century coe program ( orium ) .",
