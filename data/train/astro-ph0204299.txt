    "a significant problem in accretion disk theory is the nature of anomalous viscosity . in order for accretion to occur",
    ", angular momentum must be transported outward .",
    "the central problem in astrophysical accretion disks is that observed accretion rates can not be due to ordinary molecular viscosity .",
    "a robust anomalous angular momentum transport mechanism must operate in accretion disks .    in 1991 ,",
    "the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) , discovered by @xcite and @xcite , was reintroduced as a mechanism for excitation and sustaining mhd turbulence in a magnetized but rayleigh - stable fluid by @xcite . since then",
    ", many numerical and analytic studies of the mri have been performed under varying conditions @xcite . nevertheless , amidst all the theoretical attention granted to the mri , it has never been demonstrated in the laboratory . in light of this fact an @xmath1 dynamo experiment at the new mexico institute of mining and technology",
    "provides a unique opportunity to study the mri in a rotating metal annulus using liquid sodium . in this paper , a local stability analysis",
    "is performed and the results are compared with theoretical analysis from a similar proposed experiment at the princeton plasma physics laboratory @xcite .",
    "varying aspects of the experiments are discussed with stable and unstable regions identified in terms of magnetic field strength and shear flow .",
    "in addition the number of unstable modes and the prandtl number further define the parameter space .",
    "if the number of unstable modes is large compared to unity , then there exists the possibility of observing turbulence generated by the mri .",
    "finally we investigate the instability boundary when fluid turbulence is injected as for example through the ekman layer flow .",
    "the new mexico @xmath0 dynamo ( nmd ) experiment is a collaboration between the new mexico institute of mining and technology and los alamos national laboratory @xcite .",
    "the experiment is designed to create an astrophysical dynamo , the @xmath2-dynamo , in a rapidly rotating laboratory system .",
    "the apparatus consists of two coaxial cylinders ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , rotating at different angular velocities and therefore creating couette flow in the annular volume .",
    "liquid sodium fills the volume between the cylinders and the end walls .",
    "solid plates attached to and co - rotating with the outer cylinder with an angular velocity , @xmath3 define the end walls .",
    "( in addition , for the dynamo experiment , an external source of helicity is supplied , driven plumes , but this is not part of the mri experiment . )",
    "the schematic of the flow field , ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , places particular emphasis on the primary diagnostic of multiple , 3-axis , magnetic field hall effect detectors ( sensitivity : @xmath4 to @xmath5 ) located in aerodynamically shaped probes within the rotating conducting fluid .",
    "we expect that the radial perturbations from the mri and their azimuthally sheared result will produce a fluctuating @xmath6 and @xmath7 field from an original imposed static @xmath8 field through mri growth .",
    "these fluctuating fields are the result of the linear and non - linear growth of the various mri modes transformed by the difference of the sheared couette flow at a given radius and the probe angular velocity , @xmath3 , of the outer cylinder .",
    "a significant difficulty will be the observation of the linear growth of any particular mri mode because the time constant for establishing the initial axial field within the conducting liquid sodium will be long , @xmath9 , compared to the expected growth rate , @xmath10 , of the instabilities as derived in this paper .",
    "we therefore expect to observe primarily the near steady state of the non - linear limit of various modes , but the sequential linear phases may be observed during the comparatively slow rise of the field . if the applied field or flux is amplified by the mri such as a dynamo , then we expect to see fluctuating fields significantly greater than the applied field .",
    "in addition since the inner and outer cylinders are driven separately , the relative torque as a function of the applied magnetic field becomes an integral diagnostic of the non - linear limits of the instability growth .    by driving the inner cylinder and applying a variable brake with a corresponding torque measurement to the outer cylinder",
    "one can explore the full range of couette velocity profiles including the marginal couette flow hydrodynamic stability condition discussed next .",
    "this condition of maximum or marginal stable couette profile can be established in the experiment precisely by gear ratios and so the degree of turbulence measured by the torque can be explored at the stability boundary .",
    "in addition the pressure will be measured at five radii and compared to the pressure distributions expected of the various couette profiles .",
    "a finite torque measurement can be interpreted in terms of turbulence existing between the two cylinders .",
    "no turbulence or perfectly laminar flow will exert a torque of the order @xmath11 , @xmath12 the fluid reynolds number where @xmath13 , compared to a turbulent torque , @xmath14 , if the ekman layer circulation leads to the weak turbulence that we discuss later .",
    "this same possible weak turbulence can also be measured by introducing a very weak field , @xmath15 , small enough so as not to cause the growth of mri in resistive liquid but large enough so that an unstable flow or weakly turbulent flow can be measured as fluctuations in @xmath6 and @xmath7 with the hall effect probes . therefore the fluid flow conditions can be fully explored before the application of magnetic fields designed to create the mri .",
    "when the mri does take place , then the instability can be recognized as a departure from the previously measured initial fluid state .",
    "it is critical to have large shear rates in order to observe the maximum growth rates of the mri .",
    "however , excessive shear will hydrodynamically destabilize the flow by the kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "let us consider a couette flow profile in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "take @xmath16 as the radial , azimuthal and axial directions respectively .",
    "the radial distribution of angular velocity of the flow , @xmath17 , is given by @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the inner(outer ) radii and angular velocities .",
    "in the limit of infinitely large hydrodynamic reynolds number , @xmath21 , the stability condition for couette flow is given by @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to maximize the shear flow within the apparatus , the nmd experiment has been designed such that @xmath25 and @xmath26 = 4 , guaranteeing that @xmath22 = @xmath24 .",
    "in addition to stability constraints , stress limitations in the experiment require that an upper limit of @xmath27 be placed on the frequency of rotation of the outer cylinder .",
    "of course lower rotation rate can be used in both nmd experiment and princeton plasma physics laboratory ( pppl ) experiment , but it is assumed for this analysis that the highest rates are of greatest scientific interest .    the assumption of stable couette flow implies a laminar flow with no turbulence . on the other hand the initial acceleration of the fluid to the final state of couette flow from an alternate initial",
    "state implies a transient enhanced torque , because , just as in the accretion disk , the laminar friction is too small .",
    "however , in the experimental apparatus , the transient , couette flow profile is helmholtz unstable so that turbulence is a natural and expected result of the `` spin - up '' of the flow .",
    "on the other hand the ekman flow creates a relative torque between @xmath28 and @xmath3 that we expect to be balanced by a weak turbulence as observed by @xcite and analogous to the spin - up turbulence . this turbulence may also influence the stability conditions but primarily the ability to distinguish turbulence caused by the mri from the hydrodynamic turbulence caused by the ekman layer .",
    "we therefore analyze the mri stability conditions as a function of hydrodynamic turbulence preexisting in the liquid and therefore of the prandtl number . at large enough levels of turbulence , the effective electrical resistivity can also be increased and therefore decrease the magnetic reynolds number , @xmath29 , and therefore influence the conditions of excitation of the mri .    in comparison to the new mexico dynamo experiment ,",
    "a similar experiment at the princeton plasma physics laboratory has been proposed to look for the mri in a rotating liquid metal annulus @xcite .",
    "the pppl experiment utilizes liquid gallium , an easy to handle metal with properties similar to liquid sodium ( see table  1 ) .",

    "one needs to investigate the time evolution of perturbations to this equilibrium state governed by the linearization of system of equations ( [ b1])([b4 ] ) .",
    "a similar analysis of perturbations was performed by @xcite , who showed that local wkb approximation gives results for growth rates of instability , which are close to the growth rates obtained by the solving full boundary value problem in radial direction . as it is especially stressed by @xcite and @xcite , wkb local analysis leads to a good approximation to the growth rates even in the case of the scale of perturbations being equal to or comparable to the sizes of the vessel .",

    "the mri occurs only when the second term inside the square root of ( [ sol ] ) is negative , i.e. , @xmath102 where @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",

    "though magnetic diffusion diminishes the mri , the branch remains unstable if the condition @xmath114 is satisfied .",
    "notice however , that even if the magnetic diffusivity is high , a weak magnetic field is capable of generating the mri .",
    "next , let us consider the hydrodynamical limit(@xmath115 ) with arbitrary couette flow profiles , ( @xmath116 ) . in this case , @xmath117 in general and we have to go back to eq .",
    "( [ dis ] ) for deriving solutions .",
    "two trivial solutions are @xmath118 , corresponding to the electromagnetic branch and the second is given by @xmath119 which is the hydrodynamical branch .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]         figure  [ fig7 ] shows the dependence of the mri growth rate with the turbulent @xmath120 as a function of an axial magnetic field strength and the prandtl number for the most unstable modes in both experiments . in sodium experiment ,",
    "higher @xmath121 modes are also unstable .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the growth rate for @xmath122 mode .",

    "[ fig4]b and  [ fig51]b above ) , and mri exists only in the region @xmath123 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) .",
    "however , the sodium experiment with maximum shear , @xmath99 , can be destabilized with already very weak magnetic field , in the range of @xmath124 .    in conclusion ,",
    "the presence of ekman layers is significant for the determining of the power necessary to sustain the differential rotation in the apparatus but has a negligible effect on the condition of the excitation of the mri as it has been already mentioned briefly in ji et al .",
    "however , the turbulence excited due to the presence of ekman layers may interfere with our measurements of perturbations of magnetic field excited by the mri .",
    "therefore , the presence of weak turbulent perturbations due to ekman layers seems unavoidable whenever one observes the excitation of the mri .",
    "it also seems unlikely that the imposed magnetic field in both sodium and gallium experiments can significantly exceed a value of a few thousands gauss .",
    "the characteristic amplitude of the perturbations of the magnetic field due to the ekman layer turbulence is @xmath125 .",
    "the typical value of such perturbed magnetic fields is of order of 1  % of the applied field ( see table  1 for @xmath57 ) , thus , limiting the possible mri measurements of growing fields to more than 1  % of the initial magnetic field .",
    "there are several aspects of each experiment that warrant discussion . the first deals with the analysis performed for both experiments .",
    "in this paper we used the full dispersion relation which depended not only on an azimuthal magnetic field but also has all terms proportional to @xmath96 retained .",
    "this corresponds to the geometrical effect of the curvature from the cylindrical geometry .",
    "only when one neglects all @xmath96 terms in the dispersion relation does one obtain the results of @xcite .",
    "this allows us to consider many different magnetic field configurations , some of which will be suitable for studying the mri .",
    "nevertheless , even with these significant problems and differences , it should be noted that both the nmd and pppl experiments have an excellent chance of observing the mri in the laboratory .",
    "both experiments obtain very high growth rates under varying conditions yielding a flexible set of opportunities .",
    "finally we note that the effect of an azimuthal magnetic field and an analysis of nonaxisymmetric modes are still open problems .",
    "@xcite showed that the local dispersion analysis in shear flow may fail even for the qualitative estimation of growth rates .",
    "the eigenmode analysis for nonaxisymmetric modes is necessary for further understanding of the mri instability in the nmd experiment .",
    "we are now developing the shooting method code for solving eqs .",
    "( [ b1])-([b4 ] ) simultaneously",
    ". spatial dependence of the radial wavenumber and azimuthal magnetic field dependence will be analyzed .",
    "k.n . and s.a.c .",
    "are particularly indebted to hui li of los alamos national laboratory for pointing out the relevance of the mri to the nmd experiment and encouraging the present work .",
