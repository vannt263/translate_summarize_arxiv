    "the description of the static phase of granular matter , much like its dynamical phases , is of significant current interest .",
    "some studies focus on constitutive relations in order to describe the stress distribution in these materials whereas other investigations probe their microscopic characteristics , such as the nature of the force distributions and correlations .",
    "static and quasi - static properties of granular materials are commonly modeled by engineers using elasto - plastic  @xcite and hypoplastic  @xcite models .",
    "other types of models have been put forward ( mostly ) by physicists .",
    "some of these models comprise hyperbolic partial differential equations for the stress transmission through a granular material  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast with the elliptic , non - propagating nature of the classical equations of static elasticity .",
    "it seems that this dichotomy in the modeling of granular statics started  @xcite in the context of the interpretation of experiments performed on conical piles  @xcite , where a pressure dip below the apex of the pile has been observed ( the presence or absence of such a dip in conical piles and in wedges was found to depend on the construction method  @xcite ) .    in order to obtain insights into this problem",
    "it is convenient to consider the simpler geometry of a granular rectangular layer ( or slab ) resting on a solid support  @xcite , not the least since this class of systems is well researched experimentally  @xcite .",
    "much like in the case of piles , the cited and other experiments seem to be sending mixed messages concerning the ` correct ' description of stress transmission in granular slabs , as some render support to the elliptic descriptions whereas others are compatible with hyperbolic models . when the response to the application of an external force is linear in the force ( for sufficiently small forces ) , the problem is tantamount to the study of the green s function of the system  @xcite .",
    "the present article is devoted to a detailed study of the response of two - dimensional vertical slabs comprising polydisperse frictional disks subject to gravity and a localized , compressive external load applied at the top of the slab ; it expands upon the results of  @xcite in both content and detail .    the dependence of the response on the magnitude of the external force as well as the interaction parameters and degree of disorder ( or polydispersity ) is investigated .",
    "the results suggest a resolution of the above mentioned controversy as well as the seemingly mutually incompatible experimental results .",
    "first , noticing that strongly anisotropic elasticity can exhibit hyperbolic - like features ( see more below ) it is convenient to consider the response within the framework of elasticity . note that it is not claimed that the process leading to a given state is elastic ( often it is not ) but rather that the excess stress field induced by an external force in a given ( `` prestressed '' ) static state can be described by the equations of elasticity and often even by linear isotropic elasticity ( for an isotropic reference configuration ) , even in the presence of friction ( see also the recent elastic model reviewed in  @xcite ) . more specifically , large systems subject to `` small '' applied forces ( which is likely to be the case in many engineering applications ) , can be described by isotropic elasticity except in the near vicinity of the point of application of the force ( where one expects strong induced anisotropy and irreversible rearrangements ) . sufficiently far from the point of application",
    "the external force leads to practically no sliding or rearrangement of the grains .",
    "the latter events are rarer the larger the friction and therefore , as shown below , the linearity and isotropy of the response are _ enhanced _ by friction .",
    "nonlinear / irreversible effects such as changes in the contact network and frictional sliding can naturally give rise to large _",
    "anisotropy _ , yielding hyperbolic - like response ( as already suggested in  @xcite ) . in relatively small systems subject to sufficiently large forces , as in some experiments  @xcite",
    ", the size of the nonlinear and anisotropic domain induced by the external forcing can be comparable to the system s size , hence the stress transmission in such systems can be well described by hyperbolic or near - hyperbolic ( see below ) equations .",
    "similar qualitative behavior is observed in both ordered ( lattice ) and disordered ( polydisperse ) configurations , the main difference being the range of magnitudes of external forces for which one observes elastic response .",
    "note that qualitatively similar results were obtained in a study of the _ displacement _ response rather than stress  @xcite , using a similar numerical simulation .",
    "this study focused on the effect of the mean coordination number , controlled by the particle stiffness , rather than the effects of the frictional properties and the disorder which are the focus of the present work .",
    "interestingly , an approach using a force network ensemble  @xcite also seems to yield qualitatively similar results concerning the effect of friction , although a full physical interpretation of this approach is still lacking .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents an outline of the elliptic ( elastic ) and hyperbolic descriptions of static granular matter and a comparison between the two .",
    "results of some relevant experiments are reviewed in the same context .",
    "[ sec : sim ] provides a description of the simulation method .",
    "[ sec : nofriction ] reports the results obtained for frictionless systems , and the subsequent sections describe more realistic simulations incorporating friction ( sec .",
    "[ sec : friction ] ) and disorder ( polydisperse systems , sec .",
    "[ sec : disorder ] ) .",
    "the results of the simulations and their analysis enable the interpretation of the findings in different experiments : this comprises the content of sec .",
    "[ sec : interpretation ] .",
    "viii offers a brief summary of the main results .",
    "as mentioned , there are two main classes of models that have been proposed for the description of the response of granular assemblies . broadly known as the `` elliptic '' and `` hyperbolic '' descriptions , their predictions differ both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "these respective predictions for the case of the response ( excess pressure on the floor due to the external force , i.e. , the pressure due to gravity in the otherwise unforced system is subtracted ) to the application of an external vertical force at the center top of a slab are schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : elliptic+hyperbolic ] .",
    "the elliptic case is represented here by the results of _ isotropic _ elasticity  @xcite . in this case , a single peaked response on the floor is expected [ fig .",
    "[ fig : elliptic ] ] , its width being proportional to the depth ( or height ) of the slab .",
    "the shape of the peak is determined by the equations of elasticity , and depends on the boundary conditions at the floor  @xcite ( e.g. , its rigidity and roughness ) .",
    "in contrast , hyperbolic descriptions  @xcite dictate that the stress propagates along characteristic directions , and two peaks are expected in 2d ( a ring in 3d ) , their widths determined by diffusive broadening due to disorder  @xcite and ( consequently ) proportional to the square root of the depth of the slab .",
    "this type of description has been shown  @xcite to apply to ( frictionless ) isostatic systems  @xcite , i.e. , systems in which newton s first and third laws ( and the boundary conditions ) provide a number of equations that equals the number of unknowns ( force components ) thereby enabling the determination of the forces from these laws ; it turns out these conditions determine an average coordination number for the particle contacts and that the latter is the minimum required to maintain the stability of the packing .",
    "this notion can not be directly extended to hyperstatic systems ( i.e. , with a higher coordination number ) .",
    "the isostatic case is a marginally stable configuration , which may correspond to a plastic material which is everywhere at incipient yield ( for which classical plasticity results in hyperbolic equations  @xcite ) .",
    "we also note that recent models based on the description of the stress in terms of propagating force chains which may split and merge  @xcite have been shown to correspond to elastic - like equations at large scales  @xcite ; a physical interpretation of the fields satisfying these equations is still lacking .",
    "it is important to note that , as already mentioned in  @xcite , elastic systems can exhibit hyperbolic - like behavior . in  @xcite",
    ", we used a simple 2d model in order to demonstrate this property , i.e. , a triangular lattice of harmonic springs in which the spring constant for the horizontal springs , @xmath0 , is different from that of the oblique ones , @xmath1 .",
    "this model corresponds ( in the continuum limit ) to an anisotropic elastic system ( the response of an anisotropic elastic infinite half - plane ( 2d ) with uniaxial symmetry has been analyzed in detail in  @xcite ) .",
    "the qualitative nature of the response depends on the degree of anisotropy : it is single peaked for values of @xmath2 near 1 ( @xmath3 corresponds to an isotropic system ) .",
    "the response is narrower than the isotropic one for @xmath4 and wider for @xmath5 . for sufficiently large values of @xmath2 ,",
    "the response becomes double peaked , i.e. , in qualitative agreement with the predictions of the hyperbolic models .",
    "however , the equations of anisotropic elasticity are elliptic , except in the extreme anisotropic limit @xmath6 in which the equations do become hyperbolic .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the limit @xmath7 corresponds to the absence of horizontal springs , and is therefore _ isostatic_.",
    "this limit is similar to the case of a square ( or cubic ) lattice of springs which ( to linear order in the displacement ) has no shear rigidity along the lattice directions  @xcite .",
    "although this anisotropic model seems quite artificial , we show below that anisotropy arises quite naturally in more realistic descriptions of granular materials .",
    "this section reviews some of the experiments in which the response of a granular slab to a localized force was measured .    in the experiments described in  @xcite ,",
    "a localized vertical force was applied to a two - dimensional ( 2d ) packing of photoelastic particles .",
    "recall that stressed photoelastic solids viewed through cross - polarizers exhibit fringes whose density is proportional to the difference between the two principal values of the internal particle stress  @xcite . in the described experiment the applied forces had to be sufficiently large in order to observe the fringes ; in practice forces that were about 150 times the particle weight were used .",
    "the stress is concentrated at the interparticle contacts .",
    "post - processing techniques were used to extract the magnitudes of the interparticle forces from the experimental images  @xcite .",
    "force chains were prominent in all studied realizations .",
    "three different types of packings were studied in  @xcite .",
    "the most ordered was that of a triangular lattice of nominally monodisperse ( equal ) disks ; less order was found in a packing of bidisperse disks ( two different sizes ) , and a packing of pentagonally shaped particles was the most disordered of the three .",
    "the images from 50 configurations were averaged  @xcite for each type of packing .",
    "the force profiles as a function of the horizontal ( orthogonal to gravity ) coordinate were plotted for different depths in each of the slabs  @xcite .",
    "these profiles exhibited strong dependence on the particle shapes : the ordered lattice of monodisperse disks exhibited two prominent `` force chains '' along the lattice directions ( @xmath8 with respect to the horizontal ) , a result which appears to be consistent with a hyperbolic model of propagating forces ( note , however , that a vertical force chain can be observed as well , and it is not anticipated by these models ) .",
    "as the disorder is increased , the force chains `` fade out '' , and for the random configuration of pentagonal particles in 2d the measured force profile possessed a single peak , the width of which varied linearly in the depth ; the latter result is compatible with the predictions of elasticity . it was proposed that granular materials may experience a crossover from a hyperbolic to an elliptic behavior as the degree of disorder increases  @xcite .    in another experiment , in which a rather small system was studied ( of about 10 diameters in height ) , the slab comprised round - edged rectangular 2d particles  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the response appeared to exhibit a parabolic envelope .",
    "this type of force profile was predicted on the basis of models that assume an uncorrelated , diffusive propagation of the forces , such as the q - model  @xcite ( which was originally proposed to describe the statistics of force fluctuations ) .",
    "however , as mentioned , this system is quite small in terms of the number of constituents ; furthermore , even in this case , it appears that the envelope may be narrowing down near the bottom of the slab .",
    "we shall return to the issue of system size below .    in the simulations reported in  @xcite the _ displacement _ ( rather than the force ) response of a 2d packing of disks of three different diameters",
    "was measured ( in response to a small displacement of a particle at the bottom of the packing ) .",
    "the displacement response is expected to be qualitatively similar to the force response ( in isostatic systems the two are equivalent  @xcite ) .",
    "the measured response ( averaged over several hundred configurations ) is single peaked , and the width of the peak appears to grow as the square root of the height for small system heights , and cross over to a linear dependence at larger heights ( the total height of the packing was about 10 diameters , which is quite small ) .",
    "the response function ( scaled by the width ) is fit quite well by a gaussian .",
    "the same paper  @xcite presents simulations of isostatic systems which show , as expected , a double peaked response .    in the experiments described in  @xcite",
    ", an external localized force was applied at the top of 3d disordered slabs of sand ( and other materials ) , and the response force profiles ( i.e. , the actual forces minus the corresponding forces without the external load ) on the floor were measured .",
    "in this case the applied force was rather small ( a few particle weights ) , and the response was verified to be linear in the applied force .",
    "the measured response was single peaked , the profile width being proportional to the slab depth , as expected for an elastic system .",
    "however , the shape of the response was found to depend on the preparation method : it was wider for loose packings ( obtained by pulling a sieve through the packing ) than for dense packings ( obtained by filling the container layer by layer , pressing the packing after each layer is deposited ) .",
    "the response could not be fitted by isotropic elastic solutions for finite slabs  @xcite .",
    "unlike the highly disordered systems used in  @xcite , the experiments reported in  @xcite concerned ordered 3d close - packed systems of spherical particles , arranged on fcc ( face - centered cubic ) and hcp ( hexagonal close - packed ) lattices  @xcite .",
    "the forces on the floor were measured using pressure marks on carbon paper  @xcite ; the applied forces used in these experiments were quite large ( a few _ thousand _ times the particle weight ) .",
    "the results were averaged over several packings of nominally equal spheres . for shallow systems ,",
    "three distinct peaks were observed in the case of the fcc lattice , and a sharp ring for the hcp lattice .",
    "this is consistent with a description based on propagating forces  @xcite ( which would correspond to a hyperbolic continuum description ) .",
    "however , for larger systems the peaks were considerably less distinct , the response being ` smoother ' .",
    "this further indicates that a hyperbolic - like response may apply only to relatively small systems .",
    "for disordered ( amorphous ) packings  @xcite , a single peak was obtained ( a force impulse was used , since a large persistent force resulted in major rearrangements in the packing ) .    in summary ,",
    "qualitatively different types of response to an external force were observed in experiments on granular assemblies , some of which seem to render support to elliptic models , others to hyperbolic or parabolic models of stress transmission .",
    "the degree of disorder seems to play an important role , as do the size of the system and the magnitude of the applied force . the observed",
    "differences also suggest that other parameters , such as the coefficient of friction , may be important . in order to clarify the role of these parameters and the associated physical mechanisms",
    ", we performed extensive simulations of 2d granular slabs , as described below .",
    "in order to study the response of granular packings and its dependence on the particle properties in more detail , we employ the discrete element method  @xcite ( dem ) , a particle - based simulation method for granular materials also known as the molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation method  @xcite .",
    "this method has been employed in studies of atomic and molecular assemblies as well as granular systems , see , e.g. , @xcite ) for recent reviews . in the present work ,",
    "dem simulations have been employed to study 2d systems composed of disks .",
    "the equations of motion for each particle are integrated using the beeman algorithm  @xcite , which provides more accurate velocities than the commonly used verlet algorithm  @xcite .",
    "we verified that the use of a gear 5-value predictor - corrector algorithm  @xcite does not result in any significant changes in the results .",
    "models for the interactions among solid grains are usually based on contact mechanics  @xcite . following the work of hertz ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) and others , it is customary to assume that the forces exerted by solid particles on each other are pairwise additive . since for relatively rigid particles",
    "the typical deformation of a particle is a very small perturbation to its shape and size , it is common to model these interactions as follows : the particles are fixed in shape and can overlap and the corresponding normal forces ( perpendicular to the plane of contact among particles ) are taken to be functions of the degree of this imaginary overlap .",
    "the tangential interparticle forces are taken to depend on the particles rotations as well .",
    "most natural or industrial granular materials comprise non - spherical particles . however , the latter are difficult to treat theoretically , and only few models for simulating their behavior have been suggested and studied ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . therefore the present paper specializes to disk shaped particles in two dimensions .",
    "the force model we use is essentially the same as that employed in  @xcite ( for some other examples of force schemes commonly used in simulations , see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    for spherical or disk - shaped particles ,",
    "the overlap of two particles is defined by : @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the radii of the particles , @xmath11 is the position of the center of mass of particle , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . in noncohesive granular materials ,",
    "the particles are assumed to interact only when they overlap , i.e. , when @xmath14 .",
    "for two frictionless elastic spheres , a classical result by hertz ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) is that the force is proportional to @xmath15 , while for cylinders , it is linear in @xmath16 ( up to a logarithmic correction , see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in the simulations whose results are presented below the normal component ( parallel to @xmath17 ) of the force is taken to be linear in the overlap ( linear spring ) ; this choice is not due to the fact that we consider cylindrical particles , but rather in order to simplify the application of theoretical considerations .",
    "it may be further justified by the fact that we consider small deformations , in which case one may linearize the force - displacement law around a reference configuration  @xcite .    even for frictionless particles",
    "there can be dissipation , e.g. , due to viscoelastic normal forces that depend on the normal relative velocity @xmath18 ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "while hysteretic , rate independent dissipation models ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) may be more realistic than viscoelastic models , their implementation is more complicated .",
    "since we focus on the static response and small deformations the results should not be sensitive to the precise choice of dissipation mechanism .",
    "we therefore use a damping term which is linear in the relative velocity of interacting particles ( linear dashpot ) .",
    "all in all the normal interparticle force exerted by particle @xmath19 on particle @xmath12 , @xmath20 , can be expressed as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the unit vector in the direction of @xmath17 , @xmath23 is the relative normal velocity of the particles , @xmath24 is a fixed damping constant , and @xmath25 is the heaviside function , @xmath26    next , consider the friction - induced tangential forces . a simple model for friction  @xcite includes tangential springs for modeling static friction , often with velocity - dependent damping to facilitate relaxation to a static configuration .",
    "the springs are generated at zero length , which is also their rest length , when two particles come into contact and `` snap '' when the resulting frictional force , @xmath27 , satisfies @xmath28 , i.e. , when the coulomb limit is exceeded .",
    "once a tangential spring is severed , the corresponding particles are allowed to slip with respect to each other and experience dynamic friction , @xmath29 .",
    "note that the description of static friction in terms of a tangential spring is physically reasonable , and consistent with both contact mechanics on the macroscopic scale  @xcite and microscopic approaches to the description of friction ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for a list of references on friction ) .",
    "the tangential springs are of course quite stiff , giving rise to very small , but measurable  @xcite displacement prior to slip .",
    "tangential springs have often been used to model interparticle interactions in mean - field derivations of granular elasticity  @xcite .",
    "more realistic descriptions of frictional contacts account for the history of contact deformations ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    the above tangential spring - dashpot model in conjunction with coulomb s law of friction serve as the basic tangential force law in the present work , as in  @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", the coefficients of static and dynamic friction are taken equal each other : @xmath30 ( the value of @xmath31 does not directly affect the static configurations which are the main concern in the present work , although it may influence the evolution towards these states ) . in order to employ a tangential spring - dashpot force model ,",
    "a relative tangential displacement has to be defined at each contact .",
    "to this end , note that the relative tangential velocity of two disks ( in 2d ) is given by : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the angular velocity and @xmath34 . in the model used in this work",
    "the force exerted by a tangential spring depends on the relative tangential displacement , @xmath35 , and is given by:@xmath36 where @xmath37 is the tangential spring constant and @xmath35 obeys the following equation:@xmath38h\\left(\\left|\\mu{{\\bf f}}_{ij}^{n}\\right|-k_{t}\\left|{{\\bf s}}_{ij}\\right|\\right),\\ ] ] which ensures that the spring is always tangent to the plane of contact ( a line in 2d ) , and does not exceed the length that corresponds to the coulomb limit .",
    "in addition , @xmath35 is set to zero if there is no overlap ( i.e. , @xmath39 ) . in practice ,",
    "the tangential displacement is obtained by integrating the relative tangential velocity from the time the particles establish contact .",
    "when @xmath40 , the length of the tangential spring is kept fixed in order to prevent the frictional force from exceeding the coulomb limit .",
    "this is important in order to avoid unrealistic behavior when the contacts cease `` sliding '' ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) , and revert to `` sticking '' ( @xmath42 )  @xcite : if the integration of the tangential velocity is continued for a sliding contact , and the result used to further stretch the tangential spring , the result will be an unrealistically large force when the contact reverts to sticking .",
    "note that the torques exerted on the particles determine their angular accelerations ; the corresponding equations are part of the system of equations that are solved .",
    "the interactions of the particles with the walls are similar to the interparticle interactions .",
    "since the walls considered here are rigid and fixed straight lines ( in 2d ) , the overlaps are calculated accordingly , with the same force models .",
    "the force constants for particle - wall interactions ( @xmath43 ) may be specified to be different from those used for particle - particle interactions ( which are taken to be the same for all particle pairs ) .",
    "in addition to interparticle forces and particle - wall forces , the force laws account for gravity .",
    "external forces and torques may also be applied to specific particles ( see below ) .",
    "the systems studied here consist of collections of polydisperse disks , whose radii are uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath44 $ ] . in order to facilitate the use of parameters from experiments performed on short cylinders , the cylinder thickness , @xmath45 , and its volume density , @xmath46 ,",
    "are specified , and the particle masses are given by @xmath47 .",
    "we consider the case of homogeneous disks , for which the axial moment of inertia is given by @xmath48 .",
    "the parameters used in this work correspond to experiments performed by the duke group using 2d photoelastic disks  @xcite : @xmath49 ; @xmath50 ; @xmath51 .",
    "the simulation results are presented in terms of non - dimensional quantities defined as follows .",
    "the length unit is the mean particle radius @xmath52 , the time unit is @xmath53 ( where @xmath54 is the magnitude of the acceleration of gravity ) and the mass unit is the mean particle mass @xmath55 . in simulations which account for gravity",
    ", we use @xmath56 .",
    "the normal spring constant used for particle - particle interactions is @xmath57 .",
    "this value is based on force - displacement measurements performed on the photoelastic disks mentioned above  @xcite .",
    "although the particles are cylindrical , measurements showed a force proportional to the @xmath58 power of the displacement ( possibly indicating that the contact area is elliptic rather than rectangular ) .",
    "for the typical deformations obtained in the experiments , a linear fit to the particle force law provides quite a good description  @xcite , which further justifies our choice of modeling the normal force as that exerted by a linear spring with the above mentioned effective spring constant . for particle - wall interactions , we use @xmath59 .",
    "the damping coefficient is typically chosen to correspond to half the critical damping value for an individual contact , @xmath60 ( recall that @xmath61 and @xmath62 are non - dimensional ) , i.e. , we use @xmath63 .",
    "this value was found to produce the fastest relaxation of the system towards static equilibrium and is irrelevant in the state of mechanical equilibrium itself .",
    "the time step used in the simulations was .",
    "we verified that decreasing the time step did not affect the results of the simulations .",
    "other simulation parameters such as the ratio @xmath64 ( and @xmath65 , which is taken to equal it ) , the coefficients of friction @xmath66 and the polydispersity @xmath67 were varied in different runs , and their influence is discussed below .      the initial configuration is produced by placing the particles on a triangular lattice with lattice constant @xmath68 . the side walls and the floor",
    "are placed at a distance @xmath69 from the centers of the particles closest to the walls ( so that for a monodisperse packing , @xmath70 , these particles are tangent to the side walls and the floor ) .",
    "the initial ( translational and angular ) velocities for all particles are set to zero .",
    "the system is then allowed to relax under gravity until it reaches static equilibrium , as described below .    in order to study the response to a localized force ,",
    "the resulting configuration ( with all velocities , translational and angular , reset to zero ) is used as an initial configuration for a second run of the simulation , in which an additional external force ( and/or an external torque in some simulations ) is applied to a particle at the center of the top row of particles .",
    "the force is increased linearly in time from zero to its desired value .",
    "the system is then relaxed again to static equilibrium .",
    "the main criterion used for testing whether the system has reached static equilibrium ( at which time the simulation is stopped ) is the kinetic energy per particle .",
    "we found that in order to obtain an accuracy of less than 1% for the forces on the floor in a given realization , which are used here to define the response of the system to a localized force , the system has to be relaxed to a kinetic energy of @xmath71 per particle , which is significantly smaller than that used in previous studies ( e.g. , in  @xcite , the systems are relaxed to @xmath72 per particle ) . for polydisperse systems the response was coarse grained and averaged over a number of different configurations ( sec .",
    "[ sec : disorder ] ) , since the forces exhibit strong fluctuations . in this case , sufficient accuracy was obtained with @xmath73 .",
    "we verified that several other criteria for static equilibrium ( see  @xcite ) were satisfied : the contact network was fixed for at least several hundred time steps ( and each particle had at least two contacts ) , there were no sliding contacts , and the mean particle acceleration was less than @xmath74 .    for frictionless systems ( @xmath75 , we found that reaching such small energies in a reasonable simulation time was very difficult due to the existence of slow global modes with a low dissipation rate , so that the following algorithm was used for accelerating the relaxation : the md simulation was stopped at a higher energy ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the configuration obtained at this stage was used as a reference state around which ( since the interactions are harmonic in the static case ) the linearized equations of motion were used iteratively to obtain a system which is closer to static equilibrium . in each iteration the equations were solved by matrix inversion , and the connectivity of the particles was updated to ensure that there was no tension .",
    "the iterations were stopped when the maximal relative particle displacement was less than @xmath77 ( which is essentially the numerical accuracy ) .",
    "the typical kinetic energy obtained when using the resulting configuration as an initial configuration for the full dem simulation was less than @xmath78 per particle .",
    "this configuration was then used for calculating the interparticle forces .",
    "an example of the interparticle forces obtained in a typical simulation run is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim - forces ] . in order to calculate the response to an applied force , the forces due to gravity alone ( without the applied force )",
    "are subtracted ( vectorially ) at each contact .",
    "consider first frictionless particles , interacting by unilateral ( `` one - sided '' ) springs , which apply force only when compressed , modeling repulsive - only particle interactions  @xcite , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : normal_force ] ) .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , the application of a localized force at the top of the packing can lead to rearrangements in the contact network : horizontal springs in the region below the point of application of the force are opened ( as also observed in  @xcite for a pile geometry ) . the force chains in this system are qualitatively similar to those obtained with regular ( `` two - sided '' ) springs",
    ". however , the force magnitudes vs.  the horizontal coordinate at different depths are expectedly in better agreement with experiment in the case of one - sided springs  @xcite than that of regular springs  @xcite , since the former model is more realistic for granular systems . the stress distribution obtained for unilateral springs",
    "@xcite is anisotropic , and shows two peaks at the floor .",
    "this anisotropy is obviously related to the existence of a region of open horizontal contacts where the anisotropy is large and the hyperbolic limit applies  @xcite .",
    "this anisotropy is not present in the system without the application of the external forces ; it is induced ( through the changes in the contact network ) by the applied force  @xcite .",
    "the induced changes in the contact network obviously qualify as a nonlinear process .",
    "these changes in the contact network may be modeled as a nonlinear extension of the linear elastic continuum behavior obtained in a network of harmonic springs . while the ( possibly position - dependent ) elastic moduli in linear elasticity are time - independent material properties , a possible extension is to introduce a stress history dependence of the elastic moduli ( i.e. , the anisotropy induced by the opening of contacts in certain regions may be considered a result of an attempted tensile stress in those regions ) .",
    "a similar type of stress - induced anisotropy has been suggested in the context of plastic models of soil mechanics  @xcite as well as in nonlinear elastic models  @xcite .",
    "if the particle positions do not change significantly , so that only the contact network is modified in response to the applied stress , the behavior can possibly be modeled as `` incrementally elastic '' . under certain conditions ( corresponding to plastic yield ) ,",
    "the system is no longer able to support the applied stress without a major rearrangement of the particles .",
    "incipient plastic yield may be related to a local extreme anisotropy typical of a marginally stable isostatic configuration .      in order to examine the changes in the contact network in more detail , we performed dem simulations , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : sim ] , of a system similar to those discussed in  @xcite , with different applied forces .",
    "we focused on systems of 15 layers of 60 particles each ; the effect of system size is discussed below . the force response on the floor ( subtracting the effect of gravity )",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : response - diff - fext - nofric ] .",
    "a crossover from a single peaked to a double peaked response occurs as the applied force is increased .    .",
    "]    the changes in the contact network corresponding to the systems of fig .",
    "[ fig : response - diff - fext - nofric ] are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : netdiff - frictionless ] . for a sufficiently small force ( not shown ) , the contact network is unchanged , and the response is fully elastic ( see sec .  [ sec : friction ] for a discussion of the linearity of the response ) .",
    "as the force is increased , horizontal contacts are opened in a teardrop shaped region below the point of application of the force , whose size increases with the force and decreases with friction . as mentioned above , in this region the extreme anisotropic limit of elasticity applies .",
    "when the `` teardrop '' is sufficiently far from the floor [ fig .",
    "[ fig : netdiff_f1.5]- ] , the response at the floor is single peaked , as the changes induced by the force can be considered to be localized . otherwise , the anisotropy induced by the external force reaches the floor ( fig .",
    "[ fig : netdiff_f6 ] , inducing a double peaked response ( the crossover actually occurs at slightly smaller forces , at which the `` teardrop '' almost reaches the floor ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     this explanation is similar to st .",
    "venant s principle  ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , which states ( for a _ linear elastic _ system ) that the difference in stresses and strains in the interior of an elastic body due to two separate but statically equivalent systems of surface tractions ( same overall force and torque ) , are negligible sufficiently far from the area where the loads are applied . in the case considered here , the system is certainly not strictly elastic for @xmath79 ( due to the effects of contact network changes and sliding ) .",
    "however , the response to a localized force ( in an elastic medium ) decays with the distance from the point of application as a power law ( e.g. , the solutions for an infinite half plane or half space [ boussinesq s problem ] , which decay like @xmath80 in 2d and @xmath81 in 3d  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , as the distance from the point of application increases , the relative displacements of the particles become smaller , and they are less likely to reach the nonlinear regime ( the finite region of open contacts discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : friction ] is an example of such a nonlinear effect ) , so that far from the point of application of the force , the system becomes `` more elastic '' and the response to a distributed load is the same ( or nearly the same ) as the response to the resultant load .",
    "this suggestion may apply to recent experiments  @xcite on a 2d system subject to a small cyclic displacement , which shows a @xmath82 decay of the displacement field at large distances from the perturbation .",
    "the results described in the previous section help to interpret the experimental results reviewed in sec .  [ sec : response - experiments ] . to this end , it is important to note that the different experiments described in sec .  [",
    "sec : response - experiments ] correspond to different regions of the phase diagram [ fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] ] described in sec .",
    "[ sec : disorder ] .",
    "as mentioned , experiments on 2d systems using photoelastic particles  @xcite typically use a rather large applied force ( @xmath83 in these experiments ) , required in order to obtain a significant photoelastic effect . in these experiments",
    "the interparticle forces , rather than the macroscopic stress , were measured ( the forces on the floor have not been measured ) .",
    "these are reproduced quite well by our dem simulations with friction ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : friction ] ) .",
    "it is yet unclear whether these experiments are compatible with the phase diagram of sec .",
    "[ sec : disorder ] , since the macroscopic stress has not been measured directly in these experiments .",
    "the experiments reported in  @xcite used disordered systems with a rather small applied force ( a few times the particle weight ) , for which a single peak was observed , in agreement with the phase diagram .",
    "since these experiments used sand , rather than spherical particles , the effective coefficient of static friction may be much larger than @xmath84 , so that sliding is less likely to occur .",
    "note that those experiments were performed on a 3d system , while the simulations reported here are in 2d ; however , we expect similar qualitative features of the phase diagram in 3d systems .",
    "the difference in the responses of dense and loose sand  @xcite , as well as the deviations from the isotropic elastic prediction observed in both cases , may be explained by a ( small ) anisotropy , induced by the packing construction process ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "we believe that the anisotropy induced by the small applied force in these experiments should be negligible ( note that the systems studied in  @xcite are also deeper , in terms of particle diameters , than the ones studied in  @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to the experiments reported in  @xcite , the experiments reported in  @xcite on ordered 3d packings used a very large force of a few thousand times the particle weights .",
    "several distinct peaks were observed for shallow systems .",
    "these peaks became more diffuse for deeper systems . in the absence of horizontal contacts ,",
    "the coordination number in the hcp and fcc lattice is reduced to @xmath85 ( each particle is in contact with @xmath86 particles in the layer above it and that below it ) .",
    "this corresponds to the isostatic limit ( in the absence of friction ) .",
    "apparently , the experimentalists attempted to avoid horizontal contacts by choosing the appropriate wall spacing ; even if some horizontal contacts were present , it is likely that such a large force opened the horizontal contacts , at least in the top layers .",
    "since the force is large , it may also lead to sliding at most of the contacts ( at least in the top layers ) , so that for shallow systems , the observed behavior is extremely anisotropic , and , as mentioned , near the isostatic limit .",
    "however , in deeper systems , the opening of contacts and sliding may be reduced ( as we observed for @xmath87 ) , reducing the anisotropy ( note that even the deepest layers in the described experiment were not very deep : about 20 layers ) . in amorphous packings ,",
    "a single peak was observed ( however , the method of application of the force was different : a force impulse was used , which may correspond to a weaker force in our quasi - static description ) .",
    "thus , the results of the experiments reported in  @xcite are also consistent with the schematic phase diagram presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : disorder ] .",
    "the phase diagram may also explain the striking difference observed in  @xcite between the experimentally measured displacement response in packings of ( frictional ) disks subject to a localized displacement ( which exhibits a single peak ) , and the results of simulations of frictionless isostatic packings ( which exhibits two peaks ) .",
    "note , however , that the mean coordination number in the frictionless polydisperse systems studied here ( e.g. , @xmath88 for @xmath89 ) is well above the isostatic limit of @xmath90 .",
    "it is , however , much smaller than that of the ideal triangular lattice , @xmath91 , the `` missing '' contacts being predominantly horizontal .",
    "this suggests that the anisotropic ( `` hyperbolic - like '' ) response of frictionless systems may arise , at least for small polydispersity , from the anisotropic structure of these systems rather than their ( near)-isostaticity , as suggested in  @xcite .",
    "we performed simulations studying the response of a 2d granular slab to a localized force , in particular the effects of the magnitude of the applied force , the frictional parameters and the polydispersity .",
    "our results indicate that _ anisotropy _ , which is induced by changes in the contact network and frictional sliding due to applied force , gives rise to a hyperbolic - like response ( as already suggested in  @xcite ) .",
    "however , we show that this effect becomes less pronounced for large systems ( which is more likely to be the case in most engineering applications ) and/or systems subject to smaller applied forces for a given system size .",
    "this may explain why small - scale experiments sometimes yield a hyperbolic - like response while elasticity is typically used for describing small deformations in engineering practice .",
    "in addition , _ friction _ , which is present in all real granular systems , increases the range of linearity in the applied force and further reduces the effect of stress - induced anisotropy , rendering the response even closer to that predicted by isotropic elasticity . the same behavior is observed in polydisperse systems , which is the typical case in nature , although in polydisperse systems the forces at which induced anisotropy becomes large are smaller .",
    "the validity of superposition beyond the linear elastic regime indicates that sufficiently far from the applied load , the system responds ( nearly ) elastically even though it is not elastic everywhere .",
    "the above considerations should also be relevant for the case of granular piles , whose properties depend strongly on their construction history  @xcite .",
    "for instance , when the pile is grown from a point source , it is shaped by successive avalanches , all of which are initiated in the apex area ( beneath the source ) .",
    "the nature of the granular flow ( i.e. , the avalanches ) in the case of formation by flow from an extended source is clearly different from that corresponding to a point source . in particular ,",
    "the degree of anisotropy of piles constructed from a point source is larger than that of piles built from an extended ( and approximately uniform ) source  @xcite . in the former case",
    ", there is a dip in the pressure distribution on the floor , whereas in the latter there is no dip . in  @xcite",
    ", this effect was described in terms of orientations of force chains , which may also reflect the macroscopic anisotropy .",
    "however , we believe that once the ( possibly inhomogeneous ) anisotropy in the pile is taken into account , the stress distribution under the pile should be compatible with an elastic picture .",
    "the question of how this anisotropy is created during construction will probably require a more detailed description of the pile dynamics , possibly involving the changes in the contact network ( and sliding ) which lead to macroscopic anisotropy .    in general ,",
    "the elastic description of granular solids is expected to be valid for sufficiently large scales ( and system sizes ) and not - too - large applied forces . outside this range ,",
    "such a description may need to be extended by using a nonlinear , incrementally elastic continuum model , with stress - history dependent elastic moduli ( which reflect the induced anisotropy , and may exhibit hyperbolic - like behavior ) .",
    "the nonlinear effects of broken contacts and frictional sliding should be important in understanding the failure of granular materials .",
    "in particular , the dominant effect of tangential forces in such failure , e.g. , in the transition to an asymmetric response described in sec .  [",
    "sec : fric - largemu ] , as well as the effects of applied torques ( sec .",
    "[ sec : apptorque ] ) and of rolling resistance , support the suggestion that , at least on intermediate scales , continuum models of micropolar , or cosserat type  @xcite may be required ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we note , as a suggestion for a future experiment , that one should be able to observe experimentally the crossover we obtain in the simulations with increasing applied force , from a single peaked to a double peaked response ; in such an experiment , the setup should be sufficiently sensitive to measure the response to a small force ( in the linear regime ) but also sufficiently robust to enable the application of larger forces . in addition",
    ", the force would have to be applied slowly , to avoid plastic flow of the material .",
    "such an experiment would be very useful in testing the applicability of the above physical considerations to real granular materials .",
