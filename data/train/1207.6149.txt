    "a classical heat engine consists of a cyclic sequence of reversible transformations over a `` working substance '' , typically a macroscopic mass of fluid enclosed in a cylinder with a mobile piston at one end @xcite .",
    "the two most famous examples are the otto and carnot cycles .",
    "in particular , the classical carnot cycle comprises four stages , two isothermal and two adiabatic ( iso - entropic ) ones .",
    "ideal quasi - static and reversible conditions are achieved by assuming that an external force , which differs only infinitesimally from the force exerted by the internal pressure of the fluid , is applied to the piston in order to let it move extremely slowly@xcite . on the other hand , the isothermal trajectories are performed by bringing the fluid contained by the cylinder into thermal equilibrium with external reservoirs at temperatures @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "a quantum analogue of a heat engine involves a sequence of transformations ( trajectories ) in hilbert s space , where the `` working substance '' is of quantum mechanical nature@xcite .",
    "one of the simplest conceptual realizations of this idea is a system composed by a single - particle trapped in a one - dimensional infinite potential well @xcite .",
    "the different trajectories are driven by a quasi - static deformation of the potential well , due to the application of an external force .",
    "two different schemes of this process have been discussed in the literature , in the context of a non - relativistic particle whose energy eigenstates are determined by the schrdinger spectrum @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall revisit these approaches , and we will study the performance of the corresponding heat engine for a single dirac particle . since dirac s equation describes the spectra of relativistic particles , results obtained for this case should reduce to the corresponding ones from schrdinger s equation in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "as we shall discuss below , the transition between the relativistic and non - relativistic regimes is determined by the ratio @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the compton wavelength of the particle , and @xmath3 the width of the potential well .",
    "the non - relativistic limit corresponds to the regime where @xmath4 , while evidence of the underlying relativistic nature of the spectrum manifests in terms of finite corrections in powers of @xmath1 .",
    "another limit of theoretical interest is the `` ultra - relativistic '' case of massless dirac particles , where @xmath5 .",
    "an important realization of this former case in solid state systems is provided by conduction electrons in the vicinity of the so called dirac point in graphene @xcite .",
    "the problem of a dirac particle in the presence of a one - dimensional , finite potential well @xmath6 is expressed by the dirac hamiltonian operator @xcite , @xmath7 here , @xmath8 are dirac matrices in 4 dimensions , with @xmath9 the pauli matrices .",
    "the domain of this operator is @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the hilbert space of ( complex - valued ) 4-component spinors @xmath12 , where each component @xmath13 is therefore a square - integrable function in the unbounded domain @xmath14 . for a _",

    "this behavior and some of its consequences is denominated klein s paradox@xcite .",
    "we remark that this effect occurs when attempting to confine the particle with a _",
    "finite _ potential well .",
    "the mathematical and physical pictures are rather different when considering the singular limit of an _ infinite _ potential well , @xmath22    the singular character of the infinite potential well , exactly as in the more familiar schrdinger case @xcite , requires a different mathematical statement of the problem : one needs to define a self - adjoint extension @xcite of the _ free _ particle hamiltonian @xmath23 whose domain @xmath24 is a dense proper subset of the hilbert space @xmath25 of square - integrable ( complex - valued ) 4-component spinors in the closed interval @xmath26 $ ] . in general , the domain of @xmath27 and its adjoint @xmath28 verify @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "however , physics requires for @xmath27 to be self - adjoint .",
    "the self - adjoint extension is obtained by imposing appropriate boundary conditions @xcite on the spinors at the boundary @xmath30 of the finite domain @xmath31 , as discussed in detail in appendix a. in particular , the condition of simultaneous vanishing of the four components of the spinor at the boundaries @xmath32 is not compatible with self - adjointness and , moreover , leads to the trivial null solution @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "instead , as shown in appendix a , the mathematical condition for self - adjointness corresponds to a vanishing probability current at the boundary @xmath35 of the domain @xmath36 $ ] , @xmath37 , with @xmath38 .",
    "the physical interpretation of this mathematical condition is rather obvious : the particle is indeed `` trapped '' inside the infinite potential well , since there is a zero probability current through the boundary walls .",
    "this approach has been used in the past , for instance , to model confinement of hadrons in finite regions of space @xcite .",
    "summarizing , the eigenvalue problem for the self - adjoint extension of the free dirac hamiltonian eq.([eq3 ] ) representing particles `` trapped '' inside the infinite potential well is given by @xmath39 subject to the boundary conditions @xmath40 as shown explicitly in appendix a , there is a whole family of eigenfunctions of eq.([eq3b ] ) in @xmath41 $ ] , satisfying the boundary conditions eq.([eq3c ] ) .",
    "this has been investigated for instance in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a fundamental discrete symmetry of the dirac hamiltonian is its invariance under parity @xcite ( @xmath42 : @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) , @xmath45=0 $ ] , which corresponds to a mirror spatial reflection by leaving the spin direction invariant .",

    "as shown in detail in appendix a , this leads to a quantization of the wavenumbers , @xmath56 , for @xmath57 .",
    "the spinor - eigenfunctions obtained from this analysis are @xmath58 with associated discrete energy eigenvalues , @xmath59 here , we have subtracted the rest energy , and @xmath60 is the compton wavelength .",
    "the positive sign corresponds to the particle solution @xcite .    the spectrum predicted by eq.([eq5 ] ) , as well as the probability density obtained from eq.([eq4 ] ) , can be compared with the corresponding schrdinger problem , whose eigenvalues are given by @xmath61 here , a single eigenvalue for the energy is obtained and , moreover , it scales as @xmath62 , in contrast with the dirac particle case where a richer scaling with @xmath63 is observed .",
    "in particular , in the regime @xmath4 , we have : @xmath64 corresponding to the non - relativistic limit . beyond this regime ,",
    "relativistic corrections depending on the finite ratio @xmath1 are observed .    regarding the probability density , in the corresponding schrdinger problem one obtains @xmath65 for @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that , in the non - relativistic limit @xmath4 , the `` small '' component of the spinor in eq.([eq4 ] ) becomes negligible , and thus the probability density converges to the schrdinger case , @xmath67 .",
    "another interesting limit of eq.([eq5 ] ) corresponds to a massless dirac particle with @xmath68 , where the spectrum reduces to the expression @xmath69 this situation may be of interest in graphene systems , where conduction electrons in the vicinity of the so called dirac point can be described as effective massless chiral particles , satisfying dirac s equation in two dimensions@xcite .",
    "as the `` working substance '' for a quantum heat engine , let us consider a statistical ensemble of copies of a single - particle system , where each copy may be in any of the possible different energy eigenstates .",
    "we therefore say that the single - particle system is in a statistically mixed quantum state@xcite .",
    "the corresponding density matrix operator is @xmath70 , with @xmath71 an eigenstate of the single - particle hamiltonian eq.([eq3 ] ) , corresponding to the spinors defined by eq.([eq4 ] ) .",

    "the ensemble - average energy of the quantum single - particle system is @xmath79    for the statistical ensemble just defined , we conceive two different schemes for a quantum analogue of a thermodynamic heat engine . the first one , that we shall refer to as the isoenergetic cycle , consists on four stages of reversible trajectories : two iso - entropic and two iso - energetic ones , as originally proposed by bender et al.@xcite in the context of a schrdinger particle .",
    "during the iso - energetic trajectories , the ensemble - average energy eq.([eq11 ] ) is conserved , while during the iso - entropic ones , the von neumann entropy defined by eq.([eq10 ] ) remains constant .",
    "we distinguish this first scheme from the quantum carnot cycle to be discussed next , where the iso - energetic trajectories in hilbert s space are replaced by isothermal processes . during these stages ,",

    "the system trajectories in hilbert s space are assumed to be driven by reversible quasi - static processes , in which the walls of the potential well are deformed `` very slowly '' by an applied external force , such that the distance @xmath3 is modified accordingly . along these trajectories ,",
    "the total change in the ensemble average energy of the system is given by @xmath81 the first term in eq.([eq12 ] ) represents the total energy change due to an iso - entropic process , whereas the second term represents a trajectory where the energy spectrum remains rigid .",

    "the external force driving the change in the width of the potential well is equal to the internal `` pressure '' of the one - dimensional system , @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , the work performed by the system against the external force , when the width of the potential well expands from @xmath84 to @xmath85 , is given by @xmath86 .",
