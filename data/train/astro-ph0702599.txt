    "planetary bow shocks and interplanetary shocks serve as a unique laboratory for the study of shock waves in collisionless plasmas .",
    "observations of these shocks usually show that ion distributions are anisotropic with respect to the background magnetic field downstream of the shocks .",
    "mirror mode waves associated with this anisotropy are observed downstream of quasi - perpendicular shocks ( defined by the angle between the shock normal and the upstream magnetic field @xmath0 ) when the plasma beta is high ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "mirror mode waves do not grow in low beta regions where the ion cyclotron mode dominates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "magnetic fluctuations downstream of quasi - parallel shocks ( @xmath2 ) have not been identified in detail , but hybrid simulations show that the firehose instability can occur downstream of these shocks for certain ranges of upstream alfvn mach number ( @xmath3 ) and plasma beta , for instance , @xmath4 at @xmath5 @xcite ; observations seem to confirm this point ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "quasi - perpendicular shocks are characterized by a sharp increase in the magnetic field strength , but quasi - parallel shocks are often more turbulent , with shock ramps containing large - amplitude waves which spread upstream and downstream .",
    "the recent crossing of the termination shock ( ts ) by voyager 1 ( v1 ) @xcite provides an opportunity to study shocks and shock - induced waves in the heliosheath .",
    "the sharp increase in the magnetic field strength across the ts and the downstream magnetic field configuration suggest that the ts is quasi - perpendicular @xcite . as in planetary magnetosheaths downstream of a quasi - perpendicular bow shock",
    ", the heliosheath shows compressive magnetic fluctuations in the form of magnetic holes @xcite .",
    "we propose a theoretical explanation for the temperature anisotropies and associated instabilities induced at a shock .",
    "based on the theoretical analysis , we show that the magnetic holes observed in the heliosheath could be mirror mode fluctuations .",
    "the present results also provide a prototype for understanding shocks in various astrophysical contexts , such as gamma - ray bursts , supernova explosions and active galactic nuclei .",
    "an anisotropic ion distribution requires the use of a pressure tensor in the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations .",
    "observations show that the shock structure and dynamics depend on the shock geometry and upstream @xmath6 and @xmath7 , so we examine the temperature anisotropy @xmath8 as a function of these parameters , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the plasma temperature perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "the subscripts 1 and 2 indicate physical parameters upstream and downstream of a shock . assuming a bi - maxwellian plasma",
    ", we write the jump conditions across a shock as @xcite @xmath11 = 0,\\ ] ] @xmath12 = 0,\\ ] ] @xmath13 = 0,\\ ] ] @xmath14 = 0,\\ ] ] @xmath15 = 0,\\ ] ] @xmath16=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the permeability of vacuum , @xmath18 is the plasma density , and * v * and * b * are the plasma velocity and magnetic field with subscripts @xmath19 and @xmath20 denoting the tangential and normal components with respect to the shock surface . the velocity is measured in the shock frame .",
    "the square brackets indicate the difference between the preshock ( 1 ) and postshock ( 2 ) states .",
    "the perpendicular and parallel plasma pressures are defined as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent the boltzmann constant and proton mass , respectively . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that the bulk velocity is parallel to the shock normal .",
    "the components of the magnetic field upstream of the shock are given by @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "different forms of the solutions to these equations have been derived based on various assumptions @xcite .",
    "the focus of the present analysis is to investigate under what conditions the shocked plasma is unstable to the thermal anisotropy instabilities .",
    "the thermal anisotropy serves a free energy source which can feed magnetic fluctuations when it exceeds certain threshold conditions .",
    "the thresholds can be expressed as @xmath27 for the firehose instability @xcite , the lower bound of the temperature anisotropy , and @xmath28 for the mirror mode instability @xcite , the upper bound .",
    "the ion cyclotron instability , competing with the mirror mode , has the onset condition @xmath29 @xcite . here",
    "the perpendicular and parallel plasma betas are defined as @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    for a perpendicular shock",
    ", equations  ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) give the shock strength @xmath32 the temperature anisotropy @xmath33 can be obtained from equations  ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , @xmath34 where @xmath35 . to compare with the thresholds",
    ", we derive @xmath36 from equation  ( 4 ) as @xmath37 for @xmath38 , we have @xmath39 , so the shocked plasma would have a high beta independent of @xmath7 , consistent with the findings in the magnetosheaths of outer planets @xcite .",
    "as can be seen from the mirror - mode threshold , high values of @xmath36 favor the onset of the mirror mode instability ; similarly , @xmath40 under the same condition , so @xmath41 since the shock strength can not be larger than 4 , also favoring the mirror mode onset .",
    "figure  1 shows the temperature anisotropy @xmath33 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 as a function of @xmath44 and @xmath7",
    ". only values of @xmath45 are shown .",
    "the entropy , @xmath46 , is required to increase across a shock by the second law of thermodynamics ; the region which breaks the entropy principle is show as `` forbidden '' in figure  1 .",
    "the majority of the allowed area has @xmath41 as expected and is preferentially unstable to the mirror mode instability .",
    "the mirror mode has a lower threshold than the cyclotron mode in this plasma regime , so the temperature anisotropy would be quickly reduced by the mirror mode before the ion cyclotron mode could develop .",
    "the ts with @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( see  3 ) , indicated by the plus sign , is located slightly above the mirror mode threshold .",
    "interplanetary and planetary bow shocks have a large variation in @xmath44 and @xmath7 ; many of them would also be above the mirror mode threshold as indicated by the large area with @xmath41 .",
    "consequently , mirror mode instabilities should be a frequent feature downstream of quasi - perpendicular shocks .    for a parallel shock",
    ", the magnetic field does not go into the expression of the shock strength .",
    "the temperature anisotropy @xmath49 and the downstream parallel plasma beta @xmath50 for @xmath38 , @xmath51 , which makes the thresholds close to 1 , and @xmath52 , giving favorable conditions for the onset of the firehose instability .",
    "figure  2 displays the temperature anisotropy @xmath33 over various upstream conditions for @xmath53 and @xmath43 .",
    "compared with figure  1 , higher values of @xmath44 at a given @xmath7 would otherwise lead to smaller @xmath33 .",
    "most of the area shown has @xmath54 as expected for a quasi - parallel shock and is unstable to the firehose instability .",
    "the ts would induce firehose instabilities in the downstream plasma if it were quasi - parallel , as indicated by its location in the plot .",
    "many quasi - parallel interplanetary and planetary bow shocks will also give rise to firehose instabilities as implied by the large area with @xmath55 .",
    "observations show that a quasi - parallel bow shock becomes unsteady as the alfvn mach number @xmath6 exceeds @xmath56 for @xmath57 @xcite and is often associated with large transverse magnetic fluctuations @xcite",
    ". a closer look at figure  2 gives @xmath58 at @xmath59 for @xmath60 , a noticeable thermal anisotropy but not large enough to exceed the firehose onset ; at @xmath61 , the thermal anisotropy rises above the firehose threshold , generating firehose instabilities which will disturb the shock structure .",
    "the firehose instability arises from the fast mhd mode and produces large - amplitude transverse waves .",
    "the results from this simple calculation agree with hybrid simulations @xcite .",
    "v1 crossed the ts on 2004 december 16 ( day 351 ) at 94 au and is making the first measurements in the heliosheath .",
    "the magnetic fluctuations in the heliosheath are characterized by a series of depressions in the field magnitude which have been called magnetic holes @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations are similar to those observed downstream of quasi - perpendicular interplanetary and planetary bow shocks that have been identified as mirror mode structures @xcite .",
    "the ts is expected to be highly oblique with @xmath62 at v1 , so we use equations  ( 8) and ( 9 ) to determine whether mirror mode instabilities occur in the heliosheath .",
    "mhd simulations give the average preshock plasma density @xmath63 @xmath64 , speed @xmath65 km s@xmath66 , and temperature @xmath67 k @xcite , which yields @xmath48 , @xmath47 combined with the observed field strength @xmath68 nt .",
    "the shock strength @xmath69 is @xmath56 estimated from the jump in the field magnitude @xcite and from the spectral slope of ts accelerated particles @xcite .",
    "the typical thermal anisotropy of the solar wind is @xmath70 near the earth @xcite .",
    "expansion of the solar wind would further decrease the value of @xmath71 if the magnetic moment @xmath72 is invariant ; when the thermal anisotropy exceeds the firehose threshold , firehose instabilities will be induced and help suppress the growth of the anisotropy .",
    "the two competing processes will arrive at a balance close to the threshold , i.e. , @xmath73 , which gives @xmath74 .",
    "introduction of pickup ions in the outer heliosphere would not significantly change this value .",
    "the newly - born pickup ions gyrate about the interplanetary magnetic field , forming a ring - beam distribution ; this configuration is unstable to the generation of mhd waves , which scatter the ions quickly toward isotropy @xcite .",
    "we have also shown that @xmath33 does not depend on @xmath75 when @xmath38 .",
    "substituting the values of @xmath44 , @xmath7 , @xmath69 and @xmath75 into equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) gives @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the threshold of the mirror mode is @xmath78 , smaller than the downstream anisotropy . as indicated by figure  1",
    ", even an @xmath33 slightly larger than 1 can meet the mirror mode onset at high @xmath7 , so mirror mode instabilities should be induced in the heliosheath .    for the upstream temperature , we have used the density - weighted average of the pickup ion , solar wind proton and electron temperatures @xcite .",
    "however , the result can be shown to be self - consistent .",
    "equation  9 is reduced to @xmath79 in the ts case , from which we have the downstream temperature @xmath80 k given the average field magnitude @xmath81 nt and density @xmath82 @xmath64 from equation  7 . approximating the ts as a hydrodynamic shock because of the high plasma beta , @xmath83[(\\gamma-1)m^2 + 2 ] } { ( \\gamma+1)^2m^2},\\ ] ] we obtain @xmath84 k , consistent with the mhd simulation result . here @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , the shock mach number estimated from @xmath87 .",
    "given the absence of plasma measurements across the ts , it is hard to estimate the uncertainties brought about by the upstream conditions and the shock parameters . a revisit to equations  ( 1)-(6 ) assuming a 10% error in the upstream conditions and the shock geometry and strength gives @xmath88 and a mirror mode threshold @xmath89 .",
    "note that the uncertainty of @xmath33 is determined largely by the shock strength , since @xmath90 in the case of the ts .",
    "if we use @xmath91 inferred from the particle spectra @xcite with other parameters fixed , then the temperature anisotropy @xmath92 - @xmath93 ; the mirror mode would be more likely to occur .",
    "interestingly , the shock strength can not be smaller than 2.2 at the present conditions ; otherwise @xmath33 would be negative .",
    "it should be emphasized that turbulence induced by the mirror mode instability would leave the threshold marginally satisfied , so we expect @xmath94 in the evolved state .",
    "the mirror mode instability has maximum growth rate at a wave vector highly oblique to the background magnetic field .",
    "the minimum variance direction of the measured magnetic fields has an angle of about 75@xmath95 with respect to the background field when magnetic holes are present @xcite .",
    "mirror mode waves are non - propagating and appear to be static structures , consistent with the observed magnetic fluctuations with a fairly constant field direction @xcite .",
    "mirror mode waves are also characterized by anti - correlated density and magnetic fluctuations .",
    "the density measurements are not available , so we can not verify the mirror mode from density fluctuations .",
    "the density perturbation @xmath96 can be estimated from @xcite @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the perturbation in the field strength .",
    "the fluctuation amplitude @xmath99 is @xmath100 - 0.9 in the heliosheath , which results in @xmath101 - 0.03 , too small to be resolved by future v2 observations .",
    "the non - linear evolution of mirror mode instabilities would also generate holes in the background field strength @xcite .",
    "the magnetic holes in the heliosheath are of the similar size ( in units of the proton gyroradius ) to those in planetary magnetosheaths that are predominately produced by mirror mode waves @xcite .",
    "magnetic holes in planetary magnetosheaths have also been explained as slow mode solitons based on hall - mhd theory @xcite .",
    "the plasma beta in the heliosheath is @xmath102 40 as estimated above ; in this case the ion larmor radius is much larger than the ion inertial length , so the hall - mhd theory breaks down @xcite .",
    "deep in the heliosheath , magnetic field lines may be draped and compressed against the heliopause if there is no significant reconnection between the solar wind and interstellar fields .",
    "analogous to planetary magnetosheaths , the plasma would be squeezed and flow along the draped field lines , leading to a plasma depletion layer close to the heliopause .",
    "the plasma beta is reduced in this layer , so the mirror mode instability may be inhibited and ion cyclotron waves may be generated .",
    "damping of these waves would suppress the thermal anisotropy and heat the plasma @xcite .",
    "a simple calculation based on temperature anisotropy instabilities explains a variety of observations associated with interplanetary and planetary bow shocks .",
    "a shock modifies the velocity distribution of particles at its surface , producing instabilities downstream of the shock which give rise to different types of waves .",
    "the calculation also predicts that mirror mode waves form downstream of the ts , which is consistent with the observed magnetic fluctuations .",
    "the present results provide a substantial basis for shock - induced anisotropies which act as an energy source for plasma heating in various space and astrophysical environments .",
    "the research was supported under nasa contract 959203 from jpl to mit , nasa grant nag5 - 11623 , and by the nasa planetary atmospheres and outer planets programs .",
