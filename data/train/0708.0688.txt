    "the @xmath0 massive black hole ( mbh ) in the galactic center ( gc ) @xcite and the stars around it are the closest and observationally most accessible of such systems .",
    "observations of the gc thus offer a unique opportunity to study in great detail the effects of the mbh and its extreme environment on star formation , stellar evolution and stellar dynamics , and the interactions of stars and compact remnants with the mbh .    here",
    "the focus is stellar relaxation processes .",
    "relaxation plays an important role in a wide range of phenomena that involve close interactions with a mbh ( the `` loss - cone problem '' ,  [ ss : lc ] ) .",
    "such processes include gravitational wave ( gw ) emission by compact remnants inspiraling into a mbh ( `` extreme - mass ratio inspiral events '' ( emris , see review by @xcite , tidal flares from tidal disruption events @xcite , tidal capture and tidal scattering of stars @xcite , 3-body exchanges with binaries leading to the capture of stars on tight orbits around the mbh and the ejection of hyper velocity stars ( hvss ) out of the galaxy @xcite , the orbital decay and coalescence of a binary mbhs ( and the `` last parsec stalling problem '' , see review by @xcite ) , and perhaps also the formation of ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) in star clusters following stellar capture around an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) @xcite .",
    "relaxation processes are possibly linked to the presence and properties of unusual stellar populations that are observed near mbhs , such as the central `` s - star '' cluster , the stellar disks in the gc @xcite and the stellar disk in m31 @xcite .",
    "dynamical relaxation by star - star interactions is inherent to the discreteness of stellar systems . in the absence of additional mechanisms to randomize stars in phase - space , standard 2-body stellar relaxation assures a minimal degree of randomization , albeit one that could be too slow to be of practical interest .",
    "this review will discuss relaxation processes beyond standard stellar relaxation , which operate on much shorter timescales , or else operate in a qualitatively different way : massive perturbers (  [ s : mp ] ) , strong mass segregation (  [ s : mseg ] ) and resonant relaxation (  [ s : rr ] ) .",
    "the dynamical properties of the gc , specifically its short 2-body relaxation time and high stellar density , are probably not typical of galaxies in general (  [ ss : gcdyn ] ) . however , dynamical processes that can be probed by gc observations have implications beyond the gc .",
    "in particular , the milky way is the archetype of the subset of galaxies with low - mass mbhs that are key targets for planned space - borne gravitational wave detectors , such as the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) .",
    "gc studies may help understand the effect of such relaxation processes on the open questions of the cosmic emri event rate and the emri orbital characteristics .    before turning to a discussion of the non - standard relaxation processes that are expected to operate in the gc , it is useful to briefly review the dynamics leading to close interactions with a mbh ( loss - cone theory ) and the dynamical conditions in the gc .",
    "stars can fall into the mbh either by losing orbital energy , so that the orbit shrinks down to the size of the last stable circular orbit ( @xmath1 for a non - rotating mbh , where the event horizon is at the schwarzschild radius @xmath2 ) , or by losing orbital angular momentum so that the orbit becomes nearly radial and unstable ( periapse @xmath3 for a star with zero orbital energy falling into a non - rotating mbh ) rather than the event horizon @xmath4 . ] .",
    "the timescale to lose energy by 2-body scattering , @xmath5 is of the order of the relaxation time , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of stars inside @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the dynamical time and spherical symmetry and a keplerian velocity dispersion are assumed , @xmath10 .",
    "the maximal angular momentum available for an orbit with energy @xmath11 is that of a circular orbit , @xmath12 ( using here the stellar dynamical sign convention @xmath13 ) . the timescale for losing angular momentum , @xmath14 , can be much shorter than @xmath15 when @xmath16 , since    close interactions with a mbh fall in two dynamical categories @xcite : infall processes , such as tidal disruption , where the star is destroyed promptly on its first close encounter with the mbh , and inspiral processes , such as gw emri events , where multiple consecutive close encounters are required for the orbit to gradually decay .",
    "the infall takes about an orbital period , the time to fall from the point of deflection to the center , whereas the inspiral process takes much longer , depending on the energy extraction efficiency of the dissipational mechanism involved ( for example gw emission , tidal heating or drag against a massive accretion disk ) . in most cases the dissipated energy is a steeply decreasing function of the the periapse @xcite .",
    "] and so the inspiral time scales with the number of periapse passages , and hence with the initial orbital period .",
    "an infall or inspiral event can occur only if the star , once deflected into the loss - cone , avoids being re - scattered out of it ( and in the case of inspiral , also avoids being scattered directly into the mbh ) . because inspiral processes are slow",
    ", stars can avoid re - scattering , complete the inspiral and decay to an interesting , very short period orbit with high emitted dissipative power , only if they are deflected into the loss cone from an initially short period orbit , with @xmath17 .",
    "figure ( [ f : rcrit ] ) shows a schematic description of the phase - space evolution of infalling and inspiraling stars , and the emergence of a critical energy scale .",
    "for inspiral by gw emission into a @xmath18 mbh , @xmath19 corresponds to an initial distance scale of @xmath20 pc ( the _ ansatz _ @xmath21 is assumed here @xmath22 ) .",
    "the emri event rate is then approximately @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of potential gw sources ( compact remnants ) within distance @xmath8 of the mbh .",
    "a critical energy can be similarly defined for infall processes . because infall is much faster than inspiral , @xmath19 is much lower ( @xmath25 much larger ) .",
    "for example , the critical radius for tidal disruption in the gc is @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "most of the stars that infall or inspiral originate near @xmath25 .    equation ( [ e : glc ] ) shows that the degree of central concentration of compact remnants strongly affects the emri event rate .",
    "mass segregation therefore substantially increases the predicted emri event rate from inspiraling @xmath27 stellar black holes ( sbhs ) , which are the most massive , long - lived objects in the population ( @xcite ;  [ s : mseg ] ) .",
    "similarly , the capture of compact remnants very near the mbh by 3-body exchanges between the mbh and binaries (  [ s : mp ] ) can also strongly affect the emri rate ( perets , hopman & alexander , 2007 , in prep . ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath28 on @xmath29 is not trivial , since @xmath25 itself depends on @xmath29 : the shorter the relaxation time , the faster stars are scattered into the loss - cone , but also out of it .",
    "detailed analysis shows that the two effects cancel out for @xmath30 stellar cusps . since in most galactic nuclei",
    "the logarithmic slope of the density profile is not much different from @xmath31 , the emri rate is expected to be roughly independent of the relaxation time @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that this result applies only to 2-body relaxation , and needs to be re - examined if other loss - cone replenishment mechanisms dominate the dynamics .    [",

    "the effect of 2-body relaxation on a test star is incoherent : the star experiences randomly oriented , uncorrelated perturbations from the ambient stars , and as a result its orbit deviates in a random - walk fashion from its original phase - space coordinates ( in a stationary spherical smoothed potential where @xmath11 and @xmath32 would have been conserved in the continuum limit , @xmath33 and @xmath34 due to 2-body interactions ) .",
    "resonant relaxation ( rr ) @xcite is a form of accelerated relaxation of the orbital angular momentum , which occurs when approximate symmetries in the potential restrict the orbital evolution of the perturbing stars .",
    "this happens in the almost keplerian potential near a mbh , where the orbits are approximately fixed ellipses ( the potential of the enclosed stellar mass far from the mbh , or general relativistic ( gr ) precession near the mbh , eventually leads to deviations from pure elliptical orbits ) , or in a non - keplerian , but nearly spherically symmetric potential around a mbh , where the orbits approximately conserve their angular momentum and move on rosette - like planar orbits ( the fluctuations in the potential due to stellar motions eventually lead to deviations from strictly planar orbits ) .",
    "as long as the symmetry is approximately conserved , on times shorter than the coherence timescale @xmath35 , the orbit of a test star with semi - major axis @xmath22 experiences correlated ( coherent ) perturbations , which can be described as a constant residual torque exerted by the superposed potentials of the @xmath36 randomly oriented elliptical `` mass wires '' ( in a keplerian potential ) or `` mass annuli '' ( in a non - keplerian spherical potential ) that represent the orbitally - averaged mass distribution of individual perturbing stars .",
    "the magnitude of the residual torque is then @xmath37 and the change in the angular momentum of the test star increases linearly with time , @xmath38 ( for @xmath39 ) .",

    "this is where gr precession is predicted to play an important role @xcite .",
    "orbits with very small periapse , @xmath97 , where gw emission becomes appreciable , are also orbits where the gr precession rate becomes large enough ( @xmath66 becomes short enough ) to quench rr , and allow the emri inspiral to proceed undisturbed .",

    "such calculations show that the poorly determined value of the efficiency can strongly affect the predicted emri rates ( fig .",

    "dynamical populations and structures whose estimated age exceed these relaxation timescales must be relaxed .",
    "those whose age can not be determined , but whose lifespan exceeds the relaxation timescales may be affected , unless we are observing them at an atypical time soon after they were created .",
    "the youngest dynamical structure observed in the gc is the stellar disk ( or possibly two non - aligned disks ) @xcite , which is composed of @xmath115 young massive ob stars with an age of @xmath116 myr , on co - planar , co - rotating orbits that extend between @xmath117@xmath118 pc .",
    "the inner edge of the disk is sharply defined and it coincides with the outer boundary of the s - stars cluster (  [ ss : mp_gc ] ) . figure ( [ f : gc_rr ] ) shows that the vector rr timescale equals the age of the stellar disk at its inner edge , and so is consistent with the spatial extent of the disk .",
    "even if the s - stars were initially the inner part of the disk ( this does not appear likely given that they are systematically lighter than the disk stars ) , vector rr would have efficiently randomized their orbital inclination .",
    "however , their measured high eccentricities @xcite would then be hard to explain . if instead , the s - stars are not - related to the disks , but were tidally captured around the mbh by 3-body exchange interactions (  [ ss : mp_imp ] ) , then only their lifespan can be determined .",
    "tidal capture leads to an extremely eccentric captured orbit ( eq . [ e : acapture ] ) .",
    "scalar rr could then randomize and decrease the eccentricities of at least a few of the older s - stars closer to the mbh .",

    "it should be noted that the effect of rr on the stellar density distribution is not expected to be large even quite close to the mbh ( @xmath122 pc ) , unless the efficiency @xmath99 is very high , because the rr - induced depletion of the df at high energies is smoothed by the transformation from the df to @xmath123 ( eq .

    "three processes beyond minimal two - body relaxation were discussed here : accelerated loss - cone replenishment by mps , strong mass - segregation in evolved populations , and rapid rr .",
    "evidence was presented that these processes operate and may even dominate relaxation and its consequences in the gc : the s - stars and hvss are consistent with relaxation by gmcs ; there are hints for strong mass segregation in the central density suppression of the low - mass red clump giants and in numeric simulations of the gc , and rr appears to play a role in the truncation of the stellar disks and the orbital randomization of the s - stars and the late type giants .",
    "there are also cosmic implications : mps enable the efficient merger of binary mbhs , and boost the rates of white dwarf emris captured near the mbh by tidal disruptions of stellar binaries . strong segregation , and in particular rr can strongly affect the emri rates from stellar bhs ."
