    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) describes the strong interactions of hadrons in terms of the interactions of their quark and gluon constituents .",
    "the qcd lagrangian @xmath1 for @xmath2 flavors of quarks has a large global symmetry in the limit when @xmath3 .",
    "this symmetry corresponds to the freedom of arbitrary chiral rotations of the @xmath2 flavor of quarks into each other . because @xmath4with @xmath5 being the dynamical scale of the theory  in practice only a chiral @xmath6 symmetry is actually a very good approximate global symmetry of the strong interactions .",
    "this symmetry , however , is not manifest in the spectrum of hadrons .",
    "it is instructive to understand why this is so .",
    "the @xmath7 subgroup of the @xmath6 symmetry , corresponding to vectorial ( v = r+l ) baryon number , is an exact symmetry of qcd , irrespective of the value of the quark masses . in the limit of @xmath8",
    "a further @xmath9 subgroup would be an exact ( isospin ) symmetry of qcd . because the @xmath10- and @xmath11-quark masses are so light compared to @xmath5 ,",
    "even with @xmath12 one has an approximately degenerate multiplet of hadrons corresponding to this symmetry ( e.g. the @xmath13-triplet and the doublet of neutrons and protons ) .",
    "however , the corresponding axial symmetries in @xmath6 ( @xmath14 ) are not seen in the spectrum .",
    "for instance , there are no parity doublets degenerate with the neutron and proton .",
    "this phenomena is understood because the @xmath15 symmetry is not preserved by the qcd vacuum .",
    "indeed , as is appropriate for a spontaneously broken global symmetry , there is instead in the qcd hadron spectrum an approximate triplet of nambu - goldstone bosons  the pions  whose mass vanishes in the limit that @xmath16 .",
    "remarkably , however , there is no corresponding pseudoscalar state with vanishing mass , in the same limit , corresponding to the nambu - goldstone boson of a @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the nature of the approximate @xmath17 symmetry of the strong interactions was actually understood before the advent of qcd@xcite .",
    "although the anomalous features of the @xmath18 symmetry were also pinpointed around the time of the development of qcd as the theory of the strong interactions@xcite , the resolution of the @xmath18 problem required a better understanding of the qcd vacuum . in short ,",
    "the reason why there are no approximate nambu - goldstone bosons associated with this abelian chiral symmetry is that , as a result of chiral anomaly@xcite , this is really * not * a quantum symmetry of qcd . in turn , however , this more complete understanding opens up another problem  the strong cp problem@xcite .",
    "namely , the richer vacuum of qcd , combined with the violation of cp in the weak interactions , allows for the presence of an effective interaction @xmath19 which leads to an enormous neutron electric dipole moment @xmath20 $ ] , unless the parameter @xmath21 is tiny @xmath22 .",
    "in qcd , the dynamical formation of quark condensates , @xmath23 , breaks the @xmath24 global symmetry . as a result ,",
    "in the limit of vanishing quark masses , the pion triplet are the nambu goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneously broken @xmath15 current @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the @xmath27 doublet of quark fields .",
    "the existence of these massless states produces a @xmath28 pole in the green s functions of the @xmath15 currents with pseudoscalar quark densities .",
    "one has @xmath29 because the @xmath30 condensates also break the @xmath18 global symmetry , naively one expects also a similar @xmath31 singularity associated with the @xmath18 current , connected to a further nambu - goldstone boson  the @xmath32 in this 2-flavor discussion .",
    "however , such an approximate nambu - goldstone excitation can not really exist , since if it did , it would lead ( in the limit of finite but small quark masses ) to a state essentially degenerate with the pions@xcite  in contradiction with experiment .",
    "the situation is a bit more complicated because the @xmath18 current @xmath33 has a chiral anomaly@xcite @xmath34 however , since the rhs of the above equation is a total divergence@xcite @xmath35~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can construct a conserved chiral current @xmath36 as a result , in the massless quark limit , if @xmath37 , one can show that the green s functions of the @xmath38 current have a @xmath28 singularity analogous to that of the chiral @xmath15 currents : @xmath39 the @xmath18 problem , then , is why such a singularity is not manifested physically in the spectrum of hadrons ?",
    "the resolution of the @xmath18 problem came from a better understanding of the structure of the qcd vacuum . for",
    "gauge fields one can take the vacuum state to be the state where the vector potential is either zero or is in a gauge configuration equivalent to zero .",
    "a proper study of these configurations reveals that the structure of the vacuum state for non - abelian gauge theories ( like qcd ) is richer than expected .",
    "following callan , dashen , and gross@xcite it is convenient to study these theories in the temporal gauge @xmath40 and concentrate on an @xmath41 subgroup . with this gauge choice ,",
    "the spatial gauge fields are time independent and under a gauge transformation transform as @xmath42 thus , in this gauge , vacuum configurations corresponds to a vanishing vector potential , or to @xmath43 .    the rich vacuum structure of qcd results from the requirement that the gauge transformation matrices @xmath44 go to unity at spatial infinity .",
    "such a requirement maps the physical space onto the group space and this @xmath45 map splits @xmath44 into different homotopy classes @xmath46 , characterized by an integer winding number @xmath47 detailing how precisely @xmath44 behaves as @xmath48 : @xmath49 the winding number @xmath47 is related to the jacobian of the @xmath50 transformation @xmath51 with @xmath52 being the pure gauge field corresponding to the gauge transformation matrix @xmath53 .    because one can construct the @xmath47-gauge transformation matrix @xmath53 by compounding @xmath47 times @xmath54",
    ", it follows that the vacuum state corresponding to @xmath55 is not really gauge invariant .",
    "indeed , the action of the gauge transformation matrix @xmath56 on an @xmath47-vacuum state gives an @xmath57-vacuum state @xmath58 nevertheless , one can construct a gauge - invariant vacuum state  the , so called , @xmath59-vacuum  by superposing these @xmath47-vacua@xcite @xmath60 indeed , it is easy to check that @xmath61 .    because of this more complex vacuum structure , the vacuum functional for the theory splits into distinct sectors . @xmath62~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this superposition of transition amplitudes from @xmath63 to @xmath64 with fixed @xmath47-vacuum difference @xmath65 , weighted by different phases @xmath66 introduces an additional intrinsic source of cp violation . by using eqs .",

    "perturbation theory is connected to the @xmath71 sectors where the @xmath72 term vanishes .",
    "the effects of the @xmath73 sectors thus necessarily are nonperturbative .",
    "these contributions are naturally selected by the connection of @xmath72 to the chiral anomaly . for @xmath74 flavors ,",
    "the axial current @xmath75 has an anomaly @xmath76 thus a chirality change @xmath77 is related to @xmath65 as : @xmath78 the solution to the @xmath18 problem is connected to the chirality breakdown in qcd in the @xmath73 sectors . if these sectors are included  as they should  then @xmath79 is * never * a symmetry .    for @xmath80 ,",
    "the conserved current discussed earlier @xmath81 is not gauge invariant for transformations with non - trivial winding number .",
    "one can show@xcite that the associated chiral charge @xmath82 transforms as @xmath83 when one worries about @xmath73 sectors .",
    "t hooft showed that it is this lack of gauge invariance which is crucial to resolve the @xmath18 problem@xcite .",
    "although green s functions of the @xmath38 currents contain @xmath84 singularities , these singularities are cancelled for the corresponding green s functions of the gauge invariant currents @xmath75 .",
    "the green s function for this current with a pseudoscalar density obeys the equation @xmath85 although the first term above is singular at @xmath28 , when one considers the effects of @xmath73 sectors , so is the second term .",
    "these singularities * cancel * for the green s function of the physical current @xmath75@xcite . because of eq .",
    "( 19 ) , the @xmath18 symmetry is really not a symmetry at all .",
    "therefore , not surprisingly , there are really no physical nambu goldstone bosons associated with this pseudo symmetry !",
    "the effective interaction ( 17 ) is not the only new source of cp violation arising from the more complex structure of the qcd vacuum .",
    "it is augmented by an analogous term coming from the electroweak sector of the theory .",
    "the origin of this additional interaction is as follows . in general , the mass matrix of quarks which emerges from the spontaneous breakdown of the electroweak gauge symmetry is neither hermitian nor diagonal : @xmath86 this matrix can be diagonalized by separate unitary transformations of the chiral quark fields .",
    "these transformations encompass a chiral @xmath18 transformation @xmath87 with @xmath88 . such chiral transformations , in effect , change the vacuum angle@xcite .",
    "that this is so follows from eq .",
    "( 21 ) . using this equation ( replacing the factor of 2 by the number of flavors @xmath74 ) ,",
    "it is easy to see that a chiral @xmath18 rotation on the @xmath59 vacuum shifts the vacuum angle by arg det @xmath89@xcite : @xmath90    the strong cp problem is really why the combination of qcd and electroweak parameters which make up @xmath21 should be so small . as we remarked upon earlier , the effective interaction ( 2 ) gives a direct contribution to the electric dipole moment of the neutron and the strong experimental bound on @xmath91 requires that @xmath92@xcite . in principle , because @xmath21 is a free parameter in the theory , any value of @xmath21 is equally likely .",
    "however , one would like to obtain an understanding from some underlying physics of why this number is so small .",
    "almost twenty years ago , helen quinn and i@xcite suggested a dynamical solution to the strong cp problem .",
    "what we postulated was that the * full * lagrangian of the standard model was invariant under an additional global chiral @xmath93 symmetry .",
    "if this @xmath94 symmetry existed , and it were exact , the strong cp problem would be trivially solved since @xmath21 could be set to zero through such a chiral transformation ( cf .",
    ". however , physically such a symmetry can not be exact .",
    "nevertheless , what quinn and i@xcite showed was that , even if @xmath94 is spontaneously broken , the parameter @xmath21 is dynamically driven to zero .",
    "however , in this case there is an associated pseudo nambu - goldstone boson in the theory , the axion@xcite .",
    "symmetry is anomalous . as a result",
    ", the axion gets a mass of order @xmath95 , where @xmath2 is the scale associated with the breakdown of the @xmath94 symmetry . ]",
    "it is useful to understand schematically how a global @xmath94 symmetry solves the strong cp problem@xcite .",
    "basically , what happens is that by incorporating this symmetry in the theory one replaces the static cp violating parameter @xmath21 by the dynamical ( cp conserving ) interactions of the axion field @xmath96 . because the axion field is the nambu - goldstone boson associated with the spontaneously broken @xmath94 symmetry",
    ", this field translates under a @xmath94 transformation .",
    "if @xmath97 is the phase parameter of this transformation and @xmath2 is the scale associated with the breakdown of the symmetry , one has @xmath98 it follows , therefore , that if the effective lagrangian describing the full theory is to be @xmath94 invariant , the axion field must only enter derivatively coupled .",
    "this statement would be exactly true if the @xmath94 symmetry were not anomalous .",
    "because of the chiral anomaly , however , @xmath99 must also have a term in which the axion field couples directly to the gluon density @xmath72 , so as to guarantee that @xmath100 has the correct qcd chiral anomaly .",
    "the above considerations fix the form of the effective standard model lagrangian , if it is augmented by an extra @xmath94 global symmetry as we suggested@xcite . focusing only on the extra terms involving the axion field",

    "thus its vacuum expectation is no longer arbitrary .",
    "indeed the minimum of this potential determines the axion field vev @xmath105 .",
    "one has @xmath106 what quinn and i showed@xcite is that the periodicity of the pseudoscalar density expectation value @xmath107 in the relevant @xmath59-parameter , @xmath108 , forces the axion vev to take the value @xmath109 this solves the strong cp problem , since @xmath110 , when expressed in terms of the physical axion field , @xmath111 , no longer contains the cp violating @xmath112 term . furthermore",
    ", expanding @xmath113 at its minimum , one sees that the axion itself gets a mass : @xmath114 therefore , the standard model with an additional @xmath94 symmetry no longer has a dangerous cp violating interaction .",
    "instead , it contains additional interactions of a massive axion field both with matter and gluons characterized by a scale @xmath2 : @xmath115 - \\frac{1}{2 } \\partial^\\mu a_{\\rm phys . }",

    "thus the contribution of axion oscillations to the universe energy density today is of order @xmath250\\left[\\frac{r^3(t^*)}{r^3}\\right ] \\sim \\frac{\\lambda^3_{\\rm qcd } t^3}{m_a m_{\\rm planck}}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath251 is the temperature of the universe today . requiring that @xmath252",
    "be less than the closure density of the universe provides the lower bound on @xmath218 .",
    "amazingly , the above order of magnitude formula gives the same bounds on @xmath218 that the more careful calculations give@xcite @xmath253",
    "the cosmological and astrophysical constraints on invisible axions allow only a rather narrow window for the axion mass , roughly @xmath254 if the axion has a mass near the lower limit , then axions play a very important role in the universe and could be ( part of ) the universe s cold dark matter .",
    "the cosmological bounds are subject to caveats , so it is useful to explore all masses below @xmath255 . for instance , decay of axionic strings@xcite may increase the contribution of axions to the present universe s energy density by about a factor of @xmath256thereby pushing the axion mass lower bound to the astrophysical limit . on the other hand , linde@xcite has argued that in inflationary models , it is quite possible that @xmath257 , with @xmath258 . this would decrease the lower bound on the axion mass by a factor of @xmath259 .    these uncertainties notwithstanding , it is very worthwhile trying to detect a possible signal of invisible axions .",
    "indeed , experiments are presently under way to try to detect such axions on the assumption that they constitute the dark matter component of our galactic halo . under this assumption",
    "one can estimate both the presumed axion energy density , @xmath260 , and their velocity , @xmath261the virial velocity in the galaxy .",
    "the basic idea for these experiments was suggested more than a decade ago by sikivie@xcite .",
    "it makes use of the axion to 2-photon coupling to resonantly convert in a laboratory magnetic field the halo axions into photons , which can then be detected in a cavity .    the interaction of halo axions with a constant magnetic field @xmath262 in a resonant cavity , as a result of eq .",
    "( 37 ) , produces an electric field with frequency @xmath263 .",
    "the generated electromagnetic energy can be detected in the cavity . when the cavity is tuned to the axion frequency",
    ", one should observe a narrow line on top of the noise spectrum . on resonance",
    ", one can write for the axion to photon conversion power the expression@xcite @xmath264[vb_o^2 ] \\left[\\frac{\\alpha}{\\pi f } k_{a\\gamma\\gamma}\\right]^2 c_{\\rm over } q_{\\rm eff}~.\\ ] ] here the first factor is just the number of axions per unit volume ; the second details the magnetic energy ; the third is the axion coupling strength @xmath265 ; the fourth is an overlap factor of @xmath124 which depends in detail on which mode is excited in the cavity .",
    "finally the last factor is the effective @xmath266 for the experiment , which is the minimum of the cavity s @xmath266 and that produced by the spread in the axion frequency due to its velocity .",
    "typically both numbers are of @xmath267 .",
    "halo axions produce microwave photons @xmath268 .",
    "two pilot experiments , done at brookhaven@xcite and the university of florida@xcite had limited  magnetic energy \"",
    "typically @xmath269and relatively noisy amplifiers .",
    "these experiments set limits for @xmath270 about a factor of 100 - 1000 away from theoretical expectations .",
    "there are now , however , two second generation experiments which should be sensitive at , or near , the theoretical limits .",
    "the first of these experiments , which has just started taking data , is being carried out at livermore national lab@xcite .",
    "it has a very large magnetic volume @xmath271 and state of the art amplifiers to reduce the noise level ! ] .",
    "the second experiment , to be carried out in kyoto university@xcite , uses a rather moderate magnetic volume @xmath272 .",
    "however , it employs an extremely clever technique for counting the produced photons using rydberg atoms , which is extremely sensitive .",
    "i show in the figure the expectations of these experiments , along with the limits obtained by the pilot experiments .",
    "it is clear that these experiments have the capability to answer the question of the existence of axions in the mass range that they can probe .",
    "results are expected in the next few years .",
    "so , stay tuned !",
