    "an important source of information about the nucleon internal structure is the properties of nucleon excitation states @xmath4 s , such as their mass spectrum , various production and decay rates@xcite .",
    "our present knowledge of this aspect came almost entirely from partial - wave analyses of @xmath6 total , elastic , and charge - exchange scattering data of more than twenty years ago@xcite . since the late 1970 s , very little has happened in experimental @xmath4 baryon spectroscopy .",
    "considering its importance for the understanding of the baryon structure and for distinguishing various pictures @xcite of the nonperturbative regime of qcd , a new generation of experiments on @xmath4 physics with electromagnetic probes has recently been started at new facilities such as cebaf at jlab , elsa at bonn , graal at grenoble .",
    "a long - standing problem in @xmath4 physics is about the nature of the roper resonance @xmath13 . in simple three - quark picture of baryons",
    ", it should be the first radial excitation state of the nucleon .",
    "but various quark models@xcite met difficulties to explain its mass and electromagnetic couplings .",
    "it has therefore been suggested@xcite to be a gluonic excitation state of the nucleon , i.e. , a  hybrid baryon \" . to establish the gluonic degree of freedom in hadrons",
    "is a fascinating challenge in nowadays non - perturbative qcd physics .",
    "although the existence of the @xmath13 is well - established , its properties , such as mass , width and decay branching ratios etc .",
    ", still suffer large experimental uncertainties@xcite .",
    "a big problem in extracting information on the @xmath13 from @xmath6 and @xmath7 experiments is the isospin decomposition of 1/2 and 3/2 @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by one of us@xcite , the decays of @xmath17 and @xmath18 provide an ideal place for studying the properties of @xmath4 resonances , since in these processes the @xmath2 and @xmath3 systems are limited to be pure isospin 1/2 due to isospin conservation .",
    "preliminary results from the bes collaboration on @xmath19 show a clear peak structure around 1490 mev in its @xmath2 invariant mass spectrum@xcite .",
    "the process @xmath8 or @xmath9 also provides a new way to probe the internal quark - gluon structure of the @xmath4 resonances . in the simple three - quark picture of baryons , the process can be described by fig.1 @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "three quark - antiquark pairs are created independently via a symmetric three - gluon intermediate state with no extra interaction other than the recombination process in the final state to form baryons .",
    "this is quite different from the mechanism underlying the @xmath4 production from the @xmath20 process where the photon couples to only one quark and unsymmetric configuration of quarks is favored .",
    "therefore the processes @xmath8 and @xmath21 should probe different aspects of the quark distributions inside baryons . since the @xmath5 decay is a glue - rich process , a hybrid @xmath4 is expected to have larger production rate than a pure three - quark @xmath4@xcite .",
    "if @xmath13 is a pure three - quark baryon , @xmath22 should have the same feynman diagram fig.1 as for @xmath10 .",
    "the only difference for the two processes is their quark wave functions and masses .",
    "here we perform a calculation of the ratio between production rates of two processes by assuming simple three - quark wave functions for them . by comparing with experimental data",
    ", we can see whether the @xmath13 is produced more than the quark model prediction .",
    "for the basic amplitude corresponding to fig.1 , we have    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the polarization four - vector of @xmath5 with the helicity value @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the four - vector momentum of @xmath5 , @xmath27 are the four - vector momenta and spin z - projection of quarks ( anti - quarks ) , respectively .",
    "we have put all color matrix elements , qcd strong coupling constants , @xmath5 decay constants , etc .",
    ", into a single overall constant @xmath28 .",
    "the relation between the @xmath29 amplitude and the basic quark diagram amplitude eq.(1 ) is @xmath30 is the product of quark model wave functions of @xmath31 and @xmath32 in momentum space , with constraints @xmath33 .",
    "the only difference between quark wave functions of the proton and @xmath13 is their spatial parts , which we assume to be simple harmonic - oscillator eigenfunctions in their center - of - mass ( cm ) systems , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath34 e^{-{1\\over 2\\alpha}(\\vec k^2_\\rho+\\vec k^2_\\lambda ) } \\quad for \\quad n^*(1440)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the harmonic - oscillator parameter , @xmath36 with @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 the three quark momenta in the cm system of their corresponding baryon , which are related to @xmath40 or @xmath41 by a lorentz transformation .    in the @xmath5 at rest system ,",
    "the two baryon clusters are moving in opposite directions with highly relativistic speeds , each becoming very flat .",
    "their spatial quark wave functions in this system are related to their cm wave functions as follows@xcite :    @xmath42    where @xmath43    the spin and flavor wavefunctions of the proton and @xmath13 are the same , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the mixed - symmetry pair spin-@xmath47 wavefunctions .",
    "for example , we have @xmath48 for the case of the total spin @xmath47 and its projection @xmath47 .",
    "the flavor wavefunctions @xmath49 and @xmath50 are exactly analogous to that of the spin wavefunctions but in isospin space of @xmath51-@xmath52 quarks .",
    "we perform the calculation in the @xmath5 rest system . for @xmath5",
    "produced in @xmath53 annihilation , its helicity is limited to be @xmath54 . the components in eq.(1 ) can be expressed more explicitly as @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the energy and mass of the quark .    in eq.(2 )",
    ", the integration over @xmath58 with two @xmath59 functions can be reduced to a ten - dimension integration which we carry out numerically with the adaptive multidimensional monte - carlo integration program riwiad of cern program library . from these amplitudes",
    "@xmath60 , we can get the decay cross section for @xmath61 as @xmath62 with @xmath63 as the solid angle of @xmath64 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath65 is similar , just replacing quark radial wavefunction of the anti - proton by that of the @xmath66 . with formulas above ,",
    "the calculation of the decay cross sections is straightforward though tedious .",
    "in our quark model calculation , there are three parameters , _",
    "i.e. _ , the constituent quark mass @xmath57 , the harmonic - oscillator parameter @xmath67 and an overall normalization factor @xmath28 .",
    "the relation between @xmath67 and the nucleon radius @xmath68 is @xmath69 . in most quark model calculations@xcite",
    ", the quark mass @xmath57 has been chosen in the range of @xmath70 mev , and @xmath67 in the range of @xmath71 which corresponds to the nucleon radius in the range of @xmath72 fm . in the following ,",
    "we limit our parameters in these ranges .",
    "the @xmath5 decay cross sections for @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 can be expressed as @xmath76 here @xmath77 is a constant direct related to the experimental branching ratio of @xmath10 and can be used to fix the overall normalization constant @xmath28 .",
    "the experimental value for @xmath78 is ( @xmath79)@xcite and can be used to put further limit on the range of parameters @xmath67 and @xmath57 .",
    "the shaded area in fig.[fig2 ] shows the range allowed by one standard deviation of the experimental @xmath78 value .    in order to investigate the importance of the lorentz contraction effect ,",
    "we have also performed the calculation by ignoring this effect , _",
    "i.e. _ , assuming @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the resulted ( @xmath67 , @xmath57 ) area allowed by one standard deviation of the experimental @xmath78 value is shown in fig.[fig2 ] by the area surrounded by the solid line .",
    "one can see that the lorentz contraction effect is very large and can not be ignored .    with ( @xmath67 , @xmath57 ) values in the shaded area of fig.[fig2 ] ,",
    "our quark model calculation predicts @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "mixings between the ground state and the radially excited states@xcite will not change our result much due to the relative negative sign of mixings for the proton and @xmath13 .",
    "there are no experimental data on @xmath74 and @xmath12 channels yet .",
    "however from both besi@xcite and markii@xcite experiments , there is a clear peak around 1.5 gev in the @xmath6 invariant mass in @xmath86 processes , although no partial wave analyses were performed .",
    "very recently besii has finished data - taking for 50 million more @xmath87 events , which is about two order of manitude more statistics than markii data and one order of magnitude more statistics than besi data . with such statistics , partial wave analyses of relevant channels",
    "are possible .",
    "new experimental results on @xmath10 , @xmath8 and @xmath88 will help us to narrow down the quark model @xmath89 parameters and study the nature of @xmath4 .",
    "if the @xmath8 production rate is significantly larger than our quark model prediction , it may indicate that the @xmath4 is a hybrid@xcite ; if @xmath8 production rate is significantly smaller than our prediction , then it may indicate that the @xmath4 contains a large component of @xmath6 in its internal structure@xcite . for a more quantitative statement ,",
    "concrete theoretical calculations for hybrid and molecule baryon production are needed .",
