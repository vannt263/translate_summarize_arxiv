    "photomultiplier tubes ( pmt ) are used in many areas of basic science research and in commercial instruments for detection of low intensity light .",
    "especially , nuclear and particle physics experiments have used pmts to detect even a single photon .",
    "pmts are used to measure scintillation lights from various scintillators and the energy deposition in the scintillator can be measured by integrating the charge of photoelectrons generated in the photocathode of the pmts .",
    "afterpulse which occurs some time after the initial photoelectron signal is one of the main sources of undesired background noise signals .",
    "the mechanism of afterpulse has been studied ever since pmts were used in the scientific research and the technology to reduce the afterpulse was critical to the pmt industry @xcite .",
    "one of the main mechanisms generating the afterpulse was found to be the ionization of the residual gases by the accelerated photoelectrons occurring inside the pmt @xcite .",
    "the positive ions produced by the ionization are accelerated in the electric field towards the photocathode and generate an afterpulse upon the impact on the photocathode .",
    "another mechanism of the afterpulse is the back - scattered electrons at the pmt dynodes returning to the dynode after traveling for a while inside the pmt .    for experiments to measure very rare events , such as direct dark matter searches or low energy neutrino experiments , pmt s afterpulse can be a significant source of the background",
    "since the signals in these experiments are typically small and the event rate is very low . up to now",
    ", the afterpulse has been studied mainly with a conventional electronics such as a gated analogue to digital converter ( adc ) or a multihit tdc . for afterpulses occurring at wide range of time",
    ", the timing of the afterpulses was not studied in detail . in this report",
    ", we describe a detailed study on both the precise time and the amplitude of the afterpulses measured with a 400 mhz flash adc ( fadc ) .",
    "the offline analysis of the wide range of the waveform enables the detailed studies on the mechanism of the afterpulse .",
    "for this measurement , a 400 mhz fadc module has been used to store the waveform of the pmt signal .",
    "photons were generated by a light source made with a blue led which was triggered by a short pulse from an electric pulse generator .",
    "the pulse width was 10 ns and the height of the pulse has been varied to control the light intensity from the led .",
    "we have tested a 10 inch hemispherical pmt(r7081 by hamamatsu ) , which is being considered as photon detector for a planned reactor neutrino oscillation experiment @xcite .",
    "the voltage divider of the pmt is shown in figure [ basedrawing ] .",
    "the total resistance of the base was 12.7 and the division ratio in the dynodes resistance chain was ( 16.8 - 0.6 - 3.4 - 5 - 3.33 - 1.67 - 1 - 1.2 - 1.5 - 2.2 - 3 - 2.4 ) .",
    "the voltage difference between the photocathode and the dynode is 622v for an applied voltage of 1550 v.        the fadc module was triggered by the pulse generator which provided light in the led .",
    "the duration of one event was 20.48 ( 8192 bin and 2.5 ns per bin ) . to obtain the single photoelectron spectrum ,",
    "the light intensity was adjusted so that there is about one signal out of 10 led trigger events .",
    "the starting time of the led light signal was about 4 in 20.48 length for one event . since the pulse width was only 10 ns , the main pulse occurred in the window of 50 ns , and the charge from the main pulse",
    "was obtained by integrating the charge centered at the maximum signal height of the pulse with the integration time window of 40 ns .",
    "the afterpulse was searched in the time window of 300 ns - 15 after the initial pulse .",
    "first , the local maximum was searched and the 40 ns charge integration was performed for one afterpulse .",
    "to study the mechanism of the various groups of afterpulses , different high voltage ( hv ) has been applied on the pmt .",
    "the applied hv was varied from 1350 v to 1750 v. for each hv supply , a single photoelectron ( spe ) spectrum was obtained and the peak position gives the mean charge of single photoelectron . then the number of photoelectrons ( npe ) in the main pulse and each afterpulse was determined by dividing the charge of each pulse with the spe charge .",
    "the spe spectra for the three different high voltages are shown in figure [ spe ] .",
    "the peak to valley ratio was 2.5 at 1350 v and more than 4 at 1750 v.    table [ hvtable ] lists the high voltages applied , the spe charge , and the mean number of photoelectrons in the main led light pulse .",
    "a slight increase has been observed in the number of photoelectrons for higher high voltages .",
    "this may be due to the higher electron collection efficiency .",
    "as discussed in section [ timingsection ] , the ap1 afterpulse can be ascribed to ( proton ) because has the least @xmath0 among possible ions .",
    "the time distribution of the afterpulse is about 6 ns in sigma , and such a sharpness is difficult to understand .",
    "the arrival time of calculated with eq.(3 ) is 0.91 for the applied voltage of 1550 v which is far from the measured value of 0.49 @xmath1 .",
    "if the ionization occurs between the photocathode and the dynode , the arrival time can not be so sharp since the actual potential distribution would be different from the assumed potential distribution of eq .",
    "one possible explanation would be that ap1 afterpulse was due to the generated at the dynode with the adsorbed @xmath2 on the dynode .",
    "we need a detail map of the electric potential inside the pmt to clarify the issue of the sharpness of the afterpulse .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the timing , amplitude , and the rate of pmt afterpulse for a wide range of the arrival times in detail .",
    "the time and amplitude correlation of the afterpulse shows several distinctive groups . the afterpulse with single photoelectron amplitude",
    "was observed as separated from other large amplitude afterpulse for the first time .",
    "the afterpulse potentially assigned as showed a time width less than 10 ns .",
    "the amplitude and normalized rate of ion impact afterpulse does not depend on the main pulse amplitude in the range of up to 45 photoelectrons .",
