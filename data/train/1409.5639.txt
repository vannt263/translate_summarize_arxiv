    "however qcd still lacks good understanding of quark - gluon interactions at large distances , or low moment transfers , mostly due to the mathematical complexity of the theory and the non - applicability of perturbative methods at this range .",

    "the diphoton production cross - sections check the validity of next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) pqcd predictions , soft - gluon resummation methods implemented in theoretical calculations , and contributions from the parton - to - photon fragmentation diagrams .",

    "the cross section measurements for inclusive jet and dijet production ( see section [ sec : jets ] ) were no longer limited by statistical uncertainties and resulting systematic uncertainties were comparable to uncertainties from theoretical predictions .",
    "this improvement revealed significant flexibility in parton distribution functions , especially for large @xmath9 gluons , and motivated inclusion of the tevatron jet data in the global pdf analyses to constrain gluon distributions@xcite , thus making predictions more precise , particularly in processes where gluon - quark scattering dominates .",
    "qcd predictions were tested further by comparing with the measurements of the ratio of inclusive jet cross sections at @xmath11= 630 and 1800 gev , dijet cross sections at large rapidity , and a set of photon and photon+jet final state measurements ( see section [ seq : gamma ] ) for both @xmath11=1800 gev and @xmath11=630 gev .",
