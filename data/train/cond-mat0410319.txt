    "liquid foams , like colloids , emulsions , polymer or surfactant solutions , are characterised by a complex mechanical behaviour .",
    "these systems , known as soft complex systems , are multiphasic materials .",
    "their constitutive entities are in interaction , generating internal structures , which cause diverse rheological behaviour @xcite .",
    "liquid foams are convenient model experimental system for studying the interplay between structure and rheology , since their internal structure can be easily visualised and manipulated .",
    "liquid foams are made of polyhedral gas bubbles separated by thin liquid boundaries forming a connected network .",
    "the liquid phase occupies a small fraction of the volume of the foam ( a few percent for a dry foam ) .",
    "the deformations and motions of liquid foams are very diverse : foams are elastic , plastic or viscous depending on the applied strain and strain rate @xcite .",
    "this behaviour has been shown in rheological experiments performed on three - dimensional ( 3d ) foams @xcite ; models have been built to account for this diversity of rheological behaviour @xcite .",
    "however , the visualisation of the foam structure is technically difficult in 3d @xcite , although progresses have been made recently @xcite .",
    "moreover , the drainage of the liquid phase due to gravity may occur in 3d , making the fluid fraction and therefore the rheological moduli of the foam , as well as bubble size ( through coarsening ) inhomogeneous @xcite .",
    "for all these reasons , the mechanics of foams has been studied in two dimensions , where the direct visualisation of the structure is easier , and no gravity - driven drainage occurs if the system is horizontal .",
    "the system is then either a true 2d system ( unlike bubble raft @xcite ) , like a langmuir foam @xcite , or a quasi 2d system constituted by a monolayer of bubbles , either confined between two horizontal transparent plates ( hele - shaw cells @xcite : incompressible foams , see below ) or between the surface of the solution and an upper horizontal transparent plate @xcite ( compressible foams , see below ) . the deformation and motion of individual cells have been forced and studied in different flow geometries : simple shear @xcite , flow in a constriction or around an obstacle @xcite , couette flow @xcite .",
    "some authors have been particularly interested in the dynamics of bubble rearrangements during the flow : the spatial distribution of the rearrangements @xcite , the stress relaxation associated with the rearrangements @xcite , the deformation profile @xcite , the averaged velocity @xcite .",
    "however , no mechanical measurement has been performed in those last studies .    in this paper",
    ", we study the mechanics of a foam flowing in relative displacement with respect to an obstacle , at a constant velocity . in a newtonian liquid at low reynolds number ,",
    "the force would vary linearly with the foam - obstacle relative velocity , the proportionality factor being linked to the liquid viscosity and the size of the obstacle .",
    "this experiment gives information on the effective viscosity of a flowing foam .",
    "such a stokes experiment has first been performed in a 3d coarsening foam by cox _",
    "_ @xcite . here",
    ", we measure the force exerted by the quasi 2d foam on the obstacle , as a function of the flow velocity , in a 2d geometry .",
    "a similar experiment has been performed recently to investigate the elastic regime of a 2d foam and measure the foam shear modulus @xcite . in the experiments presented here ,",
    "the foam flows permanently around the obstacle , and the stationary regime is investigated .",
    "the system used is a monolayer of soap bubbles confined between the surface of the solution and a horizontal plate .",
    "this allows measuring accurately the forces exerted on the obstacle ( section [ obstacleforce ] ) , and varying easily the foam internal parameters such as the viscosity of the solution , the bubble size , and the geometry of the obstacle .",
    "the article is organised as follows .",
    "the experimental materials and methods are presented in section ii , and the results are shown in section iii .",
    "these results are discussed in section iv , and conclusions are exposed in section v.",
    "the experimental setup is presented on fig .",
    "[ setup+flotteur](a ) .",
    "the experiments are performed in a glass channel of 110 cm length , 10 cm width and 10 cm depth .",
    "the soap solution is a solution of commercial dish - washing fluid ( 1% in volume ) in purified water , with added glycerol when the viscosity needs to be varied ( section [ sectionviscosity ] ) .",
    "the surface tension of the solution is @xmath0 mn m@xmath1 . at the beginning of each experiment ,",
    "the channel is filled with the solution , with a gap of thickness @xmath2 mm between the liquid surface and the coverslip .",
    "the foam is produced by blowing bubbles of nitrogen in the solution , at one end of the channel , in a chamber bounded by a barrier which allows a single monolayer of bubbles to form .",
    "the continuous gas flow makes the foam flow along the channel , between the surface of the solution and the coverslip , until it reaches the open end of the channel , where bubbles pop in contact with the atmosphere .",
    "leaks are carefully avoided , so that the total amount of liquid in the channel is constant during an experiment , and for each experiment .",
    "a typical image of the flowing foam observed from above is displayed in fig .",
    "[ image ] .",
    "( a ) experimental setup .",
    "the arrows indicate the flow of gas and foam .",
    "( b ) detailed sketch of the obstacle.,width=302 ]     photo of foam flowing from left to right around a circular obstacle of diameter 30 mm .",
    "the bubble size is 16.0 mm@xmath3 ( note the monodispersity of the foam ) , and the flow rate is 174 ml min@xmath1 .",
    "the walls of the channel ( width 10 cm ) are visible at the top and bottom of the picture .",
    "the stretching and shearing of bubbles due to the presence of the obstacle is clearly visible around the obstacle .",
    "the surface of the observed field is @xmath4 cm@xmath3 , and 1 pixel side equals 0.20 mm .",
    "films are available at ` http://www - lsp / link / mousses - films.htm ` at low ( 17 ml / min ) , moderate ( 112 ml / min ) and high ( 515 ml / min ) flow rates for this obstacle and bubble area.,width=302 ]      the obstacle stands in the middle of the channel .",
    "it is a buoyant mobile plastic cylinder connected to a fixed base by a soft glass fiber .",
    "the bottom extremity of the fiber is rigidly fixed .",
    "its top extremity simply passes through a hole drilled in the bottom of the cylinder ( fig [ setup+flotteur](b ) ) .",
    "therefore , the fiber can slide inside the horizontally moving cylinder , without applying any undesirable vertical force",
    ". moreover , the fiber is lubricated by the liquid , which avoids solid friction against the cylinder .",
    "the horizontal force @xmath6 exerted by the foam on the obstacle tends to pull it streamwise ; it is balanced by the horizontal drawback force @xmath7 from the elastic fiber , which deflection is designed by @xmath8 .",
    "the calculation of this force is classical in the theory of elasticity @xcite ; since the deflection of the fiber is too large to use linear hooke s law , we use the following one : @xmath9 , \\ ] ] where @xmath10 @xmath11 m is the fiber diameter , @xmath12 its vertical length and @xmath13 its shear modulus .",
    "this expansion gives a precision of 0.3% over the force .",
    "the derivation of formula ( [ force ] ) is detailed in the appendix .",
    "the fiber has been calibrated by measuring its deflection under its own weight , giving the value of the parameter : @xmath14 pa m@xmath15 .",
    "this value is compatible with typical values of the young modulus of glass : @xmath16@xmath17 pa . we use two different fibers of vertical lengths : @xmath18 mm and @xmath19 mm , depending on the magnitude of the force to measure .",
    "we have checked that for given experimental conditions , the same force measured with both fibers yields the same result ( data not shown ) .",
    "the displacement is measured by tracking the position of the obstacle with a ccd camera placed above the channel : the actual position of the obstacle is given by the coordinates of its center , obtained by image analysis .",
    "the position of the center of the obstacle is known with a precision of 0.02 mm , much lower than the typical displacement ( 5 mm to 1 cm ) . when the obstacle has reached a stationary position under flow ,",
    "the drawback force exactly compensates the force exerted by the foam , which is then directly deduced from the measured displacement .",
    "the obstacle is in contact with the coverslip .",
    "this is necessary for the foam to flow around the obstacle and not above it , but this may induce friction .",
    "nevertheless , in the setup presented here , the obstacle is in contact with a single plate ; this reduces the friction in comparison with an experiment performed in a hele - shaw cell , where the foam is confined between two plates .",
    "furthermore , the obstacle has an enclosed cavity closed by a watertight screw ( fig .",
    "[ setup+flotteur](b ) ) , which enables to tune its buoyancy such that the contact force with the top plate is minimal . in the presence of the foam ,",
    "the obstacle is in contact with the top plate through a capillary bridge , avoiding solid friction .",
    "we check for each experiment that the obstacle is not stuck : its position fluctuates under the slight flow heterogeneities , and results presented below average the position of the obstacle over 50 successive images with an interval of two seconds .",
    "viscous friction between the obstacle and the coverslip can not be eliminated , but it only influences transients , which are not considered in this paper : each measurement is performed in a stationary regime .",
    "reversibility and reproducibility tests give an upper bound for the force measurement errors : 0.2 mn , to be compared to the typical forces , of the order of 5 mn .",
    "as shown by fig .",
    "[ setup+flotteur](b ) , a part of the obstacle is immersed in the subphase , which may be drawn by the flowing foam .",
    "this flowing subphase exerts an additional force on the obstacle , which is negligible as shown by the following evaluation .",
    "the total height of the obstacle is 23 mm , so the immersed height is @xmath20 mm because the foam thickness remains close to the initial thickness of 3.5 mm between the solution and the coverslip .",
    "therefore , a generous upper bound of the drag exerted by the subphase would be obtained by assuming that the subphase flows at the same velocity @xmath21 that the foam .",
    "the diameter of the obstacle being @xmath22 mm and the width of the channel @xmath23 cm , the drag exerted by the flowing subphase of dynamic viscosity @xmath24 would equal @xcite : @xmath25 by taking the highest foam velocity reached in the experiments @xmath26 cm s@xmath1 and the highest dynamic viscosity used : @xmath27 pa s , the upper bound of the force would be then evaluated to @xmath28 mn , which is comparable to the other sources of error , and much lower than the typical forces exerted by the foam on the obstacle .",
    "a first control parameter is the nitrogen flow rate @xmath29 , which is adjusted using an electronic controller ( brooks instrument b.v . ) driven by a home - made software .",
    "the range of available flow rate runs on more than three decades , from 1 to 2,000 ml min@xmath1 , with a precision of 0.1 ml min@xmath1 .",
    "another control parameter is the bubble volume .",
    "it is indirectly determined by measuring the surface density of bubbles against the coverslip thanks to image analysis , using nih image software . since the mean foam thickness is fixed by the total amount of liquid in the channel , which is carefully kept constant",
    ", there is a unique relation between the bubble volume and the mean surface density . instead of this surface density",
    ", we will refer throughout this paper to its inverse , that we shall call the mean bubble area .",
    "this parameter slightly differs from the bubble area one can measure directly on an image , because it includes the water contained in the films and plateau borders surrounding bubbles . in our setup ,",
    "contrary to hele - shaw cells , the depth of the bubbles is free to adjust to pressure variations ; this entails an effective compressibility of the flow , and local variations of bubble area near the obstacle , as we shall see later ( section [ discussionarea ] ) .",
    "the surface density is measured at the left extremity of the observed field , where the influence of the obstacle is not significant ( fig .",
    "[ areafield ] ) .    for a given injector , the bubble volume increases with the gas flow rate . to control these two parameters separately , we blow the gas through one to six tubes ( or needles ) of same diameter simultaneously , keeping constant the flow rate per tube , hence the bubble volume . furthermore , the diameter of these injectors can be varied , which changes the flow rate per tube for the same bubble area ; hence , for a given bubble volume , typically ten different values of flow rate are available ( from 5 to 13 in the following data ) , with greatest flow rate at least 20 times greater than the lowest one . in this paper",
    ", we always produce monodisperse foams : the bubble area disorder , measured as the ratio of the standard deviation with the mean value of the bubble area distribution , is lower than 5% .",
    "six different bubble areas were used : 12.1 , 16.0 , 20.0 , 25.7 , 31.7 and 39.3 mm@xmath3 , chosen with a relative precision of 3% . the study of smaller bubbles would be problematic , since a transition from bubble monolayer to multilayer occurs at low bubble width / height ratio @xcite . at the other extremity ,",
    "we can not make a monodisperse foam with larger bubbles .",
    "another tunable parameter is the viscosity of the solution , that we will call bulk viscosity throughout the text .",
    "we control it by adding glycerol to the initial soap solution .",
    "we have used five different solutions , with 0 , 20 , 30 , 40 and 50% glycerol in mass .",
    "the respective kinematic viscosities @xmath30 , measured with a capillary viscometer ( schott - gerte ) at room temperature , are equal to 1.06 , 1.6 , 2.3 , 3.8 and 9.3 mm@xmath3 s@xmath1 .",

    "to our knowledge , our work is the first to provide systematic measurements of the drag exerted by a flowing foam in a channel around an obstacle .",
    "this is to compare to the simulations of mitsoulis and coworkers @xcite , who computed the drag exerted by a flowing bingham plastic past a cylinder similar in geometry to our circle , for different values of obstacle diameters .",
    "a bingham plastic is characterized by its yield stress @xmath55 and its plastic viscosity @xmath11 , and it follows the constitutive equation : @xmath56 for @xmath57 , and @xmath58 for @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the shear stress and @xmath61 the applied strain .",
    "to summarize , mitsoulis and coworkers show that the drag exerted by a flowing bingham plastic around a cylinder strongly depends on the bingham number @xmath62 comparing elastic and viscous contribution : at a given bingham number of order unity , there is a crossover between a newtonian - like behaviour of the drag ( for @xmath63 ) given by formula ( [ faxen ] ) , and an elastic - like ( for @xmath64 ) where drag does not significantly depend on the velocity and is roughly proportional to the cylinder diameter .",
    "though the validity of modeling foam as a bingham plastic is an open debate , this work provides an interesting comparison to our experimental measurements , for which we now evaluate the order of magnitude of the bingham number .",
    "the yield stress for a foam is of order @xcite @xmath65 , with @xmath66 mn m@xmath1 the surface tension and @xmath67 mm the typical length of a bubble edge ( we recall that the bubble area is 16.0 mm@xmath3 in the considered experiments , and compute @xmath68 for a hexagonal bubble ) , so @xmath69 pa ( to be rigorous , this overestimates the yield stress for a wet foam ) .",

    "[ area](b ) ) a rough value of the plastic viscosity of the foam : dimensional analysis yields @xmath71 where @xmath45 is the cross - section of the foam , so bingham number writes @xmath72 .",
    "the typical value of flow rate in our experiments is @xmath73 ml min@xmath1 , hence the typical bingham number equals @xmath74 .",
    "though this is a very rough evaluation , it tends to show that in our range of flow rates , the bingham number remains of order unity , hence both elastic and fluid properties of the foam are involved in the interaction with the obstacle to create the drag .",

    "[ drag(q , obstacle ) ] for which elastic and plastic contribution are of same order of magnitude .",
    "our measurements of drag _ versus _",
    "viscosity @xmath30 and flow rate @xmath29 yield the following scaling : @xmath75 ( see section [ sectionviscosity ] ) . to our knowledge , this is the first time that such a scaling is proposed to quantify the dynamical regime of flowing foams .",
    "up to now , the dynamic regime of flowing foam has been mainly investigated through the study of pressure drop of foam confined in capillaries ( see ref . and references therein ) , to model the behaviour of foams in porous media @xcite . since the seminal work of bretherton @xcite , who studied the friction between an infinitely long bubble and a solid wall , all these studies emphasize the role of the capillary number @xmath76 , where @xmath24 is the dynamic bulk viscosity , @xmath77 its surface tension and @xmath21 the velocity of the flowing foam . in the frame of our study ,",
    "the capillary number is proportional to the product @xmath78 .",
    "it appears from our scaling ( [ f(q , nu ) ] ) that such a number is not sufficient to describe the dynamic regime of a flowing foam , because the exponents for viscosity and flow rate differ significantly , and pressure drop measurements confirm this observation @xcite .",
    "since the velocity - dependent part of the drag is related to friction of slipping bubbles along the obstacle , bretherton s theory is therefore not sufficient to explain our measurements : additional physical ingredients are involved , like detailed bubble shape and interfacial rheology ( surface elasticity and viscosity ) .",
    "this has not been investigated yet .",
    "discrepancies from bretherton s theory have already been widely pointed out and studied for bubbles and foams in capillaries ( see ref . for a review ) , but they still considered the capillary number as the essential dimensionless parameter .",
    "let us notice that the scaling ( [ f(q , nu ) ] ) is a consequence of the chosen fit ( [ linear fit ] ) .",
    "we are aware that some rheological studies @xcite show that storage and loss moduli of foams happen to depend on the applied shear .",
    "this would lead to a behaviour like @xmath79 , the exponent @xmath80 accounting either for shear - thinning ( @xmath81 ) or shear - thickening ( @xmath82 ) . if such effects exist in our system , they are small enough to yield results consistent with @xmath83 within our experimental accuracy",

    "the yield drag has two contributions : an elastic one arising from the elastic stresses in the network of bubbles , and another one arising from the anisotropic pressure distribution in the bubbles surrounding the obstacle , as already shown in preliminary simulations of our experiments @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in section [ controlparameters ] , the depth of the bubbles adjust to pressure variations . at constant bubble volume",
    ", there is therefore a relation between bubble area and pressure , that we can use to evaluate the order of magnitude of the pressure contribution to the yield drag . to establish this relation",
    ", we assume that each bubble has the same volume @xmath84 , which is reasonable in our experiments . as a crude model ,",
    "we treat bubbles as cylinders of height @xmath85 and of horizontal area @xmath86 ; hence , @xmath87 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 mm refer to mean values .",
    "we then assume that the pressure @xmath90 inside the bubbles equilibrates with the pressure in the bulk solution in contact . at vanishing flow rate",
    ", this pressure is hydrostatic , hence we write @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is a constant reference pressure , and @xmath93 kg / m@xmath94 is the volumetric mass of the solution .",
    "the pressure resultant on the obstacle then writes : @xmath95 , the integral being taken on the contact surface between the obstacle and the bubbles . since @xmath92 is constant , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the length element on the boundary of the obstacle and @xmath99 the normal vector . since @xmath100 one obtains : @xmath101 this formula links the pressure contribution to yield drag to the bubble area field .     bubble area field around the circle of diameter 30 mm .",
    "the observed zone is the same as fig .",
    "[ image ] .",
    "the solution viscosity is 1.06 mm@xmath3 s@xmath1 , and the mean bubble area is @xmath102 mm@xmath3 .",
    "the flow rate , 24 ml min@xmath1 , was chosen such that the velocity - dependent contribution to the drag is negligible ( see fig .",
    "[ drag ( area ) ] ) .",
    "black zones represent the obstacle and the channel walls , and white zones the regions where the bubble area is not measurable precisely .",
    "the darker the color , the lower the bubble area hence the higher the pressure .",
    "the area variation is significant , with a maximum relative variation of 18% .",
    "the pressure is maximal at the leading side of the circle and minimal at its trailing side ( maximal variation : 70 pa).,width=302 ]    we illustrate this measurement of pressure on one example ( fig .",
    "[ areafield ] ) .",
    "the bubble area field clearly shows the influence of the obstacle : bubbles are compressed upstream and relax downstream , which qualitatively shows that the pressure resultant acts in the same sense as elastic stress . computing formula ( [ pressure ] ) over the dashed contour in fig .",
    "[ areafield ] , which is the closest contour to the obstacle where bubble area is properly evaluable , yields an order of magnitude of 0.7 mn for @xmath103 , which is about 30% of the yield drag ( 2.5 mn for the studied example , see fig .",
    "[ area](a ) ) .",
    "the calculation of pressure for various bubble areas , as well as for higher flow rates and other obstacles , is still in progress , but the variation depicted in fig .",
    "[ areafield ] does not vary qualitatively , and pressure contribution to yield drag is not negligible .",
    "another difficulty arises from the variation of fluid fraction with bubble area . in our setup",
    ", the monolayer of bubbles is in contact with a reservoir of water , and the amount of water in the plateau borders and films between bubbles is freely chosen by the system .",
    "therefore , the mean fluid fraction should vary with bubble area ; detailed measurements of this quantity are in progress ( first rough estimate : about 9% ) .",
    "furthermore , local effects such as dilatancy @xcite could increase the fluid fraction near the obstacle , because of the shear experienced by the foam in this zone .",
    "this complicates the interpretation of the evolution of yield drag with bubble area , since many studies have shown that rheological properties of foams and emulsions depend on fluid fraction @xcite .",
    "however , we can check that the order of magnitude of our measured yield drag agrees qualitatively with the known value of the yield stress , of order @xcite @xmath65 .",
    "hence , the order of magnitude of the elastic contribution to the yield drag is @xmath104 .",
    "for an hexagonal bubble , @xmath105 , hence @xmath106 , and numerically : @xmath107 , with mn and mm@xmath3 as units for the force and for the area .",
    "this elastic drag is plotted in fig . [",
    "area ] ; though it is a very rough evaluation , we check that it is of the same order of magnitude as the yield drag , but that it is not high enough to fit the experimental results : this is again a signature of the significance of the pressure contribution .",
    "we now propose a qualitative argument to explain why the viscous coefficient decreases with the bubble area , based on the dissipation model of cantat and coworkers @xcite .",
    "these authors state that dissipation in flowing foam is localised in the plateau borders between bubbles and walls . hence",
    ", the viscous coefficient should increase with the number of bubbles surrounding the obstacle , and therefore should decrease with the bubble area , which is actually seen in fig .",
    "[ area](b ) .",
    "note that this model does not capture the increase observed for the bubble area of 39.3 mm@xmath3 , but as seen in fig .",
    "[ drag ( area ) ] , the drag does not depend affinely on the flow rate for this area , hence our linear fit is not relevant . as an additional remark ,",
    "friction in the foam should strongly depend on the boundary conditions at the interfaces between films and bubbles , hence the viscous coefficient probably changes with the surface rheology .",
    "it would thus be interesting to investigate the influence of the surfactant used on the drag measurements .",
    "we have shown ( fig .",
    "[ drag_on_square(orient ) ] ) that the drag exerted on the square obstacle does not significantly depend on its orientation .",
    "the same result holds in low reynolds hydrodynamics , merely owing to the linearity of the stokes equation and to the high symmetry of the square @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the drag does depend on the orientation at high reynolds number @xcite .",
    "we thus think this result provides a good test to validate possible constitutive equations for foams ; it tends to prove the relevance of linear models , at least in the studied range of control parameters .",
    "we have chosen to compare the various obstacles through an effective drag and a ratio between the viscous coefficient and the yield drag .",
    "we think this is relevant since this way of comparison involves both the elastic and the viscous contribution to the drag , which have comparable weight in the studied range of flow rate ( fig .",
    "[ drag(q , obstacle ) ] ) .",
    "furthermore , this provides a way to compare obstacles of different shapes .",
    "[ drag_coefficient(obstacle ) ] shows that the dimensional drag coefficient does not vary much with the obstacle , except for the airfoil .",
    "though the cross length is not the unique characteristic length of the obstacles , this shows that the drag is roughly proportional to the size of the obstacle .",
    "this is not an obvious result : considering the flow of a newtonian fluid around a cylinder in the same geometry as ours , and defining like before a drag coefficient as the ratio between the drag ( [ faxen ] ) and the radius of the cylinder , it can be shown that this drag coefficient would increase significantly with the radius . the complete formula ( [ faxen ] ) , not shown for the sake of simplicity ( see ref . ) , yields a drag coefficient 2.6 times higher for a cylinder of diameter 48 mm than for the one of diameter 30 mm , whereas the values of table [ valuesobstacles ] show that the drag coefficients for these two cylinders are comparable in our experiments .",
    "this proves again the significance of elastic effects in our case , and agrees qualitatively with the results of mitsoulis @xcite who showed that for a bingham plastic , the effect of channel walls remains weak , even when the diameter of the cylinder equals the half of the channel width , as far as elastic effects are dominant .",
    "the ratio between viscous coefficient and yield drag , whose values are tabulated in table [ valuesobstacles ] , does not change significantly between the cylinders , the cogwheel and the square , whereas it increases much for the airfoil .",
    "this is clearly a signature of shape : one intuitively expects elastic effects to act on the cross section orthogonal to the flow to pull the obstacle streamwise , whereas the viscous contribution to the drag arises from the friction in the lubrication films between the obstacle and the bubbles slipping along it .",
    "hence , one expects the viscous contribution to increase with the cross section parallel to the flow .",
    "this explains why the viscous coefficient / yield drag ratio is higher for the airfoil , owing to the great difference between the two considered sections for this profile .",
    "furthermore , the decrease of the drag coefficient for the airfoil , as well as the variation of this coefficient with the orientation of the square , shows that the shape of the obstacles influences the results through streamlining : for a given size , drag is reduced on an obstacle whose shape is well adapted to the flow , like in aerodynamics .",
    "the values displayed in table [ valuesobstacles ] show that the boundary conditions do not affect much the drag : the dimensional drag coefficient is close to those for the two cylinders , whereas the ratio between viscous coefficient and yield drag is slightly lower . actually , the cogwheel and the trapped bubbles form a closed system during the experiment : no rearrangement of the trapped bubbles occurs after all the cogs have been filled with bubbles .",
    "so this system behaves as an effective obstacle , but with an external boundary constituted of bubble edges , instead of a solid boundary .",
    "this could explain the slight decrease of the viscous coefficient / yield drag ratio : at low velocity , the foam feels the presence of the effective obstacle , but at high velocity , the friction between this effective obstacle and the surrounding flowing bubbles is lower than the friction between a solid obstacle and its neighbouring flowing bubbles . to be more quantitative , it would be interesting to study the influence of interfacial rheology on this friction . anyway , the measurements show that the influence of boundary conditions is not dramatic , probably because it does not change much the features of the flow beyond the first layer of bubbles .",
    "this work provides the first detailed and systematic measurements of the force exerted by a 2d flowing foam on an obstacle as a function of various control parameters : flow rate , bulk viscosity , bubble volume and obstacle orientation , size , shape and boundary conditions .",
    "all the data show two contributions to the drag : a yield drag at vanishing flow rate , and a flow rate - dependent contribution .",
    "we have shown that the yield drag is independent of the bulk viscosity , decreases with bubble volume and linearly increases with the obstacle size . moreover ,",
    "both elastic stresses and pressure contribute significantly to the yield drag .",
    "fitting the flow rate - dependant contribution by a linear law , we have shown that the slope ( or viscous coefficient ) increases with the bulk viscosity as a power law with an exponent around @xmath108 ; moreover , the viscous coefficient globally decreases with the bubble volume and linearly increases with the obstacle size .",
    "furthermore , we have studied the influence of the obstacle shape and showed the existence of streamlining effects in foams , and we pointed out that the effect of boundary conditions on the obstacle is not striking .",
    "this work opens many perspectives .",
    "other control parameters remain to be studied , like bubble area polydispersity and rheological properties of the surfactants .",
    "the effects of those parameters on the drag could help to study their influence on foam rheology .",
    "pressure drop measurements , allowing to study dissipation in foams @xcite , are in progress @xcite .",
    "now , a local analysis of the stresses , deformations @xcite and velocity fields is required to provide a more detailed comprehension of the foam rheology .",
    "such a study is also in progress .",
    "the comparison between this local analysis and the global properties of the foam , such as our drag measurements , could provide a way to propose and test constitutive equations for the mechanics of foams .",
    "the authors would like to thank franck bernard , kamal gam , julien deffayet and arnaud huillier for experimental help , the machine shop of laboratoire de spectromtrie physique and patrice ballet for technical support , and simon cox , wiebke drenckhan , isabelle cantat and renaud delannay for enlightening discussions .",
    "we consider a fiber of vertical length @xmath12 that experiences a horizontal force @xmath6 ( fig . [ calcul_force ] ) .",
    "all lengths are adimensionalised by @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the inertia moment ( @xmath111 being the fiber diameter ) and @xmath13 the young modulus .",
    "the position along the fiber is expressed as a function of the angle @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , the position of the extremity of the fiber writes in the general case @xcite : @xmath112 this yields an implicit expression between the force and the deflection involving elliptic functions , which is not easy to evaluate .      the fiber can experience large deflections ( up to 12 mm for a length of 34.8 mm )",
    ", so we need a more accurate expression than the linearized one : @xmath113 . to do that",
    ", we develop the previous expression in power series of @xmath12 , that yields : @xmath114 .",
