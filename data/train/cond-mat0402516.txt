    "in the last decades the physics of josephson junctions ( jj ) has revealed an extraordinary wealth of phenomena studied theoretically and experimentally as well @xcite . the underlying system , two superconducting domains separated by a tunnel barrier , can be found in a variety of realizations , recently e.g.  in superconducting atomic contacts @xcite and solid - state quantum bits @xcite .",
    "basically two parameters determine the dynamics , namely , the josephson coupling energy @xmath0 and the charging energy @xmath1 of a junction with capacitance @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that the competition between these two scales is crucially influenced by the electromagnetic environment surrounding the junction , i.e.  its impedance which in the simplest case is given by an ohmic resistor with resistance @xmath3 .    for the classical jj dynamics charging effects are negligible and the charge transfer corresponds to a phase - coherent cooper pair current @xmath4 with @xmath5 , the phase difference across the junction @xmath6 , and where the phase velocity ( @xmath7 ) is related to the voltage drop @xmath8 across the junction . in the opposite limit of dominating @xmath9 ,",
    "however , charging effects prevail and coulomb blockade is known to rule the transfer of incoherent tunneling of cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "a particular appealing feature of a jj is the fact that its classical dynamics can be visualized as the diffusive motion of a fictitious classical particle ( rsj model ) @xcite .",
    "accordingly , for a current biased jj the case of very small capacitance corresponds to very strong friction ( smoluchowski limit ) associated with the phase dynamics @xmath10 here the translation rules are : mass @xmath11 , damping strength @xmath12 , potential @xmath13 with the energy @xmath14 related to the bias current , and current noise @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the corresponding time evolution equation for the phase distribution ( smoluchowski equation ) has been studied in detail already in the 60s @xcite . even in the overdamped",
    "limit the charging energy @xmath9 can be relatively large and the crucial question arises in which way charging effects alter the diffusive phase dynamics of jjs . while this has been analyzed at very low temperatures @xcite and for small @xcite and large @xcite josephson couplings , much less",
    "is known for intermediate temperatures and coupling energies .",
    "the goal of this paper is to fill this gap for overdamped junctions by providing a generalization of the classical ivanchenko - zilberman theory ( izt ) @xcite .",
    "as we will show , the classical and quantum regimes are characterized by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , with @xmath20 meaning that in a mechanical analog where @xmath21 the appearance of charging effects is associated with the changeover from classical ( @xmath22 ) to quantum ( @xmath23 ) overdamped phase diffusion . while",
    "in general the dissipative dynamics of a quantum particle is a formidable task @xcite , it was shown recently @xcite that in the overdamped limit considered here the reduced quantum dynamics can be described by a general extension of the classical smoluchowski equation , the so - called quantum smoluchowski equation ( qse ) .",
    "this allows to reveal the relation between classical and coulomb blocked transport in overdamped jjs in terms of a simple analytical approach .",
    "classical overdamped motion is based upon a separation of time scales between relaxation of position and relaxation of momentum @xcite .",
    "momentum is slaved to position and on a coarse grained time scale can assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with respect to the instantaneous position of the particle .",
    "quantum dissipative dynamics is much more complicated and usually has to be formulated in terms of the path integral formalism @xcite .",
    "this approach has been exploited very successfully in the past to describe low temperature properties of jjs in particular @xcite and of dissipative particles in periodic potentials in general @xcite .",
    "explicit calculations require involved techniques though , and analytic expressions are available only in certain ranges of parameter space .",
    "the problem is that quantum fluctuations acting on time scales of order @xmath24 lead , particularly at low temperatures , to long range interactions in time @xcite .",
    "recently it was shown , however , that in the overdamped domain the exact quantum time evolution can be mapped onto a quantum generalization of the classical smoluchowski equation for the position probability distribution .",

    "it is important to note that for realistic jj with finite @xmath35 the classical description @xcite is always restricted to small and moderate values of @xmath65 , while with increasing @xmath65 one approaches the quantum smoluchowski range with a finite @xmath29 [ see ( [ qsen3b ] ) and fig .

    "note that the diffusion constant used here differs from the original one given in @xcite in that it ensures vanishing stationary currents in thermal equilibrium to all orders in @xmath29 .",
