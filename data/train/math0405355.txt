    "in this paper we suggest a new way to use talagrand s concentration inequality on the cube to control the deviations of boolean functions that satisfy certain monotonicity conditions . as one application",
    "we prove a suboptimal deviation inequality for the count of @xmath4-cycles in a random graph .",
    "let @xmath5 and define a probability measure @xmath6 on @xmath7 by @xmath8 consider a product space @xmath9 with a product probability measure @xmath10 given a function @xmath11 and a point @xmath12 we define @xmath13 and @xmath14 note that @xmath15 if @xmath16    let us state the main result of this paper .",
    "if @xmath1 and @xmath17 are non - decreasing in each coordinate then for any @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath20    to understand the statement of theorem 1 , we notice that a function @xmath21 can be interpreted as a kind of discrete lipschitz norm of @xmath2 locally at the point @xmath3 for example , since @xmath1 is defined only on the vertices of @xmath22-dimensional cube , if one extends @xmath1 linearly from the point @xmath23 to its neighbours only along the coordinates where @xmath24 then @xmath21 is the norm of that linear map . indeed ,",
    "if we denote the map by @xmath25 then @xmath26 and @xmath27    the proof of theorem1 is based on talagrand s concentration inequality on @xmath28 in order to give more clear interpretation of ( [ selfnorm ] ) , let us compare it with some typical ways of using talagrand s inequality .",
    "one common application is the following . given a convex function @xmath29^m\\to{\\mathbb{r}}$ ] with a lipschitz norm @xmath30^m } \\frac{|f(x)-f(y)|}{|x - y| } < \\infty,\\ ] ] where the supremum is taken over @xmath31 the following inequality holds : @xmath32 if the function @xmath33 is defined only on the vertices of the cube @xmath34 then it is possible to state a similar result where one has to use a discrete analog of the lipschitz norm . for example , the following deviation inequality holds ( see @xcite ) . for @xmath35 we define @xmath36 such that @xmath37 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 and define @xmath40 then @xmath41 both inequalities ( [ convin ] ) and ( [ bob ] ) use global lipschitz condition to control the deviation of @xmath42 theorem 1 suggests a possibility of using a local lipschitz norm @xmath43 at the point @xmath44 provided that the monotonicity conditions are satisfied .",
    "the reason why we compute the lipschitz norm only in the direction of decreasing @xmath2 is because we control the deviation of @xmath2 _ above _ level @xmath45 theorem 1 is similar in spirit to the ideas in @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ( see also references therein ) , where the authors describe a way of using average lipschitz norm of @xmath2 to control its deviations .",
    "one example when the monotonicity conditions are satisfied is the following .",
    "let us consider a set of indices @xmath46 and a set of nonnegative numbers @xmath47 indexed by the subsets @xmath48 consider the function @xmath1 defined by @xmath49 in this case the fact that @xmath50 s are non - negative implies that functions @xmath1 and @xmath17 are non - decreasing in each coordinate .",
    "below we will consider the example of counting the number of @xmath4-cycles in a random graph which can be represented in the form ( [ pos ] ) and , thus , theorem 1 is applicable .    consider a standard erds - rnyi model of a random graph @xmath51 let @xmath52 be a set of @xmath53 vertices , @xmath54 and let @xmath55 denote a set of edges of a complete graph @xmath56 on @xmath53 vertices .",
    "given @xmath57 the fact that @xmath58 or @xmath59 describes that the edge @xmath60 is present or not present in the graph @xmath61 respectively .",
    "let @xmath62 be a collection of all @xmath4-cycles , and for @xmath63 let @xmath64 be a set of all @xmath4-cycles containing the edge @xmath65 we consider the following function on @xmath9 @xmath66 which is the number of @xmath4-cycles in a random graph @xmath61 . in this case",
    "@xmath67 can be clearly written as @xmath68 in this case , in order to use theorem 1 to control the deviation of @xmath1 above its median @xmath69 ( or its expectation @xmath70 ) we will proceed by showing how to control @xmath67 in terms of @xmath71    we assume that for some large enough @xmath72 @xmath73 the following theorem holds .",
    "if ( [ pee ] ) holds then there exists a constant @xmath74 that depends on @xmath4 only such that @xmath75    theorems 1 and 2 will readily imply the following theorem .",
    "if ( [ pee ] ) holds then ,    \\(1 ) for any @xmath76 there exists a constant @xmath77 that depends on @xmath4 and @xmath78 only such that the following holds @xmath79    \\(2 ) there exists a constant @xmath74 such that if @xmath80 then @xmath81    recently the authors of @xcite proved a more general result describing the deviations of the count of any subgraph in a random graph . in the case of @xmath4-cycles",
    "their bound gives @xmath82 this shows that the factor @xmath83 in ( [ dev ] ) is unnecessary , but at the moment we do nt see how to get rid of it using our approach .",
    "this has nothing to do with theorem 1 , since the factor @xmath83 comes directly from theorem 2 which , probably , can be improved . in the case of triangles ( @xmath84 ) the bound @xmath85 was also proved in @xcite .",
    "talagrand s concentration inequality on the discrete cube is the main tool in the proof of theorem 1 .",
    "let us recall it first",
    ".    given a point @xmath86 and a set @xmath87 let us denote @xmath88 the `` convex hull '' distance between the point @xmath23 and the set @xmath89 is defined as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the euclidean norm of @xmath92 the concentration inequality of talagrand ( theorem 4.3.1 in @xcite ) states the following .",
    "for any @xmath19 @xmath93    the main feature of this distance is that ( theorem 4.1.2 in @xcite ) @xmath94 * proof of theorem 1 .",
    "* for a fixed number @xmath18 consider a set @xmath95 for a fixed @xmath96 and an arbitrary @xmath97 since @xmath98 we can write @xmath99 consider three sets of indices @xmath100 without loss of generality we will assume that @xmath101 and @xmath102 define a sequence @xmath103 we have @xmath104 since @xmath105 ( i.e. @xmath106 ) implies that @xmath107 we have @xmath108 since for this range of indices @xmath109 @xmath110 since the function @xmath2 is non - decreasing in each coordinate and for @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 and all other coordinates of @xmath114 and @xmath115 coincide , and @xmath116 since for @xmath117 each coordinate of @xmath114 is smaller than the corresponding coordinate of @xmath3 thus we proved that for any @xmath118 @xmath119 by ( [ t2 ] ) there exists @xmath118 such that the last expression can be bounded @xmath120 talagrand s inequality ( [ t1 ] ) states that @xmath121 and , therefore , we finally get @xmath122",
    "we will denote by @xmath123 the degree of a vertex @xmath124 consider the sequence of sets @xmath125 we will start by stating several basic facts that will be used in the proof of theorem 2 .    if ( [ pee ] ) holds then , @xmath126    * proof .",
    "* for a fixed vertex @xmath127 its degree @xmath123 is a sum of @xmath128 independent variables with the distribution @xmath129 using bernstein s inequality one can easily check that for @xmath130 @xmath131 the union bound will produce a factor @xmath53 and , therefore , using ( [ pee ] ) implies ( [ basic1 ] ) .",
    "thus , with high probability we can assume that the degree of each vertex is bounded by @xmath132 and , therefore , we can only consider the sets @xmath133 in ( [ sets ] ) such that @xmath134 and , therefore , @xmath135    next we will bound the cardinality of each @xmath136    for @xmath74 large enough we have , @xmath137    * proof . * we copy the proof from @xcite ( see equation ( 12 ) in section 4.2 there ) .",
    "for a fixed @xmath138 assume that @xmath139 in this case , there exists a set of @xmath140 vertices each with degree at least @xmath141 it implies that the number of edges containing exactly one of these vertices exceeds @xmath142 the probability that such a set of edges exists is bounded by @xmath143 where in the last inequality we used the estimate @xmath144 and the first term @xmath145 was negligible compared to the second term . taking the union bound over @xmath146 we get a factor @xmath147 in front of the exponent that can be ignored by increasing @xmath148    before we will state our next lemma , we need to make one remark about the proof of theorem 2 . multiplying out the right - hand side of ( [ vee ] )",
    "we observe that @xmath67 can be written as a sum of terms @xmath149 each of these terms may appear several times , but , clearly , the number of appearances will be bounded by @xmath150 that depends on @xmath4 only .",
    "each of these term represents two cycles that have at least one edge in common .",
    "there are many different isometric configurations of such two cycles but , clearly , the number of them is bounded by a constant that depends on @xmath4 only .",
    "hence , @xmath67 can be decomposed into the sum of the counts of such pairs of cycles over different configuration . with minor modifications",
    "it is possible to prove the statement of the theorem for each of these configuration .",
    "we will only look at the pairs of cycles that have exactly one edge in common .",
    "let us denote the number of such pair by @xmath151 we will identify each pair of cycles with an injection @xmath152 such that @xmath153 and @xmath154 are the ordered vertices of these two cycles , and @xmath155 is their only common edge . let us denote the set of these injections by @xmath156    there is a partition of vertices @xmath157 such that @xmath158    * proof .",
    "* see proposition 1.3 in @xcite .",
    "let us denote the set in the statement of lemma 3 by @xmath159 * proof of theorem 2 .",
    "* by lemma 3 and the discussion preceeding lemma 3 , all we need to do is to estimate the cardinality of @xmath160 in ( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "let us consider the event @xmath161 by lemma 1 and lemma 2 this event holds with probability at least @xmath162 for some @xmath150 large enough . from now on",
    "we assume that this event occurs . for each vertex @xmath163",
    "let us denote @xmath164 let us denote @xmath165 we will prove that if @xmath166 occurs than for @xmath167 @xmath168 for @xmath169 this obviously holds with @xmath170 we proceed by induction over @xmath171 let us decompose @xmath172 where @xmath173    to bound the cardinality of @xmath174 we use the induction hypothesis and the fact that the degree of each vertex in the set @xmath175 is bounded by @xmath176 we get @xmath177 to bound the cardinality of @xmath178 for @xmath179 we notice that for each @xmath180 we have @xmath181 and @xmath182 on the event",
    "@xmath183 we can control the cardinality of @xmath133 and , moreover , the degree @xmath184 for @xmath185 since @xmath186 we get @xmath187 and since on the event @xmath166 we can assume that @xmath188 which implies that @xmath146 we get @xmath189 and this proves the induction step for @xmath190 the last inequality explains the appearance of the factor @xmath83 in theorem 3 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath191 we get @xmath192 and @xmath193 this completes the proof of the induction step and ( [ path ] ) .    to estimate the cardinality of @xmath160 we will decompose it into @xmath194 where @xmath195 we will estimate the cardinality of @xmath196 and @xmath197 differently ( the idea is illustrated in figure 1 ) .",
    "first of all , since we can control the cardinality of @xmath133 for @xmath138 we will simply use ( [ path ] ) for @xmath198 to compute the number of different paths from @xmath163 to @xmath199 and then add them up . this will give us the bound on cardinality of @xmath200 on the other hand , for @xmath201 we can represent it as a cycle on @xmath202 and a path from @xmath203 to @xmath204 in this case , the number of cycles is bounded by @xmath205 and to bound the number of paths we again use ( [ path ] ) .",
    "let first estimate the cardinality of @xmath200 first of all by ( [ path ] ) for each vertex @xmath206 @xmath207 and , therefore , on the event @xmath208 @xmath209 when we add up these injections over @xmath179 we get @xmath210 this accounts for the second term in the bound of the theorem .",
    "now consider all injections @xmath211 such that @xmath212 .",
    "consider the trace of the set of images of the injections from @xmath160 ( in other words , pairs of cycles ) on the set @xmath213 i.e. @xmath214 first of all , the cardinality of @xmath215 is bounded by @xmath205 since @xmath215 can be identified with the subset of all cycles in the random graph . moreover , for each @xmath216 the number of injections @xmath217 such that @xmath218 is bounded by @xmath219 since all values of the injection are fixed except for @xmath220 but since @xmath221 implies that the degree @xmath222 and , thus , @xmath223 we have by ( [ path ] ) @xmath224 therefore , the cardinality of all injections such that @xmath212 is bounded by @xmath225 which accounts for the first term in the statement of the theorem .",
    "theorem 2 implies that for any @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath226 which implies that @xmath227 multiplying both sides by @xmath228 and using theorem 1 with @xmath229 we get @xmath230 if we take @xmath231 then , clearly , the following two events are equal @xmath232 and , therefore , ( [ final ] ) implies that for @xmath233 for large enough @xmath72 @xmath234 since @xmath235 the choice of @xmath236 as in ( [ a ] ) gives @xmath237 this , clearly , implies the first statement of theorem 3 .    to prove the second statement we use ( [ final ] ) with @xmath238 and assume that @xmath239 is large enough , so that @xmath240 then with probability at least @xmath241 we have @xmath242 since @xmath243 for small enough @xmath78 this implies that @xmath244 which completes the proof of the second statement of theorem 3"
