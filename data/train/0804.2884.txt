    "the supernova remnant ( snr ) paradigm for the origin of galactic cosmic rays is based on the assumption that at least @xmath1 of the kinetic energy of the expanding shell is converted into cosmic rays ( crs ) . moreover , as recent observations have proved , the magnetic field ( mf ) in the shock vicinity is amplified by a large amount ( e.g. @xcite ) as would be expected if cosmic rays induce streaming instability ( si ) upstream of the shock .",
    "we stress that such mf amplification is required to accelerate protons up to @xmath2 gev .",
    "the need for a satisfactory and self - consistent description of these points is sufficient to justify the development of a nlt of particle acceleration .",
    "the developments of the theory are summarized in ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . the kinetic theory for arbitrary diffusion coefficients ( @xcite ) , and even in the case of self - generated mfs ( @xcite and @xcite ) has been recently developed .    all approaches to nl shock acceleration find that the large pressure of the accelerated particles decelerates the incoming gas , and leads to total compression factors that scale with the mach number of the shock as @xmath3 .",
    "such large shock modifications however are at odds with observations which are better fit by @xmath4 .",
    "the problem with larger values of @xmath5 resides in both the estimated distance between the forward and reverse shocks ( @xcite ) and in the fit to multifreqeuncy observations with concave spectra ( vbk05 and references therein ) .",
    "the reduction in the compression factor is almost invariably attributed to turbulent heating ( th ) in the precursor ( @xcite and later ) as due to damping of waves on the background plasma ( @xcite , hereafter mkv82 ) .",
    "in fact this mechanism was originally proposed in order to keep the mf amplification in the linear regime ( e.g. @xmath6 ) , but is now commonly applied to cases in which @xmath7 . unfortunately , the heating process is quite model dependent and even its applicability to situations of interest for snrs can and should be seriously questioned .",
    "the effectiveness of the heating process can easily be reduced to negligible levels or artificially amplified to unphysical levels .    as mentioned above ,",
    "a breakthrough in the field has recently been provided by x - ray observations : the detection of x - ray bright filaments in the outskirts of some snrs allows one to infer the strength of the mf in these filaments , found to be @xmath8 .",
    "such strong fields are generally attributed to the si induced by crs efficiently accelerated at the shock front , although alternative explanations have been proposed ( @xcite ) . in tab .",
    "[ tab ] we list some snrs with estimated mfs : @xmath9 is the shock velocity , @xmath10 is the mf downstream of the shock as inferred from the x - ray brightness profile and @xmath11 is the downstream magnetic pressure normalized to the bulk one .",
    "the values of the parameters are from @xcite and from vbk05 ( in parenthesis in tab . [ tab ] ) .",

    "it is crucial to keep in mind that , contrary to the th , which can be either suppressed or amplified by changing parameters on which there is little or no control , the feedback of the self - generated turbulent mf on the plasma is not model dependent and must be included .",
    "the reaction of accelerated particles upstream of the shock leads to the formation of a precursor , in which the fluid speed decreases while approaching the shock .",
    "one can describe this effect by introducing two compression factors @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the fluid speed and the indexes @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 refer to quantities at upstream infinity , upstream and downstream of the subshock respectively .",
    "the most general equations of conservation of mass , momentum and energy in the stationary case for a parallel shock are : @xmath21 @xmath22    as usual , @xmath23 , @xmath17 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 stand for density , velocity , pressure and the ratio of specific heats of the gas , while @xmath26 and @xmath27 represent the pressure and energy flux in the form of alfvn waves .",
    "@xmath28 is the cr pressure .",
    "the continuity of the distribution function of the accelerated particles through the subshock implies that the cr pressure is also continuous ( @xmath29 ) , and that the term @xmath30 gives null contribution when eq .",
    "[ eq : energy ] is integrated from @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "all previous equations at the subshock read as the usual rankine - hugoniot relations at a magnetized gaseous shock .    in order to treat the presence of alfvn waves correctly ,",
    "we use the approach of @xcite ( hereafter vs99 ) , considering two upstream wave trains with helicities @xmath33 , and their respective downstream counterparts .",
    "if @xmath34 is a mode of the mf perturbation , we write the velocity perturbation as @xmath35 . neglecting the electric field contribution , which is of order @xmath36 , the magnetic pressure and the energy flux , which for alfvn waves is the sum of the normal component of poynting vector @xmath37 and the transverse kinetic energy flux @xmath38 , are @xmath39 having posed @xmath40 .",
    "the upstream magnetic turbulence typically shows two opposite helicities ( @xcite ) , each of which splits into a reflected and a transmitted wave crossing the subshock . according to vs99 , the transmission and reflection coefficients , in the limit @xmath41 ( large alfvnic mach number ) ,",
    "do not depend on @xmath42 and read @xmath43 for a typical supernova shock , the alfvnic mach number is @xmath44 , hence in the following we adopt these coefficients and neglect @xmath45 with respect to the fluid velocity in eq .",

    "we therefore have @xmath46 and thus @xmath47 .",

    "this is not the most general configuration , but it is nevertheless rather common since it occurs when : 1 ) there is only one wave train , 2 ) when the two fields are orthogonal , and 3 ) on average , when the relative phase between the wave trains is arbitrary .    at this point",
    "we normalize all quantities to the ones at upstream infinity : @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in the latter",

    "it is clear that the net effect of the magnetic turbulence is to make the fluid less compressible , noticeably reducing @xmath5 if @xmath64 is of order 1 .",

    "the compression factor lies at the intersection between the curve and the shadowed region for a given value of @xmath74 . if @xmath78 there are no intersections .",

    ". only values @xmath79 are compatible with the whole range @xmath80 inferred from observations .",
    "this means that in order to account for the inferred values of @xmath10 , the magnetic pressure must be _ at least _",
    "comparable to the gas pressure , and thus its dynamical role can not be neglected . from fig .",
    "[ fig : m100 ] one also sees that the magnetic reaction leads to values of @xmath5 lower by roughly a factor @xmath81 compared with the case @xmath75 .",

    "the growth rates of these different modes can be easily estimated only in the context of quasi - linear theory .",

    "[ fig : m100 ] .",
    "the dash - dotted and the dotted line show the results for @xmath90 and @xmath91 respectively : it is evident that the chosen values of @xmath88 allow for a consistent explanation of the downstream magnetic pressures as inferred from observations , and , equally important , lead to compression factors which are much lower than those predicted by the standard nlt ( @xcite and papers that followed ) .",
    "the strong shock modification predicted by nlt when the magnetic pressure is ignored is usually assumed to be somewhat mitigated by heating of the precursor as a result of damping of alfven waves ( @xcite , hereafter vmk81 , and mkv82 ) on the background gas .",
    "other phenomena ( for instance acoustic instability ) may also lead to heating of the precursor . in the original description , that remained basically unchanged to the present time",
    ", vmk81 assumed that the rate of damping ( @xmath92 ) equals the rate of growth ( @xmath93 ) of alfven waves .",
    "the main implication of this assumption is that the growth of the waves never reaches the non - linear regime , which is in fact the very reason why the mechanism was invoked in the 80 s .",
    "the recent observations prove that waves can grow to @xmath7 .",
    "it is therefore at least not self - consistent to apply the standard treatment for th to situations in which mf amplification to the non - linear regime takes place . in a minimal attempt to include faster growth",

    "for instance for @xmath101 and @xmath102 one requires @xmath103 to be of order unity . in this case",
    "however it is not easy to amplify the mf to @xmath104 . if @xmath103 is appreciably smaller than unity , the main process for the smoothening of the precursor is the dynamical reaction of the self - generated mf . in both cases",
    "the role of th can be seriously questioned",
    ".    a deeper look at the physical processes that may result in the heating of the precursor make the role of th even more uncertain : in the original papers of vmk81 and mkv82 the alfven heating was considered as a result of non - linear landau damping in a gas in the hot coronal phase .",
    "the authors reached the conclusion that the damping is important if @xmath105 , where @xmath9 is the shock velocity and @xmath106 is the temperature of the unshocked gas .",
    "it is all but clear whether for the velocities and temperatures that apply to the snrs in tab .",
    "[ tab ] , non - linear landau damping is such to lead to @xmath107 .",
    "we stress that at the same time , @xmath103 can not be too close to unity , otherwise th inhibits the growth of @xmath108 to the observed levels .",
    "other types of turbulent heating may be at work but a quantitative analysis of these phenomena is lacking at the present time .",
    "the expression for @xmath109 is however rather general , in that we did not specify the mathematical form of the growth and damping rates .",
    "therefore we expect to draw similar conclusions in terms of the parameter @xmath103 .",
    "this section strongly suggests that , contrary to the common wisdom , the most likely reason for the smoothening of the precursor is the dynamical reaction of the generated mfs rather than some form of non adiabatic heating in the precursor .",
    "it is well known that the effect of a mf is in general that of reducing the plasma compressibility .",
    "we showed here that when applied to a cosmic ray modified shock , 1 ) this finding implies that cr induced si is adequate to explain the magnetization inferred from x - ray observations ; 2 ) the downstream mfs imply that @xmath110 , so that the field becomes dynamically important , since this happens whenever the magnetic pressure upstream becomes comparable with the gas pressure , namely when @xmath111 ; 3 ) the dynamical reaction of the mf reduces the compression in the precursor , leading to smaller ( larger ) values of @xmath5 ( @xmath60 ) in agreement with the values required to explain the distance between forward and reverse shock and the multifrequency observations of several snrs ; 4 ) this effect comes from first principles , though in our calculations we restricted our attention to the case of alfven waves , and is not affected by the huge uncertainties typical of th ; 5 ) an efficient th may smoothen the precursor if @xmath103 is close to unity , but in this case it is likely to inhibit the growth of the field to @xmath112 .",
    "although the underlying physics is well known , the dynamical effect of the magnetic pressure has not been included in the calculations of multifrequency emission from snrs ( @xcite and successive papers ) , so that the strong modifications predicted by nlt had to be compensated by assuming th .",
    "the only exception that we are aware of is the recent work by @xcite , in which the authors perform monte carlo simulations of the particle acceleration process including the pressure of self - generated mfs . in such simulations , which represent the state of the art in the field ,",
    "however , thermal and accelerated particles are treated in the same way , therefore the condition @xmath113 could not be tested .",
    "we suspect that for this reason the smoothening of the precursor was attributed mostly to the backreaction of the accelerated particles on the field through injection .",
    "this effect is certainly present but as we showed here by using only a hydrodynamical approach , the smoothening is in fact mainly due to the reaction of the magnetic pressure on the background plasma .",
    "the smoothening of the precursor also results in two important effects : 1 ) spectra of accelerated particles closer to power laws , though the concavity which is peculiar of nl dsa remains evident .",
    "2 ) the maximum momentum of accelerated particles for given mach number is predicted to be somewhat larger ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "both these effects will be discussed in detail in a forthcoming paper ."
