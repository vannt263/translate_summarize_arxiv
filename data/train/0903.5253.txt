    "from the above discussion we can say that the probability of higher charge state is larger for the two - color than that for the one - color laser field .",

    "one can find that in both cases the dipole moments along @xmath39 direction are distinct while those along @xmath40 and @xmath53 directions are very small .",

    "thus the present parameters situate our calculations above the tunnelling ionization regime .    according to the atomic hg cut - off law , @xmath61 ,",
    "the cutoff mhohg of ethylene in the one - color laser field is at 6 . from the mhohg spectrum in fig .",
    "[ hhg](c ) we can find a clearly cut - off at the 9th order .",
    "although this value is not exactly the same as the value predicted by the atomic hg cut - off law , it is quite near and we attribute the difference to the fact that ethylene is polyatomic molecule while the cut - off law is for atoms .",
    "one can also find in fig .",
    "[ hhg](c ) that the mhohg spectrum of ethylene consists of a series of peaks , first decreasing in amplitude and then reaching a plateau .",
    "the plateaus is rather short from the 5th order harmonic to the 9th order followed by continuously decrease .",
    "thus the mhohg spectrum of ethylene behaves basically like an atom with recollision of the electron with the compact molecular ion being the principal hg mechanism .",
    "furthermore , one can find in fig .",
    "[ hhg](c ) that ethylene generates odd harmonics .",

    "[ hhg](c ) , we can see that the shapes of mhohg spectrum are different . in fig .",
    "[ hhg](d ) , the plateaus is not so obvious and the decrease lasts longer .",
    "this is due to the interference effect of the @xmath62 and @xmath63 components of the two - color laser field .",
    "it can also be found that even harmonics are well produced in the two - color case .",
    "one explanation of this is that even harmonic results from the sum of an odd number of @xmath63 photon plus two @xmath62 photons .",
    "the other interpretation is that even harmonic generation requires broken reflection symmetry because only this allows that even harmonic generation transforms a squared dipole excitation into one dipole signal , i.e. , @xmath64 .",
    "that transition can not be mediated by a reflection symmetric system because parity is then conserved , but @xmath65 has negative parity while @xmath66 has positive parity .",
    "ethylene is symmetric and a two - color laser field breaks the symmetry so that a series of even harmonics are produced .",
    ".,width=302 ]    to investigate the detailed temporal structure of the mhohg spectrum of ethylene , we perform the gabor transform of the dipole moments in the one - color and the two - color laser field respectively .",
    "the laser parameters are the same as those in fig .",
    "[ escelectron ] . here",
    "we consider two typical harmonics which are both in the plateau , one is odd harmonic ( 5th ) and the other one is even harmonic ( 6th ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ harmonics ] .",
    "it should be noted that the optical cycle refers to the one - color laser frequency . in fig .",
    "[ harmonics](a ) we can find that in the one - color laser field , the time profile of the 5th harmonic shows a relative smooth function of the driving laser pulse which indicates that the multiphoton mechanism dominates this lower harmonic regime . however , for the two - color case , the time profile of the 5th harmonic is stronger and it exhibits well the one burst within each optical cycle from the 5th optical cycle to the 25th optical cycle .",
    "this can be attributed to the recollision of the electronic wave packet with the ionic cores . due to the first five and",
    "the final five optical cycles are ramp - on and ramp - off times of laser pulses , there are only two and four bursts in these two parts of times . for the 6th harmonic , as shown in fig .",
    "[ harmonics](b ) , it is obvious that in the one - color laser field , the time profile of the 6th harmonic is very weak , whereas in the two - color laser field , it is almost two orders of magnitude stronger . again , it shows well the one burst within each optical cycle from the 5th optical cycle to the 25th optical cycle .",
    "in this paper , we have simulated the mhohg spectra and ionization of ethylene induced by the one - color and the two - color laser fields in the multiphoton regimes with tdlda .",
