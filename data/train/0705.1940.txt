    "these materials are either neutral or ionic , but under the influence of pressure or temperature certain neutral compounds become ionic .",
    "there is a competition between the energy required for the formation of a d@xmath76a@xmath20 pair and the madelung energy .",
    "neutral - ionic ( ni ) phase transitions are collective , one - dimensional charge - transfer phenomena occurring in mixed - stack charge - transfer crystals , and they are associated to many intriguing phenomena , as the dramatic increase in conductivity and dielectric constant at the transition , such as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ttf - caepsilon ] @xcite .    in the simplest case the charge per molecule changes from completely neutral @xmath77 to fully ionized @xmath78 . ideally",
    "this redistribution of charge is decoupled from the lattice , and therefore should not change the inter - molecular spacing . in most real cases ,",
    "however , the ni transition is characterized by the complex interplay between the average ionicity @xmath79 on the molecular sites and the stack dimerization @xmath80 .",
    "the ionicity may act as an order parameter only in the case of discontinuous , first order phase transitions .",
    "while the inter - site coulomb     temperature dependent dielectric constant @xmath81 of ttf - ca measured at a frequency of 30 khz ( after @xcite ) .",

    "intramolecular ( holstein ) phonons , on the other hand , modulate the on - site energy @xmath51 and favor a discontinuous jump in @xmath79 .    in terms of a modified , one - dimensional hubbard model [ similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : hubbard ] ) ] , the ni transition can be viewed as a transition from a band insulator to a mott insulator , due to the competition between the energy difference between donor and acceptor sites , and the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath51 .",
    "peierls and holstein phonons are both coupled to charge transfer electrons , albeit before the ni transition the former are only infrared active , and the latter only raman active .",
    "this makes polarized raman and reflection measurements a suitable tool to explore the ni transition .",

    "the room temperature spectrum ( black line ) is replotted in the lowest frame ( after @xcite).,width=226 ]    the vibronic bands present in the infrared spectra for @xmath84 are combination modes involving the lattice mode , which gives rise to the peierls distortion at the transition .",
    "from calculations we expect three lattice modes which couple to electrons and become stronger as the transition is approached .",

    "a clear identification and theoretical modelling of the goldstone mode is still an open problem because the system has several degrees of freedom coupled to each other .",
    "the cooperative charge transfer among the constructive molecules of ttf - ca can also be induced by irradiation of a short laser pulse .",
    "a photoinduced local charge - transfer excitation triggers the phase change and cause the transition in both directions @xcite . when cl is replaced by br in the tetrahalo-_p_-benzoquinones the lattice is expanded , ( like a negative pressure ) and the ionic phase vanishes completely .",
    "hydrostatic pressure or br - cl substitution is utilized as a control parameter to tune the ni transition more or less continuously at @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "no doubt , one - dimensional physics matured from a toy model to an extremely active field of theoretical and experimental research , spanning a broad range from quantum gases to condensed - matter physics and semiconductor technology . several novel and exciting phenomena can be investigated in these systems . in one - dimensional metals",
    "collective modes replace the single - particle excitations common to three - dimensional conductors and described by landau s fermi liquid concept of interaction electrons .",
    "another property typical for low - dimensional solids is their susceptibility to symmetry breaking with respect to the lattice , the charge and the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "broken - symmetry ground states imply that the system becomes stiff , because the modulation of the order parameter costs energy ; therefore collective modes appear at low energies . in the case of magnets ,",
    "the broken rotational symmetry leads to a magnetic stiffness and spin waves . in superconductors",
    "the gauge symmetry is broken , but due to the higgs mechanism the goldstone mode is absent at low frequencies and shifted well above the plasma frequency . in the examples",
    "above , we were dealing with translational symmetry , which is lowered in crystals due to charge ordering phenomena .",
    "charge density waves drive a metal to an insulator , for the fermi surface becomes instable ; the pinned - mode resonance can nicely be detected in the ghz using a variety of high - frequency and optical techniques .",
    "purely electronic correlations between adjacent sites can cause charge disproportionation .",
    "organic conductors are suitable realizations to investigate the properties at the metal - insulator transitions .",
    "the neutral - ionic transition observed in mixed - stack one - dimensional organic charge - transfer salts can be a pure change of ionizity , but commonly goes hand in hand with a peierls distortion .",
    "this can be seen in a softening of the low - frequency phonon modes above the phase transition .",
    "the review is based on many years of collaboration with a large number of people ; only some of them can be mentioned here .",
