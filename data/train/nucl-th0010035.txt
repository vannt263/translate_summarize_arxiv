    "in the conventional nuclear physics we have assumed that the nucleon properties in the nuclear medium are not changed from those of the free nucleon .",
    "thus , low- and medium - energy nuclear physics phenomenology has been successfully described in terms of ( point - like ) nucleons . however , after the emc effect in the nuclear structure functions was observed  @xcite there has been considerable interest in the modification of hadron properties in the nuclear medium .",
    "it is one of the central questions in nuclear physics how the effect of the quark substructure of hadrons emerges in nuclear phenomena .    at present rigorous studies of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )",
    "are limited to matter system with high temperature and zero baryon density . because of the complex non - perturbative features of qcd it is very difficult to calculate properties of nuclei at low- and medium - energy .",
    "thus , we need to build models which help to bridge the discrepancy between nuclear phenomenology and the underlying theory . such models may be necessarily crude because the nuclear many - body problem at the fundamental qcd level is intractable",
    ". however , it is very important and intersting to challenge this problem .",
    "then , much effort has been devoted to the study of effective models for nuclear matter and finite nuclei based on various quark models  @xcite .    about a decade ago , guichon  @xcite proposed a relativistic quark model for nuclear matter , where it consists of non - overlapping nucleon bags bound by the self - consistent exchange of isoscalar , scalar ( @xmath3 ) and vector ( @xmath4 ) mesons in mean - field approximation ( mfa ) .",
    "this model has been further developed as the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the model can reproduce the saturation properties of nuclear matter and that it provides a fair description of finite nuclei ( for recent reviews , see ref.@xcite ) . since in qmc the mesons couple not to the nucleons but to the quarks directly the nucleon properties",
    "are modified self - consistently , depending on the scalar field in a medium .    on the other hand ,",
    "recent theoretical studies show that various properties of finite nuclei can be described by quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd )  @xcite very well .",
    "although the original version of qhd  @xcite provides the large reduction of the nucleon mass in nuclear matter , which is the source of the large spin - orbit splitting in finite nuclei , the model also gives the large nuclear compressibility around 550 mev . in order to improve this boguta and bodmer  @xcite first introduced self - interaction terms for the @xmath3 meson .",
    "it is now well established that such non - linear interactions are necessary to reproduce the bulk properties of finite nulcei and nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "our purpose here is to study a relation between qhd - type mean - field models and the qmc model and to examine how the internal structure of the nucleon sheds its effect on effective nuclear models . in qmc the nucleon mass in matter",
    "is given by a decreasing function of the @xmath3 field . by applying a field re - definition to the scalar field in matter",
    ", the qmc model can be cast in a form equivalent to a qhd - type model with a non - linear scalar potential and a non - linear coupling to the gradient of the scalar field  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in principle , if the effective nucleon mass is known as a function of the scalar field , it could provide a prediction of non - linear interactions of the scalar field in nuclear matter through the procedure of the field re - definition .",
    "inversely , it may imply that if a form of the scalar self - interactions in matter could be determined by analysing various experimental data we could get significant information on the quark substructure of the in - medium nucleon .",
    "the qmc model relies on the choice of a quark model of the nucleon .",
    "the mit bag model has been used as the nucleon model in our previous works  @xcite . in the bag model",
    "the inside of the bag is assumed to be the perturbative vacuum and the quark moves with a current quark mass , which is nearly zero .",
    "there is an alternative idea for the nucleon model , namely the constituent quark model  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the quark takes a constituent quark mass of about 300 mev in the nucleon , which is offered by spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "recently , shen and toki  @xcite have proposed a new version of the qmc model , where the constituent quark model with a harmonic oscillator potential was used , and studied nuclear matter and finite nuclei  they refer the model as the quark mean - field ( qmf ) model .",
    "although the quark acquires a heavy mass in this picture it is still important to treat it relativistically because the quark kinetic energy is not small compared with the constituent quark mass .",
    "hence , in this paper we will use both the bag model and the relativistic constituent quark model in qmc and study the properties of nuclear matter and self - interactions of the scalar field .",
    "the outline of the present paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : quark ] , we present relativistic quark models for the nucleon , which can be solved analytically . using those quark models",
    "we calculate the nucleon properties in sec .",
    "[ sec : qmc ] .",
    "we also present our numerical results for nuclear matter . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qhdtype ] , by performing a re - definition of the scalar field we transform the qmc model to a qhd - type model .",
    "then , we discuss non - linear scalar potentials generated from the qmc model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] we give some discussions and conclusion .",
    "in this section we summarize relativistic quark models to describe the nucleon .",
    "first we discuss the constituent quark model with a square well ( sw ) potential or a harmonic oscillator ( ho ) potential to confine the quarks .",
    "we introduce a lorentz - vector type potential as well as a scalar type one to examine the role of the vector type confining potential in nuclear matter . in the constituent quark model",
    "it is assumed that the quark moves in the nambu - goldstone vacuum and hence the quark takes a constituent quark mass ( around 300 mev ) .",
    "next , we review the mit bag model shortly . in the bag model ,",
    "the quark moves in the perturbative vacuum ( or the wigner phase ) and it takes a small , current quark mass .",
    "we consider a light ( u or d ) quark ( of mass @xmath5 ) moving under a potential @xmath6 .",
    "the dirac equation for the quark field @xmath7 is then given by @xmath8 \\psi_q(r ) = 0 , \\label{dirac}\\ ] ] where we take @xmath9 with a confining potential @xmath10 and a parameter @xmath11 to control the strength of the lorentz - vector type potential .",
    "we assume that the shape of the lorentz - scalar type confining potential is the same as that of the vector type one .",
    "we first consider a square well potential and find a solution for the quark field _",
    " la bogolioubov",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the potential is then given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the radius of the spherical well and @xmath14 is the height of the potential outside the nucleon .",
    "after finishing all calculations , we take the limit @xmath15 .",
    "the solution for the quark field can be found easily  @xcite . inside the well the lowest energy state",
    "is @xmath16 with the normalization constant @xmath17 , spin state @xmath18 and the quark energy @xmath19 . here",
    "the upper @xmath20 and lower @xmath21 components of the quark wave function are respectively given by the spherical bessel functions , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "( for details , see appendix . ) outside the nucleon volume we find a similar form of the solution with modified spherical bessel functions .",
    "note that since the quark wave function is proportional to @xmath24 outside the well the condition @xmath25 is necessary to confine the quark .",
    "we then demand that @xmath26 and @xmath27 must be continuous at @xmath28 .",
    "this gives an eigenvalue problem , and we obtain a matching condition in the limit @xmath15 : @xmath29 with the eigenvalue of the confined quark , @xmath30 .",
    "the total energy is given by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "as in the mit bag model there exist the spurious center of mass ( c.m . ) motion and gluon fluctuation corrections etc . here",
    "we add the familiar form , @xmath34 , with a parameter @xmath35 for those corrections to the energy  @xcite .",
    "thus , the nucleon mass @xmath36 ( at rest ) is given by @xmath37 using the solution eq.([qsol ] ) we can calculate various nucleon properties analytically ( see appendix ) .",
    "this system may be described by a lagrangian density @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the unit vector in time direction : @xmath40 .",
    "this lagrangian provides a boundary condition at @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the unit normal outward from the potential surface .",
    "this is equivalent to the condition eq.([bound ] ) and ensures that the quark is confined permanently .",
    "( note that actually the quark current flows in the azimuthal direction  @xcite . )    in the case where the confining potential is a harmonic oscillator potential with @xmath44 and @xmath45 the oscillator strength @xmath46 one can again find the quark wave function analytically .",
    "the solution to the dirac equation is expressed by eq.([qsol ] ) , where the upper and lower components are given in terms of gaussian functions  @xcite .",
    "( for details , see appendix . ) the condition to determine the quark energy @xmath19 is then obtained @xmath47 in the ho model the c.m .",
    "energy can be estimated exactly as in the non - relativistic harmonic oscillator .",
    "it is just one third of the total energy  @xcite .",
    "thus , the nucleon mass is @xmath48 where @xmath49 describes gluon fluctuation corrections etc .",
    "note that an equally weighted ( lorentz ) scalar - vector potential does not produce a spin - orbit splitting in the baryon spectrum , which may be consistent with the fact that the spin - orbit splitting in the observed baryon spectra is very small .      in the mit bag model the inside of the nucleon bag",
    "is considered to be the perturbative vacuum , and the quark takes a current quark mass .",
    "it requires extra energy to make a nucleon bag in which the quark moves freely , so we have to add a latent heat term to the lagrangian density eq.([swlag ] ) @xmath50 where the bag constant @xmath51 describes the energy gap between the inside and outside of the nucleon .",
    "the quark wave function and the eigenvalue condition are given by the same forms as in the sw model .",
    "thus , the nucleon mass is given as @xmath52 where the @xmath35 parameter is again introduced to take into account the sum of the c.m . and gluon fluctuation corrections etc .",
    "here we consider how eq.([dirac ] ) is modified when the nucleon is bound in static , uniformly distributed nuclear matter . in the qmc model",
    "@xcite it is assumed that each quark feels scalar @xmath53 and vector @xmath54 potentials , which are generated by the surrounding nucleons , as well as the confinement potential @xmath6 . since the typical distance between two nucleons around normal nuclear matter density ( @xmath55 @xmath56 ) is surely larger than the typical size of the nucleon ( the radius is about 0.8 fm ) , the interaction ( except for the short - range part ) between the nucleons should be colour singlet , namely a meson - exchange potential .",
    "therefore , this assumption seems appropriate when the baryon density @xmath57 is not high .",
    "( for high density , see ref .  @xcite . )",
    "if we use the mean - field approximation for the meson fields , eq.([dirac ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath58 \\psi_q(r ) = 0 .",
    "\\label{dirac2}\\ ] ] the potentials generated by the medium are constants because the matter distributes uniformly .",
    "as the nucleon is static , the time - derivative operator in the dirac equation can be replaced by the quark energy , @xmath59 .    by analogy with the procedure applied to the nucleon in qhd  @xcite , if we introduce the effective quark mass by @xmath60 , the dirac equation eq.([dirac2 ] ) can be rewritten in the same form as that in free space , with the mass @xmath61 and the energy @xmath62 , instead of @xmath5 and @xmath19 . in other words ,",
    "the vector interaction has _ no effect on the nucleon structure _ except for an overall phase in the quark wave function eq.([qsol ] ) , which gives a shift in the nucleon energy .",
    "this fact _ does not _ depend on how to choose the confinement potential @xmath6 .",
    "then , the nucleon energy ( at rest ) @xmath63 in the medium is  @xcite @xmath64 where the effective nucleon mass @xmath65 depends on _ only the scalar potential _ in the medium .",
    "this important observation was also obtained by non - local field theory model  @xcite , where a non - local @xmath3-@xmath4 model containing short distance vertex form factors is used to simulate an underlying qcd substructure .",
    "although we have discussed the qmc model using the specific model , namely the bag model , in our previous works  @xcite , the qualitative features we have found may be correct in any model in which the nucleon contains _ relativistic _",
    "quarks and the ( middle- and long - range ) attractive and ( short - range ) repulsive n - n forces have lorentz - scalar and vector characters , respectively . to confirm this point",
    "we will study nuclear matter using the quark models discussed in the previous section .    in eq.([dirac2 ] ) the scalar and vector potentials are respectively mediated by the @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons .",
    "their mean - field values are introduced by @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) is the coupling constant of the quark-@xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) meson .",
    "( we here ignore the @xmath70 meson and the coulomb field , for simplicity .",
    "for those fields , see ref .",

    "the @xmath4-n coupling constant @xmath77 is related to the corresponding quark-@xmath4 coupling constant as @xmath78  @xcite . in an uniform nuclear matter",
    "the derivative terms of the meson fields vanish because the fields do not depend on time and position .    here",
    "we consider the nucleon mass in matter further .",
    "the nucleon mass is a function of the scalar field . because the scalar field is small at low density",
    "the nucleon mass can be expanded in terms of @xmath3 @xmath79 since the interaction between the quark and the @xmath3 field is described in terms of the local scalar coupling , the derivative of @xmath65 with respect to @xmath3 is given by @xmath80 here we have defined the quark - scalar charge in the nucleon @xmath81 , which is itself a function of the scalar field , by eq.([deriv ] ) . because @xmath82 is positive , the nucleon mass decreases in matter at low density .",
    "note that since the nucleon mass is given by eq.([nmass2 ] ) in the ho model the derivative turns to @xmath83 we furthermore define the scalar - charge ratio , @xmath84 , to be @xmath85 and the @xmath3-n coupling constant @xmath86 : @xmath87 using those quantities , we find that the nucleon mass in matter is @xmath88 ( in the ho model , we find @xmath89 . ) in general , @xmath90 is a decreasing function because the quark in matter is more relativistic than in free space ( because of the attractive force due to the @xmath3 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath91 takes a negative value .",
    "if the nucleon were structureless @xmath90 would not depend on the scalar field , that is , @xmath90 would be constant ( @xmath92 ) . therefore , only the first two terms in the right hand side of eq.([nuclm2 ] )",

    "we use @xmath5 = 300 mev in the constituent quark model , while the quark is assumed to be massless in the bag model . in the sw model we set the radius of the potential to be @xmath100 fm and detrmine @xmath35 so as to fit the free nucleon mass @xmath36 (= 939 mev ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath101 is chosen to be 0 ( the confining potential is purely lorentz - scalar ) , 0.25 and 0.5 to examine the effect of lorentz - vector type confining potential .",
    "the quark eigenvalue @xmath30 can be found by solving the boundary condition eq.([bound ] ) at the potential surface . in the ho model , there are two adjustable parameters , @xmath45 and @xmath49 .",
    "those are determined so as to fit the free nucleon mass ( see eq.([nmass2 ] ) ) and the root - mean - square ( rms ) ( charge ) radius of the free nucleon : @xmath102 fm  @xcite ( see appendix ) .",

    "we found that @xmath103 @xmath56 , @xmath104 mev and @xmath105 mev for the free nucleon .",
    "in nuclear matter we keep @xmath45 and @xmath49 constant and the quark energy @xmath19 varies depending on the scalar field .    as in ref.@xcite , in the bag model the bag constant @xmath51 and the parameter @xmath35",
    "are fixed to reproduce the free nucleon mass under the condition that the nucleon mass be stationary under variation of the bag radius @xmath13 . as in the sw model , we choose the bag radius of the free nucleon to be 0.8 fm .",
    "( variations of the quark mass and the radius only lead to numerically small changes in the calculated results  @xcite . )",
    "we found @xmath106 = 170.3 mev for massless quarks . in table",
    "[ tab : param ] we list up the parameter @xmath35 , quark eigenvalue and rms radius of the free nucleon in the sw and bag models .",
    "now we are in a position to determine the coupling constants : @xmath107 and @xmath108 are fixed to fit the binding energy ( @xmath109 mev ) at the saturation density ( @xmath55 @xmath56 ) for symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the coupling constants and some calculated properties for matter are listed in table  [ tab : cc ] .",
    "we also present the ratios of the quark eigenvalue , rms radius , axial vector coupling constant ( @xmath110 ) , magnetic moment of the proton ( @xmath111 ) and quark - scalar charge at saturation density to those in free space .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "@xcite . for explicit expressions of those quantities , see appendix . )",
    "we note that the present quark models ( except b(0.25 ) and b(0.5 ) ) provide the similar results in the properties of the in - medium nucleon and nuclear matter .",
    "in particular , they give values for the nuclear compressibility well within the experimental range ( @xmath112 200  300 mev ) , which is caused by the non - linear dependence of the @xmath3 field on the nucleon mass .",
    "in the cases of b(0.25 ) and b(0.5 ) the reduction of the nucleon mass in matter is relatively small , which is due to the strong lorentz - vector type confining potential .",
    "furthermore , in the ho model the increase of the rms radius at saturation density is about 10% , which is large compared with the observed value  @xcite .",
    "we briefly comment on the rms radius , axial vector coupling constant and magnetic moment of the nucleon in nuclear matter . in our calculation",
    "those quantities are calculated using only the ( valence ) quark wave function and other important contributions from the meson ( mainly pion ) cloud effect etc are not included .",
    "in the present quark picture those quantities involve integrals over the lower and upper components of the quark wave function . because of the attractive force due to the scalar field the quark becomes more relativistic in matter than in free space , that is , the lower component is more enhanced in matter .",
    "this fact gives the decrease in @xmath110 and the increase in the rms radius and @xmath111 in matter .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : etot ] we present the total energy per nucleon as a function of nuclear density . around normal nuclear matter density",
    "the quark models provide the similar saturation curves , while for high density the curves obtained from the models of b(0.25 ) and b(0.5 ) are relatively lower than those of the others .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that a quark model with a larger value of @xmath101 gives a lower nuclear compressibility ( see table  [ tab : cc ] ) .",
    "we show the scalar mean - field value and the effective nucleon mass for symmetric nuclear matter in figs .",
    "[ fig : gsig ] and [ fig : nmass ] , respectively . from those figures",
    "we again see that in the cases of b(0.25 ) and b(0.5 ) the scalar field is much weaker than those given by the other quark models and the decrease of the nucleon mass is fairly small even at high density , which is due to the small scalar field .",
    "we note that in the sw and bag models with massless quarks the quark - scalar charge vanishes in the limit @xmath113 , which means that the @xmath3 meson does not couple to the nucleon .",
    "( for details , see appendix . )",
    "this fact implies that as @xmath101 is larger the @xmath3-n coupling is weaker in matter .",
    "thus , we may conclude that qualitatively a large mixture of the lorentz - vector type confining potential leads to a weak scalar mean - field and a large effective nucleon mass in nuclear matter .",
    "it is well known that within mfa a smaller effective nucleon mass ( and hence a stronger scalar field ) in matter is favorable to fit various properties of finite nuclei  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the confining potential including a strong lorentz - vector type one may not be suitable for describing a nuclear system .",
    "the main difference between the qmc and qhd models lies in the dependence of the scalar field on the nucleon mass in matter . by performing a re - definition of the scalar field",
    ", the qmc lagrangian density at hadronic level can be cast into a form silimar to a qhd - type mean - field model , in which the nucleon mass depends on the scalar field linearly , with self - interactions of the scalar field  @xcite . here",
    "we will briefly review the field re - definition and discuss , as an example , the derivative ( scalar ) coupling model of qhd ( i.e. , the zimanyi - moszkowski ( zm ) model )  @xcite .",
    "then , we will calculate non - linear scalar potentials generated from the qmc model and compare with the potentials phenomenologically determined by fitting the properties of finite nuclei and nuclear matter .      in the qmc model",
    "the nucleon mass in matter is given by a function of the scalar field @xmath3 @xmath114 while in qhd the mass depends on a scalar field @xmath115 linearly , @xmath116 this fact suggests a re - definition of the scalar field in qmc : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is a constant chosen so as to normalize the new scalar field @xmath115 in the limit @xmath119 : @xmath120 thus , @xmath118 is given by @xmath121 comparing with eqs.([deriv ] ) and ( [ cn ] ) , we find @xmath122 for the sw and bag models and @xmath123 for the ho model .",
    "the contribution of the scalar field to the total energy , @xmath124 , is now rewritten in terms of the new field @xmath115 . from eq.([qmclag ] ) we find @xmath125 = \\int d\\vec{r } \\ [ \\frac{1}{2}h(\\phi)^2(\\nabla \\phi)^2 + u_s(\\phi ) ] , \\label{es}\\ ] ] where @xmath126 describes the self - interactions of the scalar field @xmath127 and @xmath128 note that in uniformly distributed nuclear matter the first derivative term in @xmath124 does not contribute to the total energy .",

    "the qmc model is now re - formulated in terms of the new scalr field @xmath115 , and it is of the same form as a qhd model with the non - linear scalar potential @xmath129 , which is generated from the effect of the internal structure of the nucleon , and with the coupling @xmath130 to the gradient of the scalar field .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that this re - formulation is performed only at hadronic level and that the non - linear potential @xmath126 is simply determined so as to simulate the effective nucleon mass given by the quark model in matter .",
    "thus , _ only on the energy of nuclear matter _ the qhd - type mean - field model derived here is identical to the qmc model .",
    "we will again discuss this point in the last section .",
    "the standard form of the non - linear scalar potential is  @xcite @xmath131 in more sophisticated version of qhd  @xcite , inspired by modern methods of effective field theory , many other terms of meson - meson and meson - nucleon couplings are considered .",
    "however , rather than attempting to compete with those models , in this paper we concentrate only on the parameters @xmath132 and @xmath133 to make our discussion simple .",
    "it is well known that the non - linear scalar potential eq.([stus ] ) is practically indispensable to reproduce the bulk properties of finite nuclei and nuclear matter  @xcite .    if the effective nucleon mass could be determined experimentally as a function of the scalar field , this procedure leading to eq.([us ] )",
    "would allow to predict a part of the non - linear potential , which is originated by the quark substructure of the nucleon in nuclear matter .",
    "inversely , if the non - linear potential obtained by fitting various experimental data could be separated into a portion due to the effect of the internal structure of the nucleon and the inherent self - interaction part of the scalar field , we could get significant information on the quark structure of the nucleon in matter by using the inverse field transformation , @xmath134 it is potentially of very interesting",
    ". however , it may be quite difficult .",
    "as an example , we here consider the derivative coupling model of qhd , namely the zimanyi - moszkowski ( zm ) model  @xcite .",

    "is given by  @xcite @xmath135 in addition to a similar coupling to the vector field .",
    "then , after rescaling the nucleon field , the lagrangian density turns to be the same form as that of the original qhd , with the effective nucleon mass @xmath136 instead of the mass depending on the scalar field linearly .",
    "thus , the model involves higher order couplings between the @xmath3 and the nucleon , which provides a good nuclear compressibility around 230 mev and @xmath137  @xcite .",
    "let us define a new scalar field @xmath115 by @xmath138 where the mass @xmath139 is given by eq.([zmmass ] ) .",

    "[ fig : potqmc ] we can see that the various quark models lead to the similar non - linear potentials , despite of the big difference in the confinement mechanism . it may imply that we can not discriminate the quark models for the nucleon only from the point of view of the energy of nuclear matter . on the other hand , the non - linear potentials in the rmf models show quite different behaviors in fig .",
    "[ fig : potrmf ] . in the region of @xmath165 the potentials in the g2 , nlb and zm models are close to those produced by qmc .",
    "we here comment on the coupling @xmath130 to the gradient of the scalar field .",
    "the qmc model gives @xmath166 where @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "we find that the present model suggests @xmath169 and @xmath170 , while the zm model gives @xmath171 and @xmath172 . in the rmf model , for example ,",
    "the g1 and g2 models lead to @xmath173 , which is consistent with the values obtained in qmc .",
    "this coupling @xmath130 affects the surface properties of finite nuclei  @xcite .",
    "we have first studied the mit bag model and the relativistic constituent quark model for the nucleon , where a square well and harmonic oscillator potentials are used to confine the quarks .",
    "we have considered not only the lorentz - scalar type confining potential but also the lorentz - vector type one in order to study the role of the vector potential in nuclear matter .",
    "then , we have calculated the properties of the nucleon and nuclear matter using qmc with those quark models . as a mixture of the lorentz - vector type",
    "confining potential is larger the effective nucleon mass in matter is larger and the strength of the scalar field is weaker . in particular , it is preferable in the bag model that the lorentz structure of the confinement is purely scalar ( or including a very weak lorentz - vector type potential ) .",
    "next , we have performed a re - definition of the scalar field in matter and transformed the qmc model to a qhd - type model with a non - linear scalar potential .",
    "we then compared our results with the potentials which are determined so as to fit the properties of finite nuclei and nuclear matter in the rmf models .",
    "the qmc model provides the parameters @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath2 for the non - linear scalar potential .",
    "the shapes of the potentials generated from qmc are thus very close to one another , despite of the different confinement mechanism in the quark models .",
    "on the other hand , the parameters phenomenologically determined in the rmf models take various values and the shapes of the potentials are quite different . in general , the phenomenological potential may consist of a part , which is caused by the quark substructure of the nucleon , and the inherent self - couplings of the scalar field",
    ". therefore , if the part due to the internal structure of the nucleon could be known by nuclear experiments , we could get significant information on the quark structure of the in - medium nucleon .",
    "we should emphasize that the field re - definition performed here enables us to make a qhd - type effective lagrangian from the qmc model .",
    "however , the created lagrangian is identical to the qmc model _ only on the energy of a nuclear system_. in qmc the quark wave function in the nucleon is modified by the nuclear environment self - consistently at each nuclear density .",
    "we can know it explicitly .",
    "it is the big difference between the qhd - type and qmc models , and is of great advantage to the qmc model . using the change of the quark wave function in the medium provided by qmc we can explain many intriguing nuclear phenomena  @xcite , for example , the nuclear emc effect  @xcite , charge symmetry breaking in nuclei ( the okamoto - nolen - schiffer anomaly )  @xcite , change of electromagnetic form factors of the bound nucleon  @xcite , longitudinal response functions in electron scattering  @xcite etc .",
    "we have one comment on the modified quark - meson coupling ( mqmc ) model proposed by jin and jennings  @xcite .",
    "the original qmc model  @xcite generates a ( relatively ) small scalar field in nuclear matter . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that the mqmc model can generate the scalar field , which is close to that in qhd ( see also ref .",
    "however , unfortunately the increase of the nucleon size at @xmath174 is about 40% of the free - space value , which is apparently too large  @xcite . although it must be true that the bag constant decreases as the density grows up , the reduction of the bag constant around normal nuclear matter density may not be large .",
    "for example , the dyson - schwinger approach at finite chemical potential  @xcite suggested that the bag constant is reduced very little at @xmath174 , while it decreases very rapidly near the phase transition point .",
    "it is possible to extend the present qmc model to a model which includes quark degrees of freedom in the mesons , as well as in the nucleons  we call it qmc - ii  @xcite .",
    "the qmc - ii model can provide a lot of effective coupling terms among the meson fields because the mesons have structure .",
    "in particular , the qmc - ii lagrangian automatically offers non - linear terms with respect to the meson fields .",
    "those interaction terms may correspond to the terms of meson - meson and meson - nucleon couplings considered in the new version of qhd  @xcite or higher order terms appearing in the chiral effective lagrangian for nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "it will be very interesting to construct a qmc model , in which both the quark substructure of hadrons and non - linear potentials due to inherent self - couplings of the meson fields are involved ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and explore the connection between various coupling strengths found empirically in the phenomenological models and those predicted in the qmc model .      in the relativistic quark models we adopt here the lowest energy state for the confined quark",
    "is given by eq.([qsol ] ) .",
    "in the sw model the upper and lower components of the quark wave function inside the well are respectively given by the spherical bessel functions : @xmath175 and @xmath176 , where @xmath177 , @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "the normalization constant is then given by @xmath180 where @xmath181 .",
    "using those quantities the quark - scalar charge @xmath82 is calculated @xmath182 we note that @xmath82 vanishes if @xmath183 mev and @xmath113 , which may be accidental in the sw and bag models . in this case",
    "there is no coupling between the @xmath3 meson and the nucleon , which implies that the nuclear matter can not be described by this model .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) ( charge ) radius of the nucleon is given by @xmath184 where @xmath185 - 3\\lambda \\left[\\lambda(1 + 2\\beta)-x^2\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2 } -\\frac{3}{2 } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + & 2\\alpha \\lambda \\left[\\left(x^2 - \\frac{3}{4}\\right ) \\beta -2\\right ] .",
    "\\label{numrms}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the axial vector coupling constant ( @xmath110 ) and the magnetic moment ( @xmath186 ) of the nucleon are also calculated analytically . in the present quark model @xmath110",
    "is given by @xmath187 , where the factor @xmath188 is the expectation value of the spin - isospin operator with respect to the nucleon state .",
    "then , @xmath189 is @xmath190 the magnetic moment is given by @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is the quark charge operator and the sum @xmath193 runs over all quarks in the nucleon .",
