    "in nanoscale devices shot noise ( i.e. the noise due to the discreteness of the electron charge ) is often suppressed with respect to the value of power spectral density given by the schottky formula @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the elementary charge and @xmath2 is the average current ) , which would be expected in the absence of correlations between the carriers  @xcite .",
    "the ratio that quantifies this suppression , due to the correlations introduced by coulomb interactions or ( as in the cases discussed in this article ) by fermi exclusion , is called fano factor .",
    "particularly interesting is the case of diffusive conductors .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that , if the length @xmath3 of the device is much less than the elastic mean free path @xmath4 , the transport regime is ballistic and shot noise is strongly suppressed , while , if @xmath3 is greater than @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the number of propagating modes ) and the conductor is assumed to be phase coherent ( as we will do in this work ) , transport is characterized by strong localization , with the resistance increasing exponentially with the length of the device and the fano factor approaching unity . instead , in the intermediate regime in which the values of @xmath4 ( determined by the disorder inside the device ) , @xmath3 and @xmath6 satisfy the inequalities @xmath7 , transport is diffusive . in this regime",
    "the resistance increases linearly with length and , being the distribution of the transmission eigenvalues @xmath8 bimodal and proportional to @xmath9 , shot noise is suppressed by a factor 1/3 , due to the presence of a few open quantum channels with nearly unit transmission probability  @xcite .",
    "this result , in the case of devices with more than one - dimensional disorder , has been theoretically obtained using quantum - mechanical  @xcite or semiclassical  @xcite approaches , both of which include the effect of fermi exclusion .",
    "the same result has been obtained in the case of one - dimensional disorder ( i.e. a series of unevenly spaced tunnel barriers ) using a semiclassical model  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will try to answer the question whether in semiconductor devices with mesoscopic dimensions it is possible to reach the diffusive transport regime and thus the corresponding 1/3 suppression of shot noise over a wide parameter range .    from the experimental point of view , henny _ et al . _",
    "@xcite measured the shot noise suppression factor in a thin metallic wire , finding the theoretically predicted 1/3 reduction by asymptotically widening the contact reservoirs and thus reducing the reservoir heating which otherwise would increase the measured noise .",
    "instead , in the case of semiconductor devices , the existing experimental data are not conclusive .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite reported , for a wire obtained confining the two - dimensional electron gas of a gaas / algaas heterostructure , shot noise reduction factors varying between 0.2 and 0.45 , depending on the width of the wire .",
    "instead song _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have measured the fano factor for a semiconductor device with one - dimensional disorder , in particular for a superlattice in which carriers have been injected into the conduction band through optical excitations from the valence band .",
    "also in this case , for low applied fields , the measured fano factor has values that strongly differ from 1/3 , varying from one superlattice to another and in particular typically increasing with barrier width ( i.e. decreasing barrier transparency ) .    prompted by these results",
    ", we have performed several numerical investigations of the noise behavior of semiconductor structures characterized by 2-dimensional ( 2d ) and one - dimensional ( 1d ) disorder , using different models , with varying degree of approximation . in the case of 2d disorder ,",
    "our conclusion is that in a semiconductor device with mesoscopic dimensions it is very difficult to obtain a diffusive behavior over a relatively large range of scatterer concentration or disorder strength : in order to reach such a result in a definite way , we should increase the number of propagating modes up to several thousands and thus consider a macroscopic device . on the other hand , in the case of 1d disorder we have found that the absence of coupling among the modes propagating in the structure makes it inherently impossible to obtain a diffusive regime , and thus a 1/3 fano factor , unless some additional contribution ( such as a magnetic field ) is introduced to create mode mixing .",
    "the structure we consider is a quantum wire obtained laterally confining , by means of negatively biased gates located on the surface , the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) of a gaas / algaas heterostructure .",
    "the ionized donors located inside the n - doped algaas layer ( together with other charged impurities present inside the heterostructure ) determine potential fluctuations at the 2deg level .    in a previous paper by our group  @xcite a self - consistent calculation of the average potential , combined with a semi - analytical formula for the effect of ionized donors ,",
    "was used to fit the conductance measurement on a fabricated quantum wire and to numerically predict its noise behavior . in that case",
    "it was found that the fano factor did not stabilize at 1/3 , but it rather crossed it for a single value of the gate bias voltage .    in order to gain a better understanding of the problem , we have now studied the noise behavior of the structure for a larger range of parameters , for some choices of a model potential . in detail , we have considered a 4.9  @xmath10 m long and 8.4  @xmath10 m wide conductor with a hard - wall lateral confinement ( since in our previous investigations the detailed shape of the confinement potential did not appear to play a significant role on the noise behavior ) .",
    "we have considered that all of the dopants are located at a distance @xmath11  nm from the 2deg and , for each considered dopant concentration ( with a uniform random distribution ) , we have initially evaluated the effect , at the level of the 2deg , by summing up each individual contribution .",
    "the contribution of a single dopant has been evaluated with the semi - analytical expression given by stern and howard  @xcite , according to which a point charge @xmath12 located at a distance @xmath13 from the 2deg generates on the 2deg , at a distance @xmath14 from its orthogonal projection onto the 2deg plane , a screened potential equal to @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the vacuum permittivity , @xmath17 is the relative permittivity of the semiconductor , @xmath18 is the bessel function of order 0 and the screening constant is assumed equal to @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 the considered subband degeneracy ) . in order to have a neutral system with a potential landscape symmetric around zero , which simplifies the investigation and comparison of a large number of different cases , we have considered an artificial situation with an equal number of positive and negative charges .",
    "then , different disorder strengths for each dopant concentration have been obtained simply by multiplying the thus obtained potential profile by a scale factor @xmath21 , thereby reducing the computational effort .    as an example , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show a map of the potential obtained at the 2deg level for a concentration @xmath22  m@xmath23 of impurities located at a distance @xmath11  nm from the 2deg , multiplied by a disorder strength scale factor @xmath24 .",

    "the conductance @xmath26 , the shot noise power spectral density @xmath27 and the fano factor @xmath28 have been obtained using the relations  @xcite : @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the mean value of the externally applied voltage , @xmath32 is planck s constant and the @xmath33 s are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath34 .    in these calculations we have separately averaged the conductance and noise results ( and thus the numerator and denominator of eq .",

    "[ fig2 ] we report the fano factor that we have obtained for 7 values of the dopant concentration @xmath36 , as a function of the disorder strength scale factor @xmath21 .",
    "we see that for elevated concentrations the interval of disorder strength within which the curves approach the value 1/3 is very narrow , while it gets wider for low concentrations .",
    "however , in this latter case the diffusive behavior is obtained only for very large scale factors @xmath21 .",
    "if we focus our attention on the potential deriving , at the 2deg level , from each single charged impurity and in particular on the portion that more affects transport , i.e. that above the fermi energy , we see that for these values of @xmath21 its spatial extent is of the order of hundreds of nanometers .",
    "since this extension is unrealistic for semiconductor devices ( while it could be reasonable for metallic conductors , characterized by the presence of large grains ) , we conclude that in semiconductor nano - devices it is quite unlikely to obtain a 1/3 shot noise suppression factor within a reasonably large parameter range .",
    "finally , for the lowest concentration ( @xmath37  m@xmath23 ) the fano factor remains well below the 1/3 value and thus we have a substantially ballistic regime for all the considered disorder strengths .     for 7 values of the dopant concentration @xmath36 and for @xmath35  mev.,width=472",

    "we again observe that the interval in which the condition for diffusive transport is satisfied is very narrow for elevated concentrations , while it widens for low concentrations , for which , however , large disorder strengths are needed .",

    "[ fig3 ] confirms that the fano factor assumes values near 1/3 in the same parameter range in which the condition @xmath7 is satisfied .",
    "this range can clearly be enlarged increasing the number @xmath6 of propagating modes , but this can be obtained only considering wider conductors , with macroscopic dimensions , thus outside the mesoscopic range we are interested in .    in the case of metallic conductors , due to the higher number of propagating modes and to the possibility of extended scatterers ,",
    "diffusive transport can actually be reached and experimentally measured .",
    "finally , in order to compare these conclusions with some previously obtained results  @xcite , we have performed some simulations using a more simplified model for the disordered potential . in detail , in ref .",
    "@xcite a discussion on the exact conditions needed to obtain the diffusive transport regime was presented , considering wires where the disordered potential was simulated with a random distribution of square obstacles .",

    "we show the fano factor as a function of the fermi energy of the impinging electrons .",

    "[ fig4 ] we show the behavior of the fano factor as a function of the number of square scatterers inside the conductor .",
    "we see that also in this case the fano factor does not settle around 1/3 for a large range of scatterer numbers , but just crosses the 1/3 value in correspondence of about 300 scatterers , which is indeed the situation for which the conditions for diffusive regime have been investigated in ref .",
    "thus , this was a particular case , not representative of the general behavior .",
    "the case of strictly one - dimensional disorder  @xcite , i.e. of unevenly spaced tunnel barriers located in an otherwise purely ballistic device with any dimensionality , is a bit different from the cases of 2d or 3d disorder , even though , according to a semiclassical study of this structure  @xcite , also in this case the shot noise suppression factor should approach 1/3 as the number of cascaded barriers is let go to infinity .",
    "a series of barriers can be defined , for example , in a heterostructure - based device defining a series of gates on the surface of the device .",
    "such gates , when negatively biased , locally deplete the 2deg , each generating a tunnel barrier for the electrons traveling in the device .",
    "we consider , for simplicity , idealized rectangular barriers , although we have verified that the main results hold also for realistic barriers  @xcite .",
    "since a wire with a series of such rectangular transversal barriers ( each extending across the whole cross - section ) can be seen as made up of a series of sections differing only for the value of their constant potential , the wave functions associated with the transverse modes are the same in all of the sections and the tunnel barriers do not introduce any mode - mixing .",
    "therefore the transport calculation can be subdivided into many purely 1d problems . using a scattering matrix approach ,",
    "in which the scattering matrix of each barrier and of each interbarrier region has a well - known analytical form , we have found the transmission @xmath49 for each mode @xmath50 through the device .",
    "the conductance , shot noise power spectral density and fano factor can then be obtained using eqs .",

    "we have averaged the results over 50 different sets of interbarrier distances , which is equivalent to introducing dephasing with a simple phase randomization model preserving localization effects  @xcite .",
    "these averages show that , contrary to what was expected from a semiclassical analysis  @xcite , no common asymptotic 1/3 value for the fano factor is reached increasing the number of barriers .",

    "@xcite we have also shown that the presence of a realistic amount of edge - roughness in the depletion gates defining the barriers , introducing only a small degree of mode - mixing , does not alter significantly the described results .",
    "on the other hand , the amount of 2d disorder that we should add to the device in order to create mode - mixing and reach the diffusive regime would be such that it would lead to diffusive transport even in the absence of the barriers , and therefore of the 1d disorder .    therefore , in order to reach the diffusive regime while preserving the 1d nature of the disorder , we have to introduce a different source of mode - mixing , for example a magnetic field threading the device .",
    "we have shown elsewhere  @xcite that , especially in the case of barriers with high transparency , the presence of a magnetic field makes it possible to reach a 1/3 value for the fano factor , by introducing mode - mixing and thus increasing the localization length with respect to the mean free path .    here",
