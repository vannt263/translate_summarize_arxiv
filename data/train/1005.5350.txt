    "the studies of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite and nonlinear optics @xcite keep drawing a great deal of attention due to experimental advances in versatile realizations of such systems , as well as considerable progress in the analysis of relevant models based on the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) -type equations",
    ". one of remarkable features specific to these fields is the possibility of tailoring particular configurations by dint of suitably designed magnetic and/or optical trapping mechanisms ( possibly acting in a combination ) that confine the atoms in the case of bec , or virtual ( photonic ) and material structures manipulating the transmission of light in nonlinear optical media .",
    "these achievements motivate the detailed examination of the existence , stability and dynamical behavior of nonlinear modes in the form of matter or optical waves .",
    "the nls equation @xcite , as well as its variant known as the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite in the bec context are often at the center of such analysis .    within the diverse range of external confinement mechanisms , one that has attracted particular attention",
    "is that provided by double - well potentials ( dwps ) .",
    "its prototypical realization in the context of bec relies on the combination of a parabolic ( harmonic ) trap with a periodic potential , which can be created , as an  optical lattice \" , by the interference of laser beams illuminating the condensate @xcite .",
    "the use of a dwp created as a trap for bec ( with the intrinsic self - repulsive nonlinearity ) has revealed a wealth of new phenomena in recent experiments @xcite , including the tunneling and josephson oscillations for small numbers of atoms in the condensate , and macroscopic quantum self - trapped states for large atom numbers .",
    "prior to this work , as well as afterwards , motivated by its findings , a wide range of theoretical studies investigated such dwp settings , including such issues as finite - mode reductions and symmetry - breaking bifurcations @xcite , quantum effects @xcite , and nonlinear variants of the dwp @xcite .",
    "dwp settings and spontaneous - symmetry - breaking ( ssb ) effects in them have also been studied in nonlinear - optical settings , such as formation of asymmetric states in dual - core fibers @xcite , self - guided laser beams in kerr media @xcite , and optically - induced dual - core waveguiding structures in photorefractive crystals @xcite .",
    "one of recent developments in both fields of matter and optical waves is the study of effects of long - range nonlinear interactions . in the bec",
    "these studies are dealing with condensates formed by magnetically polarized @xmath0cr atoms @xcite ( see recent review @xcite ) , dipolar molecules hetmol , or atoms in which electric moments are induced by a strong external field @xcite .",
    "matter - wave solitons supported by the dipole - dipole interactions were predicted in isotropic @xcite , anisotropic @xcite , and discrete @xcite two - dimensional ( 2d ) settings , and in the quasi-1d configurations sinha , us ( the latter was done not only in bec , but also in a model of the tonks - girardeau gas @xcite ) . in optics , prominent examples of patterns supported by long - range effects are stable vortex rings predicted in media with the thermal nonlocal nonlinearity @xcite , as well as the experimental realization of elliptically shaped spatial solitons in these media @xcite .",
    "our aim in the present work is to examine effects of long - range interactions in the context of dwps .",
    "this is a topic of increasing current interest ; in the context of dipolar multi - dimensional condensates , it was recently addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the phase diagram of the system was explored , as a function of the strength of the barrier in the dwp , number of atoms , and aspect ratio of the system .",
    "the possibility of a transition from a symmetric state to an asymmetric one , and finally to an unstable higher - dimensional configuration was considered . here ,",
    "we focus on the 1d setting , and explore different types of long - range interactions , including the dipole - dipole interactions , as motivated by refs .",
    "@xcite , as well as the interactions with gaussian and exponential kernels , motivated by nonlinear - optical models @xcite .",
    "in particular , we consider the effect of the range of the interaction , with the objective to consider a transition from the contact interactions to progressively longer - range ones .",
    "we conclude that the phenomenology of the short - range interactions persists , i.e. , the earlier discovered ssb phenomena bergeman_2mode , todd , theo , shliz still arise in the present context .",
    "however , the critical point of the ssb transitions features a definite , monotonically increasing , dependence on the interaction range , which is considered in a systematic way .",
    "more elaborate scenarios can be detected in the case where in addition to the long - range interactions , there is a competing short - range component .",
    "in such a case , we identify not only the earlier symmetry - breaking bifurcations but also reverse , `` symmetry - restoring '' bifurcations , as well as the potential for symmetry - breaking to arise ( for the same parameters ) both from the symmetric and from the antisymmetric solution branch . both of these are phenomena that , to the best of our knowledge , have not been reported previously .",
    "interestingly , the only example where subcritical bifurcations have been previously discussed in the double well setting for gp equations is the very recent one of extremely ( and hence somewhat unphysically ) high nonlinearity exponents in @xcite .",
    "the presentation is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the model and the quasi - analytical two - mode approximation , which clearly reveals the system s bifurcation properties . in section iii ,",
    "we corroborate these analytical predictions by full numerical results for different types of the long - range kernel . in section iv",
    ", we consider a more general case , in which the long - range nonlinear repulsion competes with the local attraction .",
    "there , we illustrate how the competition strongly affects the character of the ssb in the dwp setting .",
    "finally , in section v , summarize our findings and present our conclusions .",
    "in the quasi-1d setting , the normalized mean - field wave function @xmath1 obeys the scaled gp equation , @xmath2 \\,\\,\\psi , \\label{eq1}\\]]where @xmath3 is the chemical potential , and @xmath4is the usual single - particle energy operator , which includes the confining dwp @xmath5with @xmath6 the normalized harmonic - trap s strength ; @xmath7 in a quasi-1d situation in becs . the nonlinear term with coefficient @xmath8 accounts for the long - range interatomic interactions , @xmath9 corresponding to the repulsion and attraction , respectively . note that the contact interaction is not taken into regard in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , as we aim to focus on the effect produced by the long - range nonlinearity ( in the gas of @xmath0cr atoms , the contact interaction may be readily suppressed by means of the feshbach resonance @xcite ) . in this work ,",
    "we consider mainly symmetric spatial kernels in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , that are positive definite , with the following three natural forms chosen for detailed analysis : the gaussian , @xmath10 the exponential , @xmath11and the _ cut - off ( co ) _ ( alias generalized lorentzian ) kernel , @xmath12the width of the kernels , @xmath13 , determines the degree of the nonlocality .",
    "all three kinds of the kernels go over into the @xmath14-function as @xmath13 approaches zero , in which case eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) turns into the usual local nls / gp equation .",
    "all the kernels are normalized as the @xmath15-function , i.e. , @xmath16 , and the norm of the wave function will be used in the usual form , @xmath17 . in what follows below ,",
    "we adopt typical physically relevant values of the scaled parameters , namely , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , in which case the two lowest eigenvalues of linear operator @xmath21 with potential ( [ eq3 ] ) are numerically found to be @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the spectrum of the underlying linear schrdinger equation ( @xmath24 ) consists of the ground state , with wave function @xmath25 , and excited states , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) . in the weakly nonlinear regime ,",
    "the galerkin - type two - mode approximation is employed to decompose the wave function @xmath1 over the minimum basis constituted by the ground state @xmath28 and the first excited state @xmath29 , associated to the eigenvalues @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively . for this purpose ,",
    "it is more convenient to use a transformed orthonormal basis composed by wave functions centered at the left and right wells , _ viz_. , @xmath32 @xmath33 . without the loss of generality , @xmath34 are both chosen to be positive definite .",
    "thus , the two - mode approximation for the wave function is defined as @xmath35where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are complex time - dependent amplitudes . substituting this into eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath38\\int \\!k(x - x^{\\prime } ) \\varphi _ { l}(x^{\\prime } ) \\varphi _ { r}(x^{\\prime } ) dx^{\\prime } , \\end{split } \\label{eq8}\\]]where the asterisk and overdot stand for the complex conjugate and time derivative , while @xmath39 and @xmath40 are linear combinations of the two lowest eigenvalues .",
    "next , we project eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) onto the single - well states @xmath41 , which involves the following overlap integrals : @xmath42the equations hold if subscripts @xmath43 and @xmath44 are swapped , or the variable @xmath45 and @xmath46 are interchanged , due to the symmetry of kernel @xmath47 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the values of the four integrals , @xmath48 , as functions of parameter @xmath13 , for the three types of kernels defined in eqs .",

    "we note that @xmath49 and @xmath50 remain negligible for any value of @xmath13 , and @xmath51 are both positive when the kernel @xmath47 is positive definite .",
    "naturally , when @xmath13 is small , which corresponds to the limit of a nearly local nonlinearity , @xmath52 is much larger that the other three overlap integrals , due to the weak overlapping of the single - well states @xmath34 .  as @xmath13 increases , @xmath52 decreases while @xmath53 increases and , finally , they tend to become equal .",
    "regarding the values of these integrals , the upcoming analysis is conducted in two situations : @xmath54 much larger than all others , and @xmath52 being on the same order of magnitude as @xmath53 . some value of the @xmath55 is to be fixed as a boundary between the two cases . since @xmath52 is always large , the key point is to set up a rule for comparing @xmath53 with @xmath56 . to this end , we define @xmath57 and the criterion is stated as follows : if @xmath58 , @xmath53 is taken into regard in the analysis of the two - mode approximation ; otherwise , @xmath53 is insignificant , and only @xmath52 is kept . for the kernels considered in this context , the criterion yields @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the gaussian , exponential and lorentzian kernels , respectively .    , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 as functions of width @xmath65 of the kernels of the following types : gaussian ( left ) , exponential ( middle ) , and lorentzian ( right ) , as defined in eqs .",

    "the asymmetric branch still emerges from the symmetric one through a subcritical pitchfork , and later becomes stable past the fold point due to the change of slope , in accordance with the vk criterion .",

    "the pitchfork bifurcation occurring on the symmetric branch switches from subcritical to supercritical , leading to the emergence of a stable asymmetric branch , as shown in the last panel of fig .",
    "this shape of the bifurcation diagram , consisting of the three branches , persists as far as @xmath201 decreases to @xmath236 .",
    "note that during this process , the turning points of the symmetric and antisymmetric branches keep getting lower ( with respect to @xmath135 ) , finally leading to a situation where the turning points do not exist , and the two branches immediately go left starting from their linear limits , i.e. , the symmetric and the antisymmetric solutions only exist for @xmath237 when @xmath238 , respectively .",
    "in this work , we have presented a systematic study of the interplay between the long - range nonlinear interactions ( of either sign , repulsive or attractive ) and linear double - well potential ( dwp ) in the 1d setting .",
    "the two - mode approximation has been developed , that accounts for the nonlocality but retains the structure similar to that established before in the case of the contact interaction .",
    "this conclusion demonstrates that the fundamental phenomenology of the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) in the dwp persists in the presence of the longer - range interactions , although the critical properties themselves ( e.g. , the critical values of the chemical potential and norm ) , at which the ssb bifurcation occurs , giving rise to the asymmetric steady states , are sensitive to the precise interaction range . in particular , our analysis has revealed a monotonous increase of the critical values as a function of the interaction range , in the case of the self - repulsion .",
    "a considerably more elaborate phenomenology was revealed by the analysis in the context of competing long- and short - range interactions . in that case , a delicate interplay between the strengths of the nonlocal repulsion and local attraction gives rise , in addition to predominantly attractive and predominantly repulsive regimes , to mixed ones with complex bifurcation phenomena .",
    "on the one hand , symmetry - breaking effects were shown to arise from each of the relevant solution branches ; in some cases , they are accompanied by reverse bifurcations , to form closed loops . on the other hand , some of the previously studied supercritical bifurcations , such as the one occurring on the symmetric branch , could become subcritical , being subsequently coupled to additional fold bifurcations .",
    "all of these effects are absent , to our knowledge , in models with a single cubic nonlinear term , being consequences of the competition .",
    "these results may be a motivation for studies in a number of future directions .",
    "in particular , it would be relevant to consider the generalizations of the dwp setting to higher dimensions , such as , the four - well configuration , which was recently demonstrated to yield a much richer phenomenology in the case of the contact interactions @xcite . in the same connection",
    ", it is relevant to note that the few - mode approach , used in this work for the consideration of the existence and stability of the symmetric , antisymmetric , and asymmetric states , as functions of the interaction strength , may be applied to other structures , such as multi - dimensional bright @xcite , dark @xcite and vortex krolik solitons , especially in cases where such structures are stabilized by nonlocal nonlinearities .",
    "a natural objective of such an analysis may be to unravel effects of the interaction range on structural stability of nonlinear waveforms . such studies are presently in progress and will be reported elsewhere .",
