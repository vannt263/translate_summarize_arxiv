    "resultants provide an essential tool in constructive algebra and in equation solving , for projecting the solution of a polynomial system into a space of smaller dimension . in the univariate case , a well - known construction due to j.j .",
    "sylvester ( 1840 ) consists in eliminating the monomials @xmath0 in the multiples @xmath1 of two given polynomials @xmath2 of degree @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and in taking the determinant of the corresponding @xmath5 matrix . though the first resultant construction appeared probably in the work of e. bzout @xcite",
    "( see also euler s work ) , and although contemporary to related works ( jacobi 1835 , richelot 1840 , cauchy 1840 ,  ) , this method remains well - known as sylvester s resultant .",
    "it is nowadays a fundamental tool used in effective algebra to eliminate a variable between two polynomials .",
    "it is a natural belief that equipped with such a tool which eliminates one variable at a time , one can iteratively eliminate several variables .",
    "this approach was actually exploited , for instance in @xcite , to deduce theoretical results ( such as the existence of eliminant polynomials ) in several variables . however",
    ", if we are interested in structural results as well as practical computations or complexity issues , this approach is far from being optimal .",
    "this explains the study and development of different types of multivariate resultants , including projective @xcite , anisotropic @xcite , toric @xcite , residual @xcite , determinantal @xcite resultants .    nevertheless , in some algorithms , such as in cylindrical algebraic decomposition ( cad ) , an induction is applied on the dimension of the problems and iterated univariate resultants and subresultants are used at many steps of the algorithm @xcite . in its original paper on quantifier elimination for real closed fields by cylindrical algebraic decomposition @xcite , collins used these iterated resultants in a geometric context and observed certain intriguing factorizations that `` suggest some theorems '' @xcite . the same year , 1975",
    ", van der waerden responded to these observations in a handwritten letter where he gave some intuitive hints for some of the phenomena noticed by collins .",
    "more recently , mccallum @xcite proved rigorously that certain iterated resultants have some irreducible factors , but he only showed the existence and did not give a way to compute them independently .",
    "as pointed out by jean - pierre jouanolou , in 1868 and 1869 olaus henrici published two outstanding papers @xcite addressing the decomposition of the discriminant of a discriminant . in particular , he gave the expected factorization of such a repeated discriminant .",
    "however , he did not prove the irreducibility of these factors which is a more difficult task .",
    "one of our goals in this paper is to give the decomposition into irreducible factors of these iterated resultant computations .    from a geometric point of view , we are interested in the solutions of equations depending on some parameters and by analyzing what happens `` above '' , when we move these parameters",
    ". the number of solutions might change if we cross the set of points where a vertical line is tangent to the solution set ( that is to the polar variety in the vertical direction ) . this polar variety projected in one dimension less ,",
    "might have singularities where the number of solutions changes effectively or which are only due to the superposition of distinct points of this polar variety .",
    "these critical points of the polar variety of an algebraic surface @xmath6 in @xmath7 are used effectively in algorithms for computing the topology of the surface ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the projection of the polar curve ( say on the @xmath8-plane ) is obtained by a discriminant computation and the critical points of this projected curve are again computed by a discriminant .",
    "these values are then used to analyze where the topology of a plane section is changing in order to deduce the topology of the whole surface @xmath6 .",
    "similar projection tools are also implicitly used in higher dimension for the triangulation of hypersurfaces ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which leads in the algebraic context to univariate resultant computation ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another of our objectives is to show how these critical points corresponding generically to folds , double folds or pleats of the surface can be related to explicit factors in iterated resultant constructions .",
    "the main results of this paper are complete explicit factorizations of two times iterated univariate resultants and discriminants of generic polynomials of given degree .",
    "we actually give the decomposition of these iterated resultants over the integer universal ring of coefficients of polynomials of given degree .",
    "such a formulation has the advantage to allow the pre - computation of a given factor .",
    "it has direct applications to the topological computation of algebraic surfaces , which was our starting point .",
    "our approach is based on the study of these iterated resultants in generic situations .",
    "most of the interesting formulas are obtained by suitable specialization of this case .",
    "these specializations are performed using the formalism of the multivariate resultant as it has been originaly introduced and deeply developed by jouanolou to whom this paper is dedicated in recognation of its outstanding contributions to resultant theory ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noticed that this approach can be pushed further to study more particular situations ( corresponding to other type of multivariate resultants ) that we did not consider in this paper , but which could be interesting for specific applications .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the next section",
    ", we recall the definitions and main properties of resultants and discriminants that we will use . in section 3",
    ", we consider the computation of iterated resultants of @xmath9 and then @xmath10 polynomials . in section 4",
    ", we analyze the iterated computation of resultants of discriminants , first the resultant of the discriminants of two distinct polynomials @xmath11 , @xmath12 and next the resultant of the discriminant of @xmath11 and the resultant of @xmath13 .",
    "we here extend the previous work @xcite and prove some properties conjectured by collins and mccallum . in section 5",
    ", we study the discriminant of a resultant , simplifying the proof and also extending some results of @xcite .",
    "these developments are used in cascade to provide , in section 6 , the complete factorization into irreducible components of a discriminant of a discriminant for a generic polynomial , as conjectured in @xcite .",
    "these new results have direct corollaries for polynomials whose coefficients are themselves generic polynomials in other parameter variables , which we provide .",
    "in this section we give the notation and quickly present the tools , as resultants and discriminants , that we will use all along this paper .",
    "let @xmath14 be a commutative ring ( with unity ) and consider the two polynomials in @xmath15 $ ] @xmath16 where @xmath17 , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are both positive integers .",
    "their resultant ( in degrees @xmath18 ) can be avoided if one considers homogeneous polynomials . ] that we will denote @xmath19 , is defined as the determinant of the well - known sylvester matrix @xmath20    [ resnot ] we emphasize that the notation @xmath19 denotes the resultant of @xmath21 and @xmath22 with respect to the variable @xmath23 as polynomials of their _ expected _ degree , which is here @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "it is important to keep this in mind since the closed formulas we will prove in this paper are using this convention ; see remark [ resmn ] for an illustration .",
    "this `` eliminant polynomial '' has a long history and many known properties .",
    "one can learn about it in many places in the literature , for instance @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite for a detailed exposition . in the sequel we will especially use the following properties :    * @xmath19 belongs to the ideal @xmath24,$ ] *",

    "it is defined as the determinant of the above sylvester matrix where the two last lines and columns number @xmath4 and @xmath32 are erased ; more precisely @xmath33 ( it is a square matrix of size @xmath34 ) .",
    "note that the subresultants share a lot of properties with the resultants ; we refer the interested reader to @xcite .      all along this paper",
    "we will also use resultants of several homogeneous polynomials ; we now quickly recall this notion . although they are usually defined `` geometrically '' ( as equations of certain hypersurfaces obtained by projection of an incidence variety ) , we will follow the formalism developed by jouanolou @xcite because it easily provides many properties of resultants .",
    "suppose given an integer @xmath35 , and a sequence of positive integers @xmath36 .",
