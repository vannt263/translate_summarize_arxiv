    "we , two non - experts , present several \" calculations and some simple measurements related to global warming and the carbon cycle .",
    "our purpose is to understand which phenomena are important in determining the temperature of the earth .",
    "in this article we will use the following measured data.@xcite the power of the radiation of the sun per square perpendicular meter above the atmosphere is measured to be @xmath1w / m@xmath2 .",
    "is @xmath3 , with @xmath4wm@xmath5k@xmath6 .",
    "the power radiated by the sun is @xmath7 .",
    "the power per unit perpendicular area received by earth ( outside of the atmosphere ) is @xmath8w / m@xmath9 . from these equations",
    "we obtain the effective temperature of sun light : @xmath10k . ]",
    "this is the `` .",
    "since the surface of the earth is 4 times the surface of a disk of the same radius , the average incident solar power per square meter of the earth s surface is @xmath11w / m@xmath2 .",
    "all fractions listed below refer to @xmath12w / m@xmath2 .",
    "the fraction of sun light that is reflected by the earth is measured to be 0.31 ( 0.21 by clouds , 0.06 by air including dust and water vapor , and 0.04 by the ground ) .",
    "this is the '' of the earth .",
    "the remaining fraction ( 0.69 ) is absorbed by the earth ( @xmath13w / m@xmath2 by the surface , @xmath14w / m@xmath2 by the troposphere ( water vapor and aerosols ) , @xmath15w / m@xmath2 by the stratosphere , and @xmath15w / m@xmath2 by clouds ) .",
    "so , the net solar power absorbed by the earth is @xmath16w / m@xmath2 for average cloud coverage .",
    "the infrared radiation of the earth to space measured by satellites is @xmath17w / m@xmath2 for average cloud coverage ( @xmath18w / m@xmath2 by clouds , @xmath19w / m@xmath2 by water vapor and @xmath0 , and @xmath20w / m@xmath2 by the surface through the infrared atmospheric window ) .",
    "so , the incoming and outgoing energies balance to high accuracy and determine the temperature of the biosphere .",
    "the average temperature of the surface of the earth is 288k@xmath21c .",
    "the average temperature of the atmosphere is about 250k@xmath22c .    in cloud free conditions",
    "the average solar power absorbed is @xmath23w / m@xmath2 , while the average emitted terrestrial radiation is @xmath24w / m@xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding numbers for average cloud cover are @xmath25w / m@xmath2 and @xmath17w / m@xmath2 as mentioned before .",
    "note that decreasing the cloud cover has a net heating effect .",
    "the earth radiation spectrum measured from a satellite ( figure [ earthradiation ] ) shows that the infrared windows ( @xmath26 to @xmath27 m and 10 to @xmath28 m ) radiate as a blackbody at the surface temperature , the @xmath0 absorption band ( @xmath29 to @xmath30 m ) radiates at 215k ( corresponding to the altitude of the tropopause at 12 km ) , and the @xmath31 bands ( @xmath32 m and @xmath33 m ) radiate at @xmath34k ( corresponding to an altitude of 5 km ) .",
    "let us begin with a simple model . from observations we know that , to high accuracy",
    ", there is an equilibrium between incident solar power and radiated infrared power .",
    "therefore @xmath35 where @xmath1w / m@xmath2 is the solar constant , @xmath36 is the fraction of incident sun light power that is absorbed by the earth , _ i.e. _ it is the \" , @xmath37 is the emissivity in the infrared , @xmath38wm@xmath5k@xmath6 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and @xmath39 is the temperature of the surface of the earth in degrees kelvin .",
    "the factor @xmath40 was explained in section 2 .",
    "we note that if @xmath41 the equilibrium temperature is 279k , quite close to the observed mean temperature of 288k .    from the data presented in section 2",
    "we conclude that @xmath42 for the earth as a whole , @xmath43 for areas covered by clouds ( it varies from 0.6 for cirrus to 0.1 for cumulonimbus ) , @xmath44 for cloudless ground , and @xmath45 for snow . because snow is mostly at high latitude",
    "we sometimes replace @xmath46 for snow .    from the data presented in section 2 we estimate that @xmath47 for the earth as a whole , @xmath48 for areas covered by clouds , @xmath49 for cloudless ground , and @xmath50 for snow .    these \" emissivities are valid for the model of this section , _",
    "i.e. _ an earth surface characterized by a single temperature , and includes the atmosphere with its greenhouse gases .",
    "the model is too crude to account for all observations , so these effective emissivities are approximate .",
    "a summary of effective emissivities is presented in table [ emissivities ] . in the last column of the table",
    "we show the equilibrium temperature for 100% coverage of black body , cloudless ground , clouds or snow .",
    "the last row shows the world average .",
    ".effective emissivities for infrared and visible radiation .",
    "the last column shows the temperature corresponding to a 100% cover of black body , cloudless ground , cloud or snow .",

    "the chemistry of carbon in the oceans is beautifully described in @xcite .",
    "we are interested in these two equations of chemical equilibrium : @xmath51 = k_h p_{co_2 } , \\label{henry}\\ ] ] which describes the solution of @xmath0 in sea water , and @xmath52 [ hco_3 ^ - ] = k_{a1 } [ co_2 ] \\label{bicarbonate}\\ ] ] that describes the ionization of hydrated carbon dioxide .",
    "@xmath53 is the partial pressure of @xmath0 in the atmosphere ( in atmospheres ) , and @xmath54 $ ] are concentrations in sea water ( in mol per liter ) .",
    "the equilibrium constants have these values at @xmath55c ( @xmath56c ) : @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) , and @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) for 0.7 ionic strength.@xcite the calculations shown in table [ oceanc ] assume @xmath61atm ( _ _ i.e.__300ppm ) .",
    "assuming that the total carbon in the air and the top 1000 m of the oceans is constant , and that 300ppm corresponds to @xmath62c and ph = 7.4 ( 8.3 ) , we obtain that a @xmath62c increase in the sea water temperature produces an increase of @xmath0 in the atmosphere of 40ppm ( 48ppm ) . in comparison , from antarctic and greenland ice cores",
    ", it is found that @xmath63c changes in temperature have been accompanied by @xmath64ppm change in @xmath53 .    in conclusion",
    ", we qualitatively understand the coupling of the pre - historic temperature with the atmospheric concentration of @xmath0 : an increase of ocean temperature reduces its solubility to @xmath0 , * causing * an increase of the atmospheric concentration of @xmath0 .",
    "the converse is not true : an increase of @xmath65ppm @xmath0 would increase the temperature , due to the greenhouse effect , by only @xmath66c .",
    "let us now estimate the effect of acid rain due to a large volcanic explosion .",
    "assume that @xmath67 kg are ejected .",
    "assume that 0.1% of this is sulfur ( in any chemical form ) that ends up as sulphuric acid in the oceans .",
    "the concentration of @xmath68 in the top 1000 m of the oceans would be @xmath69mmol / liter .",
    "we measured the ph of ocean water off the coast of ecuador as a function of @xmath68 concentration : 7.3 , 7.0 , 6.3 , and 5.5 for 0 , 0.0084 , 0.0211 and 0.0422mmol / liter respectively .",
    "so the change of ph is negligible ( @xmath70 ) , and the corresponding release of @xmath0 by the oceans is also negligible .",
    "it is observed that the concentration of @xmath0 has increased linearly from 325ppm in 1970 to 375ppm in 2004.@xcite if this increase continues at constant rate it will take about @xmath71 years to reach twice the pre - industrial concentration of 290ppm .",
    "it is observed that the buildup of atmospheric @xmath53 accurately follows the human emissions of @xmath0 ( due to burning of fossil fuels and the clearing of land for agricultural and urban use).@xcite the factor of proportionality is observed to be 65% .",
    "the remaining 35% of emitted carbon apparently ends up in the surface ( mixed ) layer of the oceans and in bio - mass .",
    "no saturation is observed so far , so the time constant with which carbon reaches the deep oceans is in excess of 50 years ( it is estimated that there are several time constants , some as long as 2000 years).@xcite    there are enough world reserves of fossil fuels ( gas , oil and coal ) to last @xmath72 years at the present rate of consumption ( 6.5gt c per year ) . burning these reserves",
    "would increase @xmath0 to three times the pre - industrial concentration assuming 65% of the emitted @xmath0 ends up in the atmosphere .",
    "however , on these longer time scales it is estimated that 30% ( instead of 65% ) of the emitted @xmath0 will remain in the atmosphere.@xcite thus we estimate that burning all of the remaining reserves of fossil fuels in the next 150 years or so , will result in twice the pre - industrial @xmath0 concentration .",
    "the solubility of @xmath0 in the oceans decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "consider a drop in the temperature of the oceans .",
    "with what time constant does the atmospheric concentration of @xmath0 drop due to the increased absorption by the oceans ?",
    "here we assume that every @xmath0 molecule colliding with the ocean surface \" to the surface .",
    "the number of @xmath0 molecules colliding with a square meter of ocean surface per second is@xcite @xmath73 the number of @xmath0 molecules in the atmosphere per square meter is @xmath74m@xmath5 .",
    "so the time constant for absorption of @xmath0 by very cold oceans is @xmath75s ( we have taken account that 0.7 of the surface of the earth is covered by oceans ) .",
    "so equilibrium of @xmath0 and the oceans is very short if we neglect diffusion of @xmath0 through the atmosphere .",
    "let us now consider diffusion .",
    "the partial pressure of @xmath0 decreases with altitude exponentially with a characteristic height @xmath76 m .",
    "how long does it take a molecule of @xmath0 to diffuse 5550 m through the atmosphere ?",
    "the result is @xmath77 years .",
    "this result assumes no convection .",
    "convection will reduce this time considerably .",
    "in fact , the flux of carbon from the atmosphere to the oceans and _ vice versa _ is enough to replace all the atmospheric carbon in 6 years.@xcite so , on time scales of interest , the partial pressure of @xmath0 in the atmosphere is proportional to the concentration of @xmath0 in the surface water of the oceans : they are in equilibrium .",
    "in the process of photosynthesis , a plant takes @xmath0 from the air , breaks it up using solar energy , and releases @xmath78 back to the atmosphere .",
    "the carbon attaches to water to form carbohydrates @xmath79 , which is what plants are made of .",
    "so , for every molecule of oxygen released to the atmosphere , there remains one atom of carbon in the plant .",
    "what happens to the carbon when the plant dies ?",
    "there are three alternatives : the carbon can ( i ) return to the atmosphere , ( ii ) accumulate on the ground , or ( iii ) end up in the oceans",
    ".    the photosynthesis process can occur in both directions .",
    "examples of photosynthesis in reverse direction are combustion when we burn wood , respiration , and decomposition by aerobic bacteria . in these processes",
    "the carbon of the plant becomes attached to oxygen from the air , and is returned to the atmosphere as @xmath0 .",
    "note that no net oxygen is produced : the oxygen released to the atmosphere during the plant growth is consumed during the plant aerobic decay .",
    "the carbon can end up in the soil , either as partially decomposed organic matter ( humus ) , as hydrocarbons or as coal .",
    "if the plant dies in a medium that lacks oxygen , such as in oceans , lakes , rivers , swamps or under volcanic ash , the anaerobic bacteria have a chance to decompose the plant ( without the competition from aerobic bacteria ) .",
    "the anaerobic bacteria produce methane ( \") , carbonic acids , bicarbonates , and humic acids .",
    "the methane can escape to the atmosphere , or under enough pressure and temperature , can polymerize into hydrocarbons or can be crushed into coal .",
    "the carbon can be washed down the rivers , in the form of carbonic acids , bicarbonates , and humic acids which are soluble in water .",
    "the rivers in the amazon basin are dark due to the humic acids .",
    "the amazon rain forest has humus only in the first few centimeters of soil .",
    "so we neglect alternative ( ii ) . to quantify alternative ( iii ) , we took samples of water of several tributaries of the amazon river ( napo alto , napo bajo , san francisco and tiputini ) and measured the concentration of bicarbonate ( 0.71 mol / m@xmath80 ) and carbonic acid ( 0.11 mol / m@xmath80 ) . assuming that these concentrations are typical of the amazon river , and multiplying by the yearly discharge of the river",
    ", we obtain the carbon discharged to the atlantic ocean by the amazon river : 50 million ( metric ) tonnes per year . in total , the amazon basin fixes about 10 billion brute tonnes of carbon per year .",
    "so , about 99.5% of this carbon returns to the atmosphere due to the aerobic decomposition of organic matter , while only about 0.5% is washed down the rivers into the atlantic ocean .",
    "it is interesting to compare these numbers with the world energy - related release of carbon dioxide from the consumption of oil , gas and coal : 24 billion tonnes in 2004 .",
    "this corresponds to 6.5 billion tonnes of carbon per year .",
    "so the amazon basin can transfer , from the atmosphere to the oceans , one year s worth of carbon dioxide emission in 130 years !",
    "with some degree of confidence , we arrive at the following conclusions .    1 .   ever since we have accurate measurements of the temperature of the atmosphere , _",
    "i.e. _ since 1702 , we observe a global increase of temperature of about 0.4@xmath81c per century .",
    "this warming does not accelerate in the second half of the xx century .",
    "in fact , we see no statistically significant global warming since 1940.@xcite we observe no correlation of the global temperature with the consumption of oil , coal and gas , or with population .",
    "the atmospheric concentrations of @xmath0 begins to increase around 1940@xcite when oil consumption takes off , yet we observe no corresponding increase of the slope of global warming.@xcite some studies suggest that this is due to a balance between the heating effect of @xmath0 and the cooling effects of aerosols and deforestation.@xcite from the data it is concluded that the accumulated effect of humankind on the global temperature until 1990 is not statistically significant : @xmath82c.@xcite so , the observed global warming since 1702 is part of the natural variability of the climate as we pull out of the \" three centuries ago .",
    "the pre - industrial concentration of @xmath0 in the atmosphere was @xmath83 ppm in 1800 .",
    "it has since increased to 375 ppm in 2004.@xcite there is convincing evidence that this increase is due to burning of fossil fuels ( and forrests , and the manufacture of cement ) .",
    "detailed models estimate that the changes of atmospheric composition since pre - industrial times up to 1995 produce a change of temperature of @xmath84k due to all greenhouse gases ( about half of this is from @xmath0 ) , @xmath85k due to aerosols@xcite , and @xmath86k due to the change of albedo caused by deforestation@xcite .",
    "so we do not know if human activity heats or cools the earth . as indicated above , no significant net change has been observed .",
    "the increase of the concentration of @xmath0 in the atmosphere accurately tracks the burning of fossil fuels ( and forrests ) .",
    "two thirds of the carbon burned ends up in the atmosphere as @xmath0 , and the remaining third ends up dissolved in the surface layer of the oceans ( the time constant for this dissolution is about 6 years ) .",
    "the fraction of excess carbon in the atmosphere should decrease to one third in about 50 years as more carbon is incorporated into the oceans ( as @xmath0 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) , and in the land and marine biota .",
    "the last third of the excess @xmath0 in the atmosphere is expected to return to the deep oceans and become buried as elemental carbon and as carbonates with several time constants ranging from hundreds to thousands of years.@xcite 5 .",
    "burning all of the remaining economically viable reserves of oil , gas and coal over the next 150 years or so will approximately double the pre - industrial atmospheric concentration of @xmath0 .",
    "the global warming due to a doubling of the concentration of @xmath0 is expected to increase the average surface air temperature by 1.3k to 4.8k.@xcite the increase of temperature is expected to be higher than average at higher latitudes ( and lower than average at low latitudes ) .",
    "the heating effect of @xmath0 is obvious when we look at the earth emission spectra shown in figure [ earthradiation ] .",
    "the range of results is large , so global warming is a difficult problem that does not seem to converge : as the models become more complex , the uncertainties appear to increase ! 6 .",
    "ice core samples indicate that @xmath0 concentration and temperature are well correlated : a change of temperature by 9.5@xmath81c corresponds to a change in @xmath0 concentration from 195ppm to 270ppm.@xcite does the change of @xmath0 concentration cause the change of temperature ( by the greenhouse effect ) , or does the change of temperature cause the change of @xmath0 concentration ( due to the temperature dependence of the solubility of carbon in the oceans ) ?",
    "due to the greenhouse effect , an increase of @xmath0 concentration from 195ppm to 270ppm would cause an increase in temperature of @xmath66c , much too small to account for the observed change in temperature .",
    "conversely , an increase of @xmath63c of the temperature of the upper 1000 m of the oceans would increase the atmospheric concentration of @xmath0 by @xmath90ppm ( depending on the ocean ph ) .",
    "so it is plausible that the changes of temperature of the oceans * caused * the pre - historic changes of atmospheric @xmath0 concentration .",
    "data suggests that large volcanic explosions can trigger transitions from glacial to interglacial climates , by covering ice with volcanic ash , thereby changing the equilibrium temperature of the earth as seen in table [ emissivities ] .",
    "photosynthesis in the amazon basin fixes @xmath91 billion tonnes of carbon per year .",
    "however , aerobic decay releases almost all of this carbon back to the atmosphere as @xmath0 .",
    "the balance , @xmath92 million tonnes of carbon per year , is discharged to the atlantic ocean in the form of carbonic acids , bicarbonates , and humic acids ."
