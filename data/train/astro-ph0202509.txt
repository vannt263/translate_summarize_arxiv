    "it is commonly accepted that pne are formed by the current fast stellar wind sweeping up the former slow asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) wind . in this interacting - stellar - winds scenario ( kwok , purton , & fitzgerald 1978 ) , the physical structure of a pn is similar to that of an interstellar wind - blown bubble as modeled by weaver et al .",
    "the interior of a pn is filled with shocked fast wind reaching temperatures of @xmath0 k , and this hot gas is confined within a 10@xmath1 k nebular shell consisting of swept - up agb wind .",
    "the shocked fast wind per se has too low a density to emit appreciably in x - rays . at the interface between the hot interior and the cool nebular shell ,",
    "heat conduction lowers the temperature and mass evaporation raises the density of the hot interior gas , producing optimal conditions for x - ray emission .",
    "therefore , soft x - ray emission is expected from the 10@xmath2 k gas near the interface .",
    "the physical processes taking place at the interface have been mostly a theoretical topic .",
    "the interface physics is expected to be complicated by the presence of magnetic field and turbulences . to thoroughly understand the interface physics , observations of the transition region are needed . while the 10@xmath2 k gas can be observed in x - rays , the adjacent layer of 10@xmath3 k gas can be observed only in the uv and far - uv through spectral lines of collisionally ionized c , n , and o at high ionization stages .",
    "x - ray observations of the hot gas in pn interiors can be confused by the x - ray emission from the central star of a pn ( cspn ) .",
    "a hot cspn with a low opacity in its atmosphere can be a soft x - ray emitter , while a cspn with a late - type companion may show a coronal x - ray source .",
    "the photospheric emission from a hot cspn peaks below 0.1 kev and can be spectroscopically discerned from thin plasma emission . on the other hand ,",
    "the coronal emission from a late - type companion may show similar spectral shapes to plasma emission ; thus , emission from the hot gas in pn interiors can be unambiguously confirmed _ only _ if it is spatially resolved .",
    "the quest for diffuse x - ray emission from hot gas in pn interiors is long and difficult , but significant progress has been made as the sensitivity and resolution of x - ray detectors have improved .      since 1978",
    ", several x - ray satellites have been launched with imaging instruments sensitive to soft x - rays in the energy range 0.12 kev , where x - ray emission from pne is expected .",
    "table 1 summarizes the x - ray observing facilities available in the past 25 years .",
    "the earlier imaging detectors with spectral capabilities are mostly proportional counters with inherently low angular resolution ( @xmath4 ) and spectral resolution ( e.g. , @xmath5 2.2 at 1 kev for _ rosat _ pspc ) .",
    "this situation is vastly improved by the advent of solid - state and ccd detectors , e.g. , _ chandra _ acis has an angular resolution of 1@xmath6 and a spectral resolution of @xmath710 at 1 kev . the currently available _ chandra _ acis and _ xmm - newton _ epic , with their unprecedented spatial and spectral resolutions and",

    "archival data of pne , tarafdar & apparao ( 1988 ) reported x - ray emission from ngc246 , ngc6853 , ngc7293 , and a33 .",
    "similarly , apparao & tarafdar ( 1989 ) used the @xmath8 archive and reported x - ray emission from ngc1535 , ngc3587 , ngc4361 , and a36 . the reported emission from a33 and ngc1535",
    "was later shown by _",
    "observation to arise from background x - ray sources ( conway & chu 1987 ; chu , gruendl , & conway 1998 ) .",
    "the search for diffuse x - ray emission from hot gas in pn interiors was not attempted until _ rosat _ became available . during the first six months of the _ rosat _ mission ,",
    "a pspc detector was used to scan the whole sky . using this _ rosat _ all - sky survey , kreysing et al .",
    "( 1992 ) reported diffuse x - ray emission from a number of pne .",
    "unfortunately , their work was plagued by low s / n ratios in the data , electronic ghost image of the pspc detectors at energies below 0.2 kev , and mis - identification of nearby or companion coronal sources .",
    "after careful scrutiny , the only object in their sample to show x - ray emission marginally more extended than the point spread function of the pspc was ngc6543 .    during the _ rosat _ mission ,",
    "pointed observations of a large number of pne were made , but only the few positive detections were reported , for example , ngc246 , ngc1360 ( hoare et al .",
    "1995 ) , ngc3587 ( chu , gruendl , & conway 1998 ) , and ngc7293 ( leahy , zhang , & kwok 1994 ) . when the _ rosat _ mission concluded in 1998 , the _ rosat _ archive had acquired pointed or serendipitous observations with @xmath92 ks exposures for @xmath1080 pne .",
    "these observations were analyzed , and x - ray emission from 13 pne was detected ( guerrero , chu , & gruendl 2000 ) . of these 13 pne , only three had been reported to show extended emission that could be associated with hot gas : ngc6543 ( kreysing et al .",
    "1992 ) , a30 ( chu & ho 1995 ; chu , chang , & conway 1997 ) , and bd+30@xmath113639 ( leahy , kwok , & yin 2000 ) . in all three cases the x - ray emission was only marginally more extended than the point spread function of the detector used .    an indirect indication of diffuse x - ray emission from hot gas in pne is provided by the _ rosat _ pspc spectra .",
    "the pne detected by @xmath12 show three types of spectra ( conway & chu 1997 ; guerrero , chu , & gruendl 2000 ) .",
    "type 1 spectra , peaking near 0.10.2 kev and diminishing above 0.5 kev , are consistent with photospheric emission from hot cspns .",
    "type 2 spectra , peaking at @xmath90.5 kev , are characteristic for plasma emission .",
    "type 3 spectra , possessing a bright peak near 0.10.2 kev and a weak peak at @xmath101 kev , are apparently composites of the first two types",
    ". objects with type 2 spectra are good candidates for diffuse x - ray emission ; these include bd+30@xmath113639 and ngc6543 , and possibly ngc7009 .",
    "_ asca _ observations of bd+30@xmath113639 have provided high - resolution spectra and confirmed the nature of plasma emission ( arnaud , borkowski , & harrington 1996 ) .",
    "finally , the superb angular resolution of the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory made it possible to unambiguously resolve the diffuse x - ray emission from pn interiors : bd+30@xmath113639 , ngc6543 , and ngc7027 ( kastner et al .  2000 , 2001 ; chu et al .  2001 ) . the unprecedented sensitivity of _ xmm - newton _ made it possible to resolve the faint diffuse x - ray emission from ngc7009 ( guerrero , gruendl , & chu 2002 ) .",
    "these observations allow us to examine the distribution and physical conditions of the hot gas in pn interiors .",
