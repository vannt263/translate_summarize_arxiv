    "the circumnuclear regions within the first kiloparsec in disk galaxies turn out to be decoupled on its dynamic characteristics .",
    "using of the technique of panoramic spectroscopy makes it possible to study in detail the differences in kinematics of the stellar and gaseous components .",
    "i briefly review following types of kinematically decoupled regions in galactic disks :    * non - circular motions caused by the dynamical effects ( spirals , bars , colliding rings ) .",
    "* circular rotation in different planes or directions ( polar rings , counter - rotating disks ) . * non - circular motions caused by a violent starformation ( bubbles , high - velocity clouds ) .",
    "the study of two - dimensional kinematics of galaxies at 6 m telescope of sao ras with the scanning fpi was started by our colleagues from marseille observatoire ( j.  boulesteix et al . ) in cooperation with team in sao in the first half of 1980s .",
    "the observations were made with the system cigale .",
    "then the ipcs was replaced by a ccd and in 2000 the first observations with a new multimode focal reducer scorpio @xcite were carried out .",
    "today fpi mode of scorpio provides @xmath0 field of view with a spectral resolution 1 - 2.5 in the h@xmath1 , [ nii ] , [ sii ] and [ oiii ] emission lines .",
    "so , using fpi data we create monochromatic images as well as fields of the line - of - sight velocities in these lines ( fig .  [",
    "mois : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the integral field spectrograph mpfs based on the idea by victor afanasiev et al . : the combination of a lens array with a bundle of fibers @xcite .",
    "first version of the spectrograph was developed in 1990 .",
    "current variant of the mpfs became operational at the 6 m telescope since 1998 @xcite .",
    "fibers transmit light from @xmath2 square elements of the galaxy image to the slit of the spectrograph , together with 16 additional fibers that transmit the sky background taken away from the galaxy .",
    "the angular scale is @xmath3 and the spectral resolution is @xmath4 .",
    "using mpfs for kinematics of galaxies allows us to build velocity fields of ionized gas as well as of their stellar component .",
    "the descriptions of our spectrographs are available at sao ras web page : ` http://www.sao.ru/hq/lsfvo/ `     images with the sketch of gas motions : the radial inflow along a bar and the nuclear jet outflow in sy ngc  6104 ( a ) ; the expansion of the emission ring in arp  10 ( b ) ; polar disk in ngc  7468 ( c),width=11 ]",
    "the values of non - circular motions in barred galaxies can be estimate in the detailed analysis of their velocity fields .",
    "for instance , sy galaxy ngc  6104 where the ionized gas radial inflow motions along the bar co - exist with nuclear outflow caused by jet - clouds interactions , @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ mois : fig1]a ) .",
    "recently we have observed a sample of candidate double - barred galaxies and suggest that these objects are , in fact , galaxies with very different circumnuclear structure @xcite .",
    "the majority of the observed morphological and kinematic features in the sample may be explained without the secondary bar hypothesis .",
    "three cases of inner polar disks , one counter - rotating gaseous disk and seven nuclear disks nested in large - scale bars were found in this work .",
    "the type of the motion of gas clouds may noticeably differ from the rotation of the stellar component even in ` quiet ' galaxies without agn .",
    "the characteristic case is a lenticular galaxy ngc  3945 ( fig .",
    "[ mois : fig2]a ) .",
    "the velocity field of the stars in the circumnuclear disk shows the normal circular rotation . for the gas velocity field",
    "the situation is more complicated . in @xmath5 ( 0.5 kpc ) ,",
    "the line - of - sight velocities of ionized gas are in the maximum amplitude to those of stars but opposite in sign . on larger distances",
    "the direction of rotation of gas changes abruptly and coincides with the stellar component rotation .",
    "the large - scale fpi velocity field confirms the fact of normal gas rotation at large radii , up to 11 kpc .",
    "therefore , we have detected a circumnuclear disk of ionized gas rotating in the opposite direction with respect to the stellar component , @xcite .",
    "this is probably attributable to a merger of an accreted gaseous cloud with the corresponding direction of an angular momentum @xcite .",
    "collisional ring galaxies represent a class of objects in which nearly circular density waves are driven into a disk as a result of an almost face - on collision with another galaxy .",
    "we have observed with fpi a pecular galaxy arp  10 , which has two rings ( the inner and outer one ) , and extended outer arc .",
    "the h@xmath1 velocity field shows evidence for significant radial motions in both outer and inner galactic rings .",
    "we fit a model velocity field taking into account the regular rotation and projection effects .",
    "the expansion velocity of the nw part of the outer ring exceeds 100km / s , whereas it attain only 30km / s at the se part @xcite .",
    "therefore , the asymmetric shape of the outer ring ( fig .",
    "[ mois : fig1]b ) may be caused by a systematic difference in the ring expansion velocity and collisional origin of the rings is a proven fact .",
    "recently the team in st.petersburg university ( v. hagen - thorn , l. shaliapina , v. yakovleva ) in a collaboration with us attempt to observe with fpi a gas kinematics in candidate polar - ring galaxies .",
    "the interesting results were already obtained .",
    "for example , they detected an inner gaseous disk whose rotation plane is almost perpendicular to the plane of the ` main ' galactic disk in ngc  7648 @xcite .",
    "the fig .",
    "[ mois : fig1]c shows the sharp turn of isovelocities in the galactic circumnuclear region . the central collision of ngc  7468 with a gas - rich dwarf galaxy and their subsequent merging seem to be responsible for the formation of the disk .    in the barred galaxy ngc  5850 the direction of rotation measured from the stellar component coincides with the line of nodes of the disk whereas in the ionized gas it differs by more than @xmath6 and coincides with the position angle of the central isophotes",
    ". such a behavior is typical for a disk inclined to the galactic plane .",
    "a more reasonable assumption is that the gas , at @xmath7 kpc , rotates in a polar plane with respect to the global galactic disk @xcite . in this case",
    ", the polar gaseous disk lies orthogonal to the major axis of the bar .",
    "it is remarkable that similar polar mini - disks inside the large - scale bars or the three - axial bulge have already been detected in about twenty galaxies ( see @xcite and the contribution by olga silchenko in this volume ) .",
    "a burst of starformation also produces non - circular gas motions triggered by the combined effect of stellar winds and supernova explosions in rich stellar groupings . in dwarf galaxies",
    "the formation of giant multi - shell complexes around stellar groupings can proceed unhindered .",
    "see , for example , observations with scorpio - fpi of the nearby irregular galaxy ic1613 @xcite : the authors refined the expansion velocities of individual shells of the ionized and neutral gas ( fig .",
    "[ mois : fig3 ] ) . in such galaxies",
    "the main part of line - of - sight velocities connects with an expansion of hii regions , frequently without any rotation ( like viizw403 , see also fig .",
    "[ mois : fig3 ] , left )    i ll like to thank v. afanasiev , s. dodonov , o. silchenko and a. smirnova for their help and numerous discussions .",
    "this work was partially supported by the rfbr grant no .",

    "i also thank the russian science support foundation and the organizing committee of the workshop ."
