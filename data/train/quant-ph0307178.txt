    "quantum communication ( qc ) has recently emerged as a subject of much interest , due to its applications in distributed quantum computation and quantum cryptography @xcite . in qc ,",
    "non - orthogonal quantum signals are typically transmitted through telecom fibers .",
    "reducing noise in telecom fibers is crucial for qc applications , because the very weak signals carried by polarization states are usually employed .",
    "ideally , a single photon in a superposition of two pulses separated in time with a controlled phase difference ( i.e. , @xmath0 ) may be used . however ,",
    "on - demand single - photon sources remain an important technological challenge . currently , weak coherent states are often employed as approximate single photon signals .",
    "it is well known in quantum cryptography @xcite )  a branch of qc  that weak coherent states may open up loopholes in security because of the probabilistic existence of multi - photon signals @xcite . indeed , a weak coherent state , when phase randomized via decoherence , gives a poisson distribution in photon numbers .",
    "an eavesdropper , eve , may , in principle , measure the photon number in such a signal by a non - demolition measurement . afterward",
    ", she can stop all single photon signals from reaching the receiver , bob . for each multi - photon signal , she can steal one photon and keep it in her quantum memory and send the rest of the signals to bob by using , for example , an ideal channel instead . since eve now has an exact copy of the quantum state transmitted to bob , this creates a significant challenge in the security of quantum cryptography @xcite . thus , attenuation losses and decoherence in qc are a major issue and methods for reducing such quantum noise are therefore important . unfortunately , the classically successful amplifiers ( such as edfa @xcite ) can not be used in qc because of the no - cloning theorem @xcite , and new methods must be explored .    here",
    ", we propose a method to reduce noise in the transmission of quantum optical signals in a telecom fiber .",
    "our method is inspired by the theory of quantum dynamical bang - bang  ( bb ) decoupling @xcite .",
    "however , a key novelty of our work is the following : we propose to implement bb control in space , rather than time , through the insertion at regular intervals of a sequence of simple linear optical elements ( phase - shifters and/or beam - splitters ) in sections of a telecom fiber .",
    "we also discuss the experimental feasibility of our scheme , and propose a few simple experimental tests .",
    "we do not expect our method to improve the fidelity of classical light transmission compared to , e.g. , edfa amplifiers , since our method turns out to be quite sensitive to reflection from optical elements and deviations from average fiber homogeneity , which is not the case for classical amplifiers .",
    "an optical fiber provides boundary conditions that guide light along a ( locally ) straight trajectory .",
    "an ideal fiber allows modes of traveling photons to propagate through unchanged .",
    "a real fiber induces noise ( dispersion , loss , decoherence ) compared to the ideal case . the method we introduce in this paper",
    "is designed to cancel ( in principle ) all quantum noise .",
    "the dominant classical - light loss mechanisms in an optical fiber are uv absorption , rayleigh backscattering , oh absorption , and raman scattering , and lead to typical attenuation rates , for state - of - the - art commercial silica telecom fiber , of about 0.25db / km @xcite .",
    "these mechanisms are active also in the quantum regime @xcite .",
    "all noise processes affecting quantum light in optical fibers are derivable from a microscopic hamiltonian describing ( i ) the direct interaction between photons and the optical ( dielectric ) material of a fiber , and ( ii ) the indirect interaction between photons and quasi - particle excitations of the fiber material , such as polaritons and photon - phonon coupling .",
    "these indirect interactions are , of course , in turn derivable from a microscopic hamiltonian that takes into account matter - matter interactions in the fiber , and couples them to photons .",
    "the derivation of the resulting effective interactions ( e.g. , a non - linear schrdinger equation ) from such microscopic hamiltonians has been covered in detail , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the observation that all interactions involving photons can be written in terms of polynomials in the bosonic raising and lowering operators @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the mode of the traveling photons @xcite ) .",
    "a polynomial of order @xmath3 describes an @xmath3-photon process , and typically the cross - section of interactions decreases with increasing @xmath3 . in the case of the non - relativistic quantum electrodynamics of charged particles",
    "one can decompose the photon - matter interaction hamiltonian into linear and quadratic terms with respect to the photon field , @xmath4 , where the linear part is @xmath5where the bath  operators @xmath6 depend only on the variables of charged particles and/or quasi - particles , and the quadratic part @xmath7 is a function of the bilinear operators , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "higher - order interactions may originate from relativistic effects .",
    "in general @xmath7 , which makes no contribution to one - photon processes , is much smaller than @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the quadratic term can usually be neglected .",
    "let us substantiate these arguments by briefly reviewing the corresponding non - relativistic electrodynamics .",
    "consider particles @xmath12 with charge @xmath13 and mass @xmath14 , which constitute the optical material of a fiber .",
    "let @xmath15 and @xmath16 be the position and momentum of particle @xmath12 , and @xmath17 be the vector potential of the photon field .",
    "the system - bath hamiltonian that describes the dynamics can be written , in the coulomb gauge , as @xmath18here @xmath19 depends only on the variables of the charged particles .",
    "@xmath20 is the free photon hamiltonian , where @xmath21 are the photon annihilation and creation operators in the normal vibrational mode @xmath2 of the field identified by the wave vector @xmath22 , the polarization @xmath23 and the frequency @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "then the linear part with respect to the photon field @xcite is @xmath26where for a cubic box with dimension @xmath27 the operator @xmath6 can be expressed as @xmath28which only depends on the variables of charged particles . here",
    "@xmath29 is the @xmath30 factor , @xmath31 is the permittivity of free space , and @xmath32 is the spin of particle @xmath12 .",
    "note that the interaction is linear in the operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the quadratic part of the interaction hamiltonian is found to be @xmath35and is a function of the bilinear operators , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath10 .    under the long - wavelength approximation , where the spatial variations of the electromagnetic field over the size of the particles is negligible , first order perturbation theory of @xmath11 results in the widely applied dipole interaction ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "some effective interactions , such as atom - mediated photon - photon interactions and nonlinear photon - photon interactions ( kerr effect ) have been derived without consideration of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "we provide more details on these effective interaction in section [ leading ] . for simplicity of presentation we will first design an anti-_linear_-decoherence fiber  by considering @xmath38 only . later on we show how to treat higher order interaction terms .",
    "it is important to stress that in essence our method hardly depends on the details of the interaction , but _",
    "depends on the statistics of photons as bosons_. for this reason our method is very general and is in principle applicable to the entire phenomenology of quantum noise processes affecting photons in fibers , though its practical applicability is a matter of being able to satisfy certain constraints that will be discussed in detail below .",
    "we first consider quantum data transmission through a telecom fiber with noise induced by @xmath11 . since @xmath11 describes absorption and creation of photons , it generates photon loss , among other processes . to simplify",
    ", we suppose that a _ polarization _ photon is transmitted from end @xmath39 to end @xmath40 .",
    "one can define a logical qubit supported by @xmath41 and @xmath42 where the mode indices refer to the two polarization states .",
    "the initial state at end @xmath39 is @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the state of the bath ( dielectric material and quasi - particle excitations in the fiber ) . at the time @xmath45 ( where @xmath46 is the distance between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and @xmath47 is the average speed of light in the telecom fiber ) the wave function is @xmath48 @xmath49 , where the evolution operator is ( in units where @xmath50 ) @xmath51 , where @xmath52dx$ ] is the average hamiltonian over the @xmath53th segment , where @xmath54 is a sum of the matter ( and/or excitations ) and photon self - hamiltonians , @xmath55 , and we have assumed that @xmath56 is large in order to expand the normal - ordered exact propagator @xmath57dx]:$ ] .",
    "i.e. , we have neglected deviations from average fiber homogeneity , @xmath58)^{2}\\rangle $ ] [ @xmath59 can easily be expressed including such second and higher order moments using a magnus expansion , and it is known how to generalize bb decoupling to treat such higher moments , at the expense of more bb pulses @xcite ] .",
    "the interaction @xmath60 entangles the output wave function at end @xmath40 with the material / excitations in the fiber . by standard arguments it follows that , therefore , the quantum information encoded into the photon state will decohere @xcite .    in order to solve this problem of decoherence , we draw inspiration from the idea of bb decoupling via time - dependent pulses @xcite ( we note that a method for finding such pulses directly from empirical data was proposed in @xcite ) .",
    "we first recall the action of a phase - shifter .",
    "it is simple to show [ using the baker - campbell - hausdorff ( bch ) formula @xcite ] for a boson that @xmath61where @xmath62 is a boson number operator .",
    "physically , the operation @xmath63 is a @xmath64 phase - shifter ( it puts a phase of @xmath65 between the number states @xmath66 and @xmath67 , not to be confused with our logical qubit states ) . defining the @xmath64-phase - shifter operator @xmath68we therefore have @xmath69because the photons term of @xmath54 is @xmath70 , so that @xmath71=0 $ ] .",
    "the crucial point is that _ the sign of the linear term of the interaction hamiltonian has been negated by the action of two phase - shifters , i.e. , effectively time - reversed_. now , if we install thin phase - shifters inside the fiber at positions @xmath72 , from @xmath39 to @xmath40 , the evolution will be modified to @xmath73,\\end{aligned}\\]]where in the second line we have introduced a self - explanatory notation that will be used repeatedly below .",
    "note that in writing this expression we have neglected the variation of @xmath74 inside the phase - shifter ; this will hold provided that the phase - shifter width is much smaller than the distance over which deviations @xmath75 from average fiber homogeneity become significant .",
    "further note that we are applying the parity - kick  version of bb decoupling viola:98,vitali:99 , but are implementing it in space , rather than time .",
    "now assume that the _ average _ hamiltonians over two successive segments are equal : @xmath76the better this approximation , the better our method will perform ; we address deviations in appendix  [ app ] .",
    "in this case , to first order in @xmath77 , and using eq .",
    "( [ eq : flip ] ) , we have exact cancellation of @xmath38 between successive segments : @xmath78this yields the overall evolution operator @xmath79i.e . , the evolution is completely decoherence - free , in analogy to the ideal bb limit of infinitely fast and strong pulses @xcite .",
    "because of the in - principle equivalence between the bb method and the quantum zeno effect @xcite , the proposed method can only work if the phase - shifters are inserted at small intervals @xmath80 over which coherence loss is quadratic ( zeno - like ) , rather than exponential ( markovian ) .",
    "a reliable estimate of @xmath80 requires a first principles calculation which is beyond the scope of the present work ; we present a phenomenological model for a detailed estimate of @xmath80 in appendix  [ app ] . here",
    "we give a rough _ upper bound _ estimate of this distance .",
    "we assume that the linear term of the interaction hamiltonian gives rise to the @xmath81db / km ( @xmath82 ) _ classical _ loss figure in a telecom fiber .",
    "our main approximation now consists in further assuming that the insertion of phase - shifters into the fiber causes a reduction of loss from first to second order , and we use this to estimate the @xmath80 required in the _ quantum _ case . thus , imagine a distributed quantum computing scenario where small - scale quantum computers are connected by optical fibers of length about 1 km .",
    "our goal is to have reliable quantum computation within the fault - tolerance threshold value of @xmath83 error rate for each elementary quantum logical operation .",
    "[ we remark that for reliable quantum _ communication of entangled photon pairs _ , the current error rate of about @xmath82 is already acceptable provided one allows the application of entanglement purification @xcite ; our scheme is significantly simpler . ] therefore , we need to cut down the loss figure from @xmath84 to say @xmath83 .",
    "suppose we need to insert @xmath3 phase - shifter within 1 km of a telecom fiber .",
    "denote the attenuation between a pair of phase - shifter by @xmath85 .",
    "then , without the @xmath3 phase - shifters , we have @xmath86 . for a sufficiently large @xmath3",
    ", we can expand the expression binomially and obtain the approximation @xmath87 .",
    "now , with the insertion of phase - shifters , we simply assume that the attenuation between two phase - shifters is due to a second order contribution of the form @xmath88 .",
    "we further assume that those contributions sum up in usual addition .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath89 .",
    "this yields @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "recalling that two phase - shifters are needed per cancellation step , we see that about @xmath92 phase - shifters have to be inserted in a distance of 1 km which translates to one phase - shifter every @xmath93 m .",
    "this figure is merely a rough upper bound estimate on the distance @xmath80 between two phase - shifters for our scheme to be useful ; one can also determine @xmath80 via the experiment we propose below . also note that we have assumed here that the fiber is straight as is typically done in theoretical models . in order to regain the straight fiber approximation , in the case of a curved fiber @xmath80",
    "is upper - bounded by the local radius of curvature .",
    "while in spirit our method is similar to bb decoupling @xcite , a major advantage here is that we do not need to apply any time - dependent pulses , which may result in significant uncertainties such as gate errors and off - resonance transitions . instead",
    ", the phase - shifters may be incorporated into the fiber directly during the manufacturing process .",
    "alternatively , time - independent ( say , electronic or pressure ) controls may be applied at various points of a telecom fiber to achieve the action of pulse shifters .",
    "we now consider higher order processes .",
    "although they are generally weak , the bilinear interactions appearing in @xmath7 may still cause decoherence . a direct harmful consequence is to change the polarization direction , through a term such as @xmath94 . in the classical case , the fiber structure",
    "can be designed so that a _ _  known _ _ polarization direction can be preserved @xcite . in the quantum case",
    "the polarization direction is _ not known _ prior to the transmission and the classical method is not applicable . in this case",
    "one must in general consider a system - bath hamiltonian that is a linear combination of all @xmath95 possible independent bilinear terms : @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 ( the grouping will be clarified momentarily ) .",
    "it can be shown that all @xmath95 of these terms can be eliminated by installing @xmath99 linear optical devices that include beam - splitters in addition to phase - shifters , i.e. , in @xmath100 elementary steps ( we combine beam - splitting and phase - shifting into one step ) .",
    "this result is based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : n - b ] ) and the following identities [ that follow directly from eq .",
    "( [ eq : n - b ] ) ] @xmath101the role of the beam - splitter is to eliminate the set of operators @xmath102 ; the beam - splitter is inserted after the first eight steps .",
    "the @xmath100-step result can be considerably simplified in the realistic situation wherein the two polarizations used to represent our qubit are degenerate . in this case",
    "@xmath102 becomes @xmath103 , which generates an _ overall _ phase and hence will not cause decoherence . in this degenerate case , as we now show , we need only phase - shifters to eliminate all contributions to decoherence .",

    "we have a fiber that is completely free of both linear and bilinear decoherence - causing terms for degenerate polarization qubits .",
    "we can repeat the mixed - classical - quantum rough distance estimate above , by simply assuming that now contributions to decoherence come only due to third order in @xmath85 : @xmath118 .",
    "this leads to @xmath119 , and recalling that @xmath116 phase - shifters are needed per cancellation step , we arrive at an upper - bound estimate of about @xmath95 phase - shifters per km , or one phase - shifter every 100 m .",
    "these phase - shifters must be introduced in addition to the ones used above for cancellation of first order effects .",
    "we have again assumed here that the fiber is straight ; local curvature may impose a lower upper bound .",
    "so far we have considered linear and bilinear photon terms in the interaction hamiltonian . the most general two - mode photon - related term in a hamiltonian is @xmath120 .",
    "provided @xmath121 and @xmath122 the identity@xmath123shows that such a term can be eliminated using only phase shifters .",
    "for example , when @xmath124 is an odd number , our considerations in the linear case show that the term can be eliminated using the phase shifter @xmath125 , while @xmath126 can be eliminated using @xmath127 .",
    "high - order terms with @xmath128 arise if one considers the relativistic contribution , and they appear also in most of the effective photon scattering theories .",
    "it should be clear that if such terms arise , they can be reduced using additional phase - shifters , or beam - splitters in the case @xmath129 and/or @xmath130 , which arise due to terms containing photon number operators .",
    "as mentioned in section [ noise ] the leading loss mechanisms in optical fibers are well characterized :  uv absorption , rayleigh backscattering , oh absorption , and infrared absorption .",
    "it is useful to quickly review how these processes arise , and then are treated by our method .",
    "consider , for example , the case of rayleigh backscattering .",
    "we base our discussion on the standard reference @xcite ( for a general description of absorption see p.168 ; the cross section of raleigh scattering is given on pp .",
    "371 - 373 ) .",
    "the discussion starts @xcite[eq .",
    "( 4.9.9 ) ] from the _ dipole approximation _ to our general photon - matter interaction hamiltonian , eq .  ( [ eq : hl ] ) :    @xmath131    where @xmath132 is the interacting charged particle state , or the eigenstate of @xmath19 , @xmath133 is the atom position , @xmath134 is the volume , @xmath135 are the matrix elements of atomic dipole moment , and @xmath136 is the polarization .",
    "a general scattering transition rate @xmath137 is @xcite[eq .",

    "there are @xmath144 incident photons and a single scattered photon with frequency @xmath145 and wave vector @xmath146 .",
    "then the cross - section follows from the relation @xmath147 , and the differential light - scattering cross - section is @xmath148 .",
    "the differential cross - section of rayleigh scattering is the special case when the atom returns to its ground state , which is @xcite[eq .",
    "( 8.8.1 ) ] : @xmath149 where the parameters are obtained from matrix elements of @xmath150    the important equation is ( [ eq : tau ] ) above : it shows that rayleigh scattering originates from the interaction @xmath151 .",
    "clearly , the differential cross - section of rayleigh scattering vanishes when @xmath152 is zero . _",
    "our spatial bb  method does just that : it effectively eliminates the interaction _ @xmath151 .",
    "of course , this is not unique to rayleigh scattering , which is just one of the processes derived from considering various cases involving @xmath151 .",
    "for example , photon absorption and emission is mainly related to transitions involving two atomic or molecular levels .",
    "the corresponding matrix element for absorption is @xcite[eq .",

    "( [ eq : absor ] ) that this absorption is prevented when @xmath151 is zero .",
    "note how @xmath151 , which is effectively eliminated by our method , involves the bosonic raising and lowering operators @xmath156 .",
    "the reason that our method is so general is that it acts directly on these operators , and time - reverses  @xmath151 by flipping their sign .",
    "as mentioned above , a crucial requirement for the success of our proposed method is to insert the optical elements at intervals over which the coherence - loss is still quadratic , rather than exponential .",
    "an experiment to test for this regime is thus useful .",
    "this could be done by monitoring the coherence ( in particular , loss ) locally , by focusing onto the edge of the fiber and collecting light into a photon - counting device ( since the absolute intensity would be very small ) . by moving the focus along the fiber",
    ", one should be able to track the decay as a function of distance from the fiber entry point , and observe the required quadratic - to - exponential transition , yielding an estimate of @xmath80 .    to actually test the method in the presence of phase - shifters",
    ", one could repeat the above experiment with a single fiber and write some phase - shift segments into it ( as in the manufacturing of fiber bragg gratings ) , at intervals bounded above by those determined from the first experiment .",
    "we note that a point of some potential concern is the impedance mismatch between air and the phase - shifter material , that will lead to reflection .",
    "let @xmath157 ( @xmath158 ) denote the indices of refraction : the reflected amplitude is @xmath159 , which leads , at normal incidence , to 4% loss per air - glass interface .",
    "however , a standard anti - reflection coating can solve the problem : a quarter - wave layer of material at @xmath160 between the two materials ( two equal reflections out of phase cancel out ) . in fibers",
    "the index changes will be smaller and reflection is typically neglected .",
    "moreover , by writing a smooth phase profile as in the experiment proposed above , the reflection problem essentially disappears .",
    "once @xmath80 has been estimated , one can proceed to directly test our method , as follows .",
    "take two fiber segments and write a @xmath64 phase - shifter ( ps ) into each .",
    "attach them co - linearly ( i ) in the order ps - fiber - ps - fiber , ( ii ) in the order fiber - ps - ps - fiber , and perform a photon counting measurement .",
    "our method should reduce attenuation in ( i ) by comparison to ( ii ) .",
    "we have proposed a method to reduce quantum noise in optical fibers , via the insertion of phase - shifters at appropriately spaced intervals .",
    "we have shown that , in principle , this method can eliminate all quantum noise processes that do not involve photon number operators in the system - bath hamiltonian ; when such terms do arise , the phase shifters need to be supplemented with beam - splitters , and our conclusions remain .",
    "thus , with simple linear - optical devices , quantum noise in optical fibers can be drastically reduced .",
    "this conclusion has potentially important implications for quantum communication ( and its variants , quantum cryptography and distributed quantum computing ) via optical fibers .",
    "the practical feasibility of our method hinges on the required distance between phase - shifters .",
    "we have given a rough upper - bound estimate of several meters based on known attenuation rates .",
    "we have also presented a more detailed calculation that predicts a range of distances , depending on the bath spectral density appropriate for a fiber .",
    "ultimately we believe that the best way to test our proposal is to perform the relatively straightforward experiment that it implies .",
