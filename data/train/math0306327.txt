    "let @xmath8 be a monic polynomial @xmath9 , @xmath10 . in 1958",

    "the actual breakthrough in the erds conjecture was made recently by a.   eremenko and w.   hayman in @xcite .",
    "they proved that for any degree @xmath11 there exist a polynomial @xmath17 which maximizes the length of @xmath16 ( following @xcite , we call it an _ extremal _ polynomial ) ; moreover , the estimate @xmath18 holds , where @xmath19 denotes the length of @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",

    "another difficulty in the study of the problem is the absence of any explicit formulae for the _ length function _",

    "let now choose @xmath48 , such that @xmath293 becomes the length function .",
    "then ( [ equ : appl - def ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath294 let @xmath295 .",
    "we can assume also that @xmath296 is a simple zero of @xmath8 , since the arguments similar to that given below show that the general case also leads us to the same form of the main equation ( [ equ : appl - g ] ) .",
    "then it follows from the definition of @xmath297 that @xmath298 and consequently we have from ( [ equ : appl - def ] ) : @xmath299 whence @xmath300 .",
    "moreover , it follows from ( [ equ : determinant ] ) that @xmath301 and changing the notations @xmath302 and @xmath303 we arrive at @xmath304 taking into account that @xmath305 we obtain after integration and a suitable changing the variables @xmath306 that @xmath307 with @xmath308 .    to analyze the last equation",
    "we suppose that @xmath309 is a positive integer and @xmath310 .",
    "then the set of solutions to ( [ equ : appl - g ] ) is still large and such elementary functions as @xmath311 , @xmath312 , @xmath313 , @xmath314 satisfy these conditions ( see table  [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "first , we notice that under our assumptions the integral @xmath315 where the principal branch of the root is chosen , defines a univalent function @xmath183 in the unit disk @xmath316 since the real part of the derivative @xmath317 is positive and we can apply the noshiro - warschawski theorem @xcite .",
    "thus , for any @xmath318 the function @xmath319 given by @xmath320 is analytic ( and univalent ) in @xmath321 , @xmath322 and satisfies ( [ equ : appl - g ] ) there .",
    "we call such a function @xmath323 a @xmath283-_function_.            let @xmath333 a @xmath334-function with parameters @xmath309 , @xmath335 , and @xmath336 . then @xmath337 and after comparing with ( [ equ : appl - def ] ) we have @xmath338 , @xmath339 , @xmath340 .",
    "we notice that in our previous notations the function @xmath341 is a solution of ( [ equ : appl - diff - eq ] ) where @xmath48 .",
    "hence , letting @xmath342 and @xmath343 one can readily see from ( [ equ : appl - diff - eq ] ) that @xmath344\\tau l'(\\tau)+(k^2 \\tau^{2\\nu}-1)l(\\tau)=0.\\ ] ]    further , the change of variables @xmath345 and @xmath346 reduces ( [ equ : appl - l ] ) to the hypergeometric canonic form @xmath347 y'(x)-\\left(\\frac{k+1}{2\\nu}\\right)^2y(x)=0.\\ ] ] the general solution to ( [ equ : appl - canonic ] ) in @xmath348 can be written as follows @xmath349 where @xmath350 ( see @xcite ) .    taking into account that @xmath351 is a simple zero of @xmath323 we conclude that the length function @xmath352 as @xmath353 .",
    "thus , @xmath354 is a bounded function near @xmath355 . since @xmath356 ( see @xcite ) ) we have @xmath357 and after substitution of the old notations we arrive at @xmath358 the precise form of @xmath359 can now be found by the asymptotic behavior @xmath360 on the other hand , by the definition of @xmath283-function @xmath361 and the theorem is proved .    in the case",
    "@xmath362 , the last theorem is still meaningful provided that the level sets @xmath363 are compact or",
    "_ periodic _ curves ( the last , e.g. , corresponds to @xmath364 ) .",
    "these cases are treated in @xcite .",
    "here we describe an explicit structure of the measure function ( for monic polynomials ) @xmath85 when @xmath89 , i.e. the interval @xmath366 is free of critical values of @xmath77 .",
    "the latter means that the corresponding lemniscates @xmath367 , @xmath368 , are single - component closed curves .",
    "[ theo : shimorin ] let @xmath12 be a monic polynomial of degree @xmath11 and @xmath369 is the largest singular value .",
    "then for all @xmath370 the following representation holds @xmath371 and @xmath372 here @xmath373 is the @xmath335th laurent coefficient of @xmath374 near the infinity , where @xmath375 .",
    "let @xmath376 be chosen arbitrary .",
    "then @xmath377 is a simple jordan curve which is the boundary of a simply - connected domain @xmath378 let @xmath379 .",
    "then @xmath74 maps @xmath380 onto @xmath381 .",
    "since @xmath382 in @xmath383 the analytic function @xmath384 , @xmath385 as @xmath386 , is well defined in @xmath380 .",
    "moreover , @xmath183 is univalent in @xmath380 for all @xmath370 .",
    "we denote by @xmath387 the inverse function which is also a univalent function and observe that @xmath388 we have @xmath389 as @xmath390 and letting @xmath391 we obtain @xmath392 it follows that @xmath393 is a well - defined analytic function in @xmath394 ( for sake of completeness let @xmath395 ) .",
    "thus , it can be expanded in the laurent series @xmath396    next , we observe that for @xmath370 , the curve @xmath377 is homeomorphic to a circle and can be naturally parameterized by @xmath397 where @xmath398 is the unit circle , and we have for the length function @xmath399 where convergence of the corresponding series for @xmath376 follows from that one in ( [ equ : laurent ] ) .    to establish ( [ qq ] ) we note that it follows from ( [ equ : len1 ] ) that @xmath400 is a decreasing function in @xmath401 and continuous in @xmath402 ( see theorem  [ th - er1 ] ) .",
    "thus , the right - hand side of ( [ equ : len1 ] ) is at most @xmath403 for all @xmath376 .",
    "then it follows from positivity of the terms of the corresponding series and the mentioned continuity that ( [ equ : len1 ] ) is still true for @xmath404 , which in turn yields ( [ qq ] ) and completes the proof .",
    "the estimate easily follows from ( [ equ : sigma ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", the same formula shows that the left - hand side of ( [ equ : low - est ] ) , denote it by @xmath406 , is a decreasing function as @xmath370 and @xmath407 which proves a sharp character of ( [ equ : low - est ] ) .",
    "we recall ( see @xcite ) that a function @xmath410 is _ completely monotonic _ in @xmath411 if it has non - negative derivatives of all orders there : @xmath412 a function @xmath410 is said to be completely monotonic in @xmath413 if it is continuous there and satisfies ( [ equ : cm ] ) in @xmath411 .      finally , we briefly discuss the mentioned in corollary  [ corol : cont ] analytic continuation property . in the post critical case @xmath376 this fact can be established directly",
