    "the observation of quantum - mechanical behaviors in nanoelectromechanical systems , in particular , nanomechanical resonators ( namrs ) for testing the basic principles of quantum mechanics blencowe2004physrep , schwab2005phystoday , cho2003science has become a topic of considerable interest and activity . besides their wide range of potential applications , @xcite e.g. , serving as ultrasensitive sensors in high - precision displacement measurements , and detection of gravitational waves , quantized namrs are potentially useful for quantum - information processing .",
    "for example , namrs may serve as a unique intermediary for transferring quantum information between microwave and optical domains because they can be coupled to electromagnetic waves of any frequency .",
    "@xcite    at very low temperatures ( in the milli - kelvin range ) , namrs of high - vibration frequencies ( gigahertz range ) have recently been experimentally verified to approach the quantum limit .",

    "a formidable challenge ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) in this field is to detect the quantum quivering ( zero - point motion ) of an namr so as to quantitatively verify whether it has been cooled into the quantum - mechanical regime or not . to directly detect the extremely small displacements of an namr vibrating at gigahertz frequencies by using available displacement - detection techniques is very difficult .",

    "it is based on the detection of the current correlation spectrum in a charge detector , e.g. , a quantum - point contact ( qpc ) , which is indirectly coupled to an namr via a double quantum dot ( dqd ) acting as a quantum - electro - mechanical transducer .",
    "geller - cleland2005pra - sun2006pra based on this proposal , we show that one can observe the quantum behaviors of the namr and can further verify whether it has been cooled into the quantum regime .",
    "in contrast to a previous approach based on the superconducting qubit coupled to a cavity , which involves rabi splitting , @xcite our proposed setup is expected to provide better tunability via the gate voltages .",
    "moreover , we also study the effects of the backaction from the charge detector on the dqd .",
    "we consider a coupled namr - dqd system in the strong _ dispersive regime _",
    "where the coupling strength @xmath1 is much smaller than the frequency detuning @xmath2 between the dqd and the namr . in this regime ,",
    "energy quanta in the namr are only virtually exchanged between the dqd and the namr .",
    "thus , the coupling of the dqd to the namr does not change the occupation state of the electron in the dqd , but only results in phonon - number - dependent frequency shifts in the dqd energy levels .",

    "<S> in addition , the effects of the coupling strength between the dqd and the namr on these energy shifts are studied . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the impacts on the current correlation spectrum of the qpc due to the backaction from the charge detector on the dqd . </S>"
