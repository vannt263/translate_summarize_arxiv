    "the forces of nature generally reveal their properties by how they act on matter . on the most fundamental material scale",

    "these take two forms , leptonic matter and quark matter .",
    "the former do not have any strong interactions , that is they lack a property called  color charge \" , which allow quarks to bind together either mesonically or baryonically .",

    ", we concentrate on how such forces effect quarks , especially the @xmath3 quark .",
    "light matter consists mostly of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 quarks . in 1963 cabibbo showed that weak interactions of mesons and baryons containing @xmath6 quarks were suppressed with respect to those without @xmath6 quarks by an amount @xmath7 , where the  cabibbo \" angle @xmath8 must be determined experimentally @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 was further shown to have an important and at that time a mystifying role , by the discovery of cp violation in @xmath9 decays in 1964 @xcite . when the @xmath10 quark was discovered in nov .",
    "1974 @xcite(though its existence was speculated earlier @xcite ) , it became clear that @xmath8 was the mixing angle between two quark doublets , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "however , it is not possible to generate a cp violating phase with only two quark doublets .",
    "this was recognized even before the discovery of the charm quark by kobayashi and maskawa , who postulated the existence of yet another quark doublet @xmath13 @xcite , in work for which they were awarded the nobel prize in 2008 . while the @xmath14 quark is the heaviest , having a mass of 173 gev , they are difficult to produce and decay before they can form a hadron , thus excluding many otherwise possible studies . much interesting",
    "work has been done with the @xmath6 and @xmath10 quarks , but in this article we discuss the physics of the @xmath3 quark , which turns out to be the most interesting of the six quarks to study .",
    "first we will discuss how particles formed with @xmath3-quarks fit into current paradigm of particle physics , the  standard model \" ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "the sm has at its basis the gauge group su(3)xsu(2)xu(1 ) .",
    "the first term corresponds to the strong interaction and su(3 ) describes the octet of colored gluons which are the strong force carriers of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "su(2)xu(1 ) describes the weak interaction and is the product of weak isospin and hypercharge .",
    "we speak of the fundamental objects being spin-1/2 quarks and leptons and the force carriers generally spin-1 objects .",
    "the spin-0 higgs boson , yet to be discovered , is necessary for generating mass @xcite",
    ".    particles containing @xmath3 quarks can be @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , or @xmath18 mesons , depending on whether the light anti - quark that it pairs with is @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , or @xmath22 , or a baryon containing two other quarks .",
    "mesons containing @xmath3 and @xmath23 quarks are also interesting especially for studies of quantum chromodynamics , but will not be discussed further in this article , as we will concentrate on weak decays and discuss strong interactions as an important and necessary complication that must be understood in many cases to extract information on fundamental @xmath3 quark couplings .",

    "the pdg @xcite gives the @xmath4 quark mass between 1.5 - 3.3 mev and the @xmath5 mass between 3.5 - 6.0 mev , where the large range indicates the considerable uncertainties .",
    "] decays usually proceed within generations , so the @xmath10 decays predominantly to the @xmath6 quark via the quark level process @xmath27 , though some decays do go to the first generation as @xmath28 .",
    "the ratio of these amplitudes approximate the cabibbo angle discussed earlier .    the mixing matrix proposed by kobayshi and maskawa @xcite parameterizes the mixing between the mass eigenstates and weak eigenstates as couplings between the charge + 2/3 and -1/3 quarks .",
    "we use here the wolfenstein approximation @xcite good to order @xmath29 : @xmath30    in the standard model @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are fundamental constants of nature like @xmath35 , or @xmath36 ; @xmath34 multiplies the imaginary @xmath37 and is responsible for all standard model cp violation . we know",

    "now we have mostly matter .",
    "how did it happen ?",

    "( the operation of charge conjugation ( c ) takes particle to anti - particle and parity ( p ) takes a vector @xmath54 to @xmath55 . )    these criteria are all satisfied by the standard model .",
    "@xmath53 is violated in electroweak theory at high temperature , though baryon minus lepton number is conserved ; in addition we need quantum tunneling , which is powerfully suppressed at the low temperatures that we now have .",
    "non - thermal equilibrium is provided by the electroweak phase transition .",
    "c and cp are violated by weak interactions .",
    "however the violation is too small .",
    "the ratio of the number of baryons to the entropy in the observed part of the universe needs to be @xmath56 , while the sm provides many orders of magnitude less .",
    "therefore , there must be new physics @xcite .",
    "our worry is why the planck scale at @xmath57 gev is so much higher than the scale at which we expect to find the higgs boson , @xmath58100 gev .",
    "as lisa randall said @xcite  the gist of it is that the universe seems to have two entirely different mass scales , and we do nt understand why they are so different .",
    "there s what s called the planck scale , which is associated with gravitational interactions .",
    "it s a huge mass scale , but because gravitational forces are proportional to one over the mass squared , that means gravity is a very weak interaction . in units of gev , which is how we measure masses ,",
    "the planck scale is 10@xmath59 gev .",
    "then there s the electroweak scale , which sets the masses for the w and z bosons .",
    "these are particles that are similar to the photons of electromagnetism and which we have observed and studied well .",
    "they have a mass of about 100 gev .",
    "so the hierarchy problem , in its simplest manifestation , is how can you have these particles be so light when the other scale is so big . \"",
    "we expect the explanation lies in physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "when we make measurements on @xmath0 decays we observe the contributions of sm processes as well as any other processes that may be due to physics beyond the sm or new physics ( np ) .",
    "other diagrams would appear adding to those in figure  [ bdiagrams2 ] with new intermediate particles .",
    "thus , when it is declared by those who say that there is nt any evidence of np in @xmath0 decays , we have to be very careful that we have not absorbed such new evidence into what we declare to be sm physics .",
    "there are several approaches that can be followed .",
    "one approach is to simply predict the decay rate of a single process in the sm with known couplings and compare to the measurements .",
    "the classical case here is @xmath60 and we will discuss this and other specific examples later .",
    "another approach is make different measurements of the ckm parameters in different ways and see if they agree .",
    "this is normally done by measuring both angles and sides of the ckm triangle , but other quantities can also be used .",
    "this is the approach used by the ckm fitter @xcite and ut fit groups @xcite . in yet a third approach , the exact same quantity can be measured in several ways , even if can not be predicted in the sm .",
    "an example here is measuring the cp violating angle @xmath45 using @xmath61 decays that proceed through the diagram in figure  [ bdiagrams2](b ) , at least in the sm , and another process that uses the  penguin \" diagram in figure  [ bdiagrams2](f ) , e.g. @xmath62 .",
    "the punch line is that if new , more massive particles exist in a mass range accessible to the lhc then they must contribute to rare and cp violating @xmath0 decays",
    "! even if measurements are precise enough only to limit the size of these effects , the properties of these new particles will be much better understood .",

    "although @xmath4 , @xmath10 and @xmath14 quark exchanges are all shown , the @xmath14 quark plays a dominant role mainly due to its mass , as the amplitude of this process is proportional to the mass of the exchanged fermion .    under the weak interactions the eigenstates of flavor degenerate in pure qcd can mix .",

    "both groups find a non - zero value of both @xmath203 and @xmath202 , though their values are not in particularly good agreement .",
    "the hfag average is shown in figure  [ pi+pi- ] along with the experimental results .",
    "the value of @xmath203 clearly is not zero , thus demonstrating direct @xmath133 violation .",
    "( historically , this was an important observation because it showed that @xmath133 violation could not be due to some kind of  superweak \" model ala wolfenstein @xcite . )",
    "the non - zero value of @xmath203 shows the presence of at least two amplitudes , presumably tree and penguin , in addition to the mixing amplitude , making extraction of @xmath44 difficult .",
    "all is not lost , however .",
    "gronau and london @xcite showed that @xmath44 could be extracted without theoretical error by doing a full isotopic spin analysis of the @xmath220 final state .",
    "the required measurements include : @xmath203 , @xmath202 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , and @xmath223 .",

    "unfortunately , current data show a relative large @xmath225 rate , compared with @xmath226 , implying a large penguin contribution @xcite , and the limit is very weak .",
    "use of the @xmath227 final state is in principle quite similar to @xmath228 , with some important caveats .",
    "first of all , it is a vector - vector final state and therefore could have both @xmath133 + and @xmath133- components .",
    "it is however possible , doing a full angular analysis to measure the @xmath133 violating phase separately in each of these two amplitudes .",
    "the best method for this is in the  transversity \" basis and will be discussed later @xcite in section  [ sec : transversity ] .",
    "it is possible , however , for one polarization component to be dominant and then the angular analysis might not be necessary .",
    "in fact the longitudinal polarization is dominant in this case .",
    "babar measures the fraction as @xmath229 @xcite , and belle measures it as @xmath230 @xcite .",
    "thus we can treat this final state without worrying about the angular analysis and just apply a correction for the amount of transverse amplitude .",
    "in addition , @xmath33 mesons are wide , so non-@xmath0 backgrounds could be a problem and even if the proper @xmath0 is reconstructed , there are non - resonant and possible @xmath231 contributions . furthermore , it has been pointed out that the large @xmath33 width could lead to the violation of the isospin constraints and this effect should be investigated @xcite .",

    "the value of @xmath32 is in agreement with that found by blucher and marciano @xcite .",
    "the fact that there is an overlap region common to all the measurements shows no obvious deviation from the standard model , which does not predict values for @xmath39 and @xmath40 , but merely that the various measurements must find the same values .    to search for deviations from the sm it is useful to compare measurements involving @xmath133 violating loop diagrams , where imaginary parts of amplitudes come into play , with measurements of the sides of triangle .",
    "the ut fit group shows in figure  [ ut - comp ] a comparison in the @xmath39-@xmath40 plane of angle measurements with those of the sides of the unitarity triangle .",
    "the overlap regions in both cases are consistent .",
    "it remains to set limits on new physics .",
    "we allow for np to contribute to the mixing amplitude of either @xmath64 or @xmath17 mesons , which we consider separately .",
    "then the amplitude of this second order ( @xmath234 ) flavor changing interaction can be expressed as @xmath235\\cdot \\langle b_q \\left| { \\cal h}^{sm+np}_{\\delta f=2 } \\right|\\overline{b}_q \\rangle~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath236 specifies the type of neutral @xmath0 meson , and @xmath237 gives the relative size of np to sm physics .",

    "we assume that there is no np in the tree level observables starting with the magnitudes @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath241 , and @xmath87 .",
    "since since @xmath46 is measured using tree level @xmath242 decays we include it in this category .",

    "quite large values of the real part of np amplitudes are allowed . in the @xmath17 case a large negative value of the imaginary part",
    "is also preferred , but again the effect is only 2.7@xmath109",
    ". we can conclude that we need to do a lot more work to constrain np in these transitions .",
