    "this can not be expected because the system is finite .",
    "we can , however , get a glimpse at luttinger liquid behaviour in a special limit , which also presupposes a large particle number @xmath13 .",

    "it is seen that @xmath117 depends linearly on the wave number deviation in a small region near the fermi edge .",
    "this can be compared with the luttinger liquid prediction ( cf .",
    "e.g. , @xcite )    @xmath118    @xmath119 is a constant and the exponent @xmath120 depends on the luttinger liquid coupling strength @xmath121 according to    @xmath122    and    @xmath123    we conclude that the above limit of our model agrees with the case @xmath124 of the luttinger liquid .",

    "asymptotic results with respect to the fermion number @xmath13 were obtained for the one - particle matrix elements and used to discuss occupation probabilities for oscillator states , off - diagonal matrix elements , and distribution functions for particles and momenta in the harmonic trap .",
    "all these quantities can be significantly affected by the attractive interaction generated within each component .",
    "specifically , the friedel oscillations in the particle density are suppressed , while they survive in the momentum density .",
    "it has to be seen , whether the predicted friedel oscillations can be observed experimentally .",

    "the method proposes microfabrication techniques to produce arrays of microtraps .    on the other hand ,",
    "the asymptotic bosonization method requires particle numbers , which are not too small .",
    "this is due to the presence of the anomalous vacuum , which couples to the real particles .",
