    "it is well known that magnetic reconnection plays an important role in the dynamic solar corona , where it is a key process in eruptions ( flares , filament eruptions , coronal mass ejections ) , jets , and other phenomena . in the lower solar atmosphere ,",
    "magnetic reconnection is also very common in different forms of activity , such as microflares ( e.g. , brosius & holman 2009 ; gontikakis , winebarger , & patsourakos 2013 ) , the flux cancellation process in the photosphere ( e.g. , zwaan1987 ; van ballegooijen & martens 1989 ; cameron , vgler , & schssler2007 ) , chromospheric jets ( e.g. , chae , moon , & park 2003 ; shibata et al . 2007 ; liu et al . 2009 ; shen et al .",
    "2011 ; shen et al .",
    "2012 ; morton 2012 ; bharti , hirzberger , & solanki 2013 ) , and temperature enhancements in ellerman bombs ( e.g. , zachariadis , alissandrakis , & banos1987 ; denker1997 ; dara et al.1997 ; qiu et al.2000 ; georgoulis et al .",
    "2002 ; fang et al . 2006 ) .",
    "magnetic reconnection probably plays an important role as the energy source for the heating of the chromosphere and corona ( e.g. , parker 1972 ; sturrock 1999 ; klimchuk 2006 ) .",
    "the source of the mass and energy in the solar wind may also be related to magnetic reconnection in the lower solar atmosphere .",
    "compared to the solar corona , the mass density and plasma @xmath7 in the chromosphere and photosphere are higher , and the temperature is much lower , mostly below @xmath8  k , except in the upper chromosphere . therefore , the plasma in this height range is only partially ionized with an ionization degree of about @xmath9 .",
    "the magnetic diffusivity is of order @xmath10  m@xmath11s@xmath3 in the range from the upper photosphere to the middle chromosphere , so that the lundquist number ( magnetic reynolds number ) for a length - scale @xmath12  mm and alfvn velocity @xmath13  kms@xmath3 is of order @xmath14 . the classical sweet - parker model for a current sheet of this length yields a reconnection rate @xmath15 , far smaller than the reconnection rates inferred for events of chromospheric activity .",
    "for example , @xcite estimated @xmath16 for chromospheric anemone jets from their life time and the estimated alfvn crossing time .",
    "the same estimate for type - ii spicules , which have life times of 10150  s , sizes of @xmath17  km , and ambient alfvn velocities based on the total density of @xmath18  kms@xmath3 @xcite , yields @xmath19 .",
    "such and even larger disparity is typically found for weakly ionized astrophysical plasmas like , for example , the interstellar medium and protostellar and protoplanetary disks ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "many numerical simulations applied to phenomena of solar activity employ ` anomalous ' resistivity enhancements to obtain fast reconnection . however , the exact forms of anomalous resistivity used in magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) models are not directly deducible from the kinetic theory and simulations of real physical systems , and therefore some simplifying assumptions are still required for the model of anomalous resistivity ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .    steady - state reconnection rates in weakly ionized plasma can be significantly enhanced above the sweet - parker value by radiative cooling and by ambipolar diffusion ; however , both are efficient only if the guide field is weak .",
    "radiative cooling reduces the pressure in the current sheet , thus allowing the sheet to thin and , correspondingly , the current density to rise .",
    "this implies higher lorentz forces accelerating the reconnection outflow , resulting in an enhancement over the sweet - parker rate of order @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the compression factor of the sheet due to the cooling @xcite . in the incompressible strong guide field case ,",
    "the cooling leads to a weaker enhancement of the reconnection rate through the higher resistivity , but in a chromospheric environment this can hardly reach an order of magnitude .",
    "ambipolar diffusion in the current sheet decouples the ions and neutrals , so that only the ion pressure is available to balance the lorentz force , which results in a strong current sheet thinning for weak ionization , allowing rapid flux annihilation @xcite .",
    "the enhancement over the sweet - parker reconnection rate can be very large in the special case of antiparallel field @xcite , however , already a tiny guide field component suppresses this fast reconnection regime @xcite .    in partially ionized plasma",
    ", fast reconnection also results from the recombination effect under non - equilibrium ionization conditions .",
    "the numerical results from a two fluid model in the papers by @xcite indicate that the reconnection rate can been increased to above 0.05 solely due to the decoupling of neutrals from ions .",
    "therefore , when the neutral - ion collisional mean free path exceeds the current sheet width , the two - fluid model including the recombination effect should be applied in studying the reconnection process .",
    "reconnection also becomes fast when the current sheet thins down to the ion inertial scale @xmath22 where the hall term is relevant @xcite .",
    "however , a dynamic regime of reconnection which involves plasmoids ( magnetic islands ) realizes high reconnection rates already at current sheet widths typically several orders of magnitude larger than @xmath22 ; this is now commonly referred to as the plasmoid instability @xcite .",
    "the motion of the plasmoids in the current sheet is largely constrained by ideal mhd @xcite ; hence , it is fast and largely independent of the resistivity , forming a highly efficient internal engine of fast reconnection .",
    "the instability cascades to smaller scales such that current sheet sections between newly formed islands break up as well ; the resulting high current densities in the increasingly thin current sheet fragments also facilitate a high reconnection rate .",
    "moreover , this mechanism operates for current sheets with and without a guide field .",
    "its high relevance for reconnection in the solar corona , especially for flares , has recently been demonstrated in a number of simulation studies ( e.g. , murphy et al .",
    "2012 ; mei et al .",
    "2012 ; guo et al .",
    "the plasmoid instability has recently been found to occur also in simulations of reconnection in weakly ionized plasma @xcite .",
    "plasmoids indicating the action of the instability were detected in laboratory experiments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in the solar corona in the course of eruptions ( e.g. , lin , cranmer , & farrugia 2008 ; savage et al .",
    "2010 ; milligan et al .",
    "2010 ; takasao et al .",
    "2012 ; liu 2013 ) , as well as in chromospheric jets @xcite .",
    "the plasmoid instability occurs only if the lundquist number and the aspect ratio @xmath23 of the current sheet are sufficiently large , where @xmath24 is the current sheet width .",
    "both are related through the sweet - parker scaling for the current sheet width , @xmath25 . for fully ionized plasma ,",
    "the critical lundquist number , @xmath26 , typically lies in the range of several @xmath27 to several @xmath8 , decreasing for increasing plasma @xmath7 in the inflow region ( e.g. , bhattacharjee et al . 2009 ; huang & bhattacharjee 2010 ; ni et al . 2010 ; ni et al . 2012 ; ni et al .",
    "the minimum aspect ratio correspondingly is of order @xmath28 .",
    "fast reconnection at a rate @xmath29 was found for @xmath30 .",
    "@xcite find the onset of the plasmoid instability in partially ionized plasma in basic agreement with this value .    since the characteristic lundquist number estimated for chromospheric reconnection events is much higher than the critical lundquist number for onset of the plasmoid instability , and since this process yields high reconnection rates for weak and strong guide fields , we focus on the plasmoid instability in chromospheric reconnection in the present investigation , considering both the regimes of strong and of vanishing guide field . parameters characteristic of the middle solar chromosphere and a low plasma @xmath7 in the inflow region are considered .",
    "the energetically and dynamically important processes of radiative cooling and ambipolar diffusion are included , and their effect on the reconnection rate is compared with the effect of the cascading plasmoid instability .",
    "the formation of slow - mode shocks associated with the x - points between the plasmoids is demonstrated .",
    "finally , we compare the obtained reconnection rates , upward reconnection outflow velocities , and temperature enhancements with the values typically seen in or inferred for events of chromospheric activity .",
    "the model and numerical method are described in the following section . in section  3",
    ", we present our numerical results and compare them with observations of chromospheric activity phenomena .",
    "a summary and discussion are given in section  4 .",
    "we only consider the hydrogen gas , so that the plasma is composed of neutral hydrogen atoms , ions ( protons ) and electrons . in general",
    "this system is described by the three - fluid mhd equations . however",
    ", a single - fluid approximation adding up all three equations can be used if the collisional coupling between ions and neutrals is strong , which is valid on length - scales exceeding the neutral - ion collisional mean free path @xmath31 .",
    "the relevant length - scale here is the current sheet width @xmath24",
    ". we will find below that parameter values characteristic of the middle chromosphere yield critical current sheet widths for onset of the plasmoid instability several orders of magnitude above @xmath31 , indicating that the onset and initial evolution of the instability in this part of the solar atmosphere can generally be described using the one - fluid equations .",
    "since the instability tends to cascade to small scales comparable to the ion inertial length , which can be of similar magnitude as @xmath31 or smaller ( depending on the ion density ) , it is clear that a complete description of plasmoid - mediated reconnection in the chromosphere will require a multi - fluid treatment ( such as recently developed by @xcite ) .",
    "however , the present investigation demonstrates that the plasmoid instability occurs and yields high reconnection rates already within the validity range of the one - fluid approximation adopted here .",
    "since the neutrals are coupled to the ions in this approximation , the kinematic behaviour of the plasma bears a considerable degree of similarity to the fully ionized case , but radiative losses and ambipolar diffusion can nevertheless influence the dynamics strongly .",
    "additionally , we approximate the gas pressure tensor as a scalar , assume isothermal conditions ( for simplicity and in the absence of detailed information to the opposite ) , @xmath32 , and neglect heat conduction .",
    "the latter is based on the fact that heat conduction is energetically less important than radiative cooling for the high densities and low temperatures characteristic of the middle chromosphere .",
    "additionally , heat conduction into and out of plasmoids is largely across the magnetic field , especially in a two - dimensional description , thus , it tends to be small ( see section  [ s : discussion ] for a detailed discussion ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , one can reasonably expect that the plasmoid cascading process tends to continue to even smaller scales than resolved here , down to the ion inertial length @xmath22 . in partially ionized plasma the process is modified by recombination within the plasmoids , reducing their current and flux @xcite , and it is not yet known how this influences the cascading process .",
    "a less dynamical evolution of the plasmoids is conceivable , but since the cascading occurs between previously formed plasmoids , it appears unlikely that recombination within plasmoids would suppress it completely .",
    "this is indeed indicated by the results in @xcite , who find that that the plasmoid instability can raise the reconnection rate also beyond the validity range of the one - fluid approximation .",
    "we thus expect that the multiple levels of the plasmoid instability process connect the global , large mhd - scale reconnection with the local , small kinetic - scale reconnection also in partially ionized plasma .",
    "it is well known that the plasmoid instability in fully ionized plasma yields a high reconnection rate throughout the cascading process , and our simulations demonstrate that the cascading plasmoid instability operates in weakly ionized plasma in the one - fluid limit in basically the same manner as in fully ionized plasma , reaching a high reconnection rate as well .",
    "as is well known , reconnection at @xmath4-points always involves slow - mode shocks in the petschek regime . in our simulations",
    ", we find that many small - scale slow - mode shocks form transiently at the edge of secondary plasmoids , attached to the neighboring @xmath4-point in a secondary fragment of the current sheet .",
    "3 shows a pair of such shocks .",
    "sudden changes of the magnetic field direction and current density at the left and right edges of the plasmoid can clearly be seen ; these are very similar to the slow - mode shock structure displayed , e.g. , in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "3(b ) shows that the temperature increases strongly not only within the current sheet fragment but also downstream of the slow - mode shocks in the plasmoid .",
    "the angle between the shock front and the @xmath58-direction is @xmath145 .",
    "4 displays the magnetic field and the current density along a cut in the @xmath55-direction at @xmath146 .",
    "one can see that the magnitude of the field component tangential to the shock , @xmath147 , decreases rapidly toward the downstream side and that the current density @xmath148 has a peak where @xmath147 changes rapidly , but the component normal to the shock , @xmath149 , stays nearly uniform along the cut .",
    "this is exactly the behavior of a slow - mode shock .",
    "similar structures exist in the outflow region of the current sheet .",
    "these slow - mode shocks could be a candidate mechanism to explain the chromospheric heating @xcite .",
    "we now compare the simulation results of the three cases which were run for model  i. the reconnection rate is computed as the rate of change of the magnetic flux accumulated between the @xmath150-point in the primary island at @xmath80 and the main reconnection @xmath4-point ( see ni et al .",
    "2012 ; ni et al .",
    "2013 ) , @xmath151 here the flux function @xmath152 is defined through the relations @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and the main reconnection @xmath4-point is determined as the @xmath4-point which has the highest @xmath152 value of all @xmath4-points in the box .",
    "this analysis is performed on the relatively low grid refinement level  3 which ensures uniform coverage of the current sheet section from the primary @xmath150-point to the upper boundary throughout the runs .",
    "this choice still captures much of the temporal variability of the reconnection rate .",
    "local quantities like the current density , temperature , and current sheet width at the main reconnection @xmath4-point are determined at the highest refinement level chosen by the code , to evaluate their full dynamic range ; after the onset of the plasmoid instability this is level  10 in all nine cases . the current sheet width is determined as the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the current density profile in @xmath55 direction .",
    "the reconnection rate for cases  a  c is displayed in fig .",
    "the three cases are very similar to each other and show a dynamical behaviour that is basically analogous to reconnection in fully ionized plasma , as expected from our one - fluid approximation , especially for case  a in the absence of heating , radiative cooling , and ambipolar diffusion . up to @xmath155",
    "s the reconnection rate remains at a low level , reaching the sweet - parker value of @xmath156 for @xmath157  s. at this time the decreasing current sheet width has also reached the sweet - parker value @xmath158  m. this appears to be a sweet - parker reconnection phase , which is also supported by the elongated , smooth appearance of the current sheet ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] ) .",
    "subsequently , a fast rise of the reconnection rate commences , which quickly saturates at a level @xmath159 .",
    "the first secondary islands due to the plasmoid instability have clearly developed by the end of the fast rise , which we thus interpret as the linear phase of the plasmoid instability .",
    "all quantities show the high variability characteristic of the plasmoid instability in the further evolution .",
    "the current sheet width , measured at the main @xmath4-point , gradually decreases in the sweet - parker phase and enters a rapid decrease down to @xmath160  m simultaneously with the onset of the plasmoid instability ( fig .",
    "this minimum current sheet width is comparable to the grid scale at refinement level  10 ( @xmath161 ) but still much larger that the neutral - ion collisional mean free path and the ion inertial length ( table  1 ) , so that our one - fluid approximation is valid throughout the computation .",
    "the current density at the main @xmath4-point shows a rather close inverse proportionality to the current sheet width .",
    "the average reconnection rate remains at a high level throughout the cascading phase of the instability .",
    "it shows a trend of gradual decrease to an average level of @xmath162 which is most likely due to the shortening of the active section of the current sheet as the primary island at @xmath80 grows ; the field lines in the inflow region must then bend increasingly before reconnecting at the @xmath4-point .",
    "the temperature at the main @xmath4-point increases rapidly from the onset of the plasmoid instability , saturating at @xmath163  k ( fig .",
    "the corresponding decrease of the magnetic diffusivity raises the effective lundquist number in the course of the plasmoid instability by nearly an order of magnitude .",
    "it should be noted that the peak temperature in the current sheet , located within the islands downstream of the slow - mode shocks , continues to rise , reaching @xmath164  k during the plasmoid instability .",
    "the comparison of cases  a and b shows that the radiative cooling hardly has any effect on the evolution of the reconnecting current sheet at the chosen parameters of the middle chromosphere if the sheet includes a considerable guide field .",
    "this is fully in agreement with earlier investigations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which had pointed out that a sufficiently strong guide field suppresses the current sheet thinning due to radiative cooling by making the sheet incompressible . the only remaining effect on the reconnection rate is given by the temperature dependence of the magnetic diffusivity",
    "@xcite considered the case that radiative cooling in a stationary sweet - parker sheet with negligible heating increases the reconnection rate in this way .",
    "however , heating is a key factor of the energy balance in the chromosphere , and so our model also includes a heating term which is adjusted to match the initial cooling rate and to have the same dependence on the density .",
    "consequently , the radiative losses will not cool the plasma below the initial temperature @xmath94 ; they have a strong effect only when the temperature increases considerably above @xmath94 .",
    "lower temperatures can be reached by adiabatic cooling if the plasma expands ( an effect seen below in fig .  [ fig.9 ] ) , but this is not the case here at the @xmath4-point , where the temperature has the same value as in case  a during the sweet - parker phase ( fig .",
    "the subsequent fast reconnection dominated by the plasmoid instability is largely independent of the magnetic diffusivity @xcite .",
    "temperatures of @xmath165 are reached in this phase , as in case  a , which shows that the strong heating at the slow - mode shocks dominates the radiative losses in this phase .",
    "considering the effect of ambipolar diffusion in case  c , again only a weak influence on the reconnection rate is found .",
    "the only differences to cases  a and b are a more impulsive and slightly earlier onset of the plasmoid instability and a somewhat higher variability near the end of the sweet - parker phase .",
    "we interpret this behaviour as follows . in the sweet - parker phase a strong thinning of the current sheet",
    "is inhibited by the guide field @xcite .",
    "the ambipolar electric field nevertheless increases strongly as the sheet thins in response to the initial perturbation .",
    "however , the area of enhanced @xmath166 does not reach the plane @xmath167 where the antiparallel field component reverses sign , but rather forms two layers on either side of of the field reversal plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig.11](a ) , ( c ) ) .",
    "thus , it does not amplify the annihilation of the field in this plane .",
    "the width of the layers , @xmath168  m , agrees with the ion - neutral decoupling length scale @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is the alfv@xmath171n velocity based on the ion density @xcite .",
    "as a dominant @xmath4-point develops , the associated reconnection flows convect the two layers with enhanced ambipolar electric field to the field reversal plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig.11](b ) , ( c ) ) , so that it now contributes to the change of flux ( equation  [ e : induction ] ) .",
    "the comparison of figs .",
    "[ fig.11](a ) and ( b ) shows that the rate of change of the magnetic field in the sweet - parker - like current sheet is dominated by the resistive contribution to the electric field , whereas it is dominated by the ambipolar electric field during the rapid rise of the reconnection rate at the first @xmath4-point of the commencing plasmoid instability .",
    "the layers of enhanced ambipolar field intermittently approach the field reversal plane already during the considerable thinning of the current sheet in the final part of the sweet - parker phase ( fig .",
    "6(a ) ) , causing the intermittent moderate enhancements of the reconnection rate seen in fig .",
    "since the inclusion of the ambipolar diffusion terms causes a strong decrease of the adaptive time step , this run was terminated after the reconnection rate reached the saturation level .",
    "the three cases also show a very similar current sheet aspect ratio at the onset of the plasmoid instability . we refer to this quantity as the `` onset aspect ratio '' and",
    "determine it from the current sheet width @xmath172 and the similarly defined fwhm length of the current sheet in @xmath58 direction , @xmath173 .",
    "we find @xmath174  m and @xmath175  m , i.e. an onset aspect ratio @xmath176 in all three cases ( see fig .  8 for case  b ) .",
    "this value lies considerably above the critical aspect ratio for onset of the plasmoid instability at the point of transition between the sweet - parker and plasmoid - mediated reconnection regimes , @xmath177 , when the lundquist number is varied to reach the critical value @xmath178 @xcite .",
    "our simulations are performed with far higher lundquist numbers in the range @xmath179 ( varying in time due to the evolving @xmath172 and @xmath180 ) , and correspondingly the current sheet aspect ratio rises considerably above the critical value @xmath177 , roughly aproaching @xmath181 .    in summary , in current sheets with a strong guide field , the plasmoid instability mediates a fast reconnection regime in partially ionized plasma , while radiative cooling and ambipolar diffusion have only very little effect . for the parameters of the middle chromosphere ,",
    "the reconnection rate is enhanced by a factor @xmath182 above the sweet - parker rate , reaching the range of observationally inferred values .",
    "next we consider the harris current sheet with vanishing guide field ( model  ii , cases  d  f ) .",
    "a major difference to all corresponding runs for model  i is the much slower evolution of the current sheet , due to our choice to realize the necessary pressure enhancement in the sheet by a density enhancement and the resulting smaller alfvn velocity in the sheet .",
    "the reconnection rate , which is normalized to the field strength and alfvn velocity in the inflow region , thus takes a much longer time to rise .",
    "the density in the current sheet gradually decreases during our runs , and eventually the alfvn velocity in the sheet becomes comparable to the external alfvn velocity .",
    "the reconnection rate then reaches similar values as in model  i.    in all three cases run for model  ii , reconnection rates exceeding the sweet - parker value develop only from the onset of the plasmoid instability ( fig .",
    "[ fig.8 ] ) , which happens at @xmath183 , 84 , and 50  s for cases  d , e , and f , respectively ( figs .",
    "5(b ) and 8) .",
    "a sweet - parker - like regime develops only transiently , for @xmath184  s prior to the onset of the plasmoid instability , in cases  d and e as the current sheet width approaches the sweet - parker value ( fig .",
    "as for model  i , the onset of the plasmoid instability is associated with a rapid decrease of the current sheet width . due to the high inertia of the plasmoids in the initially dense current sheet ,",
    "the instability shows a far more gradual overall development compared to the strong guide field cases .",
    "the reconnection rate in case  d without radiative cooling and ambipolar diffusion does not reach saturation but rather rises essentially monotonically ( apart form the small time - scale fluctuations characteristic of the instability ) until the main @xmath4-point leaves the box through the upper boundary at @xmath185  s. a peak reconnection rate of @xmath186 is then reached ; it would be somewhat higher ( lower ) if the box were chosen somewhat larger ( smaller ) .",
    "the current sheet width continues to decrease in the course of the cascading plasmoid instability until it reaches @xmath187  m , as in model  i. the temperature at the @xmath4-point reached at the end of the run , @xmath188  k , is also similar to the result for model  i.    the evolution in case  e with radiative cooling and heating is qualitatively similar to case  d , but it commences earlier and is more impulsive . here",
    "the current sheet width drops to @xmath187  m , and the reconnection rate rises to @xmath186 , in about one half of the time .",
    "this more dynamic behaviour is related to a faster decrease of the density in the current sheet after @xmath189  s. it appears that the reconnection rate saturates at this level until it sharply drops as the main @xmath4-point leaves the box at @xmath190  s. the effect of the radiative cooling again remains minor prior to the onset of the plasmoid instability .",
    "the current sheet is then only slightly thinner than in case  d ( figs .",
    "6(b ) and 8) .",
    "the effect of radiative cooling becomes more obvious at the high temperatures in the course of the plasmoid instability , limiting the temperature to about half the peak value found in case  d ( fig .",
    "radiative cooling in case  d acts more efficiently than in case  b because here the densities are higher .",
    "as expected in the absence of a guide field , the inclusion of ambipolar diffusion in case  f allows the current sheet to thin very efficiently @xcite .",
    "the evolution here begins with a rapid decrease of the current sheet width at the main x - point down to @xmath187  m ( within @xmath191  s ) , which is near its smallest value observed in all runs at the amr refinement levels 10 and 11 .",
    "a thinning by a factor 500 is expected from the ratio of ion and neutral pressure ( the inverse ionization degree for our isothermal conditions ) when only the ion pressure in the sheet balances the magnetic pressure of the external region .",
    "the actual thinning goes beyond that by a factor @xmath192 , but this already includes the onset of the plasmoid instability at @xmath193  s and @xmath194  m. the instability seamlessly grows out of the current sheet collapse mediated by the ambipolar diffusion , without leaving room for a sweet - parker - like phase , since the onset aspect ratio is obviously reached during the collapse .",
    "the reconnection rate grows in a manner similar to cases  d and e , at least to a level @xmath195 .",
    "it is possible that it would grow to higher values if the run could be continued .",
    "however , the main reconnection x - point has moved out of our simulation domain after @xmath196  s. it is seen that the reconnection rate then suddenly decreases to a low value , similar to cases  e and d. overall , the dynamical evolution of the plasmoid instability appears to be similar to cases  d and e , including the temperatures reached at the main @xmath4-point ( fig .",
    "7(b ) ) , so that a saturation of the reconnection rate at similar levels is conceivable .",
    "the current sheet widths and aspect ratios for onset of the plasmoid instability are , approximately , 1200  m and 500 in case  d , 950  m and 730 in case  e , and 80  m and 1250 in case  f ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.8 ] ) .",
    "the onset occurs at a higher aspect ratio when the sheet thins more dynamically .    to summarize the runs for model  ii without guide field ,",
    "we find a basic analogy to the strong guide field cases in that the plasmoid instability is the dominant mechanism to realize fast reconnection , with rates similar to the strong guide field cases .",
    "although our simulations confirm the strong thinning of the current sheet allowed by ambipolar diffusion and anticipated to yield an accelerated sweet - parker - like reconnection regime @xcite , this regime does not occur because the aspect ratio for onset of the plasmoid instability is reached by the end of the ambipolar diffusion - driven current sheet thinning .",
    "an accelerated sweet - parker - like reconnection due to radiative cooling of the current sheet does not occur in our model because we include a background heating term representing the chromospheric heating .",
    "we find that the inclusion of gravity and density stratification in model  iii has surprisingly little effect on the main results found for models  i and ii , although the density varies by two orders of magnitude in the relevant height range @xmath197 .",
    "specifically , ( 1 ) the plasmoid cascading process shown in fig .",
    "2 is very similar to models  i and ii ; ( 2 ) the reconnection rate , current sheet width and temperature at the main x - point for cases  g  i in model  iii behave very similar to those for cases  a  c in model  i , respectively ( figures  57 ) ; ( 3 ) many fine slow - mode shock structures attached around the edges of the plasmoids appear , where the highest temperatures are produced ; ( 4 ) the onset aspect ratios for models  i and iii are the same , as shown in fig .  8 and table  1 ; ( 5 ) radiative cooling and ambipolar diffusion have little effect on the plasmoid instability in model  iii ; ( 6 ) the maximum out - flow velocity in model  iii is the same as in model  i , about @xmath198  kms@xmath3 .",
    "the similarity of the reconnection rate , which is normalized by the same value of @xmath199 as in model  i , and other quantities at the main x - point can be understood from the rather similar values of the alfvn velocity at that point in models  i and iii , with the alfvn velocity initially being higher in model  iii by only a factor @xmath200 ; this implies a similar dynamic behavior in the vicinity of the main x - point .",
    "there are some details in the reconnection process which are different in models  i and iii . as shown in figs .",
    "8 and 9 , the current sheet gradually becomes inclined to the side , especially after secondary islands appear .",
    "this is due to gravity acting on the dense plasmoids , which form slightly asymmetrically about the current sheet as a consequence of roundoff errors .",
    "secondary islands in model  iii start to appear later than in model  i for the same initial perturbation . in the period before",
    "secondary islands appear , the hottest plasma exists in the up - flow region in model  iii ( figure  10 ) , but in the down - flow region in model  i ( not shown ) .",
    "since low - density plasma can be heated more easily , the rapid decrease of the plasma density with increasing height in model  iii is the main reason for this difference . for case",
    "h , the hottest plasma usually appears around the edge of the plasmoids , but their center is still relatively much cooler ( figure  10 ) , the reason being that the plasma density inside the plasmoids is higher and , therefore , radiative cooling is stronger . during the reconnection process ,",
    "the main x - point in model  iii gradually moves to a higher place compared to model  i , as seen in figures  9 and 12 . with radiative cooling , this results in a higher temperature for model  iii ( @xmath201  k in case  h vs. @xmath202  k in case  b ) .",
    "micro - jets have been frequently observed in the low atmosphere ( e.g. , liu et al .",
    "2009 ; morton 2012 ; singh et al . 2012 ; bharti , hirzberger , & solanki 2013 ) .",
    "magnetic reconnection is being considered as one of the mechanisms that may cause the ejection of these jets .",
    "their velocity is usually found in the range of 10150  kms@xmath3 .",
    "the average speed of chromospheric jets around the edges of sunspots is around 30  kms@xmath3 ( morton 2012 ) .",
    "[ fig.12 ] shows that the upward outflow velocity @xmath203 can reach about 40  kms@xmath3 in the strong guide field model with radiative cooling and about 25  kms@xmath3 in the zero guide field model .",
    "these upward reconnection outflow velocities are close to the typical velocities of chromospheric jets .",
    "higher outflow velocities ( by a factor @xmath204 ) from a chromospheric current sheet with zero or weak guide field can be expected if the sheet is not overdense as in our model  ii .",
    "the outflows become intermittent in the course of the plasmoid instability as relatively large merged islands are convected out of the sheet ( fig .",
    "[ fig.12 ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to observations of plasmoids in chromospheric jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "many observations demonstrate that chromospheric jets can be heated to the transition region temperature ( e.g. , teriaca , curdt , & solanki 2008 ) .",
    "pointed out that `` slower '' ( @xmath205  kms@xmath3 ) jet events near sunspots involve @xmath113  k plasma and could play a role in heating the chromosphere and corona .",
    "although radiative cooling is included in cases  b and e , these simulations yield temperatures in the current sheet region of several @xmath8  k ( figs .  3 , 7 , and [ fig.10 ] ) , and the plasma immediately downstream of the slow - mode shocks and in turbulent regions between secondary islands is heated to temperatures of the lower transition region , @xmath164  k. therefore , our simulations demonstrate that magnetic reconnection driven by the plasmoid instability in the low atmosphere contributes to chromospheric heating .",
    "magnetic reconnection in the middle chromosphere , including radiative cooling , heating , and ambipolar diffusion effects , has been studied in the 2.5-dimensional mhd approximation . a harris current sheet model with either a strong guide field ( models  i and  iii ) or vanishing guide field ( model  ii ) is considered .",
    "we have assumed that the plasma consisting of ions , electrons and neutral hydrogen atoms is strongly coupled and in ionization equilibrium state , that the pressure is isotropic , and that the heat flux can be neglected .",

    "amr allowed us to resolve three levels of secondary islands and current sheet widths down to @xmath187  m , where the one - fluid approximation is still valid .",
    "ambipolar diffusion and radiative cooling have a significant influence on the reconnection process only in the model with vanishing guide field .",
    "ambipolar diffusion then leads to the expected strong current sheet thinning @xcite , but the current sheet thins very fast , reaching the onset aspect ratio , such that an accelerated sweet - parker reconnection regime does not develop , but rather the plasmoid instability sets in .",
    "the expected strong current sheet thinning in a sweet - parker regime due to radiative cooling @xcite does not occur in our simulations because we include a background heating term .",
    "this thinning can generally not be expected to be strong in the middle and lower chromosphere , where the temperature is hardly higher than twice the solar temperature minimum .",
    "both ambipolar diffusion and radiative losses have an effect on the plasmoid instability for vanishing guide field , implying , respectively , a much earlier onset and a faster development , but apparently no significant increase in the reconnection rate .",
    "many slow mode shocks are generated between secondary plasmoids and secondary fragments of the current sheet during the unstable reconnection process .",
    "downstream the shock front regions ( in the plasmoids ) , the temperature is highest and reaches @xmath207  k , i.e. , lower transition region temperatures .",
    "this supports conjectures in the literature that fast magnetic reconnection is a candidate mechanism for the chromospheric heating .",
    "upward outflow velocities in the course of the plasmoid instability reach @xmath2  kms@xmath3 and @xmath208  kms@xmath3 in the strong and zero guide field cases , respectively .",
    "outflow velocities higher by a factor @xmath192 are expected in the zero guide field case if the initial current sheet were not chosen to be over dense .",
    "these values lie in the range observed for chromospheric jets .",
    "dynamic plasmoids yield variations in the outflow , consistent with observations of plasmoids in chromospheric jets .",
    "recent work by @xcite has studied the effects of recombination on reconnection in the middle chromosphere in a two - fluid model ( weak coupling between ions and neutrals ) .",
    "this also included the occurrence of the plasmoid instability .",
    "reconnection rates of order 0.1 were found to result from recombination effects , while the plasmoid instability gave only a minor additional increase of @xmath209% .",
    "recombination within the plasmoids reduces their current , which may slow down the dynamics of the plasmoid instability .",
    "it thus appears that recombination must ultimately be included for a complete description of reconnection in partially ionized plasma .",
    "however , the small increase of the reconnection rate due to the plasmoid instability in @xcite results in part from their choice of a high magnetic diffusivity , @xmath210  m@xmath11s@xmath3 , which is about two orders of magnitude higher than a typical magnetic diffusivity in the middle chromosphere and did not change with temperature .",
    "our diffusivity is @xmath211  m@xmath11s@xmath3 initially and decreases to @xmath212  m@xmath11s@xmath3 as the current sheet is heated in the course of the plasmoid instability .",
    "this gives a difference in @xmath38 of up to three orders of magnitude .",
    "in @xcite the diffusivity was computed for chromospheric temperatures and of order @xmath213  m@xmath11s@xmath3 before the onset of the plasmoid instability , much closer to our values .",
    "the reconnection rate then reached @xmath214 , only a factor @xmath215 above our value .",
    "thus , the high reconnection rate found in @xcite results in part from the high diffusivity chosen in this paper .",
    "the reconnection rate of @xmath214 in @xcite is due to recombination effects and higher but comparable to the reconnection rate we find during the plasmoid instability .",
    "after the onset of the plasmoid instability in @xcite , the reconnection rate shows a steep increase , which could only be followed up to @xmath216 , since the current sheet width then reached the resolution limit .",
    "the steep increase can be taken as an indication that the plasmoid instability is potentially very important in the weak coupling description of chromospheric reconnection as well .",
    "additionally we note that @xcite used the magnetic field and alfvn velocity in the upstream region not very far from the current sheet to normalize the reconnection rate , while we used the asymptotic inflow values .",
    "our reconnection rates increase by a factor 23 if we use the magnetic field and alfvn velocity at distances in the range 520 current sheet half widths ( @xmath217 ) .",
    "since the initial plasma density at the initial main reconnection x - point ( @xmath218 ) in our models ( @xmath219m@xmath118 in models  i and iii ) is more than 10 times higher than that in their models ( @xmath220m@xmath118 ) , and the initial temperature(@xmath221  k ) is lower than in their models ( @xmath222  k ) , our models represent the conditions at somewhat smaller heights in the chromosphere .",
    "our simulations do not include thermal conduction , which can generally be expected to be energetically less important than radiative cooling at chromospheric temperatures of @xmath223  k which dominate in the major part of our simulated volumes .",
    "much higher temperatures and steep temperature gradients are built up in the plasmoids and at the slow - mode shocks and x - points .",
    "conductive energy transport from these regions into the inflow regions and into the big plasmoid at the bottom end of the current sheet is largely directed across the magnetic field ( conduction in the third direction , parallel to the field , is not relevant in our 2.5-dimensional simulations ) .",
    "thermal conduction by the charged particles is very strongly suppressed in the direction perpendicular to the field ; however , the contribution by the neutral component is not influenced .",
    "deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) allow a neutral component to be present even at the high temperatures that we find in the plasmoids . to estimate the potential magnitude of thermal conduction for the conditions of our simulations , we follow @xcite .",
    "they find that the thermal conductivity across the field is provided by the neutral component in the whole temperature range relevant here and give the coefficient of thermal conductivity in a pure hydrogen gas as @xmath224 where @xmath225 is the molecular weight and @xmath226  m@xmath11 is the neutral - neutral collisional cross section ( note that @xcite use @xmath227 to designate the cross section ) .",
    "since the ionization degree is small and does not change with time , @xmath228 in our models . under these conditions ,",
    "the coefficient of thermal conductivity is evaluated as @xmath229 where @xmath180 is measured in kelvin and the dimension of @xmath230 is jk@xmath3m@xmath3s@xmath3 .",
    "the thermal conduction is given by @xmath231 our temperature gradient scale ( slow - mode shock width ) is typically @xmath168  m. for the temperature as high as @xmath232  k , the resulting thermal conduction @xmath233 is about @xmath234  jm@xmath118s@xmath3 .",
    "this falls in the range of radiative cooling relevant in our models . considering model  iii , which encompasses densities @xmath235  m@xmath118 and corresponding ionization degrees @xmath236 , and using @xmath237 as a conservative estimate , plasma at @xmath238  k cools radiatively at rates of @xmath239  jm@xmath118s@xmath3 .",
    "this suggests that neutral thermal conduction could limit the rise of the temperature in model  i and in the upper part of the volume in model  iii , where the densities are relatively low .",
    "however , if the evolution of the ionization degree were also included , neutral thermal conduction can be expected to be negligible . at @xmath232",
    "k the ionization degree is very high , e.g. , @xcite give @xmath240 in their table  5 , so that the estimate of the neutral conductive heat flux drops by this factor and is thus lower that the radiative losses by at least four orders of magnitude throughout the range of parameters studied in this paper . additionally , more recent considerations of the collisional cross sections @xcite indicate a value for @xmath241 higher by an order of magnitude than given by @xcite .",
    "the above estimates should be checked in future simulations of chromospheric reconnection when non - equilibrium ionization is also taken into account .",
    "effects of potential relevance but not yet included in our model are radiative transport and non - lte effects , non - equilibrium ionization effects , and at very small scales the hall effect .",
    "additionally , the complex topology of the chromospheric magnetic field has not yet been addressed .",
    "it is currently impossible to include all of them in a single model .",
    "perhaps the most relevant steps beyond our approximations are the inclusion of recombination effects in a two - fluid description , more complex magnetic topologies guided by the observations , and radiative transport .",
    "regarding the latter extension , we note that several estimates of the reconnection rate in plasmas with radiative cooling in @xcite were found to not depend sensitively on the specific properties of the cooling process .",
    "also , the effect of radiative losses is only a weak to moderate one in the computations presented here .",
    "these facts may be taken as an indication that the inclusion of radiative transport in the optically thick case would not strongly influence most of our results .",

    "<S> magnetic reconnection in the partially ionized solar chromosphere is studied in 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations including radiative cooling and ambipolar diffusion . </S>",

    "<S> slow - mode shocks extend from the @xmath4-points , heating the plasmoids up to @xmath5  k. in the case of zero guide field , the inclusion of ambipolar diffusion and radiative cooling both cause a rapid thinning of the current sheet ( down to @xmath6  m ) and early formation of secondary islands . </S>",
    "<S> both of these processes have very little effect on the plasmoid instability for a strong guide field . </S>",
    "<S> the reconnection rates , temperature enhancements , and upward out - flow velocities from the vertical current sheet correspond well to their characteristic values in chromospheric jets . </S>"
