    "motivated by the encouraging predictions on performance enhancement of wireless networks enabled by cell densification , network operators are showing huge interest in small - cells .",
    "in fact , in common scenarios cell densification is expected to provide a linear gain in terms of throughput delivered by the network as the number of nodes increases @xcite .",
    "in addition , the overall transmit power used by all the base stations decreases with the density of nodes , while guaranteeing linear throughput gain @xcite . as a consequence of these two results",
    ", we will show later in this paper that the energy efficiency under full buffer traffic regime is monotonically increasing , meaning that the efficiency also increases with the node density .",
    "nonetheless , as such results seem to be too optimistic , it is reasonable to question whether they are generally true or , instead , if they come as a consequence of too simplistic system models .",
    "hence , in this paper we investigate the effect of a combined line - of - sight ( los ) and non line - of - sight ( nlos ) propagation model on the area spectral efficiency ( ase ) gain and we study the related energy efficiency of cell - splitting .",
    "we show that modelling the signal propagation according to the combined los / nlos path - loss provides a different picture of the ase and of the energy efficiency behaviour than what would emerge if either los or nlos propagation only were used instead .",
    "in particular , the main contributions of this paper are the following .",
    "first , we show that the ase gain is no longer a linear function of the cell density but , as a consequence of the combined los / nlos propagation , it exhibits superlinear behaviour at low cell densities and sublinear behaviour at high cell densities .",
    "second , we show that the energy efficiency is not a monotonically increasing function but has a global maximum for a given node density .    therefore ,",
    "on the basis of our findings , we make the argument that the signal propagation model has a strong impact on the performance trend in small - cell networks and that particular attention should be paid in choosing the correct propagation model when addressing some specific investigations in extremely dense networks .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sect : relatedwork ] we discuss the main results of the related work on ase and energy efficiency in small - cells networks . in section [ sec : systemmodel ] we describe the path - loss model and the methodology applied in our study .",
    "we then provide the results of the ase and of the transmit power per base station in section [ sec : simulation_results_part_i ] . in section [ sec : energy_efficiency ]",
    "we discuss how the los / nlos propagation affects the energy efficiency and we present the simulation results .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "investigation on the throughput gain achieved by increasing the cell - density in wireless networks has been done in recent years .",
    "the authors in @xcite have shown analytically that when the network is interference limited and the base stations are distributed according to a spatial poisson point process ( sppp ) , increasing the cell density yields linear increase of the network throughput . regarding the transmit power ,",
    "an investigation on the overall transmit power needed by the network to achieve linear ase gain has been proposed in @xcite . however",
    ", a single slope propagation model is assumed for the studies proposed in both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "some work on area spectral efficiency gain of cell splitting under different propagation models can be found in the literature .",
    "the authors in @xcite addressed the problem of assessing the throughput gain in indoor scenarios and specifically , they considered a propagation model proposed by @xcite which has an exponential component . under this assumption ,",
    "the area spectral efficiency gain is proved to scale as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of nodes . however , this propagation model has only been proposed for indoor scenarios . furthermore , the authors of @xcite address neither the transmit power nor the energy efficiency related to this propagation model .",
    "the problem of the energy efficiency vs spectral efficiency trade - off has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite make use of stochastic geometry to carry out an analysis of the optimal energy efficient and of the optimal spectral efficient regimes of the network .",
    "nonetheless , the problem formulation proposed in @xcite assumes that the user is kept at a fixed distance from the base station and this distance remains unchanged while the node density varies .",
    "although this is a reasonable assumption in scenarios where there are small variations of the node density , in our paper we investigate the effect of large variations of the cell density .",
    "hence , the model proposed in @xcite would not be accurate for our analysis .",
    "moreover , a single slope propagation model is assumed by the authors in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consizder the combined los / nlos path - loss model recommended by the 3rd generation partnership project ( 3gpp ) for studying heterogeneous networks . in particular , we opted for the outdoor propagation model for pico - cells / hotzones @xcite which is the following : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the path - loss exponents for los and nlos propagation , respectively ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the signal attenuations at distance @xmath7 for los and nlos propagation , respectively ; @xmath8 is the probability that the base station is in line - of - sight with the user ; @xmath8 is a function dependent on the base station - to - user distance @xmath9 and is given by the following equation : @xmath10 in this paper we refer to the path loss model described by eq .",
    "and as _ combined los / nlos _ propagation model . on the contrary , we refer to the more common model @xmath11 as _ single slope _ propagation model , as in a logarithmic scale it becomes a linear function .    with the values of the parameters @xmath5 , @xmath3 , @xmath6 , @xmath4 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 which will be given later in table [ table : simulation - parameters ] , the nlos channel attenuation increases with a higher slope than the los one .",
    "also , the probability of having los propagation decreases with the distance .",
    "overall , with the combined los / nlos model , the ase and the energy efficiency in small - cells networks show different behaviours than those observed with the single slope model .      in this paper",
    "we first make use of simulation results to assess the ase and the transmit power in dense networks with combined los / nlos propagation model .",
    "we then apply curve fitting for extrapolating the trend of the ase and of the transmit power as functions of the node density . finally , by means of the mathematical functions obtained through data fitting",
    ", we analyze the behaviour of the energy efficiency and we explain why the los / nlos propagation model yields different results on the energy efficiency as a function of the node density compared to the single slope propagation model .",
    "we obtained the results following the steps reported below :    1 .",
    "we use a system level simulator to compute the wideband signal to interference ratio ( sir ) of the users .",
    "we first assume the network is interference limited and that all the base stations transmit over the same band , i.e. , reuse 1 is used .",
    "we run simulations for different values of cell density .",
    "we compute the transmit power necessary in order to ensure the users experience coverage and throughput as close as possible to the case of interference limited network as the cell density varies . our criterion to compute the transmit power",
    "will be explained later in section * * .",
    "we then compute the ase .",
    "3 .   we use curve fitting to determine how the ase and the transmit power scale with the node density . based on these throughput and power trends",
    "we also compute the energy efficiency ( see section [ sec : energy_efficiency ] ) .",
    "the transmit power per base station should be set in order to guarantee that the network remains in interference - limited regime , i.e. , the transmit power should be high enough so that the thermal noise power at the user receiver can be neglected with respect to the interference power at the receiver . under this condition",
    ", the sinr will not be limited by the transmit power .",
    "in fact , with the network in interference limited regime , the transmit power is high enough that any further increase of it would be pointless in terms of enhancing the sinr , since the receive power increment would be balanced by the exact same interference increment .",
    "if we translate this concept into the analysis of sinr cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) , we have that the sir cdf @xmath14 $ ] is the limit of the sinr cdf @xmath15 $ ] as the transmit power tends to infinity .",
    "hence , to keep the network in interference - limited regime , the power should be set to a value high enough to guarantee the sinr cdf curve to be close to its upper bound , i.e , the sir cdf curve . to achieve this , we impose a condition on the difference between the sir and sinr cdfs i.e. , we compute the minimum transmit power per base station so that the inequality @xmath16 is verified .    for setting the numerical values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 we consider the users located close to the serving base station which usually experience low interference and high sinr .",
    "the sinr of these users is sensitive to the changes of the transmit power , as the interference here is less severe and then the user might not be in interference - limited regime .",
    "this means that imposing @xmath19 for high values of sinr ( equivalently , for high percentages",
    "@xmath17 ) is a stricter condition on the power than for low values of sinr .",
    "we believe that the values @xmath20 and @xmath21 we set in our simulation are strict enough to guarantee the network to be interference - limited .",
    "we use a function of the kind @xmath22 to interpolate the simulation results of ase and transmit power per base station .",
    "we chose this function because it is suitable to fit sets of ase data with linear behaviour ( i.e. , @xmath23 ) , superlinear behaviour ( i.e. , @xmath24 ) and sublinear beviour ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) .",
    "moreover , as in logarithmic scale the function @xmath22 turns to be a linear function whose slope ( in logarithmic scale ) is @xmath26 , we are particularly interested in determining the values of @xmath26 , as this parameter characterizes the steepness of the ase and of the transmit power as a function of the node density .",
    "also the function @xmath22 turns to be mathematically tractable when , later on in section , we need to compute the derivative of the energy efficiency .",
    "in this section we present the simulation results we obtained with the parameters setting given in table [ table : simulation - parameters ] .",
    "regarding the scenario , we consider a small - cell network where the base stations distribution follows both a regular geometric pattern and a spatial poisson point process ( sppp ) model .",
    "we assume the base stations to be pico base stations with omni - directional antennas .",
    "nonetheless , since the two models provide similar results , we will show the results regarding the sppp only for the ase ; we will then consider the square grid model for the transmit power per base station and for the energy efficiency later in section [ sec : energy_efficiency ] .",
    ".simulation parameters [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the fact that the transmit power per base station decays more or less steeply with the density @xmath27 depends on how quickly the interference power increases or decreases with @xmath27 . as we explained in section [ sub : computing - the - transmit ] , the transmit power per base station @xmath28 has to be set so that the network is interference limited .",
    "thus , if the channel attenuation between the interferer and the user decreases quickly as the density increases , a lower transmit power will be enough to guarantee that the interference power is greater than the noise power .",
    "in other words , if the interferer - to - user channel attenuation tends to decrease quickly as the density increases , so does the transmit power and vice - versa .",
    "this explains why within range @xmath29 the transmit power @xmath28 decreases steeply with slope @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , as explained in section [ sub : area_spectral_efficiency ] , as @xmath27 increases within range @xmath29 , the probability of having interferers in los with the user rises and , as a consequence , we have a lower attenuation of the channel between the interfering base station and the user .",
    "hence , the @xmath28 which guarantees the network to be in the interference - limited regime will also decrease steeply as @xmath27 increases . on the contrary , within range @xmath31 , most of the interferers will have already entered the los zone ( see section [ sub : area_spectral_efficiency ] ) , meaning that the interferer - to - user channel attenuation drops less rapidly than within range @xmath29 ; for this reason , also @xmath28 will decrease less rapidly than within range @xmath29 .",
    "let us note that the transmit power per base station as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : transmit_power ] tends to be low , as it goes even below 0 dbm for densities higher than @xmath32cells / km@xmath33 . if we compare these values with the indications given by 3gpp documents @xcite for simulations of pico - cell scenarios ( suggested power per pico cells is between 30dbm and 20dbm ) , we notice a substantial difference .",
    "however , the 3gpp recommendations for the pico - base station transmit power are meant for isolated cells covering hotzones ; on the contrary , in our scenario the network is entirely covered by small cells . as a cell in a dense network covers a considerably smaller area than in the case of isolated cells , the required transmit power per base station is much lower compared to the case of an isolated cell .",
    "regarding the computation of the energy consumption we assume a fully loaded network , i.e. , there are more users than bss and every bs transmits to a non - empty set of users .",
    "we further assume full buffer traffic and full spectrum reuse ; hence , there are always data to transmit and the bss use all the time and frequency resources available .",
    "we model the power consumption @xmath34 of the base station assuming that @xmath34 is the sum of two components , i.e. , @xmath35 ; the first , denoted by @xmath36 , takes into account the energy necessary for signal processing and to power up the base station circuitry .",
    "this power @xmath36 is modelled as a component being independent of the transmit power and of the base station load @xcite .",
    "the second component , denoted by @xmath37 , takes into account the power fed into the power amplifier which is then radiated for signal transmission .",
    "the power @xmath37 is considered to be proportional to the power transmitted by the base station ; we can thus write @xmath38 , where @xmath39 takes into account the losses of the power amplifier (",
    "i.e. , we assume @xmath39 to be the inverse of the power amplifier efficiency ) .    under these assumptions , the power consumed by the cellular network made of @xmath1 base stations can be written as follows : @xmath40 where @xmath1 can also be written as @xmath41 , with @xmath42 denoting the area of the network and @xmath27 denoting the density of base stations . as we have shown in section [ sub : txpowerperbs ] , the transmit power @xmath43 varies as a function of @xmath1 or , equivalently , of @xmath27 .",
    "in this paper we are interested in characterizing the energy efficiency of the network as a function of the node density to identify the trade - off between the area spectral efficiency and the power consumed by network .",
    "we define the _ energy efficiency _ as the ratio between the overall throughput delivered by the network and the total power consumed by the wireless network .",
    "we can write the energy efficiency as follows : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the network throughput which can be written as @xmath46 , with * @xmath47 * denoting the bandwidth and @xmath48 denoting the area spectral efficiency .      when the path - loss can be expressed as @xmath11 , increasing the node density yields linear throughput gain @xcite , @xcite",
    "; therefore , the throughput can be written in the form @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a constant .",
    "also , the transmit power of each base station can be scaled as @xmath51 @xcite ; the effect of the power amplifier losses is taken into account in @xmath52 .",
    "hence , the energy efficiency becomes : @xmath53 if we compute the derivative of @xmath54 , we obtain @xmath55 , which is strictly positive for any node density value @xmath56 . hence , under the assumption of single slope propagation model , increasing the node density yields higher energy efficiency independently of the value of @xmath57 of the propagation model .",
    "nonetheless , as the density keeps increasing , the transmit power will become negligible compared to @xmath58 , meaning that the power consumption will be almost entirely impacted by the power offset @xmath58 .",
    "hence , we obtain that @xmath59 , i.e. , the energy efficiency saturates and converges to @xmath60 .      as we mentioned in section [ sub :",
    "computing - the - transmit ] , we will use functions of the kind @xmath22 to interpolate both the data on area spectral efficiency ( and then throughput ) and also on the transmit power per base station .",
    "we then expect the throughput to be in the form of @xmath61 and the power in the form @xmath62 .",
    "thus , with this assumption , we obtain the following expression for the energy efficiency @xmath63 the derivative of @xmath54 is given below : @xmath64 depending on the value of @xmath65 and of @xmath66 , there can exist optimum points of the function @xmath54 .",
    "in the following paragraphs , we analyze the derivative @xmath67 in order to assess the existence of such optima .",
    "let us note that @xmath68 , @xmath36 and @xmath69 are positive ; moreover it is reasonable to assume that @xmath70 ( i.e. , the area spectral efficiency is an increasing function of the density ) and that @xmath71 , i.e. , the transmit power per bs is a decreasing function of the density .",
    "if @xmath72 , i.e. , if the ase growth is superlinear , then also @xmath73 holds true ; in this case , @xmath74 is strictly positive , meaning that energy efficiency increases as the density increases .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the ase and so the throughput grow faster than the total power used by the network , which implies adding more base stations with lower transmit power improves the energy efficiency .",
    "if @xmath75 ( i.e. , the ase growth is sublinear ) and @xmath76 , then the @xmath74 is strictly negative and then the energy efficiency is a monotonically decreasing function of the density @xmath27 .",
    "this is due to the ase which grows too slowly compared to the total power consumption of the network , making the addition of base stations in the network inconvenient from the energy efficiency point of view .",
    "if @xmath75 ( i.e. , ase gain is sublinear ) and if @xmath77 , then we obtain that the derivative @xmath74 nulls for @xmath78 , is positive for @xmath79 and is negative for @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , @xmath81 is a global maximum of the energy efficiency .",
    "this behavior of the spectral efficiency is due to the growth of the ase which is not fast enough to allow the energy efficiency to be monotonically increasing , but it is not even too slow to observe a continuous drop of the energy efficiency ; on the one hand , for low base station densities ( i.e. , for @xmath79 ) the ase gain is high enough to counterbalance the total power increase of the network , making the addition of base stations profitable in terms of energy efficiency . on the other hand , as the base station density reaches @xmath81 , the ase gain is not sufficient to compensate the power consumption increment given by any further addition of base stations in the network . * remarks * : equations and hold true only in case of full loaded networks with full - buffer traffic model . if other models of traffic or load were used , the energy efficiency would be different than what given in and .",
    "nonetheless , studying the energy efficiency of the network under different traffic models is not within the scope of this paper .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_efficiency ] we show the energy efficiency results we obtained using single slope and combined los / nlos propagation model .",
    "we considered two different values of the power offset @xmath58 , i.e. , 2w and 10w .",
    "as mentioned above in section [ sub : energy_efficiency_for_los ] , with single slope propagation the energy efficiency is monotonically increasing with the node density , meaning the addition of low power base stations in the network would provide a reward in terms of energy efficiency .",
    "however , as we pointed out in section [ sub : energy_efficiency_for_los ] , we can notice that the energy efficiency eventually saturates as the density keeps increasing .    on the other hand , if we assume combined los / nlos propagation , the behaviour of the energy efficiency as a function of the node density looks different .",
    "if we compare the values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 in table [ table : aseresults ] and [ table : powerresults ] with the cases we discussed in section [ sub : energy - efficiency - for ] , for low bs densities , i.e. , for @xmath82 , the spectral efficiency is an increasing function of @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , within this range of densities , the ase grows quickly meaning that adding base stations with lower power is beneficial in terms of energy efficiency .",
    "nonetheless , with the value of @xmath65 and @xmath66 for densities @xmath83 , the energy efficiency exhibits a maximum which is achieved for @xmath84 and @xmath85 cells / km@xmath33 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively ; beyond these points , the ase gain is too low to compensate power consumption increase of the denser network , leading to a drop in terms of energy efficiency",
    ". finally , with the value of @xmath65 and @xmath66 for densities @xmath88 , the energy efficiency is still a non - monotonic function with a stationary point ; however , this point occurs at @xmath89 cells / km@xmath33 and is then outside the range of values @xmath88 for which the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 are valid .",
    "hence , the energy efficiency is a decreasing function within @xmath31 , since the ase gain is too low to pay off the network power consumption .",
    "in this paper we have studied the effect of the combined los / nlos propagation on the area spectral efficiency and energy efficiency of dense networks . based on our study ,",
    "the estimations of the area spectral efficiency and of the energy efficiency carried out using a single slope path loss seem to provide an optimistic prediction of such metrics .",
    "in fact , if we use a combined los / nlos model as the ones recommended by the 3gpp for simulation of heterogeneous networks , the area spectral efficiency and the energy efficiency as functions of the node density exhibit different behaviours . in particular , unlike in the case of single slope propagation model where the energy efficiency is monotonically increasing , with the combined los / nlos model there exists a maximum of the energy efficiency .        c.  galiotto , n.  marchetti , and l.  doyle , `` the role of the total transmit power on the linear area spectral efficiency gain of cell - splitting , '' _ ieee commun .",
