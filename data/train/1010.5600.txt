    "rare charmless nonleptonic b meson decays give us a lot of information on the weak interactions of quarks . yet , since quarks are forever confined , this information is necessarily blended with strong interaction effects .",
    "a proper and reliable understanding of the latter is crucial for the extraction of new physics effects ( if any ) . at present",
    ", however , the only way to achieve such an understanding is through the parametrization of strong interaction effects and the subsequent extraction of relevant parameters from the experimental data .",
    "for example , it is known that the effective tree ( @xmath4 ) and colour - suppressed ( @xmath5 ) amplitudes involve contributions from some of the penguin amplitudes as well ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) . disentangling this penguin contribution from the ` true ' @xmath6 and @xmath7 amplitudes would constitute part of the proper understanding of ` standard physics ' , both at the quark- and the hadron - level , and a check on theoretical predictions at the quark level .",
    "unfortunately , achieving this goal is not possible on the basis of @xmath8 data alone , which permit an extraction of @xmath9 , but not @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , estimating the latter would require knowledge of the size of one of the two independent penguin amplitudes @xcite . knowing the branching ratio of a single purely - penguin process is not sufficient here . if the two penguin contributions are to be separated properly , additional data and some related assumptions are needed .",
    "the best place to analyse the size of penguin contributions should be in those processes in which only penguin amplitudes are present .",
    "for this reason , ref .",
    "@xcite considered @xmath11 decays in conjunction with @xmath12 . in those two processes , amplitudes @xmath6 and @xmath7 are absent and only penguin amplitudes contribute .",
    "as shown in @xcite , under reasonable assumptions concerning su(3 ) symmetry breaking , it is then possible to extract from the experimental data the relative size and phase of the two independent penguin amplitudes , and therefore estimate the effect of the penguin - induced corrections .",
    "the present paper is concerned with the extraction of the ratio of two similar penguin amplitudes from the related , but independent , decays @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "our results are fully consistent with the findings of ref . @xcite .",
    "for future comparison , we first briefly recall the notation used in @xcite for the description of penguins in @xmath15 decays , and then introduce an analogous notation for @xmath16 processes .      ref .",
    "@xcite was concerned with the extraction of independent penguin amplitudes relevant for @xmath15 decays . in that case ,",
    "when the elements of the ckm matrix were factored out , the three independent strong penguin amplitudes corresponding to internal @xmath17-quark loops ( @xmath18 ) were denoted in @xcite , @xcite by @xmath19 .",
    "because of the unitarity of the ckm matrix only two combinations of these amplitudes can be extracted from experimental data . for @xmath20 transitions we choose the following two combinations ( @xmath21 ) : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the difference of two independent penguin amplitudes , and @xmath24",
    "is given in terms of the ckm matrix @xmath25 : @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 being the wolfenstein parameters ( we do not need the actual value of @xmath27 in our calculations ) .",
    "if one assumes that the difference between the @xmath29 and @xmath30 penguin amplitudes arises solely from different ckm factors , the @xmath30 transitions may be expressed in terms of the same strong penguin amplitudes @xmath31 as the @xmath32 processes .",
    "this assumption ignores any possible dependence on the spectator quark and on the flavour of the additional quark - antiquark pair which appears in the final state and has to be produced via strong interactions .",
    "while the spectator - independence of the amplitude seems a fairly reasonable assumption , the production of the additional quark - antiquark pair may be strongly flavour - dependent , as discussed at length in @xcite .",
    "we will come to this point later .",
    "for the @xmath30 processes , the corresponding products of strong penguin amplitudes and ckm factors will be denoted with primed letters , i.e. : @xmath33 so as to distinguish them from ( unprimed ) amplitudes @xmath34 used for @xmath32 decays .",
    "we are interested in the relative size of the two independent combinations of penguin amplitudes , i.e. in the ratio : @xmath35 in order to discuss this ratio it is convenient to introduce @xcite : @xmath36 where @xcite @xmath37 in our calculations we use the central value of the sm prediction @xmath38 , which compares very well with the value of @xmath39 fitted in @xcite",
    ".      for the @xmath40 decays there are two possible cases : the spectator quark ( i.e. the quark not involved in weak interactions ) ends up either in a pseudoscalar ( @xmath41 ) or in a vector ( @xmath25 ) meson . in order to distinguish between these two cases , we introduce the subscript @xmath41 or @xmath25 in all relevant amplitudes ( hence the corresponding amplitudes are distinguished from the @xmath15 amplitudes for which we do not use a subscript ) @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) denotes full penguin amplitudes relevant in @xmath16 decays with spectator quark ending in a @xmath41 ( @xmath25 ) meson .    for the decays with the spectator quark emerging in the final pseudoscalar meson , and with the ckm matrix elements factored out",
    ", we have again three independent strong penguin amplitudes @xmath44 corresponding to @xmath17-quark running in an internal loop . as in the case of @xmath15",
    "decays , we use the unitarity of the ckm matrix to describe the relevant total penguin amplitudes in terms of two combinations ( @xmath21 ) analogous to @xmath45 of eq .",
    "( [ penguindiffpp ] ) : @xmath46 the full penguin amplitudes with spectator quark ending in a pseudoscalar meson are then @xmath47 for @xmath32 and @xmath48 transitions respectively .",
    "again , the above formulae ignore any other possible dependence on the spectator quark and any dependence on the flavour of the quark - antiquark pair that has to be additionally produced via strong interactions .    in order to discuss the ratio of penguin amplitudes",
    "@xmath49 relevant in @xmath16 decays , and to compare it later with the @xmath15 case , it is convenient to define the counterpart of eq .",
    "( [ znadzeta ] ) : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are defined analogously to eqs ( [ pq],[pprimq ] ) : @xmath53",
    "if there is no dependence on the flavour of the additional quark - antiquark pair produced via strong final state interactions , the amplitudes for the @xmath13 and @xmath1 decays are : @xmath55 using eqs ( [ pp],[pprimp ] ) and the relation @xmath56 where @xmath57 one can reexpress the above amplitudes in terms of @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 as : @xmath61 the above formulae are completely analogous to those relevant for @xmath11 and @xmath12 decays @xcite ( with the replacements @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ) .    in reality",
    ", the decays @xmath13 and @xmath14 may differ in an important way , not taken into account in the above formulae .",
    "indeed , the newly created quark - antiquark pair is produced ( long after the weak decay ) by long - range strong interactions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "now , it is known that in such strong - interaction processes - in which newly produced quarks @xmath65 and @xmath66 end up in different hadrons - the production of the @xmath67 pair is strongly suppressed at high energies when compared to that of the light @xmath68 pair . in order to take this effect into account , we modify formula ( [ kk*su3 ] ) by introducing a corresponding suppression factor @xmath69 : @xmath70 a reliable estimate of this suppression factor may be obtained using regge phenomenology as discussed in much detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that @xmath71 with @xmath72 , and @xmath73 being the intercept of regge trajectory corresponding to meson @xmath74 . since the values of the intercepts are extracted directly from high energy scattering experiments , their values take into account _ all _ final state interactions . for @xmath75",
    "one finds then that @xmath76 @xcite . in the following",

    "we now take the ratio of the two branching fractions to find that @xmath84 ( thus , we do not need the value of @xmath85 ) .",
    "the averages of experimental branching ratios for @xmath13 and @xmath1 decays are ( in units of @xmath86 ) @xcite : @xmath87 corresponding to @xmath88 .",
    "for the asymmetries @xmath89 we find : @xmath90 while the experimental value is known for the first process only , with the average @xcite : @xmath91    equations ( [ conditionrkkpik],[brexp],[asympik*],[cppik*exp ] ) provide two conditions on @xmath59 and @xmath60 . their solution yields : @xmath92 or @xmath93",
    "the second solution corresponds to @xmath94 and @xmath95 with nearly opposite phases .",
    "this is highly unlikely since the masses of @xmath96 and @xmath97 quarks are small when compared to the mass of @xmath98 quark , and - consequently - the two penguins should have similar strong phases .",
    "therefore , this solution may be discarded .",
    "for the first solution , the relevant contour plot in the ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) plane is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "the values of @xmath59 , @xmath60 extracted from experimental data on @xmath99 decays ( eq.([solution1 ] ) ) are very similar to the values of @xmath100 obtained in @xcite in a similar analysis of the @xmath101 decays .",
    "this agreement corroborates the idea that there is no essential difference between the short - range penguin transitions in @xmath15 and @xmath16 decays .",
    "the only important difference between the pure penguin - driven processes in @xmath15 and @xmath16 processes arises from final - state long - range interactions .",
    "in particular , the relative size of the relevant branching ratios indicates that one has to include the effect of @xmath2 breaking ( @xmath102 ) in the final @xmath68-creation process .",
    "it is straightforward to derive the following formula for the @xmath103 asymmetry : @xmath104    for @xmath105 one has @xmath106 with the dominant contribution to the error coming from @xmath107 .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath103 is expected to be some four times larger than @xmath107 .",
    "this is because it is not proportional to the suppression factor of @xmath108 : the two contributing penguin amplitudes are of comparable sizes .",
    "consequently , it would be interesting to have @xmath103 measured as it is particularly sensitive to the size of the relative strong phase of the two penguin contributions .",
    "+ we have found that the ratios of the two penguin amplitudes are similar in the @xmath109 and @xmath110 sectors , i.e. that they are independent of the final state , and that the su(3 ) breaking factor @xmath69 is universal .",
    "consequently , it is natural to expect that the same will be true for the @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) sector , where the spectator quark ends up in a vector meson ( i.e. that @xmath113 , and @xmath114 ) .",
    "this leads us to expect that the branching fraction of the @xmath115 decay should be approximately equal to @xmath116 an analogon of eq .",
    "( [ asymkplusk0star ] ) may also be written .",
    "it is hoped that future experimental work on @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 processes will further corroborate the ideas of this paper .",
