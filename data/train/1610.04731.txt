    "the two - particle intensity interferometry has been extensively utilized to determine the space - time extension of particle emitting sources in nuclear and particle physics over the past several decades  @xcite . in heavy ion collisions ,",
    "the two - particle interferometry is a well - recognized and powerful method to characterize the source of particle emission and to probe and disentangle different reaction mechanisms . in particular , this method can provide information on the space - time evolution of hot nuclei which usually decay by evaporation and/or ( multi-)fragmentation .",
    "even though a large number of experiments have been carried out to measure the two - proton correlation in nuclear fragmentation , almost no proton - proton momentum correlation function measurement was reported for a kinematically complete decay channel .",
    "in contrast , there have been several measurements of the neutron - neutron momentum correlation function in kinematically complete decay channels for halo nuclei , such as @xmath6li  @xcite and @xmath7be  @xcite , which were believed to be useful for studying the so - called di - neutron structure of neutron - rich nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of two - proton emission is a very interesting but complicated process existing in the nucleus close to the proton - drip line  @xcite .",
    "the proton - proton correlation plays an important role in the emission mechanism .",
    "there is a distinct difference in the spectra of the two - proton relative momentum ( @xmath8 ) and opening angle ( @xmath9 ) between the diproton emission and two - body sequential or three - body simultaneous emission .",
    "this characteristic has been used to investigate the mechanism of two - proton emissions  @xcite .",
    "the proton - rich nuclei @xmath1al and @xmath4 mg are very important in determining some astrophysical reaction rates and have attracted a lot of attention in both astrophysics and nuclear structure studies  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have reported the experimental results for kinematically complete measurements of two - proton emissions from two excited proton - rich nuclei , namely @xmath1al @xmath2 p + p + @xmath3na and @xmath4 mg @xmath2 p + p + @xmath5ne  @xcite .",
    "based on the analysis of @xmath8 and @xmath9 distributions of the two emitted protons , a favorable diproton emission component from the excited states around 14.044 mev of @xmath4 mg was observed .",
    "but no such signal exhibited in the two - proton emission processes of the excited @xmath1al .    as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is difficult to distinguish between the two - body sequential and three - body simultaneous emission mechanism using the above analysis . in these two mechanisms ,",
    "the emission time of the two protons is quite different . for three - body simultaneous emission ,",
    "the two protons are emitted almost at the same time , while the two protons are emitted one by one in sequential emission .",
    "the two - particle intensity interferometry method has been demonstrated to be a good way to extract the source size and particle emission time  @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the proton - proton momentum correlation function will be studied for the three - body decay channels @xmath1al @xmath2 p + p + @xmath3na and @xmath4 mg @xmath2 p + p + @xmath5ne . the size and emission time information of the source",

    "a primary beam of @xmath10 mev @xmath11si was used to produce secondary @xmath1al and @xmath4 mg beams with incident energy of 57.4@xmath12 mev and 53.5@xmath12 mev in the center of the carbon reaction target , respectively . after the reaction target , there were five layers of silicon detectors and three layers of plastic hodoscopes as shown in fig .",

    "the first two layers of si - strip detectors located around 50 cm downstream of the target were used to measure the emitting angle of the fragment and protons .",

    "clear particle identifications were obtained by this setup for the kinematically complete three - body decay reactions . the momentum and emission angle for protons and the residue are determined by analyzing the detector signals .",
    "the excitation energy ( @xmath16 ) of the incident nucleus was reconstructed by the difference between the invariant mass of three - body system and mass of the mother nucleus in the ground state .",

    "in the present study , the momentum correlation functions between two protons emitted from @xmath1al and @xmath4 mg are studied .",

    "this method ensures that the uncorrelated distribution includes the same class of collisions and kinematical constraints as the numerator .",
    "it has , however , a potential problem : it may attenuate the slight correlations one wishes to measure  @xcite due to the existence of possible `` residue correlation '' from initial two - proton physical correlation , which will overestimate the denominator . to eliminate this `` residue correlation '' , an iterative calculation method for the @xmath0 was applied and intrinsic correlation was extracted  @xcite .",
