    "the physical significance of the singularities of the phase of quantum mechanical wave functions has been recognized by dirac in his work on magnetic monopoles @xcite . the hydrodynamic formulation of the schrdinger theory discovered by madelung @xcite provided a vivid interpretation of the lines in space where the phase is singular .",
    "these are simply the vortex lines in the flow of the probability fluid .",
    "the velocity field @xmath0 of this fluid , defined in terms of the probability current @xmath1 , is equal to the gradient of the phase @xmath2 of the wave function @xmath3 , @xmath4 therefore , the flow is strictly irrotational in the bulk ; vorticity may live only on the lines of singularities of the phase .",
    "regular wave functions may have a singular phase only where the wave function vanishes , i.e. where @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "these two equations define two surfaces in space whose intersection determines the position of vortex lines . however , the vanishing of the wave function is the necessary but not the sufficient condition for the existence of vortex lines .",
    "they exist only if the circulation around the line where the wave function vanishes is different from zero .",
    "the univaluedness of the wave function requires the quantization of the circulation @xmath7 the importance of this condition in the hydrodynamic formulation of wave mechanics has been elucidated for the first time by takabayasi @xcite . if eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) holds for every closed contour , we may recover the phase @xmath2 ( modulo @xmath8 ) from @xmath9 up to a global , constant phase with the help of the formula @xmath10 early studies of vortex lines were restricted to wave mechanics but nye and berry @xcite have shown that phase singularities or wavefront dislocations play an important role not only in wave mechanics but in all wave theories . a general review of phase singularities in wave fields has been recently given by dennis @xcite .",
    "there is a substantial overlap of concepts ( but not of the results ) between our work and the works of berry , nye and dennis .",
    "while they concentrate mostly on the stationary vortex lines that are found in monochromatic fields , we emphasize the time evolution .",
    "more recently , the study of phase singularities and vortices in optics has evolved into a separate area of research , both theoretical and experimental , called singular optics .",
    "a recent review of this field is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to find a natural generalization of eq .",
    "( [ velocity0 ] ) , we need a replacement for the wave function @xmath11 in electromagnetism",
    ". a suitable object appears in the complex form of maxwell equations known already to riemann @xcite and investigated more closely by silberstein @xcite at the beginning of the last century . in this formulation",
    "the electric and magnetic field vectors are replaced by a single complex vector @xmath12 that we proposed to call the riemann - silberstein ( rs ) vector @xcite @xmath13 maxwell equations in free space written in terms of @xmath12 read ( @xmath14 )    [ maxwell ] @xmath15    the analogy between eq .",
    "( [ maxwell1 ] ) and the schrdinger wave equation is so close that one is lead to treat @xmath12 as the photon wave function @xcite and apply similar methods to analyze the vortex lines and their motion as we have done in refs .",
    "@xcite in nonrelativistic wave mechanics .",
    "there is , however , an important difference that requires an extension of our previous methods : the rs vector has three components instead of one .",
    "thus , there are three independent phases @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18  one for each component and it is not clear which combination of these phases should be treated as an overall phase of the electromagnetic field .    in the case of the the schrdinger wave function",
    ", the information about the phase @xmath2 of the wave function is stored in the velocity field @xmath19 .",
    "hence , one may try to find the proper definition of the phase of the electromagnetic field by introducing first the counterpart of eq .",
    "( [ velocity0 ] ) and then use the velocity field to reconstruct the phase .",
    "the natural generalization of the definition ( [ velocity0 ] ) is ( in dimensionless form ) @xmath20 however , as has been noticed already by takabayasi in his study of the hydrodynamic formulation of wave mechanics of spinning particles @xcite , this generalization does not work . for a multicomponent field",
    "the velocity defined in this way can not be used to reconstruct the phase because , in general , @xmath21 does not vanish .",
    "even though one can still give a hydrodynamic interpretation of maxwell theory based on the formula ( [ velocity0 ] ) , the simplicity of the scalar case is completely lost @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "the phase of the electromagnetic field and the vortex lines associated with this phase are defined in terms of the square of the riemann - silberstein vector . since @xmath22 is a sum of two electromagnetic invariants , the structure of phase singularities associated with @xmath22 is relativistically invariant .",
    "this definition of the phase turns out to be equivalent ( provided @xmath23 obeys maxwell equations ) to the one used in the classic papers on geometrodynamics @xcite .",
    "despite the fact that @xmath22 does not obey any simple wave equation , the time evolution of the vortices exhibits all the typical features found before by us for the schrdinger equation . during the time evolution governed by maxwell equations",
    "vortex lines are created and annihilated at a point or in pairs and undergo vortex reconnections .",
    "in nonrelativistic wave mechanics the phase of the wave function can be obtained from its modulus provided we also assume that the wave function obeys the schrdinger equation . as a matter of fact it was shown by e. feenberg @xcite that to determine the phase from the modulus it is sufficient that the wave function obeys _ some _ wave equation that leads to conservation of the probability , i.e. to continuity equation .",
    "a similar reasoning applied to the electromagnetic field also enables one to determine the ( properly defined ) phase of this field .",
    "this discovery has been made by rainich @xcite in connection with the problem of the reconstruction of the electromagnetic field from purely geometric quantities in general relativity .",
    "independently , although much later , this problem was solved by wheeler and coworkers @xcite in the context of geometrodynamics .",
    "very briefly , the reconstruction of the electromagnetic field from geometry may be described as follows .",
    "the einstein equations @xmath24 enable one to determine the energy - momentum tensor @xmath25 of the electromagnetic field from the einstein tensor @xmath26 that is made of the metric tensor and its derivatives .",
    "however , the knowledge of the energy - momentum tensor alone is not sufficient to determine completely the electromagnetic field .",
    "this is best seen from the formulas for the components of this tensor expressed in terms of the rs vector :    [ en_mom ] @xmath27    all components of the energy - momentum tensor are invariant under the common change of the phase of all three components of the rs vector  the duality transformation    [ dual_rot ] @xmath28    therefore , the overall phase can not be determined from the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "note , that in contrast to the situation in quantum mechanics , even the global , constant phase of @xmath12 has a direct physical meaning .",
    "it controls the relative contribution to the energy - momentum tensor from the electric and the magnetic parts .",
    "the duality rotations ( [ dual_rot ] ) with a constant value of @xmath29 leave the free maxwell equations unchanged . however , a phase varying in space and/or time would modify the maxwell equations .",
    "that is the reason why the rainich construction works .",
    "namely , he has shown that if one assumes that the electromagnetic field obeys maxwell equations , the phase of the field may be extracted from @xmath25 .",
    "for this purpose he introduced the following four - vector built from the components of the energy - momentum tensor and its derivatives @xmath30 and used the line integral of @xmath31 to reconstruct the phase .",
    "our proposal , how to define the phase of the electromagnetic field is much simpler and yet it turns out to be completely equivalent to the definition given by rainich .",
    "we shall define the phase of the electromagnetic field @xmath32 as half of the phase of the square of the rs vector @xmath33 in full analogy with eq .",
    "( [ velocity0 ] ) of nonrelativistic wave mechanics , we define a `` velocity '' four - vector @xmath34 as @xmath35 since @xmath22 is a complex sum of two electromagnetic invariants @xmath36 @xmath37 is a true relativistic four - vector @xmath38 this vector has the same denominator ( up to a factor of 2 that scales both the numerator and the denominator ) as the vector @xmath31 defined by eq .",
    "( [ velocity2 ] ) since @xmath39 . however , in general , the numerators of vectors @xmath40 and @xmath37 are different .",
    "they do become equal when the electromagnetic field obeys the maxwell equations .",
    "the proof is straightforward but rather tedious and will not be presented here .    in our formulation",
    ", the square of the rs vector plays the role of the wave function @xmath11 .",
    "vortex lines are to be found at the intersection of the @xmath41 and @xmath42 surfaces . as in the case of the schrdinger wave function , at all points where @xmath22 does not vanish",
    ", the vector @xmath37 is _ by construction _ a pure gradient @xmath43 therefore , one may recover the phase of @xmath12 by the following line integral @xmath44 since the rs vector is univalued , the phases obtained by choosing different paths connecting the points @xmath45 and @xmath46 may differ only by a multiple of @xmath47 .",
    "in other words , the vorticity associated with @xmath37 ( or with @xmath40 in the rainich construction ) must be quantized @xmath48 the phase defined by eq .",
    "( [ line ] ) is determined up to a global phase @xmath49 : the value of @xmath32 at the lower limit @xmath46 of the integral .",
    "the value of @xmath49 can not be obtained from the energy - momentum tensor .    under duality rotations ( [ dual_rot ] )",
    "when @xmath29 varies from 0 to @xmath47 , the vector @xmath50 at each spacetime point draws an ellipse in the @xmath51 plane .",
    "the same ellipse is drawn by the vector @xmath52 .",
    "these ellipses become circles on each vortex line since then the vectors @xmath53 and @xmath54 are orthogonal and of equal length .",
    "this property lead berry and dennis @xcite to name the vortex lines associated with the square of a complex vector field the c ( circle ) lines in their general classification scheme of phase singularities .",
    "the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ velocity3 ] ) may be also expressed in the form @xmath55 therefore , the vanishing of @xmath56 at a point also means that the electromagnetic field at this point is pure radiation : the energy density and the poynting vector form a null four - vector .",
    "one may say that on vortex lines the energy of the electromagnetic field moves locally with the speed of light .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the velocity of the energy flow of the electromagnetic field is not correlated with the vector @xmath37 .",
    "even the geometric properties of the poynting vector and the space part of @xmath37 are different .",
    "since @xmath57 is a scalar and @xmath58 is a pseudoscalar , the vector @xmath37 is a pseudovector . in the simplest case of a constant electromagnetic field",
    "the poynting vector is @xmath59 , while the vector @xmath37 vanishes identically .",
    "there does not seem to exist a physical quantity whose flow can be identified with @xmath37 . in this respect",
    "the situation is quite different from nonrelativistic wave mechanics where the gradient of the phase determines the velocity of the probability flow .",
    "the analogy between the phase of wave function and the phase of the electromagnetic field is not exact . unlike the schrdinger wave function",
    ", the electromagnetic field does not have to vanish _ identically _ along the lines where the phase is singular .",
    "it is only necessary that the field is null i.e. the two invariants @xmath57 and @xmath58 vanish .",
    "still , we believe that the lines along which the field is null deserve the name of vortex lines .",
    "the time evolution of the vortex lines embedded in the solutions of the maxwell equations is quite similar to the evolution of such lines embedded in the solutions of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the simplest examples of solutions with vortex lines can again be found among the polynomial functions .",
    "such functions may be viewed as long wavelength expansions and were found to be very useful in the study of vortex solutions of the schrdinger equation @xcite and the helmholtz equation @xcite .",
    "alternatively , these polynomial solutions may be viewed as local approximations to the full solution , valid close to the vortex lines under study . in this case",
    "one may imagine that in the exact solution the polynomial is multiplied by some slowly varying envelope that makes the full solution localized .",
    "we shall give at the end of this section an example of such a solution .",
    "as an illustration of a typical behavior of electromagnetic vortex lines , we present very simple examples of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the following four fields satisfy the maxwell equations and possess the vortex structures very similar to those found in schrdinger wave mechanics @xcite    [ four_solns ] @xmath60    where @xmath61 is a parameter that sets the scale for the vortex configuration . in the first three cases the electromagnetic fields are linear functions of the coordinates and in the last case the field is quadratic . in the first case ,",
    "the two invariants are    [ two_inv ] @xmath62    the equations @xmath63 and @xmath64 describe a sphere centered at the point @xmath65 with the time dependent radius @xmath66 and a moving plane , respectively .",
    "the intersection of these two surfaces is a moving ring shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ring ] .",
    "the radius of the sphere decreases for negative values of @xmath67 until @xmath68 and then starts increasing .",
    "the rate of change of the radius exceeds ( by a factor of @xmath69 ) the speed of light showing once again that various characteristic features of relativistic fields ( like their zeros or maxima ) may travel with superluminal speeds without violating causality . in this simple example",
    ", no change of the topology of vortex line takes place .",
    "however , in the three remaining cases the topology changes according to the same universal patterns as those found in schrdinger wave mechanics .",
    "this universal behaviour of vortex lines is reminiscent of the catastrophe theory @xcite .",
    "the graphical representation of the motion of the vortex lines in all four cases is straightforward since the equations @xmath70 and @xmath42 can be solved analytically giving @xmath45 and @xmath71 for each value of @xmath67 as parametric functions of @xmath72 . in each case",
    "there are two branches that differ by the sign of the square root .",
    "[ four_curves ] @xmath73    the plots of the functions ( b ) and ( d ) show vortex creations and annihilations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lines ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : butterfly ] ) and for the functions ( c ) one obtains vortex reconnections ( fig .",
    "[ fig : reconnect ] ) .",
    "vortex annihilations occur at @xmath74 and vortex creations occur at @xmath75 .",
    "note that according to the formulas ( [ lines ] ) and ( [ butterfly ] ) , at these moments the vortex velocity @xmath76 becomes infinite .",
    "it is also possible to construct localized , finite energy solutions of maxwell equation with vortices .",
    "we shall give just one simple example of such a solution constructed from the following localized solution of the wave equation @xmath77 with each vector solution of the wave equation one may associate a solution of maxwell equations treating the solution of the wave equation as a complex counterpart of the hertz potential .",
    "namely , one may check the rs vector @xmath78 constructed according to the following prescription @xcite @xmath79\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] indeed satisfies the maxwell equations .",
    "the square of the vector @xmath23 has the form @xmath80 since the numerator does not contain the variable @xmath72 , the vortex lines embedded in this localized solution are straight lines parallel to the @xmath72 axis .",
    "two pairs of such lines are created at @xmath81 at the points @xmath82 in the @xmath83 plane .",
    "the four vortex lines move ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fourvort ] ) until they annihilate in pairs at @xmath84 at the points @xmath85 .",
    "the speed of each vortex line at the moment of creation and annihilation is _ infinite _ , showing very vividly that also for localized solutions of maxwell equations the motion of vortex lines may be superluminal without any limitations .",
    "arbitrarily high speed of vortex lines associated with solutions of the relativistic scalar wave equation has already been noted in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "suddenly appear as a straight line and then separate and fly away .",
    "the same solution for negative times would show a reversed process : the convergence of two vortex line and their annihilation at @xmath86.,width=302 ]     are mutually perpendicular and nonintersecting . at the time @xmath87 the vortex lines cross and undergo a reconnection.,width=302 ]     suddenly appear along a parabola in the @xmath88 plane ( shown as a line in the first frame ) that first opens up very fast into two symmetric wings that later slowly separate.,width=302 ]     plane of two pairs of straight vortex lines parallel to the @xmath72 axis .",

    "solutions of maxwell equations exhibiting vortex structures may also be obtained with the use of standard building blocks  the monochromatic plane waves .",
    "a single plane wave is described by a null field since both invariants vanish .",
    "therefore , the velocity ( [ velocity3 ] ) vanishes  a single plane wave has no vortex structure .",
    "also , the sum of two plane waves does not have any vortex structure ; even though it has a nonvanishing velocity field .",
    "however , for three plane waves we may have various kinds of vortex structures . as an example , we choose three circularly polarized monochromatic waves of the same frequency , handedness , and amplitude , moving in three mutually orthogonal directions .",
    "the rs vector in this case ( up to a constant amplitude ) has the form    @xmath89    where @xmath90 , and @xmath91 are three orthogonal unit vectors , the coordinates are measured in units of the inverse wave vector and time is measured in units of inverse angular frequency .",
    "the square of this vector vanishes at the points satisfying the equation @xmath92 it is convenient to chose the coordinate system in such a way that the three basis vectors have the form @xmath93 because then all the vortex lines are parallel to the @xmath72 axis .",
    "the position of the vortex lines in the @xmath83 plane is determined by eq .",
    "( [ 3waves_eq ] ) . for the choice ( [ vectors ] ) of unit vectors this equation has the form ( apart from an overall phase - factor @xmath94 ) @xmath95 the solutions of this equation are @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are arbitrary integers .",
    "the lattice of vortex lines is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : grid ] .",
    "this example shows that vortex lines associated with the phase of the rs vector do not necessarily move ; they can also be stationary .",
    "when one of the polarizations of the three waves , say the last one in eq .",
    "( [ 3waves ] ) , is opposite , the position of vortex lines is determined by a time - dependent equation @xmath99 in this case it is convenient to choose the orthonormal unit vectors in the form @xmath100 the position of vortex lines in the @xmath83 plane is determined by the equation @xmath101 thus , in this case the lattice of vortex lines is not stationary but it is moving as a whole with the speed of @xmath102 in the @xmath45 direction .    the most interesting case , of course , is a superposition not of a few but of a continuum of plane waves , forming a collimated beam . we shall concentrate on the laguerre - gaussian beams , in view of their applicability to realistic situations ( cf .",
    ", for example @xcite ) .",
    "we use the representation of these beams in the vector theory as in refs.@xcite but we combine the electric and the magnetic field vectors into the complex rs vector ( [ rs ] ) . this vector for laguerre - gaussian beams of circular polarization can be written in the form @xmath103 the square of the this vector is equal to @xmath104 note , that the vector @xmath12 given by eq .",
    "( [ lg ] ) is not just the analytic signal but the full rs vector as defined by eq .",
    "( [ rs ] ) whose real part is the electric field and the imaginary part is the magnetic induction .",

    "the functions @xmath114 describe the beam with the projection of the orbital angular momentum on the propagation axis defined by @xmath97 .",
    "they may be written in the form @xmath115 where the upper sign corresponds to the positive values of @xmath97 .",
    "this leads to the following formula @xmath116 the velocity ( [ velocity1 ] ) can be obtained by differentiating the phase of the function @xmath117 but the expression is quite cumbersome .",
    "however , it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ last ] ) that the function @xmath117 for positive and for negative values of @xmath97 carries @xmath118 units of angular momentum in the @xmath72 direction .",
    "vortex lines defined in terms of the rs vector run along the @xmath72 axis and their vorticity has the strength @xmath118 . at first , these results seem to be in disagreement with the detailed analysis of angular momentum of laguerre - gauss beams by allen , padget , and babiker given in ref .",
    "@xcite since they have shown that the additional unit of angular momentum is to be added to @xmath97 or subtracted from @xmath97 depending on the ( right or left ) _ polarization _ of the beam .",
    "however , we have broken this symmetry by considering the rs vector @xmath12 and not its complex conjugate .",
    "this ( arbitrary ) choice has fixed the ( positive ) sign of the polarization . with this proviso",
    ", our definition of vortex lines in terms of the rs vector leads to the same results as the analysis of angular momentum .",
    "each component @xmath119 has only one vortex line associated with the total angular momentum .",
    "however , superpositions of several @xmath119 components , depending on their composition , may have additional vortex lines .",
    "the presence of vortex lines in laguerre - gaussian beams is due to the definite angular momentum in the direction of propagation .",
    "the same vortex lines appear also in electromagnetic multipole fields . in this case",
    "the rs vector can be written in the form @xcite @xmath120 for the dipole field ( @xmath121 )    @xmath122    thus , the dipole field for @xmath123 exhibits one vortex line along the @xmath72-axis ( the direction of the angular momentum quantization ) with unit vorticity .",
    "higher multipoles will exhibit vortex lines carrying more units of vorticity , depending on the value of the @xmath72 component of the angular momentum .",
    "the study presented in this paper fully unifies the description of vortex lines in electromagnetism and in schrdinger wave mechanics . in both cases there",
    "is a single complex function of space and time whose phase generically has singularities along one - dimensional curves in three - dimensional space  the vortex lines .",
    "the velocity four - vector @xmath37 associated with the phase of the electromagnetic field plays the same role as the velocity @xmath9 of the probability fluid in wave mechanics .",
    "the circulation around each vortex line is quantized in units of @xmath47 .",
    "there are two important differences .",
    "first , the gradient of the electromagnetic phase does not have any obvious dynamical interpretation .",
    "second , the electromagnetic field does not vanish identically on vortex lines but only the two relativistic invariants vanish and the energy - momentum becomes locally a null four - vector .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that in principle one should be able to construct a hydrodynamic form of electrodynamics , analogous to the madelung formulation of wave mechanics .",
    "the set of hydrodynamic variables for the electromagnetic field would comprise the components of the energy - momentum tensor ( only five of them are independent , cf .",
    ", for example @xcite ) and the velocity vector @xmath37 that carries the information about the phase of the rs vector .",
    "the quantization condition ( [ circle ] ) effectively reduces the information contained in @xmath37 to just one scalar function giving finally six independent functions .",
    "however , we have not found a _",
    "simple _ set of equations for these hydrodynamic - like variables that would be equivalent to maxwell theory .",
