    "the phase - coherence of an electron s wave function in mesoscopic systems enables one to observe a wide variety of interesting phenomena in quantum physics .",
    "one of them is the phase shift experienced by electrons due to scattering centers .",
    "although the phase can not be measured directly in bulk systems , mesoscopic systems provide an opportunity to attain such information . recently the transmission phase shift experienced by electrons passing through a quantum dot",
    "was measured using the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) interferometers @xcite .",
    "in addition to the direct observation of the phase , phase - coherence leads to such phenomena as the magnetic and electrostatic ab effects , fano interference , persistent currents , universal conductance fluctuations , etc .",
    "quantum dots provide a unique opportunity to study nonequilibrium many - body effects due to the strong coulomb interaction and quantization of energy levels , spin , and charge .",
    "a fano resonance was observed@xcite in the conductance in transport through a quantum dot which is connected to two leads .",
    "the opening of direct tunneling between two leads was believed to be the main reason for the observation of the fano interference pattern .",
    "the interference between two current paths , resonant and direct tunneling , leads to the asymmetrical fano resonance in the differential conductance .",
    "however , the nature of the direct tunneling path is not clear and the direct tunneling can not be controlled in this work@xcite . inserting a quantum dot in an ab interferometer ,",
    "the fano shape in the @xmath1 curves was also observed@xcite .",
    "free control of the direct tunneling probability is possible using a gate voltage .    in addition",
    ", the asymmetrical shape of a fano resonance has been observed in other nanoscopic systems .",
    "when magnetic adatoms are deposited on a metallic surface , the local electronic density of states ( dos ) on a metallic surface is modified due to the kondo effect occurring at the site of a magnetic adatom . using a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm)@xcite ,",
    "the differential conductance between the stm tip and the metallic surface was observed to be of asymmetrical fano resonance type close to the magnetic adatom at low temperature .",
    "confining electrons to an ellipse@xcite in a quantum corral , the phase coherence of an electron s wave functions was detected by imaging the metallic surface with stm spectroscopy .",
    "when a magnetic adatom was positioned at one of the two foci of the ellipse , the stm experiments showed the coherently reproduced image of the magnetic atom at the other empty focus point .",
    "a fano interference pattern was also observed in the carbon nanotubes@xcite when co ions were deposited on the surface of carbon nanotubes .",
    "the ability to observe the fano resonance shape in all these experiments depends on the phase coherence of an electron s wave functions propagating along a metallic surface .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a phase - coherent aharonov - bohm interferometer with an embedded quantum dot ( see fig .",
    "[ fanodot ] ) and study theoretically the thermoelectric effects of this system @xcite when the embedded quantum dot lies in the kondo regime .",
    "the quantum dot in the kondo regime@xcite will be called a kondo dot . though the issue of the transmission phase in this system is a very interesting subject , we focus on the effects of phase - coherence on the transport coefficients .",
    "the phase - coherence enables us to study the effects of the aharonov - bohm oscillations as well as the fano interference on the thermoelectric properties of the model system .",
    "we use the nonequilibrium keldysh green s function method and the noncrossing approximation for our model study .",
    "there are two possible paths for the flow of electrons in our ab interferometer .",
    "the direct tunneling amplitude between two leads is a temperature - independent constant , while the tunneling through the kondo dot is strongly temperature dependent due to the kondo effect .",
    "different physics is expected above and below the kondo temperature ( @xmath0 ) , due to the crossover behavior in the kondo dot as a function of temperature . since the flow of electrons through a quantum dot",
    "is blocked by the strong repulsive coulomb interaction ( coulomb blockade ) at high temperatures above @xmath0 , practically no fano interference arises and the ab oscillations are very _ weak _ in transport coefficients . with lowering temperature below @xmath0 , the kondo resonance peak in a quantum dot develops close to the fermi level .",
    "this opening of an additional resonant current path leads to the fano interference with the direct tunneling path .",
    "fano interference and ab flux modify the shape of the transmission probability through the system near the fermi level .    out of all the transport coefficients",
    ", thermopower is one of the most sensitive to the shape or the particle - hole asymmetry of the transmission probability and is an appropriate experimental probe to investigate the fano interference and the ab effect .",
    "we find that the sign and magnitude of the thermopower can be modulated by controlling the _ aharonov - bohm phase _ with magnetic fields and the _ tunneling matrices _ with varying gate voltages .",
    "in addition , we find that the kondo correlation enhances the amplitude of ab oscillations in diagonal transport coefficients at low @xmath2 compared to @xmath0 .",
    "since two diagonal transport coefficients , the electric and thermal conductances , are influenced by fano interference and ab flux in the same way , their ratio , the lorenz number , is insensitive to ab flux near the zero temperature and is fixed at the sommerfeld value .",
    "the amplitude of ab oscillations in the thermopower and lorenz number is strong near the kondo temperature . a short paper which presents some of these results appeared elsewhere @xcite .",

    "<S> the sign and magnitude of thermopower can be modulated by the ab flux and the direct tunneling amplitude . </S>",

    "<S> the kondo correlation in the quantum dot also leads to crossover behavior in diagonal transport coefficients as a function of temperature . </S>",
