    "such flows may result , e.g. , from convection and the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ) , both of which play an important role for explosions powered by the heating of matter in the stellar core by neutrinos ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , or from global asymmetries caused by rapid rotation of the core , in particular in the presence of strong magnetic fields @xcite . during its non - steady propagation through the onion - shell like structure of the stellar mantle and envelope ,",

    "while the observations provide valuable insights in the properties of the ism , they do not allow for an unambiguous determination of the properties of the explosion . because the mass and energy of the ejecta are not well determined by the observations , it is unknown whether we are dealing with the remnant of an ordinary supernova or a more energetic and possibly also more asymmetric hypernova event @xcite .",

    "these findings show a rather complex structure of the remnant .",

    "this uncertainty limits our ability to , e.g. , setup the initial condition for self - consistent mhd simulations .    because of observational uncertainties , but even more because of the unknown initial conditions and the simplifications in our models",
    ", we do not expect that one particular model perfectly matches the observations .",
    "however , we try to identify simulation results which resemble the observations closest .",
    "we chose a simulation with an explosion based on the sn model 25a by @xcite as the first model we discuss .",
    "the progenitor of this explosion is a star of 25 solar masses exploding in a prolate geometry , releasing a mass of @xmath24 and an energy of @xmath25 .",
    "we approximate the aspherical geometry of the explosion very roughly by a prolate spheroid with an axis ratio of @xmath26 .",
    "we follow the evolution of the simulated remnant till an age of @xmath27 .    during the first @xmath28",
    ", the explosion roughly retains its spheroidal shape although the axis ratio decreases somewhat , i.e. , the ejecta become slightly more spherical .",
    "this evolution , a posteriori , justifies that we assume in our simulations only slightly spheroidal ejecta , because the possibly more pronounced initial asphericity at the onset of the explosion has already decreased during the time it took the shock wave to expand to a size of @xmath29 , when we start our simulations .",
    "the post - shock state consists of tenuous hot gas having a density around @xmath30 and an electron temperature around @xmath31 .",
    "the gas is a strong emitter of mainly x - ray photons .",
    "the total luminosities in the x - ray and uv bands at @xmath32 are @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively . while these values only slightly exceed the luminosities estimated from observations , the emission decreases quickly to a level lower than that derived from observations .",
    "we note here that most of the euv luminosity of the remnant is produced by the nonradiative shocks inside the remnant @xcite .    the spheroidal shape of the ejecta is clearly destroyed when the shock wave hits the closest clouds ( see density maps in fig.[fig : s25a-2d-900a ] ) .",
    "though these are small , they are able to divert the ejecta and shield the regions immediately behind them to a certain degree . on impact , the shock wave heats the surface of the clouds , and the heated rather dense gas starts to emit x - ray radiation .",
    "this can be seen in the emissivity maps in fig.[fig : s25a-2d-900a ] .    upon passage of the shock wave ,",
    "the ionic component of the gas is heated to very high temperatures , but the gas starts to radiate only after the electrons have been heated up to roughly the ion temperature by collisions .",
    "since the frequency of collisions increases with density , equilibration occurs fastest in the densest parts of the snr .",
    "the central regions of the snr possess a very low density , and though the density is considerably higher right behind the shock wave , it is still low compared to that of the clouds",
    ". consequently , once hit by the shock , the combination of high ( electron ) temperatures and densities makes the clouds prominent sources of radiation .",
    "thus , the radiation emitted by the snr depends very strongly on the properties of the clouds .",
    "the radiative energy loss is small , i.e. , the gas remains hot and therefore radiates for a long time .",
    "clouds can remain strong emitters of radiation throughout the entire evolution unless they are dispersed by the impact .",
    "we find a notable disruption only for clouds of very small radius or low density .",
    "clouds above a radius of @xmath35 remain intact , except for some stripping of surface material and some deformations .",
    "the clouds which retain their position , size and shape , act merely as obstacles for the blast wave .",
    "this behavior holds even more for the few massive clouds ` nw ` , ` n ` , ` s ` , and ` se ` , respectively .",
    "neither does the shock wave disrupt any of the clouds nor is it able to modify the substructure of the cloud ` nw ` . because of their high densities , the four large clouds are the strongest emitters of radiation in the snr",
    ".    as the shock wave expands , the density and temperature of the post - shock gas decrease , i.e. , the luminosity decreases .",
    "we show the light curves in several bands in uv and x - ray for model ` s25a ` in fig.[fig : s25a - lc ] . at all times",
    ", the emission is dominated by photon energies around @xmath36 ( green and blue solid lines ) . for this model ,",
    "the x - ray emission between 1 and 7 kev ( dash - dot - dot - dotted black line ) exceeds the emission in the extreme uv band between 80 and 120 ev ( dashed black line ) by a factor @xmath37 throughout most of the evolution .",
    "the x - ray emission exhibits a plateau at a total luminosity @xmath38 before it decreases gradually , while the uv luminosity begins to increase at around @xmath39 , when the blast wave starts to impact the main clouds ( the beginning of the interaction is marked by a vertical line in the figure ) .",
    "the x - ray emission peaks at @xmath40 , possibly facilitating detection of the snr in x - rays . at @xmath41",
    "the shock - cloud interaction is in full swing , and the clouds are being hit by the ejecta ( cf .",
    "the positions of the tracer particles in the _ top right panel _ of fig.[fig : s25a-2d-900a ] ) . at this point ,",
    "the flow geometry is already quite complex , leading to mixing in the gas . in both bands",
    ", several single bright spots can be identified that coincide with the clouds . in particular , we find a strong brightening of the nw limb of the snr ( see the _ middle and bottom _ panels of fig.[fig : s25a-2d-900a ] ) .",
    "these bright spots are the most prominent elements of a network of filamentary emission , similarly to what is observed , e.g. , by @xcite . comparing the emissivity maps at @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    ", we find that the uv and the x - ray emission start to fade after the shock has ceased to heat the surfaces of the clouds ; in particular the inter - cloud medium is emitting only very weakly in the uv at @xmath44 .",
    "a tentative comparison of the luminosities obtained in the simulations with those estimated on current observations shows that the emission of our models is roughly compatible with the observed values , though it might be on the high end of the observationally allowed range .",
    "note , that we do not consider any influence of the foreground absorption on the luminosities derived by simulations .",
    "the complex flow patterns developing due to the interaction between the shock and the clouds facilitate mixing of elements within the ejecta .",
    "this is reflected in both the spatial distribution of the elements given by the tracer particles , and in the velocity spectra of different elements .",
    "we show the evolution of the velocity spectrum of the oxygen ejected in the explosion in fig.[fig : s25a - histo ] .",
    "the total oxygen mass amounts to @xmath45 , of which @xmath46 are in the outflow component . during early epochs",
    "the latter material has a significantly higher velocity ( @xmath47 ) than the oxygen in the spherical component ( @xmath48 ) . during the expansion of the blast wave , and most notably when the explosion interacts with the clouds , the ejecta are gradually slowing down .",
    "this affects the outflow component more than the spherical component . by @xmath49 ,",
    "the velocity difference between the two components has reduced from an initial factor of @xmath50 to a factor slightly above unity ( cf .",

    "both populations are characterised by fingers protruding between the heavier clouds .",
    "the evolution of the distributions of nickel and titanium , which we place in the initial model only in the outflow component , is very similar to that of the outflow component of oxygen .",
    "we note that the braking and broadening of the ti distribution is more pronounced than that of the ni distribution .",

    "for these parameters , the expansion of the shock wave and the mixing of the tracer particles proceeds very much like in the reference model , hitting the large four clouds at the same time .",
    "this similarity can be attributed to the fact that the ratio between explosion energy and mass is the same in both models .",

    "this would correspond to an explosion date around the @xmath65 century .",
    "these events are delayed by another @xmath66 when we decrease the explosion energy in model ` s25bb ` .",
    "while the dynamics is similar , the light curves of the model ( fig.[fig : s25b - lc ] ) shows interesting differences to the reference model .",
    "the luminosity is , in general , lower and softer , i.e. , stronger in the uv than in the x - ray band .",
    "the interaction between shock and clouds does not increase the emission .",
    "instead , it gives rise to a long plateau phase of constant emission after @xmath67 , during which the uv and x - ray luminosities are around @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the high total luminosity and in particular the hardness of the emission appears to be a feature distinguishing particularly strong explosions from sne of a lower energy .",
    "a consequence of the lower explosion energy is the lower expansion velocity of the fluid elements ( see fig.[fig : s25b - lc ] ) , which is reflected in the velocity spectrum of the tracer particles .",
    "furthermore , we find less mixing of particles from the outflow population into the spherical one , mainly because the spherical population of particles remains more concentrated in the central parts of the snr , with less particles escaping between the clouds close to the centre of the explosion .",
    "we compare the x - ray emission at the outer rim at the time when the shock hits the ` nw ` cloud of this model to the reference model in fig.[fig : s25a - detail ] . the overall luminosity is higher for the model with the stronger explosion , but",
    "the most striking difference is the lower amount of substructure for lower explosion energies .",
    "all other parameters equal , a higher explosion energy leads to more efficient heating of the gas and thus more emission , not only from the surfaces of the clouds , but also from the tenuous gas in the interior regions . besides the differences in appearance",
    ", higher explosion energies also cause a larger shock velocity .",
    "to reach the ` nw ` cloud at the stages shown in fig.[fig : s25a - detail ] , the high - energy - explosion model requires about 600 years , while the shock wave of the lower - explosion - energy one takes @xmath69 years .",
    "we estimate the relative expansion rates , @xmath70 , as the logarithmic time derivative of the radius of the x - ray front along the x - ray - bright ridge around @xmath71 , finding @xmath72 and @xmath73 for high and low explosion energies , respectively . for model `",
    "s25bb ` , the value is the same within the measuring uncertainties .    in the bottom panel of fig.[fig : s25a - detail ] , we compare the estimated rate at which the emission front expands into the direction of the cloud ` nw ` as a function of its distance from the centre of the explosion . for each time step , we detected the radius , @xmath74 of the emission front and then computed the expansion rate , @xmath75 . during the entire evolution , the emission front slows down for bot models . during the interaction of the shock wave with cloud ` nw ` , ` s25a ` has a much higher expansion rate than ` s25b ` . in both models ,",
    "the rate at which the shock wave expands into cloud ` nw ` is lower by about a third w.r.t .",
    "free expansion in a direction without any clouds .    comparing these values to @xmath76 derived by @xcite , our simulations appear to favour an explosion energy closer to the canonical @xmath77 than to hypernova - like energies .",
    "we point out that this is only a shock velocity in the cloud , but not an estimate of the expansion rate of the snr shock wave , which can be much higher .    because taking into account just thermal bremsstrahlung , our analysis is limited to a part of the radiation emitted by the snr only .",
    "although a full treatment including all radiation processes is beyond the scope of this work , we can estimate the impact of our restriction to thermal bremsstrahlung on our results . to this end",
    "we employ a criterion for the most important missing process , non - thermal synchrotron radiation , given by @xcite .",
    "x - ray synchrotron emission requires a shock velocity exceeding 2000km / s .",
    "this condition is fulfilled for the propagation of the shock in the inter - cloud regions , but is violated for the shock of model ` s25b ` hitting cloud ` nw ` , where @xmath78 .",
    "in contrast , in ` s25a ` @xmath79 in that cloud exhibiting considerable fluctuations in time and space . consequently , our models would emit appreciable amounts of synchrotron radiation in the ` nw ` cloud only for a high explosion energy .",

    "we initiated the explosion by placing the ejecta into a small spheroid ( of roughly 1pc size ) at the centre of the computational domain .",
    "the explosion energy was mostly ( 95% ) assumed to be in the form of kinetic energy .",

    "2 .   at @xmath119 , we place a large number of test particles in the ejecta and assign different chemical compositions to them based on their initial positions .",
    "the particles are advected passively with the flow .",
    "the positions of these particles at later times allow us to gain a detailed description of the mixing of different elements in the ejecta caused by the decay of the flow into smaller structures .",
    "we construct time - dependent velocity spectra of oxygen , titanium and nickel that can be compared to observations .",
    "we compute the thermal bremsstrahlung emission from the gas in different electromagnetic bands and construct mock light curves . since the collision time of electrons and ions can be long in the tenuous gas forming the interior of the snr compared to its evolutionary time scales , we have to account for the non - equilibrium ionisation ( nei ) of the gas . adding an equation for the energy of the electron gas to the system of hydrodynamic equations and modelling the coupling of the two species with a simplified ansatz for the collision time @xcite , we compute the electron temperature , which is , in general , different from the temperature of the ions . based on these variables",
    ", we compute the photon emission due to bremsstrahlung in different bands at uv and x - ray energies @xcite .",
    "we also look for correlations between the model parameters and the light curves and spectral properties of the models .",
    "the main results of our simulations can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "the supernova ejecta expanding into the ism hits the four large clouds after a few hundred years . for our reference model , a hypernova - like bipolar explosion with an ejecta mass of @xmath120 and an energy of @xmath121 ,",
    "this happens at roughly @xmath122 .",
    "current observations of the snr vela jr .  indicate that this moment of first interaction between the blast wave and the clouds has occurred already .",
    "though it is difficult to estimate the exact time that has passed since , we can conclude that the current appearance of the snr would be consistent with a very energetic supernova explosion in the @xmath123 century , with an uncertainty of a few hundred years .",
    "the uncertainty of this result is rather large , as can be seen when varying the properties of the explosion and of the snr environment . a lower explosion energy closer to the canonical value of @xmath0 or a higher density of the inter - cloud ism delay the impact of the blast wave on the clouds significantly , and",
    "we would estimate a time of explosion about 2000 years earlier , consistent with the speculations by @xcite .",
    "besides the geometry of the snr , we can estimate the rate at which the x - ray bright front marking the interaction of the blast wave and the clouds expands . the results of our models with a canonical explosion energy are in agreement with the value derived from observations by @xcite , while a higher explosion energy gives rise to a faster expansion .",
    "the emission of the snr models is the result of a series of processes .",
    "gas hit by the blast wave is heated , but at first the rise of the temperatures affects only the ions .",
    "afterwards , collisions transfer energy to the electron gas , gradually establishing equilibrium between the two fluids .",
    "since the collision frequency is highest in dense regions of the snr , in particular the surfaces of the clouds , the electron temperature increases rather inhomogeneously , and , thus , the bremsstrahlung emission from the remnant is correlated very clearly to the presence and properties of the clouds .",
    "typically , the early light curves of the models exhibit a steep decline in all energy bands as the shock wave expands rapidly , leading to cooling of the post - shock matter . once the shock wave starts to interact with the clouds ,",
    "the decline is much slower ; some models even enter a plateau phase of essentially constant luminosity . during this phase , which corresponds most likely to the current observational appearance of rx j0852.0 - 4622",
    ", we estimate luminosities in the uv and x - ray bands between a few @xmath124 and a few @xmath125 , i.e. , of the same order of magnitude as observations suggest .",
    "as noted above , the emission reflect the inhomogeneities of the ism , yielding patchy emissivity maps in which the clouds are connected by filamentary structures , similar to what can be seen in observations .",
    "after the passage of the clouds by the shock wave , the effects of the interaction tend to become less prominent compared to the expansion , and the luminosities decrease again , though slower than in the initial stages .",
    "models with high explosion energies per unit mass of the ejecta tend to produce an emission at the upper bound of luminosities given above ; the same tendency can be observed if we increase the ism density or add a large number of small clouds in the vicinity of the explosion .",
    "the light curves show pronounced differences across the range of photon energies . as the snr expands and the mean temperatures drop , the emission gradually shifts to lower frequencies .",
    "high - energy bands fade away very quickly , while the bands we are most interested in , uv and low - energy x - ray , remain strong during the entire evolution . in most models ,",
    "the x - ray band of 1 - 7 kev is more luminous than the uv band of 80 - 120 ev by a factor of a few .",
    "exceptions from this behaviour can be found for spherical and low - energy explosions , as well as a very dense ism with many clouds .",
    "3 .   using ( passively advected ) tracer particles we follow the evolution of three elements .",
    "based on the results by @xcite , we assume that titanium and nickel are present only in the bipolar outflow , while oxygen is distributed across all angles of the explosion . during the expansion of the ejecta ,",
    "all elements are redistributed to lower velocities .",
    "their velocity spectra broaden considerably when the flow of the post - shock matter past the clouds decays by instabilities into small scale structures , and particles are trapped inside the snr at low velocities .",
    "based on the evolution of the velocity spectra , we can distinguish a spherical explosion from a bipolar one : the latter exhibits a broader spectrum and shows nickel at much higher velocities .",
    "the main caveat for a comparison of our models with observations is our limited modelling of the radiation processes .",
    "the observations of the vela jr .  snr show large contributions due to non - thermal processes and thermal line emission , which we currently do not include .",
    "we tried to assess the importance of this shortcoming by applying a criterion for x - ray synchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "we do indeed expect that our models would be strong sources of non - thermal synchrotron radiation .",
    "however , in regions where the shock hits the major clouds , x - ray synchrotron emission seems to be suppressed due to the low shock velocity unless the explosion was very energetic .",
    "the main difficulty in identifying a possible progenitor star is that most of the observational properties of the snr are affected by the characteristics of the ism , in particular by the distribution of clumps and clouds , and by foreground absorption .",
    "the initial conditions of the explosion are washed out to a high degree during the interaction of the shock wave with the ism .    based on our results",
    ", we conclude that the current appearance of the vela jr .",
    "snr is compatible with most of our simulations .",
    "though the differences between our models do not allow us to determine the progenitor of the sn with certainty , we can at least point towards the most likely combinations of explosion properties and ages of the snr .",
    "the assumption of a hypernova around the @xmath123 century ( with a considerable uncertainty that may be up to a few hundred years ) and a less energetic explosion a few thousand years ago agree well with the observations .",
    "hence , observations constraining either the explosion energy or the age of the remnant would constrain the other of the two parameters . confronting results of our simulations with additional observations of the vela jr .",
    "snr and of its environment in radio , optical , uv , and x- and gamma - rays can provide valuable information on the snr progenitor type . given the current set of models , observations identifying the thermal contribution of the emission would be most helpful , while the inclusion of non - thermal processes and line emission is the most important requirement for future modelling .",
    "it would also help us to better constrain the expansion rate and the age of the snr , and its distance .",
