    "the secular evolution of multi - planet systems has become a topic of considerable importance for constraining planetary formation theories @xcite .",
    "we investigate the secular evolution of the two giant planets orbiting hd 12661 , a @xmath1 star .",
    "planet hd 12661 b has a semimajor axis of @xmath2au and a moderate eccentricity , and planet hd 12661 c follows a nearly circular orbit about three times further away @xcite .",
    "this system has inspired several dynamical studies .",
    "a brief survey of their results demonstrates the importance of considering the uncertainty in the current orbital configuration .",
    "@xcite considered coplanar edge - on systems and found that the then - current best - fit solution was chaotic , behavior that is likely due to close proximity to the 9:2 mean - motion resonance ( mmr ) .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite found that the system was close to the 11:2 mmr and that the periapses underwent large amplitude libration for the edge - on case , as well as for a broad range of inclinations .",
    "@xcite claimed that aligned configurations were less likely to be chaotic and thus more likely to be stable .",
    "@xcite found the system could be chaotic , but still stable for @xmath3gyr thanks to a secular apsidal lock about an antialigned configuration .",
    "@xcite performed an independent analysis of the @xcite radial velocities to find a better orbital fit that placed the system very near ( and likely in ) the 6:1 mmr that could be stabilized by secular apsidal lock for a broad range of inclinations . despite the different orbital solutions , both @xcite and @xcite found that the periapses were more likely to librate about an antialigned configuration , but that librations about an aligned configuration were also possible , particularly for systems with large inclinations .",
    "however , @xcite reported that aligned and antialigned configurations were nearly equally likely .",
    "subsequently , @xcite published an orbital solution with a ratio of orbital periods approaching 13:2 .",
    "@xcite found that this orbital solution places the system very near the the boundary between librating and circulating modes of secular evolution .",
    "the revised orbital solutions for hd 12661 b & c and the lack of consensus regarding the system s secular evolution both motivate an updated dynamical study .",
    "further , the historical range of orbital configurations illustrates the importance of properly accounting for uncertainties in orbital determinations .",
    "@xcite found that the classical secular theory gave only a crude approximation to the secular evolution due to large eccentricities and the 11:2 mmr .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite caution against using low - order secular theories to model the system s behavior .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite found that either the octupole or high - order laplace - lagrange approximation described the secular evolution of hd 12661 well and that the secular dynamics is not significantly affected by the 5:1 , 11:2 , and 6:1 mmrs .",
    "although we do not expect near - resonant terms to significantly affect the secular evolution , we use direct n - body integrations to account for the full dynamics , including all possible mmrs .",
    "we determine the mode(s ) of secular evolution consistent with observations and the requirement of long - term stability .",
    "our study improves upon previous studies by combining a bayesian analysis of an updated set of radial velocity observations with direct n - body integrations to examine hd 12661 s stability and secular evolution .",
    "we characterize the full range of orbital histories that are consistent with observations and reject solutions that do not exhibit long - term orbital stability .",
    "thus , we can make quantitative statements about the relative probability of different modes of secular evolution .",
    "we reanalyze an updated set of radial velocity observations ( wright et al .  2008 ) assuming that the stellar velocity is the superposition of two keplerian orbit plus noise .",
    "first , we perform a brute force search over parameter space to verify that there are no qualitatively different and comparably likely solutions . working in a bayesian framework",
    ", we generate an ensemble of @xmath4 orbital solutions using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ; @xcite ) .",
    "each state of the markov chain includes the orbital period ( @xmath5 ) , velocity amplitude ( @xmath6 ) , eccentricity ( @xmath7 ) , argument of pericenter measured from the plane of the sky ( @xmath8 ) , and mean anomaly at a given epoch ( @xmath9 ) for each planet .",
    "we use the priors , candidate transition functions , automated step size control , and convergence tests described in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we assume a prior for the velocity `` jitter '' ( @xmath10 ) of @xmath11^{-1}$ ] .    we randomly select subsamples of orbital solutions to be investigated with long - term n - body integrations and consider a range of possible inclinations ( @xmath12 ) and ascending nodes ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we generate each orbit from an isotropic distribution ( i.e. , uniform in @xmath14 and @xmath13 ) and divide the resulting systems into bins based on the relative inclination between the two orbital planes ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the bins are 1 ) @xmath16 ( coplanar ) , 2 ) @xmath17 , 3 ) @xmath18 , 4 ) @xmath19 , 5 ) @xmath20 , 6 ) @xmath21 , and 7 ) @xmath22 .",
    "we integrate 2,000 systems in each of the first four bins and 500 in each of the last three bins .",
    "we can reweight our simulations so as to determine the probability of the different modes of secular evolution for various assumed distributions of relative inclinations . from each set ( @xmath23 ) , we generate the planet mass ( @xmath24 ) and semi - major axis ( @xmath25 ) using a jacobi coordinate system @xcite .",
    "we used the hybrid symplectic integrator of mercury @xcite to integrate each set of initial conditions for at least 1 myr .",
    "based on a smaller series of 10 myr integrations , we found that the vast majority of instabilities are manifest within 1 myr .",
    "we classified systems as `` unstable '' if , for either planet , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 represent the maximum and minimum values of the semimajor axis , @xmath29 is the initial value of the semimajor axis , and @xmath30 .",
    "we discarded each set of initial conditions that was found to be unstable , and analyzed the properties of the remaining `` stable '' systems .",
    "although a small fraction of our `` stable '' systems might exhibit instability if integrated for much longer timescales , our criteria avoids miscategorizing a system exhibiting bounded chaos ( e.g. , @xcite ) as unstable .",
    "we manually verified that the above criteria gives reasonable results and that various choices of @xmath31 $ ] make just a few percent difference in the number of simulations labeled as stable .",
    "the percent of stable systems in our 7 bins are : 1 ) 100% , 2 ) 99.7% , 3 ) 93.3% , 4 ) 16.4% , 5 ) 0.2% , 6 ) 16.7% , and 7 ) 98.6% .",
    "we independently affirmed the trend exhibited by these stability percentages by performing a smaller , additional set of simulations by using an ensemble of initial conditions generated from a different mcmc code that accounted for planet - planet interactions with a hermite integrator .",
    "several previous studies of hd 12661 ( e.g. @xcite ) and other planetary systems @xcite have highlighted the importance of the apsidal angle ( @xmath32 ) , which is useful for describing the secular dynamics of systems with small relative inclinations .",
    "since we consider systems with a wide range of relative inclinations , we instead focus on @xmath33 , the angle between the periastron directions projected onto the invariable plane .",
    "typically , the apsidal angle is classified as circulating , librating about @xmath34 , or librating about @xmath35 . by inspecting plots of apsidal angle evolution for individual systems , we find that some systems spend most of the time librating about one center , but occasionally the apsidal angle circulates for a short period of time .",
    "therefore , we consider two summary statistics describing the secular evolution : the root mean square ( rms ) of @xmath33 and the mean absolute deviation ( mad ) of @xmath33 about the libration center , where the `` libration center '' is defined as the angle about which the rms @xmath33 is minimized . for a system undergoing small amplitude libration about either center , the mad and rms deviation are of order the libration amplitude . for a system undergoing uniform circulation , the mad approaches 90@xmath36 and the rms deviation approaches 103.92@xmath36 .",
    "these statistics can be used to identify the mode of secular evolution in clear cut cases and provide a quantitative measure that is well - defined even for systems with complex evolution .",
    "we calculate both measures using orbital elements measured every @xmath37 yr . although the libration amplitude ( maximum absolute deviation of @xmath33 ) can be sensitive to the frequency of sampling and leads to ambiguities , both rms @xmath33 and mad @xmath33 are more robust statistics that allows us to describe the secular evolution with a simple quantitative measure , regardless of whether the system is librating , circulating , or switching between regimes due to short - term perturbations .",
    "this robustness is particularly important for studying systems where there is little distinction between the librating and circulating regimes , due to one planet s orbit periodically becoming nearly circular .    for each n - body integration , we determine the libration center and calculate both the rms and mad of @xmath33 about that center .",
    "we discover that the rms @xmath33 ranges from @xmath38 and mad @xmath33 ranges from @xmath39 , depending on the relative inclination ( see table [ tablib ] ) .",
    "the libration centers are preferentially anti - aligned for prograde , nearly - coplanar systems , and transition to almost entirely aligned for near - coplanar retrograde systems .",
    "the stability is highly dependent on initial relative inclination ; very few highly inclined retrograde systems were stable , indicating that non - secular perturbations influence the long - term dynamics for some relative inclinations . although large values of rms @xmath33 and mad @xmath33 may be consistent with non - uniform circulation , visual spot checks of individual systems all suggest libration .",
    "if a system of two planets on nearly circular orbits is excited impulsively , then the secular evolution will follow the boundary between the circulating and librating regimes and cause one orbit to repeatedly return to a nearly circular orbit @xcite . in some systems",
    ", this secular evolution can be used to constrain the system s formation @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the @xcite orbital solution implies the eccentricity of hd 12661 c comes particularly close to zero , as parameterized by their @xmath40 parameter ( eq . 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "because they considered only the published orbital solution in an edge - on , coplanar orientation , they were unable to asses the finding s robustness to uncertainties in the orbital parameters or non - edge - on systems . in order to determine what fraction of stable systems consistent with observations result in one planet returning to a nearly circular orbit",
    ", we calculate four statistics from each of our n - body integrations .",
    "the first two are @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which represent the ratio of the minimum to maximum eccentricity for each planet .",
    "the third ( @xmath43 ) is equal to @xmath44/ ( x_{max } - x_{min } + y_{max } - y_{min})$ ] , as defined by @xcite , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the fourth is @xmath47 , which is a similar measure that includes the eccentricities of both planets in a rotationally symmetric manner that is independent of the systems orientation ( unlike @xmath43 ) .",
    "figure [ figcvsilos ] plots the mean and standard deviation of each measure ( @xmath48 - dots , @xmath49 - triangles , @xmath43 - squares , @xmath50 - crosses ) for coplanar systems which have been binned according to the sine of the inclination of the invariable plane .",
    "the values @xmath48 , @xmath43 and @xmath50 all maintain values @xmath51 for all bins of relative inclination for prograde systems , and @xmath52 for retrograde systems .",
    "the large values of @xmath49 ( triangles ) imply that hd 12661 b maintains a moderately eccentric orbit throughout the planet s evolution .",
    "regardless , the measure @xmath50 demonstrates that the system lies near the boundary of libration and circulation . for the vast majority of systems",
    ", @xmath43 is over one order of magnitude greater than 0.003 ( as found by @xcite ) .",
    "the finding that planet c undergoes large eccentricity oscillations is remarkable since it currently has an eccentricity of only @xmath53 .",
    "we investigate this observation further by plotting the fraction of simulation time that each planet s eccentricity exceeded a given value for the coplanar systems ( fig.[figehisto ] ) .",
    "the dotted vertical lines indicate representative values for the planets initial eccentricities .",
    "hd 12661 c s orbital eccentricity exceeds its current value for approximately 96% of its evolution .",
    "thus , the near - circular orbit we now observe is a rare occurrence .",
    "several previous studies had suggested hd 12661 b & c are in a secular apsidal lock and are undergoing large amplitude librations . however , previously , even the orbital period of hd 12661 c was poorly determined .",
    "now that radial velocity observations span over two orbital periods of hd 12661 c , the current orbital period of planet c is well - constrained .",
    "an exhaustive search for libration of all possible 11:2 , 6:1 , and 13:2 resonant angles found that in only a few percent of all simulations performed , large amplitude libration lasts over several @xmath54 yr .",
    "the current orbital elements of the two giant planets imply that the system lies near the boundary of circulating and librating regimes , regardless of the unknown orbital inclinations .",
    "this behavior causes the eccentricity of planet c to spend most of its time with a significant eccentricity ( @xmath55 ) . by computing the projected apsidal angle on the invariable plane",
    ", we find that the rms @xmath33 ranges from @xmath38 and mad @xmath33 ranges from @xmath56 , for any stable initial relative inclination , and planet c s eccentricity would be greater than its current value @xmath57 of the time .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation is that the eccentricity of hd 12661 b was excited by an impulsive perturbation and planet c s eccentricity is periodically excited via secular perturbations , similar to the history of the @xmath58 and c & d system @xcite .",
    "such an impulse could be the result of planet - planet scattering involving at least one additional planet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the current eccentricity of planet b suggests that the putative scattered planet would have had a mass roughly half that of planet b @xcite .",
    "if the additional planet had been scattered outwards , then there is a significant chance that it would have altered the secular evolution of planet c @xcite .",
    "given the semi - major axis of planet b , it is possible that the scattered planet was accreted onto the star .",
    "if the instability occurred after the star had reached the main sequence , then this instability could contribute to the star s large surface high metalicity .",
    "one potential concern for this mechanism is whether the timescale for the apoastron of the scattered planet to be lowered would be significantly shorter than the @xmath59yr timescale for secular evolution of planets b & c.    there is an alternative interpretation of our results",
    ". one might think that we are unlikely to observe a system at such a rare time , casting doubt upon the orbital fit and thus the inferred secular evolution .",
    "one would expect that one of the 30 currently observed multiple planet systems is transiently passing through such an unusual state .",
    "however , there are several ways in which a system could be `` unusual '' so that the standard caveats of _ a posteriori _ statistics apply . given the current radial velocity observations , there are few alternatives .",
    "we consider it unlikely that our global search missed a qualitatively different pair of orbits due to our assumption of non - interacting keplerian orbits .",
    "more plausibly , one or more undetected planets could be affecting the orbital solution and/or the secular evolution of the system . after accounting for planets b & c , we find no statistically significant periodicities in the current radial velocity observations .",
    "current observations are consistent with a small long - term acceleration , but zero acceleration falls within the 95% credible interval .",
    "further , models with a long - term acceleration do not result in significantly different orbital parameters .",
    "our bayesian analysis assuming two planets and uncorrelated gaussian noise constrains the jitter to be @xmath60 m/s .",
    "further radial velocity observations can test whether a portion of this jitter is due to additional planets .",
