    "we can not asses the accuracy of our absolute wavelength calibration based on them , however , the fact that the two numerical simulations provide the same convective blue - shift suggests the consistency of the approach .",
    "one of the most important steps in the data reduction is the spatial co - alignment of the visible and ir scans .",
    "the aim of this process is to ensure that the scans are not only taken from the same region on the sun but also that each individual pixel of the visible and ir scans come from the same point of the in region .",
    "the correct alignment must be guaranteed for a meaningful analysis of the data , i.e. , for the simultaneous interpretation of both data sets . in order to align the scans we displace and re - scale them allowing for five degrees of freedom .",
    "first , we correct for differences in the spatial scales along the @xmath23 and @xmath24 directions . we define @xmath23 as the direction of scanning and @xmath24 as the direction along the slit .",
    "the step width of the scans was slightly different in both telescopes ( less than 1% ) , and the spatial scales along the slit were computed from the focal length of the telescopes . their ( relative ) agreement with respect to each other were checked using reference images of a sunspot .",
    "then , we found the shift in the @xmath23 and @xmath24 directions by cross - correlation of the visible and ir continuum images .",
    "it corresponds to the offset of 1@xmath0 mentioned above .",
    "finally both slits were not exactly oriented with the same angle with respect to the sun .",
    "there was a small rotation of 1@xmath25 which we also determine by cross - correlation .",
    "once the correspondence between the visible and ir spatial coordinates was set , we interpolate the visible spectra to obtain the spectra at the positions of the pixels in the ir scan .",
    "it is important to have the same spatial resolution in both data sets .",
    "however , the angular resolution of the observations at the vtt was better than at themis due to the use of a correlation tracker @xcite . to solve this problem ,",
    "the ir data were degraded to the resolution of the visible data by convolution with a gaussian .",
    "the contrast of the ir continuum image depends on the angular resolution .",
    "we set the width of the gaussian , and so the angular resolution of the ir map , by comparison with the synthetic images from numerical simulations of magneto - convection @xcite .",
    "specifically , we tune the ir contrast so that the ratio between the visible and the ir contrasts agrees with the ratio obtained from numerical simulations ( 0.48 ) .",
    "such theoretical ratio was found to be almost independent of the angular resolution and in excellent agreement with the value measured by @xcite using a single telescope to obtain simultaneous visible and ir data .",
    "the central panel in figure  [ img ] shows the continuum image in the ir after smearing .",
    "the contrast of the ir image is 0.9% .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ img ] contains the continuum intensity image of the visible data ( contrast 1.9% ) .",
    "the squares point out regions easy to identify in both images showing the goodness of the alignment .    after all data reduction , including smearing of the ir data and fourier filtering of the visible data , the level of noise in polarization for stokes @xmath3 is ( 2 - 3)@xmath26 for the ir data and 5@xmath26 for the visible data .",

    "the longitudinal magnetic flux density or @xmath27 was computed with the magnetograph equation under the weak field approximation using the same method as @xcite .",
    "the magnetograms thus obtained are equivalent to the routine magnetograms ( e.g. , that obtained with the mdi instrument on board of soho ) , if we exclude the velocity fields .",
    "figure  [ virmag ] displays both magnetograms with the same scale of magnetic flux densities . at first sight , both images are similar with the exception that the signals found in visible are larger than the signals found in ir .",
    "indeed , this is the first important difference .",
    "since only the in fields are of interest here , the network region pointed by a circle in the lower left part of our fov was discarded from the analysis by rejecting pixels with flux densities larger than 20  g in the visible and 10  g in the ir .",
    "the noise levels turned out to be 2  g in the visible and 1  g in the ir . the method to estimate",

    "under the same conditions of noise and spatial resolution , the measurements in the visible detect more flux than in the ir .",
    "this suggests that visible and ir lines trace different magnetic structures .",

    ". there are structures having one polarity in the ir magnetogram and the opposite in the visible one .",
    "this effect is evident even in the network area with large polarization signals ( see the circle in fig .  [ virmag ] ) .",
    "such a result can be considered as an additional evidence of the different sensitivity to magnetic fields of the visible and the ir lines .    the magnetic fields in the visible magnetogram ( fig .",
    "[ virmag ] right ) exhibit a preferred polarity while the ir magnetogram ( fig .  [ virmag ] left ) looks well balanced .",

    "yet , @xcite found almost no signed flux using the same ir lines ( they observed 0.2  g ) .",
    "all these results indicate that visible and ir lines may trace different magnetic structures , as conjectured by @xcite .",
    "in order to infer the magnetic field strengths from the observations , we carried out an inversion of the stokes profiles under the misma hypothesis .",
    "micro - structured magnetized atmospheres ( mismas ) were introduced for the first time by @xcite , with the objective of reproducing the asymmetric stokes profiles observed in most solar structures .",

    "we give a description of the procedure followed to invert the data .",
    "we only analyze those stokes @xmath3 profiles clearly above noise . a threshold of three times the noise level was chosen in order to separate clear polarization signals from noisy profiles .",
    "pixels with profiles whose peak polarization is above the threshold in both the ir and the visible data cover 40% of the fov .",
    "this data set includes some 2280 pixels .    following @xcite the stokes @xmath3 profiles in the selected data set were classified using a principal component analysis algorithm ( pca ) .",
    "the aim is twofold . on the one hand",
    ", it reduces the number of representative profiles and , on the other hand , it provides low noise profiles to perform inversions used as initialization for the inversion of individual stokes profiles .",
    "the classification is carried out simultaneously for the visible and the ir stokes @xmath3 profiles .",
    "the profiles of the four lines were scaled to the blue lobe of the  stokes @xmath3 profile .",

    "all profiles with large polarization signals were included in one single class to avoid contaminating the other classes with network profiles .",
    "the stokes @xmath3 threshold was chosen to be 1%@xmath21 in the visible , and this special class includes all profiles from the network patch in the bottom left of our map ( see fig .",
    "[ virmag ] ) .",
    "the large number of classes compared with those obtained for visible lines by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* classes ) or for ir lines by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* classes ) is due to the combination of the different asymmetries found in the stokes @xmath3 profiles of the two pairs of lines .",

    "the misma inversion code is described by @xcite .",
    "we will follow a strategy similar to @xcite . here",
    "we summarize the main characteristics of the underlying model atmospheres :        1 .",
    "there are four different components , one non - magnetic and three magnetic .",
    "note that the inversion of visible lines performed by @xcite require two magnetic components . as @xcite discuss , it is impossible to reproduce even the mildest observed asymmetries with only one component .",
    "here we need one additional component to characterize the weak magnetic field strength revealed by the ir lines @xcite .",
    "the components are embedded in a background producing unpolarized stray light .",
    "the magnetic fields are vertical , along the line of sight .",
    "since the observed stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 signals are rarely above the noise level , it is reasonable to assume the inclination of the magnetic field to be 0@xmath25 or 180@xmath25 .",
    "the inversions were performed only for stokes  @xmath22 and stokes  @xmath3 .",
    "this approach allows us to compute longitudinal magnetic fields , however , the observations are compatible with inclined fields producing a linear polarization hidden by noise ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the implications of this assumption are discussed in @xmath5  [ incl ] .",
    "the temperature of the components is forced to be the same . since the magnetic structures are optically thin the radiative exchange between components is very efficient , washing out temperature differences in seconds .",
    "the four components are in lateral pressure balance .",
    "motions are only allowed along magnetic field lines .",
    "the temperatures are retrieved at four fixed heights in the atmosphere .",
    "the parameters characterizing each component are set at the bottom of the model atmosphere .",
    "they are the magnetic field strength , the occupation fraction , the bulk velocity , and the broadening parameter .",
    "the stratification of these parameters is obtained under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and horizontal pressure balance .",
    "three parameters account for the stray light , and another one parametrizes both the solar macroturbulence and the instrumental broadening due to limited spectral resolution . despite the fact that the spectral resolution in the visible and the ir differ by 30%",
    ", one can use a single macroturbulence for the two wavelength domains because the macroturbulence inferred from the inversions is completely dominated by true solar motions rather than instrumental smearing .",
    "the total number of free parameters amounts to 25 .",
    "they are used to fit some 400 observables ( each wavelength position of the stokes  @xmath22 and  @xmath3 profiles of the four lines ) .",
    "an example of the fit to the intensity profiles is shown in figure  [ clasi ] . the observed profiles ( circles ) exhibit line blends .",
    "these are a telluric line close to the red wing of , a solar fe i line at 15647.3  , and an unidentified possibly telluric line in the red wing of fe  i  @xmath415648   . to avoid the contamination by these blends , the stokes @xmath22 profiles at the wavelengths of the blends",
    "are excluded from the fit .",
    "there are also two oh bands of solar origin close to fe  i  @xmath415652   , however , these bands are only visible in cool solar regions such as sunspots .",
    "the intensity profiles in figure  [ clasi ] are those from class  0 .",
    "all models have three magnetic components . in order to distinguish between them",
    ", we denote them as first , second and third components .",
    "the first component is that carrying the largest mass , as was defined by @xcite , and it is followed by the second and the third .",
    "if the three components would have the same magnetic field strength , the first would be the one producing the largest polarization signal .    figure  [ mod ] displays the model misma of class  0 ( see the stokes @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ clas1 ] ) .",
    "the different physical parameters of the non - magnetic , the first , the second , and the third magnetic components are plotted with solid , dotted , dashed and dot - dashed lines , respectively .",
    "the first magnetic component presents a weak magnetic field strength ( @xmath31100  g at the base of the photosphere ) , while the other two have strong field strengths ( larger than 1  kg ) .",
    "the density of the first magnetic component is the same as for the non - magnetic component ( fig .",
    "[ mod ] bottom - left panel ) whereas the other two components have much lower density .",
    "the reduction is forced by the coupling between field strength and density produced by the lateral pressure equilibrium .",
    "the higher the magnetic field the lower the gas pressure and , for the same temperature , the lower the density .",
    "figures [ clas1 ] and [ clas2 ] show the fits produced by the misma inversion of 12 representative classes .",
    "all kinds of observed profiles are properly reproduced with three magnetic components per resolution element .    from now on , all results correspond to a single height in the atmosphere .",
    "we select the base of the quiet sun photosphere , defined as the height where the total pressure equals to @xmath32  dyn@xmath33 . invoking lateral pressure balance among the individual model mismas ,",
    "this definition sets a single geometrical height for all the inversions , and it corresponds to the height where the continuum optical depth is one in the 1d quiet sun model atmospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the study is focused on two particularly important physical parameters , namely , the magnetic field strength and the occupation fraction .",
    "the latter corresponds to a volume filling factor .    the magnetic field strength inferred from the misma inversion of each class is also given in figures  [ clas1 ] and [ clas2 ] .",
    "the magnetic field of the components are denoted as b@xmath11 , b@xmath10 and b@xmath34 , in order of decreasing mass .",
    "very often the inversions require one component with a sub - kg field strength and two with strong kg fields .",
    "such a behavior is typical of the most abundant classes ( e.g. , classes 0 , 1 , 4 ) .",
    "the fe  i  @xmath415648    stokes @xmath3 profiles of these classes are similar to that expected from the synthesis by @xcite .",
    "the lobes of the profiles have a splitting equivalent to that produced by a weak field , however , they exhibit extended wings characteristic of strong fields .",

    "three quarters of the total observed flux and 90% of the magnetic energy is in the kg fields , despite they represent only 30% of the total filling factor .",
    "there is an accumulation of field strength between 1600 and 1800 g. it may be due to the combined effect of a magnetic intensification mechanism plus the existence of an upper limit that the magnetic field strength can not exceed .",
    "this limit of 1800  g corresponds to a magnetic pressure equal to the gas pressure of the non - magnetic plasma at the base of the photosphere .",

    "when we average over the fov , the _ signed _ magnetic flux does not cancel completely .",

    "@xcite already observed the preference of the strong fields towards one polarity , and figure  [ pdf2 ] shows a clear observational evidence of such an effect .",
    "some of the properties of the observational material used in the work , and the assumptions of the inversion , are not ideal but dictated by feasibility . in order to strengthen the validity of the results",
    ", we devote this section to analyze the assumptions and results that may be more critical .      our visible and ir spectra average the in properties in spatial scales of 15 arcsec and temporal scales of 30  sec (   [ obs ] ) .",
    "the time lag between visible and ir spectra would be of concern only if this spatio - temporal average changes significantly during 1  min .",
    "fortunately , large changes of the average properties are not expected for a number of reasons .",
    "first , the integration time of the individual measurements smears out the short time - scale variations of the in fields , and only variations in the range between 30 sec and 1 min are of concern .",
    "second , low spatial resolution observations of in magnetic fields show how many structures remain stable for tens of minutes , and longer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "obviously , our time lag does not represent a problem for these structures . in view of the results coming from high resolution observations and numerical simulations of magneto - convection ,",
    "this time stability can not not be interpreted as the stability of individual magnetic structures but the stability of the average properties .",
    "for example , a strong granular downdraft lives longer than the granules and , during its lifetime , it continuously advects magnetized plasma towards a specific point of the solar surface @xcite",
    ". observed with low resolution , one would detect a magnetic patch that remains in place for a long period of time , despite the fact that it is formed by many small - scale short - lived magnetic structures that are continuously advected and engulfed by the downdraft .",
    "finally , for the average magnetic properties to present significant variations during the time lag , the typical velocities of the magnetized plasma would have to be unphysically high .",
    "consider the horizontal velocities required to sweep out during the time lag all magnetic elements existing in a resolution element . in this case",
    "the magnetic structures in the same resolution element of the visible and ir maps will be completely different , questioning any interpretation based on their simultaneity .",
    "the required velocities would have to be of the order of the speed needed to cross a resolution element during the time lag , i.e. , 18  km  s@xmath19 .",
    "such speed is too high to be common .",
    "it is supersonic , and much larger than the observed vertical velocities .",
    "obviously , the lack of simultaneity becomes more problematic as the spatio - temporal resolution of the observation improves .    from our point of view",
    ", the spatial and temporal integration of the measurements represents a problem more serious than the time lag and the small spatial resolution differences that may remain between the ir and the visible data sets , .",
    "the polarization detected in each resolution element results from adding up contributions from many magnetic structures having very different properties .",
    "our inversions provide only a crude representation of what may be happening in the real sun .",
    "this problem , however , is not specific of our work but affects all previous observational works on the in magnetic fields . in the case of the misma inversions",
    "the problem is ameliorated because a sketchy model misma actually represents many different underlying atmospheres , including very complex ones .",
    "all those atmospheres having the same average properties produce the same spectrum , and these average properties are the ones that the inversions retrieve ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "the inversions were carried out under the assumption of longitudinal magnetic fields , which minimizes the number of free parameters and simplifies the inversions .",
    "this assumption , however , biases the inferred pdf(@xmath35 ) .",
    "fortunately , the importance of the bias can be estimated and it turns out to be small . if a magnetic field has an inclination @xmath49 with respect to our vertical line - of - sight , the stokes @xmath3 spectrum remains approximately as in the case of vertical field but scaled with the factor @xmath50 .",
    "this is a general property of the radiative transfer equation , and is not restricted to weak fields on plane - parallel atmospheres ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . consequently ,",
    "if an observed stokes @xmath3 profile is reproduced with the wrong inclination , all the parameters of the inversion would remain the same except for the occupation fraction @xmath51 .",
    "the occupation fraction provides a global scaling factor for the stokes @xmath3 profiles , and so it absorbs the full bias .",
    "our pdf(@xmath35 ) is biased because it is based on occupation fractions underestimated by a factor @xmath52 , @xmath53 with the subscript @xmath54 denoting one of the @xmath55 pixels with a field strength @xmath35 , and the symbol @xmath56 standing for a normalization constant .",
    "obviously , @xmath57 sets a lower limit to the true @xmath58 , @xmath59 since @xmath60 . on the other hand , it is possible to set an upper limit by estimating the maximum inclination allowed by the noise in stokes @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "following , @xcite , we synthesize the linear polarization produced by our model atmospheres when the magnetic field of the three components is inclined . for each model misma",
    "we determine the largest inclination @xmath61 producing undetectable linear polarization , i.e. , below the observational noise .",
    "if we use this inclination to correct the occupation fractions , one can define a new @xmath62 which represents an upper limit to the true @xmath63 , @xmath64 where the inequality follows from the fact that @xmath65 for all @xmath54 .",
    "we find that the unsigned flux corresponding to @xmath62 is only 25% larger than the flux of @xmath57 , indicating that the assumption of vertical fields have a very limited effect on the pdf estimated in the paper .      due to the similarity between the magnetic field strengths of the second and the third magnetic components , one may wonder whether they are really needed to reproduce the line shapes .",
    "moreover , if they are not needed , the existence of mixed polarities may be an artifact since the signals of the two components cancel our producing no observable residual . as we stress in   [ minv ]",
    ", the three components are needed . here",
    "we elaborate on the reasons . reproducing the stokes @xmath3 asymmetries of the visible lines",
    "requires two magnetic components , even for the mildest asymmetries characteristic of the network .",
    "one single magnetic component produces stokes @xmath3 area and the peak asymmetries of the same magnitude , in contradiction with the observations @xcite .",
    "somehow unexpectedly , @xcite find that these two components are enough to explain not only the mildest asymmetries , but the whole range of observations including extreme profiles with an even number of lobes .",
    "these two components have similar kg magnetic field strengths , but very different velocities ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figs . 12 and 14 ) .",
    "the large difference of velocities is demanded by the observed stokes @xmath3 asymmetries , and it is the reason why the inversion code is able to separate them . here",
    "we analyze profiles similar to those reproduced by @xcite and , consequently , a minimum of two magnetic components is needed .",
    "in addition , we also want to reproduce the ir lines which , according to the literature , indicate the existence of weak fields in the quiet sun .",
    "a third weak magnetic field component was needed too .",
    "this argument does not imply that all the observed profiles necessarily require three components .",
    "it implies that the typical cases need three components ( regular  and , with fe  i  @xmath415648    and fe  i  @xmath415652    showing weak fields ) .",
    "it also implies that that typical stokes @xmath3 profiles have enough information to constrain the three components .",
    "finally , it implies that if a single misma scenario is going to be used to reproduce all the asymmetries , it must contain three components .",
    "one of the main conclusions of this work is the co - existence of kg and sub - kg fields in resolution elements of 15 as inferred from the simultaneous inversion of ir and visible stokes profiles .",
    "the use of visible lines to measure kg magnetic field strength has been criticized .",
    "the analysis of extremely noisy stokes  @xmath3 profiles of  and  may induce a bias towards kg ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the stokes @xmath3 profiles from the visible lines are the major tracers of the kg magnetic fields in our inversion .",
    "however , the kg that we infer are not produced by such a bias for a number of reasons .",
    "the classes have much less noise than the individual profiles , and yet the inversion yields as much kg of the individual profiles .",
    "the classes that yield at least one kg magnetic component represent 75% of the total pixels .",
    "they include the two main classes with a s / n larger than 100 .",
    "another 10 classes have s / n larger than 30 , which ensures inversions without the bias pointed out by @xcite .",
    "another way to test the consistency of our results is to invert only the ir lines to see whether it is possible to infer kg fields in the quiet sun without visible lines .",
    "this inversion was performed in the same way as in   [ minv ] but only for fe  i  @xmath415648    and fe  i  @xmath415652    with misma models including only 2 magnetic components ( see more details in * ? ? ?",
    "the result of such analysis was a major magnetic component similar to the first component in figure  [ hmag ] and a second with weak and strong fields .",
    "a field stronger than 1  kg was found in 50% of the inverted pixels ( those with the strongest ir signals ) .",
    "the strong fields were retrieved from the extended wing of the stokes @xmath3 profiles .",
    "figure  [ pdf3 ] gives the pdf obtained from these inversions .",
    "the strong field contribution is not as large as in figure  [ pdf ] , but it still carries most of the magnetic energy and flux .",
    "the presence of fewer strong fields as compared to the full inversions including visible lines is due to the incompleteness of the information given by the ir lines , since most of the contributions from strong fields remains hidden by noise .",
    "the signed flux has a behavior similar to that of the full inversion described in   [ sflux ] .",
    "it is more important for the fields stronger than 1  kg while the weak fields are balanced .",
    "figure  [ pdf3 ] also shows the pdf obtained from the milne - eddington inversion of the ir lines ( the dashed line ; see * ? ? ?",
    "this inversion was performed with a single magnetic component and shows only the weak field component .",
    "a new observational technique was used to study the quiet sun magnetism .",
    "simultaneous visible (  and ) and infrared ( fe  i  @xmath415648    and fe  i  @xmath415652   ) polarimetric observations were analyzed under the assumption of micro - structured magnetized atmosphere ( misma ) .",
    "we generate model mismas able to reproduce all kinds of asymmetries presented in the observed stokes @xmath3 profiles , even when there are clear differences in the asymmetries of the visible and the ir stokes profiles .",
    "the model atmospheres have three magnetic components .",
    "the simultaneous inversion of the visible and ir pairs reveals the co - existence of kg and sub - kg fields in the low photosphere .",
    "we have observed this combination of weak and strong fields in 74% of the pixels under study , which means 30% of the pixels of the fov ( see   [ mags ] ) .",
    "this was already observed by @xcite from the separate inversion of the ir and visible lines , however , this work presents the first evidence of the co - existence of kg and sub - kg fields from a simultaneous inversion of lines in the two spectral ranges . from the three magnetic components , the one having most of the mass includes most of the weak fields .",
    "the two other components tend to show strong kg fields .",
    "the preference of the first component to have the weakest fields is due to the coupling between field strength and plasma density .",
    "the weaker the field the larger the density so that the component of weakest field tends to have the largest mass .",
    "the histogram of field strengths of these minor components ( fig .",
    "[ hmag ] ) looks similar to that obtained by @xcite , while the first component has a distribution similar to that obtained with the analysis of ir lines by @xcite .",
    "this supports the hypothesis of @xcite and @xcite : the study of the quiet sun magnetism with only visible lines or only ir lines biases the resulting field strengths ; the in fields must be studied combining stokes profiles from both spectral ranges .",
    "the inferred magnetic fields occupy 1.5% of the total fov . other observations with better spatial resolution ( 1@xmath0 ;",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) yield a total filling factor of 1% .",
    "we obtain a larger value thanks to the combined use of the information from visible and ir lines , while all previous works used lines from a single spectral range .",
    "the filling factor inferred for the same observations used in this paper by @xcite was only 0.85% .",
    "the difference is due to the different model atmospheres used to reproduce the observations .",
    "while here we use a realistic multicomponent model , @xcite carried out milne - eddington inversions with a single magnetic component .",
    "thus , the filling factors in pixels with mixed polarities ( see   [ mixp ] ) are underestimated .",
    "we have measured an average flux density over the fov of 9.6  g ( those pixels without polarization signals contribute to this average with zero field strength ;   [ mags ] ) .",
    "this flux is similar to that obtained by analysis of visible lines with 1@xmath0 spatial resolution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while it is two times larger than the magnetic flux derived from ir lines @xcite .",
    "albeit our observations have lower resolution ( 15 ) , the use of visible and ir lines reveals more magnetic structures than the use of lines from a single spectral range .",
    "the flux density is also larger than the magnetic flux obtained in   [ magn ] using the magnetograph equation applied to a single line .",
    "a combination of factors explain such bias .",
    "first , we obtained magnetic field strengths larger than the saturation limit of the lines , thus the circular polarization signals are no longer proportional to the magnetic flux and equation  ( [ virm1 ] ) is a lower limit of the real flux .",
    "second , the presence of mixed polarities ( see   [ mixp ] ) produces cancellation of polarization signals and the magnetic flux is underestimated .",
    "third , the lines weaken in strong magnetic concentrations , leading to a well known diminishing of polarization signals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , the visible and ir signals often trace different concentrations coexisting in the resolution element .",
    "then , combined inversions allow us to detect more flux than the inversion of one of the spectral ranges .",
    "the inversion indicates the presence of mixed polarities in at least 20% of the fov (   [ mixp ] ) .",
    "this is the largest fraction of mixed polarities obtained from direct measurements .",
    "the fraction of pixels with mixed magnetic polarities grows as the polarization signals weaken ( fig .",
    "[ mix ] ) .",
    "more than half of the profiles with stokes @xmath3 signal lower than 0.2% of the continuum intensity have mixed polarities .",
    "we have estimated the probability of finding a given magnetic field strength in the quiet sun , i.e. , the probability density function of the magnetic field strength ( pdf ; ",
    "[ spdf ] ) .",
    "it is largest for the weakest fields , however , an extended kg tail goes up to a limit around 1800  g. despite the fact that the kg fields have only 30% of the total filling factor , they carry 75% of the total flux and 90% of the total magnetic energy .",
    "there is a clear imbalance of the magnetic flux towards one polarity .",
    "we measure a signed flux density of @xmath43  g which is mostly due to the strong kg fields (   [ sflux ] ) .",
    "the signed pdf ( fig .  [ pdf2 ] ) shows how the weak fields are well balanced whereas the strong fields have a clear preference for the negative polarity .",
    "this imbalanced flux has the same sign as the surrounding network , as it was already observed by @xcite .",
    "this imbalance is qualitatively similar to those imposed in some mhd simulations of granular convection ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these simulations have an initial unipolar field .",
    "the convection reprocesses this field to yield a continuous pdf with a clear imbalance in the strongest fields .",
    "the misma inversion of the ir profiles alone also gives rise to a pdf with extended kg tail (   [ cons2 ] ) .",
    "such tail does not appear in milne - eddington inversions of the same profiles , which tend to select the component of weakest field in the resolution element .",
    "the magnetic fields studied in this paper fill only 1.5% of the total fov . the unsigned flux density that we measure is only a lower limit of the real flux .",
    "larger fluxes are obtained in observations with better spatial resolution @xcite and , furthermore , measurements based on the hanle effect are compatible with a flux density of 60  g or more @xcite . a large fraction of the magnetic structures remains undetected in zeeman based observations .",
    "based on our biased observations , we have produced a pdf with the distribution of magnetic field strengths . obviously , this is not the real solar pdf .",

    "<S> we measure an unsigned magnetic flux density of 9.6  g considering the full field of view . </S>",
    "<S> half of the pixels present magnetic fields with mixed polarities in the resolution element . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of mixed polarities increases as the polarization weakens . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the probability density function of finding each magnetic field strength . </S>",
    "<S> it has a significant contribution of kg field strengths , which concentrates most of the observed magnetic flux and energy . </S>",
    "<S> this kg contribution has a preferred magnetic polarity , while the polarity of the weak fields is balanced . </S>"
