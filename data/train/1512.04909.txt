    "wetting of solids , such as the spreading of a drop on a surface , is a basic and ubiquitous phenomenon in a wide variety of natural and technological processes . as a consequence",
    ", a large amount of intensive experimental and theoretical research has been published over the two past decades  @xcite . here , we focus on the shape of the footprint of a drop . in general , it is assumed that the sessile drop on a horizontal substrate has a circular footprint  @xcite .",
    "however , this not usually the case , as can be easily seen by just spreading some water over the table . the reasons for having non  circular shapes are primarily due to non - uniform wettability of the substrate or / and contact angle hysteresis  @xcite .",
    "the former effect is usually attributed to variations of physico  chemical properties of the surface coating , such as its energy , which can yield to different contact angles . on the other hand",
    ", the later stands for the range of static contact angles that a circular sessile drop can attain on a substrate with uniform wettability .",
    "however , these effects are usually mixed in the literature into a single one , simply named as contact angle hysteresis  @xcite .    in many cases",
    ", the wetting phenomena are complicated mainly due to this hysteretic behavior of the contact angle . actually , different angles can be observed along the same contact line at rest even if the surface is smooth .",
    "their minimum and maximum are called receding and advancing contact angles , respectively .",
    "thus , bearing in mind this fact , it is not surprising that the evolution of the liquid spreading from an arbitrary initial condition to its final state at rest can actually play a significant role on the final drop shape  @xcite .",
    "non axisymmetric drops can also be obtained from other mechanisms , such as the coalescence of two sessile drops  @xcite .    in this work , we are concerned with the shape of drops that form as a consequence of the breakup of a liquid filament sitting on a horizontal substrate under partial wetting conditions .",
    "we study the main features of these drops , such as footprints , contact angle distribution around their peripheries , and thickness profiles along the longitudinal and transverse directions to the filament .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : exp0 ] we present the experimental part by characterizing the substrate and the liquid to be used , as well as the rupture mechanism of the filament and the resulting droplets . in section  [ sec : form ]",
    "we describe the formalism of the long wave approximation which gives the framework for the static solution to be obtained . as a consequence",
    ", the description is firstly performed under the assumption of small contact angles .",
    "thus , sections  [ sec : lub_cart ] and [ sec : lub_polar ] are devoted to the development of analytical solutions for non  axisymmetric sessile drops , i.e. with non - circular footprints , as well for their comparison with experimental data .",
    "solutions without the restriction of small contact angles are obtained numerically in section  [ sec : num ] , where the navier ",
    "stokes equations are solved to describe the dewetting dynamics of a filament of finite length , which ends up into a single droplet .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : exp1 ] we compare the experimental , theoretical , and numerical results for the footprint of the drop , contact angles and thickness profiles . in section  [ sec : conc ] , we summarize the results and present the concluding remarks .",
    "in order to perform the experiments , we use a substrate that is partially wetted by our working fluid , namely a silicon oil ( polydimethylsiloxane , pdms ) .",
    "the substrate is a microscope slide ( glass ) which is coated with a fluorinated solution ( egc-1700 of 3 m ) by dip coating under controlled speed using a chemat dip coater .",
    "this process ensures that the pdms partially wets the substrate , since the coating lowers the surface energy of the glass .",
    "the surface tension , @xmath0 , and density , @xmath1 , of pdms are measured with a krss k11 tensiometer , while its viscosity , @xmath2 , is measured with a haake vt550 rotating viscometer .",
    "the values of the measured parameters are : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 at temperature @xmath6 , which yield a capillary length @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is gravity .",
    "the wettability of the pdms on the coated glass was characterized first by measuring the static contact angle , @xmath9 , of a single sessile circular drop at rest on a horizontal substrate .",
    "then , we were able to quantify the hysteresis cycle of @xmath9 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hystcycle ] , by using a rame  hart model 250 goniometer . in order to do this , we measure the contact angle when the static state is reached either from a previously advancing or receding contact line .",
    "these scenarios are obtained by injecting or withdrawing liquid into an initially circular sessile drop in a controlled manner through a vertical needle that touches the drop at its apex ( see inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : hystcycle ] ) .",
    "our system allows to vary the drop volume , @xmath10 , by incremental steps @xmath11 .    .",
    "the drop initially spreads on a dry surface ( black filled squares ) with an increasing volume , and then recedes due to liquid withdrawal ( red filled circles ) .",
    "finally , due to liquid injection , it advances on a prewetted surface ( blue hollow circles ) .",
    "the horizontal lines show the maximum and minimum contact angles @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the inset shows the drop profile together with the needle for fluid injection / withdrawal . ]",
    "the goniometer allows to measure @xmath9 by analyzing a side view of the drop with a software based on an axisymmetric drop shape technique called adsa  @xcite which fits the front region of the thickness profile by an arc of a circle and allows to have an independent value of the contact angle at each side of the side view of the drop ( see inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : hystcycle ] ) .",
    "these two values serve as a control of the drop symmetry since the difference between them is less than @xmath14 which is consistent with a circular footprint .",
    "we use the average of both values to determine @xmath9 .",
    "this method allows to construct the complete hysteresis cycle shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hystcycle ] .",
    "note that the first branch of the cycle ( black solid squares in fig .",
    "[ fig : hystcycle ] ) is not coincident with the last one ( blue hollow circles ) for the same volume interval .",
    "this is because the initial spreading stage occurs over a dry surface , while the last one ( after the dewetting stage ) occurs over a surface that has already been pre - wetted the oil ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it is know that the receding stage does not completely remove all the liquid , but leaves behind a nanometric thin film  @xcite .",
    "though the difference between @xmath9 in both branches is small , we always obtain larger angles for the spreading on a dry surface . in summary",
    ", we can characterize the wettability of circular drops by the maximum ( minimum ) value of the advancing ( receding ) contact angles of the hysteresis cycle , namely @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the drops that we analyze in this section are the result of the breakup of a liquid filament placed on the substrate as explained in detail in previous works  @xcite .",
    "we start with a vertical jet of pdms flowing out from a small nozzle at the bottom of a vessel filled with the silicon oil .",
    "the filament is captured from the jet on the substrate by performing suitable rotations of its frame before reaching the final horizontal position .",
    "all these movements take about @xmath17 seconds , which is a very short time interval compared to the time scale of the experiment .",
    "this procedure yields a fluid filament of uniform width , @xmath18 , with parallel and straight contact lines , so that the initial configuration has a constant cross sectional area along its axis .",
    "we calibrate the system by relating the fluid height in the vessel with the jet diameter a given nozzle .",
    "thus , both the jet diameter and the corresponding filament widths ( for a contact angle equal to @xmath12 ) could be varied from @xmath19 to @xmath20 and from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "a typical breakup process of the filament starts at its extremes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : evolfilam ] for one extreme .",
    "initially , the ends are rounded and recede .",
    "then , the receding flow forms a bulge , fig .  [ fig : evolfilam](a)-(g ) , and a neck develops at a certain distance from it , fig .  [ fig : evolfilam](h)-(j ) . finally , this neck breaks up , and the remaining bulge completes its dewetting process by evolving into a sessile drop with non ",
    "circular footprint .",
    "this mechanism repeats itself starting from the new end of the filament , and finally gives place to a series of similar drops . here",
    ", we are interested mainly on the shape of the drop that results from this evolution , and not in the description of the instability itself , which has been thoroughly studied elsewhere  @xcite .    .",
    "( a)(g ) : the initially rounded extreme recedes and forms a bulge . ( h)(j ) : a neck develops at a certain distance from the bulge .",
    "finally , this necks breaks up.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartfootprint ] we show the top and side views of a drop together with the digital curves ( red lines ) obtained by image analysis . the side view in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartfootprint](b ) corresponds to the longitudinal direction ( i.e. along the axis of the original filament , @xmath23axis ) .",
    "unfortunately , the transverse view ( along @xmath24axis ) can not be obtained since it is blocked by similar drops sit along the same line .",
    "the maximum and minimum diameters of the footprint are @xmath25 and @xmath26 , while the maximum thickness is @xmath27 ( all variables in units of @xmath28 ) .",
    "since the drop is clearly non axisymmetric , its volume can not be determined by the adsa method . instead",
    ", the average volume , @xmath29 , of the drops resulting from a given filament can be estimated from the number of drops , the weight of the substrate with the drops , and the liquid volume of the jet that formed the original filament . in our experiment",
    ", we have @xmath30 in units of @xmath31 .",
    "this parameter is not needed for the following analytical modeling , but is necessary to perform the simulations in section  [ sec : num ] .     and @xmath24 directions are @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , the maximum thickness at the drop center is @xmath34 , and the estimated drop volume is @xmath35.,title=\"fig : \" ]    since the standard technique of the goniometer can measure contact angles only on vertical planes along the axes of symmetry , for a drop with non ",
    "circular footprint we must resort to a different technique . here , we use one that is based on the refraction of light by the contact line region  @xcite .",
    "thus , we impinge the drop from above with an he  ne laser beam , normally to the substrate . this beam , which is wider than the footprint , is refracted by the drop free surface and produces an illuminated area on a screen placed at a distance , @xmath36 , below the substrate . for a footprint of arbitrary shape ( non  circular ) , the maximum light deflection angle , @xmath37 , varies at different azimuthal directions , @xmath38 , with @xmath39 .",
    "thus , it is given by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the diameter of the illuminated figure at a certain @xmath38 , which passes through the drop center .",
    "then , the contact angle is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the refraction index of pdms .",
    "this expression assumes that the glass and drop thicknesses , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , are much smaller than the distance to the screen , @xmath46 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : refrac](a ) .",
    "thus , eq .",
    "( [ eq : theta_e ] ) allows to obtain the contact angle of the drop , @xmath47 , around all of its periphery . a typical illumination pattern is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : refrac](b ) , where the central region is blocked with a light stopper to avoid saturation of the camera in order to obtain a good contrast .",
    "the diameter of this stopper , which is actually a coin , also works as a reference of length scale .",
    "interestingly , the contact angles given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : theta_e ] ) in the transverse and longitudinal directions ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 in fig .",
    "[ fig : refrac](b ) ) are very close to maximum ( minimum ) value of the advancing ( receding ) contact angles measured in the hysteresis cycle , namely @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) in fig  [ fig : hystcycle ] .",
    "this is because the drop adopts its final shape by wetting in the transverse direction and dewetting in the longitudinal one .",
    "therefore , these two angles characterize the resulting geometry of the footprint .",
    "we are now concerned with static solutions of the dimensionless navier  stokes ( n - s ) equation , @xmath50   = - \\vec { \\nabla } p + \\nabla ^{2 } \\vec { v } -\\vec{z } , \\label{eq : ns}\\ ] ] where the last term stands for the gravity force . here , the scales for the position @xmath51 , time @xmath52 , velocity @xmath53 and pressure @xmath54 are @xmath28 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the laplace number is @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath24axes are assigned along and across the original filament , respectively .    for a sessile drop at rest , we have @xmath59 , so that the balance between gravity and pressure gradient is given by , @xmath60 plus the boundary condition of capillary pressure jump at the interface : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the drop thickness function , and @xmath63 is the ambient pressure outside the drop .",
    "if follows that the pressure field in the sessile drop is @xmath64 . since the equilibrium condition is @xmath65 , we have @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the ( unknown ) constant pressure inside the drop .    when the drop is axisymmetric , i.e. with circular footprint , the static problem posed by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pcap ] ) and ( [ eq : p_eq ] ) is already solved in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , no similar attempts have been done for the non  axisymmetric problem . here",
    ", we retain the asymmetric features of the drop , but somewhat simplify the equations by assuming the validity of the lubrication theory . within this approach ,",
    "the long wave approximation requires small slopes at the free surface , so that @xmath68 , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_eq ] ) becomes @xmath69 which is the inhomogeneous helmholtz equation .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath70 and given contact angle , @xmath71 , along the contact line .",
    "a solution of this equation can be written in the form @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the solution of the homogeneous equation , @xmath74    our approach in this paper is to compare particular solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_eq1 ] ) with experimental data .",
    "these solutions have been selected as having a special symmetry and requiring the smallest number of parameters from the experiments .",
    "this comparison is performed by verifying that the predicted shape of the contact line , thickness profiles , and contact angles are in agreement with the measurements .",
    "since the experimental data show that the characteristic contact angles , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , correspond to perpendicular axes , we consider the solution as having two axes of symmetry , namely @xmath23 and @xmath24 . therefore , expressing the solution is cartesian coordinates and assuming variable separation , we write @xmath75 .",
    "then , eq .  ( [ eq : ode_h1 ] ) leads to @xmath76 among all possible solutions of this equation , we restrict ourselves to even functions in both @xmath23 and @xmath24 , due to the symmetric character of the drop respect to @xmath23 and @xmath24 reflections .",
    "thus , we find @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a constant , and @xmath79 are determined by the constraint @xmath80 note that , in general , the solution is an integral in terms of @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",
    "however , for simplicity , we assume that a single value of @xmath81 is needed to reasonably describe the solution .",
    "this is in consonance with our aim to determine the detailed properties of the experiments from solutions that comply with only a small subset of the boundary conditions .",
    "this allows us to test the robustness of the solutions obtained from this model .",
    "in general , a boundary condition is @xmath83 at the points @xmath84 of the contour of the footprint ( contact line ) , which means that @xmath85 then , the widths ( or diameters ) of the drop along the @xmath23 and @xmath24-axes , namely @xmath86 and @xmath87 , can be obtained for @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "thus , the solution of the type  ( [ eq : h1a ] ) yields @xmath90 which implies @xmath91 since the contact angles at the axes of symmetry of the drop are given by @xmath92 we obtain the relationship @xmath93    although this equation is obtained within the long wave approximation where small slopes are assumed , we test its range of validity by comparing it with experimental data corresponding to relatively large angles . figure  [ fig : lin_rel ] shows this comparison , where the ratios for drops belongs to two filaments , a and b , of the same length and width . even after taking into account the dispersion of the data",

    ", one could choose the group : @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath94 .",
    "for this case , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp_cart ] the comparison between the theoretical results and the experiment for the shape of the footprint , the longitudinal thickness profile , and the contact angle distribution around the drop periphery .",

    "[ footcartexp ] and [ hxcartexp ] show that the footprint as well as the thickness profile present only very small departures from the experimental data . however , the differences in the azimuthal distribution of contact angles are important at the maximums and we find a much smoother transition regions between the maximum and minimum contact angles ( see fig .",
    "[ angcartexp ] ) , likely because the three parameters used in this solution do not contain sufficient angular information .    on the other hand , another example could be given by using @xmath99 and @xmath100 instead of @xmath86 and @xmath87 as input data ( aside from @xmath94 ) .",
    "now , the results look a bit different due to the inclusion of angular information ( see fig .  [",

    "( [ eq : thetavsw ] ) ( see arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : lin_rel ] ) .    in summary , in spite of this small number of parameters , the predictions are remarkably good for the shape and thickness , while the agreement for the contact angle distribution is less satisfactory .",
    "the fact that this cartesian solution fails to fully describe the azimuthal distribution of the contact angle ( see fig .",
    "[ angcartexp ] ) implies that more information is needed to describe the static free surface .",
    "note that this cartesian model is not completely general since it is limited to only two symmetries , namely respect to the @xmath23 and @xmath24axes .",
    "moreover , it does not fully take into account any harmonic component of the problem , other than angular periodicities multiples of @xmath49 . in order to improve this solution",
    ", we should resort to an integral , which requires a not straightforward procedure .",
    "instead of increasing the complexity of the cartesian model , we show here that polar coordinates are more convenient to deal with other details of the problem .",
    "they allow us to apply the basic angular symmetries of the drop in a very convenient way and reduce the problem to a fourier series instead of an implicit integral equation .",
    "if the problem is expressed in the radial and angular variables @xmath102 , a separation of the form @xmath103 is possible , leading to two uncoupled ordinary differential equations for @xmath104 and @xmath38 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ode_h1 ] ) .",
    "note that since we must assume angular periodicity in @xmath39 , the solution in @xmath38 satisfies a sturm - liouville problem and a fourier series is obtained .",
    "the equation for @xmath73 can be written as @xmath105 where the @xmath38dependence is of the form @xmath106 with @xmath107 a positive integer .",
    "thus , it turns out that @xmath104 is given by the bessel function of order @xmath107 ( neumann functions must be discarded since they diverge at the center of the drop ) .",
    "therefore , the general solution in polar coordinates can be expressed as @xmath108    in order to have a symmetric solution respect to reflections along @xmath23 and @xmath24axes , we must have @xmath109 and odd @xmath107 . here",
    ", we further assume that the shape of the drop can be reasonably estimated by the first five terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hpolar ] ) , so that @xmath110 where the five unknown constants , @xmath111 , must be determined from the experimental data . in fact , by measuring the values of @xmath112 , we can form the following system of independent equations , @xmath113 which can be solved analytically .    the comparison between this solution and experiments is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp_polar ] . similarly to the cartesian solution ,",
    "[ footpolarexp ] and [ hxpolarexp ] show that the footprint as well as the thickness profile given by the polar solution present very little difference with the experimental data .",

    "in fact , fig .",
    "[ angpolarexp ] shows a very good agreement not only by yielding accurate values of the advancing and receding contact angles , but also in the regions nearby these angles . nevertheless , even if the transition zones are steeper than the cartesian solution , they are not still steep enough when compared to the experimental data .",

    "finally , the hysteretic behavior of the contact angle is introduced by ascribing different values of @xmath9 to different regions of the substrate .",
    "thus , we consider that the region originally occupied by the filament ( the rectangular area limited by @xmath130 , and @xmath131 ) has @xmath132 , while for the rest of the substrate it corresponds @xmath133 .",
    "this spatial distribution of @xmath9 assumes that the contact line will only recede in the region where the filament initially sits , and only advances outside of it .",
    "naturally , the step function that this description implies should be slightly smoothed to avoid numerical issues .",
    "moreover , the experiments show that in a region close and outside of the filament contact line both kinds of motion may take place .",
    "therefore , we also consider a wider smooth transition of @xmath9 along @xmath24-direction ( normal to the filament ) within a certain distance @xmath134 , which should be of the order of @xmath18 .",
    "thus , we construct the wettability of the substrate as : @xmath135 where @xmath136- \\tanh \\left [ q_x",

    "\\theta_y & = & \\frac{\\tanh \\left [ q_y ( x+w/2+\\delta/2 ) \\right]- \\tanh \\left [ q_y ( y - w/2-\\delta/2 ) \\right]}{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath137 and @xmath138 set the average slope of the transition region . here , we take @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 .",
    "we use a finite element technique in a domain which deforms with the moving fluid interface by using the arbitrary lagrangian - eulerian ( ale ) formulation . the interface displacement is smoothly propagated throughout the domain mesh using the winslow smoothing algorithm .",
    "the main advantage of this technique compared to others such as the level set of phase field techniques is that the fluid interface is and remains sharp .",
    "the main drawback , on the other hand , is that the mesh connectivity must remain the same , which precludes the modeling of situations for which the topology might change ( rupture of the filament ) .",
    "the default mesh used throughout is unstructured , and typically has @xmath142 triangular elements ( linear elements for both velocity and pressure ) .",
    "automatic remeshing is enabled to allow the solution to proceed even for large domain deformation when the mesh becomes severely distorted .",
    "the mesh nodes are constrained to the plane of the boundary they belong to for all but the free surface .    to simulate the evolution of a short filament that leads to a single drop",
    ", we calculate the filament length , @xmath126 , for a given experimental value of the width , @xmath18 .",
    "this can be easily done by knowing the drop volume , @xmath143 , under study . for the case in fig .",
    "[ fig : evolfilam ] , we have @xmath144 and , with @xmath145 , we find @xmath146 .",
    "assuming @xmath16 and @xmath15 , we obtain the time evolution of the footprint shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : foots ] . in these simulations we use @xmath147 , as given by the experimental parameters , and set @xmath148 .",
    "the runs with smaller values of @xmath125 produced only negligible differences .",
    "at early times , the ends of the filament dewet and a bulge is formed at each end .",
    "so , the side parts of the buldge contact line lie outside the filament footprint : the most external portions of this contact line dewet , while the most internal ones advance towards the center of the filament ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with experimental observations , and justifies the choice of a wide transition region for @xmath100 , which yields intermediate angles in the region close and outside the filament footprint .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : hx_t0 - 200 ] , we plot the thickness profile along the meridian plane ( @xmath150 ) . at early times",
    ", a depression appears at the middle of the filament , but since @xmath126 is relatively short , the behavior of the thickness there changes , and it starts growing for later times , thus building up the central region of the drop",
    ".    for very large times , say @xmath151 , the drop reaches a static shape at rest , and adopts a footprint very close to that in the experiments .",
    "we compare in the following section the numerical results thus obtained with the theoretical solutions within the lubrication approximation as well as the experiments .    in order to validate the numerical simulations , we first compare its results with those of the lubrication approximation solutions .",
    "to do so , we perform calculations with smaller contact angles as those in the experiments , namely one third of the values defined above , i.e. we use here : @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "the comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : small_ang ] ( for the cartesian solution we use @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath94 as input parameters ) .",
    "as expected , very little differences exist among the three curves for the footprints in fig .",
    "[ footgotateor ] , and the longitudinal thickness profiles in fig .",
    "[ hxgotateor ] .",
    "interestingly , the numerical simulations show in fig .  [ anglgotateor ]",
    "a steeper transition between the maximum and minimum contact angles than those given by the long wave solutions ( the small difference of @xmath154 at the maximum of the numerical is probably related to a grid effect ) . therefore , except for these details in the angular distribution , the simulations as posed can be safely used to describe the physical problem in hand .",
    "now , we compare in fig .",
    "[ fig : num - exp ] the numerical solution for large times with the experimental data for the drop with large contact angles . the footprints comparison in fig .",
    "[ footgotaexpynum ] shows that the simulations are able to account for the slight change of curvature sign in the regions connecting the receding and advancing apexes , which is a characteristic feature of this type of drops .",
    "however , the simulation overestimates the value of the @xmath86 in about @xmath155 , and consequently , underestimates @xmath87 in the same amount .",
    "however , this small difference in @xmath86 does not have an important effect on the comparison with the thickness profile , as seen in fig .",
    "[ hxgotaexpynum ] ) .    as regards to the dependence @xmath47 , fig .",
    "[ anglgotaexpynum ] shows that the simulation yields an angular distribution similar to that of the experiments in the sense that both show steep transitions between the maximum ( @xmath156 ) and minimum ( @xmath157 ) , and a relatively wider plateau at the maximum region .",
    "the differences between numerics and experiments at these extremes ( @xmath158 ) are due to numerical errors .",
    "interestingly , the equality of ratios in eq .",
    "( [ eq : thetavsw ] ) is satisfied within an error of @xmath159 , which means that the departure of widths and angles are consistent with this basic property of the solution . in general",
    ", this comparison shows that the form used here to emulate the hysterical behavior of the contact angle is appropriate to study this kind of problems .",
    "[ sec : exp1 ]",
    "in this work we study in detail the morphology of sessile drops with non  circular footprints .",
    "in particular , we focus on the kind of drops that result from the breakup of a liquid filament placed on a horizontal substrate under partial wetting conditions . in order to obtain this type of wetting when the liquid ( silicon oil pdms ) is in contact with the glass substrate , we modify its surface energy by coating it with a fluorinated solution .",
    "the resulting wettability is characterized by a hysteresis curve for the contact angle , so that the advancing and receding angles are known parameters of the system while modeling of the flow . by means of optical techniques ,",
    "we are able to measure the drop footprint , the thickness profile along the filament axis , and the azimuthal distribution of contact angle around the drop periphery .    the shape of a typical static droplet thus obtained is described by using the long wave theory , or lubrication approximation .",
    "two analytical solutions , in cartesian and polar coordinates , are found within this framework .",
    "the main goal of looking for these solutions is to be able to predict details of the drop that are difficult to measure , such as the shape of the footprint , the thickness profiles , and the angular distribution of contact angles .",
    "we determine these solutions by using a minumum number of easily measured parameters , such as maximum or minimum diameters , angles and thicknesses .",
    "the solutions thus obtained are contrasted with detailed experimental measurements to assess their accuracy .",
    "while the cartesian solution is restricted by the choice of at most three ( measurable ) parameters , the polar one is truncated to allow for five of them . in this sense",
    ", we also study four different ways to combine the parameters necessary to fix the polar solution .",
    "interestingly , the cartesian solution provides a simple relationship between the widths of the drop and the contact angles along the axes of symmetry , which holds with good approximation when compared with experimental data . in general",
    ", the good agreement found in the comparison with the experiments confirms that the lubrication approximation solutions are quantitatively suitable to describe the drops with non ",
    "circular footprints .",
    "since the experimental drops have relatively large contact angles , and the theoretical modeling assumes small values of the free surface slopes , there might remain some doubts about the comparison with these experiments .",
    "so , in order to put in evidence possible effects related to the presence of large contact angles , we also compute the drop shape by performing time evolving simulations of the full navier  stokes equation . in these calculations ,",
    "two main features have to be included : a ) the relaxation of the contact line singularity by including a slip model at the boundary condition on the substrate , and b ) the hysteresis of the contact angle .",
    "the latter is emulated by imposing a specific spatial distribution of contact angle as suggested by experimental observations , that is , by setting @xmath13 in the region initially occupied by the filament , and @xmath12 outside of it , with a smoothed and narrow transition region .",
    "the simulations are validated with the theoretical solutions for small contact angles , and are also compared with the experimental data .",
    "the most remarkable result of these simulations is that the effect of having large contact angles is to widen the regions of constant @xmath9 around the minimum ( @xmath157 ) and maximum ( @xmath156 ) values , as well as to make steeper the transitions regions in this angular diagram .",
    "a similar effect is also observed with the polar solution , in better agreement with the experimental data than the cartesian one .",
