    "over the past decades , infrared ( ir ) astronomy made a tremendous progress largely thanks to various space missions , such as the infra - red astronomical satellite ( iras : @xcite ) , the infrared space observatory ( iso ; @xcite ) , and the @xmath1 space telescope @xcite .",
    "the most important aspect carried by ir wavelengths is probably that ir emission represents the dust - obscured star formation activity of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the bolometric ir luminosity of galaxies measures the dust - obscured star formation within galaxies and is less affected by extinction while other shorter wavelength star formation rate ( sfr ) proxies falling on optical and ultra - violet ( uv ) wavelength regimes . however using the bolometric ir luminosity as a star formation ( sf ) indicator has two caveats .",
    "first , not only newly formed massive stars , but also evolved stellar populations can heat dust components within galaxies @xcite . then it is extremely tricky to obtain the whole range of ir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for high - z galaxies to measure bolometric ir luminosities . therefore , many studies have attempted calibrate several ir sfr proxy candidates including 8 @xmath3 and 24 @xmath3 bands to bolometric ir luminosities and other sfr indicators in order to establish reliable ir sfr proxies in recent years .",
    "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) have gotten enormous attention due to their ubiquity and strong potential as diagnostics of other properties such as ionized states and sizes of grains .",
    "pahs are considered to be present in a wide range of objects and environments , such as post - agb stars , planetary nebulae , hii regions , reflection nebulae and the diffuse interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "the pah features are believed to contribute up to 10 % of the total ir luminosity of star forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "numerous recent studies measure pah band fluxes and equivalent widths ( ews ) in order to calibrate these emission features as sfr proxies within the galactic environments and galaxies at higher redshift .",
    "these studies reveal that there exist differences in pah ews and l@xmath7/@xmath8 ratios between local values and high redshift ones @xcite .",
    "since pah band ratios reflect variations in physical conditions within environments , such as ionization states of dust grains and metallicity @xcite , more detailed study on this subject will put a better constraint on physical conditions of pah emission sites and calibration of pah bands as sfr proxies .",
    "these previous studies on pah emission features concentrate on stronger bands , such as 6.2 , 7.7 , and 11.3 @xmath0 . on the other hand , studies on 3.3 @xmath0 feature have been far fewer , due to its relatively weaker strength .",
    "there still have been efforts to investigate the 3.3 @xmath3 pah emission and its property related to star formation activity .",
    "the first of such studies is @xcite . compiling infrared l - band ( 3 - 4 @xmath3 )",
    "spectra from various sources , @xcite categorized the 3.3 @xmath3 pah emission feature into two types and investigated if the origin of the emission feature is pahs .",
    "several studies on energy source of ir emission followed . analyzing 57 agn and one starburst galaxy spectra , @xcite detected the 3.3 @xmath3 pah emission from 47 of them and used its strength for classifying the target spectra .",
    "@xcite detected the 3.3 @xmath3 emission in two seyfert 1 galaxies and one quasi - stellar object ( qso ) using @xmath9 infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) spex and claimed that these active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have the 3.3 @xmath3 pah luminosity levels similar to those of starburst and lirgs . @xcite and @xcite observed 32 seyfert 2 galaxies and 23 seyfert 1 galaxies , respectively , in order to investigate connection between nuclear starburst activity and agn activity using ground - based l - band spectroscopy .",
    "they detected the 3.3 @xmath3 pah emission from 10 out of 23 seyfert 1 galaxies and 11 out of 32 seyfert 2 galaxies respectively , and found that starburst activity correlates with nuclear activity regardless of types of seyfert galaxies . using iso / sws spectra of a wide variety of sources",
    ", @xcite claimed that the 3.3 @xmath3 emission originate mainly in neutral and/or negatively charged pahs in contrast to the 6.2 and 7.7 @xmath3 emission which are from pah cations . on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite confirmed that there is a strong correlation between nuclear starburst activity and agn activity traced by either x - ray luminosity , or nuclear n - band luminosity for seyfert galaxies , while detecting the 3.3 @xmath3 pah emission from three out of eight sources and five out of 22 sources , respectively . extending these works into more luminous regime",
    ", @xcite observed 30 pg qsos and detected the 3.3 @xmath3 pah emission from five qsos utilizing slit - less spectroscopic capability of akari infrared satellite @xcite to probe global star formation activity by the 3.3 @xmath3 pah emission feature .. they confirmed that the correlation between nuclear starburst activity and agn activity are intact for pg qsos .",
    "there have been other studies utilizing slit - less spectroscopic capability of akari .",
    "@xcite obtained akari infrared camera ( irc ; @xcite ) spectra of 45 nearby ulirgs in order to investigate the energy source of ulirgs .",
    "they detected the 3.3 @xmath3 pah emission from 40 ulirgs .",
    "however , they claimed that the obscured starburst activity is not the dominant energy source for these ulirgs , even for ulirgs which are classified as non - seyfert optically .",
    "@xcite also obtained irc spectroscopy of 64 lirgs and 54 ulirgs and detected the 3.3 @xmath3 pah emission from the majority of the observed targets .",
    "they found that the 3.3 @xmath3 pah gives a good estimate for sfr as br@xmath10 ( @xmath11 = 4.05 @xmath3 ) does . for more of higher redshift objects",
    ", @xcite detected the 3.3 @xmath3 pah emission for four out of 11 z @xmath2 2 ulirgs .",
    "understanding how the 3.3 @xmath0 pah emission is related to star formation activities has a great importance , since the 3.3 @xmath0 pah feature is likely to be the only dust emission feature at high redshift ( @xmath12 ) easily accessible with future space ir telescope missions , such as james webb space telescope ( jwst ) and spica .",
    "given the importance of understanding 2.5 - 5 @xmath0 mid - infrared ( mir ) emissions from extragalactic sources , we carried out a study of low redshift objects in the 2.5 - 5 @xmath0 window , akari mjy unbiased survey of extragalactic sources ( amuses ) as one of akari mission projects ( mps ) .",
    "the main scientific goal of amuses is to construct a continuous spectral library over the wavelength window between 2.5 and 40 @xmath0 for a subsample of 5@xmath13 unbiased @xmath1",
    "extragalactic survey ( 5muses , @xcite ) by combining spectra from akari and @xmath1 .    in  [ data ]",
    ", we present sample selection , data acquisition and reduction .",
    "then we present and discuss fitting methodology as well as stacking analysis in  [ analysis ] . in  [ results ] , we present both reduced individual spectra and the stacked spectra of the sample",
    ". we also present and discuss fitting results in  [ results ] .",
    "implication of our results are presented in ",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "we summarize our study in  [ sum ] .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume that the universe is flat with @xmath14= 0.3 and @xmath15=0.7 , and @xmath16=70 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the amuses sample is drawn from 5muses .",
    "we choose 5muses as our parent sample , because it contains a statistically unbiased library of mir spectra of ir sources that covers the gap between the bright , nearby ir galaxies and the much fainter , more distant ir sources being studied by the @xmath18 .",
    "5muses , one of the @xmath1 legacy surveys , performed a mir spectroscopic observation of extragalactic sources brighter than 5@xmath13 at 24@xmath0 in the @xmath1 first look survey ( fls ; @xcite ) field and four subfields of @xmath1 wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire ; @xcite ) with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) onboard the @xmath1 space telescope .",
    "the main scientific goal of 5muses is to provide an unbiased library of infrared spectra from 5 to 40 @xmath0 of sources which have not been sought after in previous studies .    since the main objective of amuses is to detect the 3.3 @xmath0 pah feature , we select 5muses galaxies that are brighter than 1 mjy at 3.6 @xmath0 .",
    "based on the @xmath1 irac 3.6 @xmath0 data for the 5muses sample , we find that 60 of the 330 5muses galaxies satisfy the flux cut of 1mjy at 3.6 @xmath0 .",
    "we limit the redshift range to z @xmath19 0.5 in order to achieve s / n @xmath6 5 for detection of the 3.3 @xmath0 emission feature . with this additional cut ,",
    "the sample size is reduced to 50 galaxies .",
    "in addition to this base sample , we add 10 5muses galaxies with their 3.6 @xmath0 flux brighter than 0.7 mjy whose redshifts could not be determined by optical spectroscopy .",
    "these are added as secondary targets in case that the scheduling constraint makes it impossible to observe the main targets . with these additional galaxies , the original sample consists of 60 galaxies .",
    "ultimately , a total of 44 galaxies among these 60 galaxies are approved for the final program , after resolving visibility conflicts with targets from other approved programs . however , only 20 target galaxies were observed until the mechanical failure of the akari cooling system .",
    "the termination of the akari scientific mission is announced on 2011 june 20 , thus , these 20 galaxies are the final sample for amuses . for our final sample",
    ", we adopted their sed classes from @xcite .",
    "they classified objects using the 6.2 @xmath3 pah equivalent widths ( ews ) : sources with ew @xmath6 0.5 @xmath3 are starburst ( sb)-dominated ; sources with 0.2 @xmath19 ew @xmath19 0.5 @xmath3 are agn - sb composite and sources with ews @xmath20 0.2 @xmath3 are agn - dominated .",
    "there are 12 agns and seven starburst galaxies within the final sample .",
    "one galaxy has a composite sed .",
    "the final sample also includes two agns at z @xmath6 0.7 whose redshifts were determined after our sample selection by @xcite .",
    "the basic properties of the sample are listed in table [ table1 ] , while the redshift versus the 3.6 @xmath0 flux is presented in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the observation was carried out with the spectroscopy mode of irc on akari .",
    "the nir grism ( ng ) mode was adopted for most of the observations providing the spectral resolution of r @xmath2 120 @xcite . for eight of the targets ,",
    "nir prism ( np ) mode was used which provide the spectral resolution of r @xmath2 20 .",
    "the observations were carried out using 1@xmath21 slit aperture to avoid confusion with surrounding sources .",
    "the pixel scale of nir camera is 1.45@xmath22 and the full width half maxima of the point spread function is 3.2 pixels which corresponds to 4.64@xmath22 .",
    "all target galaxies have sizes small enough to fit in the slit aperture , although size variation is not insignificant .",
    "we present the r - band images of the target galaxies along with the 1d reduced spectra and the 2d spectrum images in figure [ fig2 ] . for several galaxies without ancillary r - band images ,",
    "@xmath1 irac 3.6 @xmath3 band images are presented .",
    "we discuss the extraction width and the target galaxy sizes in section [ dr ] .",
    "the actual exposure times run between six to seven minutes for each pointing observation .",
    "originally , three pointing observations were planned for all the targets , but a half of the targets presented in table 1 had less than three pointing observations due to the termination of the akari science mission . in total , observation of 51 pointings was carried out for 20 target galaxies .",
    "table [ table1 ] also lists how many pointings are acquired for each target .",
    "data reduction was performed with the irc spectroscopy pipeline.the irc spectroscopy pipeline subtracts scaled super - dark frames , applies linearity correction while masking saturation and monochromatic flat - fielding , subtracts background from individual sub - frames , registers and stacks images before subtracting background again from stacked images and extracting 2d spectra",
    ". then wavelength calibration , flat color - term correction , spectral tilt correction , and spectral response calibration were applied on these extracted 2d spectra .",
    "additional cosmic ray removal , stacking multi - pointing exposures , and one - sigma clipping during stacking were executed individually after processing the data through the irc spectroscopy pipeline .",
    "final one - dimensional ( 1d ) spectra were extracted from two - dimensional ( 2d ) spectral images which are binned by three pixels along the wavelength direction .",
    "the 1d spectra were extracted from the 2d spectrum images with various widths in spatial direction .",
    "first , we extracted the 1d spectra with the width of 5 pixels which corresponds to 7.3@xmath22 . in physical scales , this ranges from 1.8 kpc for the nearest target galaxy to 56.3 kpc for the farthest target galaxy .",
    "we present the extraction boxes with 5 pixel width over the r- , or irac 3.6 @xmath3 band images in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "as indicated in these figures , these extraction regions cover entire galaxies in most cases .",
    "we tried to change the extraction width in order to check if a larger extraction width unveils any hidden pah 3.3 @xmath3 emission feature from them , or it changes the extracted pha flux more than the measurement errors .",
    "specifically , we also applied extraction boxes with 10 pixels and 15 pixels .",
    "however , we did not notice any significant change of the extracted spectra over the range of extraction width for our entire sample .",
    "therefore , we use only the spectra extracted with 5 pixel extraction width for our analysis .",
    "for more details regarding data reduction process , please refer @xcite .",
    "we present the reduced spectra and fitting of emission features of 20 amuses galaxies in figure [ fig2 ] . for fbqs j0216 - 0444 and",
    "sdss j160128.54 + 544521.3 , the presented spectra are based on @xmath1 irs spectra of 5muses due to high redshifts instead of akari irc spectra .",
    "we also include insets showing fitting results of the 3.3 @xmath0 pah features for individual galaxies detected with the 3.3 @xmath0 pah emission .    in order to detect the 3.3 @xmath0 pah emission feature and measure its strength , we fit the spectra around 3.3 @xmath3 using the drude profile @xcite :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the central wavelength of the feature , @xmath25 is the fractional fwhm , and @xmath26 is the central intensity .",
    "fitting and subtracting continuum from spectra also can be a subject of debate .",
    "the most difficult issue is how to avoid absorption features which are abundant throughout mir wavelength regimes .",
    "these absorption features include co@xmath27 ice absorption at 4.27 @xmath3 , @xmath28co@xmath27 ice absorption at 4.38 @xmath3 , and co ice absorption feature at 4.67 @xmath3 .",
    "the vicinity of the 3.3 @xmath0 pah feature is not an exception with water ice absorption feature at 3.05 @xmath3 and carbonaceous dust absorption feature at 3.4 @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , we decide to apply a spline fit for continuum to the wavelength range between 3.0 @xmath0 and 3.6 @xmath0 while masking out the 3.3 @xmath0 emission feature and avoiding any obvious absorption feature by visual inspection . generally , we used the wavelength ranges between 3.0 @xmath3 and 3.2 @xmath3 , and between 3.4 @xmath3 and 3.6 @xmath3 for the continuum fit .",
    "if the 3.3 @xmath3 feature looks to be shifted upon visual inspection ( perhaps due to an unknown systematic error in wavelength calibration ) , we adjust the fitting ranges .",
    "however , there is no 3.3 @xmath3 feature detected with a shifted peak .",
    "also , if there is a clear absorption feature residing within the ranges upon visual inspection , we adjust the fitting range further out from 3.3 @xmath3 .",
    "we use an idl procedure , mpfit , to apply the drude fit onto the 3.3 @xmath0 pah feature after subtracting continuum from each individual spectrum .",
    "we do not constrain peaks and widths of drude fit unless the idl procedure can not fit any obvious emission feature .",
    "we confirm the detection of the 3.3 @xmath3 pah emission feature by visual inspection of the fitting , while considering s / n over the continuum .",
    "we measure line fluxes and ews of the 3.3 @xmath0 pah emission based on the outputs of the fitting results of drude fits and continuum fits for the sample galaxies .",
    "the flux errors are determined based on the drude fit and its errors measured by mpfit .",
    "these values are given in table [ table2 ] .",
    "when no 3.3 @xmath0 pah emission is detected , we measure upper limits . in order to calculate the upper limits ,",
    "first , we measure the standard deviation of data points within a wavelength range at which the 3.3 @xmath3 should be located .",
    "this range is decided by the average width obtained from the other galaxies detected with the 3.3 pah @xmath3 emission .",
    "the average width is 17 nm .",
    "then we assume a drude profile which has a peak three times bigger than the standard deviation , and has a width of 17 nm which is the average width of the 3.3 @xmath0 pah emission detected within our sample .",
    "we take the sums under these drude profiles as upper limits for non - detection targets .      in order to construct representative spectra of each sed class while recovering missing 3.3 @xmath0 features due to low s / n , we apply stacking analysis",
    ". we constructed blind - stacked spectra of the entire sample , the galaxies with the 3.3 @xmath0 pah feature detection , the galaxies without the 3.3 @xmath0 pah feature , the galaxies with agn seds , and the galaxies with starburst seds .    to construct the stacked spectra , we simply reproduced spectra of individual sample galaxies onto a wavelength grid set to have even step through the wavelength range between 2.5 @xmath0 and 8 @xmath0 , then constructed the spectra for each group by simply averaging spectra of group galaxies without applying any clipping or normalization .",
    "@xmath1 irs spectra provide data for any wavelength range required to construct the new spectra .",
    "we present the stacked spectra of each galaxy group in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "we concern that the stacked spectra are dominated by a few galaxies with high flux .",
    "therefore we also stacked normalized individual spectra for each group and compared the spectra to the stacked spectra produced without normalization . to do this , we normalized individual spectra by fluxes between 3.5 @xmath3 and 4.0 @xmath3 , then obtained averages of them .",
    "however , overall , these stacked spectra do not show any significant departures from the ones in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "we detect the 3.3 @xmath0 pah feature from three galaxies out of 20 target galaxies .",
    "although the 3.3 @xmath0 pah features are generally pretty weak across the sample , a couple galaxies of starburst sed class , namely 2masx j16182316 + 5527217 and 2masx j16205879 + 5425127 show very clear and strong 3.3 @xmath0 pah features .",
    "while these two galaxies have starburst seds , the remaining one galaxy , 2masx j10542172 + 5823445 has an agn sed .",
    "therefore , the detection rate for the starburst sed class sample is 29% ( 2/7 ) , while the detection rate for the agn sed class sample is 8% ( 1/12 ) .",
    "however , since the desired s / n is not achieved for a large portion of the sample , these detection rates should be considered as lower limits .",
    "upper limits varies significantly .",
    "however , generally it is smaller for the starburst sed galaxies than the agn sed galaxies .",
    "while the five sb galaxies without the 3.3 @xmath3 pah emission detection have their average upper limits of 5.97@xmath29 erg s@xmath17 , their agn counterparts have detection limits of 1.35@xmath30 erg s@xmath17 .",
    "the 3.3 @xmath3 pah luminosities range from 7.11 @xmath3110@xmath32 erg s@xmath17 of an agn at z = 0.205 ( 2masx j10542172 + 5823445 ) to 7.14 @xmath29 erg s@xmath17 of a starburst galaxy at z = 0.063 ( 2masx j16205879 + 5425127 ) .",
    "the two starburst galaxies with 3.3 @xmath3 pah detection are at z @xmath2 0.1 and their average luminosity is 9.46 @xmath29 erg s@xmath17 .",
    "the stacked spectrum of the entire sample shows a distinctive emission feature of the 3.3 @xmath0 pah emission .",
    "the ew of the stacked spectrum is 11 nm , while the spectrum stacked with the galaxies with starburst seds has the ew of 32 nm . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectrum stacked with the non - detection galaxies does not reveal the 3.3 @xmath0 pah emission feature .",
    "the 3.3 @xmath0 pah emission does not show up for the stacked agn spectrum , either .",
    "it is quite obvious that agn host galaxies do not have strong pah emission overall .",
    "we present a plot comparing luminosity of the 3.3 @xmath0 pah emission ( @xmath4 ) with infrared luminosity , @xmath33 ( figure [ fig4 ] ) . due to lack of the detected sources within the amuses sample , it is not meaningful to derive the correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath8 only for the amuses sample",

    "there have been studies claiming that agn contribution to @xmath8 is not negligible for ulirgs ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "for instance , @xcite show that , while only 15% of ulirgs at luminosities below 2 @xmath31 10@xmath42 l@xmath43 are attributed to agn , this fraction increases to 50% at higher luminosity .",
    "figure 5 of @xcite show the correlations between nuclear activity and two ir luminosities ; fir(60@xmath3 ) luminosity ( l@xmath44 ) and the 7.7 @xmath3 pah luminosity .",
    "interestingly , the correlation between the nuclear activity probed by the @xmath455100@xmath46 monochromatic luminosity and the 7.7 @xmath3 pah luminosity breaks at about l@xmath44 @xmath2 10@xmath42 l@xmath43 , while l@xmath44 correlates well with the entire range of @xmath455100@xmath46 monochromatic luminosity .",
    "the difference between these two correlations support that agn activity may contribute to @xmath8 more than it has been considered to be .",
    "also , considering the fact that there is no sign of departure for ulirg sample of @xcite from the correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath37 ( figure [ fig5 ] ) , it is more likely to be @xmath8 which causes the break .",
    "recently , @xcite found that the correlation between @xmath4/@xmath8 and @xmath8 has a break around @xmath8 @xmath2 10@xmath42 l@xmath43 from another mp of akari , msagn .",
    "there is another candidate to contribute to @xmath8 for ulirgs other than agn activity : embedded young stellar objects ( ysos ) @xcite .",
    "although embedded ysos are from star - forming regions , they should be considered as a non - typical star - forming contribution to @xmath8 . based on iso observation , @xcite found that most ulirgs have the 6 @xmath2 8 @xmath3 ice absorption feature and linked it to strongly obscured beginning of star formation .",
    "second , ulirgs suppress pah emissions , not only the 3.3 @xmath3 pah emission , but the pah emission features in general .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig4 ] and figure [ fig6 ] , both @xmath4 and @xmath37 are lower for ulirgs for a given @xmath8 .",
    "it is believed that strong uv radiation , such as one from agn , can destruct pah molecules and reduce the population of pahs .",
    "in fact , @xcite claimed that the ratio between the 3.3 @xmath3 pah luminosity and infrared luminosity for ulirgs are less than what is expected from obscured starbursts and are attributed to the deficiency of pah within ulirgs .",
    "however , it is unclear why agn at l@xmath47 l@xmath43 does not reduce the pah luminosity as much .",
    "therefore , it is plausible that most ulirgs have a large contribution from agn to their @xmath8 .",
    "a multi - wavelength analysis of the ulirgs , including the mid - ir component from hot dust , should settle this issue @xcite .",
    "however , it is still possible that there is no such departure from the correlations for ulirgs .",
    "since there are few sources detected with the pah emission features at the lower end , the correlations between the pah luminosities and @xmath8 can be skewed by the few objects with large non - star - forming contribution to their @xmath8 . in order to see",
    "if it is the case , it is required to detect more lower luminous objects in terms of pah luminosity .",
    "on the other hand , as shown in figure [ fig4 ] and figure [ fig6 ] , the 3.3 @xmath3 and 6.2 @xmath3 emission features behave similarly against @xmath8 . in order to see",
    "if there is any difference between them , we plot @xmath4 against @xmath37 and present it in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "although it looks to have large scatters , the 3.3 @xmath3 pah emission has a strong correlation with the 6.2 @xmath3 pah emission .",
    "a linear fit to the data points of all samples without the upper limits gives the correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath37 as in eq .",
    "( [ l33l62 ] ) ; @xmath48 where the units for @xmath4 and @xmath37 are erg sec@xmath17 with the correlation coefficient of 0.83 .",
    "this fit is shown within figure [ fig5 ] by a solid line .",
    "interestingly , ulirgs do not deviate from the overall trend .",
    "these ulirgs deviate rather significantly from the correlation between @xmath8 and pah luminosities ( figure [ fig4 ] and figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "therefore , it assures that the 3.3 @xmath3 pah can represent what the 6.2 @xmath3 represents , if needed .",
    "however , it is noticeable that the correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath37 is far from unity .",
    "this may be attributed to the origin of pah emission features .",
    "as mentioned before , @xcite compare variations of the profiles of various pah emission features and show that while the 6.2 and 7.7 @xmath3 emission originate from pah cations , the 3.3 @xmath3 emission feature is attributed to neutral and/or negatively charged pahs , which is suggested by several laboratory studies @xcite .",
    "therefore , although the 3.3 @xmath3 pah emission feature shows that it has the potential to be a sfr proxy like other pah emission features , it heavily relies on understanding the physical conditions of pah molecules and their emission features .",
    "it also requires to understand the deviation of ulirgs and its origin lest the power of @xmath4 as a proxy is hampered by this deviation .",
    "we describe the details of a mission project of akari , amuses and its results . with amuses ,",
    "we have investigated the 3.3 @xmath0 pah feature and its correlation with other pah features as well as other properties of the sample galaxies .",
    "the summary of our results are :    1 .",
    "we detected the 3.3 @xmath0 pah emission from three out of 20 flux limited sample galaxies and the detection rate for our sample is 15% .",
    "2 .   for the combined sample of amuses and the literature samples ,",
    "@xmath4 correlates with @xmath8 , while @xmath37 also has a similar correlation with @xmath8 .",
    "3 .   ulirgs at @xmath49 may deviate from the correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath8 of the lower luminous objects due to non - star - forming contribution on @xmath8 , such as agn activity and heavily obscured ysos , or destruction of pah molecules by agn activity .",

    "<S> however , the pah 3.3 @xmath0 feature has not been studied as much as other pah features since it is weaker than others and resides outside of @xmath1 capability . in order to detect and calibrate the 3.3 @xmath0 pah emission and investigate its potential as a star formation rate indicator , we carried out an akari mission program , akari mjy unbiased survey of extragalactic survey ( amuses ) and compare its sample with various literature samples . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained 2 @xmath2 5 @xmath3 low resolution spectra of 20 flux - limited galaxies with mixed sed classes , which yields the detection of the 3.3 @xmath0 pah emission from three out of 20 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> for the combined sample of amuses and literature samples , the 3.3 @xmath3 pah luminosities correlate with the infrared luminosities of star - forming galaxies , albeit with a large scatter (  1.5 dex ) . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation appears to break down at the domain of ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , and the power of the 3.3 @xmath3 pah luminosity as a proxy for the infrared luminosity is hampered at log[@xmath4/erg / sec@xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath242.0 . </S>",
    "<S> possible origins for this deviation in the correlation are discussed , including contributions from agn and strongly obscured ysos , and the destruction of pah molecules in ulirgs . </S>"
