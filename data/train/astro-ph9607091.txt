    "synthetic hertzsprung - russell diagrams ( hrds ) are generated through the population synthesis technique from a homogeneous library of stellar evolutionary tracks ( bertelli et al .",
    "figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the hrd - gst ( see ng 1994 and ng et al .",
    "1995 for details ) which uses these diagrams as input for star counts studies . with the hrd - gst the contribution of various stellar populations",
    "are decomposed statistically . through a detailed analysis of the star counts along the line of sight",
    "the aim of the study is to obtain constraints on    @xmath0    the galactic structure ;    the interstellar extinction ; and    the age & metallicity of the different stellar populations .",
    "the results obtained thus far have been reported in the papers i  iii ( ng et al .",
    "1995 & 1996a and bertelli et al . 1995 ) and bertelli et al .",
    "the distribution of stars along the line of sight is the result of a complex mixture of populations .",
    "the ages , metallicities and the spatial distributions of the stars from the various populations contain a wealth of information about the formation and evolution of our galaxy .",
    "towards the galactic centre there is no consensus about the ages & metallicities of the stellar populations ( disc , bulge , bar ... ) and the parameterization of the galactic structure .",
    "the large variation of the extinction over a relative small area is one of the major causes .",
    "mainly , because it is not easily parameterized .",
    "therefore the cmds of each field / region needs to be studied separately for its extinction along the line of sight .    in ( v , v ",
    "i ) cmds the effects of extinction and metallicity are difficult to separate from each other . because the extinction vector points almost in the same direction as the metallicity gradient , if present , in the hb stars ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the tilted clump of red hb stars could be caused by large differential extinction , a large metallicity spread of the hb stars or a combination of both ( catalan & de freitas pacheco 1996 ; ortolani et al .",
    "1990 & 1995 ; ng et al .",
    "1996a , b & ) .",
    "this might imply that there are no super - metal rich stars present towards the galactic centre .",
    "patchy extinction might explain the various structures present in the ( v , v ",
    "a study of the effects of various forms of extinction towards baade s window ( ng & bertelli 1996 ) shows that , if the extinction is not extremely high , patchy extinction will not give results significantly different from a poissonian type of extinction .",
    "the morphology of the red hb stars in baade s window can not be explained solely by ( patchy ) extinction and a contribution due to metallicity ought to be taken into account .",
    "3=    4=    5=    6=",
    "although unlikely , patchy extinction with very special conditions can not be fully excluded . on the other hand , the near - ir passbands are less sensitive to extinction .",
    "the best strategy is probably to determine the extinction ( if this is not too high and/or patchy ) & the metallicity range of the stellar populations from the optical passbands and verify the results with near - ir photometry .",
    "baade s window is used as an example , because this field has been studied in detail by the ogle collaboration ( udalski et al .",
    "1993 and references cited therein ) .",
    "furthermore detailed studies have been made of its cmd ( paczyski et al .",
    "1994 , ng et al .",
    "1996a ) and of its extinction ( ng & bertelli 1996a , stanek 1996 ) . from the study of the cmd",
    "( 1996a&b ) found indications for the age - metallicity of the ` bar ' population along the line of sight .",
    "it is not clear though how much the results in those studies are affected by under- or overestimating either the effect of extinction over the field or the metallicity range of the stars from various stellar populations .",
    "figure 2 shows the simulated ( v , v ",
    "i ) cmd for this window with the normalization reported in paper iii .",
    "note however , that the blue hb stars ( ) are slightly too faint with respect to the observed cmd .",
    "this is likely due to the lower limit of the metallicity ( ) adopted in the current simulation . with an even lower value of the metallicity the blue hb stars will be slightly brighter .",
    "the blue edge of the red hb is due to stars with metallicity , while the metallicity of the hb stars at the red edge could be as high as .",
    "the latter value might be considered as an upper limit for baade s window .",
    "this figure demonstrates that the reddening vector in the ( v , v ",
    "i ) cmd is indeed almost parallel to the direction in which the metallicity increases .",
    "figure 3 shows the ( j , j ",
    "the extinction is scaled from the visual with the ratios a@xmath1/a@xmath2 given by rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) .",
    "it demonstrates that in the near - ir the extinction and metallicity vector are not coupled anymore .",
    "the simulation indicates that a more detailed study of the extinction and the metallicity of the stars should be feasible with the denis survey ( epchtein et al .",
    "1993 ) , taking into account the limiting magnitudes and .    with near - infrared data it is possible to disentangle extinction from metallicity",
    ". a well constrained metallicity range would provide important clues about the star formation history of our galaxy ( ng & bertelli 1996b ) .",
    "furthermore , it might provide indications about the presence or absence of super - metal rich stars , which could improve our understanding of the nature of the uv excess in elliptical galaxies ( bressan et al .",
