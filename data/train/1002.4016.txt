    "a number @xmath7 in some set ( such as the whole numbers , integers , or real numbers ) is written in a radix representation if there are a base ( also called a radix ) @xmath8 , a finite set of digits @xmath9 , and a finite number @xmath10 such that @xmath7 can be written @xmath11 with the @xmath12 .",
    "examples of radix representations for the whole numbers include our standard decimal representation as well as binary representation . in both these examples ,",
    "the number is usually written as a string of digits @xmath13 , where the position of a digit in the string indicates the power of @xmath8 that the digit is multiplied by . thus radix representations are also known as positional number systems .",
    "it is well known that the nonnegative integers can be written in radix representation with any positive integer @xmath14 as a base and with digit set @xmath15 = \\{0 , 1 , \\ldots , \\beta-1\\}$ ] .",

    "radix representations , or positional number systems , can be generalized to higher dimensions . for arbitrary dimension @xmath18 , any matrix with integer entries",
    "@xmath19 defines a linear transformation on @xmath0 .",
    "we consider expanding matrices in the following sense .",
    "a _ dilation matrix _ is a matrix @xmath3 with integer entries , each of whose eigenvalues @xmath20 satisfies @xmath21 .",
    "the determinant of a dilation matrix is an integer @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "a dilation matrix gives a mapping of @xmath0 into a sublattice of @xmath0 with nontrivial cokernel .",
    "let @xmath3 be a dilation matrix and let @xmath24 be a set of coset representatives for @xmath25 .",
    "note that @xmath24 has @xmath26 elements .",
    "any @xmath27 is in a unique coset of @xmath25 , and thus can be written uniquely as @xmath28 for some @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this defines a euclidean algorithm for decomposing any @xmath31 : @xmath32 where the @xmath33 and @xmath34 are unique , given @xmath35 .",
    "we say that this algorithm terminates if there exists some @xmath36 such that @xmath37 for all @xmath38 .",
    "an @xmath39 matrix @xmath3 yields a radix representation ( for @xmath0 ) with digit set @xmath24 if the euclidean algorithm described above terminates for every @xmath27 .",

    "thus we can represent @xmath7 by the sequence @xmath43 just like positional number systems in one dimension . as in the case of positional number systems for @xmath1",
    ", we call the coset representatives @xmath44 digits , and to call @xmath24 a digit set .",
    "not all dilation matrices yield radix representations .",
    "for example , when @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) , with digit set @xmath47 we can represent every positive integer with a radix representation ( writing them in binary ) , but we can not represent any negative integers . when @xmath3 does not yield a radix representation , we can still find a unique sequence of digits associated to each @xmath27 using the algorithm above .",
    "however this sequence will be infinite for vectors for which the algorithm does not terminate .",
    "section [ sec_pseudo ] presents an alternative representation in the case that a dilation matrix does not yield a radix representation . in section [ sec_radix ] , we give sufficient conditions for a dilation matrix @xmath3 to yield a radix representation .",
    "the existence of a radix representation depends on the choice of digit set as well as the matrix used as a radix .",
    "a digit set can be any set of coset representatives , so many potential digit sets are possible .",
    "in general , if one takes any fundamental domain @xmath48 for @xmath0 ( that is , any set @xmath49 congruent to @xmath50 ) , then @xmath51 will be a set of coset representatives of @xmath52 , and thus a candidate for a digit set . for positional notation in one dimension , the digit set is usually taken to be @xmath53 .",
    "this is not a satisfactory digit set in the present context , since it will not allow us to represent negative numbers with a radix representation when @xmath8 is positive .",
    "we run into problems since the origin @xmath54 is on the `` edge '' of the digit set in some sense ( we will make this more precise in section [ sec_radix ] ) . in general , choosing the smallest possible coset representatives as digits , and choosing digits that can be generated by the intersection of a convex set with @xmath0 , seems to produce digit sets that are easier to work with and more likely to yield a radix representation .",
    "thus in this paper we consider the digit set @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "while not all dilation matrices give a radix representation , we give a representation that always holds .",
    "when an @xmath39 dilation matrix @xmath3 does not yield a radix representation with digit set @xmath57 , but does satisfy theorem [ pseudodigit_rep ] below , we say that @xmath3 yields a pseudodigit representation .",

    "individual vectors @xmath27 may have a radix representation with matrix @xmath3 and digit set @xmath9 , however we only say that @xmath3 yields a radix representation if _ every _ @xmath27 has a radix representation ( and thus no @xmath7 has only a pseudodigit representation ) . those vectors which do not have a radix representation will always have a pseudodigit representation instead . to distinguish between the case where all vectors @xmath7 have a radix representation , and the case where some vectors @xmath7 have only a pseudodigit representation instead of a radix representation , we say that @xmath3 yields a radix representation with digit set @xmath9 , or @xmath3 yields a pseudodigit representation , respectively .",
    "we will also say that a vector @xmath27 has a pseudodigit representation only when @xmath7 does not have a radix representation .",

    "we can see that this series converges using the root test and the fact that the spectral radius @xmath74 for any matrix @xmath75 can also be found by the formula  @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the operator norm @xmath78 since @xmath79 with @xmath80 for all @xmath68 , @xmath81 so our series does converge , and defines a norm on @xmath82 .",
    "note that , for @xmath83 , @xmath84    our norm is similar to the @xmath70 norm used by lagarias and wang  @xcite .",

    "we use the @xmath65 version of this norm , with @xmath88 , since we will often wish to compare @xmath89 and @xmath90 for vectors @xmath68 .",
    "in particular , while the traditional definition of a dilation matrix involves a lower bound on the modulus of the eigenvalues , we will be considering lower bounds on the singular values , in which case it will be more natural to consider the @xmath65 norm .",

    "a sufficient condition for this is @xmath100 which simplifies to @xmath101 that is , the sequence @xmath102 generated by the multidimensional euclidean algorithm described above is decreasing until some @xmath103 is in the ball of radius @xmath104 .",
    "once inside this ball , the subsequent @xmath33 ( for @xmath38 ) remain in the ball , since in each case @xmath105 and thus @xmath106    for some vectors @xmath35 , the sequence @xmath107 will continue to decrease down to the origin .",
