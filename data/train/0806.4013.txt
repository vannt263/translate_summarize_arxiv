    "during the past decade materials experiencing geometric frustration has been a topic of much interest , both on experimental and theoretical sides @xcite .",
    "the rich behavior in such systems is due to a large ground - state degeneracy , which renders them highly unstable to perturbations .",
    "a well known 3d frustrated structure is the pyrochlore lattice which is the backbone structure shared by many physically realistic materials .",
    "one may think of checkerboard lattices as a 2d analog of pyrochlore lattices .",
    "this is the reason why a checkerboard lattice is often considered in theoretical studies instead of the more realistic pyrochlore structure .",
    "up to now most of work has been devoted to an understanding of the magnetic properties of such frustrated lattices , while the charge degrees of freedom is waiting for more attention .",
    "actually , the charge degrees of freedom may exhibit fascinating physical properties in frustrated systems such as pyrochlore and checkerboard lattices @xcite .",
    "recently , one of the fascinating predictions on charge degrees of freedom has been proposed , say , the geometric frustration present on the pyrochlore lattices may give rise to fractional charges in two or three dimensions based on strong nearest neighbor repulsion close to half - integer filling .",
    "this proposal comes from the so called `` tetrahedron rule '' which is firstly stated explicitly by anderson @xcite to explain the metal - insulator transition in the spinel fe@xmath6o@xmath7 @xcite , where the observed entropy reduction is much less than expected from electrons without the strong short range correlation .",
    "both pyrochlore and checkerboard lattices are made up of corner sharing units which are tetrahedron or crisscrossed plaquettes .",
    "the nearest neighbor repulsion will be minimized when each of the corner sharing units contains only two particles .",
    "if the kinetic energy can be neglected , the system will possess a large ground - state degeneracy , @xmath8 for checkerboard lattices lieb1967 .",
    "taking ( putting ) one particle from ( into ) the system , two tetrahedra ( plaquettes ) will emerge , each of them contains an extra particle ( or hole ) .",
    "we will call this kind of tetrahedra ( plaquettes ) `` defects '' .",
    "a demonstration of the configuration subject to `` tetrahedron rule '' and the formation of `` defects '' is shown in fig.[fig.cfg ] . provided that the perturbation such as kinetic energy can be neglected , these two defects induced by one particle ( hole ) will propagate independently .",
    "if a particle carries charge @xmath9 , one of the defects will carry charge @xmath10 .",
    "thus , such defects are `` fractional '' .",
    "note that the above argument is valid for both hardcore bosons and fermions as well as spinless and spin-@xmath11 system . on the other hand , current laser cooling and cold atom technique",
    "make it possible to realize these systems on some artificial optical lattices zoller2005 .",
    "however , the virtual processes induced by kinetic energy will lift the high degeneracy and lead to different ground states .",
    "because of high degeneracy , any small perturbation may change the low energy states violently . to study this kind of quantum effects in spinless fermionic system on checkerboard lattices , ref .",
    "@xcite used exact diagonalization ( ed ) technique up to 32 sites . as a related problem to hardcore bosons ,",
    "xxz heisenberg model in the ising limit was studied by ed on small size lattices too shannon2004 .",
    "the ground state was identified as a nonmagnetic state of resonating square plaquettes . due to the limit of small size ,",
    "there is lack of direct evidence to address the issue of confinement or deconfinement .    in this paper",
    ", we will study spinless hardcore bosons by green function monte carlo ( gfmc ) method which can give precise results on larger lattices ( up to @xmath0 ) .",
    "the ground state energy is obtained with high accuracy and defect - defect correlation is present , which makes sense only on larger lattices .",
    "also , we will inspect the issue of charge order .",
    "the outline of the paper follows . in section ii , we introduce the extended hubbard model and derive its effective hamiltonian subjected to tetrahedron rule in the strong repulsion limit . the relations between this model and xxz heisenberg model is discussed . in section iii , a brief discussion of gfmc method is present , we also compare some results on small lattices with exact diagonalization .",
    "section iv contains the main numerical results .",
    "the final section is devoted to conclusions .",
    "we consider strong on - site repulsion @xmath12 and nearest - neighbor repulsion @xmath13 between spinless hardcore bosons on checkerboard lattices , where the intra - site interaction has been assumed to be a higher energy scale and ignored .",
    "then the extended hubbard hamiltonian is of the form @xmath14where @xmath15 denote annihilation ( creation ) operators at site @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 refers to a pair of nearest neighbor .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath19 is large enough to ensure the non - double occupancy condition , only empty and singly occupied sites ar considered .",
    "then we will focus on the strong interaction regime @xmath20 around half filling where the average occupation number per site is @xmath21 , more precisely , half of the sites are occupied and the other half of the sites are empty . in that case",
    "the tetrahedron rule is imposed by the strong nearest neighbor repulsion , @xmath22where @xmath16 belongs to a same crisscrossed plaquette . in this way , the inter - site repulsion will be minimized .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath5 , we obtain the effective low energy hamiltonian in the subspace restricted by the condition ( [ t - rule ] ) , @xmath23where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 denotes a four - site loop without crisscross , formed by sites @xmath26 .",
    "away from half filling , we consider the hole doping only , due to the particle - hole symmetry at half - filling",
    ". then the tetrahedron rule has to be modified as the following , @xmath27and the effective hamiltonian in this subspace is given by @xmath28it means that if we take one particle from the half filling system , there will emerge two defects where @xmath29 and @xmath30 elsewhere .",
    "the hopping terms ( proportional to @xmath31 ) of ( [ heff ] ) will change the defects position but @xmath32 will not . although @xmath33 , we can generally consider an effective model in which the ratio @xmath3 ranges from zero to positive infinity .",
    "as pointed out in the former references @xcite , if the virtual process at order @xmath34 can be neglected , these two defects will propagate as independent fractional objects . however , quantum effects such as the cyclic exchange of the order of @xmath34 may or may not confine these fractional defects .         a hardcore boson model can be mapped onto a spin-@xmath35 model in general .",
    "the occupation number @xmath36 corresponds to the spin component @xmath37 , and creation ( annihilation ) operators @xmath38 correspond to @xmath39 .",
    "the according spin-@xmath35 model of ( [ htv ] ) is an xxz heisenberg model .",
    "it is noted that this xxz hamiltonian is _ different _ from an usual xxz model by the _ minus _ sign before spin flip terms , which can _ not _ be mapped to a positive one by an unitary transformation on a _ frustrated _ lattices .",
    "the related effective hamiltonian in the ising limit is a cyclic exchange which was studied by shannon _",
    "et al_. shannon2004 through ed on small lattices .",
    "the authors argued that spinons ( defects ) in the above xxz model will be confined due to the ground state correlation @xcite . in this paper",
    "we confirm this argument through calculating the defect - defect correlation directly by gfmc method up to @xmath40 lattices which are large enough to suppress the size effect .",
    "if only one hole is present the two induced defects will be confined together . however , as concentration of holes and the ratio @xmath41 increase these defects may behave as independent point like objects .",
    "note that both hamiltonians ( [ hj ] ) and ( [ heff ] ) have only non - positive off - diagonal matrix elements in the fock representation @xmath42 .",
    "it implies that the many - body boson wave function can be chosen to be non - negative everywhere in the ground state .",
    "this property of the wave function will be crucial in applying the gfmc method to this system .",
    "gfmc is a general scheme for finding the lowest eigenvalue of an operator .",
    "a trial eigenvector is subjected to a time evolution whose effect is to enhance those components of the solution with the lower eigenvalues of the operator .",
    "the ground state energy can be obtained as a mixed estimate .",
    "we choose the trial state @xmath43 as an equal amplitude superposition in an invariant subspace of hamiltonian which contains the ground state . for a local operator @xmath44",
    "whose matrix elements satisfy @xmath45 , such as density - density correlation function , which does not share eigenstates with the hamiltonian , we use the `` forward - walking '' technique , well known in many - body theory binder1979,chin1984,kalos1966,liu1974,whitlock1979 , to measure the expectation values . in this way , at the @xmath46th step of iteration , @xmath47 is evaluated for each configuration @xmath48 in the ensemble @xmath49 . for the remaining @xmath50 steps of the random walk ,",
    "a record is kept of the configuration of @xmath51 from which each subsequent ensemble member has evolved . at the end of the @xmath52th step ,",
    "@xmath53 is evaluated by forming the weighted summation @xcite @xmath54where the notation @xmath55 indicates that @xmath16 is the progenitor of @xmath56 . in this paper",
    ", we will calculate density - density correlation and defect - defect correlation , both of them are local operators and this method can be applied .",
    "gfmc is a very accurate method to obtain the ground state and low - lying excited state property of many - body interacting systems . in the past",
    "it has been applied successfully to the ground state properties of helium , interacting electron gas , small molecules , heisenberg model on 2d square lattices , and lattice gauge theories binder1979,chin1984,gross1989,carlson1989,trivedi1990 . to check the precision of the gfmc method in our system ,",
    "we will compare some results from the ed with those from gfmc at small lattices with periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) .",
    "hereafter we will use pbc in this paper .",
    "the ground state energy at half filling and at one hole doped lattice are given in tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] respectively .",

    ", one sees that gfmc algorithm is an effective method to deal with spinless hardcore bosons on checkerboard lattices .",
    "simulations were carried out for @xmath61 lattices up to @xmath62 ( @xmath63 for correlations ) .",
    "time steps from 0.003 to 0.05 were used , depending on lattice size and the ratio @xmath3 , here we set @xmath64 . in practice , we use about @xmath65 generations to reach the ground state distribution , then iterate about @xmath66 generations to measure the physical quantities . to avoid self - correlation and improve the efficiency , we make an expectation value measurement only after every @xmath67 iterations .",
    "it is not advantageous to perform measurements at still larger intervals , since the measured generations are already nearly statistically independent .",
    "for ergodicity we should control the population of random walkers large enough .",
    "otherwise they will be trapped in a higher energy state instead of the ground state .",
    "according to our experience , keeping @xmath68 random walkers in each generation is enough to ensure ergodicity on @xmath61 lattice .",
    "firstly , we calculate the ground state energy at half filling which may serve as a standard to compare with other analytical or numerical study in this system .",
    "[ e0 ] shows ground state energies per site up to @xmath69 lattice .",

    "lattices , @xmath75.,width=364 ]    another issue that we shall address is whether there exists charge density order in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "although density - density correlation @xmath76 exhibits @xmath77 charge - modulation patterns on small lattices with pbc , as it behaves in fermionic system runge2004 , it may vanish in the thermodynamic limit . to answer this question , we introduce the staggered pseudospin magnetization @xmath50 , which is defined as @xmath78where @xmath79 is the number of sites on checkerboard lattices .",
    "the staggered pseudospin magnetization has its name because if we map a hardcore boson model to a spin-1/2 model this quantity is nothing but the staggered magnetization .",
    "if the system is charge ordered , @xmath50 will not vanish in the thermodynamic limit . by `` forward walking '' technique , we calculate the pseudospin magnetization up to @xmath40 lattice and extrapolated it to the thermodynamic limit by the following formula , @xmath80with @xmath81 @xmath82 and @xmath83 . as shown in fig.[mageps ] , it results in a vanishing charge order at @xmath84 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this result agrees with the claim of non - magnetic phase in ref .",
    "similar conclusion was found for spinless fermion @xcite .    ) , on finite size lattices at half filling and extrapolation to thermodynamic limit .",
    "values are shown for @xmath61 lattices , @xmath85 .",
    "zero result for @xmath86 means charge order is absent here.,width=364 ]      one of the central questions is whether or not the defects will be confined by the hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) . to answer this question",
    ", we calculate the ground state energy at one hole doping and @xmath87 at first .",
    "when @xmath87 , the two defects can not move away by hopping terms , so that we should calculate the ground state energy with fixed defects .",
    "[ e0dop ] shows the numerical results for @xmath61 lattice , @xmath88 .",
    "it turns out that the ground state energy will increase linearly as the distance between two defects increases .",
    "the distance between two defects is defined as the distance from one plaquette center to another in units of the lattice constant @xmath89 , say , it is @xmath90 for two nearest neighbor plaquettes .",
    "will increase linearly when the distance between two defects increases in the case of @xmath87 . here",
    "@xmath91 is the ground state energy at half filling.,width=364 ]    even though we turn on the hopping term , the upper bound of the gained kinetic energy is less than @xmath92 , @xmath93 for checkerboard lattices is the coordination number .",
    "since the confinement potential increases linearly with the distance between the two defects , the two defects will be confined with an average distance @xmath94 .",
    "now we turn to @xmath95 case and study how the defect - defect correlation will change as the ratio @xmath3 varies .",
    "the defect - defect correlation @xmath96 can be defined as : @xmath97where @xmath98 , @xmath99 denote the crisscrossed plaquettes",
    ".     lattice .",
    "as the ratio @xmath3 increasing , it will become more and more uniform .",
    "inset : the average distance @xmath94 between the two defects increases monotonically with @xmath3 . the saturation is due to the size effect , for a homogeneous distribution , the maximum @xmath94 will be 0.3826l .",
    "solid dots are plotted for @xmath100 lattice and circles for @xmath101 lattice.,title=\"fig:\",width=364 ] [ cr ]    the numerical result is present in fig.[cpqeps ] .",
    "one notices that when @xmath102 is small , the two defects will be linearly bounded . as @xmath3 increasing , the defect - defect correlation will be more and more uniform in a finite size lattice with periodic boundary condition .",
    "hence we expect that the average distance @xmath103 between the two defects in the infinite lattice will increase monotonically with @xmath3 .",
    "however , as shown in the inset of fig.[cpqeps ] , it will reach the saturation on a finite lattice due to the size effect , the maximum will be @xmath104 on @xmath61 lattice for a homogeneous distribution .    from the above we can conclude that the cyclic exchange @xmath32 provides a linear confinement potential between two defects but the hopping term tends to increase this average distance .",
    "if the concentration of defects @xmath105 is large enough as to satisfy @xmath106 when the average area occupied by one defect , @xmath107 , is smaller than the confinement area , @xmath108 , the defects will have a homogeneous distribution on the infinity lattice instead of to be confined together in couples .",
    "it implies that it is possible to treat these defects as independent point like excitations .",
    "in summary , we apply the gfmc algorithm to a spinless hardcore boson model with strong nearest neighbor repulsion on checkerboard lattices near half filling . to avoid any variational bias from the trial wave function , a `` forward walking '' technique has been used to compute density - density correlation and defect - defect correlations . at half filling , the ground state energy is obtained and extrapolated to infinity size .",
    "it turns out that the staggered pseudospin magnetization vanishes in the thermodynamic limit , thus charge order at @xmath77 is absent in this system .",
    "away from half filling , two defects induced by each hole ( particle ) may carry fractional charge ( @xmath2 ) . in the case of one hole doping ,",
    "we study how the defect - defect correlation changes with the parameter @xmath3 , which equals to @xmath4 when @xmath5 .",
    "the cyclic exchange is found to provide a linear confinement potential between two defects , while the hopping term as kinetic energy is tending to separate them away .",
    "moreover , we argue that these defects may propagate independently when the concentration of holes ( or defects ) is large enough .    finally , confinement ( deconfinement ) is a subtle issue , although we have presented some evidences for the possibility of the existence of defects which may carry fractional charge ( @xmath2 ) in this system , a lots of work remain to be done .",
    "this issue should be treated by other analytical and numerical methods .",
    "especially , the effective field theories for the present system are expected to describe the ground state and low lying excitations well , thus a confident conclusion for confinement / deconfinement will be achieved .",
