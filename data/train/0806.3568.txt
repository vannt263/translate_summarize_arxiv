    "there is a fairly long history of investigations regarding the nature of the mass of electron . while studying the interaction of charged particles thomson  @xcite found that the kinetic energy of a charged sphere increases by its motion through a medium of finite specific inductive capacity .",
    "he pointed out that the increase in the kinetic energy was due to the self induced magnetic field of the charged sphere and came to the conclusion that  the effect of electrification is the same as if the mass of the sphere were increased ... \" .",
    "this investigation was improved upon by heaviside  @xcite showing that the mass of a uniformly moving charged body varied with velocity .",
    "searle  @xcite extended this again as that the energy of a charged body and hence its mass increases with velocity .",
    "later on kaufmann  @xcite conducted a series of experiments on beta rays and established the dependence of the electron mass on velocity .",
    "he  @xcite showed that one - third of the fast moving electron mass is of electromagnetic origin .",
    "however , abraham  @xcite speculated that the electron mass was completely of electromagnetic origin .",
    "this result insisted kaufmann  @xcite to re - analyze his experimental data and he found that the mass of the electron is purely of electromagnetic origin .    under this illuminated background , therefore , lorentz  @xcite proposed his model for extended electron and conjectured that `` there is no other , no ` true ' or ` material ' mass , '' and thus provides only ` electromagnetic masses of the electron ' .",
    "wheeler  @xcite and wilczek  @xcite pointed out that electron has a `` mass without mass '' whereas feynman , leighton and sands  @xcite termed this type of models as `` electromagnetic mass models '' .",
    "following the idea of _ electromagnetic mass _ ( emm ) a lot of works have been carried out by several authors  @xcite under the framework of general relativity where space - time geometry is assumed to be associated with the presence of matter .    on the other hand to search the natural relation between geometry and matter through the einstein equations it is convenient to use inheritance symmetry .",
    "the well known inheritance symmetry is the symmetry under conformal killing vectors ( ckv ) which can be given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the lie derivative operator and @xmath9 is the conformal factor .",
    "here it is supposed that the vector @xmath10 generates the conformal symmetry and then the metric @xmath11 is conformally mapped onto itself along @xmath10 . in this connection it is to be noted that neither @xmath10 nor @xmath9 need to be static even though one considers a static metric  @xcite .",
    "it can be seen in the literature that due to this and several other properties ckvs provide a deeper insight into the space - time geometry connected to astrophysical and cosmological realm  @xcite .",
    "now the above works on emm models  @xcite have been performed either in @xmath12 or higher dimensional space - time under general relativity .",
    "therefore , our motivation in the present investigation is to include ckv and see whether conformal motion admits emm models or not .",
    "to do so we have considered here static spherically symmetric charged perfect fluid distribution under @xmath12 general relativity and studied three cases : ( 1 ) @xmath1 , ( 2 ) @xmath2 and ( 3 ) @xmath13 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 are respectively the usual matter density , fluid pressure and charge density of the spherical distribution .",
    "the scheme of the present investigations are follows : sections 2 and 3 are related to the einstein field equations with ckv and their solutions for the three cases . in the concluding section 4 , some remarks are made .",
    "the static spherically symmetric space - time is taken as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the metric potentials and functions of radial coordinate @xmath17 only",
    ".    now , the einstein field equations for the case of charged fluid source are @xmath18\\ ] ] where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are , respectively , the energy - momentum tensor components for the matter source and electromagnetic field . the explicit forms of these tensors are given by @xmath21 @xmath22\\ ] ] where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath23 are , respectively , matter - energy density , fluid pressure and velocity four - vector of a fluid element ( with @xmath24 ) .",
    "the maxwell electromagnetic field equations are given by @xmath25,}_{j } = 4\\pi j^{i}{(- g)}^{1/2},\\ ] ] @xmath26 } = 0,\\ ] ] where the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath27 is related to the electromagnetic potentials through the relation @xmath28 which is equivalent to the equation  ( [ eqx ] ) . in the above equations @xmath29 is the current four - vector satisfying @xmath30 , where @xmath6 is the charge density , and @xmath31 .",
    "we have considered the relativistic unit for which @xmath32 .",
    "here and in what follows a comma denotes the partial derivative with respect to the coordinates .    in view of above , therefore , the einstein - maxwell field equations can be given as @xmath33+\\frac{1}{r^2}= 8\\pi \\rho + e^2,\\ ] ] @xmath34-\\frac{1}{r^2}= 8\\pi p - e^2,\\ ] ] @xmath35 = 8\\pi p + e^2\\ ] ] and @xmath36 the electric field @xmath37 in the above equation  ( [ eqmx ] ) can equivalently be expressed in the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the total charge of the sphere under consideration .",
    "it is interesting to note that the equations ( 7 ) and ( 8) provide an essential relationship between the metric potentials and the physical parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 as follows @xmath40 again , equation ( 7 ) may be expressed in the general form as @xmath41 where m(r ) , known as the active gravitational mass , takes the form @xmath42",
    "r^2 dr.\\ ] ]    let us now consider the problem of charged fluid sphere under conformal motion through ckv which can be given by @xmath43 the above equations  ( [ eqckv ] ) give the following set of expressions    @xmath44 ,    @xmath45 ,    @xmath46 ,    @xmath47 .",
    "these , therefore , readily imply that @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are integration constants .",
    "now using solutions  ( [ eqk1 ] ) and  ( [ eqk2 ] ) , the equations  ( [ eqe1 ] ) - ( [ eqe3 ] ) take the following form @xmath53-\\frac{2\\psi\\psi^\\prime}{rc_3 ^ 2}= 8\\pi \\rho + e^2,\\ ] ] @xmath54= - 8\\pi p + e^2,\\ ] ] @xmath55    from the above equations  ( [ eqx1 ] ) - ( [ eqx3 ] ) , in a straight forward way , one can get the values for @xmath37 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 as @xmath56,\\ ] ] @xmath57 @xmath58    in the following subsections we shall consider three different cases to get exact analytical solutions in connection to relativistic charged fluid spheres with conformal motion .",
    "it is already mentioned in the introductory part that there is a special kind of solution known in the literature as _ electromagnetic mass _ ( emm ) models where all the physical parameters , including the gravitational mass , are arising from the electromagnetic field alone have been extensively studied by several researchers  @xcite . in this connection",
    "it is interesting to note that most of these investigators exploit an equation of state @xmath59 with the equation of state parameter @xmath60 which is a very common feature in the context of accelerating phase of the present universe . and fluid pressure @xmath61 .",
    "however , there are some special cases available in the literature where @xmath62 and hence @xmath63  @xcite . ]",
    "the equation of state of this type implies that the matter distribution under consideration is in tension and hence the matter is known in the literature as a ` false vacuum ' or ` degenerate vacuum ' or ` @xmath4-vacuum '  @xcite .    to consider the above mentioned equation of state let us use the equations  ( [ eqx1 ] ) and ( [ eqx2 ] ) which provide the unique relation @xmath64 therefore , the equation  ( [ key1 ] ) , due to the _ ansatz _ @xmath65 , gives the value for @xmath9 as either @xmath66 or @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is an integration constant .",
    "now , by the use of non - zero value of @xmath9 the exact analytical form for all the physical parameters can be given as @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "hence , the total gravitational mass @xmath75 , which we get after matching of the interior solution to the exterior reissner - nordstrm solution on the boundary , can be calculated as @xmath76 it can be observed from the equation  ( [ eqs ] ) that vanishing charge density @xmath6 makes @xmath77 .",
    "this implies @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "thus @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath80 have @xmath81 behaviour with proportionality constants @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively . in case of non - zero @xmath85 the values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 would be shifted in opposite directions by an amount @xmath88 with respect to @xmath80 .",
    "we also observe that @xmath6 has got @xmath89 behaviour and @xmath90 .",
    "interestingly , the vanishing charge @xmath91 does turn the total gravitational mass @xmath92 , as expressed in the above equation  ( [ eqm1 ] ) , into an _",
    "emm _ as expected under the ansatz @xmath93 . in a similar way all the other physical parameters involved in the equations ( 26 ) - ( 30 ) vanish due to vanishing charge .",
    "these results imply that conformal motion does admit this type of emm model",
    ". however , a close observation demands that as mass must not be negative so the above expression for mass puts a limit on @xmath85 with a fixed charge @xmath91 , as the second term must be smaller than the first one , which implies @xmath94 . thus charge",
    "@xmath91 limits the proportionality constants for @xmath6 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 and also the departure of @xmath86 and @xmath87 from @xmath80 .",
    "we plot all these observable parameters in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "let us consider here the _ ansatz _ in such a way that the charge density remains constant , say @xmath98  @xcite .",
    "this is the charge density of the spherical fluid distribution at the centre @xmath99 .    for the above assumption of constant charge density case",
    "the equation  ( [ eqmy ] ) leads to a proportionality between @xmath80 and @xmath100 as given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the proportionality constant .",
    "substitution of equation  ( [ eqy1 ] ) in equation  ( [ eqe2 ] ) yields @xmath103.\\ ] ]    by solving above equation  ( [ eqy12 ] ) we get @xmath104\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is an integration constant .",
    "expressions for @xmath4 and @xmath5 in equations  ( [ eqy2 ] ) and  ( [ eqy3 ] ) , thus take the following forms @xmath106 @xmath107 where @xmath108 .    therefore , the total gravitational mass @xmath75 here can be given by @xmath109 the condition , @xmath110 restricts @xmath111 as @xmath112 for the typical values of the physical parameters @xmath113 cm , @xmath114 cm and @xmath115 @xmath116 ( in relativistic units ) we get @xmath117@xmath116 and hence @xmath118 .",
    "the equation  ( [ eqrho2 ] ) for @xmath86 and equation  ( [ eqp2 ] ) for @xmath87 are represented by the interference of three terms .",
    "the first and second term become comparable to each other around @xmath119 . for @xmath120 , second term in",
    "both the equations  ( [ eqrho2 ] ) and ( [ eqp2 ] ) are negligibly small compared to the first term i.e. @xmath81 . in this case , equation  ( [ eqrho2 ] ) reads as @xmath121 , which is the same expression obtained for case - i ( @xmath122 ) but with a very small limit on the integration constant .",
    "on the other hand , equation  ( [ eqp2 ] ) reads as @xmath123 but with a different sign for the integration constant . here , unlike case - i",
    ", we do not have the condition @xmath122 .",
    "for the case , @xmath124 , it is the second term that dominates and the first term becomes negligibly small .",
    "now , the relationship between the electric charge and intensity of electric field being @xmath125 , the equation  ( [ eqe2 ] ) reduces for the total charge to @xmath126 here @xmath127 does not imply @xmath128 as we obtained it in the previous case ( @xmath129 in the equation ( 28 ) ) rather it provides the result @xmath130 .",
    "therefore , substitution of this @xmath131^{1/3}=[3q/4 \\pi \\sigma_0]^{1/3})$ ] in the equation  ( [ eqm2 ] ) does not make the above gravitational mass to vanish for the vanishing electric charge .",
    "however , for @xmath130 the constant @xmath132 becomes zero .",
    "this immediately implies that for the gravitational mass to vanish the condition to be imposed here is @xmath133 whereas for the energy density and fluid pressure this is @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , we get a unique condition for _ emm _ model which can be given by @xmath135 and can be referred as the _ critical radius _ for emm in connection to lorentz s type extended electron .",
    "this means that not the mass of the whole spherical body rather only a sphere of radius up to @xmath136 ( with @xmath137 cm  @xcite ) is of electromagnetic in origin and the rest of the mass in the form of the shell is of ordinary gravitational mass .",
    "following the previous case of constant charged density let us consider here the _",
    "ansatz _ for a constant pressure , say @xmath138 which is the central pressure of the fluid sphere and makes balance between the attractive fluid pressure and repulsive coulombian force as an effective pressure ( @xmath139 ) . in reality",
    "the physical situation may not be so simple rather very complicated one .",
    "however , we assume @xmath13 for mathematical simplicity and would like to study an idealized charged fluid model with conformal motion .",
    "now , from equation  ( [ eqk2 ] ) , one can get an expression for @xmath9 as @xmath140    hence all the other parameters can be obtained as @xmath141 @xmath142 @xmath143 @xmath144 @xmath145 @xmath146    the total gravitational mass @xmath75 in this case can be expressed as @xmath147 we observe that @xmath80 and @xmath6 with respect to their values of case i ( i.e. @xmath122 ) are 1/3 and @xmath148 times smaller , respectively .",
    "the @xmath149 with a proportionality constant @xmath150 .",
    "for @xmath151 , @xmath138 is zero .",
    "this implies that @xmath152 too has @xmath81 behaviour and @xmath96 with a value 1/3 is a constant . for the case @xmath153 , equation  [ eqm3 ] applies an upper limit on the choice of @xmath138 such that @xmath154",
    "the lower limit being @xmath155 ( as negative @xmath138 means @xmath156 ) we should limit @xmath138 between @xmath155 and @xmath157 .",
    "it can , therefore , be easily observed that for the condition @xmath158 the above gravitational mass becomes emm whereas for @xmath4 the condition is @xmath159 and that for @xmath5 is @xmath160 .",
    "we plot all the observable of this case in figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "we have analyzed the behaviour of a lorentz s ` extended electron ' within the framework of general theory of relativity and observed that conformal motions do admit historically important ` electromagnetic mass ' models .",
    "to do so we have studied three special cases , viz . ,",
    "( 1 ) @xmath1 , ( 2 ) @xmath161 and ( 3 ) @xmath13 .",
    "the results of the present investigations are , in a nutshell , as follows .",
    "_ case - i _ : it has been observed that vanishing charge density @xmath6 makes @xmath77 .",
    "this immediately implies @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "thus , all the physical parameters , including the total gravitational mass @xmath92 , vanish due to vanishing charge .",
    "these results imply that emm model admitting conformal motion under the constraint @xmath94 .",
    "_ case - ii _ : here the expression for the total charge being @xmath162 we observe that for @xmath130 the constant @xmath163 becomes zero .",
    "this readily implies that for the gravitational mass to vanish the condition to be imposed here is @xmath133 whereas for the energy density and fluid pressure this is @xmath134 .",
    "hence , we get a unique condition for _ emm _ model which can be expressed as @xmath135 .",
    "this suggests that not the mass of the entire charged sphere rather only a radius up to @xmath136 is of electromagnetic in origin and the rest of the mass in the form of the shell is of ordinary gravitational mass . in this connection",
    "we would like to mention that in the framework of general theory of relativity the electron - like spherically symmetric distribution of matter must contain some negative mass density  @xcite .",
    "bonnor and cooperstock  @xcite argue that the negativity of the gravitational mass and hence negative energy density ( @xmath62 ) for electron of radius @xmath137 is consistent with the reissner - nordstrm repulsion .",
    "_ case - iii _ : we observe that for @xmath151 , the constant pressure term @xmath138 is zero . for the case",
    "@xmath153 we have an upper limit on the choice of @xmath138 such that @xmath164 .",
    "the lower limit being @xmath155 we should limit @xmath138 between @xmath155 and @xmath157 . it",
    "can then be observed that for the condition @xmath158 the gravitational mass is of elctromagnetic in origin whereas for @xmath4 the condition is @xmath159 and that for @xmath5 is @xmath160 .    besides the above discussions we would also like to make here the following comments which appear very much relevant in connection to the present investigations :    \\(1 ) the equation of state in the form @xmath165 is discussed by gliner  @xcite in his study of the algebraic properties of the energy - momentum tensor of ordinary matter through the metric tensors and called it the @xmath4-vacuum state of matter .",
    "it is also to be noted that the gravitational effect of the zero - point energies of particles and electromagnetic fields are real and measurable , as in the casimir effect  @xcite . according to peebles and ratra  @xcite , like all energies",
    ", this zero - point energy has to contribute to the source term in einstein s gravitational field equation .",
    "\\(2 ) in the introduction we have mentioned that it is appropriate to use inheritance symmetry to search for the natural relation between geometry and matter . as a well known inheritance symmetry",
    "we , therefore , exploit here the symmetry under conformal killing vectors .",
    "the features with non - null ckv , as obtained in the present work , show that electron has some probable inheritance symmetry .",
    "\\(3 ) in the present investigation we have employed the conformal motion technique in connection to electron - like micro - particle under the @xmath0-dimensional einstein - maxwell space - time .",
    "we , therefore , feel that it may also be possible to extrapolate the present investigation to the astrophysical bodies , specially quark stars , admitting a one - parameter group of conformal motions . on the other hand",
    ", the present investigation with @xmath0-dimensional space - time can be extended to the higher dimensions to see the features with conformal motions .",
    "\\(4 ) it is argued by grn  @xcite that the negative mass and the associated gravitational repulsion is due to the strain of the vacuum because of vacuum polarization .",
    "he also argues that if a vacuum has a vanishing energy , then its gravitational mass will be negative and the observed expansion of the universe may be explained as a result of repulsive gravitation .",
    "it may also be pointed out that according to ipser and sikivie  @xcite domain walls are sources of repulsive gravitation and a spherical domain wall will collapse .",
    "to overcome this situation the charged  bubbles \" with negative mass keep the wall static and hence in equilibrium .",
    "authors ( sr and aau ) are thankful to the authority of inter - university centre for astronomy and astrophysics , pune , india for providing them associateship programme under which a part of this work was carried out .",
