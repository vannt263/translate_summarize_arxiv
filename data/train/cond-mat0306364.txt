    "the physics of quantum phase transitions in one - dimensional systems has attracted much attention in recent years because not only of its speciality  the conformal symmetries and universalities in ( 1 + 1)-critical models,@xcite but also of its generality  the quantum critical phenomena in higher dimensions.@xcite a general question is posed as follows : if a critical system defined in the ultraviolet limit is deformed by more than one relevant perturbations , what is the fate of the system ? can the criticality be reached again in the infrared limit because of the `` cancellation '' effect among these perturbations , thus a quantum phase transition takes place ? a typical model of this sort",
    "is the so - called double - frequency sine - gordon model,@xcite where an ising transition was thought to be driven by two competing relevant perturbations .",
    "the description of the phase transition requires a non - perturbative scheme being able to identify correctly those degrees of freedom that remain massive and the low - energy ones that eventually become critical and undergo the transition .",
    "the same strategy was extended to a more complicated non - abelian case  a two - leg spin-@xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnetic ladder subject to a site - parity - breaking dimerization field.@xcite the non - trivial aspect of the non - perturbative approach adopted in this study of the strong - coupling limit of the model is that one has to preserve the su(2 ) symmetry , which can not be spontaneously broken , in the ising model language which apparently has only a discrete symmetry .",
    "this hidden symmetry was realized when using very non - local duality transformations for the coupled ising models .",
    "an effective low - energy hamiltonian depicting the ensuing quantum phase transition was derived and the transmutation of all physical fields at the infrared fixed point was identified .",
    "it was unambiguously shown that a quantum phase transition occurs from the universality class of su(2 ) level 2 wess - zumino - novikov - witten ( wznw ) model in the ultraviolet limit to the universality class of su(2 ) level 1 wznw model in the infrared limit .",
    "another possible scenario was set up by introducing a staggered magnetic field , which explicitly breaks both su(2 ) and bond - parity symmetries , to the generalized spin ladder.@xcite depending on which phase the model belongs to in absence of the staggered field , either u(1 ) or z@xmath1 criticality was predicted under the effect of the staggered field . an interesting new phase that interpolates between the haldane spin liquid phase and the spontaneously dimerized phase was found beyond the transitions .",
    "the main features of this intermediate phase are : partially ( transverse ) coherent spin excitations and partially ( longitudinal ) non - vanishing string order parameter .",
    "as we can see , the physics of the generalized spin-@xmath0 ladder under the effect of the dimerization or the staggered field is very rich . in this paper",
    ", we shall scrutinize these two models in a more general perspective and try to understand the phase diagrams as a whole .",

    "( [ dfeq_m2 ] ) , the rg flow for the point on which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_md2_sfl ] .",
    "this is a very special line with a higher o(4 ) symmetry : it is not only the ridge line where all sheets meet , but also the common boundary shared by all four phases ( blocks ) of the model .",
    "( 0,170 )    since the obtained phase diagram is grounded on the relevant part of the one - loop rg equations , the position of the phase boundaries may not be so correct .",
    "for instance , considering the intimacy between the bulk b :  d@xmath103 phase and the s :  sd@xmath103 phase in the base , most plausibly the su(2)@xmath2 sheet is connected to the su(2)@xmath1 line of @xmath173 , and the boundary for the unidentified sheet is pushed to connect to the z@xmath1 line in the base ( see fig .  [ fig_md2_bas ] ) .",
    "so the space for the bulk b :  h@xmath103 phase is considerably enlarged .",
    "this is supported by the fact that , as we have mentioned , the ( @xmath153 ) standard ladder ( @xmath152 ) undergoes the su(2)@xmath2 transition under the ( @xmath8-phase ) dimerization .",
    "so the su(2)@xmath2 sheet can not terminate at the location which is a result from the approximate rg eqs .",
    "( [ dfeq_m2 ] ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_pd_md2 ] .",
    "based on the one - loop rg equations and the assumption that the relevant perturbations govern the relative structure of various phases in the parameter space , we have speculated from the infrared properties of these equations the phase diagrams of two related spin ladder models in the weak - coupling regime .    in model ( i ) , the external staggered field breaks the su(2 ) symmetry down to u(1 ) and z@xmath1 , so that the criticalities at most have the same symmetries and no room for su(2 ) to live .",
    "indeed , we find both u(1 ) and z@xmath1 criticalities come forth with the introduction of the staggered field ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_pd_md1 ] and [ fig_md1_bas ] ) , which actually evolve from the underlying su(2)@xmath1 criticality in absence of the field .",
    "the present result confirms the picture we obtained through a somewhat different approach in ref .  .",
    "in that study , we literally integrated out the fast degrees of freedom associated with the singlet modes close to the su(2)@xmath1 line and derived an effective action which describes the triplet sector with anisotropy induced by the staggered field .",
    "the vanishing of the split effective triplet mass manifests the criticality accordingly .",
    "the new observation is that the intermediate phase ( b :  i ) , which interpolates between the haldane phase ( b :  h@xmath96 ) and the dimer phase ( b :  sd@xmath103 ) , is restricted to a very limited region , and there should exist another ( unidentified ) transition which separates b :  i phase from the large-@xmath174 ( haldane ) phase ( b :  h@xmath103 ) which occupies most of the space in the phase diagram . from the infrared property ( [ m1blk ] ) , we see that b :  i phase is quite unique entirely due to the staggered field , and there is no resemblance preexisting when @xmath137 .",
    "comparing with model ( i ) , model ( ii ) is relatively simple in the sense that the su(2 ) symmetry is unbroken and the o(3 ) symmetry in the triplet sector remains , and the number of rg equations is thus reduced .",
    "all four bulk phases can basically be traced back to their counterparts when @xmath173 .",
    "none the less , as we have seen , the phase diagram of this model is by no means uneventful ( see fig .  [ fig_pd_md2 ] and [ fig_md2_bas ] ) .",
    "the phenomenon extremely intriguing is the merging of su(2)@xmath2 and z@xmath1 critical sheets into su(2)@xmath1 sheet .",
    "the information encoded in the rg equations reveals that this occurs at some critical dimerization strength @xmath175 when the system has a higher o(4 ) symmetry or su(2)@xmath15su(2 ) in the original lattice model , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "the merging line with su(2)@xmath1 criticality is shared by all four massive phases of the model .",
    "the benevolent aspect of our present theory is that we are able to assort different phases according to their infrared properties from the rg flows , and the identification of the critical sheets that emerge from the underlying critical lines in the base should be reliable .",
    "these critical sheets , including two z@xmath1 and u(1 ) in model ( i ) and su(2)@xmath1 and z@xmath1 in model ( ii ) , can also be verified to exist@xcite by means of `` integrating out '' procedure employed in ref .  , although the terminating positions of these sheets are unknown by this approach . however , as one may have perceived , the insolvency of the present theory is that not all of the transitions can be attributed .",
    "even worse is the phase boundaries resolved from the one - loop equations may not be accurate .",
    "( see our suggestions for the modification of the phase diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig_md1_bas ] and [ fig_md2_bas ] . ) therefore , although the topology of the phase diagrams we believe has been overall and qualitatively captured , the unwavering pin - pointing of the phase diagrams has to resort to other , say numerical , methods . for example , it is predicted here for model ( ii ) of pure four - spin interaction ( @xmath5 ) , when increasing the dimerization , there is only one second - order ( su(2)@xmath1 ) transition which connects directly two dimerized phases with mutually mismatched orders .",
    "if adding a bit positive @xmath4 coupling , one would expect two consecutive transitions : z@xmath1 and su(2)@xmath2 in a row .",
