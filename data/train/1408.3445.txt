    "superconductivity in doped quasi - two - dimensional compounds or at surfaces has been a focus of interest of the community since the work of ginzburg,@xcite and has gained fevered activity after the discovery of the strong dependence of the critical temperature ( t@xmath1 ) upon intercalation of the transition metal dichalcogenides and the discovery of high t@xmath1 in 2d cuprates .",
    "the way in which doping of 2d layers modifies the electronic behavior of a compound giving rise to superconductivity greatly depends on the specific system . in copper oxides",
    "there is a magnetic insulator to strange metal transition that completely modifies the electronic structure .",
    "however , in bismuthates and in electron - doped nitridochloride @xmath6ncl superconductors ( where @xmath0 is a group ivb transition metal ti , zr , hf ) there is only pauli paramagnetic behavior . the cause of superconductivity in this latter class of materials remains unknown , with neither spin nor conventional phonons being responsible for their superconducting behavior , as we discuss below .",
    "@xcite    the superconductivity in transition metal nitridochlorides ( with maximum t@xmath1 = 17 , 15 , 26 k for ti , zr , hf respectively ) emerges when the insulating parent compounds are electron - doped.@xcite to clarify the mechanism of superconductivity an understanding of the electronic behavior is crucial because only then can the key issue of electron pairing be addressed .",
    "electron doping in the metal nitride double honeycomb planes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ zrncl_struct ] , is achieved by intercalation of alkali ions into the van der waals gap between cl layers .",
    "large organic molecules may also be included.@xcite however , the origin of the high t@xmath1 remains unknown , as the characteristics of this class of superconductors are unique .",
    "there is a low dos at the fermi level and a weak electron phonon coupling has been suggested both experimentally @xcite and theoretically .",

    "zr atoms are blue , n red , cl green and li yellow.,title=\"fig:\",width=111 ]    there are several unusual characteristics that make the @xmath6ncl class of superconductors unique .",
    "first , and an aspect that is not usually emphasized , they are extremely bad conductors , with reported residual resistivity ( t@xmath70 ) of @xmath8 @xmath9 cm.@xcite in some cases the temperature dependence crosses from metallic to semiconducting and weak localization behavior arises just above t@xmath1 .",
    "second , except near the critical concentration @xmath10 where the insulator to metal transition occurs,@xcite t@xmath1 is almost independent of the doping level @xmath5 whereas the fermi level dos undergoes a change as doping is increased .",
    "specifically , there is no superconducting dome , and the constancy of t@xmath1 continues well into the region where the density of states at the calculated fermi level @xmath11 increases sharply , as the @xmath0 ion @xmath12 states other than the in - plane @xmath13 orbitals begin to be filled .",
    "@xcite thirdly , there is one property that correlates strongly with t@xmath1 : the separation of the @xmath14 bilayers along the @xmath15 direction . for the hf and zr counterparts , from the minimum separation , at small li intercalation , t@xmath1 increases sharply by @xmath1630% before leveling off and remaining nearly constant up to the largest separations that have been achieved ( @xmath17 20  ) , by introducing large molecules along with the dopant metal atoms.@xcite",
    "thus the superconductivity in these systems is truly 2d .",
    "the very `` bad conductor '' aspect can be clarified by trying to apply conventional fermi liquid metallic formalism . interpreting the residual resistivity @xmath18 @xmath17 10@xmath19 @xmath20@xmath21 cm gives , with in - plane @xmath22 3 ev , @xmath23 10 ev , corresponding to a totally washed out band structure . putting @xmath24 together with the fermi velocity @xmath25 10@xmath26",
    "cm / s leads to a mean free path ( @xmath27= 2@xmath28/@xmath29@xmath30 ) that implies the brillouin zone ( bz ) would be completely wiped out .",
    "this analysis indicates the transport is not metallic , and an alternative picture is needed to understand electronic behavior .",
    "takano _ et al .",
    "_ , on the other hand , use the measured superconducting coherence length @xmath31 , the bcs relation for @xmath32 , and the phenomenological relation @xmath33= @xmath34 + @xmath27@xmath35 to infer values of @xmath27@xmath17 10 nm for their samples .",
    "@xcite in any case , the lack of consistency in these interpretations indicates problems with fermi liquid theory for transport .",
    "this conclusion gains support from the recent report from @xmath36zr and @xmath37n nmr studies@xcite , which finds pseudogap character typical of non - fermi liquid phases in the 0.06@xmath38@xmath5@xmath380.10 regime .",
    "this is the regime where enhanced susceptibility is reported;@xcite",
    "curiously , the nmr data show no evidence of enhanced spin fluctuations on the verge of the superconductor to insulator transition , causing difficulties for applying a model of pairing by this mechanism .",
    "kuroki proposed that the high t@xmath1 in doped hf / zrncl is a characteristic feature of the spin fluctuation - mediated superconductivity in a honeycomb lattice.@xcite    superconductivity emerges in this system from a very badly conducting state .",
    "jaramillo _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite have proposed that a strong interaction that can shift spectral weight over a large energy scale is necessary for bad metal conductivity . in the case of rare - earth nickelates",
    ", this strong interaction happens between lattice distortions and ni - o covalence , but its origin may vary depending on the system ( and nickelates do not superconduct ) . the question of whether this explanation may apply to the bad conductivity in @xmath6ncl superconductors and if so , what the driving interaction might be , is still open .",
    "there is no local moment behavior , so the electronic state and the pairing mechanism are very different from the high temperature superconducting cuprates and fe - based materials .",
    "based on the standard landau fermi liquid ( metallic ) viewpoint , the electron - phonon coupling has been calculated to be clearly too weak to account for the observed values of t@xmath1 . @xcite from density functional theory ( dft ) based calculations for li - doped zrncl , @xmath39 of only 5 k is obtained , using a typical value of the coulomb pseudopotential for a normal metal @xmath40= 0.1.@xcite a suggestion was made by yin _",
    "et al._@xcite that a different exchange - correlation functional , the hybrid ( part unscreened exchange ) functional , is more appropriate for this class of doped insulators .",
    "they found that the additional exchange potential increases the shifts of certain bands due to selected frozen phonon modes , giving them an enhanced electron - phonon coupling .",
    "however , a full calculation was not carried out . in any case ,",
    "whichever functional is chosen , it seems apparent from the observed resistivity that li@xmath41zrncl has no transport fermi surface at all , or very few mobile carriers , or both .",
    "the n isotope shift of t@xmath1 seems to be non - zero but is so small as to be very discouraging for any lattice mechanism relying on n displacements .",
    "@xcite the density functional theory for superconductors ( scdft)@xcite has been shown to reproduce the observed t@xmath1 of a selection of phonon - mediated superconductors.@xcite this approach differs largely in the dft - based treatment of the coulomb interaction . when scdft was applied to @xmath0ncl superconductors,@xcite a t@xmath1 of only 4.3 k and 10.5 k",
    "was obtained for the zr and hf counterparts , respectively .",
    "in addition , t@xmath1 increases with increasing doping level in clear contrast to the experimental results . in li@xmath41zrncl , an enhancement of t@xmath1 with",
    "a reduction in the carrier density in the low doping regime towards the metal - insulator transition has been observed.@xcite    several works have tried to consider the origin of pairing in strongly layered superconductors beyond the standard migdal - eliashberg ansatz .",
    "et al.__@xcite have considered that the dynamical screening of the coulomb interaction is essentially different in layered structures , and built a model that provides for an additional contribution to the pairing from dynamical electronic screening and low energy plasmons , which leads to a drastic enhancement of t@xmath1 in @xmath0ncl superconductors .",
    "we also mention the work of pashitskii and pentegov@xcite that has included classes of vertex corrections within the picture of a plasmon mechanism of pairing .    to elucidate the electronic behavior and help to understand the origin of the unique properties of this class , we analyze the dependence of the dielectric response on frequency and concentration for li@xmath41zrncl calculated within the random phase approximation from the kohn sham band structure .",
    "this treatment is consistent with the landau fermi liquid picture which as we have noted is quite suspect for transport but may yet apply for higher energy excitations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after describing the computational methods and crystal structure in sections [ structure ] and [ methods ] , we revisit the electronic structure of the pristine compound and li@xmath41zrncl ( @xmath42 0.16 , 0.25 and 0.50 ) , analyzed using supercells to reproduce the desired doping levels ( section [ es ] ) .",
    "the obtained electronic structure of the doped compounds is then contrasted to that obtained using the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) . in section [ optic ] , the dielectric response versus frequency and concentration is discussed .",
    "differences in the dielectric behavior do not correlate with doping in the observed variation of t@xmath4 suggesting that pairing based on the electronic overscreening is not a viable picture .",
    "although the compound @xmath43-zrncl has been known since the 60s , its crystal structure was for some time under debate.@xcite we have used the structures determined by x - ray diffraction on single crystals@xcite that confirmed the results obtained by others using neutron powder diffraction.@xcite    the structure of the insulating parent compound @xmath43-zrncl is shown in the left panel of fig .",

    "each zr atom is bonded to four neighboring n , three belonging to the same zrn layer and one to the adjacent layer .",
