    "the possibility of multiquark states has been discussed for a long time @xcite . in particular , the possible @xmath8 states have been suggested in many theoretical efforts to understand light scalar mesons ( see , for example , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath9 states were proposed in descriptions of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where the strong attraction between @xmath12 and @xmath13 plays an important role @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the color - anti - triplet quark pair and the color - triplet anti - quark pair , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath14 molecule states were suggested to understand the properties of @xmath11 and @xmath15@xcite .",
    "since the masses of negative - parity mesons are expected to be above 1 gev in a naive interpretation with @xmath16-wave @xmath17 states , it is considered that these scalar mesons below 1 gev may be hybrids of @xmath16-wave @xmath17 and compact @xmath18 with meson - meson tails in the outer region , as argued in ref.@xcite . even if the @xmath9 components are dominant in a certain meson whose minimal content is @xmath19 , it is difficult to find direct evidence of the @xmath9 components due to mixing with the conventional @xmath17 state via the annihilation of @xmath17 pairs .",
    "our main interest here is the possibility of narrow `` tetraquark '' states , whose minimal quark content is 4@xmath20 .",
    "the recent observation of @xmath21(2317)@xcite and reports of the pentaquark baryon @xmath22 @xcite revived motivation for experimental and theoretical studies on multiquarks in hadron physics , though the existence of @xmath23 is yet to be well established .",
    "one of the striking characteristics of the @xmath23 is its narrow width . for a theoretical interpretation of why the @xmath23 is extremely narrow , the possibility of the spin - parity @xmath24 and",
    "@xmath25 has been discussed by many groups @xcite . since only the @xmath16-wave and @xmath26-wave",
    "are allowed in @xmath27 decays from the @xmath24 and @xmath25 states , respectively , the width should be suppressed due to a high centrifugal barrier . the transition into meson - baryon states should be further suppressed if the pentaquark has an exotic color configuration @xmath2 .",
    "the factor @xmath28 in the transition appears from the overlap of the color wave functions of quarks .",
    "in addition to suppression due to the color degrees of freedom of 5 quarks , another suppression effect can be considered in flux - tube pictures@xcite , because the transitions between different flux - tube topologies are suppressed due to a rearrangement of the gluon field .",
    "this means that the decays from such exotic flux - tube configurations as @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : flux-4q](e ) ) into meson - baryon - like @xmath29 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : flux-4q](f ) ) are suppressed . in general",
    ", the different flux - tube configuration appears in multiquarks that contain more than 3 quarks , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux-4q ] , and the coupling between the disconnected tube and the connected tube topologies should be strongly suppressed .",
    "the predicted spin - parity @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the pentaquark @xmath30 are abnormal in a naive quark picture , where the @xmath31 should be the lowest state , while other spin - parity states are expected to be highly excited .",
    "originally , a narrow @xmath24 was predicted in the skyrme soliton model by diakonov et al.@xcite . for a theoretical explanation of the @xmath24 state from the point of view of the constituent quarks , the diquark picture and the triquark picture",
    "are proposed in refs.@xcite .",
    "recently , constituent quark model calculations @xcite suggested an abnormal level structure in the compact @xmath30 system with the @xmath2 configuration , where the masses of the @xmath24 and/or @xmath25 states may degenerate with the @xmath31 state .",
    "we now turn to a discussion on the possibility of tetraquarks . by replacing a @xmath32-diquark in the @xmath23 with an @xmath33 quark ,",
    "it is natural to expect that a tetraquark with the @xmath0 content may exist at nearly the same energy region . in order to search for a narrow tetraquark",
    ", we follow the analogy of the theoretical explanation why the pentaquark @xmath23 can be narrow .",
    "firstly , one should consider those states with unnatural spin and parity , which can not decay into two light hadrons ( psuedscalar mesons ) in the @xmath34-wave channel .",
    "second , the exotic flux - tube configurations with connected tubes ( fig .   [",
    "fig : flux-4q](c ) and ( e ) ) would be essential to stabilize the exotic hadrons .",
    "we then propose a @xmath4 @xmath0 state with the @xmath35 configuration as a candidate of narrow tetraquark states .",
    "it should be stressed that two - body @xmath14 decays from any @xmath4 @xmath0 state are forbidden because of conservation of the total spin and parity .",
    "the lowest threshold energy of the allowed two - body decays is 1.39 gev for the @xmath36 channel .",
    "if the mass of the @xmath4 @xmath0 state lies below the @xmath37 , two - meson decay channels are closed , and hence its width must be narrow .",
    "the 4q states have been proposed by jaffe in 1977 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath38 diquark and the @xmath13 anti - diquark correlations play an important role in the stability of the @xmath9 state , because there exists attraction between @xmath38 and @xmath13 due to the confining and the one - gluon - exchange(oge ) potential . moreover , it is known that the spin - zero flavor - singlet @xmath12 diquark is favored , because it gains the color - magnetic interaction .",
    "thus , the diquark(anti - diquark ) correlation leads to confined @xmath9 states with the @xmath35 color configuration , which might make the @xmath9 system compact and stable . in the @xmath4 state of the tetraquark @xmath39",
    ", one can naturally expect that the lowest is the isoscalar @xmath4 state with a spin - zero @xmath40 and a spin - one @xmath41 in a spatially symmetric orbit . in the spatially symmetric @xmath42",
    ", the spin - zero(spin - singlet ) configuration is forbidden , and hence the @xmath42 must have spin - one .",
    "although the spin - one @xmath42 feels some repulsive color - magnetic interaction , the repulsion is expected to be small because the color - magnetic term in the oge potential is suppressed by the quark - mass factor @xmath43 . in the flux - tube model , the @xmath18 state has the exotic tube topology shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : flux-4q](c ) . therefore , its coupling with two - hadron states should be small , due to the suppressed transitions between the different tube topologies , ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the tetraquark @xmath0 states are discussed in ref.@xcite , and noted as @xmath44-mesons . in ref.@xcite , the theoretical mass for the isoscalar @xmath45 state is predicted to be 1.65 gev in the mit bag model@xcite .",
    "recently , the isoscalar @xmath0 in the flavor @xmath46 group was suggested in analogy with the @xmath23 by t. burns et al.@xcite and by karliner and lipkin @xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the possibility of a @xmath47 state is discussed .",
    "however , we should remark that the @xmath48 is not allowed in the isoscalor @xmath0 system within the spatially symmetric configuration , and hence , the @xmath48 is expected to be unfavored .",
    "the tetraquark @xmath0 is called a @xmath3-meson in ref.@xcite , where the @xmath49 state with the orbital angular momentum @xmath50 is predicted in the mass region @xmath51 1.6 gev .",
    "although the @xmath49 state may gain color - magnetic attraction , it needs the @xmath50 excitation energy , and is expected to be higher than the spatially symmetric state .",
    "another claim for the @xmath52 state is that it can decay into @xmath16-wave @xmath14 states",
    ". the centrifugal barrier may not be high enough to stabilize the state much above the threshold energy .",
    "therefore , we think that the @xmath3(@xmath4 ) is a better candidate for narrow tetraquarks .    in this paper , we consider the @xmath3-meson with @xmath4 by a constituent quark model .",

    ", we adopt the upper limit of the @xmath156 width in ref.@xcite , though there still remains an ambiguity in the experimental data .",
    "next , we discuss the effect of @xmath200 decay on the width . in the above estimation of @xmath201 , the effect of this mode is already included in the total width of the @xmath54-meson .",

    "we again assume that the coupling for @xmath204 is the same as that for @xmath205 , and estimate the width by using the ratio of the phase space for the @xmath145(@xmath206 gev ) , @xmath207 , to that for the @xmath155(@xmath195 gev ) , @xmath208 , as @xmath209 .",

    ", we roughly evaluate the width of the @xmath196-meson by assuming the same coupling for @xmath227 and @xmath228 as those for @xmath169 and @xmath204 , respectively . in the present estimation",
    "we choose the couplings to fit the full width of @xmath54 . in the case",
    "that the couplings are enhanced via the annihilation and creation of a @xmath17 pair in the @xmath54-meson , the width of the @xmath196-meson might be smaller than the present estimation .",
    "we discussed the possibility of the @xmath4 state of the isoscalar tetraquark ( s=+2 ) , @xmath3-meson , with the @xmath0 content .",
    "if the pentaquark @xmath1 has the @xmath2 configuration , the @xmath53 is expected to exist at an energy lower than , or close to , the pentaquark @xmath1 mass .",
    "this leads to a possible appearance of the @xmath3-meson as a resonant state , which may be observed in the @xmath7 channel .",
    "we investigated the @xmath53 with a constituent quark model .",
    "the flux - tube quark model with antisymmetrized molecular dynamics(amd ) was applied to @xmath9 systems in the same way as in the pentaquark study in ref.@xcite .",
    "based on the picture of a flux - tube model , we solved the @xmath9 dynamics in the @xmath18 model space by the variational method .",
    "the results suggest that the @xmath53 may exist at around 1.4 gev .",
    "since the predicted mass of the @xmath53 is close to the lowest ( @xmath37 ) threshold in the allowed two - hadron decays , the present results imply that the @xmath53 may exist as a resonance , and its width may be not very broad .",
    "we also calculated the @xmath229 @xmath230 state , which is associated with a non-@xmath17 @xmath54-meson .",
    "the calculated mass of the @xmath54 with the @xmath9 configuration suggests an interpretation that the @xmath9 state may correspond to one of the @xmath54-mesons in the @xmath55 mass region .",
    "@xmath155 and @xmath156 are candidates of the @xmath9 state .",
    "if we assume that the couplings for @xmath169 and @xmath231 are the same as those for @xmath232 and @xmath233 , respectively , we can evaluate the width of the @xmath3 to be 20 - 80 mev from the phase space for these two - hadron decay modes .",
    "provided that the coupling for the two - hadron decays in the @xmath53 is small enough , the dominant decay should be a direct three - hadron decay , @xmath234 , with a small phase space , and hence the @xmath53 should have a small width .",
    "recently , the @xmath3-meson was discussed by burns et al.@xcite and by karliner and lipkin @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    ", it was mentioned that the @xmath235 can be narrow , because the lowest allowed decay mode is a four - body @xmath236 channel with a small phase space .",
    "however , the @xmath48 state is forbidden in the isoscalar @xmath0 system within spatially symmetric configurations , and hence , the @xmath235 is expected to be energetically unfavored .",
    "burns et al .",
    "predicted the @xmath237 with @xmath50 at @xmath51 1.6 gev with a width of @xmath238 mev , which can decay into @xmath239 .",
    "although the color - magnetic attraction may be larger in the @xmath240 state than in the @xmath241 state , the @xmath240 must have the @xmath50 excitation energy .",
    "another claim for the @xmath52 state is that it can decay into @xmath16-wave @xmath14 states .",
    "the centrifugal barrier may not be high enough to stabilize the state much above the threshold energy .",
    "therefore , we consider that the @xmath53 is a better candidate of narrow tetraquarks .    our calculations of the tetraquark @xmath242 and the pentaquark @xmath23 are based on the color - configurations @xmath18 and @xmath2 .",
    "we ignore @xmath84 configurations because the @xmath84 is an excited configuration , and is unfavored in the strong - coupling picture .",
    "we should remark that the preference of the spin - parity @xmath243 in the @xmath3 system does not depend on the color configuration .",
    "this is because , in the isoscalar @xmath0 with a spatially symmetric configuration , other spin parities are forbidden , and therefore the spin parity is uniquely determined to be @xmath4 .",
    "this means that , even in the color - configuration @xmath244 , as suggested in refs.@xcite , only @xmath4 is allowed in the spatially symmetric @xmath145 state .",
    "if the @xmath23 has a triquark - diquark structure @xmath245 with the relative @xmath16-wave motion as proposed by karliner and lipkin@xcite , it is expected that the @xmath241 mass with a spatially symmetric @xmath244 configuration would be close to , or could be smaller than , the @xmath23 mass due to the kinematic energy gain .",
    "another important channel is the meson - meson @xmath246 configuration , though it can be expressed by a linear combination of the @xmath139 and @xmath244 configurations .",
    "if the @xmath242 mass is smaller than the lowest meson - meson threshold @xmath37 , mixing of the @xmath246 state may not have a significant effect on the @xmath145 width , because the @xmath242 is bound in the @xmath37 channel . in the case",
    "that the @xmath242 is heavier than the @xmath37 threshold , channel mixing should be taken into consideration to estimate its width . in [ subsec : width ] , we gave an analysis of the widths by assuming that the decay mechanism and the coupling in the @xmath160 are the same as those in the @xmath54-meson .",
    "within this assumption , the channel - coupling effect on the widths is effectively included in the adopted total width of the @xmath54-meson . for a further detailed discussion of the stability of the @xmath241 , coupled calculations of different color configurations are required .",
    "we should point out that the allowed decay channels are different among these three predictions ( @xmath4 , @xmath247 , and @xmath47 states ) of the @xmath3-mesons . for the @xmath53 , @xmath52 , and @xmath248 , the decay modes are @xmath161 , @xmath14 and @xmath236 , respectively .",
    "in order to establish the @xmath0 content in the tetraquark @xmath3-meson , it is necessary to observe not @xmath249 , but at least two @xmath250s , because the @xmath249 contains the @xmath251 component as well as the @xmath252 . in that sense ,",
    "the @xmath7 decay from the @xmath145(@xmath243 ) predicted in the present work is suitable for an experimental tetraquark search .    in the constituent quark model calculations of refs.@xcite , there is no indication for the existence of multiquark hadrons , except for the @xmath11 and @xmath15 as @xmath253 molecules @xcite , while interpretations of scalar mesons , like @xmath10 , @xmath162 and @xmath21(2317 ) , by four - quark states have been suggested in several quark model calculations @xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the absence of the pentaquark was claimed , which is inconsistent with the observation of the pentaquark @xmath23 . in order to explain the absolute mass of the @xmath1 within constituent quark models , we need an extra attraction for the multiquark system in addition to a pair - wise interaction . in the present calculation",
    ", we did not obtain a quantitative value of this extra attraction from fundamental theory ; instead , the many - body potential was taken into account in terms of the flux - tube potential , and we phenomenologically evaluated it by using the observed @xmath23 mass as a input .    in the present work , we used a simple hamiltonian with the confining force , and the coulomb and color - magnetic terms in the oge potential . for a systematic description of the hadron spectra ,",
    "there still remain such problems as fine tuning of the interaction parameters and inclusion of the tensor and spin - orbit interactions in the hamiltonian . to obtain theoretical insights into multiquark hadron physics ,",
    "an experimental search for the tetraquark is necessary as well as further experimental studies on the pentaquark .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath53-meson is proposed as a good candidate of the tetraquark , which would be observed in the @xmath7 decay channel .",
