    "<S> a comparison of our results for the form factors of @xmath3 with the lattice qcd predictions within heavy quark effective theory and zero recoil limit is presented . </S>",
    "<S> our results of the branching ratio are in good agreement with the constituent quark meson model for ( @xmath1 ) and experiment for ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the result of branching ratio for @xmath5 indicates that this transition can also be detected at lhc in the near future . </S>"
