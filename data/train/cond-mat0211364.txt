    "the low - temperature optical spectra of semiconductors show a peak near the fermi energy .",

    "( qwrs ) , the screening effect is much weaker so that the excitonic enhancement becomes very strong and one obtains the fermi - edge singularity ( fes ) @xcite . in their experiments at low temperatures ,",

    "@xcite have found that the photoluminescence ( pl ) spectra of modulation - doped gaas quantum wires are dominated by a fermi - edge singularity , which shows a strong temperature dependence and a pronounced spectra shape .    in this work ,",
    "we calculate the low - temperature pl spectra of gaas qwrs by solving the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) of the e - h pair green s function within the dynamically screened approximation .",
    "our calculation includes the following many - body effects : phase - space filling , screening of the coulomb interaction , band - gap renormalization .",
    "instead of using a phenomenological damping constant we shall take into account the broadening and lifetime effects by determining the imaginary part of the electron and hole self - energy .",
    "we shall compare our theoretical results with experimental findings by calleja et al .",
    "in gaas quantum wires @xcite and with theoretical results obtained from the statically screened approximation and the hartree - fock approximation as well .",
    "we start from an ideal 2d quantum well in which the electrons and holes are confined laterally by a harmonic oscillator potential with a total intersubband spacing @xmath0 .",
    "the 1d coulomb interaction between the charge carriers is given by averaging the bare 2d coulomb interaction with the lateral envelope wave functions : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the reduced electron - hole mass and @xmath3 is the zeroth - order modified bessel function .",
    "the photoluminescence spectrum @xmath4 is calculated from the imaginary part of the optical dielectric function @xmath5 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the inverse thermal energy , @xmath8 the combined chemical potential of the e - h pair .    in the linear response theory @xcite the optical dielectric function of e - h system",
    "is obtained from : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the e - h pair green s function [ 2,5,9 - 10 ] .    the effective bethe - salpeter equation for the e - h pair green s function in the dynamically screened approximation is given by [ 2,5,9 - 10 ] : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the fermi distribution function , @xmath13 are the renormalized band energies for electrons @xmath14 and holes @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the effective e - h interaction , and @xmath17 is the single - particle green s function .    in the plasmon - pole approximation ( ppa )",
    "[ 1 - 3,5,9 - 11 ] , the dynamically screened coulomb potential is given by : @xmath18 where @xmath19 the effective e - h interaction in the ppa reads : @xmath20 where @xmath21,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath22 is the bose distribution function .",

    "@xmath27 is a small phenomenological damping term describing impurity , defect scattering , inhomogeneities in the system , and other possible broadening process .",
    "@xmath27 should be small compared with the excitonic binding energy in quantum wires @xcite .",
    "if one replaces the effective e - h interaction @xmath28 in ( [ veff ] ) by the statically screened interaction @xmath29 or the bare coulomb potential @xmath30 and the self - energy in ( [ se ] ) by @xmath31 $ ] or @xmath32 , one retrieves the bse in the statically screened approximation treated by other authors [ 1 - 3,11 ] or in the hartree - fock approximation treated by grus et al @xcite .",
    "note that the self - energy in the statically screened approximation or in the hartree - fock approxiamation is real and one has to introduce a phenomenological damping constant @xmath33 , which is corresponding to the sum of the imaginary part of the self - energy of electron and hole , to describe the broadening and lifetime effects [ 1 - 3,6,11 ] .",
    "we calculate pl spectra by solving the bse for gaas qwr using the following parameters : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is excitonic binding energy in gaas qwr ) .    in fig .",
    "1 we compare our pl spectra in the dynamically screening approximation ( fig .",
    "1a ) with experimental results by calleja et al . ( fig .",
    "1b ) taken for e - h density @xmath41 and at different temperatures @xcite . at very low temperature ( @xmath42 )",
    "we obtain a strong fes near the chemical potential @xmath43 . with increasing temperatures the peak shifts to the red and the fes intensity decreases quickly due to increasing thermal broadening of the fermi function and increasing thermal collisions .",
    "our theoretical results agree rather well with the pl measured results ( fig .",
    "1b ) in modulated - doped gaas qwrs .    in figs .",
    "2 we plot pl spectra in the unscreened hartree - fock approximation ( fig .",
    "2a ) and in the statically screened approximation ( fig .",
    "2b ) at @xmath44 using a damping constant @xmath45 . in this simplest hartree - fock approximation the pl intensity increases suddenly when the chemical potential coincides with the excitonic resonance energy ( at @xmath46 ) . besides that",
    ", the spectra show a blue shift with increasing temperatures .",
    "contrary to the hartree - fock approximation the statically screened approximation shows a red shift with increasing temperatures ( fig .",
    "2b ) but the spectral shape is still much less pronounced compared to that of measurements .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the temperature dependence of pl spectra of photoexcited qwrs in three different approximations : hartree - fock , statically screened- , and dynamically screened approximation .",
    "while the dynamically screened approximation agrees rather well with recent experimental findings @xcite the statically screened approximation poorly describes the measurements .",
    "the unscreened hartree - fock approximation , moreover , fails totally to describe the experiments . +",
