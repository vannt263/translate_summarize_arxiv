    "it has been known for many decades that an accelerated detector , moving in a quantum field prepared in the ground state of the field modes for an inertial frame , will become excited@xcite . in the case of constant acceleration ,",
    "@xmath2 , the frequency response of the detector is completely equivalent to the response of an inertial detector in a thermally excited field with a temperature @xmath3 given by @xmath4 .",
    "we call this unruh - davies radiation",
    ". quite clearly , such an effect would be very difficult to see given current technologies .",
    "in this paper we suggest an analogous system , based on detecting phonons of the vibrational modes of cold trapped ions@xcite . in many ways",
    "this parallels a theme , pioneered by unruh , of sonic equivalents for quantum fields in curved space time@xcite .",
    "our analogy is based on an alternative view of unruh - davies radiation in terms of the time dependent red shift seen by an accelerated observer@xcite . by controlling the trapping potentials of trapped ions it is possible to modulate the normal mode frequencies so that they have the same time dependent phase as red - shifted frequencies seen by a constantly accelerated observer .",
    "suppose now that the ions are prepared ( using laser cooling ) in the ground state of the normal modes of vibration of the time independent trap . if a suitable detector of the vibrational quanta for the trapped ions was available , they could be used to detect excitations out of the ground states of vibrational motion due to the frequency modulation",
    ". this would be analogous to the response of an accelerated detector to a scalar field prepared in a minkowski ground state .",
    "fortunately the ions themselves can be made to respond as phonon detectors .    in ion trap implementations of quantum information processing ,",
    "a laser is used to couple the vibrational motion of a trapped ion to an electronic transition between states which we denote @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "furthermore it is possible to readout one or the other of these internal electronic states , say @xmath6 , using a laser ( the readout laser ) to drive a cycling transition between @xmath6 and another electronic state , thereby producing fluorescence conditional on whether the ion was in state @xmath6 .",
    "such measurements are highly efficient and closely approximated by a perfect projective measurement of the internal electronic state . in effect",
    "this scenario defines a _ phonon detector _ that may be turned on and off at will . to be more specific",
    ", we can implement various kinds of phonon detectors by carefully tuning the laser frequency @xmath7 to one of the vibrational sidebands of the ion .",
    "this enables one to realize rather unconventional phonon detectors that respond to antinormally ordered moments ( blue sideband ) as well as the more conventional normally ordered moments ( red sideband ) as we explain in more detail below .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian describing the coupling of the internal and vibrational degrees of freedom of the @xmath8th ion in a linear array of ions in a trap ( in the interaction picture , and lamb - dicke limit ) can be written as @xcite ^(m)_i = _ 0 k _",
    "m(t)_x(t ) where _ x(t)=e^-it _ - + , and @xmath9 is the ( scaled ) rabi frequency , @xmath10 is the detuning between atomic resonance and the laser , @xmath11 is the wavevector , @xmath12 is the angle the laser beam makes with the longitudinal axis for the linear ion chain , @xmath13 is the quantized local displacement of the @xmath8th ion about its equilibrium position and @xmath14 is the atomic lowering operator between the upper and lower atomic states @xmath15 and @xmath16 separated by frequency @xmath17 .",
    "we assume the equilibrium position of the @xmath8th ion is located at a node of the standing wave laser beam , we have used the rotating wave approximation to describe the interaction between the laser and the ion . in the lamb - dicke limit , terms of order @xmath18 have been neglected since the displacement of the ion is much less than the wavelength of light . in an experiment",
    "the @xmath19 is a quadrupole transition and is driven by a raman process .",
    "thus @xmath9 is an effective rabi frequency for this process",
    ".    equation ( [ 1 ] ) could also be regarded as a discretised representation for the interaction of a scalar field , @xmath20 , and a local detector , with transition frequency @xmath21 , where @xmath22 for some discretisation length @xmath23 .",
    "in such an interpretation the interaction eq.([1 ] is equivalent to the unruh model of a particle detector@xcite , with only two internal energy levels .",
    "note that the detector can be turned on and off through the dependance on the external laser field in @xmath9 , a somewhat unusual feature for field quanta detectors .",
    "another unusual feature of this detector is that the transition frequency of the detector , @xmath24 can be varied by tuning the external laser .",
    "conventional detectors would have a fixed transition frequency .",
    "this latter feature will enable us to define different kinds of phonon detectors .    the local displacement of the @xmath8th ion , @xmath13 ,",
    "can be expanded in terms of creation and annihilation operators for _ global _ normal modes ( phonons ) of the @xmath25-ion system @xmath26 by @xcite _",

    "_ m(t)_x(t ) where we have defined the operator @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "this hamiltonian describes the coupling between the two level electronic transition ( the detector ) and the vibrational degrees of freedom whenever the external laser is turned on ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "note that we do not make any assumptions at this stage about the relative size of @xmath21 and @xmath27 .",
    "we wish to keep @xmath21 as a free parameter which may be varied to define different kinds of phonon detectors . in analogy with the unruh detector model",
    ", the field operator @xmath13 represents the scalar field at the position @xmath42 and time @xmath43 , @xmath44 . in physical terms",
    "this is the displacement of the @xmath8th ion as a function of time .",
    "it is worth noting an important difference between this model and the usual treatment of a particle detector . in the case of a usual detector the frequency term , @xmath21 ,",
    "would be strictly positive thus defining the positive and negative frequency components of the dipole @xmath45 . in",
    ", the parameter @xmath21 can be positive or negative so we can not simply refer to positive or negative frequency components in absolute terms .",
    "however the operators @xmath45 will retain their usual definition as raising and lowering operators .    in the case that @xmath46 , the laser is detuned below the atomic transition , which we refer to as red detuning .",
    "we can resonantly excite so called red sidband transitions when @xmath47 .",
    "near such a resonance ( @xmath48 ) we can make the rotating wave approximation and describe the interaction by the hamiltonian @xmath49 this describes the usual jaynes - cummings model of a two level system interacting with a bosonic degree of freedom . in physical terms",
    "it describes a raman process in which one laser photon and one trap phonon are absorbed to excite the atom ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "a phonon detector defined this way would respond to the normally ordered moments of the phonon field amplitude .    in the case that @xmath50 , the laser is detuned above the atomic transition , which we will refer to as blue detuning",
    ". the resonant term for the fisrt blue sideband is then given by @xmath51 again this is a raman process in which the atom is excited by the absorption of one laser photon and the _ emission _ of one phonon ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "considered as a phonon counter this would correspond to a detector that responded to anti - normally ordered moments of the phonon field amplitude .    using laser cooling techniques it is possible to cool the system very nearly to the ground state of the vibrational degrees of freedom . in reality",
    "this becomes more difficult as the number of ions , and thus normal modes increases .",
    "however for our purposes even one ion would suffice . in current experiments",
    "the cooling is sufficiently efficient to reach the ground state with probability 0.999@xcite .",
    "we thus assume an initial state of the form , ( 0)|= |g|0 _ where the initial vibrational state is a tensor product of the ground states of each of the normal modes , @xmath52    we will exponentially chirp the trap frequency up or down such that ( t ) = e^t with @xmath0 the chirp rate and focus our laser on the first ion ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "for a constant trap frequency the phonon annihilation operator satisfies the usual uncoupled mode equation @xmath54 with solution @xmath55 , @xmath56 which was used in . for an chirped trap frequency given by between an initial time @xmath57 and final time @xmath43",
    ", the phonon mode now satisfies the following equation of motion , with solution _",
    "p(t ) = -_p e^t _ p(t)_p(t ) = ( e^t_0 ) ( - e^t ) _ p(t_0 ) .",
    "where we consider the chirp - up case first ( with the chirp down case discussed subsequently ) .",
    "we now suppose that the coupling to the detector is turned on at the same time as the frequency modulation is turned on , and turned off at the same time as the frequency modulation is turned off .",
    "this is a rather different scenario to the usual discussion of the unruh - davies effect in which the detector is always coupled to the field and continuously accelerated , ie the red shift frequency modulation is always on .",
    "we are interested in the probability @xmath58 for the excitation of the @xmath8th ion from the ground state to all excited states of detector and field for a detector turned on at @xmath59 and turned off at @xmath60 .",
    "the detector in our case has only one excited state .",
    "we let the excited states of the vibrational degree of freedom be represented by a complete orthonormal basis @xmath61 .",
    "the total excitation probability is then @xcite p_m(t , t_0)=^2_t_0^tdt_t_0^t dt ",
    "e^i(t-t)g(t,t  ) where the field correlation function is defined as @xmath62 with the field now given by @xmath63 and we have neglected the phase factor arising from the initial time as it does not contribute to the correlation function . substituting this result into eq.([cor ] ) , p_m(t , t_0)=^2_p=1^n|i_p(t , t_0)|^2 where the integral is i_p(t , t_0 ) _ t_0^t dt e^t e^ ( e^t ) . with no loss of generality we may now set @xmath64 .",
    "we first consider the case @xmath46 , which is the red - sideband case .",
    "our objective is to calculate the excitation probability for the two level system near the red sideband transition which we label @xmath65 .    to evaluate this integral we first change to dimensionless time , @xmath66 , so that i_p(t , t_0 ) = _ 0^t d e^a e^b e^ . where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "next we define the constant @xmath69 @xmath70 it then seems sensible to make the new change of variable @xmath71 so that the integral becomes @xmath72    in an experiment one needs to vary @xmath21 near the red or blue sideband , so we expect that @xmath21 and @xmath27 are of the same order .",
    "we now consider the limit in which @xmath73 for all the normal modes . in this limit @xmath74",
    ", the integral does not depend much on @xmath69 , so we extend the lower limit of the integral to infinity . furthermore we suppose the time over which the detector and modulation are on is such that @xmath75 , in which case the integral does not vary much with @xmath3 . in that case we can extend the upper limit of the integral to infinity , so that @xmath76 changing the variable of integration to @xmath77 we obtain an expression for @xmath78 with arbitrary limits as i_p & = & _ 0^dy y^ia-1e^iy + & = & ( ia)e^-a/2[ip2 ] if we now use the identity @xmath79 $ ] for real @xmath80 @xcite we see that |i_p|^2= inserting this into we can write @xmath81 in the suggestive form p_m^r= _ p=1^n where we have defined the unruh temperature as k_bt . has the analogous form to a thermal spectrum at temperature @xmath3 as seen by a uniformly accelerated observer moving through a particle - free inertial vacuum .",
    "the `` thermal '' form of the probability is independent of the phonon frequencies @xmath27 since we have taken the upper limit @xmath43 to infinity .",
    "the last summation expression is just a numerical factor , which can be computed @xcite , or dropped in the case of a single ion in the trap .",
    "the analogy with the unruh effect @xcite for a uniformly accelerated observer in minkowski space can be seen as follows . as discussed in @xcite the chirping of the trap frequencies",
    "can be considered as arising from the the modification of the usual minkowski plane wave @xmath82 due to the motion of the accelerated observer .",
    "for an observer moving at constant velocity @xmath83 in minkowski space , a lorentz transformation ( lt ) of the phase @xmath84 viz @xmath85 and @xmath86 with the rapidity defined by @xmath87 , simply transforms it to @xmath88 which merely produces the constant doppler shifted frequencies in the new frame @xmath89 . for an accelerated observer",
    ", one has to perform a time dependent lt at each instant to the comoving frame that is instantaneously at rest with respect to the accelerated observer .",
    "the orbit of the accelerated ( rindler ) observer as described by an inertial minkowski observer is given by the rindler transformation @xmath90 and @xmath91 where @xmath2 is the constant uniform acceleration .",
    "under this transformation , the rindler observer experiences phase of the minkowski plane wave @xmath92 as transformed to @xmath93 .",

    "the perceived thermal temperature is defined from the only other frequency that can be formed from the rindler observers accelerated motion , @xmath95 .",
    "thus we get the usual unruh temperature defined by @xmath96 . in our ion trap analogy ,",
    "the role of the acceleration frequency @xmath95 is played by the trap expansion rate @xmath0 .    , ( b ) blue side band @xmath97 . the unruh effect takes place on the red sideband .",
    "we obtain an _ anti - normally ordered _",
    "unruh effect if we tune to the blue side band .",
    ", width=384,height=288 ]        it is important to note that in order to obtain the planck factor @xmath98 in , indicative of a bose - einstein ( be ) thermal distribution and the signature of the unruh effect , we made crucial use of a positive detuning @xmath99 , corresponding to a red sideband detuning in and .",
    "this resulted in the factor @xmath100 that appears in @xmath78 in . dividing the square of this factor into the @xmath101 function appearing in the denominator of @xmath102 , resulting from the term @xmath103 , produces the signature be thermal distribution function .    if on the other hand , we had instead chosen @xmath104 corresponding to a negative detuning to the blue side band , the previous factor would become @xmath105 . dividing",

    "unruh effect since the vibrational excitation from the ground to the excited state takes place by an absorption of a photon and an emission of a phonon to the electronic state @xmath106 as depicted in , i.e. by a term such as @xmath107 , see eq.([blue ] ) .",
    "as discussed earlier , such a detector responds to the anti - normally ordered moments of the phonon field amplitude .",

    "this limit corresponds to a fixed trap frequency @xmath29 for which we get no excitation as described above .",
    "the above @xmath108 limiting cases can also be understood as follows . for a constant trap frequency @xmath112",

    "@xmath118 we do not obtain a contribution from the delta function . here the resonant portion of the hamiltonian gives rise to the usual jaynes - cummings type interaction eq.([red ] ) , which permits transitions of the form @xmath119 . with an initial motional ground state with @xmath116",
    "such transitions are not possible . however , in writing down we have dropped the non - resonant anti - normally ordered terms .",

    "we can also give an unruh analogy interpretation of the zero contribution to the delta function @xmath120 in .",

    "an inertial detector would have a response function proportional to @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the energy of the detected particle and @xmath123 represents the atomic transition frequency producing the particle to be detected @xcite . since the detector only responds to positive energies @xmath124 , the contribution from the delta function @xmath121 is zero , which simply states that an inertial detector moving through the minkowski vacuum would detect no particle production .",

    "the main point for experimental purposes is that we only need to take finite limits of the order @xmath147 and @xmath148 to approximate the full unruh case , @xmath137 as shown in .     and @xmath149 , @xmath150 with @xmath151 as the abscissa and @xmath152 as the ordinate for various values of @xmath153 ; red curve @xmath154 , green curve @xmath155 , blue curve @xmath156 .",
