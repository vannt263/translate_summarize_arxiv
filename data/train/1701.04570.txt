    ", a series of measures are proposed to quantify the degree of quantum non - markovianity @xcite . in despite of distinct forms of those measures , non - markovian open quantum systems can be basically characterized via their capability to gain back information previously lost due to decoherence @xcite .    besides the reduced dynamics of open systems , the exchange of energy between the open system and its environment also draw a great deal of attention during recent years ( see @xcite and references therein ) . noting the energy transfer properties are closely related to the dynamical characteristics of open systems , a natural question about the signature of quantum non - markovianity in energy transfer processes arises . recently ,",
    "a qualitative connection between an energy backflow obtained in the full counting statistic formalism and the non - markovianity measured by the trace distance @xcite is built in the spin - boson model @xcite . however , an independent qualitative study @xcite demonstrated that the backflow of the trace distance did not necessarily correlate with the energy backflow in the spin - boson model based on the energy current obtained from the definition of work via the power operator @xcite .",
    "such a behavior is also found in the quantum brownian motion by utilizing the gaussian interferometric power as a non - markovianity measure @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a quantitative study addressing the role of non - markovianity in the energy transfer process is still absent , explicit and analytical connections between the non - markovianity and dynamics of energy transfer are called for in order to make conclusive statements .    in this paper , among the different criteria and measures that quantify quantum non - markovianity @xcite , we focus on the one which utilizes the symmetric logarithmic derivative quantum fisher information ( sld - qfi ) flow as the fingerprint @xcite . as a promising measure , the sld - qfi flow coincides with the time derivative of the trace distance in exact solvable models @xcite .",
    "however , the sld - qfi scheme only needs an optimal input state instead of optimal state pairs in obtaining the trace distance @xcite .",

    ", the relation is built on the rotating - wave - approximation ( rwa ) , benchmarks against the quasiadiabatic propagator path integral ( quapi ) shows that our theory is reliable in the weak coupling regime .",

    "no energy backflow occurs and the energy current always flow out of the system even in the non - markovian regime .",

    "<S> we explore signatures of the non - markovianity in the time - resolved energy transfer processes for quantum open systems . focusing on typical systems such as the exact solvable damped jaynes - cummings model and the general spin - boson model , we establish quantitative links between the time - resolved energy current and the symmetric logarithmic derivative quantum fisher information ( sld - qfi ) flow , one of measures quantifying the non - markovianity , within the framework of non - markovian master equations in time - local forms . </S>",
    "<S> we find in the damped jaynes - cummings model that the sld - qfi backflow from the reservoir to the system always correlates with an energy backflow , thus we can directly witness the non - markovianity from the dynamics of the energy current . in the spin - boson model , </S>",
    "<S> the relation is built on the rotating - wave approximation , calibrated against exact numerical results , and proven reliable in the weak coupling regime . from the relation , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that whether the non - markovianity guarantees the occurrence of an energy backflow depends on the bath spectral function . for the ohmic and sub - ohmic cases , </S>",
    "<S> we show that no energy backflow occurs and the energy current always flow out of the system even in the non - markovian regime . while in the super - ohmic case </S>",
    "<S> , we observe that the non - markovian dynamics can induce an energy backflow . </S>"
