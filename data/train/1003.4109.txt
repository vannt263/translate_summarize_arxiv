    "atomic nuclei display a variety of different equilibrium shapes  spherical , axially deformed , shapes that are soft with respect to triaxial deformations . in most cases the transitions between different shapes in isotopic or isotonic sequences are gradual , and reflect the underlying modifications of single - nucleon shell structure and interactions between valence nucleons . in a number of cases , however , with the addition or subtraction of only few nucleons one finds experimental signatures of abrupt changes in observables that characterize ground - state nuclear shapes . in the last decade",
    "the concept of quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) has successfully been applied and investigated , both experimentally and theoretically , in equilibrium shape changes of nuclei @xcite .",
    "the two best studied classes of nuclear shape phase transitions correspond to a second - order qpt between spherical and @xmath0-soft shapes @xcite , and a first - order qpt between spherical and axially deformed shapes @xcite .",
    "most theoretical studies of qpt in nuclei have been based on model specific hamiltonians that by construction describe shape changes , i.e. a phase transition is accessed by variation of a control parameter explicitly built into the hamiltonian .",
    "for instance , a qpt can be described in the geometric framework in terms of a bohr hamiltonian for shape variables , and related to the concept of critical symmetries that provide parameter independent predictions for excitation spectra and electric quadrupole ( e2 ) transition rates for nuclei at the phase transition point .",
    "analytic solutions of the eigenvalue problem at the critical point are associated with zeros of special functions .",
    "alternatively , in the algebraic approach different shapes coincide with particular dynamic symmetries of some algebraic structure , and a qpt may occur when these symmetries are broken in a specific way .",
    "an example of the latter approach is the framework of the interacting - boson model ( ibm ) @xcite and its various extensions .",
    "more recently a number of studies appeared that attempt a fully microscopic description of shape qpt starting from nucleonic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "an approach in terms of explicit nucleonic degrees of freedom is particularly important because the physical control parameter in a nuclear qpt is the actual number of nucleons . in a series of studies @xcite we investigated nuclear qpt in the region",
    "@xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 with @xmath5 , using a microscopic approach based on constrained self - consistent relativistic mean - field calculations of potential energy surfaces . since a quantitative analysis of qpt must go beyond a simple mean - field level , i.e. one must be able to calculate ratios of excitation energies and electromagnetic transition rates , in ref .",
    "@xcite the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) was used to perform configuration mixing of angular - momentum and particle - number projected relativistic wave functions restricted to axial symmetry .",
    "this approach was extended in @xcite , where collective excitation spectra and transition probabilities were calculated starting from a five - dimensional hamiltonian for quadrupole vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom , with parameters determined by constrained mean - field calculations for triaxial shapes , i.e. including both @xmath6 and @xmath0 deformations .",
    "the results reproduced available data , and have shown that there is an abrupt change of structure at @xmath7 that can approximately be characterized by the x(5 ) analytic solution @xcite at the critical point of the first - order quantum phase transition between spherical and axially deformed shapes . as a function of the physical control parameter ",
    "the number of nucleons , energy gaps between the ground state and the excited vibrational states with zero angular momentum , isomer shifts , and the monopole transition strength , exhibit sharp discontinuities at neutron number @xmath7 , characteristic of a first - order quantum phase transition .",
    "are the remarkable results for x(5)-like shape phase transitions in the mass region @xmath8 @xcite somewhat accidental ?",
    "can the same universal energy density functional describe other types of shape phase transitions , and in different regions of the chart of nuclides ?",
    "to answer these questions we apply the same model to the study of @xmath0-soft shapes in ba and xe nuclei in the mass @xmath1 region , where evidence has been reported for a second - order qpt between spherical and @xmath0-soft shapes .",
    "this is a phase transition in one degree of freedom  the axial deformation @xmath6 and , in the ibm language , represents a transition between the @xmath9 and @xmath10 dynamical symmetries in the limit of large boson number .",
    "the critical point of phase transition can also be related to a dynamical symmetry : in this case e(5 ) @xcite , and the experimental realization of this critical - point symmetry was first identified in the spectrum of @xmath11ba @xcite .",
    "the model is based on constrained self - consistent relativistic mean - field calculations for triaxial shapes , i.e. including both @xmath6 and @xmath0 deformations .",
    "the resulting self - consistent solutions : single - particle wave functions , occupation probabilities , and quasiparticle energies that correspond to each point on the binding energy surface , are used to calculate the parameters that determine the collective hamiltonian : three mass parameters , three moments of inertia , and the zero - point energy corrections , as functions of the deformations @xmath6 and @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the diagonalization of the hamiltonian yields the excitation energies and collective wave functions that are used to calculate observables .",
    "no attempt is made to tune the model or the parameters to this particular type of shape transition or mass region .",
    "as in our previous studies of x(5)-like transitions @xcite , the relativistic functional pc - f1 ( point - coupling lagrangian )  @xcite is used in the particle - hole channel , and a density - independent @xmath12-force is the effective interaction in the particle - particle channel , with pairing correlations treated in the bcs approximation .",
    "our analysis starts with the self - consistent relativistic mean - field plus bcs calculation of quadrupole energy surfaces of ba and xe isotopes .",
    "the map of the energy surface as function of the quadrupole deformation is obtained by imposing constraints on the axial and triaxial mass quadrupole moments .",
    "the method of quadratic constraints uses an unrestricted variation of the function @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the total energy , and @xmath17 denotes the expectation value of the mass quadrupole operators : @xmath18 @xmath19 is the constrained value of the multipole moment , and @xmath20 the corresponding stiffness constant  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ pes - ba ] we display the rmf+bcs triaxial quadrupole binding energy maps of the even - even @xmath21ba in the @xmath22 plane ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "all energies are normalized with respect to the binding energy of the absolute minimum , and the contours join points on the surface with the same energy ( in mev ) . for each nucleus in the corresponding inset we plot the axial projection of the binding energy for oblate ( negative @xmath6 ) and prolate ( positive @xmath6 ) deformations .",
    "the corresponding energy maps of the even - even @xmath24xe isotopes are shown in fig .",
    "[ pes - xe ] . both for ba and xe , these plots illustrate the rapid transition from spherical shapes near the @xmath25 closed - shell , to @xmath0-soft energy surfaces for lighter isotopes . starting from almost perfect spherical shapes in @xmath26ba and @xmath11xe ,",
    "the decrease in neutron number induces quadrupole deformations . in the axial plots we notice that the potentials become less stiff in @xmath6 and that two minima develop , one prolate and one oblate , at almost the same energy , and separated by a low spherical barrier",
    "however , the 3-dimensional energy maps show that the spherical barriers are concentrated around @xmath27 and , therefore , rather than two separate minima , the potentials display continuous @xmath0-soft minima that extend from prolate to oblate shapes .    of particular interest in the present analysis",
    "are the nuclei which have been identified as possible candidates for a shape phase transition that can be characterized by the e(5 ) dynamical symmetry @xcite .",

    "the microscopic binding energy curve @xmath32 of @xmath11ba ( fig .",
    "[ pes - ba ] ) displays a shape that is almost symmetric with respect to @xmath33 .",
    "one notices a relatively flat bottom between @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( the oblate configuration is only @xmath36 mev above the prolate minimum ) , and the potential is rather stiff for @xmath37 .",

    "this additional scale parameter is necessary because of the well known fact that the inglis - belyaev ( ib ) formula ( [ inglis - belyaev ] ) predicts effective moments of inertia that are considerably smaller than empirical values . following the minimal prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite , the moments of inertia that parameterize the collective hamiltonian can be simply related to the ib values : @xmath89 , where @xmath90 denotes the generic deformation parameter , and @xmath91 is a constant that can be determined in a comparison with data @xcite .",

    "the excitation spectrum of the collective hamiltonian determined by the pc - f1 density functional is in good agreement with the available data .",

    "this also explains the strong repulsion between the theoretical second and third @xmath96 states .",
    "it is interesting to compare the pc - f1 excitation spectrum with the e(5 ) level scheme that corresponds to @xmath11ba ( right panel in fig .",
    "[ spect-134ba ] ) .",

    "the two excited @xmath96 states in the e(5 ) model belong to different @xmath104-multiplets , and only @xmath109 transitions are allowed .",
    "the microscopic collective hamiltonian , on the other hand , breaks the symmetry and this is reflected both in the decay pattern and the excitation energy of the @xmath98 state .",
    "another difference between the pc - f1 and e(5 ) spectrum is the transition @xmath95 , for which the e(5 ) model predicts the same b(e2 ) value as for @xmath112 .",

    "however , as we have already noted , this result is not in agreement with data which show that the transition @xmath95 is in fact stronger than @xmath112 .",

    "i.e. the one that predominantly decays to @xmath117 , is systematically calculated at considerably higher excitation energy compared to the experimental position of the two excited @xmath96 levels . in @xmath11ba and @xmath83xe ,",
    "for which data on absolute e2 transition strengths are available , it is the first excited @xmath96 state that predominantly decays to @xmath117 , contrary to the results of our calculation .",
    "one reason for this discrepancy , of course , could be the particular choice of the energy density functional and/or the treatment of pairing correlations , but also the approximation used in the calculation of the mass parameters ( vibrational inertial functions ) . in the current version of the model the moments of inertia are calculated from the inglis - belyaev formula ( eq .  ( [ inglis - belyaev ] ) ) .",
    "these moments of inertia do not include the thouless - valatin dynamical rearrangement contributions and , therefore , are systematically smaller than the empirical values .",
    "however , as shown in several studies @xcite , the thouless - valatin corrections are almost independent of deformation , and the effective moments of inertia to be used in the collective hamiltonian can simply be obtained by renormalizing the inglis - belyaev values by a constant factor , characteristic for a given nucleus .",
    "the situation is considerably more complicated in the case of mass parameters @xcite , for which there are no simple estimates of the thouless - valatin correction , especially for nuclei with @xmath0-soft potential energy surfaces .",
    "some authors @xcite argue that , to approximately take into account the thouless - valatin correction , all inertial functions , not only the moments of inertia , should be rescaled by a constant multiplicative factor .",
    "another effect that is not included in our model is the coupling of nuclear shape oscillations with pairing vibrations , i.e. vibrations of the pairing density .",
    "a number of studies have shown that excited @xmath96 states are very sensitive to the coupling between these modes . for the ba and xe isotopes , in particular , the effect of coupling between pairing vibrations and axial quadrupole vibrations was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , using collective hamiltonians based on a microscopic nilsson single - particle hamiltonian with pairing forces and a long - range residual interaction .",
    "it was shown that the coupling between the pairing and quadrupole modes has a very pronounced effect on the lowest excited @xmath96 states , lowering their excitation energies by @xmath136 , in much closer agreement to data . in an even earlier study of collective states in xe and ba isotopes @xcite , based on the general 5-dimensional bohr hamiltonian ,",
    "this coupling was not taken into account explicitly , but rather it was simulated by a reduction of the pairing strengths of @xmath137 . even though the resulting pairing interaction is somewhat unphysical",
    ", i.e. it gives proton and neutron gaps that are too small , the resulting excitation energies of the lowest @xmath96 states are @xmath136 lower , in better agreement with experiment .",
    "the present study , however , employs exactly the same model that was used in our previous analysis of spherical to axially - deformed shape transitions , the mass parameters are calculated in the cranking approximation eqs .",

    "in fact , we have found that the position of the first excited @xmath96 state in our calculation ( the one that predominantly decays to @xmath116 ) is sensitive to the value of the mass parameter @xmath50 , the excitation energy of the third @xmath96 state ( predominantly decaying to @xmath117 ) displays a very strong dependence on @xmath52 , and the mixing of the two excited @xmath96 states is controlled by @xmath51 .",
    "for instance , by decreasing @xmath51 , i.e. by reducing the coupling between @xmath6 and @xmath0 vibrational degrees of freedom , the mixing between @xmath138 and @xmath134 decreases and the resulting spectrum is even closer to the e(5 ) level scheme . by increasing the value of @xmath52 one finds a rapid decrease of the excited energy of the calculated @xmath134 , and eventually the two excited @xmath96 state cross , in better agreement with available data for @xmath11ba and @xmath83xe .",
    "the only other effect on the calculated spectrum is a much smaller lowering of the sequence : @xmath117 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , again in agreement with experiment . in the case of @xmath83xe , for instance",

    "ground - state properties , excitation energies , quadrupole and monopole transition matrix elements for yrast levels up to @xmath140 and the lowest yrare levels , have been calculated for even - even particle - stable nuclei with proton numbers @xmath141 to @xmath142 and neutron number @xmath143 . except for the use of a different effective interaction in the particle - hole and particle - particle channels , the model of ref .",

    "@xcite goes beyond the simple inglis - belyaev formula used in this study , and explicitly includes the thouless - valatin dynamical rearrangement contributions .",

    "@xcite has considered the low - energy collective quadrupole spectrum of @xmath144sm .",

    "more generally , the calculated spectral properties of @xmath145 even - even nuclei have demonstrated the predictive power of the quadrupole collective hamiltonian model based on a microscopic effective interaction . a problem common to both studies , i.e. to the global survey of ref .",
    "@xcite and the specific calculation of transitional ba and xe isotopes reported in this work , are the excitation energies of excited @xmath96 states that are systematically calculated too high compared with data .",

    "@xcite it has been suggested that the energies of excited @xmath96 states could be improved by including the thouless - valatin dynamical rearrangement contributions in the calculation of the quadrupole mass parameters , and by extending the model space to include two - quasiparticle components in the wave functions .",
    "the recently developed implementation for the solution of the five - dimensional collective hamiltonian for quadrupole vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom , with parameters determined by constrained self - consistent relativistic mean - field calculations for triaxial shapes , has been applied to the study of @xmath0-soft shapes in ba and xe nuclei in the mass @xmath1 region . this microscopic approach had previously been used to describe spherical to axially deformed shape transitions in the mass @xmath8 region , and the results have shown there is an abrupt change of structure at @xmath7 that can approximately be characterized by the x(5 ) analytic solution at the critical point of a first - order quantum phase transition . in this sense",
    "the present analysis represents a natural extension of our previous studies @xcite , to a region of nuclei where evidence has been reported for a second - order qpt between spherical and @xmath0-soft shapes , with the critical point of phase transition characterized by the e(5 ) dynamical symmetry . without any modification of the model hamiltonian , of the treatment of pairing correlations , or the parameters of the effective interactions in the particle - hole and particle - particle channels , we have been able to describe the rapid transition between spherical and @xmath0-soft shapes in ba and xe isotopes .",
    "the results reproduce the characteristic evolution of excitation spectra and e2 transition probabilities , and a good agreement with available data is obtained . in specific nuclei , e.g. @xmath11ba and @xmath44xe , the calculated triaxial quadrupole binding energy surfaces are rather flat in an extended interval of the axial deformation parameter @xmath6 , and almost independent of the @xmath0-deformation . for the ground states of these nuclei one",

    "the fact that the same microscopic model describes both first- and second - order qpt in different mass regions is , in our opinion , an interesting result which illustrates the importance of microscopic studies of qpt starting from nucleonic degrees of freedom . a quantitative comparison with experimental spectra , particularly with very recent data for @xmath83xe , points to some intrinsic problems in the description of excited @xmath96 states and clearly indicates that one must go beyond the simple cranking approximation for the model mass parameters ( vibrational inertial functions ) , or even extend the model by explicitly taking into account the coupling of nuclear shape oscillations with pairing vibrations .",
