    "the observed slsne can be classified into two categories , viz .",
    "type ic slsne and type iin slsne .",
    "type iin slsne show strong signs of circumstellar interaction .",
    "type ic slsne , on the other hand , are usually assumed to be energized by newborn millisecond magnetars during the core collapse of the progenitors @xciteni and magnetars @xcite . ] .",
    "other channels to form millisecond magnetars include accretion - induced collapse of white dwarfs ( aic ; * ? ? ?",

    "aic and nsm are of particular interest here because aic ejects an outflow with mass @xmath2 @xcite , while nsm results in ejecta with masses @xmath3 and velocity @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "such low masses of the ejecta can be accelerated to quasi - relativistic speed by the magnetar .",
    "the magnetar - powered optical transients , e.g. a fraction of slsne that are believed to be powered by magnetars , are usually modeled based on the analytical solution developed by @xcite , who assumed that the kinetic energy of the sne is constant and the ejecta of the sne are dense enough that the photosphere does not recede . this simple solution works pretty well in reproducing the observational data except for some cases which render excess in theoretical light curves compared with the observational data in late times @xcite . to rescue the magnetar model ,",
    "it is arguably suggested @xcite that the energy injected from the rotating magnetar could leak away from the ejecta based on the observation that the spin - down luminosity of the magnetar could be dominated by high energy gamma rays @xcite .",
    "the analytical model usually treats with the ejecta as a whole , even if the sn goes into a nebular phase in late times .",
    "@xcite considered the photospheric recession resulting from the ion recombination . in their model the ejecta interior of the photosphere are continuously heated by the radioactive decay of @xmath5ni and @xmath5co while the ejecta exterior are cool and transparent that emanates no radiation . in this paper",
    "we consider the photospheric recession and treat the ejecta within and outside of the photosphere separately so that the sn can transit from the photospheric phase into a nebular phase smoothly .",
    "our aim at present is not to elaborate a full - fledged model of the nebular phase of the sn .",
    "but rather , as a first step , we would like to demonstrate how the nebular emission takes over the photospheric emission . in future",
    "a more elaborated model can be developed based on this model .    a significant fraction of the magnetar s rotational energy can be converted into the sn kinetic energy . as a result , the acceleration of the sn by the magnetar should be taken into consideration . in section [ sec : sn ] we present our model , taking into account the dynamic evolution , photospheric recession , nebular phase takeover . in the extreme case for very light ejecta , the sn can be boosted to a quasi - relativistic speed .",
    "we present the light curves and temperature evolution in section [ sec : rel ] in the relativistic case .",
    "finally , discussions and conclusions are given in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we assume a constant density and homologous expansion of the sn .",

    "first of all , because the magnetar can deposit a significant fraction of its rotational energy as the kinetic energy of the sn , the expansion velocity of the sn is actually not a constant , as is usually assumed in the previous analytical models .",
    "however , since the magnetar dissipates its rotational energy in a timescale @xmath88 the boost of the sn kinetic energy by magnetar can not be observed given the fact that the typical sne are detected several days after their explosion when the magnetars have already exhausted their rotational energy .",
    "the sn light curve rises to its maximum roughly in the effective diffusion timescale @xmath55 . to clearly observe the acceleration of the sn by magnetar , the condition @xmath89",
    "should be guaranteed , which leads to the following upper bound on the magnetar dipole field strength@xmath90where the typical parameters @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 are adopted . in the above expression",
    "we assume that the initial explosion energy of the sn , @xmath94 , is larger than the energy deposited as kinetic energy by the magnetar .",
    "this is however not always true .",
    "if we assume that a fraction @xmath95 of the rotational energy of the magnetar can be deposited as the kinetic energy of the sn , the magnetar along can accelerate the sn to a velocity@xmath96where @xmath97 is the moment of inertia of the magnetar .",
    "obviously , for less massive ejecta , the sn can be accelerated to high speed by a rapidly rotating magnetar .",
    "provided that the kinetic energy of the sn is dominantly attributed to the magnetar , to fulfil the condition @xmath98 , we have@xmath99we find that equations @xmath100 and @xmath101 give similar upper bounds on the dipole magnetic field .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lc - v](a ) we show the effect of the kinetic energy injection by the magnetar , along with the accumulative fraction of the total rotational energy of the magnetar deposited as the kinetic energy of the sn . in figure",

    ", we set the asymptotic velocity in our model to equal to the constant velocity in the usual model .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig : lc - v](a ) that the kinetic injection affects the rising part of the light curve , with a luminosity dimmer than the constant velocity model .",
    "figure [ fig : lc - v](a ) also shows that at the maximum @xmath104 of the rotational energy of the magnetar is deposited as the kinetic energy of the sn , in rough agreement with that determined by woosley10 .",
    "but ultimately this fraction can be as high as @xmath105 . in figure",
    "[ fig : lc - v](a ) the parameters are adopted so that the condition @xmath106 is fulfilled . in the opposite extreme ,",
    "i.e. @xmath107 , however , as can be seen from figure [ fig : lc - v](b ) , as high as @xmath108 of the rotational energy of the magnetar is converted into the kinetic energy of the sn . in conclusion",
    ", we expect that in a magnetar - powered sn , @xmath109 of the rotational energy of the magnetar can be converted into the kinetic energy of the sn .    in this model because @xmath110  is no longer",
    "a constant , the effective diffusion time @xmath55  is not well defined . however , since the variation of @xmath110  is slow , we can still think of @xmath111  as the rising time of the light curve .",
    "please note that the rising times of the light curves in the two panels of figure [ fig : lc - v ] are different even other parameters are the same except the dipole magnetic field @xmath17 .",
    "this is because the magnetar with a stronger magnetic field can accelerate the ejecta to higher speed , reducing the effective diffusion time @xmath55 . in short ,",
    "a magnetar with a short spin - down time deposits its rotational energy mainly as the kinetic energy of the sn , while the one with a long spin - down time deposits its rotational energy mainly as the thermal radiation of the sn .",
    "we therefore conclude that for an sn to become an slsn , the magnetar must be fast rotating with a relatively weak dipole magnetic field .    , @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "in this figure we shows the bolometric luminosity ( solid line ) , luminosity due to the photospheric emission ( dot - dot - dashed line ) , luminosity due to the nebula ( dot - dashed line ) , and the magnetar luminosity ( dashed line ) . here the energy leakage of the magnetar is taken into account .",

    "a particular demonstration of the model in reproducing the observational data is exemplified in the inset .",
    "we see that at early times the photospheric emission completely dominates , whereas at late times the photospheric emission and nebular emission conspire to follow the input power of the magnetar . in this calculation",

    "the effective temperature is a weighted average of the photospheric emission and nebular emission , given by    @xmath124    the above averaging scheme is motivated to pick out the temperature of the dominant emission component and at the same time make a smooth transition even if one of the components goes to zero .",
    "in this section we assume that the ejecta are light enough , i.e. @xmath125 , so that the magnetar can accelerate it to quasi - relativistic speed . assuming the formation of a rapidly rotating magnetar following the double neutron star merger , @xcite studied the merger remnant emission , dubbed merger - nova , powered by a magnetar .",
    "however , owing to some simplified assumptions underlining the calculations by yu13 , a revisit of this problem is necessary .    the merger - nova emission , in the comoving frame ,",

    "are taken to be @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 , in accordance with the numerical simulations @xcite .    in the comoving frame",
    ", the radioactive heating rate , @xmath146 , of the @xmath147-process material can be well approximated according to @xcite@xmath148where @xmath149 is the heating efficiency , and @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 , @xmath153 the time measured in comoving frame .",
    "the heating efficiency in equation @xmath154 is set as @xmath155 to account for the energy carried away by neutrinos and the energy leak caused by gamma - ray diffusion @xcite .",
    "for the typical values of the ejecta mass , the radioactive heating rate is negligible compared with the spin - down luminosity of the magnetar .    the photospheric luminosity and flux density in the observer frame is given by @xmath156 and@xmath157respectively .",
    "here @xmath158 is the distance of the merger - nova .    in figure",
    "[ fig : luminosity ] we show the lorentz factor and bolometric luminosities .",
    "we find that when considering the gamma - ray leakage , the ejecta can only be accelerated to sub - relativistic speed .",
    "the lorentz factor experiences an increase and then a decline before the time when @xmath159 .",
    "this is because the merger - nova luminosity varies from a value below to a value above the magnetar input luminosity .",
    "the deceleration of the ejecta at time @xmath160 is due to the impact of the ambient medium . in the calculations in this section , the model parameters are @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath127 , @xmath161 .",
    "figure [ fig : te ] depicts evolution of the photospheric radius @xmath162 and the effective temperature @xmath163 , weighted average expressed in @xmath164 , in the observer frame . because the ejecta are barely relativistic , the effective temperature in the comoving frame would be very close to the observed temperature .",
    "it is found that the temperature does not monotonically decline after the first rapid rise .",
    "the second rise occurs just before the photosphere disappears .",
    "this bebaviour of the temperature evolution can be understood by comparing figures fig : sn - lc and [ fig : luminosity ] .",
    "figure [ fig : sn - lc ] shows that long before @xmath122 , the nebular emission dominates over the photospheric emission , which is in sharp contrast to the situation in figure [ fig : luminosity ] . in the quasi - relativistic case",
    ", the photospheric emission dominates over the nebular emission before @xmath122 , and therefore the observed temperature reflects the photospheric emission . in this case",
    "the photosphere recedes so rapidly that the inner hot part is exposed to the observer .    in figure",
    "[ fig : photo - emission ] we show the observed flux densities of the merger - nova emission ( before @xmath165 ) and forward shock emission ( after @xmath165 ) at optical , uv , and x - ray bands . the merger - nova emission before the time when @xmath122 comes dominantly from photosphere , thereafter the emission comes from the nebula .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the x - ray emission from merger - nova is negligible .",
    "in this paper , we develop a model for the magnetar - powered optical transients to treat the photospheric and nebular emission separately based on @xcite . we also consider the quasi - relativistic merger - nova .",
    "we evaluate the acceleration of the slsne by the magnetar and find that this effect can be observed most clearly in the case of @xmath166 , where @xmath167 of the magnetar rotational energy is converted to the kinetic energy of the slsne . in the other extreme case ,",
    "i.e. @xmath168 , up to @xmath169 of the magnetar energy can be deposited as the sn kinetic energy .",
    "it is found that the slsne transit from photospheric to nebular phase smoothly . when @xmath122 the nebular luminosity is equal to the instantaneous energy input rate of the magnetar .",
    "this is true for both sub - relativistic slsne ( figure [ fig : sn - lc ] ) and quasi - relativistic merger - novae ( figure [ fig : luminosity ] ) .",
    "nevertheless we note that in this model we do not account for changes in ionization balance and hence in opacity , which could in principle affect the nebular transition .",
    "a comparison of figures [ fig : sn - t ] and [ fig : te ] indicates that the temperature evolution could be slightly complicated if the optical transient acquires a quasi - relativistic speed . in this case",
    ", the photosphere recedes rapidly that the effective temperature could rise before the photosphere disappears .    from equations @xmath170 and @xmath171",
    "we see that for a sub - relativistic slsn , at the maximum of the light curve , the sn luminosity equals the instantaneous energy input rate @xcite , under the assumption @xmath172 at the peak luminosity .",
    "it is clear here , because of the photospheric recession , that this law is only a good approximation . assuming that the photospheric luminosity dominates over the nebular luminosity at the peak time @xmath0 , equations @xmath173 and @xmath137 give@xmath174 .\\]]because @xmath175 , at the peak time @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath176 , the above equation gives@xmath177by assumption , @xmath178 , @xmath179 , in general , we have @xmath180where @xmath1 is the time when the sn luminosity equals the instantaneous energy input rate .",
    "this modification to the law @xmath181 can be understood as follows .",
    "although the photospheric recession reduces the emitting surface , it increases the surface temperature as well .",
    "these two effects result in a progressive enhancement of the photospheric luminosity , i.e. the delay of @xmath0 relative to @xmath1 .",
    "if the optical transient gains a relativistic speed , doppler transformation between the comoving frame and the observer frame may affect the above law . in the comoving frame , by definition , one have@xmath182 in the observer frame , one have@xmath183because we always have @xmath184 @xmath185 , by demanding @xmath181 , i.e. @xmath186 , the condition@xmath187could be fulfilled as long as the dynamic evolution of the optical transient is appropriate .",
    "the above inference indicates that it is even possible that @xmath188 under relativistic motion .",
    "figure fig : luminosity shows that the light curve of the merger - nova considered here is in the normal case , i.e. @xmath189 , where to be seen clearly , we depicts the horizontal axis in logarithmic scale .",
    "this is because the doppler factor is nearly unity during the evolution of the merger - nova .    for completeness",
    ", we mention that nonhomologous expansion , e.g. shock breakout , can also modify the approximate law @xmath181 .",
    "nonhomologous expansion adds the following effective source term @xcite@xmath190to the energy conservation equation@xmath191here the dimensionless function @xmath192  defines the shape of the density distribution within the sn ejecta . in equation @xmath193  the first term on the left - hand side stands for the thermal energy , while the second term on the same side comes from the volume expansion . the first term on the right - hand side stands for the heating rate , the second term is the sn luminosity .",
    "we leave the discussion about the link between the nonhomologous heating term and the sn luminosity to the appendix .",
    "the term @xmath194 has a cooling effect near the ejecta surface and a heating effect in the inner region @xcite . when the photosphere recedes inwards , the cooling effect near the surface disappears but the heating effect in the inner region remains , resulting in an enhanced luminosity relative to the homologous expansion .",
    "shock breakout usually manifests itself as a luminosity spike , while the disappearance of the cooling effect of the surface acts as a bump in the light curve .    as an analytical model",
    ", it can be benefited from a comparison with the numerical simulations .",
    "figure [ fig : kasen ] is a comparison between this analytical model and the one - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of kasen10 .",
    "it can be seen that the luminosity calculated by the analytical model is higher than simulations .",
    "this is the result of the diffusion approximation inherent in the analytical solution . as shown in this figure , increasing the dipole magnetic field ( and thence reducing the spin - down time of the magnetar ) of the magnetar results in a light curve of dimmer and short - lived .",
    "this again reinforces our conclusion that a magnetar with short spin - down timescale converts its rotational energy mostly into the kinetic energy of the sn , while the one with long spin - down timescale converts its rotational energy into the radiation of the sn .",
    "an slsn is powered by a fast rotating ( relatively ) weakly magnetized magnetar .",
    "this stimulates us to speculate that the hypernovae , i.e. those sne with kinetic energy @xmath195 ,  could be powered by millisecond magnetars with much stronger dipole magnetic field .",
    "the analytical model presented in this paper predicts a slow transition to nebular phase and a flat velocity curve .",
    "this is in immediate accord with the well known observational fact that slsne are usually slowly evolved compared to the normal type ic sne ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as a demonstration , figure [ fig : demo ] shows the light curves ( the observational data are taken from @xcite and @xcite ) and velocity curves of slsne 2013dg and 2011ke . it can be seen that the model curves are in good agreement with the observational data .",
    "the flatness of the velocity curves of slsne is the result of two factors .",
    "first of all , slsne tend to be more massive than normal type ic sne ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the magnetar , however , is another factor to make the velocity curve flat because the magnetar keeps accelerate the ejecta .    if it were not the effect of the magnetar , the photospheric velocity would keep declining because of the recession of the photosphere .",
    "the acceleration of the ejecta by magnetar partially compensates the photospheric recession .",
    "this fact may serve as a very interesting evidence in favor of the magnetar model against other alternative models .",
    "it can be tentatively concluded that the slow evolution to the nebular phase and the flat velocity curve of slsne are the result of the large ejecta mass and the existence of magnetar inherent to slsne .",
    "this gives justification for making more detailed modelling of the magnetar - powered slsne .    in this model",
    "the photospheric velocity first increases rapidly and then declines slowly .",
    "the inset of figure [ fig : sn - v ] , however , shows that the photospheric velocity of sn2010gx declines more rapidly than our model .",
    "this could be remedied by introducing an envelope as done by @xcite .",
    "one issue we have deferred to discuss is the form of the energy flux from the magnetar . in its simplest form",
    "we just assume that the rotational energy of the magnetar is absorbed by the ejecta in the form of pure photons .",
    "observation of pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , indicates that the pwne are usually a mixture of electron / positron pairs and magnetic ( poynting ) flux .",
    "if the ejecta are massive enough , the rotational energy of the magnetar will eventually be completely absorbed , regardless of the existence of electron pairs or poynting flux .",
    "if , however , the ejecta is less massive , e.g. @xmath196 , in the extreme case that the energy flux from the magnetar is completely lepton dominated , the outflow ejected by the double neutron star merger could be rapidly accelerated to relativistic speed and a strong reverse shock develops within the ejecta @xcite .    in most cases",
    "the pwne behave neither in the poynting - flux extreme , nor in the lepton - flux extreme , but rather lie in between .",
    "we therefore expect that the optical transients with mass as low as @xmath197 would render their light curves as a trade - off of that studied in this paper and that given by @xcite and wang15,wang16 , which we will study in the following papers .",

    "we therefore conclude that to include the nonhomologous expansion effect , one just needs to add @xmath223 into the source term @xmath224 . one caveat , however , is that by approximating @xmath225 a constant , we actually assume that the heating rate distribution @xmath221 is proportional to the temperature distribution @xmath226 , which is usually a good approximation .",

    "<S> millisecond magnetars can be formed via several channels : core - collapse of massive stars , accretion - induced collapse of white dwarfs ( wds ) , double wd mergers , double neutron star ( ns ) mergers , and wd - ns mergers . because the mass of ejecta from these channels could be quite different , </S>",
    "<S> their light curves are also expected to be diverse . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the dynamic evolution of optical transients powered by millisecond magnetars . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the magnetar with short spin - down timescale converts its rotational energy mostly into the kinetic energy of the transient , while the energy of a magnetar with long spin - down timescale goes into radiation of the transient . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to speculate that hypernovae could be powered by magnetars with short spin - down timescales . at late times </S>",
    "<S> the optical transients will gradually evolve into a nebular phase because of the photospheric recession . </S>",
    "<S> we treat the photosphere and nebula separately because their radiation mechanisms are different </S>",
    "<S> . in some cases the ejecta could be light enough that the magnetar can accelerate it to a relativistic speed . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the peak luminosity of a supernova ( sn ) occurs when the luminosity is equal to the instantaneous energy input rate , as shown by arnett ( 1979 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that photospheric recession and relativistic motion can modify this law . </S>",
    "<S> the photospheric recession always leads to a delay of the peak time @xmath0 relative to the time @xmath1 at which the sn luminosity equals the instantaneous energy input rate . </S>",
