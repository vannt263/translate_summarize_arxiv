    "<S> we show how a simple calculation leads to the surprising result that an excited two - level atom moving through vacuum sees a tiny friction force of first order in  @xmath0 . at first sight </S>",
    "<S> this seems to be in obvious contradiction to other calculations showing that the interaction with the vacuum does not change the velocity of an atom . </S>",
    "<S> it is yet more surprising that this change in the atom s momentum turns out to be a necessary result of energy and momentum conservation in special relativity .    </S>",
    "<S> atoms moving through and interacting with electromagnetic fields experience velocity dependent forces . for laser fields </S>",
    "<S> this results in famous ( sub- ) doppler cooling schemes which form the foundation of modern atom - optical experiments  @xcite while much earlier works by einstein and hopf already showed how such friction forces are necessary to discuss thermal radiation fields self - consistently  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but these considerations also showed that no such forces will arise from the interaction with the vacuum .    here , </S>",
    "<S> however , we report how the simplest quantum - optical model , an initially excited atom moving through the vacuum , appears to be in contradiction with these results . </S>",
    "<S> our starting point is the usual , non - relativistic atom - field hamiltonian in the dipole approximation including the rntgen term from which we first re - derive the decay rate from the excited state . </S>",
    "<S> based on this well established framework we then go on to calculate the canonical and kinetic momenta of the atom and see that these are not constant in time , indicating the presence of a net force .    </S>",
    "<S> such a force emanating from the vacuum is , of course , highly suspicious . </S>",
    "<S> even more suspicious is the fact that this force has the form of a friction , that is , the change in momentum is proportional to the initial momentum . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that there is no such force in the atom s rest frame and a co - moving observer will stay next to the particle while any other observer will see that the atom decelerates . </S>",
    "<S> such a result would contradict the principle of relativity .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that only a proper consideration of energy and momentum conservation can solve this puzzle and that the momentum of the atom does change while its velocity remains constant .    for the sake of clarity and brevity </S>",
    "<S> we describe the atom as a two - level system , its dynamics will be calculated using time - dependent perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> this model is described by a hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 describes the kinetic energy and dynamics of the atom with internal states @xmath3 and @xmath4 as well as the quantised electromagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the last term includes sums over all modes  @xmath5 and over the two polarisation states @xmath6 while @xmath7 is the usual annihilation operator for a photon in mode  @xmath5 and polarisation  @xmath8 .    </S>",

    "<S> using the fields from equ .   and @xmath17 we can rewrite the interaction hamiltonian from equ .   in the rotating wave approximation , @xmath18 with @xmath19 and a momentum - dependent coupling term </S>",

    "<S> describes the coupling between a moving electric dipole and a magnetic field  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its presence leads to corrections ensuring the correct decay pattern of a moving atom  @xcite and to a subtle difference between the canonical momentum @xmath22 and the kinetic momentum @xmath25 where  @xcite @xmath26    a simple perturbative treatment suffices to demonstrate the problem . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we consider the evolution of an initially excited atom in an eigenstate of the canonical momentum operator in vacuum , i.e.  @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling  @xmath28 initiates transitions to the ground state with reduced momentum and a photon of momentum  @xmath29 , i.e.  @xmath30 with @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> these are , of course , eigenstates of @xmath32 with energies @xmath33 and @xmath34 , separated by @xmath35 , @xmath36    the state at time  @xmath37 can thus be described by @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> these amplitudes evolve as    [ eq:_cegdot ] @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the eigenvalue of @xmath21 given in equ .  . </S>",
    "<S> we can integrate these to find that @xmath43 is @xmath44 here we truncated @xmath45 and used @xmath46 for @xmath47 . using these approximations </S>",
    "<S> we quickly obtain the decay rate @xmath48 , @xmath49 which is what we would expect from fermi s golden rule  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the delta function includes both the doppler shift  @xmath50 as well as the recoil shift  @xmath51  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a calculation of the total decay rate to first order @xmath52 is given in the appendix .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown  @xcite that this expression for the decay rate ensures that the directional decay rate obtained after performing the sum over polarisations @xmath6 and the frequency integral is consistent with a first - order approximation of the emission pattern of a moving dipole .    </S>",
    "<S> after calculating the decay rate it is a straightforward task to calculate the expectation value for the canonical momentum @xmath53 . as @xmath22 commutes with @xmath32 </S>",
    "<S> we see that @xmath54 such that @xmath55 or @xmath56 comparing this to @xmath57 as given in equ .   </S>",
    "<S> we see that the momentum change of the atom is simply given by the probability to emit a photon into a mode  @xmath5 multiplied by the momentum of such a photon , @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> let us stress again that the directional decay rate given in equ </S>",
    "<S> .   is consistent with a first - order approximation of the emission pattern of a moving dipole  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result for the momentum change is thus required by momentum conservation .    as mentioned in equ .   </S>",
    "<S> kinetic and canonical momenta are different in the presence of the rntgen term . </S>",
    "<S> this difference is given by a term @xmath58 with @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> in the notation of equ .   this is @xmath60 .    to see the difference in the change of these momenta </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the time derivative of @xmath61 this derivative will consist of three terms ( cf .  </S>",
    "<S> equs .  ): </S>",
    "<S> the first is proportional to @xmath62 , it thus goes beyond our perturbation theory ; the second is @xmath63 , its imaginary part is thus zero ; hence the only surviving term is @xmath64 we recognise that this expression is quite similar to what we had in equ .  , but here we get @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> this is an integral involving a delta function multiplied by its argument , @xmath66 thus _ vanishes _ and the change of our kinetic momentum is equal to the change in canonical momentum given by equ .  .    </S>",
    "<S> calculating a value for @xmath67 from equ .   </S>",
    "<S> involves rather straightforward , albeit lengthy , integration . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous works  @xcite we do not assume an infinitely heavy atom here , but keep recoil terms to first order of  @xmath68 as these appear in  @xmath69 and the delta function . </S>",
    "<S> more details on this calculation are given in the appendix . </S>",
    "<S> in the end we find @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the total decay rate from equ .  . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the change in momentum is proportional to the atom s decay rate , the recoil energy and the initial momentum of the atom .    </S>",
    "<S> the momentum change given in equ .   </S>",
    "<S> is the main result and topic of this work . </S>",
    "<S> it shows that an atom spontaneously emitting a photon changes its average momentum at a rate proportional to its initial momentum  @xmath72 . as mentioned in the introduction , such friction terms in the interaction between light and matter </S>",
    "<S> are not unusual . but </S>",
    "<S> here this friction comes from the interaction with vacuum and we see that there is no force in the atom s rest frame where @xmath73  .    </S>",
    "<S> .   seems to indicate that an observer co - moving with the initially excited atom will ( on average ) observe no change in the atom s motional state , as the photons are emitted in a random direction and the recoil adds up to zero . </S>",
    "<S> but any other observer will see that the atom changes its initial momentum @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we note that observers in two different reference frames record different physical behaviour , a clear contradiction to the principle of relativity . </S>",
    "<S> note that this is different from the unruh - davis effect which applies to particles initially _ accelerating _ through the vacuum  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> of course we know that the physics described by the hamiltonian @xmath75 will not include all relativistic effects , but yet we expect its results to be correct to first order in  @xmath0 , especially after we included the rntgen term which ensures that the emission pattern on the right hand side of equ .   </S>",
    "<S> is consistent with a moving dipole .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also of concern that the physics involved in this derivation was not at all complicated . </S>",
    "<S> of course we made some assumptions , especially the dipole and rotating wave approximations and the truncation of the time - dependent perturbation theory , but these simplifications are standard textbook quantum optics  @xcite and should not lead to obviously wrong physical results . </S>",
    "<S> another simplification was to put the atom into a momentum eigenstate , but our arguments are repeatable for more physical initial states which are superpositions of these .    </S>",
    "<S> the resolution to this puzzle comes when we recognise that , in general , a change in ( kinetic ) momentum @xmath76 as given in equ .   </S>",
    "<S> is not only related to a change in velocity , but also to a change in mass as @xmath77 ( this relationship holds also in special relativity , at least to first order @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> further , we know that the total mass of an atom ( here described as a dipole ) is not just the sum of its constituents ( electron and nucleus ) , but it is reduced by the internal binding energy @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> this mass defect is , of course , well known , but it is usually discussed in connection with particle and nuclear physics where the binding energies are considerably larger than in atomic physics .    in our case the decaying atom increases its binding energy by an amount  @xmath79 , thus changing its mass at a rate @xmath57 as @xmath80 such a change in mass is consistent with a change in momentum , @xmath81 , if the velocity remains unchanged , @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> the change in momentum of a decaying atom can therefore be explained by a change in its mass - energy while its _ velocity remains constant_.    this also resolves the issue of two observers in different reference frames who now both see the same physics : an atom with constant velocity emitting a photon and thus losing energy at a rate @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> this loss of energy is then also connected to a change in inertia and momentum .    </S>",
    "<S> but this resolution brings up another question : how did the changing mass enter our description of an atom interacting with an electromagnetic field ? </S>",
    "<S> it is certainly _ not included _ in the hamiltonian which can be derived by explicitly setting @xmath84  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can also directly calculate the change in the particle s velocity as @xmath85/\\hbar^2 $ ] to find a nonzero acceleration because @xmath86 , cf .  </S>",
    "<S> equ .  . </S>",
    "<S> a proper distinction between a change in momentum and an acceleration thus requires the derivation of a new atomic hamiltonian which also includes a dynamical mass - energy term coupled to  @xmath22 .    by virtue of the rntgen term </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian used here properly describes the physics involved in the emission of the photon and this is also what enters the calculation of @xmath87 in equ .  . </S>",
    "<S> in the following short calculation we use a simple example to show that the proper description of the emission process is sufficient to derive the friction term .     a movable two - way emitter sending photons of equal energy to the left and to the right . </S>",
    "<S> an observer measuring the frequencies can use the doppler shift to measure the relative velocity and will infer that the momentum of the device changed during the emission process . ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:_towwaytorch ] shows a battery - powered device emitting a pair of photons with the same frequency in two opposite directions . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath88 [ @xmath89 denotes the total mass - energy of the apparatus before [ after ] the emission process we see that its internal energy changes as @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> the motion of the emitter remains constant by design as both photons carry equal momentum @xmath91 in opposite directions .    </S>",
    "<S> let this apparatus now move at a speed  @xmath92 relative to two perfect detectors each measuring the frequency of one photon . due to the doppler shift </S>",
    "<S> these frequencies are different as @xmath93 and @xmath94 with @xmath95 . using the available data the observer will construct the following relations of energy - momentum conservation    [ eq:_twotorchexample_enmom2 ] @xmath96    such that @xmath97 and @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> we thus see that the observer would calculate a change in the momentum of the apparatus even though there is no change in its velocity  .    </S>",
    "<S> this simple example illustrates how the doppler effect directly links the change in internal energy during an emission process to a friction - like change in the momentum . </S>",
    "<S> note again that although this momentum change is real it is not connected to an acceleration , the motion of the object remains unchanged . in our case of the decaying atom the presence of the rntgen term in equ </S>",
    "<S> .   led to a correct emission pattern in equ .   which in turn was all we needed to calculate the momentum change of the atom in equ .  . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations were thus similar to the energy - momentum balance in equs .   and also gave the same result @xmath99 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> we have shown how a simple calculation of an excited two - level atom in vacuum results in a momentum change proportional to the initial velocity of the atom , cf .  equ .  . </S>",
    "<S> if this momentum change were linked to a true deceleration of the atom , it would be in contradiction to the principle of relativity . </S>",
    "<S> this riddle is solved , however , by recognising the change in the internal energy ( mass ) of the atom as the source of the momentum change . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the momentum of the atom changes , but its velocity remains constant .    </S>",
    "<S> let us stress that this effect is not , intrinsically , a quantum optical phenomenon and is also not limited to the special case of a decaying atom in vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> rather it is a general phenomenon occurring whenever a particle changes its internal energy , for instance , due to stimulated absorption and emission or , more subtle , due to stark or zeeman shifts . in these cases with external fields and resulting ( friction ) forces this effect is concealed within the stronger interactions leading to a true acceleration .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to nuclear or particle physics , the energies involved in atom optics are far below the atom s rest mass . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore not surprising that this subtle difference between momentum change and acceleration has not been measured yet . </S>",
    "<S> ion traps have been used to measure nuclear masses to a precision of  @xmath100  @xcite which is roughly three orders of magnitude more than the mass defect due to atomic binding energies , @xmath101 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we would like to point out again that the current hamiltonian describing a dipole in an external field does not include a dynamic mass . </S>",
    "<S> although the calculation of the momentum change  @xmath102 bypasses this insufficiency , the result obtained for the actual acceleration  @xmath103 is flawed . </S>",
    "<S> this calls for a small correction of the atomic hamiltonian to include the coupling between the momentum and a change in internal energy which will be the topic of a future work .    </S>",
    "<S> answering the question in the title : we have shown that , yes , a decaying atom sees a force resembling friction . </S>",
    "<S> but this force is a change in momentum due to a change in internal mass - energy and is not connected to decelerated motion .    </S>",
