    "the interference channel ( ic ) models the situation where several independent transmitters communicate with their corresponding receivers simultaneously over a common spectrum . due to the shared medium",
    ", each receiver suffers from interferences caused by the transmissions of other transceiver pairs .",
    "the research of ic was initiated by shannon  @xcite and the channel was first thoroughly studied by ahlswede  @xcite . later , carleial  @xcite established an improved achievable rate region by applying the superposition coding scheme . in  @xcite , han and",
    "kobayashi obtained the best achievable rate region known to date for the general ic by utilizing simultaneous decoding at the receivers .",
    "recently , this rate region has been re - characterized with superposition encoding for the sub - messages  @xcite . however , the capacity region of the general ic is still an open problem  @xcite .",
    "the capacity region for the corresponding gaussian case is also unknown except for several special cases , such as the strong gaussian ic and the very strong gaussian ic  @xcite .",
    "in addition , sason  @xcite characterized the sum capacity for a special case of the gaussian ic called the degraded gaussian ic . for more general cases ,",
    "han - kobayashi region  @xcite is still the best achievable rate region known to date .",
    "however , for the general gaussian interference channel , the calculation of the han - kobayashi region bears high complexity .",
    "the authors in  @xcite proposed a simpler heuristic coding scheme , for which they set the private message power at both transmitters in a special way such that the interfered private signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) at each receiver is equal to @xmath0 .",
    "an upper bound on the capacity was also derived in  @xcite and it was shown that the gap between the heuristic lower bound and the capacity upper bound is less than one bit for both weak and mixed interference cases .",
    "many variations of the interference channel have also been studied , including the ic with feedback  @xcite and the ic with conferencing encoders / decoders  @xcite . here",
    ", we study another variation of the ic : the state - dependent two - user ic with state information non - causally known at both transmitters .",
    "this situation may arise in a multi - cell downlink communication scenario as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_example ] , where two interested cells are interfering with each other and the mobiles suffer from some common interference ( which can be from other neighboring cells and viewed as state ) non - causally known at both of the two base - stations via certain collaboration with the neighboring base - station .",
    "notably , communication over state - dependent channels has drawn lots of attentions due to its wide applications such as information embedding  @xcite and computer memories with defects  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding framework was also initiated by shannon in  @xcite , which established the capacity of a state - dependent discrete memoryless ( dm ) point - to - point channel with causal state information at the transmitter . in  @xcite ,",
    "gelfand and pinsker obtained the capacity for such a point - to - point case with the state information non - causally known at the transmitter .",
    "subsequently , costa  @xcite extended gelfand - pinsker coding to the state - dependent additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel , where the state is an additive zero - mean gaussian interference .",
    "this result is known as the dirty - paper coding ( dpc ) technique , which achieves the capacity as if there is no such an interference . for the multi - user case , extensions of the afore - mentioned schemes appeared in  @xcite for the multiple access channel ( mac ) , the broadcast channel , and the degraded gaussian relay channel , respectively .    in this paper , we study the state - dependent ic with state information non - causally known at the transmitters and develop two coding schemes , both of which jointly apply rate splitting and gelfand - pinsker coding . in the first coding scheme ,",
    "we deploy simultaneous encoding for the sub - messages , and in the second one , we deploy superposition encoding for the sub - messages .",
    "the associated achievable rate regions are derived based on the respective coding schemes .",
    "then we specialize the achievable rate region corresponding to the simultaneous encoding scheme in the gaussian case , where the common additive state is a zero - mean gaussian random variable .",
    "specifically , we introduce the notion of _ active interference cancellation _ , which generalizes dirty - paper coding by utilizing some transmitting power to partially cancel the common interference at both receivers .",
    "furthermore , we propose heuristic schemes for the strong gaussian ic , the mixed gaussian ic , and the weak gaussian ic with state information , respectively . for the strong gaussian ic with state information",
    ", the transmitters only send common messages and the dpc parameters are optimized for one of the two resulting macs . for the mixed gaussian ic with state information",
    ", one transmitter sends common message and the other one sends private message , with dpc parameters optimized only for one receiver . for the weak interference case , we apply rate splitting , set the private message power at both transmitters to have the interfered private snr at each receiver equal to @xmath0  @xcite , utilize sequential decoding , and optimize the dpc parameters for one of the macs .",
    "the time - sharing technique is applied in all the three cases to obtain enlarged achievable rate regions .",
    "numerical comparisons among the achievable rate regions and the capacity outer bound are also provided . for the strong and mixed interference cases ,",
    "we show that the active interference cancellation mechanism improves the performance significantly ; for the weak interference case , it is flexible power allocation instead of active interference cancellation that enlarges the achievable rate region significantly .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . the channel model and the definition of achievable rate region",
    "are presented in section [ sec_2 ] . in section [ sec_3 ] ,",
    "we provide two achievable rate regions for the discrete memoryless ic with state information non - causally known at both transmitters , based on the two different coding schemes , respectively . in section [ sec_4 ]",
    ", we discuss the gaussian case and present the main idea of active interference cancellation .",
    "the strong interference , mixed interference , and weak interference cases are studied in section [ sec_5 ] , [ sec_6 ] , and [ sec_7 ] , respectively . in section  [ sec_9 ] , numerical results comparing different inner bounds against the outer bound are given .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in section [ sec_conclusion ] .",
    "consider the interference channel as shown in fig .  [ fig_relay_channel_model ] , where two transmitters communicate with the corresponding receivers through a common medium that is dependent on state @xmath1 .",
    "the transmitters do not cooperate with each other ; however , they both know the state information @xmath1 non - causally , which is known to neither of the receivers . each receiver needs to decode the information from the corresponding transmitter .",
    "we use the following notations for the dm channel .",
    "the random variable is defined as @xmath2 with value @xmath3 in a finite set @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the probability mass function of @xmath2 on @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding sequences are denoted by @xmath6 with length @xmath7 .",
    "the state - dependent two - user interference channel is defined by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 are two input alphabet sets , @xmath10 are the corresponding output alphabet sets , @xmath11 is the state alphabet set , and @xmath12 is the conditional probability of @xmath13 given @xmath14 .",
    "the channel is assumed to be memoryless , i.e. , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the element index for each sequence .",
    "a @xmath17 code for the above channel consists of two independent message sets @xmath18 and @xmath19 , two encoders that respectively assign two codewords to messages @xmath20 and @xmath21 based on the non - causally known state information @xmath22 , and two decoders that respectively determine the estimated messages @xmath23 and @xmath24 or declare an error from the received sequences .",
    "the average probability of error is defined as : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is assumed to be uniformly distributed over @xmath27 .",
    "a rate pair @xmath28 of non - negative real values is achievable if there exists a sequence of @xmath17 codes with @xmath29 as @xmath30 .",
    "the set of all achievable rate pairs is defined as the capacity region .",
    "the gaussian counterpart of the previously defined dm channel is shown in fig . [ fig_channel_model ] , where two transmitters communicate with the corresponding receivers through a common channel that is dependent on state @xmath1 , which can be treated as a common interference .",
    "the corresponding signal structure can be described by the following channel input and output relationship : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the real link amplitude gain from the @xmath33th transmitter to the @xmath16th receiver , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the channel input and output , respectively , and @xmath36 is the zero - mean awgn noise with variance @xmath37 , for @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "both receivers also suffer from a zero - mean additive white gaussian interference @xmath1 with variance @xmath40 , which is non - causally known at both transmitters .",
    "note that for this awgn model , all the random variables are defined over the field of real numbers @xmath41 .    without loss of generality",
    ", we transform the signal model into the following standard form  @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 note that @xmath44 and @xmath45 have unit variance in and .",
    "we also impose the following power constraints on the channel inputs @xmath46 and @xmath47 : @xmath48",
    "in this section , we propose two new coding schemes for the dm interference channel with state information non - causally known at both transmitters and quantify the associated achievable rate regions . for both coding schemes , we jointly deploy rate splitting and gelfand - pinsker coding . specifically , in the first coding scheme , we use simultaneous encoding on the sub - messages , while in the second one we apply superposition encoding .",
    "now we introduce the following rate region achieved by the first coding scheme , which combines rate splitting and gelfand - pinsker coding .",
    "let us consider the auxiliary random variables @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , defined on arbitrary finite sets @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , respectively . the joint probability distribution of the above auxiliary random variables and the state variable @xmath1 is chosen to satisfy the form @xmath59 .",
    "moreover , for a given @xmath49 , we let the channel input @xmath60 be an arbitrary deterministic function of @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath1 .",
    "the achievable rate region of the simultaneous encoding scheme is given in the following theorem .",

    "furthermore , gelfand - pinsker coding is utilized to help both transmitters send the messages with the non - causal knowledge of the state information .",
    "specifically , transmitter @xmath33 finds the corresponding public codeword @xmath72 and the private codeword @xmath73 such that they are jointly typical with the state @xmath22 .",
    "then the transmitting codeword is constructed as a deterministic function of the public codeword @xmath72 , the private codeword @xmath73 , and the state @xmath22 . at the receiver side ,",
    "decoder @xmath33 tries to decode the corresponding messages from transmitter @xmath33 and the public message of the interfering transmitter .",
    "the rest follows by the usual error event grouping and error probability analysis .",
    "the auxiliary random variables in theorem  [ theorem_1 ] can be interpreted as follows : @xmath49 is the time - sharing random variable ; @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( @xmath68 or @xmath69 ) are the auxiliary random variables to carry the public and private messages at transmitter @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "it can be easily seen from the joint probability distribution that @xmath61 and @xmath62 are conditionally independent given @xmath49 and @xmath1 , which means that the public and private messages are encoded  simultaneously \" .",
    "an explicit description of the achievable rate region can be obtained by applying the fourier - motzkin algorithm  @xcite on our implicit description - , as shown in the next corollary .    for a fixed probability distribution @xmath63 ,",
    "let @xmath74 be the set of all non - negative rate pairs @xmath75 satisfying where @xmath76 then any rate pair @xmath77 is achievable for the dm interference channel with state information defined in section  [ sec_2 ] .",

    "similar to the auxiliary random variables in theorem  [ theorem_1 ] , in the following theorem , @xmath49 is also the time - sharing random variable ; @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( @xmath68 or @xmath69 ) are the auxiliary random variables to carry the public and private messages at transmitter @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the difference here is the joint probability distribution @xmath78 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are not conditionally independent given @xmath49 and @xmath1 .",
    "this also implies the notion of  superposition encoding \" .",
    "the achievable rate region of the superposition encoding scheme is given in the following theorem .",

    "the main difference here is that instead of simultaneous encoding , now the private message @xmath71 is superimposed on the public message @xmath70 for the @xmath33th transmitter , @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "in addition , gelfand - pinsker coding is utilized to help the transmitters send both public and private messages .",
    "it can be easily seen that the achievable rate region @xmath64 in theorem [ theorem_1 ] is a subset of @xmath80 , i.e. , @xmath83 .",
    "however , whether these two regions can be equivalent is still under investigation , which is motivated by the equivalence between the simultaneous encoding region and the superposition encoding region for the traditional ic  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present the corresponding achievable rate region for the gaussian ic with state information defined in section [ sec_2 ] .",
    "in addition to applying dirty paper coding and rate splitting , here we also introduce the idea of active interference cancellation , which allocates some source power to cancel the state effect at the receivers .      in the general gaussian interference channel , the simultaneous encoding over the sub - messages",
    "can be viewed as sending @xmath84 at the @xmath33th transmitter , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are independent and correspond to the public and private messages , respectively .",
    "correspondingly , for the gaussian ic with state information defined in section [ sec_2 ] , we focus on the coding scheme based on simultaneous encoding that was discussed in section  [ sec_3_simul ] .",
    "specifically , we apply dirty paper coding to both public and private parts , i.e. , we define the auxiliary variables as follows : @xmath87    in addition , we allow both transmitters to apply active interference cancellation by allocating a certain amount of power to send counter - phase signals against the known interference @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are active cancellation parameters .",
