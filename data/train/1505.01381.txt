    "this system is shown to fulfill an energy conservation law , and reduces to a previously studied system @xcite in the classical limit .",
    "a systematic study of the transition from classical to quantum behavior then reveals several new features .",
    "this include a quantum modification of the bounce frequency , a new condition for the quantum suppression of the nonlinear regime and the discovery that bounce - like oscillations can take place even in the absence of trapped particles .",
    "similar to most cases , the conditions needed for quantum effects to be important in our problem include a high plasma density and a modest plasma temperature .",

    "it is then safe to exclude exchange effects @xcite .",
    "in fact , the condition @xmath9 is often used also to disregard the particle dispersive quantum effects included in eq .

    "an advantage with the above system ( [ norm-1])-([norm-4 ] ) is that solving the equations numerically we can follow the evolution taking time - steps that are larger than the inverse plasma frequency , as the equations contain only the slow time - scales , as opposed to the original wigner - moyal equation ( [ wigner-2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we only need to solve the equations in a small part of the velocity space , close to the resonance , which also makes eqs .",
    "( [ norm-1])-([norm-4 ] ) easier to solve numerically .",
    "finally , the spatial dependence is solved for analytically in ( [ norm-1])-([norm-4 ] ) , which also simplifies the numerics .",
    "before we start with a numerical study , let us first make a few comments regarding the linear theory . as the equation stands , making a linearization of eqs .",
    "( [ norm-1])-([norm-4 ] ) completely removes the quantity @xmath82 which encodes the quantum properties .",
    "( [ norm-2 ] ) can then be integrated according to@xmath94for certain initial conditions @xmath95 the integrals in eqs .",

    "whenever these inequalities hold we can also use @xmath100 which is the reason the finite difference is replaced by the classical expression containg a derivative in eq .",
    "( [ lin - damping ] ) . since @xmath89",
    ", @xmath101 varies on a much shorter scale length in velocity space as compared to @xmath102 , we note that a similar approximation can not be applied for these quantities .",
    "we stress that in a general scenario ( e.g. for a beam - plasma system or for the regime @xmath103 ) the approximation ( [ lin - approx ] ) may give an incorrect description of linear landau damping , but in our case the linear regime is classical to a good approximation .",
    "it shold also be noted that the evolution of @xmath104 exhibits phase mixing due to the factors @xmath105 ( see also fig . 1 of the next section ) whether or not the linear damping expression contains a finite difference or a derivative .",
    "hence the quantum influence on the regime of linear landau damping tend to be relatively modest also when the approximation ( [ lin - approx ] ) is avoided .",

    "( [ norm-2 ] ) leads to phase mixing , i.e. the development of increasingly small scales in velocity space .",
    "it should be noted that quantum effects does not counteract this behavior for small amplitudes.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    .",
    "when this becomes comparable to @xmath109 only a few states are trapped , and quantum mechanical effects become important to describe the evolution.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the system ( [ norm-1])-([norm-4 ] ) has been studied numerically using a staggered leapfrog finite differencing technique .",
    "two classes of initial conditions have been used . in the first case @xmath110 and @xmath111 @xmath112 ( for @xmath78 ) .",
    "this has the advantage that the wigner function approaches the value outside the resonance reegion for @xmath113 .",
    "the other choice is to put also @xmath114 such that the initial wigner function is identically zero in the resonant region .",
    "it turns out that the evolution is almost completely independent of this difference in initial conditions , if the initial amplitude @xmath115 is increased in the latter case such as to make the initial energy equal in the two cases . in what follows all numerical results will refer to the case with @xmath116.picking a small initial amplitude @xmath117 the system shows a damping @xmath96 as expected due to the normalization of the time variable . as noted in the previous section the evolution is independent of the quantum parameter @xmath118 , which is related to the assumption @xmath59 that was made in the derivation .",
    "1 compares the real part of @xmath104 for different times .",
    "the evolution shows the evolution towards smaller scale lengths in velocity space due to phase mixing .",
    "when nonlinearities come into play this  process plays part in increasing the relative importance of quantum effects in wave - particle interaction , as mathematically the system ( [ norm-1])-([norm-4 ] ) differs from the classical limit once the scale length of @xmath60 in velocity space is smaller than @xmath118 .",
    "however , a more physical way to understand why quantum effects become important more easily in the nonlinear regime than in the linear regime is shown in fig .",
    "2 . here as a rough approximation",
    "we have described the discrete eigenstates of trapped particles as that of an harmonic oscillator where the eigenfrequency is the bounce frequency @xmath119 .",
    "naturally this is rather crude , as the electrostatic potential is only harmonic for the lowest energy states ( if at all ) , and moreover the potential can vary dynamically to a smaller or larger degree depending on the parameters of the problem . still the simple picture in fig 2 is sufficient to identify one of the key parameters @xmath120 , which is the ratio of the trapping potential over the energy quanta of trapped particles , @xmath121 .",
    "if the initial values have @xmath122 the evolution of the wave amplitude @xmath123 is classical to a good approximation . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath124 decreases towards unity the discrete energy states of the trapped particles will modify the evolution significantly .",
    "in terms of our normalized variables we note that the quantum trapping parameter can be written as @xmath125 . for @xmath126",
    "we will not have trapped particles . however , as we will see below the close coupling between the existence of trapped particles and nonlinear evolution that holds in the classical regime does not generally apply in the quantum regime .     for initial amplitude @xmath127 and @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "the value @xmath132 gives a classical evolution to a good approximation , whereas for @xmath133 the nonlinearities are almost completely suppressed by the quantum effects.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     for @xmath133 .",
    "the inital amplitudes are @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath131 and @xmath136.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    next we investigate how the value of the quantum parameter @xmath118 affects the evolution of @xmath123 in the nonlinear regime . keeping the normalized initial amplitude equal to @xmath134 ( which means that the ( initial ) bounce frequency is @xmath137 ) , we follow the evolution up to @xmath138 for various values of @xmath118 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "3 . for @xmath139 the evolution of the wave amplitude",
    "more or less coincides with the classical case .",
    "this means that an initial drop in amplitude is followed by oscillations with a frequency of the order of the bounce frequency @xmath119 .",
    "as @xmath140 is not a constant , it is no surprise that these oscillations are slightly irregular .",
    "this result is in agreement with previous works on the classical case , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "when the quantum parameter @xmath118 is increased , more of the wave energy is converted to the particles ( the initial amplitude drop is larger ) and the period of the amplitude oscillations become longer . eventually when @xmath141 the initial amplitude drop is so large such that the evolution has become almost completely linear . keeping @xmath142 and instead varying the initial amplitude , the evolution @xmath123 for various values of @xmath115",
    "is shown in fig 4 .",
    "the same qualitative features as in fig 3 can be seen .",
    "that is the amplitude oscillation gets a lower frequency with decreasing @xmath115 , and the initial drop in wave amplitude is larger , until eventually for small enough initial amplitude the nonlinearities are suppressed and we obtain linear damping .",
    "a more quantitative analysis based on figs 3 and 4 reveals that amplitude oscillations have a frequency @xmath143 classically @xmath144 is small and @xmath145 for @xmath146 . when the quantum velocity shift @xmath82becomes comparable to the characteristic scale of @xmath104 the frequency of the amplitude oscillations decreases . still the amplitude may oscillate nonlinearly even for large @xmath118 and @xmath147 ( in the regime of no trapped particles ) .",
    "the transition to linear evolution occur when the expression for @xmath148 becomes begative , in which case the amplitude oscillation frequency decreases too fast for the nonlinear oscillations to get started .",
    "next we look closer on some of the details of the numerical results .",
    "as shown in figs 3 and 4 , the evolution of the wave amplitude changes rather smoothly with @xmath118 .",
    "however , the various harmonics of the wigner function @xmath60 is more sensitive to the change in @xmath118 .",
    "the discrete structure involving momentum changes @xmath149 can be seen directly in the wigner function , perhaps most clearly in @xmath89 . in a very rough sense",
    "there is a relation between the energy states displayed in fig . 2 and the momentum structure shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "as shown in fig 5 where @xmath150 is plotted in the classical and quantum mechanical regime , respectively , there is a very distinct difference between the quantum mechanical and classical regime . for the former case",
    "clear dips for @xmath151 and @xmath152 can be seen , as well as peaks for @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that a discrete structure in the momentum dependence can be seen even in the absence of trapped particles .",
    "another important aspect is the convergence in the sum over harmonics @xmath60 , which is much faster in the quantum regime .",
    "a comparison of the classical and quantum regime is displayed in fig .",
    "we see that the relative amount of energy in the third harmonic @xmath155 is changed dramatically when @xmath118 is changed from @xmath156 to @xmath129 .",
    "the convergence in the sum over the harmonics is determined by the trapping parameter @xmath124 . in the classical and nonlinear regime with @xmath122",
    "we need to include harmonics up to @xmath157 , or even more .",
    "besides the value of @xmath124 the number of harmonics needed depends on the degree of the nonlinearity and how long the evolution is followed . in the quantum regime when @xmath158 including up to @xmath159 is typically more than enough to get convergence .",
    "this applies even when @xmath160 and the evolution is strongly nonlinear . while the trapping parameter @xmath161 determines much of the properties of the wigner function in the resonant region , it is the parameter @xmath162=\\hat{\\phi}/(1+\\delta v_{q})$ ] that determines the degree of nonlinearity . in the nonlinear regime",
    "@xmath163  this parameter determines the frequency of the nonlinear amplitude oscillations , and we have @xmath164 . for small @xmath165 ( in practice @xmath166 )",
    "the evolution is linear to a very good approximation .",
    "the reason why @xmath165 determines the nonlinearity can be understood roughly as follows : a key time - scale is the time - scale @xmath167 for modifying the background distribution .",
    "classically this time - scale is set by the inverse bounce - frequency , i.e. we have @xmath168 @xmath169 .",
    "mathematically this simply reflects the fact that the coupling to @xmath89 and the higher harmonics @xmath60 is linear in the wave amplitude , as seen in eqs ( norm-2)-([norm-4 ] ) .",
    "when quantum effects enters the velocity derivative is replaced by a finite difference .",
    "classically when the scale lengths in velocity space increases ( cf fig .",
    "1 ) the magnitude of the nonlinear terms increases .",
    "however , the finite value of @xmath118 prevents the continuous increase of the nonlinear coupling , as is seen from eqs ( [ norm-2])-([norm-4 ] ) , and effectively the transition from classical to quantum regime correspond to a change @xmath170 .",
    "physically this means that the characteristic time for acceleration of particles increases when the minimum velocity change comes in steps of @xmath171 .  noting that @xmath172 for the nonlinear modifications of @xmath89 to occur faster than the linear damping explains the significance of the parameter @xmath173 .     shown for initial amplitude @xmath174 for @xmath128 ( lower panel ) and for @xmath175 ( upper panel ) .",
    "the discrete nature of the veloctiy dependence with peaks at discret values of @xmath176 is clear in the quantum regime .",
    "there is also a relation to the discrete energy states of fig .",
    "2 , since the discrete velocity structure disappears when there is a large number of trapped states , as seen in the lower panel .",
    "however , there is not a one - to - one correspondence between the energy states and the velocity structure .",
    "specifically the discrete structure of the velocity dependence can be present in the strong quantum regime when the particle trapping is absent due to quantum effects.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the results reported here are similar in some respects to the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the full wigner equation was solved numerically .",
    "it was then found that the nonlinear regime of landau damping was suppressed when @xmath177 .",
    "this is a rather extreme quantum regime , and our condition for suppressing the nonlinear regime ( essentially @xmath178 being negative ) which roughly gives @xmath179 is much easier to fulfill .",
    "the nmain reason for our relaxed quantum condition is that we have focused on a resonance in the tail of the distribution , where @xmath180 . in this case",
    "@xmath118 become comparable to the velocity scale length close to the resonance long before @xmath118 becomes comparable to the thermal ( or fermi ) velocity .",
    "thus we can investigate a regime where the wave - particle interaction is quantum mechanical , although the real part of the wave frequency is determined by the classical dispersion relation .",
    "by contrast , for a resonance in the bulk of the distribution , all quantum effects appear simultaneously .",
    "next we compare our results with those of ref .",
    "daligault-2014 , that has studied the initial evolution of the wave particle interaction .",
    "we note that that the comparison of the quantum time - scales @xmath181 with the classical bounce time @xmath182 @xmath183 made in @xcite is very similar to the discussion made above .",

    "@xcite notes that the condition @xmath184 @xmath182 implies the absence of trapped particles .",
    "however , since ref .",
    "@xcite only studies the initial evolution , the conclusion that the nonlinear regime is suppressed for @xmath185 suggested in that work is not accurate . using the notation of @xcite ,",
    "rather the condition for suppressing the nonlinear regime is @xmath186 , as explained above .",
    "much of the above features can be summarized in fig . 7 that shows the different regimes of landau damping plotted as a function of the nonlinearity parameter @xmath187 and the quantum parameter @xmath188 .",
    "the interesting part of the diagram is the nonlinear quantum regime @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "it should be noted that the condition for quantum suppression of the nonlinear amplitude oscillations given by ref .",
    "@xcite is the same condition that separates our region v from region vi ( i.e. the condition that controls the existence of trapped particles ) .",
    "interestingly , however , we find that the system can undergo nonlinear bounce - like oscillations even without trapped particles , and hence the region of quantum suppression ( region iv ) is determined by a distinct condition involving the quantum modified bounce frequency .",
    "it should be noted that the collisional influence can modify the different regimes to some extent .",
    "this will be discussed in some detail in the final section .",
    "a feature of fig . 4 not explained by the above discussion is the small but continuous decrease of wave energy seen for the highest amplitude in fig .",
    "4 . besides the amplitude oscillation there is a continuous decrease in @xmath191 for initial condition @xmath192 but not for @xmath193 . to understand this",
    "we must investigate how the energy of the particles in the resonance region is distributed among the harmonics .",
    "as described above the convergence is the sum over harmonics is fast for @xmath194 .",
    "@xmath195for the curves displayed in fig 4 only the one with @xmath192 has significant harmonic generation .",
    "for all the other curves the harmonics @xmath60 for @xmath196 is effectively not excited , and the two terms @xmath197 @xmath198 accounts for more than @xmath199 of the particle energy .",
    "however , due to the rapid phase mixing of @xmath200 for large @xmath118 , this harmonics does not return the particle energy to wave energy , but instead the second harmonic acts as a leakage of energy , not taking part in bounce - like oscillations .",
    "this can be contrasted against the oscillatory evolution of the energy of the third harmonic for @xmath201 which could be seen in fig .",
    "6 . to a small extent",
    "the continuous loss of wave energy to higher harmonics can be observed also for @xmath202 , but to a much smaller degree .",
    "this is illustrated in fig 8@xmath203 , where the relative energy content in the second harmonic @xmath204 is plotted for @xmath202 and for @xmath192 .",
    "as can be seen , by a comparison with fig .",
    "4 the continuous increase of energy in the second harmonic accounts rather well for the overall downward trend in wave energy .",
    "a similar mechanism in principle exists also for lower values of @xmath118 .",
    "however here it is much less effective .",
    "the reason is twofold .",
    "firstly , for lower @xmath118 the peaks of @xmath200 and higher harmonics occurs for a smaller velocity , and phase mixing is less effective . thus the energy of the higher harmonics can be returned back to lower harmonics more easily .",
    "secondly ,  for the same degree of nonlinearity ( same value of @xmath165 ) the trapping parameter is larger for smaller @xmath118 .",
    "hence a larger number of harmonics are excited for lower @xmath118 .",
    "this means that the highest harmonic excited takes a smaller proportion of the energy , in which case the leakage of energy is smaller . in practice , the details of the energy loss is likely to be determined by collisional effects , as very small scales in velocity space develops during the evolution @xcite .     for initial amplitude @xmath134 .",

    "region iv : quantum suppression of nonlinear bounce - like oscillations .",
    "region v : nonlinear regime with bounce - like oscillations in the absence of trapped particles region vi : region of trapped particles with quantum modified bounce oscillations .",
    "note that the same expression @xmath207 for the quantum modified amplitude oscillations apply in both region v and vi , scaledwidth=50.0% ]     for @xmath208 .",
    "the two curves are computed for initial amplitude @xmath209 and @xmath192 respectively.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "usually particle dispersive effects as accounted for by the wigner - moyal equation are assumed to be significant when the thermal de broglie length @xmath210 , or its counterpart for a degenerate plasma , @xmath211 ( where @xmath212 is the fermi velocity),@xmath213becomes comparable to the debye length @xmath214 ( or @xmath215 ) .",
    "the physics behind this condition is that the importance of collective effects require scale lengths not much shorter than the debye length , and for the sinus - operator in eq .",
    "( [ wigner-2 ] ) not to reduce to its classical limit we need @xmath216 @xmath217 . if the characteristic spatial scale length @xmath218 is assumed not to be smaller than @xmath219 , and the velocity scale length @xmath220 is of the order of @xmath221 we get the condition @xmath222 ( or @xmath223 @xmath217 for a degenerate plasma ) for quantum effects to be significant @xcite .",
    "this condition applies broadly to many situations , but does not hold for wave - particle interaction in general , as we have @xmath224 in case the resonance lies in the tail of the distribution . in the present paper , focusing on the case of langmuir waves of a single wavelength , we have found that quantum effects become important in the nonlinear regime once @xmath225 in which case the trapped particle energies are quantized .",
    "already when @xmath226 nonlinear oscillations at the bounce frequency is slowed down in accordance with @xmath227 . while these oscillations are qualitatively similar to the well - known bounce oscillations @xcite , it should be noted that in the quantum regime such oscillations can occur even in the absence of trapped particles .",
    "increasing the quantum parameter @xmath118  even further , eventually the nonlinear oscillations are suppressed when @xmath228 in which case usual linear damping takes place .",
    "since the phenomena of study evolves on a time scale slower than the plasma frequency , the above picture can be modified when the collisional influence is accounted for .",
    "let us illustrate this by considering a concrete example .",
    "first we note that the long term evolution will always be affected by collisions .",
    "the characteristic time scale for collitions to be important @xmath229 is given by @xmath230 $ ] .",
    "to some extent we can assure that the phenomena of study occur on a faster scale by picking a relatively large amplitude and avoding a resonance too far out in the tail of the distribution .",
    "however , for a strongly coupled plasma this will not suffice , as @xmath231 approaches the plasma frequency rather than being a small parameter .",
    "thus for our model to apply we must first of all consider a plasma that is weakly coupled . as an example we pick a plasma with a number density @xmath232 @xmath233 and a temperature @xmath234 that correspond to a coupling parameter @xmath235 .",
    "such parameter values may result from laser - plasma experiments , see e.g. ref .",
    "glenzer - redmer .",
    "furthermore the temperature is well above the fermi temperature , and we have a debye length of the order @xmath236 adjusting the wavenumber we can chose the amount of resonant particles that determine the linear landau damping rate and thereby pick he quantum parameter . in order to get @xmath237",
    "we can aim at @xmath238 which is obtained for a wave number @xmath239 .",
    "as @xmath240 we are well in the quantum regime .",
    "we note , however , that although the plasma is weakly coupled , the time - scale for collisional damping is still shorter than the the linear damping time @xmath241 .",
    "this is typically the case in the quantum regime , and hence the long - time evolution is generally much affected by collisions .",
    "however , most of our findings concern the__nonlinear _ _ quantum behavior . as we will demonstrate below these findings are to a large extent still relevant even when collisions are taken into account .",
    "firstly , the quantum modified bounce frequency @xmath119 @xmath242 can be experimentally verified after a few bounce oscillations .",
    "for example , if we pick @xmath243 the bounce oscillations take place on a much faster scale than collisional damping , in which case the quantum modification of the bounce frequency becomes detectable .",
    "moreover , generally the prediction of a nonlinear regime in the absence of trapped particles ( regime v in fig .",
    "7 ) can be verified after a few ( quantum modified ) bounce oscillations .",
    "hence in an experimental situation we do not need to follow the evolution until collisional effects become important .",
    "the situation is somewhat different when it comes to the condition for quantum suppression of the nonlinear oscillations .",
    "it is possible to verify that previously given conditions are incorrect in agreement with our theory , as the presence of bounce oscillations at a faster scale than the linear damping rate will confirm this .",
    "however , the quantitative confirmation of our condition that separates regions iv and v in fig 7 is likely not possible , as that would require us to study the system when the quantum modified bounce frequency is of the same order as the linear landau damping rate . in this case",
    "we need to follow the evolution long enough such that collisions will modify the picture .",
    "thus we conclude that most features of fig 7 remains even when we account for collisional effects , but that there are restrictions arising from the collisional influence that makes the boundary between region iv and v uncertain .",
    "while the study here has focused on landau damping due to electrons , it should be noted that a similar process may take place for photons mendonca-2001,mendonca-2006 .",
    "photon landau damping can be relevant to langmuir waves with relativistic phase velocities , in the presence of electromagnetic radiation , when resonant electrons are nearly absent .",
    "the wave nature of the photons provides the classical counterpart to the quantum electron states , and we can similarly identify a photon bounce frequency @xmath244 .",
    "photon trapping effects were experimentally observed by @xcite .",
    "the staggered leapfrog method also works well when the finite differences in the right hand side is replaced by a velocity derivative , which corresponds to the classical limit . in the quantum regime eqs .",
    "( [ norm-2])-([norm-4 ] ) just constitute a set of ordinary differential equations ( although it is a large set , since the velocity resolution must be sufficient ) , and a fourth order runge - kutta method could also be applied ."
