[",

    "while time - dependent biasing experiments will sample the whole span of the bias coordinate _ de facto _ , umbrella sampling will inherently require a certain number of simulations at different bias centers to attain this broad range .",
    "similarly , unbiased simulations will need to be run for longer in order to reach more distal regions of phase space . generally , it is preferable to run a greater number of nonequilibrium experiments than a single long equilibrium experiment because the outcome of each individual trajectory can be highly dependent on initial conditions .",
    "these sampling problems described on two - dimensional surfaces are likely to be enhanced in systems with higher complexity .",
    "the main caveat with this method , as with all methods based on the nonequilibrium work relation , is that with greater free energy differences , the likelihood of observing a trajectories with negative dissipative work ( work that is less than the free energy difference ) is increasingly unlikely .",
