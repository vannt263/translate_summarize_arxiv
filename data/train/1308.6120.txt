    "a proper quantification of the joint distribution allowing for the time - varying dependence between assets is critical for asset pricing , portfolio allocation and risk reduction . for a number of years",
    ", finance literature has been studying the risk reduction benefit from international diversification .",
    "after the recent 2008 financial crisis , many researchers have documented possible reduction of these benefits due to rising dependence between markets .",
    "the literature concentrating on the central european markets has been limited though , as it is widely believed that after the enlargement of the european union , these markets became integrated with very limited opportunities for diversification .    in this paper , we revisit this line of research , and study the possible benefits from diversification between the czech px and the german dax stock market indices using data covering the five years crisis period . while it is reasonable to believe that the czech and german stock markets show large degree of dependence due to integration of the czech republic into the euro area as well as large dependence of the czech economy on the german one , we aim to study , whether the german and czech stock indices can be considered for the reduction of risk of an international investor .",
    "a number of researchers have addressed the issue of central and eastern european ( cee ) markets integration with the euro area .",
    "@xcite documents increasing stock integration between central european ( ce ) markets and their mature counterparts in europe , and finds lower diversification opportunities at the aggregate stock index level .",
    "@xcite finds long - run cointegrating relationship and hence limited diversification opportunities between cee markets and germany .",
    "@xcite confirm these findings using more recent data .",
    "@xcite analyze the intraday interdependence of western european and central and eastern european markets using wide range of econometric techniques and find evidence of only short - term relationships among the cee and western european stock markets .    in more recent study , @xcite",
    "analyze the comovements of three developed and three emerging markets using dcc - garch model on high frequency data .",
    "they detect small correlation between the developed and emerging markets .",
    "this finding is important for investors , as it allows them to diversify their portfolios by investing in the emerging markets .",
    "however , as the authors stress , this diversification opportunity may not be available more recently due to economic integration with western europe .",
    "a study by @xcite use high frequency data to study the foreign macroeconomic announcements and spillover effects on emerging cee stock markets during 2004 - 2007 . among other findings",
    "it is of interest that frankfurt stock market dominates the spillovers over the three emerging markets , while the reaction to the new york market is smaller .",
    "@xcite study the time - varying conditional correlations among the us , germany , russia , and cee markets .",
    "the authors employ the dcc - garch model for correlations and use weekly data spanning from 1997 - 2009 and they find significant increase of correlation between the us and german markets and the cee markets , especially during 2007 - 2009 financial crisis .    in a recent work , @xcite",
    "analyze the comovements among western europe vis -  - vis central and south eastern europe ( see ) .",
    "the analysis is carried on daily data for the period 2006 - 2011 using bivariate bekk - garch model .",
    "authors find the higher integration among ce and lower integration , with almost zero correlations , among see countries . in another study , @xcite",
    "employ asymmetric dcc - garch to study the comovements in ce markets . using daily data spanning from 2001 - 2011",
    "authors find increase in correlations after these countries joined the european union , whereas asymmetric correlation effects were found only for hungary ( bux ) and poland ( wig ) pair .",
    "in addition , positive relation among conditional correlations and conditional variances suggesting lower diversifications in turbulent times is confirmed .",
    "a common feature of these studies is that they use cointegration , or multivariate garch to study the dependence , and with some exceptions , they use the data before the 2008 financial crisis .",
    "we contribute to the literature by using a very different approach proposed recently by @xcite , allowing us to model the time - varying joint distribution of stock market returns .",
    "using recently proposed time - varying copula methodology and utilizing high frequency data , we build an empirical model which allows us to study the time - varying benefits from diversification .",
    "in addition , we contribute to the understanding of the relationship using recent data covering crisis years . using the fresh data , and state of the art methodologies ,",
    "we revisit the literature and uncover significant time - varying nature of the benefits from diversification between the px and dax markets .",
    "this finding is particularly interesting as previous literature generally reports decreasing potential for diversification .",
    "the work is organized as follows .",
    "the second section introduces our empirical model composing from the realized garch and generalised autoregressive score time - varying copulas .",
    "the third section introduces the data we use , while fourth section discusses the in - sample and out - of - sample fits of all model specifications , and chooses the one which best describes the data . finally , the fifth section tests the economic implications of our empirical model .",
    "we first evaluate the quantile forecasts , which are central to risk management , and then study the time - varying diversification benefits implied by our model .",
    "the last section concludes .",
    "we introduce the empirical model used for describing the dependence between the german dax and czech px stock indices .",
    "our modeling strategy utilizes high frequency data to capture the dependence in the margins and recently proposed dynamic copulas to model the dynamic dependence .",
    "final model is thus able to describe the conditional time - varying joint distribution of returns .",
    "the methodology is based on the @xcite s ( 1959 ) theorem extended to conditional distributions by @xcite .",
    "the extended @xcite s theorem allows to decompose a conditional joint distribution into marginal distributions and a time - varying copula .",
    "consider the bivariate stochastic process @xmath0 with @xmath1 , which has a conditional joint distribution @xmath2 and conditional marginal distributions @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "then @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the time - varying conditional copula of @xmath7 containing all information about the dependence between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and @xmath10 available information set , usually @xmath11 .",
    "due to @xcite s theorem , we are able to construct a dynamic joint distribution @xmath2 by linking together any two marginal distributions @xmath3 and @xmath4 with any copula function .",
    "theoretically , there is limitless number of valid joint distribution functions that can be created by combining different copulas with different margins , making this approach very flexible .",
    "the first step in building an empirical model based on copulas is to model the margins .",
    "since the largest part of the dependence in financial time series is in their variance , majority of researchers use the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity ( garch ) approach of @xcite in this step .",
    "we use the latest advances in the literature which improve volatility modelling by adding the realized volatility measure to the garch model .",
    "this approach utilizes high frequency data to help in explaining the latent volatility .",
    "compared with standard garch(1,1 ) model where the conditional variance of @xmath12-th asset , @xmath13 is dependent on its past values @xmath14 and past values of @xmath15 , @xcite propose to utilize realized volatility measure and make @xmath16 dependent on the realized variance as well . in this work ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the simple log - linear specification of the so - called realized garch(1,1 ) .",
    "for the general framework of realized garch(@xmath17,@xmath18 ) models we suggest to consult @xcite . while it is important to model conditional time - varying mean @xmath19 , we also include the standard autoregressive ( ar ) term into the final modeling strategy .",
    "as we will find later , autoregressive term of order no larger than two is appropriate for the dax and px return series , thus we restrict ourselves to specifying ar(2 ) with log - linear realgarch(1,1 ) model as in @xcite @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the constant mean , @xmath16 conditional variance , which is latent , @xmath22 realized volatility measured from high frequency data , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 leverage function .",
    "for the @xmath22 , we use the high frequency data and compute it as a sum of squared intraday returns @xcite .",
    "innovations @xmath25 are modelled by the flexible skewed-_t _ distribution of @xcite .",
    "this distribution has two shape parameters , a skewness parameter @xmath26 controlling the degree of asymmetry , and a degree of freedom parameter @xmath27 $ ] controlling the thickness of tails .",
    "when @xmath28 , the distribution reduces to the standard student s @xmath29 distribution , and when @xmath30 , it becomes skewed normal distribution , while for @xmath30 and @xmath28 , it becomes @xmath31 .",
    "thus after the time varying dependence in mean and volatility is modeled , we are left with innovations @xmath32 which have a constant conditional distribution with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "then the conditional copula of @xmath33 is equal to the conditional distribution of @xmath34 : . ]",
    "@xmath35 with @xmath36 being copula parameters , and @xmath37'$ ] conditional probability integral transform @xmath38      the notion of time - varying copula models was initially introduced by @xcite . in further literature , @xcite develop a model where the multivariate garch is extended by copula functions to capture the remaining dependence .",
    "recently , @xcite propose a stochastic copula models , which allow parameters to evolve as a latent time series .",
    "another possibility is offered by arch - type models for volatility @xcite and related models for copulas @xcite , which allow the parameters to be some function of lagged observables .",
    "an advantage of the second approach is that it avoids the need to  integrate out \" the innovation terms driving the latent time series processes .    when working with time - varying copula models the driving dynamics of the model is of crucial importance . for our empirical model",
    ", we therefore adopt the generalized autoregressive score ( gas ) model of @xcite , which specifies the time - varying copula parameter ( @xmath39 ) as a function of the lagged copula parameter and a forcing variable that is related to the standardized score of the copula log - likelihood .",
    "this type of dynamics reduces the one - step - ahead prediction error at current observation given the current parameter values of the copula function .",
    "consider a copula with time - varying parameters : @xmath40    often , a copula parameter is required to fall within a specific range e.g. correlation for normal or student s @xmath29 copula is required to fall in between values of -1 and 1 . to ensure this , @xcite suggest to transform copula parameter by an increasing invertible function @xmath41 ( e.g. , logarithmic , logistic , etc . ) to the parameter @xmath42 for a copula with transformed time - varying parameter @xmath43 ,",
    "a gas(1,1 ) model is specified as @xmath44=i(\\delta_t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while this specification for the time - varying parameters is arbitrary , @xcite motivate it in a way that the model nests a variety of popular approaches from conditional variance models to trade durations and counts models . also , the recursion is similar to numerical optimisation algorithms such as the gauss - newton algorithm .",
    "having specified the model , the last step is to choose the copula function used in the application .",
    "the time - varying copulas we use in this work are the rotated gumbel , normal and student s @xmath29 .",
    "in addition we use constant copulas for comparison . to save the space ,",
    "we do not provide functional forms of copula functions used in this work .",
    "these can be found in @xcite .",
    "the final dynamic copula realized garch model defines a dynamic parametric model for the joint distribution .",
    "the joint likelihood is defined as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is vector of all parameters to be estimated , including parameters of the marginal distributions @xmath47 and parameters of the copula , @xmath36 .",
    "the parameters are estimated using a two - step estimation procedure , generally known as multi - stage maximum likelihood ( msml ) estimation , first estimating the marginal distributions and then estimating the copula model conditioning on the estimated marginal distribution parameters .",
    "while this greatly simplifies the estimation , inference on the resulting copula parameter estimates is more difficult than usual as the estimation error from the marginal distribution must be taken into account . in result , msmle is asymptotically less efficient than one - stage mle , however as discussed by @xcite , this loss is not great in many cases .",
    "moreover , bootstrap methodology can be used for statistical inference .",
    "one of the appealing alternatives to a fully parametric model is to estimate univariate distribution non parametrically , for example by using the empirical distribution function .",
    "combination of a nonparametric model for marginal distribution and parametric model for the copula results in a semiparametric copula model , which we use for comparison to its fully parametric counterpart .",
    "forecasts based on a semiparametric estimation where nonparametric marginal distribution is combined with parametric copula function are not common in economic literature thus it is interesting to compare it in our modelling strategy .",
    "for the margins of the semi - parametric models , we use the non - parametric empirical distribution @xmath48 introduced by @xcite , which consists of modelling the marginal distributions by the ( rescaled ) empirical distribution .",
    "@xmath49 in this case , the parameter estimation is conducted via maximizing likelihood @xmath50 as it can be seen , the likelihood reduces in estimating the copula parameters only .",
    "however , we should note that the inference on parameters is more difficult than usual , hence we rely on bootstrap inference as advocated in @xcite .",
    "an important issue when working with copulas is the selection of the best copula from the pool .",
    "several methods and tests have been proposed for selection procedure .",
    "the methods proposed by @xcite are based on distance from empirical copula . @xcite",
    "propose the use of pseudo - likelihood ratio test for selecting semiparametric multivariate copula models .. ] a test on conditional predictive ability ( cpa ) is proposed by @xcite .",
    "this is a robust test which allows to accommodate both , unconditional and conditional objectives .",
    "recently , @xcite have proposed a test for comparing predictive ability of competing copulas .",
    "the test is based on kullback - leibler information criterion ( klic ) and its statistics is a special case of the unconditional version of @xcite .",
    "as our main aim is to use the model for forecasting , out - of - sample performance of models will be tested by cpa , which considers the forecast performance of two competing models conditional on their estimated parameters to be equal under the null hypothesis @xmath51 = 0 \\\\ h_{a1 } & : e [ \\hat{\\mathbf{l } } ] > 0 \\mbox { and } h_{a2 } : e [ \\hat{\\mathbf{l } } ] < 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 .",
    "other advantages of this test are the possibilities to use it for both nested and non - nested models , and also for comparison of parametric and semiparametric models .",
    "the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic is @xmath31 and we compute the asymptotic variance using hac estimates to correct for possible serial correlation and heteroskedasticity in the differences in log - likelihoods .",
    "the data set consists of the 5-minute prices of the prague px and german dax cash indices over the period january 3 , 2008 until may 31 , 2013 , covering the recent recession .",
    "we synchronise the data using the time stamp matching , and eliminate transactions executed on saturdays , sundays , holidays , december 24 to 26 , and december 31 to january 2 due to low activity on these days , which could lead to estimation bias . hence ,",
    "in our analysis we work with data from 1349 days .         for the empirical model , we need two time series , namely daily returns and realized variance to be able to estimate the realized garch model in margins . for this ,",
    "obtain daily returns as a sum of logarithmic intraday returns , hence we work with open - close returns .",
    "realized variance is computed as a sum of squared 5-minute intraday returns .",
    "figure [ fig : prices ] plots the development of prices of the px and dax together with its realized volatility .",
    "note that plot of prices is normalized so we can compare the movements , and for the plot of realized volatility , we use daily volatility annualized according to the convention @xmath53 .",
    "strong time - varying nature of the volatility can be noticed immediately for both px as well as dax indices . realized volatility of",
    "the dax is larger in average when compared to the volatility of the px index .",
    "otherwise the volatility has similar distributional properties for both indices .",
    ".parameter estimates from ar(@xmath54 ) _ log - linear _ realized garch(1,1 ) and benchmark garch(1,1 ) with innovations distributed _ skew - t _ and normal respectively .",
    "_ t_-statistics reported in parentheses . [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , < , > , > , > , > \" , ]     before modeling the dependence structure between the px and dax , we need to model their conditional marginal distributions first . considering general ar models up to five lags",
    ", we find ar(2 ) to best capture the time - varying dependence in mean of px , while dax has a constant mean .",
    "these results are in line with previous research @xcite .",
    "table [ tab : condvarmodel ] summarizes the realized - garch(1,1 ) fit for both px and dax .",
    "in addition , benchmark garch(1,1 ) model is fit to the data for comparison .",
    "all the estimated parameters are significantly different from zero . by observing partial log - likelihood @xmath55 as well as information criteria",
    ", we can see that including realized measures into the garch model improves the fits significantly .",
    "this is crucial for copulas , as we need to specify the best possible model in the margins to make sure there is no univariate dependence left .",
    "if a misspecified model is used for the marginal distributions , then the probability integral transforms will not be uniformly distributed and this will result in copula misspecification . for the estimated standardized residuals from the ar(2 )",
    "realized garch(1,1 ) , we consider both parametric and nonparametric distributions as motivated earlier in the text .      before specifying a functional form for time - varying copula function , we test for the presence of time - varying dependence using the simple approach based on the arch lm test .",
    "the test statistics is computed from the ols estimate of the covariance matrix and critical values are obtained using _ i.i.d . _ bootstrap ( for detailed information , consult @xcite ) .",
    "computing the test for the time - varying dependence between the dax and px up to @xmath56 lags , we find the joint significance of all coefficients .",
    "thus we can conclude that there is evidence against constant correlation for the dax and px .",

    "we can see that all the time - varying models are well specified and the conditional quantile forecasts from them are not rejected by the dq test . for the statistical testing , we use time - varying normal copula as a benchmark forecaster and test all the other models against it .",
    "when looking at the loss functions @xmath89 , we can see that all the quantiles implied by the different models can not be distinguished from each other statistically , except the 1% quantile .",
    "this is mainly because student s @xmath29 copula has large number of degrees of freedom basically converged to the normal one .",
    "thus overall , ar(2)-realized garch(1,1 ) with time - varying copula models are able to describe and forecast the quantiles of the px - dax distribution very well .      in case",
    "the dependence of the assets is changing over time strongly , it needs to translate to changing diversification benefits as well .",
    "unlike var , expected shortfall satisfies the sub - additivity property and is a coherent measure of risk .",
    "motivated by these properties , @xcite propose a measure capturing the dynamics in diversification benefits based on expected shortfall .",
    "the conditional diversification benefit ( cdb ) for a given probability level @xmath71 is defined by     using time - varying normal copula together with bootstraped confidence band for the constant conditional diversification benefits.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is expected shortfall of the portfolio at hand , @xmath92 , \\text{for } \\alpha \\in ( 0,1),\\ ] ] @xmath93 is upper bound of the portfolio expected shortfall being the weighted average of the asset s individual expected shortfalls , and @xmath94 lower bound on the expected shortfall being the inverse cumulative distribution function for the portfolio . in other words , this lower bound corresponds to the case where the portfolio never loses more than its @xmath71 distribution quantile .",
    "the measure is designed to stay within @xmath95 $ ] interval , and is increasing in the level of diversification benefits . when the cdb is equal to zero , there are literarily no benefits from diversification , when it equals one , the benefits from diversification are highest possible .",
    "figure [ fig : cdb ] plots the conditional diversification benefits for the px and dax portfolio implied by our empirical model for @xmath96 . similarly to the var case ,",
    "as there is no closed form solution to our empirical model available , we rely on the simulations for cdb computation . encouraged by the previous results , we compute the cdb for the ar(2 ) realized garch with time - varying normal copula model .",
    "analysis could be taken step ahead by optimizing portfolio weights for the highest diversification benefits .",
    "this is done in @xcite , who basically find very small increase , implying that equally weighted portfolio is usually very close to optimal if cdb is used .",
    "also please note that here we do not exploit the full potential of dynamic asset allocation .",
    "diversification benefits vary over time greatly . from the beginning of the sample ,",
    "the benefits from diversification between the dax and the px index are rising gradually until the end of the year 2009 , when they start to decline .",
    "the lowest values are at the beginning of the year 2012 , while from this point until the 2013 , the benefits stay more or less lower .",
    "to support our results , we also report 90% bootstrapped confidence bands computed around a constant level of diversification benefits . assuming the returns data are independently distributed over time with the same unconditional correlation as the px and dax pair , bootstrap confidence level can be conveniently computed via simulations .",
    "we use 10.000 simulations , and report the mean value together with distribution of constant conditional benefits in figure [ fig : cdb ] .",
    "we can see , that the time - varying nature of the conditional diversification benefits is statistically significant , as it departs from the simulated constant distribution .",
    "thus contrary to the general expectation of no diversification benefits for investors considering the czech px index as a diversification tool for the german dax due to very high correlation between these two stocks , we find actual benefits which are varying strongly in time .",
    "this work revisits the czech px and german dax stock markets dependence with the aim to study the opportunities of these two assets in portfolio management . using an empirical model utilizing high frequency data in the time varying copulas , we study the joint conditional distribution of the px and dax returns .",
    "the final ar(2 ) realized garch(1,1 ) with time - varying normal copula is able to capture the dynamics accurately , yielding precise quantile forecasts . using the crisis data , we study the time - varying correlations between the px and dax returns . more important , we study how the time - varying dependence translates to the conditional diversification benefits .",
    "the main result is that the possible diversification benefits are strongly varying over time , and hence even after the 2008 financial crisis , it may be economically interesting to use the dax and px returns for the risk diversification .",
    "this is important finding , as it is contrary to the belief that crisis caused reduction in international diversification benefits .",
    "czech and german economies are strongly tightened as well , so one would expect that especially after the inclusion of the czech republic into the euro area , diversification benefits will disappear ."
