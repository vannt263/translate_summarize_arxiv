    "we can understand this from the energy conservation given in equation ( [ eq : gs ] ) .",
    "the time dependence of the shock lorentz factor is related to the ambient plasma density .",
    "when @xmath315 and the ambient plasma density is represented by the power law on @xmath29 ( @xmath193 ) , the shock lorentz factor is expressed as @xmath316 .",
    "numerical results agree with this relation .",
    "especially when @xmath317 , the shock lorentz factor linearly increases with radius .",
    "finally let us apply our results to the magnetar flares . in the discussion",
    "below , we concentrate on the extraordinarily energetic outbursts ( giant flares ) observed in sgrs . although axps as well as sgrs would be magnetars , the giant flares have not been detected from the axps .",
    "the reason would be that the giant flares are very rare events ( 1 per a few decades in the whole sky ) .",
    "the shock lorentz factor @xmath5 is estimated from the mass ejected by the flare @xmath318 , and equation ( [ sol : none ] ) as @xmath319 the expansion speed of the magnetic loop is relativistic when @xmath320 ( see , also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the mass density behind the forward shock is estimated from equations ( [ eq : rhr ] ) , ( [ eq : rhg ] ) and ( [ eq : gsn ] ) as @xmath321 the mass density in the ambient plasma @xmath322 estimated from equations ( [ eq : rhr ] ) , ( [ eq : rhg ] ) , ( [ eq : gsn ] ) and ( [ eq : rosn ] ) , is much larger than the goldreich - julian density .",
    "such dense coronal pair plasmas would be created by the pair production when the magnetically trapped fireball is formed on the surface of the magnetar @xcite .    the temperature of the shocked gas is evaluated by using equation ( [ eq : rhp ] ) as @xmath323 here we assume the pair plasma .",
    "although the radiation spectrum of the initial spike in the giant flare is not well determined because of its short duration , the typical temperature indicated by the spectrum is a few @xmath324 @xcite , which is lower than @xmath325 estimated from our analytical solutions .",
    "we have to note that the temperature at the photosphere @xmath326 should be smaller than @xmath325 because the temperature decreases with decreasing the radius behind the shock ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig : hydro - r ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : rogm ] ) . the radius of the photosphere @xmath327 can be determined by the condition that the optical depth of the expanding magnetic loops @xmath328 satisfies @xmath329 where @xmath236 is the angle between the velocity vector and the direction of the photon propagation @xcite , and @xmath330 is the effective opacity . here",
    "@xmath331 and @xmath332 are the opacity for the electron scattering and the free - free absorption , respectively .",
    "we assume that the ambient plasma ( @xmath333 ) is optically thin .",
    "the electron scattering is the dominant source for the opacity inside the shocks .",
    "this is because the plasma temperature is increased by the shock heating , so that the free - free opacity ( @xmath334 ) is much smaller than that of the electron scattering .",
    "we numerically integrate equation ( [ eq : tau ] ) assuming that @xmath335 , the expansion energy @xmath336 , and the mass of the central star @xmath337 , where @xmath338 is the solar mass .",
    "the temperature at the photosphere @xmath326 calculated at @xmath339 from the analytical solutions ( equations [ eq : zt ] [ eq : p ] , [ eq : rho ] , [ sol : ps ] and [ sol : ds ] ) can roughly be fitted by @xmath340 when @xmath341 and @xmath342 .",
    "the result is almost independent of the radius of the contact discontinuity ( i.e. , @xmath343 ) .",
    "the temperature in the observer s frame is @xmath344 when @xmath345 .",
    "here we assume @xmath346 since the photosphere is very close to the shock surface .",
    "this result is consistent with the observational results when @xmath345 and @xmath347 .",
    "such hot , relativistically expanding magnetic loops are expected to be formed with the help of the magnetic reconnections . according to the scenario by @xcite , the magnetic reconnections inside the magnetic loops are responsible for the initial spike of the flares ( see , also * ? ? ?",
    "subsequently , the plasma is heated up by the shocks produced by the magnetic reconnection . by applying our models to the giant flares ,",
    "the time evolution of the luminosity from expanding plasma is expressed as @xmath348 from @xmath349 and equation ( [ eq : tpsn ] ) .",
    "here we assumed @xmath350 . since @xmath351 from equations ( [ eq : gs ] ) and ( [ eq : ropower ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath352 because @xmath353 from equation ( [ sol : apprs ] ) .",
    "@xcite reported that the observed photon counts decreased exponentially with time after the initial spike .",
    "however , the photon counts at the earlier stage , whose decay time is very short ( @xmath354 ) , is not inconsistent with the power - law decay .",
    "in addition to the initial spikes , a hump is observed a few hundred seconds after the initial spike @xcite .",
    "it is considered that the energy is re - injected from the central star .",
    "we now consider another possibility for this hump . before the magnetic energy release",
    ", the toroidal magnetic energy can be comparable to that of the poloidal magnetic fields inside the magnetic loops .",
    "when the magnetic reconnection takes place inside the magnetic loops , the magnetic energy of the poloidal magnetic fields is converted to the plasma energies , generating the twisted flux ropes .",
    "the toroidal magnetic field energy of the flux ropes does not dissipate in this process .",
    "when the twisted flux ropes cross the alfvn radius ( @xmath311 light cylinder ) , the rest magnetic energy will be dissipated by interaction with the ambient global magnetic fields . the time scale that a flux rope crosses the light cylinder and releases the magnetic energy is about @xmath355 , which is consistent with the observations .",
    "the energy dissipation at the light cylinder can be responsible for the humps .",
    "we need further study to verify these processes .",
    "we are grateful to an anonymous referee for improving our manuscript .",
