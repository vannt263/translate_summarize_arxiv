    "secular evolution of structure in disk galaxies is largely governed by internal gravitational processes . in this context",
    ", density waves play an important role as a driver for the internal evolution .",
    "self - gravitating bars contain a significant fraction of the disk material and thus have a prominent role in the evolution of their host disks .",
    "bars are efficient drivers for redistribution of angular momentum within their host galaxies , leading to mass transfer from the outer parts towards the circumnuclear regions ( e.g. , shlosman , frank , & begelman 1989 ) , ultimately via structures such as nuclear bars or spirals , continuing to the vicinity of their host galaxy s nuclear supermassive black hole ( e.g. , fathi et al .",
    "an increasing number of observational as well as theoretical results suggest that secular evolution of disks due to density waves does occur , but the details on how the structures and the internal dynamics are affected require more inputs , in particular to constrain the mass models in the inner parts of galaxies where the rotation curve is still rising .",
    "-2    a key parameter in self - consistent models of barred galaxies is the angular rate at which the bar pattern rotates , i.e. , the pattern speed of the bar , denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "this parameter is needed to determine whether a bar is spontaneous or tidal , to derive the velocity fields as well as mass transfer rates , and hence the densities , in perturbed disks , or to establish whether spiral arms and any secondary bars are driven by resonance interactions with primary bars ( e.g. , shlosman & heller 2002 ; block et al .",
    "however it has proved complex to determine this parameter observationally .",
    "-2    the most common technique is based on assumed knowledge of the locations of the resonances ( buta & combes 1996 ) which in turn involves understanding the behavior of stars and gas at these resonances .",
    "thus , purely observationally , @xmath6  can be estimated by the locations of the resonances using surface brightness profiles of galaxies ( e.g. , puerari & dottori 1997 ) .",
    "alternatively , @xmath6  can be estimated by matching observations to models as suggested by athanassoula ( 1992 ) and successfully applied by salo et al .",
    "a valuable technique for the determination of @xmath6  was introduced by tremaine & weinberg ( 1984 , hereafter referred to as the tw method ) , which allows the measurement of this parameter from kinematic measurements without adopting any specific dynamical model .",
    "its application requires only measurements of the distribution of intensity and velocity of a component that reacts to the density wave .",
    "it relies on the validity of the continuity equation and assumes that the component rotates in a unique and well defined pattern .",
    "thus the method has been mostly applied to stellar kinematic measurements ( e.g. , merrifield & kuijken 1995 ; corsini , debattista & aguerri 2003 ; maciejewski 2006 ) .",
    "the tw method is , however , in principle applicable for any tracer of a component s surface density inferred from the intensity of the tracer ( zimmer , rand , & mcgraw 2004 ) .",
    "the main uncertainty of the tw method results is due to the presence of dust , although as shown by gerssen & debattista ( 2007 ) , these uncertainties do not significantly influence the derived pattern speed values .",
    "the applicability of the tw method to h@xmath0  emission was shown convincingly by hernandez et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for m  100 and emsellem et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for ngc  1068 which also showed some evidence of mode coupling between different resonances .",
    "-2    here , we apply the tw method to fabry - perot  observations of the h@xmath0-emitting gas in the nearby late - type spiral galaxy ngc  6946 , with an inclination of @xmath7 ( carignan et al . 1990 ; zimmer et al . 2004 ; boomsma 2007 ) and at a distance of 5.5 mpc ( kennicutt et al . 2003 ) .",
    "ngc  6946 is a grand - design barred spiral galaxy which shows three main gravitational distortions : a large oval with radius @xmath8 , a primary bar with ellipticity 0.15 and radius @xmath9 , a nuclear bar with ellipticity 0.4 and radius @xmath10 , which is almost perpendicular to the primary bar ( elmegreen , elmegreen , & montenegro 1992 ; regan & vogel 1995 ; elmegreen , chromey , & santos 1998 ; schinnerer et al .",
    "the disturbed spiral - arm morphology has led to the conclusion that an @xmath11 distortion is superimposed on the primary @xmath1 mode , both with the same corotation radius , @xmath8   ( elmegreen et al . 1992 ; crosthwaite 2001 ) .",
    "these structural properties make ngc  6946 an ideal laboratory for a detailed study of the @xmath6 , to investigate whether the large - scale oval is capable of driving the formation and evolution of the inner components by resonance interaction .",
    "we present the data in section  [ sec : reduction ] , followed by the analysis outline and the presentation of the results in section  [ sec : analysis ] , and finally the discussion in section  [ sec : discussion].-2    velocity field for ngc  6946 .",
    "the thick diagonal line shows the kinematic major - axis , and the dashed ellipses show the location of the corotation radius ( outermost ) , the oilr ( middle ) , and the iilr radius of the oval ( see section  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the arcs inside which the rotation curve of fig .  [ fig : rotcurve ] has been averaged , and the parallel dotted lines show the position of blocks of 10 apertures along which velocity measurements have been extracted .",

    "intensity map used in conjunction with the velocity field presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : velfield ] to calculate the @xmath6 . ]",
    "ngc  6946 was observed with the fantomm  fabry - perot  interferometer @xcite mounted on the 1.6 meter telescope at the observatoire du mont mgantic .",
    "the interference filter , centered at @xmath14  , was used to scan the h@xmath0  emission - line in 40 channels of 0.21   during a total of 120 minutes .",
    "the fabry - perot   was tuned to a free spectral range of 391.9 , over the @xmath15 effective field of view with 16/pix .",
    "complete observation logs can be found in @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the data cubes was performed using the adhocw  package @xcite with consistency checks by applying the idl - based reduction package developed by @xcite .",
    "further details on the reduction procedure can be found in @xcite . after reduction and final cleaning ,",
    "29191 independent velocity measurements remain ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : velfield]).-2     ( curves ) , and the hi rotation curve taken from @xcite marked as crosses . ]",
    "in cartesian coordinates , where the @xmath16 and @xmath17 axes are aligned parallel to the apparent major and minor axes of the galactic disk at inclination , @xmath18 , the tw method yields the pattern speed @xmath19 \\ ; dx}{\\displaystyle \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } i(x ) \\ , [ x - x_0 ] \\ ; dx},\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the position along the major - axis , @xmath20 is the observed intensity , @xmath21  is the observed line - of - sight velocity and @xmath13 , the systemic velocity .",
    "the nucleus of the galaxy is located at @xmath22 , and the integrals are performed along any cut parallel to the apparent major - axis . as originally noted by @xcite , the use of an erroneous dynamical center could introduce errors in the derivation of the @xmath6 , although this could be avoided by using an appropriate weight function to eliminate or reduce the anomalies .",
    "@xcite refined this technique by normalizing the measured quantities with the total intensity in the same aperture , and obtained @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the intensity - weighted @xmath21-@xmath13  and @xmath25 the intensity - weighted position of the tracer along the aperture in question .",
    "thus the calculated @xmath6  for each aperture does not change , but what changes in equation ( [ eq : twrefined ] ) , is the position of each aperture in the plot of @xmath26 versus @xmath27 . as a result , the statistical importance of each aperture is evened out , and singularities in positions where @xmath27 tends to zero , i.e. , near the center of the galaxy , are avoided .",
    "-2    to derive @xmath6 , the tw method relies on accurate derivation of the geometry of the galactic disk where the bar resides .",
    "we derive the position of the center , kinematic major - axis , and @xmath13  by applying the tilted - ring method on the observed h@xmath0  velocity field using tukey s bi - weight mean formalism @xcite , which is known to be non - sensitive to outliers . applying this formalism",
    "has proved to be advantageous for cases where outliers , created by bad pixels or strong non - circular motions , can bias the derived parameters , and thus assigning smaller weights to these pixels delivers trustable disk geometry as well as kinematic parameters @xcite .",
    "we derive @xmath13= @xmath28 , and the major - axis at @xmath29 , both in good agreement with the comprehensive neutral hydrogen analysis by @xcite and @xcite.-2     by plotting the averaged intensity weighted velocities , @xmath24 , versus the averaged intensity weighted positions , @xmath25 , for each three - pixels wide aperture , i.e. , @xmath30th of the space between the parallel dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : velfield ] .",
    "open symbols show data points from apertures outside the oilr of the large oval , and filled symbols show the data points inside this radius . ]    for the derived disk geometry and @xmath13 , the corresponding rotation curve is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rotcurve ] , where cuts along the redshifted and blueshifted sections of the disk as well as average rotation curve within the bounded section shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : velfield ] , are overplotted .",
    "figure  [ fig : rotcurve ] demonstrates that the derived disk geometry results in a symmetric cut in the velocity field . assuming a symmetric barred structure and a homogeneous dust distribution",
    ", a correct dynamical center should imply that the rotation curve extracted along the major axis is identical to that derived from the tilted - ring method .",
    "moreover , the non - circular velocities at the blueshifted and red - shifted parts of the disk , should fall and rise with respect to the rotation curve in a symmetric fashion .",
    "this is exactly what we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : rotcurve ] .",
    "furthermore , we note that our rotation curve is in agreement with that derived from hi studies by @xcite and @xcite , with the advantage that our data allows us to resolve the inner regions .",
    "-2    rotation curve ( inner 9 kpc ) and hi rotation curve ( outer kpc ) presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : rotcurve ] . applying the epicyclic approximation",
    ", we also plot the epicyclic frequency curves , @xmath31 for @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "the pattern speed of the oval , with errors , is marked as the horizontal line , and the location of each resonance radius is marked with a dot .",
    "the two innermost dots mark the iilr and oilr radii discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] . ]",
    "this observational result confirms a `` bars within bars within bars '' scenario , where an evolved large primary @xmath1 perturbation forms an inner bar whose pattern speed could be larger by a factor of up to three ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the bar may be found at any position angle with respect to the large scale oval , and such systems are known to form nuclear bars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that multiple bars probably generally have different pattern speeds . in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega ] , we see that @xmath4  is consistent with the nuclear bar being located at the ilr of the primary bar in ngc  6946 .",
    "furthermore , as found by @xcite , the nuclear bar is almost perpendicular to the larger bar , which they interpret as the presence of the well known @xmath34 and @xmath35 orbits of the same structure . placing the corotation of the larger bar at the oilr of the oval agrees with the nuclear bar being inside the ilr of the primary bar , i.e. , the iilr of the oval structure .",
    "such a scenario is also known to drive efficient mass flow from the outer parts toward the nuclear regions in galaxies ( shlosman , frank , & begelman 1989 ) where a starburst can occur ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "-2    the tight agreement between the sizes of the different components with the predicted location of the resonances confirm that the inner components have formed by means of resonance interaction of the main @xmath1 gravitational perturbation , i.e. , the large oval and two prominent spiral arms .",
    "as discussed for example by maciejewski ( 2004 ) , linear theory is applicable only if the gravitational perturbation is not strong . in ngc  6946",
    ", this is confirmed since the main perturbation is an oval distorsion and not a strong bar .",
    "the inflow is confirmed by our residual velocity field after subtracting the rotational model from the observed velocity field .",
    "a detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this letter , however , the velocity field presented in fig .  [ fig : velfield ] shows the expected signature of the oilr as a `` kink '' in the contour tracing the systemic velocity .",
