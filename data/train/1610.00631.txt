    "the standard model ( sm ) has been so successful that it explains almost all the existing experimental data with a very high accuracy .",
    "the lack of clear evidence for new particles at the lhc experiment so far began to cast doubt on the naturalness argument which has been the driving force of search for new physics at tev scale . on the other hand , there are many phenomena that require physics beyond the sm , such as dark matter , baryon asymmetry , inflation , neutrino masses and mixings , etc . among them , the gauge coupling unification in a grand unified theory ( gut ) is an intriguing and plausible possibility , which has been extensively studied in the literature .",
    "the running of gauge couplings are obtained by solving the renormalization group ( rg ) equations , which depend on the matter contents and interactions among them .",
    "assuming only the sm particles , the sm gauge coupling constants come close to each other as the renormalization scale increases . if we take a close look at the running , however , they actually fail to unify unless rather large threshold corrections are introduced .",
    "the gauge coupling unification is realized with a greater accuracy in various extensions of the sm , such as supersymmetry @xcite , introduction of incomplete multiplets ( see e.g. refs.@xcite ) , etc .",
    "one simple resolution is to introduce unbroken hidden u(1)@xmath1 gauge symmetry with a large kinetic mixing @xmath2 with u(1)@xmath3  @xcite ; the kinetic mixing with unbroken hidden u(1)@xmath1 modifies the normalization of the hypercharge gauge coupling in the high energy , thereby improving the gauge coupling unification . in this paper",
    "we focus on this simple resolution and argue that gut with a hidden photon naturally leads to minicharged dark matter . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the two of the present authors ( f.t . and",
    ". ) , together with m.  yamada , recently studied the gauge coupling unification with unbroken hidden u(1)@xmath1 by solving the rg equations at one - loop level , including the effect of extra matter fields charged under u(1)@xmath1 , and discussed a possible origin of the required large kinetic mixing as well as phenomenological and cosmological implications of the extra matter fields .",
    "those hidden matters are stable and contribute to dark matter .",
    "in particular , they acquire fractional electric charge through the large kinetic mixing , and such fractionally charged stable matter has been searched for by many experiments @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the gut with a hidden photon in a greater detail and argue that minicharged dark matter is its natural outcome .",
    "first of all we refine the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite by solving the rg equations at two - loop level , and determine the gut unification scale as well as the required size of the kinetic mixing precisely .",
    "the gut unification scale turns out to be about @xmath0gev which is high enough to suppress the proton decay rate , and the required kinetic mixing is @xmath4 at the scale of the @xmath5-boson mass .",
    "secondly , we find that the unification is almost determined by the kinetic mixing , but it is rather insensitive to the size of the hidden gauge coupling or the presence of vector - like matter fields charged under u(1)@xmath1 and/or su(5 ) . as a consequence of the kinetic mixing ,",
    "the hidden matter fields carry a non - zero electric charge , and they become minicharged dark matter if the hidden gauge coupling is sufficiently small .",
    "thus the minicharged dark matter is a natural outcome of the gut with a hidden photon",
    ". we will give concrete examples of such minicharged dark matter .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we explain how the gauge coupling unification is improved by adding u(1)@xmath1 , and show the results of solving rg equations at two - loop level . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we discuss implications of the hidden matter fields for minicharged dark matter .",
    "the last section is devoted for discussion and conclusions .",
    "one way to improve unification of the sm gauge couplings is to modify the normalization of the u(1)@xmath3 gauge coupling at high energy scales .",
    "this can be realized by introducing unbroken hidden gauge symmetry u(1)@xmath1 , which has a large kinetic mixing with u(1)@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the relevant kinetic terms of the hypercharge and hidden gauge fields , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , are given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are gauge field strengths of u(1)@xmath3 and u(1)@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "in this basis which we call the original basis in the following , the gauge fields and field strengths are indicated with a prime symbol . for later use",
    ", we also introduce pairs of vector - like fermions , @xmath11 where @xmath12 has a hypercharge of @xmath13 and a u(1)@xmath1 charge of @xmath14 .",
    "the gauge interaction terms of the matter field @xmath12 are written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the gauge couplings in the original basis .",
    "we assume that hypercharges of vector - like fermions are rational numbers in the original basis such that they can be embedded into the su(5 ) gut multiplet",
    ".    the canonically normalized gauge fields , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , are obtained by the following transformations : @xmath20 and then , the kinetic terms become canonical , @xmath21 . in this canonical basis ,",
    "gauge interaction terms of the matter field are written as @xmath22 \\psi_i,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the gauge couplings of u(1)@xmath3 , and @xmath17 remains unchanged by the transformation from the original basis to the canonical one .",
    "one can see that the field @xmath12 now acquires a fractional hypercharge , @xmath25 , which is a renormalization scale dependent quantity  @xcite .",
    "the u(1)@xmath3 coupling with a prime , @xmath16 , is the gauge coupling in the original basis ( see eq.([eq : org ] ) ) , and is smaller by @xmath26 compared to @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the kinetic mixing with unbroken u(1)@xmath1 modifies the normalization of the hypercharge coupling constant , and the unification of the gauge couplings can be improved by choosing @xmath2 so that @xmath27 at the gut scale is equal to the unified gauge coupling determined by the running of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "compared to @xmath24 . on the other hand , introducing extra matter fields with hypercharge has the opposite effect on @xmath24 and does not improve the unification . ] in other words , the gauge coupling unification is realized in the original basis where the kinetic mixing is manifest .",
    "we shall return to the origin of such kinetic mixing later in this section .    in the canonical basis , @xmath12 has the fractional u(1)@xmath3 charge and its effect is captured by the beta - functions of the gauge couplings .",
    "the actual calculations to be given in the next subsection are based on the two - loop rg equations , but let us give the one - loop rg equations below to get the feeling of how the gauge couplings evolve .",
    "the one - loop beta - functions of the gauge couplings in the canonical basis are given by  @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is a renormalization scale ) and @xmath33 on the other hand , the beta - functions of the gauge couplings and the kinetic mixing parameter in the original basis take a surprisingly simple form . by using eq.([eq : rge1 ] ) , the beta - functions in the original basis are written as @xmath34.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the rg running of @xmath16 does not depend on @xmath17 nor @xmath2 at the one - loop level , although its normalization is fixed by @xmath2 .",
    "at the two - loop level , this property does not hold and the rg running of @xmath16 depends on @xmath17 and @xmath2 ( see in appendix [ appb ] ) . however , the dependence is still weak due to the loop suppression factor , and we have confirmed this numerically .",
    "therefore , because of rather weak dependence on @xmath17 and @xmath2 , the gauge coupling unification is essentially determined by the size of @xmath2 .",
    "now we study the rg runnings of the gauge couplings using two - loop beta - functions , in order to see if the sm gauge couplings unify at the high - energy scale .",
    "the two - loop beta - functions are obtained by utilizing pyr@te 2 package  @xcite , and the numerical results shown in this section are based on solving the rg equations at two - loop order unless otherwise stated .",
    "let us first study the case without extra matter fields by solving the rg equations at the two - loop order .",

    "the beta - functions of the gauge couplings at the one - loop level are given by @xmath35 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the gauge couplings of su(2)@xmath36 and su(3)@xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the hidden gauge coupling does not run in this case . in fig.[fig:1 ] , we plot the rg running of @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . the black solid",

    "however , as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is no phenomenological implications for low - energy physics ( except for suppressed proton decay rates ) , since the massless hidden photon is decoupled from the sm sector , and the hidden u(1)@xmath1 simply changes the normalization of the u(1)@xmath3 gauge coupling . in particular , from the low - energy physics point of view , there is no way to determine the correct basis at the high energy except for requiring the successful gauge coupling unification , since any basis appears to be on an equal footing .",

    "finally , let us comment on the origin of the kinetic mixing @xmath2 and a possible modification of the unified gauge coupling .",
    "we have seen that a relatively large @xmath83 is necessary to improve the gauge coupling unification .",
    "such a large kinetic mixing may be generated via an operator , @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a gut breaking higgs and @xmath86 with @xmath87gev ; @xmath88 is a cut - off scale .",
    "then , the kinetic mixing is given by @xmath89 for @xmath90gev , the induced kinetic mixing is naturally of @xmath91 , as required for the successful unification .",
    "we also note that there could also exist an operator , @xmath92 which modifies the unified gauge coupling .",
    "it leads to the following deviations , @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the squared of the unified coupling divided by 4@xmath95 . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath96 , the deviation , @xmath97 , is within 5% level while obtaining the large kinetic mixing of @xmath61 .",
    "let us suppose that there is a field , @xmath98 , which is charged only under u(1)@xmath1 in the original basis .",
    "then , the field acquires an electric charge @xmath99 proportional to the hidden gauge coupling @xmath17 , and so , if @xmath17 is tiny , it becomes a minicharged particle .",
    "since the stability of @xmath98 is ensured by the u(1)@xmath1 , such minicharged particle can be a good candidate for dark matter . in order to account for dark matter",
    ", such minicharged particles must be somehow produced in the early universe .",
    "as long as we assume thermal production through electromagnetic interactions , however , they can not be a dominant component of the dark matter .",
    "this is because the astrophysical constraints  @xcite and the direct detection constraint  @xcite  @xcite : @xmath100 since the minicharged particle may be evacuated from the galactic disk by the supernova shock waves and galactic magnetic fields  @xcite . ] on the minicharged particle exclude the region where the thermal relic abundance is consistent with the observed dark matter abundance . to obtain the correct thermal relic abundance without running afoul of astrophysical and direct detection constraints",
    ", one needs to include additional interactions between the minicharged particles and the sm sector .    to be concrete , we consider the following higgs portal interactions  @xcite : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a sm higgs doublet , @xmath103 is some mass scale , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are respectively a complex scalar and a dirac fermion with a unit u(1)@xmath1 charge , and @xmath106 and @xmath107 are their masses . in the canonical basis , @xmath104 and @xmath105 have an electric charges of @xmath108 if @xmath109 , the correct abundance is obtained for @xmath110 and @xmath111 or @xmath112gev@xmath113 and @xmath1141 - 10tev  @xcite , avoiding the constraint from the lux experiment  @xcite .",
    "as long as the electric charge @xmath115 is sufficiently small , this allowed region does not depend on @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , the minicharged dark matter can explain the observed dark matter if it has a higgs portal coupling .",
    "the minicharge of dark matter is constrained by various observations .",
    "first , if the minicharged dark matter is tightly coupled to the photon - baryon plasma during recombination , the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies is modified and it becomes inconsistent with observations  @xcite . requiring that the dark matter is completely decoupled from the plasma at the recombination epoch , an upper - bound on @xmath99 is obtained as  @xcite @xmath116 .",
    "direct detection experiments give even tighter constraints . from the lux experiment  @xcite ,",
    "the constraint on @xmath99 is  @xcite latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }    note that this lux constraint can be applied to very heavy minicharged dark matter .",
    "finally , let us comment on an alternative production of the minicharged dark matter .",
    "the minicharged particle may have an interaction with a heavy particle ( e.g. inflaton ) , and the correct relic abundance may be obtained by non - thermal productions via the interaction .",
    "for instance , if the inflaton has a quartic coupling with @xmath104 , and oscillates about the origin where the @xmath104 becomes ( almost ) massless , a preheating process could take place . for certain coupling and the mass of @xmath104 , the right abundance of @xmath104 can be generated .",
    "one way to suppress the overproduction of @xmath104 is consider a minicharged dark matter of a heavy mass .",
    "such scenario is also consistent with the phenomenological constraints as long as the electric charge is small enough .",
    "we have investigated the gauge coupling unification in the presence of an unbroken hidden u(1)@xmath1 symmetry , which mixes with the u(1)@xmath3 of the sm gauge group . by solving the two - loop rg equations ,",
    "we have found the gauge coupling unification is achieved with a better accuracy if the size of the kinetic mixing is @xmath4 at the z boson mass scale .",
    "the unification scale is around @xmath0gev , which is large enough to avoid the rapid proton decay . interestingly ,",
    "the unification behavior is essentially determined by the kinetic mixing parameter only , and it is rather insensitive to the size of the hidden gauge coupling or the presence of the vector - like fermions charged under u(1)@xmath1 and/or su(5 ) .",
    "this implies that the vector - like masses can be arbitrarily light ( or heavy ) without affecting the gauge coupling unification .",
    "the above findings imply that the peccei - quinn mechanism to the strong cp - problem  @xcite can be easily embedded into our setup : if the vector - like fermion of the su(5 ) complete multiplet is coupled to a peccei - quinn scalar , it induces the required color anomaly  @xcite .",
    "the gauge coupling unification is preserved irrespective of the axion decay constant , which is typically around the intermediate scale .",
    "interestingly , if the vector - like fermion has a hidden u(1 ) charge , the axion is coupled to the hidden photon , and the axion will be a portal to the hidden photon . in this case ,",
    "the dark matter could be composed of both the qcd axion and the minicharged dark matter .",
    "we have shown that the u(1)@xmath1 gauge coupling can be arbitrarily small while keeping the successful unification . in this case",
    ", a hidden particle charged under u(1)@xmath1 has a tiny electric charge due to the kinetic mixing .",
