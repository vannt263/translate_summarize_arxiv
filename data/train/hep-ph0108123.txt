    "the implications of neutrino masses in cosmology and astrophysics are numerous .",
    "one fascinating effect , is that of relic neutrino asymmetries , which may be produced if there is mixing between active and sterile neutrino species @xcite .",
    "neutrino asymmetries are interesting since they affect big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , altering the primordial helium yield .",
    "bbn is particularly sensitive to an asymmetry between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "additionally , since the matter potential arising from forward scattering is proportional to the asymmetry , a large asymmetry will suppress active - sterile oscillation modes which could otherwise equilibrate sterile neutrino species around the time of bbn .",
    "first consider two - flavour mixing between an active neutrino , @xmath2 , and a sterile neutrino , @xmath3 . for each neutrino flavour",
    "we define an asymmetry @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the neutrino and photon number densities , respectively .",
    "the neutrino momentum distributions , @xmath7 , are such that @xmath8 and in thermal equilibrium are just given by fermi - dirac distributions @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the temperature and @xmath11 , with @xmath12 being the neutrino chemical potential . in equilibrium , @xmath13 is related to @xmath12 as per @xmath14.\\ ] ]    we wish to track @xmath13 as the universe evolves , with the period of interest being the epoch between @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the evolution of the neutrino ensemble will be controlled by ( i ) oscillations , ( ii ) collisions of the neutrinos with other particles , resulting in decoherence of the oscillations , and ( iii ) the expansion of the universe , which redshifts energies and momenta .",
    "the matter affected mixing angle , @xmath17 , is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mixing angle in vacuum .",
    "the term @xmath20 arises from the effective matter potential @xmath21 , where -/+ corresponds to @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the mass squared difference of the two neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "the functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 are given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is due to the baryon asymmetry . note that the mixing angle is dependent on the size of the asymmetry , which makes the evolution of the asymmetry non - linear .",
    "there are two distinct phases in the growth of a neutrino asymmetry .",
    "the first is a collision dominated stage , which occurs at high temperature .",
    "the total collision rate of a @xmath0 ( @xmath31 or @xmath32 ) of momentum @xmath33 with particles in the background plasma is approximately @xmath34 these collisions tend to destroy the coherent superposition of flavour states . in this regime , it can be shown that the growth of the neutrino asymmetry is governed by the equation @xmath35[x+(c - b - a)^2]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ^ 2 , \\;\\;\\ ; n^{+ } = \\frac{1}{2}(n_{\\nu}+ n_{\\overline{\\nu}}).\\ ] ] eq.([hightemp ] ) can be derived either from a heuristic picture @xcite that views collisions as measurement - like interactions , or can be extracted from the exact quantum kinetic equations @xcite .",
    "it is valid when the collision rate is large and the evolution is adiabatic - see @xcite for details .    note that @xmath39 , which can lead to runaway positive feedback and thus rapid growth of @xmath13 .",
    "the mixing parameters for which this occurs are specified by @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and we require lighter of the two mass eigenstates to approximately coincide with the @xmath3 . typically , the asymmetry will reach values @xmath42 in this phase . note that the sign of the asymmetry , which depends on the initial conditions , can be ambiguous @xcite .",
    "the second phase is that lower temperature .",
    "here the collisions are less important , and coherent msw transitions drive the asymmetry to values @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "if , for example , the asymmetry is positive , the neutrino msw resonance occurs at a much higher momentum value than that of the antineutrinos and may be neglected .",
    "the rate at which the asymmetry grows is then @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the difference between the number of @xmath46 and @xmath47 at the resonance .",
    "eq.([res ] ) quantifies the rate at which the resonance moves through the momentum distribution , and holds when transitions are adiabatic and the resonance width is small .",
    "we wish to determine the impact of such asymmetry production on the bbn light element abundances , and in particular , on the helium yield . in general , the results are somewhat model dependent ( compare , say , @xcite with @xcite . )",
    "the results are particularly sensitive to the size of the @xmath0 asymmetry , which directly affects the neutron / proton ratio through the reaction rates @xmath48 the n / p ratio determines the helium mass fraction @xmath49 via the equation @xmath50    for typical values of @xmath23 , one must compute the growth of the asymmetry and the effect on bbn simultaneously , as the asymmetries will not have reached their final values before the bbn epoch commences .",
    "momentum modes which are depleted due to the oscillations , are refilled by scattering and annihilation processes as per @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the equilibrium distribution in eq.([nic ] ) , and @xmath53 .",
    "the example we consider is a particular `` 2 + 2 '' style 4-neutrino model , consisting of a maximally mixed @xmath54 pair , separated by a mass gap from @xmath55 .",
    "the oscillations modes most important in the evolution of the various flavour neutrino asymmetries will be the ones with the largest @xmath23 .",
    "specifically , the @xmath56 oscillation modes will create large @xmath57 and @xmath58 asymmetries , and the @xmath59 oscillation modes will transfer a small amount of this asymmetry to the electron neutrinos . see @xcite for further details .      integrating the bbn reaction rates , eq . (",
    "[ eq : rates ] ) , the direct effect of the @xmath0 asymmetry on the @xmath62 ratio , and hence @xmath49 , is determined .",
    "we obtain @xmath63 , corresponding to an effective change in the number of neutrinos of @xmath64 .",
    "in addition , there is a small direct change to the energy density , leading overall to @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "the value of @xmath67 obtained in this way must then be compared with that calculated from the observed light abundances @xcite .",
    "it is not yet clear whether the observed helium and deuterium abundances can be accommodated within the standard bbn scenario with @xmath68 , and it is possible that a small @xmath0 asymmetry such as that discussed here would help to provide a better fit @xcite .",
    "recent measurement of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) anisotropy also provides a determination of the number of neutrinos in the early universe @xcite , although the constraints are , as yet , not as strong as those arising from bbn .",
    "asymmetry , while the cmbr measures the total energy density residing in neutrinos ( at a much later epoch of the universe . ) ] however , future measurements are expected to pin down the effective neutrino number very precisely @xcite and thus will be of great use in constraining models which feature the mixing of active and sterile neutrinos .          n. f. bell , r. r. volkas and y. y. y. wong , phys . rev .",
