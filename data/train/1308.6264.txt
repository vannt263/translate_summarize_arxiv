    "<S> the modern form of the moments method applied to the calculation of the nuclear shell - model level density is explained and examples of the method at work are given . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated level density practically exactly coincides with the result of full diagonalization when the latter is feasible . </S>",
    "<S> the method provides the pure level density for given spin and parity with spurious center - of - mass excitations subtracted . </S>",
    "<S> the presence and interplay of all correlations leads to the results different from those obtained by the mean - field combinatorics .    </S>",
    "<S> the long - standing problem of nuclear level density is important both from a theoretical viewpoint as a powerful instrument for studying nuclear structure and for numerous applications . </S>",
    "<S> nuclear technology requires the detailed knowledge of level density , especially in the region around the neutron separation energy . </S>",
    "<S> astrophysical reactions responsible for the nucleosynthesis in the universe can be understood only if we know the nuclear level density in the gamow window . </S>",
    "<S> the interest to this problem is also connected with the necessity to develop methods of statistical physics and thermodynamics for small _ mesoscopic _ systems ( complex nuclei , atoms and molecules , nanoscale devices , prototypes of quantum computers ) .    </S>",
    "<S> application of statistical physics to studies of nuclear properties was started in the early years of nuclear physics by frenkel @xcite , bethe @xcite and landau @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such ideas served as a base for a concept of compound nucleus by bohr @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the review of those ideas and their further development was given in refs . @xcite . at this stage theory of level density and detailed microscopic nuclear theory </S>",
    "<S> were growing more or less independently along parallel paths . </S>",
    "<S> their synthesis became possible when the reliable versions of the nuclear shell model were established for several segments of the nuclear chart . </S>",
    "<S> of course , this is related to the modern computational tools .    in this presentation </S>",
    "<S> we show the practical way of finding the density of energy levels with fixed exact quantum numbers ( spin , parity , isospin projection ) for a given shell model hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the method becomes practical because it is avoiding the full diagonalization of prohibitively large matrices . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to popular mean - field approaches @xcite , all many - body correlations are fully accounted for , albeit in a restricted orbital space . </S>",
    "<S> the exact classification of states according to the conserved quantities and therefore the absence of artificial standard spin cut - off parameters is the advantage compared to monte - carlo calculations although some of them give relatively good results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar problems still may arise in approaches based on statistical spectroscopy @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our method was gradually developed in several publications @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a high - performance code for calculating spin- and parity - dependent level density is available via the computer physics communication homepage on science direct @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> technically we use the _ moments method _ based on statistical spectroscopy @xcite , the applications are compared to the results obtained with the full diagonalization in the nuclear shell model with effective interactions when such calculations are practically possible @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the method is reinforced by the use of the recurrence relations @xcite for eliminating spurious contributions .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with the shell - model hamiltonian that contains mean - field single - particle energies in the restricted space and effective two - body interactions ( many - body forces can be added without problems although the equations become more cumbersome ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spherical orbitals @xmath0 are used as a basis , and the counted many - body levels have definite total spin @xmath1 and parity . </S>",
    "<S> a certain distribution of non - interacting particles over orbitals defines a configuration ( _ partition _ ) . for each partition @xmath2 , let @xmath3 be the number of many - body states with exact quantum numbers @xmath4 including the number of particles , spin , parity , isospin ... the _ diagonal _ matrix elements of the total ( including interaction ) hamiltonian define the energy _ </S>",
    "<S> centroid _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 for the states of class @xmath6 built in the partition @xmath2 , @xmath7 for each partition we define also the effective _ width _ ( energy dispersion ) @xmath8 , @xmath9    the contribution of each state to this width , related to the strength function of an unperturbed state fragmented over the exact eigenstates , can be found summing the squares of off - diagonal matrix elements of the full hamiltonian over a given row of the matrix @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> here the interaction between the states of different partitions is fully accounted for . as known from the shell - model experience @xcite , the centroids of partitions form a smooth sequence , while the widths of individual unperturbed states fluctuate only weakly which can be considered as one of features of quantum chaos ( in particular , _ geometric chaoticity _ of angular momentum addition @xcite , that emerges , for a realistic strength of interactions , already at rather low excitation energy ) . </S>",
    "<S> the details of calculating the trace of @xmath11 and explanation of the computational algorithm can be found in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ; a computational method based on group theory but close in spirit to our approach is presented in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the set of quantities ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) forms a foundation of the moments method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the level density of each partition is known @xcite to be close to gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> the first two moments define it with sufficient precision . </S>",
    "<S> the total level density is restored by summing the contributions of the partitions , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a _ finite range gaussian _ with the centroid at @xmath5 counted from the ground state energy ; this gaussian is cut at a distance @xmath14 from the centroid , where @xmath15 is an empirical parameter eliminating the unphysical tails of the gaussian ( there are theoretical arguments confirmed by experience that fix @xmath15 between 2.5 and 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state energy is to be found independently , for example by the approximate diagonalization in a smaller space and the exponential convergence method @xcite , where the exponential regime also starts approximately at a distance of 3 - 4 spreading widths .    </S>",
    "<S> the last essential point is exclusion of unphysical states corresponding to the center - of - mass excitation which are present in the shell - model calculations due to cross - shell mixing . </S>",
    "<S> if we classify the basis states similarly to the harmonic oscillator field by @xmath16 excitations , then for @xmath17 the spurious excitations are absent , @xmath18 . with @xmath19 excitations we have to subtract from the shell - model </S>",
    "<S> result the states which could be obtained by the action of the center - of - mass vector operator on all states of @xmath17 class , @xmath20 the final result is expressed by a recurrent relation similar to used in @xcite : @xmath21     @xmath22ge nuclear level density for @xmath23 and positive parity . </S>",
    "<S> solid and dashed lines present calculations by moments method in @xmath24- ( calculated with gxpf1a interaction ) and @xmath25-model spaces correspondingly . </S>",

    "<S> the results for a larger orbital space , @xmath25 shells , only slightly exceed those for the @xmath24 space . </S>",
    "<S> however , as it is typical for all our calculations , the shell - model level density is very smooth as a function of energy and turns out to be much lower than what can be found from the tables @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the preliminary conclusion is that the full set of effective shell - model interactions responsible for emergence of quantum chaos is very important smoothing the results based mainly on the mean - field combinatorics .     </S>",
