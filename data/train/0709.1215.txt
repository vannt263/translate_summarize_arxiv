    "this requires going to a completion @xmath3 of @xmath39 , and can only be done partially .",
    "nevertheless , the represented semigroup contains enough structure to derive laplace - casimir differential equations for its character .",
    "our explicit formula for @xmath31 looks exactly like a classical weyl formula and is derived in terms of the roots of the lie superalgebra @xmath13 and the weyl group @xmath40 .",
    "let us state this formula for @xmath0 , @xmath20 without going into the details of the @xmath41-positive even and odd roots @xmath42 and @xmath43 and the weyl group @xmath40 ( see @xmath44[sect : weylgroup ] for precise formulas ) .",

    "in published recent work @xcite the same formula was derived under the more restrictive condition @xmath75 . in @xcite",
    "this unwanted restriction on the parameter range came about because the numerator and denominator on the left - hand side were expanded _ separately _ , ignoring the supersymmetric howe duality ( see @xmath44[sect : osp - howe ] of the present paper ) of the problem at hand .    for @xmath76 the same induction process starting from ( [ eq : weylcharacter ] )",

    "now , howe duality ( proposition [ prop : howeduality ] ) implies that @xmath37 is the representation space for an irreducible highest - weight representation @xmath96 of the howe dual partner @xmath13 of @xmath11 in the orthosymplectic lie superalgebra @xmath97 .",
    "this representation @xmath96 is constructed by realizing @xmath98 as a subalgebra in the space of degree - two elements of the clifford - weyl algebra @xmath99 .",

    "namely , if @xmath105 , then @xmath106 and @xmath107 for all @xmath108 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath109 are the dimensions of the weight spaces ( multiplied by parity ) .",
    "note that the set of weights of the representation @xmath110 of @xmath13 on @xmath37 is infinite .      before outlining the strategy for computing our character in the infinite - dimensional setting of representations of lie superalgebras and groups , we recall the classical situation where @xmath110 is an irreducible finite - dimensional representation of a reductive lie algebra @xmath13 and @xmath84",
    "is the corresponding lie group representation of the complex reductive group @xmath33 . in that case",
    "the character @xmath111 of @xmath84 , which automatically exists , is the trace @xmath112 , which is a radial eigenfunction of every laplace - casimir operator .",
    "these differential equations can be completely understood by their behavior on a maximal torus of @xmath33 .    in our case",
    "we must consider the infinite - dimensional irreducible representation @xmath110 of the lie superalgebra @xmath113 on @xmath37 .",
    "casimir elements , laplace - casimir operators of @xmath6 , and their radial parts have been described by berezin @xcite . in the situation @xmath114 at hand",

    "if we had a representation @xmath123 of a lie supergroup @xmath124 at our disposal , we could define @xmath119 to be its character , i.e. @xmath125 ( see @xmath44[supergroup characters ] ) . since we do nt have such a representation ,",
    "our idea is to define @xmath119 as a character on a totally real submanifold @xmath126 of maximal dimension which contains a real form of @xmath120 and is invariant with respect to conjugation by a real form @xmath127 of @xmath128 , and then to extend @xmath119 by analytic continuation .",
    "thinking classically we consider the even part of the lie superalgebra @xmath129 , which is the lie algebra @xmath130 .",
    "the real structures at the lie supergroup level come from a real form @xmath131 of @xmath132 .",
    "the associated real forms of @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the real orthogonal lie algebra @xmath135 and the real symplectic lie algebra @xmath136 .",

    "we frequently use the unitary representation of the real heisenberg group @xmath139 on the completion @xmath3 of the module @xmath38 .",
    "since @xmath140 has finite dimension , exponentiating the spinor representation of @xmath135 causes no difficulties .",
    "this results in the spinor representation of @xmath141 , a 2:1 covering of the compact group @xmath142 .",
    "so in this case one easily constructs a representation @xmath143 which is compatible with @xmath144 .",
    "exponentiating the oscillator representation of @xmath145 on the infinite - dimensional vector space @xmath146 requires more effort . in @xmath44[metaplectic rep",
    "] , following howe @xcite , we construct the shale - weil - segal representation @xmath147 of the metaplectic group @xmath148 which is the 2:1 covering group of the real symplectic group @xmath149 .",
    "this is compatible with @xmath150 .",
    "altogether we see that the even part of the lie superalgebra representation integrates to @xmath151 .",
    "the construction of @xmath152 uses a limiting process coming from the oscillator semigroup @xmath153 , which is the double covering of the contraction semigroup @xmath154 and has @xmath155 in its boundary .",
    "furthermore , we have @xmath156 where @xmath126 is an analytic totally real submanifold of maximal dimension which contains a real form of the torus @xmath157 ( see @xmath44[oscillator semigroup ] ) .",
    "the representation @xmath158 constructed in @xmath44[sec : semigrouprep ] facilitates the definition of the representation @xmath152 and of the character @xmath119 in @xmath44[subsec : existence ] .",
    "it should be underlined that proposition [ holomorphicity ] ensures convergence of the superfunction @xmath159 , which is defined as a supertrace and exists for all @xmath160 .",
    "on that basis , the key idea of our approach is to exploit the fact that every casimir invariant @xmath161 is exact in the sense that @xmath162 $ ] . by a standard argument",
    ", this exactness property implies that every such invariant @xmath115 vanishes in the spinor - oscillator representation .",
    "this result in turn implies for our character @xmath119 the differential equations @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the laplace - casimir operator representing @xmath115 . by drawing on berezin s theory of radial parts",
    ", we derive a system of differential equations which in combination with certain other properties ultimately determines @xmath119 .    in the case of @xmath81 the lie group associated to the even part of the real form of the howe partner @xmath13 is embedded in a simple way in the full group @xmath127 described above .",
    "it is itself just a lower - dimensional group of the same form . in the case of @xmath52",
    "a sort of reversing procedure takes places and the analogous real form is @xmath165 .",
    "nevertheless , the precise data which are used as input into the series developments , the uniqueness theorem and the final calculations of @xmath119 are essentially the same in the two cases .",
    "therefore there is no difficulty handling them simultaneously .",
    "in this chapter we collect some foundational information from representation theory .",

    "for this we use the same notation as above for the basic linear functions , namely @xmath2583 and @xmath2584 . here , compared to the @xmath55 case , there are only slight differences in the @xmath41-positive roots and the weyl group .",
    "the only difference in the roots is in @xmath2585 where @xmath2586 occurs in the larger range @xmath2587 and @xmath2528 in the smaller range @xmath2588 .",
    "the weyl group acts by permutation of indices on both the @xmath2589 and @xmath2322 and by sign reversal on the @xmath2590 . in this case , as opposed to the case above where only an even number of sign reversals were allowed , every sign reversal transformation is in the weyl group .    in order to prove lemma [ constraints fulfilled ] in this case",
    ", we need only go through the argument in the @xmath55 case and make minor adjustments .",
    "in fact , the main step is to prove lemma [ m_1 estimate ] and , there , the only change is that the range of @xmath2591 for the factor @xmath2592 is larger .",
    "this is only relevant in the case @xmath2593 , where we rewrite the additional denominator term @xmath2594 as @xmath2595 .",
    "hence the factor in front of the ratio of products on the r.h.s .  of equation ( [ eq:4.7mrz ] ) gets an additional factor of @xmath2596 and now is @xmath2597 .",
    "thus @xmath2598 which certainly implies @xmath2599 .",
    "moreover , using the fact that the weyl group transformations for @xmath2175 always involve an even number of sign changes , one sees that @xmath2362 in that case . as a consequence of the uniqueness theorem ( theorem [ unicity ] ) we therefore have @xmath2602 \\in w / w_\\lambda }      \\mathrm{e}^{w(\\lambda_n)}\\frac{\\prod_{\\beta\\in\\delta_{\\lambda,1}^+ }      ( 1 - \\mathrm{e}^{-w(\\beta)})}{\\prod_{\\alpha\\in\\delta_{\\lambda,0}^+ }      ( 1 - \\mathrm{e}^{-w(\\alpha)})}\\ ] ] in both the @xmath55 and @xmath20 cases . since the @xmath57 case has been handled as a consequence of the result for @xmath2603 , our work is now complete .",
