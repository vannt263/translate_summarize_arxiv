    "the metallicity of the sun ( both the mix of heavy elements , and the total mass - fraction abundance , @xmath0 ) is presently a subject of considerable controversy . until a few years ago ,",
    "the generally accepted value of @xmath3 was @xmath70.02 , and there was good consistency between the predictions of standard solar models ( ssms ) for metallicities within this range ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) and the measured neutrino flux as well as helioseismological data . however , significantly reduced abundances for several of the most abundant heavy elements ( including c , n , o , and ne ) , resulting in @xmath5 , have been derived by m.  asplund and collaborators from their analyses of the photospheric spectrum using 3-d , non - lte model atmospheres ( see @xcite ; and references therein ) . whereas high-@xmath0 solar models are able to reproduce the inferred radial dependence of the square of the sound speed ( down to @xmath8 ) from solar oscillations to @xmath9% ( see @xcite ) , those computed for the asplund et al .",
    "metallicity are unable to do so to better than @xmath10% ( e.g. , ( @xcite ) .",
    "it seems unlikely that this difficulty is due to problems with current opacities ( @xcite ) or the presently accepted rates of diffusive processes ( @xcite ) . as noted by @xcite , any substantial increases to the diffusion coefficients that are made in order to recover good agreement with the inferred sound speed profile result in predictions for the surface helium content of the sun that are below the values obtained by the inversion of solar oscillations .",
    "in fact , turbulent mixing processes appear to operate in stellar envelopes to _ reduce _ the effects of diffusion on the surface abundances of @xmath11 main - sequence ( ms ) stars ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .    while the low solar @xmath0 derived by asplund et al",
    ".  may be erroneous , the 3-d model atmospheres used in their studies have had unprecedented success in modelling the properties of the solar atmosphere ( see @xcite ) , and the predicted spectral line profiles based on these atmospheres provide superb matches to the observed profiles ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the reduced abundances of the cno elements are in excellent agreement with the values measured in the interstellar medium ( @xcite ) and in solar neighborhood b stars ( see @xcite ; and references therein ) . thus , their findings are not easily dismissed .",
    "there is another , albeit indirect , way of constraining the metallicity of the sun that has not yet been investigated .",
    "the large reduction in the cno and ne abundances found by asplund et al .  ( relative to previous estimates ) affects the mass at which a transition is made between stars that have radiative cores during the ms phase and those possessing convective cores when their central hydrogen fuel is exhausted .",
    "consequently , a cluster like m@xmath267 , which has [ m / h ] @xmath12 and turnoff stars with masses close to the transition mass , @xmath13 , provides a probe of both stellar physics _ and _ the chemical composition of the material out of which the stars formed . as shown by @xcite , @xmath13",
    "is predicted to increase with decreasing metal abundance , and to be a fairly sensitive function of @xmath0 ( see their fig .",
    "2 ) . whether or not an old open cluster is expected to have a gap in its distribution of near - turnoff stars on the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd )",
    "will therefore depend on its metallicity .",
    "( a gap is the observational manifestation of the rapid contraction phase that accompanies the exhaustion of hydrogen in stars that have convective cores at the end of their ms lifetimes . )",
    "the m@xmath267 cmd ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) contains such a gap , and stellar models for @xmath14 have been quite successful in reproducing these data . @xcite",
    "have shown that a 4.0 gyr isochrone for @xmath15 , assuming the @xcite metal abundances , provides a satisfactory match to the cluster cmd , if a small amount of convective core overshooting is assumed ( also see vbd06 ) .",
    "a nearly identical fit was obtained by @xcite using diffusive isochrones for 3.7 gyr and @xmath16 , without having to postulate any core overshooting .",
    "these calculations predict that the cluster ms stars have @xmath1712% surface underabundances of the metals , depending on their temperatures  compared with a @xmath18% reduction in the case of the sun ( @xcite ) , which is much too small to simulate the difference between the asplund et al .",
    "solar composition and that reported by , e.g. , grevesse & noels .",
    "given the apparent success of relatively metal - rich models in explaining the cmd of m@xmath267 , which has very close to the solar metallicity , is it possible for @xmath19 isochrones to provide a comparable fit ?",
    "this is the question that has motivated the present investigation .",
    "the evolutionary tracks needed for this investigation have been computed using the victoria stellar evolution code ( see vbd06 , and references therein ) .",
    "model atmospheres produced by the latest version of the marcs code ( e.g. , @xcite ) have been used as boundary conditions .",
    "[ differences in the treatment of the surface layers do not alter the tracks for the ms and early subgiant branch ( sgb ) phases of solar metallicity stars in any significant way if the value of the mixing - length parameter , @xmath20 , is chosen so that the solar constraint is satisfied ( see , e.g. , fig .  3 in the study by @xcite ) .",
    "the assumed value of @xmath20 does affect the predicted location of the red - giant branch ( rgb ) , but that is not a concern for the present work . ]    the standard abundance distribution reported by @xcite , as determined from analyses of solar photospheric spectra and meteoritic data using classical 1-d hydrostatic models , was the last such compilation prior to the use of 3-d hydrodynamical model atmospheres by asplund et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to determine the solar composition .",
    "the gs98 abundances for the 19 metals normally considered in stellar evolutionary computations ( because they are the only heavy elements that are taken into account in the calculation of opal opacities for stellar interior conditions ; see @xcite ) are listed in the second column of table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "the third column contains the the abundance distribution that is obtained when the revised values derived by asplund et al .  for several of the heavy elements",
    "are adopted : note that the c and n abundances in table  [ tab : tab1 ] are 0.02 dex higher than their published 2006 estimates .",
    "opal opacities were computed for both heavy - element mixtures using the livermore laboratory website facility ( see http://www-phys.llnl.gov/research/opal ) . because these calculations do not include the contributions from molecular sources or grains , complementary opacity data for @xmath21 k",
    "were computed for the same abundances using the code described by @xcite .",
    "the tabulated values of @xmath22 were obtained from ssms that were constructed for the two sets of abundances : the resultant values of @xmath23 and @xmath0 are listed in the last two rows of table  [ tab : tab1 ] . to satisfy the solar constraint , the @xmath24 models for the gs98 and asplund et al .",
    "abundances required @xmath25 and 1.80 , respectively ( when marcs model atmospheres are used as boundary conditions ; see @xcite ) .",
    "the value of @xmath13 is a function of @xmath0 ( especially the cno abundances ; see below ) .",
    "the transition occurs when the cno - cycle becomes an important source of nuclear energy production , and since both the decrease in the _ abundances _ of the cno elements and the concomitant reduction in opacity will serve to reduce the rate of the cno - cycle , the minimum mass for sustained core convection on the ms is higher in stars of lower @xmath0 . by trial and error ,",
    "@xmath13 was found to be @xmath26 if @xmath27 ( asplund et al .",
    "metals mix ) , whereas @xmath28 is obtained if @xmath29 ( gs98 metal abundances ) .",
    "[ the transition mass also depends on the adopted helium content ; e.g. , @xmath30 if @xmath19 and the value of @xmath23 required by an ssm for @xmath31 is assumed ( i.e. , @xmath32 ; see table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) . ]    indeed , the character of the tracks changes abruptly when core convection persists until h exhaustion .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : vfig1 ] , which plots the evolutionary tracks for 1.0@xmath4 that were computed for the two values of @xmath3 ; including , in particular , sequences for @xmath13 and @xmath33 .",
    "each of the higher mass tracks possesses a blueward hook , which arises when a star contracts following the depletion of hydrogen in a convective core in order to ignite h - burning in a shell around the he core .",
    "this morphology is not seen in the lower mass tracks because the central regions are radiative when hydrogen is exhausted and there is a smooth transition to h shell burning .",
    "a difference of @xmath34 in @xmath13 is surprisingly large given that vbd06 found an increase of only @xmath35 when @xmath0 was decreased from 0.0173 to 0.0125 .",
    "however , the latter calculations assumed the same relative abundances of the metals ( those given by @xcite ) , whereas the tracks plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : vfig1 ] assume two very different heavy - element mixtures .",
    "indeed , a large reduction in the cno abundances is mainly responsible for the downward revision of the solar value of @xmath0 from 0.0165 ( gs98 ) to 0.0125 ( asplund et al . )  which demonstrates that @xmath13 is a strong function of the abundances of the cno elements .",
    "an increase in @xmath13 from 1.155 to @xmath26 will be accompanied by a decrease in the maximum age at which a gap near the turnoff is expected in an observed cmd .",
    "[ fig : vfig1 ] shows that the biggest differences between the two sets of models occur at masses of @xmath36 . because @xmath13 is lower in the case of the gs98 computations , and",
    "because the amount of overshooting in stars of mass @xmath37 is assumed to vary directly with @xmath38 ( see vbd06 ) , the tracks represented by the dashed curves for masses of 1.2@xmath4 have larger convective cores during ms evolution , and cooler blueward hooks at h exhaustion , than those plotted as solid curves .",
    "such differences will impact the isochrones ( computed in this study using the interpolation software described by vbd06 ) and the degree to which they are able to reproduce the m@xmath267 cmd .",
    "according to high - resolution spectroscopy , m@xmath267 has [ fe / h ] @xmath39 ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) . for the cluster reddening , we have adopted @xmath40 mag , as found from the @xcite dust maps :",
    "this estimate is probably accurate to within @xmath41 mag , given that it agrees so well with the values derived using alternative methods ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) . as far as the distance is concerned",
    ", the modulus that is obtained from a main - sequence fit of the dereddened photometry to the lower ms segments of our isochrones should also be quite accurate ( probably to within @xmath42 mag ) because the model temperatures satisfy the solar constraint and the adopted color transformations ( by @xcite ) are in very good agreement with the empirical relations derived by @xcite from their study of solar neighborhood stars having well - determined properties ( see the vandenberg & clem paper ) .",
    "the application of the ms - fitting technique yields @xmath43 .    with these choices for the basic parameters of m@xmath267 , the isochrone for each value of @xmath3 that provides the best fit to the subgiants is readily identified .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : vfig2 ] , the 3.9 gyr isochrone for @xmath31 ( gs98 metal abundances ) provides a good match to the morphology of the m@xmath267 cmd all the way from the zams to the base of the giant branch , including , in particular , the location of the gap near the turnoff .",
    "( many of the stars just brighter than the gap , at @xmath44 , are presumably binaries , given that m@xmath267 is known to have an unusually large binarity fraction ; at least 63% , according to montgomery et al .",
    "the @xmath45 mag offset in color at a given @xmath46 along the lower rgb is discussed by vandenberg et al .",
    "2007 . ) in stark contrast with this , the 4.2 gyr isochrone for @xmath19 ( the asplund et al .",
    "metallicity ) fails to reproduce the location of the near - turnoff stars of m@xmath267 , despite providing a comparably good fit to the zams and the sgb .",
    "this isochrone shows no indication at all of a blueward hook feature , and thus it does not predict a gap in the distribution of stars near the turnoff where one is observed . ) in the cmd published by @xcite for the high - probability single - star members .",
    "moreover , the observed distribution of single stars along the cluster fiducial sequence ( see sandquist s fig .",
    "14 ) is very reminiscent of that predicted by best - fitting isochrones ( see fig .",
    "14 in the study by @xcite ) .",
    "[ the cmd obtained by sandquist is not used here because he did not provide @xmath47 photometry ( only @xmath48 ) , and his @xmath49 colors , but not his @xmath50 magnitudes , are at odds with other measurements ( see the discussion by @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps the main advantage of using @xmath47 data in our analysis is that , as mentioned above , the @xmath51@xmath52 relations that have been used to transpose the models to the observed plane appear to be especially reliable . ] ]    the oldest isochrone in the @xmath19 set that has the required turnoff morphology is one for an age of 3.6 gyr , and indeed , it provides a satisfactory fit to the cmd of m@xmath267 if @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "however , such a high reddening seems to be ruled out and it is doubtful that the model colors are in error by as much as 0.03 mag .",
    "isochrones for the asplund metallicity thus appear to pose similar difficulties for our understanding of m@xmath267 as for helioseismology , in the sense that _ stellar models with higher values of @xmath3 are better able to explain the observations_.    as the cno elements play such a key role in the interpretation of the cluster data , one must first consider whether their abundances , relative to iron , are higher in m@xmath267 than in the sun . an increase in the abundances of c , n , _ and _ o by @xmath55 dex ( or more , if the increase is limited to one or two of these elements ) may be enough to reconcile the predicted and observed cmds .",
    "however , while a true cosmic spread among solar metallicity disk stars with an amplitude of about @xmath56 dex in [ c / fe ] , [ n / fe ] , and [ o / fe ] can not be excluded ( see the recent surveys by @xcite and @xcite ) , the abundance analysis of m@xmath267 main - sequence stars carried out by @xcite does not support the possibility that m@xmath267 has [ cno / fe ] @xmath57 .",
    "these authors derived a mean oxygen abundance corresponding to [ o / fe ] @xmath58 , which agrees well with the findings of @xcite for cluster giants",
    ". the latter also derived c and n abundances , though , in the case of giant stars , they are expected to have been altered by cn burning and the first dredge - up .",
    "they find that [ c / h ] and [ n / h ] are typically @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively , which is roughly consistent with initial c and n abundances slightly _ lower _ than solar .",
    "in fact , @xcite found a mean [ c / h ] of @xmath61 for three f dwarfs of m@xmath267 .",
    "[ based on the work of @xcite , we find that the expected differential effects due to the use of 3-d model atmospheres in the determination of [ o / fe ] in the cluster turnoff stars , like those analyzed by randich et al . , would amount to @xmath62 dex relative to the solar value .",
    "] thus , it seems improbable that the cno abundances relative to iron are enhanced in the cluster with respect to the sun by as much as @xmath56 dex .",
    "we also note that an increase of the ne abundance , which has been suggested ( by @xcite ) to solve the discrepancy between solar oscillation data and the asplund et al .",
    "abundances would not resolve the m@xmath267 conundrum .",
    "although our present understanding of diffusive processes precludes the possibility that there is a large difference between the interior and photospheric metallicities of the sun , @xcite have found from their calculations for @xmath63 that the lowest mass diffusive model with a convective core on the ms is @xmath64 , as opposed to @xmath65 in the case of non - diffusive models . the difference in mass is comparable to the difference in @xmath13 predicted by our calculations when the assumed value of @xmath0 is increased from 0.0125 ( asplund et al . ) to 0.0165 ( gs98 ) .",
    "consequently , it seems quite possible that low-@xmath0 _ diffusive _ models ( with or without some core overshooting ) may be able to satisfy the m@xmath267 constraint .",
    "further investigation is needed . however , even if this leads to a consistent explanation for both the asplund et al .",
    "solar abundances and the m@xmath267 cmd , the large discrepancies with helioseismology would remain .",
    "the new asplund et al .",
    "metallicity for the sun presents some difficulties for fits of solar abundance models to the m@xmath267 cmd , in that they do not predict a gap near the turnoff where one is observed . whether or not stellar models predict",
    "a gap at the observed @xmath46 in this open cluster depends quite sensitively on the assumed cno abundances , and it is mainly the revision of these elemental abundances ( along with that of ne ) that is responsible for the decrease in @xmath3 from 0.0165 ( gs98 ) to 0.0125 .",
    "isochrones for the higher value of @xmath0 are able to reproduce the detailed cmd morphology of m@xmath267 in the vicinity of the turnoff without apparent problems .",
    "interestingly , it is primarily the reduction in the abundances of cno that has resulted in substantial difficulties for helioseismology ; e.g. , an increase from @xmath66% to @xmath10% in the differences between the predicted and inferred sound speed squared profiles .",
    "are solar oscillation studies and our investigation of m@xmath267 telling us that the low solar @xmath0 determined by asplund et al .",
    "is wrong ?    not necessarily .",
    "it is possible , judging from the work of @xcite , that models which take diffusive processes into account may not have the same difficulties as the models used in this study , which neglect such processes .",
    "that is , if the asplund et al .",
    "solar abundances are correct , _ only _ those low-@xmath0 models that treat diffusion may be able to reproduce the m@xmath267 cmd .",
    "this possibility , which would _ not _ resolve the quandary presented by solar oscillations , needs to be carefully studied .",
    "diffusion clearly adds another level of complexity to the problem since , e.g. , the initial abundances of the gas out of which the sun and m@xmath267 formed would have been somewhat different , if they have the same abundances today , because the sun is up to 1 gyr older than m@xmath267 .",
    "importantly , ms stars in m@xmath267 should show systematic variations in their surface metallicities as a function of @xmath52 due to the operation of diffusive processes ( see michaud et al . ) .",
