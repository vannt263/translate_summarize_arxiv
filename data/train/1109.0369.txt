    "the nonthermal spectral index @xmath3 , is the main parameter of interest because it is used to model cre generation and propagation .",
    "however , it is not possible to measure it directly .",
    "the quantity which is measured is the total spectral index @xmath4 which is contaminated by thermal free - free emission .",
    "this contamination is significant for spatially resolved regions of the galaxy where the thermal fraction , where , @xmath5 is the flux density of the thermal emission . in the text",
    "we express @xmath6 as percentages . ]",
    "( henceforth , @xmath6 ) is high . in this section",
    ", we assess the effect of @xmath6 on @xmath3 obtained between 333 mhz and near 1.4 ghz in spatially resolved regions of the galaxy . to do this",
    ", we use the method of thermal - nonthermal separation developed by @xcite and apply it to five of our galaxies ( except ngc 3034 ) .",
    "the method uses dust extinction corrected h@xmath4 maps to get a template for the free - free emission across the galaxy , and extrapolates it to the desired radio frequency to obtain spatially resolved thermal radio emission maps .",
    "the extinction correction is achieved by estimating the dust temperature and optical depth using the far infra - red maps at @xmath770@xmath8 m and @xmath7160@xmath8 m ( see appendix  [ appendixa1 ] for details ) .",
    "the far infrared @xmath7160@xmath8 m map has an angular resolution of @xmath9 , and hence the final nonthermal spectral index maps have this angular resolution , which is significantly coarser than the total spectral index ( hereafter @xmath4 ) maps .",
    "the usefulness of this method lies in the fact that it can be used in spatially resolved parts of the galaxy .",
    "further , @xcite demonstrate the robustness of their method over several other existing thermal - nonthermal separation techniques ( see references therein and @xcite ) .",
    "the mean @xmath6 for all our sample galaxies was found to be less than 5% at 333 mhz , although the value can go up to 10% in some specific bright regions and in the spiral arms . applying the same method to the available higher frequency data at or close to 1.4 ghz",
    ", we found the mean @xmath6 to be less than 12% .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath6 at 333 mhz and near 1.4 ghz for five galaxies is shown in figure  [ figurea1 ] of the appendix .    the nonthermal 333 mhz and higher frequency maps",
    "were further used to obtain @xmath3 variation for the five galaxies .",
    "the left panels of figure  [ figure3 ] , show the @xmath4 maps and the right panels show the @xmath3 maps .",
    "figure  [ figure4 ] shows the variation of @xmath4 and @xmath3 with radius for the galaxies . here ,",
    "the spectral index was estimated by azimuthally averaging over annuli of one beam width .",
    "the radial profiles clearly reveal that the nonthermal spectral index is nominally steeper than the uncorrected values , and further steepens towards the outer parts of the galaxy .",
    "however , we note that towards the outer parts of the galaxies , the steepening of both the total and nonthermal spectral indices may be caused due to `` missing flux density '' problems .     as a function of @xmath6 at 1465 mhz for ngc 6946 obtained at spatially resolved regions of the galaxy .",
    "the black circles corresponds to @xmath10 between 333 mhz and 1465 mhz , while the red triangles shows between 1465 mhz and 4860 mhz .",
    "the top panel shows the flux density normalized to the peak value at 333 mhz ( in black ) and 1465 mhz ( in red ) respectively .",
    "note that generally higher flux density regions have high thermal fractions.,width=302,height=302 ]    [ figure5 ]    we are now in a position to quantify the importance of thermal - nonthermal separation , for robust estimates of @xmath3 between 333 mhz and near 1 ghz .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath3 can be estimated by propagating the various sources of errors in obtaining the nonthermal maps .",
    "three primary sources of error affect the @xmath3 measurement , namely : the rms in the two radio maps ( @xmath11 ) , the error associated with the uncalibrated system temperature of the instrument @xmath12 , and the error in thermal fraction , @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath12 is about 5% at 333 mhz for the gmrt and assumed about 2% for vla and wsrt near or at 1.4 ghz maps .",
    "the error @xmath13 is estimated to be about 10% at these frequencies by @xcite ( also see appendix a ) . incorporating these errors , we have computed the ratio @xmath14 in regions by dividing the galaxy into rectangular grids of size of approximately 40@xmath15 .",
    "we find that for thermal fraction less that 5% at 333 mhz and less than about 10% near 1.4 ghz , @xmath16 .",
    "this effect is illustrated for ngc 6946 in the bottom panel of figure  6 , where the @xmath14 is plotted ( in black ) as a function of thermal fraction near 1.4 ghz . within",
    "the error bars the ratio is consistent with unity for thermal fraction less than 10% . for higher thermal fraction ( predominantly in the arms or regions",
    ") the ratio drops below unity , and correction to @xmath4 , to obtain @xmath3 , could be as high as 20% .",
    "the thermal - nonthermal separation is even more important for @xmath3 calculated between higher frequency pairs like 1.4 ghz and 4.8 ghz .",
    "the ratio @xmath14 for ngc 6946 obtained between 1465 mhz and 4860 mhz ( using archival map downloaded from ned , @xcite ) is plotted in red in figure  6 , where we clearly see that the ratio is significantly below unity for the whole range of thermal fractions . note that since there is also a systematic uncertainty associated with the absolute calibration scale for calibrating radio flux densities , the absolute value of the spectral index can vary by about 10% .",
    "* ngc 1097 : * our 333 mhz map ( see figure  [ figure1 ] ) has an angular resolution of 16@xmath1711@xmath15 , which corresponds to a spatial resolution of @xmath2 1.1 kpc , if the galaxy is at a distance of 14 mpc .",
    "the only other low frequency radio continuum study of this galaxy was done by @xcite and @xcite at 1465 mhz .",
    "they reported strong radio emission coincident with the narrow dust lanes in the bar .",
    "the central bar region is also clearly visible in our 333 mhz map , and is coincident with dust emission inferred from the far infra - red @xmath724@xmath8 m images from _ spitzer _ , as seen in figure 7 .",
    "the bar pattern rotates in the clockwise direction ( see @xcite ) , and as expected prominent shock fronts are visible on the leading side of the bar with respect to the sense of rotation .",
    "the @xmath6 in the bar region at 333 mhz is estimated to be @xmath181% , hence the radio emission at this frequency is entirely nonthermal in origin .",
    "these observations fit well with the explanation that the radio emission from the bar results due to shock compression of gas , dust and magnetic field , as was concluded by @xcite .",
    "the total emission from the bar and the central component ( the region shown in figure 7 ) is 835@xmath1957 mjy , out of which 750@xmath1952 mjy arises from the central compact region ( 25@xmath1721@xmath15 ) . for a similar sized central region @xcite quote a flux density of 260 mjy at 1465 mhz , based",

    ", the bar region continues into two prominent arms however the radio emission is highly diffuse .",
    "we find the thermal fraction of the interarm region at 333 mhz and 1465 mhz to be 0.2% and 2.5% respectively whereas in the spiral arm regions it is 1% and 4.5% respectively . in the arm regions ,",

    "we find the integrated flux density at 333 mhz to be 14 jy which is consistent with flux densities measured at other frequencies .",
    "the rms of the image , which is 3 mjy / beam , is dynamic range limited since the peak flux density in the galaxy is 3 jy / beam .",
    "morphologically the galaxy is featureless at our resolution , although the northern extension ( @xmath39 ) is coincident with the base of the h@xmath4/optical horn ( see figure  [ figure1 ] ) , which is likely due to synchrotron emitting particles convected outwards by the nuclear wind , tracing the h@xmath4 horns .",
    "the galaxy was observed between 330 mhz to 4835 mhz by @xcite , and a similar horn was seen at @xmath21515 mhz .",

    "if the energy losses are due to ionization , @xmath3 flattens @xcite .",
    "synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering loss leads to a steepening of the spectra , while adiabatic cooling and bremsstrahlung keep the spectra unchanged . to assess the behaviour of @xmath3 in spatially resolved parts of the galaxy we plot @xmath3 distribution ( as shown in figure  [ figure9 ] ) for two regimes of thermal fraction : @xmath109 ( filled grey histogram ) and @xmath110 ( unfilled histogram ) ,",

    "the steepening in the range @xmath116 arises from the interarm regions , and indicates energy losses through synchrotron emission and inverse compton scattering .",
    "@xmath117 , is mostly from low flux density regions , primarily in the outer parts of the galaxies , and may be affected due to missing flux density in the higher radio frequency maps .",
    "note that we have averaged in a region 40@xmath15 , which for all these galaxies corresponds to @xmath2 1 kpc to 3 kpc , and hence the flatter part of @xmath3 distribution may be affected due to bright regions .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the absolute value of @xmath3 can change by @xmath210% due to uncertainty in flux scale at 333 mhz . a recent study by @xcite for ngc 628 ,",
