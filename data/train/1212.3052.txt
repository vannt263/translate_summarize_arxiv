    "when a sediment bed is exposed to a fluid flow , particles can be entrained and transported by different mechanisms .",
    "the transport regime depends primarily on the inertial characteristics of the particles and the fluid .",
    "sufficiently light particles are transported as suspended load in which their weight is supported by the turbulence of the fluid .",
    "in contrast , particles which are sufficiently heavy are transported along the surface @xcite .",
    "this type of transport incorporates two main transport modes , namely : _",
    "saltation _ ,",
    "which consists of sediment grains jumping downstream close to the ground at nearly ballistic trajectories , and _ creep _ , which consists of particles rolling and sliding along the sediment bed .",
    "sediment transport along the surface is responsible for a wide range of geophysical phenomena , including surface erosion , dust aerosol emission , and the formation and migration of dunes @xcite .",
    "therefore , the quantitative understanding of sediment transport may improve our understanding of river beds evolution @xcite , the emission of atmospheric dust @xcite and the dynamics of planetary sand landscapes @xcite .",
    "once sediment transport begins , the fluid loses momentum to accelerate the particles as a consequence of newton s second law ( the transport - flow feedback , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the sediment flux , @xmath0 , which is the average momentum of grains transported per unit soil area , is limited by an equilibrium value , the saturated flux , @xmath1 .",
    "although previous studies focused on this equilibrium flux ( e.g. @xcite ) , the dynamics of sediment landscapes is controlled by situations _ out - of - equilibrium_. in particular , the sediment flux needs a spatial lag  the so - called saturation length , @xmath2  to adapt to a change in flow conditions @xcite .",
    "this saturation length introduces the main relevant length - scale in the dynamics of sediment landscapes under water and on the surface of planetary bodies .",
    "for instance , the saturation length controls the minimal size of crescent - shaped ( barchan ) dunes moving on top of bedrock , as well as the wavelength of the smallest dunes ( the so - called `` elementary dunes '' ) emerging on top of a sediment bed @xcite .",
    "although important insights were gained recently from experimental studies @xcite , the physics behind the saturation length , and thus the dependence of @xmath2 on flow and sediment attributes , is still insufficiently understood .",
    "one of the most important deficiencies in our understanding of the dependence of @xmath2 on flow and sediment conditions is that it remains uncertain which mechanisms are most important in determining the saturation of the sediment mass flux . on the one hand",
    ", it has been suggested that the acceleration of transported particles due to fluid drag is the dominant relaxation mechanism @xcite .",
    "this model neglects the entrainment of sediment bed particles due to fluid lift , as well as the entrainment of sediment bed particles and the deceleration of transported particles due to collisions of transported particles with the sediment bed ( grain - bed collisions ) . on the other hand , the entrainment of sediment bed particles by fluid",
    "lift and grain - bed collisions has also been proposed to be the dominant relaxation mechanisms @xcite",
    ". however , these models neglect momentum changes of transported particles , which is exactly the opposite situation of the models in refs .  @xcite .",
    "moreover , to our knowledge , all previous models neglected a further relaxation mechanism of the sediment flux , namely , the relaxation of the fluid speed in the transport layer ( @xmath3 ) due to the saturation of the transport - flow feedback @xcite .    to address this situation and develop an accurate expression for @xmath2 that can be used in future studies",
    ", this paper presents a model for flux saturation in sediment transport which , for the first time , accounts for _ all _ aforementioned mechanisms for the saturation of sediment flux .",
    "in particular , our theoretical model accounts for the coupling between the entrainment of sediment bed particles due to fluid lift and grain - bed collisions , the acceleration and deceleration of transported particles due to fluid forces and grain - bed collisions , and the saturation of @xmath3 due to the saturation of the transport - flow feedback . our analytical model allows us to derive a closed expression for @xmath2 which can be applied to different physical environments .",
    "our model suggests that grain - bed collisions , which have been neglected in all previous studies , have an important influence on the saturation length , @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , our model suggests that the relaxation of @xmath3 plays an important role for sediment transport in dilute fluids ( aeolian transport ) , whereas it plays a negligible role for sediment transport in dense fluids ( subaqueous transport ) .    in a recent letter ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we presented our equation for @xmath2 and showed that it is consistent with measurements of @xmath2 in both subaqueous and aeolian sediment transport regimes over at least five orders of magnitude in the ratio between fluid and particle density .",
    "in the present paper , we derive the analytical model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite in more detail and study the properties of the equations governing the behavior of the saturation length in both transport regimes . since ref .",
    "@xcite includes a detailed comparison of our model against measurements , no model comparisons against measurements are included here .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "sections [ derivation ] and [ obtaining_ls ] discuss the analytical treatment of flux saturation . in the former section , we derive the mass and momentum conservation equations for the layer of sediments in transport , as well as the differential equation of the sediment flux in terms of the mass density and average velocity of the transported particles .",
    "these equations allow us to obtain a mathematical expression for the saturation length of sediment transport , which is presented in section [ obtaining_ls ] .",
    "this section also discusses how to determine the quantities appearing in the saturation length equation , which encode the attributes of sediment and flow , as well as the characteristics of sediment entrainment and particle - fluid interactions . in section [ discussion ]",
    "we use our theoretical expression to perform a study of the saturation length as a function of the relevant physical quantities controlling saturation of sediment flux .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the downstream evolution of the sediment flux , @xmath0 , towards its equilibrium value , @xmath1 , can be described by the following equation @xcite , which is identical to eq .",
    "( 1 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath4 which is valid in the regime where @xmath0 is close to saturation ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the length - scale @xmath2 , the saturation length , characterizes the response of the sediment flux due to a small change in flow conditions around equilibrium . since @xmath6",
    ", @xmath2 can be written as the negative inverse first - order taylor coefficient of @xmath7 , @xmath8    in this section , we derive the equations that describe the downstream evolution of the sediment mass flux , @xmath0 , towards its equilibrium value , @xmath9 , in sediment transport under turbulent boundary layer flow .",
    "the mass flux @xmath0 is defined as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the average transported mass per unit soil area and @xmath12 is the average particle velocity .",
    "therefore , the saturation of @xmath0 is dictated by the mechanisms governing the relaxation of @xmath11 and @xmath12 towards their saturated values , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the quantitative description of the saturation processes of @xmath11 and @xmath12 requires incorporation of all relevant forces acting on the sediment particles in transport , namely drag , gravity , buoyancy , collision forces between particles in transport ( `` mid - fluid collisions '' ) and friction due to collisions between particles and the bed . indeed , moraga et al .",
    "@xcite found experimentally that lift forces due to shear flow acting on a particle surrounded by fluid  which have often been assumed to be significant during transport ( e.g. @xcite )  are approximately an order of magnitude smaller than the drag force and can be , thus , neglected in our calculations . on the other hand ,",
    "the so - called added mass force exerted by accelerated or decelerated particles to dislodge the fluid as they move through it leads to enhanced inertia of the particles in transport .",
    "this added mass effect plays a relevant role for the motion of the particles @xcite , and thus we also take it into account .",
    "our analytical treatment applies to situations where the fluid velocity is not too high such that only transport through saltation or creep ( the main transport modes of particles along the surface @xcite ) is considered .",
    "transport through suspension or dense transport regimes , such as sheet flow @xcite , are , thus , not considered .    in section [ definitions ]",
    "we first present the definitions and notations used in our study . afterwards in section [ mass_and_momentum ] , we present the local conservation equations , from which we obtain the saturation equations , presented in section [ sec : saturation ] .",
    "we use a three - dimensional coordinate system @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the direction of fluid motion , @xmath17 is the lateral direction and @xmath18 is the vertical direction .",
    "the top of the sediment bed , which corresponds to the height at which the local particle concentration equals approximately @xmath19 of the particle concentration deep within the bed @xcite , is located at the vertical position @xmath20 .",
    "here we use the approximation that the slopes of bedforms are usually very small ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "moreover , since the time - scale of the relaxation of the sediment flux due to changes in the flow is typically much smaller than the time - scale of the evolution of bedforms ( dunes and ripples ) @xcite ( @xmath22 ) , we can adopt the approximation that the transport over the sediment landscape is in the steady - state , i.e. @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes time .",
    "furthermore , since our description relates to the saturation of the mass flux @xmath0 due to changes in the downstream direction , we consider a laterally invariant sediment bed ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we consider a certain microscopic configuration of @xmath26 particles ( including the limit @xmath27 ) labeled by an upper index @xmath28 whose centers of mass are located at @xmath29 .",
    "each particle has a mass @xmath30 , a velocity @xmath31 , and is subjected to a force @xmath32 resulting in an acceleration @xmath33 .",
    "these forces include both external body forces ( @xmath34 ) and interparticle contact forces . in general these forces",
    "are non - conservative .",
    "the interparticle contact forces occur for all pairs of contacting particles . we therefore denote them by @xmath35 , which is the contact force applied by the particle with the number @xmath28 on the particle with the number @xmath36 .",
    "we note that @xmath37 if these particles are not in contact , and we define @xmath38 ( no self - interaction ) .",
    "hence , the total acceleration of particle @xmath28 can be written as , @xmath39    we define @xmath40 , the density of a certain microscopic configuration of particles at time @xmath24 , as @xmath41 it describes the number of particles , @xmath42 , with positions , velocities , and masses in infinitesimal intervals around @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath36 , respectively , at time @xmath24 , @xmath45 moreover , @xmath46 determines the mass density , @xmath47 while the mass - weighted average of a quantity @xmath48 is defined through the equation , @xmath49 in eqs .",

    "the derivation of these conservation equations can be found in babic @xcite .",
    "for our system ( @xmath54 ) , these equations are , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is given by @xcite , @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath56 is the contact force contribution to the particle stress tensor since its gradient compensates the contact force density @xcite , @xmath59 it describes the momentum flux due to collisions between particles .",
    "in fact , even though the total momentum is conserved in collisions , the finite size of the particles and thus @xmath60 lead to a shift of the location of this momentum .",
    "we note that this shift of the momentum location in collisions has been neglected in our model derivation in ref .",
    "@xcite ( dilute approximation ) . as a consequence , eq .",
    "( [ mombx ] ) is a generalization of eq .",
    "( 2 ) of ref .  @xcite , such that these two equations are equal if the contributions from @xmath56 in eq .",

    "the distribution @xmath61 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ pij ] ) is the mathematical expression for a  delta line  between @xmath62 and @xmath29 .",
    "integrating this distribution over an arbitrary domain yields the fraction of the line contained in this domain .",
    "the inhomogeneities introduced by this and the other delta distributions indirectly appearing in quantities of the type @xmath63 are smoothed out by the time averaging procedure @xmath50 , which is also incorporated in the definition of @xmath64 .",
    "the results of the last section can be now used in order to derive the saturation equations for the average transported mass per unit soil area ( @xmath11 ) and the average particle velocity ( @xmath12 ) , used to define the sediment flux , @xmath65 . to do so",
    ", we first integrate eqs .",

    "this calculation is the subject of section [ height_integration ] .",
    "thereafter , in section [ momentum_balance ] , we combine the resulting horizontal and vertical momentum balances by means of a coulomb friction law and rewrite each term of the horizontal momentum balance equation in terms of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we then present the mass and horizontal momentum balance equations in their final form in section [ final_form ] .",
    "since our description relates to the saturation of the mass flux @xmath0 due to changes in the downstream direction ( @xmath16 ) , we integrate eqs .",

    "in other words , these two terms describe the total amounts of horizontal and vertical momentum , respectively , per unit soil area that enter the transport layer per unit time from the sediment bed .",
    "these momentum changes per unit area and time of the transport layer can be seen as being caused by an effective force per unit area ( @xmath73 ) which the sediment bed applies on the transport layer ,",
    "@xmath74 bagnold @xcite was the first who proposed that these force components are related to each other through a coulomb friction law , independent of whether the transport regime is subaqueous or aeolian .",
    "that is , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the coulomb friction coefficient .",
    "models for saturated sediment transport using this coulomb friction law have been successfully validated through comparison with experiments , thus giving support to the coulomb friction law adapted to sediment transport ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "additional support comes from numerical simulations of saturated ( @xmath77 ) granular couette flows under gravity .",
    "zhang and campbell @xcite found for such flows that the interface between the particle bed and the transport layer is characterized by a constant ratio between the @xmath78 and @xmath79 components of the particle stress tensor ( @xmath80 ) , @xmath81 .",
    "since both couette flow and sediment transport along the surface are granular shear flows , it seems reasonable that also the interface between the sediment bed and the transport layer for saturated sediment transport along the surface is characterized by such a law .",
    "indeed , @xmath82 and @xmath83 become equal to @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively , if @xmath86 @xcite , which is fulfilled for saturated sediment transport since @xmath77 implies @xmath87 ( cf .",
    "( [ massb ] ) ) , which in turn implies @xmath86 due to @xmath88 vanishing sufficiently deep within the sediment bed .",
    "finally , it seems reasonable that the coulomb friction law should be also approximately valid in situations weakly out - of - equilibrium @xcite , provided the sediment flux is close to its saturated value . assuming the validity of eq .",

    " since we are only interested in situations close to equilibrium , and since at equilibrium @xmath86 ( see discussion in the previous paragraph ) , it follows @xmath92 ( @xmath76 is of order unity ) .",
    "moreover , for sufficiently dilute granular flows , the momentum transfer in collisions is small and thus @xmath93 . while sediment transport in the aeolian regime is certainly dilute enough to ensure this condition for most of the transport layer , sediment transport in the subaqueous regime",
    "might not fulfill it because a large part of the transport occurs in rather dense regions of the transport layer @xcite .",
    "however , using the code of durn et al .",
    "@xcite , we confirmed that @xmath93 also for subaqueous transport .",
    "hence , @xmath90 can be approximated as , @xmath94 we confirmed , using the code of durn et al .",
    "@xcite , that for transport in equilibrium ( @xmath77 ) @xmath90 is nearly constant with the fluid shear velocity , @xmath95 , in both sediment transport regimes .",
    "hence , it seems reasonable that changes of @xmath90 with @xmath16 during the saturation process of the sediment flux close to equilibrium can be regarded as negligible compared to the corresponding changes of @xmath11 or @xmath12 with @xmath16 . in this manner",
    ", we can consider the value of @xmath90 associated with sediment transport in equilibrium , independent of the downstream position and of the fluid shear velocity .",
    "this leads to the following approximation for @xmath90 , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the equilibrium value of @xmath98 .",
    "this equilibrium value of @xmath90 can be determined from experiments as we will discuss in section [ cv_aeolian ] and [ cv_subaqueous ] .",
    "now we express both terms on the right - hand - side of the momentum conservation equation , i.e. eq .  ( [ mombalance3x ] ) , as functions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 in order to obtain a differential equation describing the saturation of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    the first term on the right - hand - side of eq .",

    "( [ ca ] ) , this `` added mass '' of the fluid layer amounts to approximately one half the weight of the fluid displaced by the particle @xcite . while the added mass correction is significant for transport in a dense medium such as water @xcite , it is negligibly small for sediment transport in the aeolian regime since @xmath108 for large @xmath109 .",

    "this average drag force in turn is proportional to both the mass density @xmath11 of transported particles and to the acceleration term @xmath329 . recalling that @xmath194 in the aeolian regime , we have that , close to saturation , both @xmath11 and @xmath12 are smaller ( if @xmath330 ) or larger ( if @xmath331 ) than their respective saturated values , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "hence , if @xmath332 ( @xmath333 ) , it follows that @xmath334 ( @xmath335 ) , which means that the mass density and the acceleration term deviate from their saturated values in opposite directions .",
    "the average drag force applied by the fluid onto the transport layer ( @xmath328 ) thus can be both larger ( under mars conditions for sufficiently small @xmath305 ) or smaller ( under both terrestrial and martian conditions for sufficiently large @xmath305 ) than its saturated value .",

( [ diffmarsearth2 ] ) ) , @xmath339 and thus the saturation length @xmath2 increases in comparison to @xmath179 .",
    "the deviation of @xmath175 from @xmath179 becomes stronger with increasing @xmath305 because the effect of the sediment transport on the fluid velocity increases with @xmath305 .",

    "the dependence of @xmath304 on @xmath273 is controlled by two main factors : the dependence of the drag coefficient and of the shields parameter on the particle reynolds number ( @xmath324 ) , and the dependence of the saturation of the sediment flux on the transport - flow feedback .",

    "the same qualitative behavior of @xmath304 with @xmath273 observed in the subaqueous regime occurs for aeolian sediment transport on earth at shear velocities close to the threshold , as can be seen in fig .",
    "two main factors dictate the observed dependence of @xmath304 on @xmath273 for aeolian transport under terrestrial conditions .",
    "first , close to the threshold , the fluid velocity is almost undisturbed by the particle transport , since only a few particles are transported .",
    "hence , the feedback term @xmath175 associated with the aeolian regime of transport under terrestrial conditions when @xmath95 is close to threshold for sustained transport , @xmath325 , is close to unity , as it is in the subaqueous regime .",
    "second , @xmath345 , @xmath323 and @xmath143 behave qualitatively in the same manner with @xmath273 as they do in the subaqueous regime .",
    "therefore , also @xmath304 for aeolian transport under terrestrial conditions with @xmath95 close to @xmath325 depends on @xmath273 in the same manner as it does in the subaqueous regime .",
    "in contrast , for large shear velocities , the qualitative behavior of @xmath304 with @xmath273 observed for aeolian sediment transport on earth is qualitatively different from the one observed in the subaqueous regime ( see figs .",
    "[ ls_d]b@xmath343c ) .",
    "this is because the saturation of the transport - flow feedback for aeolian sediment transport plays a relevant role for large @xmath95 .",
    "in this regime , the approximation @xmath182 is not valid anymore , instead the feedback term @xmath175 follows eq .",
    "( [ kasym ] ) . consequently",
    ", @xmath2 is proportional to @xmath347 and not to @xmath344 .",
    "since @xmath323 decreases with @xmath273 before it reaches an approximately constant value , so does @xmath304 as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ ls_d]b@xmath343c .",
    "_ aeolian regime under martian conditions _  for aeolian transport under martian conditions , @xmath304 shows a qualitative behavior with @xmath273 that is different from the one of aeolian transport under terrestrial conditions .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is a different qualitative behavior of the normalized average particle velocity @xmath323 , as we explain in the following . in aeolian sediment transport ,",
    "the average velocity of particles impacting and leaving the sediment bed ( @xmath348 ) is nearly independent of properties of the fluid @xcite .",
    "rather , @xmath348 is largely controlled by the characteristics of the sediment bed , for instance by cohesive interparticle forces .",
    "these forces increase in importance with decreasing particle size @xcite .",
    "due to these forces , @xmath349 increases with decreasing @xmath273 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_t ] ) ) . at the same time , as already mentioned , @xmath345 increases with @xmath273 . both @xmath350 and @xmath345 control the normalized average particle velocity @xmath323 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ vsaeolian ] ) and ( [ eq : v_t ] ) ) .    the qualitative difference between aeolian sediment transport on earth and mars",
    "is due to @xmath351 being approximately @xmath352 times larger on earth than on mars .",
    "this difference in the scaling of @xmath351 implies that the decreasing trend of @xmath350 with @xmath273 has a smaller effect on the saturation length for martian conditions than it does for @xmath2 under terrestrial conditions .",
    "indeed , while the value of @xmath323 of aeolian transport under terrestrial conditions decreases with @xmath273 ( due to the decrease of @xmath350 with @xmath273 ) , the martian value of @xmath323 _ increases _ with @xmath273 .",
    "this behavior , which is opposite to the one of terrestrial transport , is due to the increase of @xmath345 with @xmath273  except for small particle diameters for which @xmath345 becomes much smaller than @xmath350 .    the complex behavior of the saturation length @xmath2 plotted in figs .",
    "[ ls_u ] and [ ls_d ] suggests that both the entrainment of sediment bed particles by fluid lift and grain - bed collisions , and the momentum change of saltating particles due to drag and grain - bed collisions have a considerable influence on the saturation of the sediment flux .",
    "thus , these relaxation mechanisms of the sediment flux probably can not be neglected as done in previous studies @xcite .",
    "moreover , the relaxation of @xmath3 , which has also been neglected in previous studies , seems to play a significant role in the saturation length of aeolian sediment transport , for which the feedback term @xmath175 ( eq .  [ lsfluid ] ) does not vanish since @xmath353 .",
    "in fact , for sufficiently large @xmath220 , the feedback term @xmath175 follows eq .",
    "( [ kasym ] ) , which means that @xmath2 scales with @xmath347 instead of scaling with @xmath344 for small @xmath220 .",
    "hence , our study suggests that the saturation of @xmath3 can not be neglected for aeolian sediment transport .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a model for flux saturation in sediment transport which , for the first time , accounts for both relevant relaxation processes of sediment flux identified in previous works  namely , the saturation of the mass density of transported particles and the relaxation of particle velocities  as well as for the different types of sediment entrainment prevailing under different environmental conditions .",
    "furthermore , our model accounts for the saturation transient of the fluid velocity within the transport layer , which is associated with the saturation of the transport - flow feedback inherent to the interaction between the fluid and the particles in transport .",
    "the main outcome of our analytical treatment is a closed - expression for the saturation length of sediment transport , @xmath2 ( eq .",
    "( [ lvfinal2 ] ) ) , which can be used to calculate @xmath2 under different environmental conditions corresponding to both subaqueous and aeolian regimes of sediment transport .",
    "in particular , @xmath2 predicted from our equation is a complex function of the grain diameter , @xmath273 , and of the fluid shear velocity , @xmath95 .",
    "this behavior is in contrast with the scaling of @xmath2 with @xmath354 @xcite , which was obtained from a simplified model that considers only the relaxation of particle velocity and thus neglects the dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath95 observed in experiments @xcite .    while the purpose of the present work was to introduce our theoretical model for flux saturation and to present the analytical derivation of our universal equation for the saturation length , in a separate work @xcite",
    "we show that this equation consistently predicts the saturation length in different physical environments .",
    "indeed , our saturation length equation is in good quantitative agreement with direct measurements of @xmath2 in a wind tunnel , as well as with indirect estimates of @xmath2 from the size of subaqueous ripples and dunes on earth , mars and venus .    in future studies ,",
    "our equation can be used to predict the scale of dunes under different extraterrestrial environments @xcite or to infer attributes of sediment and flow in planetary dune fields from the minimal size of barchan dunes or from the wavelength of `` elementary '' dunes emerging on dense sand beds . moreover",
    ", our equation can be used to calculate the saturation length in the morphodynamic dune model of ref .",
    "@xcite , which couples a continuum model for sediment transport with an analytical model for the average turbulent fluid shear stress over mildly - sloped topographies @xcite .",
    "our equation can further improve morphodynamic models in hydraulic engineering applications in which the saturation length is usually treated as an adjustable parameter @xcite .",
    "the importance of the saturation length for such models has been debated among engineers @xcite , and it was concluded that even at fluvial scale the influence of sediment transport saturation was significant @xcite . we thus anticipate that the present work can provide substantial contributions to several areas of the geological , planetary and engineering sciences .",
