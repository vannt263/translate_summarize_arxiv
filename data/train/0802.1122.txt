    "numerous observations indicate that galaxies and clusters of galaxies have gravitational fields that are stronger at large radii than the standard theory of gravity predicts from the conjecture that light is a fair tracer of mass .",
    "the standard interpretation of this phenomenon is that @xmath0 of the mass in the universe is contributed by particles that are dark because they do not interact electromagnetically .",
    "the alternative hypothesis , that the standard theory of gravity fails at low accelerations , was advanced by @xcite .",
    "subsequently @xcite proposed a modification of poisson s equation that put the proposal on a quantitative basis .",
    "recently interest in modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) has increased with a growing awareness that relativistically covariant theories are possible that reduce in the non - relativistic limit to the bekenstein - milgrom theory @xcite .",
    "one way to rule out mond would be to detect the particles that are supposed to contribute most of the universe s mass , and several experiments are endeavouring to do this under the assumption that the particles have weak interactions .",
    "another way to rule out mond would be to show that it is inconsistent with observations of the growth of cosmic structure ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or the dynamics and evolution of galaxies .    in standard gravity , dynamical friction ( df )",
    "is thought to play a major role in several astrophysical contexts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "ciotti & binney ( 2004 ; hereafter cb04 ) showed that df is a more potent phenomenon in mond than in standard gravity , and argued that it would cause the globular clusters of dwarf spheroidal galaxies to spiral to the centres of their hosts within a dynamical time .",
    "however , the results in cb04 were obtained under rather restrictive assumptions and by a non - standard argument that involves the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , cb04 gave results for plane - parallel systems that are in the `` deep - mond '' regime .",
    "given the prediction of cb04 that df is much more powerful in mond than in newtonian gravity , it is important to test their results with a different approach and in less specialized contexts .    in this paper",
    "we use n - body experiments to explore df in regimes in which departures from newtonian gravity are of varying magnitude .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we outline our methodology explain our choice of problem .",
    "section  3 gives details of the code and the initial conditions of the simulations .",
    "section 4 presents the results and section  5 relates them to other recent work .",
    "the conclusions and their astronomical implications are summarized in section  6 .",
    "two fundamental features of mond preclude a direct extension of the standard chandrasekhar  spitzer derivation of df @xcite : in mond ( i ) forces are not additive and ( ii ) all two - body orbits are bound , so individual encounters do not have a finite duration . on the other hand , there is no fundamental obstacle to direct simulations of df in mond : the drag experienced by a massive object as it moves through a swarm of less massive objects can be measured in an n - body simulation .    in the classical approach to df one imagines the background swarm to be homogeneous and perpetrates the jeans swindle to neglect the mean gravitational field of the swarm . even in newtonian gravity",
    "this step is of questionable validity , and it is inadmissible in mond because ( i ) the long - range nature of two - particle interactions in mond implies that distant encounters are liable to dominate ( in the newtonian case they nearly do ) and ( ii ) the non - linearity of the bekenstein ",
    "milgrom field equation implies that the impact of an encounter depends on the nature of the mean field .",
    "therefore , any attempt to extend to mond the classical approach to df leads to the consideration of the drag that a massive body experiences as it moves through a self - gravitating system of finite size .    in order to compare the action of df in mond and newtonian systems as cleanly as possible ,",
    "we compare df in mond with df in the _ equivalent newtonian system _ ( ens ) ; that is the newtonian system in which the visible matter has exactly the same phase - space distribution as in the mond system @xcite . in the ens",
    "the visible matter is enveloped in a dark - matter halo that contributes to the df experienced by a massive body .",
    "there are two astrophysically important problems for which df is crucial : ( i ) the inward spiralling of a small system that has fallen into a larger one ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ( ii ) the slowing of a massive bar by the material in which it is embedded ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "our mond - enabled n - body code ( n - mody ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is better adapted for problem ( ii ) because it uses a polar grid and therefore has higher resolution at small radii than at large .",
    "so we study the effect that mond has on the rate at which the rotation of a rigid bar is slowed by df .",
    "with @xcite we assume that poisson s equation @xmath1 should be replaced by the non - relativistic field equation @xmath2 = 4\\pi g \\rho , \\label{eqmond}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the standard euclidean norm , and @xmath4 is the gravitational potential for mond ; the gravitational acceleration is @xmath5 just as the newtonian acceleration is @xmath6 . for a system of finite mass , @xmath7 as @xmath8 .",
    "the function @xmath9 is constrained by the theory only to the extent that it must run smoothly from @xmath10 at @xmath11 ( the so - called deep - mond regime ) to @xmath12 at @xmath13 ( the newtonian regime ) , with the transition taking place at @xmath14 , i.e. , when @xmath15 is of order the characteristic acceleration @xmath16 . in the present work",
    "we adopt @xmath17 @xcite .    from poisson s equation and equation  ( [ eqmond ] )",
    "it follows that the mond and newtonian gravitational accelerations are related by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is a solenoidal field dependent on the specific @xmath21 considered . since in general @xmath22 , standard poisson solvers can not be used to develop mond n - body codes ; equation  ( [ eqmond ] ) must be solved at each time step ( brada & milgrom 1999 , nipoti et al .",
    "2007a ) .",
    "n - mody is a parallel , three - dimensional particle - mesh code that can be used to run either mond or newtonian simulations ( nipoti et al .",
    "2007a , * ? ? ?",
    "in the present study the spherical grid has 128 radial nodes , 64 nodes in colatitude @xmath23 and 128 nodes in azimuth @xmath4 , and the total number of particles is in the range @xmath24 .",
    "we verified with convergence experiments that these numbers of particles and grid points are sufficient to exclude that our results are significantly affected by discreteness effects .    in previous papers (",
    "* nipoti et al .",
    "2007ac ) we have used n - mody to demonstrate significant differences in the operation of violent relaxation in systems in which mond is important and in their newtonian equivalents .",
    "we refer readers to these papers and to @xcite for details of the code and its tests .",
    "the baryonic component of the initial conditions of the simulations is described by a spherical @xmath25-model @xcite with density distribution @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the total stellar mass , @xmath28 is the scale radius , @xmath25 is the inner logarithmic slope , and we consider the cases @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xcite . for a given model , the mond potential",
    "is easily calculated , and to each mond model with potential @xmath4 corresponds an ens with @xmath31 , thus having a _ total _",
    "density @xmath32 . in principle , such a distribution would have infinite mass , so we truncate it at @xmath33 .    the particles of the stellar component are distributed in phase - space with the standard rejection technique , restricting for simplicity to the fully isotropic case .",
    "the mond distribution function is obtained numerically with an eddington inversion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath34 where the upper integration limit reflects the far - field logarithmic behaviour of the mond potential .    in the equivalent newtonian models , at variance with nipoti et al .",
    "( 2007c ) , we do not distinguish between dark and stellar particles , but we consider a single component distributed according to the numerical isotropic distribution function @xmath35 note that the upper limit of integration is due to the finite mass of the system ( a consequence of the density truncation at @xmath36 ) .",
    "the physical scales of the problem are introduced as follows .",
    "first we identify each mond initial condition by fixing a value for the dimensionless internal acceleration parameter @xmath37 , so that @xmath27 and @xmath28 are not independent quantities : in physical units , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 . the time and velocity units are @xmath40 , and @xmath41 ( nipoti et al .",
    "the simulations are evolved up to @xmath42 ( where @xmath43 is the initial rotation period of the bar , see section  [ secbar ] ) , with timestep @xmath44 .",
    "we verified that both the mond system and its ens were in equilibrium by running them without the bar for several dynamical times .",
    "the dark and luminous matter distributions of the considered enss are shown in fig .",

    "all the considered enss are dark - matter dominated , because the corresponding mond cases have internal accelerations @xmath48 .",
    "focusing on the central regions of the enss , we note that , for fixed @xmath49 , models with cored stellar profile ( @xmath29 , dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ figmlratio ] ) have higher @xmath50 and shallower inner dark - matter profile than models with cuspy stellar profile ( @xmath30 , solid curves in fig .  [ figmlratio ] ) .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath51 when @xmath52 and @xmath53 when @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the inner logarithmic slope of the dark - matter density distribution .",
    "the density distribution of the rigid bar is a prolate ellipsoid of density distribution @xmath56 where in the cartesian system co - rotating with the bar @xmath57 in all the cases here presented we use @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 : with this choice , the length of the bar s semi - major axis is @xmath28 .",
    "we adopted the distribution  ( [ eqrhob ] ) because the gaussian dependence on @xmath61 produces a bar well defined spatially , but at the same time it avoids a density discontinuity that could produce spurious behaviour in the potential solver at the bar s edge . in all the simulations the bar rotates around the @xmath62 axis .",
    "the lagrangian formulation can be used to derive the bar s equations of motion in an inertial cartesian frame @xmath63 such that @xmath64 : with @xmath65 the angle in the @xmath66 plane between the @xmath67 and @xmath68 axes , we have @xmath69 where @xmath70 and from equation  ( [ eqrhob ] ) @xmath71    in order to start the numerical simulations smoothly , we take the density of the bar to be the product of equation  ( [ eqrhob ] ) and the function @xmath72 where the growth time is @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the initial angular velocity of the bar s frame .    as a consequence , when the bar mass is very small , the underlying density distribution is only slightly affected by its gravitational field , and the integral at the r.h.s of equation  ( [ eqphib ] ) almost vanishes . of course , in the mond simulations , on the r.h.s . of equation  ( [ eqmond ] )",
    "we have @xmath76 .",
    "in all the presented cases we use @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the circular velocity at @xmath28 ( i.e. at the edge of the bar ) .",
    "for all the simulations , the inner logarithmic slope @xmath25 , the internal acceleration ratio @xmath49 , the total dark to luminous mass ratio @xmath79 , the initial angular velocity of the bar @xmath75 and the total number of particles @xmath80 are given in table  1 .",
    "cb04 found that the df timescales in a ( deep ) mond system ( @xmath81 ) , and in the _ equivalent _ newtonian system ( @xmath82 ) are related by @xmath83 where @xmath84 with @xmath85 the modulus of the mond field and @xmath86 the modulus of the newtonian field _",
    "generated by the baryonic distribution_. we recall again that the treatment of cb04 was carried out for a plane - parallel distribution of field particles . in the present case",
    "the situation is more complicate , as @xmath87 is not constant in the system .",
    "thus , for each pair of simulations with the same value of @xmath49 and @xmath25 ( and therefore with the same gravitational field ) we assume as fiducial value @xmath88 , i.e. we evaluate @xmath87 at the edge of the bar .",
    "models with lower values of the parameter @xmath49 are in deeper - mond regime , so @xmath87 increases for decreasing @xmath49 . in particular , we considered the cases @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , so all the models presented have internal accelerations @xmath48 .    for each simulation , fig .",
    "[ figtomega ] plots against time the angular frequency of the bar @xmath92 ; models with constant - density cores are on the left and those with cuspy cores are on the right .",
    "systems with smaller @xmath49 and therefore more mond / dark - matter dominated dynamics are lower down . in each panel",
    "the full curve shows the mond system , and the dotted line its newtonian equivalent . in every case",
    "the bar slows down more in the mond system than in its ens .",
    "the instantaneous df timescale is @xmath93 , but in practice this quantity fluctuates strongly , so is is not a useful measure of the df timescale .",
    "a more robust measure is the time @xmath94 for @xmath95 to reach 70% of its initial value , so @xmath96 .",
    "figure  [ figkratio ] is a plot against @xmath97 of the mond value of @xmath94 divided by @xmath94 of the ens .",
    "this ratio decreases with @xmath49 as predicted by cb04 , and in the deep - mond regime the rate of decrease with increasing @xmath97 is consistent with that predicted by cb04 ( shown by the full line ) .",
    "the vertical offset between the full line and the points could partly reflect the arbitrariness of our definition of @xmath94 and our assignment of values of @xmath87 to simulations .",
    "however , we verified that for any sensible definition of @xmath87 , the experimental ratio @xmath98 is always closer to unity than cb04 predicted .",
    "presumably this finding arises because we are considering spherical systems , while cb04 assumed plane - parallel symmetry .",
    "@xcite used n - body simulations similar , in some respect , to those reported here to compare the dynamics of galactic bars in mond and in equivalent newtonian systems .",
    "they found that df had a much _ smaller _ effect on bars in mond than in the newtonian cases .",
    "this finding is not in conflict with our opposed finding for this reason : whereas our bars contain only five percent of the galaxy s baryonic mass , in the tiret & combes simulations the bars contain the majority of the baryonic mass .",
    "consequently , there is significant background mass for the tiret & combes bars to interact with through df only when dark matter is present .",
    "by contrast our bars interact with a background that contains 95 percent of the baryonic mass , so df is effective .",
    "similar reasoning applies to the findings of nipoti et al .",
    "( 2007c ) and @xcite that merging timescales are much longer in mond than in newtonian gravity with dark matter : in the newtonian case there is an abundance of dark matter to absorb energy and angular momentum from the stellar systems , while in mond the energy and angular momentum has to be absorbed by the outer parts of the stellar systems themselves .",
    "consequently , in the newtonian case a lot of matter takes up a relatively small amount of energy per particle , and the concept of df is applicable , while in the case of mond a small amount of matter takes up a lot of energy per particle , and df is not an appropriate concept .",
    "the prolonged merging timescale in mond is a consequence of the need to completely transform the orbits of the stars that are absorbing the original orbital energy .",
    "our fully non - linear simulations of the mond dynamics of realistic stellar systems nicely confirm the analytical predictions of cb04 .",
    "in particular , the simulations confirm the predicted scaling of the df timescale with the parameter @xmath97 that measures the extent to which the actual acceleration exceeds that generated by the baryons alone in newtonian gravity . consequently , the astrophysical consequences listed in cb04 are confirmed .",
    "prominent among these was the implication of short df timescales for the existence of globular clusters in dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "even simple newtonian models of dwarf spheroidals and dwarf ellipticals predict that many observed globular clusters should spiral to the galaxy centres within a hubble time @xcite .",
    "therefore the existence of objects such as the fornax dwarf spheroidal , which has five globular clusters but no stellar nucleus that could be the remains of clusters that have spiralled inwards , is a challenge to both newtonian gravity and mond . in the context of the standard cold - dark - matter theory ,",
    "the survival of fornax s globular cluster against df is problematic because it can be explained only if the dark matter halo has an extended core , and not a central cusp as predicted by the theory @xcite . from the point of view of mond ,",
    "dwarf spheroidals are in the deep - mond regime ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the mond inspiralling time of their globular clusters is as short as the dynamical time .",
    "snchez - salcedo et al .",
    "( 2006 ) evaluated in detail the predictions of mond and newtonian gravity for the fate of the globular clusters of the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy , and from the results of cb04 concluded that fornax is much more problematic for mond than for dark matter models .",
    "this conclusion gains strength from our confirmation of the central result of cb04 .",
