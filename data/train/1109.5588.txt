    "cosmic rays ( crs ) with energies below the knee region ( @xmath1 ev ) are considered to be of galactic origin .",
    "although the exact nature of their sources are not known , the most favorable candidates are the supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "they are known to occur in our galaxy at the rate of @xmath2 yr@xmath3 with each explosion releasing a total kinetic energy of @xmath4 ergs .",
    "if approximately @xmath5 of this energy is converted into crs , then the total power release is sufficient to maintain the cr energy density in our galaxy which is measured to be around @xmath6 ev @xmath7 .",
    "it is also now theoretically established that snr shock waves can accelerate crs up to energies close to the knee by diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) mechanism ( bell 1978 , blandford @xmath8 eichler 1987 ) . in a simple planar shocks model , such a mechanism naturally leads to a power - law spectrum of the form @xmath9 with the exponent @xmath10 for strong shocks .",
    "this value is found to be in good agreement with the radio observations of snrs ( green 2009 ) .",
    "in addition , direct evidence for the presence of high energy particles up to few tevs ( @xmath6 tev= @xmath11 ev ) inside snrs comes from the detections of non - thermal x - rays ( see e.g. , parizot et al . 2006 , bamba et al .",
    "2006 ) and high energy tev @xmath12-rays from several snrs ( e.g. , aharonian et al . 2006 , 2008a , 2008b , 2008d , albert et al .",
    "the non - thermal x - rays are best explained as synchrotron emission from high energy electrons while the origin of the tev @xmath12-rays is still not certain between the leptonic ( via inverse compton process ) and the hadronic scenarios ( via @xmath13 decays ) . if the high energy @xmath12-rays are of hadronic origin as indicated by the recent observations of several snrs by the fermi experiment ( abdo et al .",
    "2009 , 2010a , b , c ) , then the measured @xmath12-rays can provide direct informations about the spectral shape of the primary particles .",
    "but , tev measurements made by the new generation cherenkov telescopes like the hess , magic and veritas have found that many snrs show @xmath14 which is steeper than the expectations from dsa theory .",
    "the discrepancy becomes even more severe if we compare with the results of non - linear dsa theory which predicts a spectrum flatter than @xmath10 ( caprioli et al .",
    "2010 and references therein ) .",
    "although this discrepancy is still not yet fully understood , for our study we will assume that snrs are the main sources of crs in our galaxy .    quite often , theoretical studies on the propagation of crs assume the sources to be stationary and continuously distributed in the galaxy .",
    "this simple assumption seems reasonable for calculating the galactic average cr properties and for understanding the diffuse radiations produced by the interaction of crs in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "but , for cr studies in the vicinity of the sources where the influence of the source is expected to dominate over the background produced by the distant sources , the discrete nature of the sources ( both in space and time ) may become important .",
    "for instance , in the study of gamma - ray emissions from the environment of the sources or from molecular clouds associated with them , the emission can be strongly dependent on the age and the distance of the source as discussed in aharonian @xmath8 atoyan 1996 , gabici et al .",
    "2009 , casanova et al . 2010 .",
    "similarly , for the study of crs observed at the earth , the uniform source distribution looks proper only for the distant sources but for the nearby sources , a more reasonable treatment would be to consider the discrete nature of the sources . for cr electrons at few tev energies",
    ", such treatment seems even more important because of their fast energy loss rate .",
    "electrons with energies greater than @xmath15 tev can not travel distances more than @xmath15 kpc in the galaxy through diffusive propagation before they lost all their energies . therefore",
    ", high energy electrons from distant and old sources may not reach the earth effectively and it is possible that most of the tev electrons that we observe are mostly produced by few young nearby sources ( shen 1970 , atoyan et al .",
    "1995 , kobayashi et al .",
    "2004 , delahaye et al .",
    "2010 etc . ) . also for the cr",
    "protons and other nuclear species which do not suffer significant losses ( the typical nuclear fragmentation loss time scale in our galaxy @xmath16 yr ) and for which we expect a strong background from the distant sources , the discrete treatment of the nearby sources can still be important especially at higher energies ( strong @xmath8 moskalenko 2001 , bshing et al . 2005 , erlykin @xmath8 wolfendale 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "this is because high energy crs diffuse relatively faster compared to the lower energy ones and hence , they are expected to produce stronger fluctuations on their observable properties like the spectrum and the anisotropy ( thoudam 2008 ) .",
    "moreover , at these energies , the contribution from the recent sources may dominate and the effect of discreteness in time may also become important ( taillet et al . 2004 ) .    in most of the studies mentioned above , the discrete sources are assumed to be point - like , thereby neglecting their finite size and the morphology . at first sight",
    ", the point source approximation seems reasonable for sources whose size @xmath17 , the distance from the earth .",
    "but , for those whose size is comparable to the distance , the point source approximation may break down and it looks more appropriate to take their size and morphology into account . under the standard dsa theory , crs are confined within the snrs due to the strong magnetic turbulence generated by the crs themselves and therefore , it is reasonable to assume that crs remain confined as long as the shocks remain strong enough to act as an efficient accelerator . for a typical interstellar matter density of @xmath6 h @xmath7 , the confinement last until the snr age around @xmath18 yr ( berezhko @xmath8 vlk 2000 ) . in reality ,",
    "an energy dependent confinement / escape scenario is expected ( see e.g. ptuskin @xmath8 zirakashvili 2005 , caprioli et al .",
    "using the sedov relation between the snr age and the shock radius , if we assume an initial shock velocity of @xmath19 cm s@xmath3 , we can roughly estimate that at the age of @xmath18 yr the remnant expands to a size of radius around @xmath20 pc .",
    "such a size is comparable to the distance of some of the nearest snrs like the geminga and the loop1 .",
    "the distance to the geminga is estimated to be @xmath21 pc ( caraveo et al . 1996 ) and that to the loop1 as @xmath22 pc ( egger @xmath8 aschenbach 1995 ) .",
    "the argument just mentioned is purely based on the geometrical consideration , i.e. , the source size compared to its distance and we have not considered any possible effects due to the propagation of crs in the galaxy .",
    "it is now well accepted that crs undergo diffusive motion due to scattering by the magnetic field irregularities and the self excited hydromagnetic waves in the ism . measurements of secondary - to - primary ( s / p ) ratios like",
    "the boron - to - carbon indicate that the diffusion is energy dependent with the diffusion coefficient increasing with energy ( see e.g. the experiments listed in stephens @xmath8 streitmatter 1998 ) .",
    "if we also take into account such an energy dependent diffusion , the validity of the point source approximation may become somewhat relaxed for the high energy particles , i.e , it may still represent a good approximation even for the nearby sources at higher energies .",
    "we will discuss this in detail later in the paper .",
    "recently , ohira et al .",
    "2011 highlighted the importance of the finite source size in the study of gamma - ray emission from snrs interacting with molecular clouds .",
    "they claimed that the observations of different gamma - ray spectra from four snrs ( w51c , w28 , w44 and ic 443 ) by the fermi experiment could be an effect of finite size of the snrs . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the importance of the source size for the nearby snrs considering the cr spectrum expected at the earth .",
    "although snrs can have complex morphologies , that too different from each other , for simplicity we will consider a spherical geometry for our study .",
    "in one part , we will consider an energy _",
    "independent _ escape of crs from the snrs .",
    "this is discussed in sections 2 and 3 . in another part of our study",
    ", we will investigate the energy _",
    "dependent _ escape model under which crs of different energies are assumed to escape at different times .",
    "this study is given in section 4 .",
    "then in section 5 , we apply our study to the nearby known snrs and compare the results obtained under the different source models .",
    "finally in section 6 , we present an overview of our results and discuss their implications .",
    "in the diffusion model , neglecting losses due to interactions in the ism , the propagation of cr protons in the galaxy can be described by ( see e.g. gaisser 1990 and references therein ) , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the differential proton density , @xmath25 is the kinetic energy , @xmath26 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath27 is the source term , i.e. the proton production rate from the snr . in eq . ( 1 ) , we also neglect other effects which are relevant mostly below a few gevs like the convection due to the galactic wind and the reacceleration by the interstellar turbulence .",
    "we assume the diffusion coefficient to be spatially constant throughout the galaxy and take @xmath28 for @xmath29 , where @xmath30 @xmath31 s@xmath3 , @xmath32 gev and @xmath33 ( thoudam 2008 ) .",
    "these values are different from those given by models based on diffusive reacceleration .",
    "for instance , trotta et al .",
    "2011 give a value of @xmath34 @xmath31 s@xmath3 and @xmath35 .    for sources within a distance of @xmath15 kpc from the earth which are",
    "also our main interest here , thoudam 2007 showed that the cr spectrum is not much affected by the presence of the galactic boundaries .",
    "in fact , @xmath36 does depend on the boundaries and is proportional to the size of our galactic halo ( see e.g. trotta et al .",
    "2011 ) . for our present study",
    ", we neglect such dependencies and solve eq .",
    "( 1 ) without imposing any boundary conditions .",
    "we then obtain the well known green function @xmath37 , i.e. the solution for a @xmath38-function source term @xmath39 as given below , @xmath40^{3/2}}\\mathrm{exp}\\left[\\frac{-(\\textbf{r}^\\prime -\\textbf{r})^2}{4d(t - t^\\prime)}\\right]\\ ] ] the general solution of eq .",

    "( 3 ) can be written as , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the source spectrum , i.e. , @xmath44 is the number of protons with energy between @xmath25 and @xmath45 produced by the snr . for this part of our study",
    ", we assume an energy independent escape of crs from the snr .",
    "we will first consider the burst - like injection of particles followed later by the continuous injection case .",
    "later on , in section 4 we will discuss the energy dependent escape model .",

    "hereafter we take @xmath51 , i.e. , we set the origin of the coordinate system at the position of the earth .",

    "most of the snrs are observed to roughly follow a spherical geometry and they come under three main categories : shell - type , plerion - type and composite - type . shell - type snrs show bright shell structure which expands into the ism with velocities of @xmath63 cm s@xmath3 ( e.g. cassiopeia a ) .",
    "plerions also known as pulsar wind nebulae have filled center normally a pulsar powering high energy particles into the ism ( e.g. crab nebula ) .",
    "they do not show any shell - like features .",
    "composite snrs have both shell structure and filled center ( e.g. ic443 ) . the surface brightness of shell - type snrs in radio as well as in x - rays are observed to peak near the surface whereas in plerions , it tends to increase towards the center .",
    "we can expect that the high energy particles responsible for the radio and the x - ray emissions also follow a similar distribution within the remnant .",

    ", we can see that apart from the scaling down of the flux and the right shifting of @xmath102 due to the increased source distance , the differences between the different source models also become smaller .",
    "this is simply the geometrical effect mentioned in section 1 , i.e. as the source distance increases , the point source approximation becomes more valid .",
    "these results can be understood as follows .",
    "the diffusion radius @xmath105 , which is the effective distance from the snr travelled by crs due to diffusive propagation , is a strong function of @xmath36 and @xmath87 .",

    "the escape energy @xmath204 follows , @xmath205    there are strong theoretical arguments which suggest that crs might amplify the magnetic fields near the shock surface ( see e.g. caprioli et al .",
    "this idea is also supported experimentally by the recent observations of thin x - ray filaments inside several snrs , which are most likely synchrotron emissions of high energy electrons in the presence of strong magnetic fields of the order of @xmath206 g ( vlk et al .",

    "it is because shock waves traveling at some constant velocity can always overtake particles undergoing diffusive motion ( drury 2011 ) .",
    "however , during the sedov phase when the shock velocity decreases with the age @xmath87 as @xmath210 and the shock radius increases as @xmath211 , some of the high energy crs can start escaping because of their relatively larger diffusion length @xmath212 . therefore , under the sedov scaling , the escape energy at any stage during the evolution can be obtained using eq .",

    "however , unlike in the case of the protons , the total electron spectra show some irregular features near the highest energies which are due to the effects of sharp cut - offs in the individual spectra due to radiative energy losses .",
    "for instance , the strong peak at @xmath296 yr is due to the effect of sn185 . from the figure",
    ", we can notice that at energies greater than few tevs our results which are based on a pure power - law source spectrum significantly over predicts the data .",
    "taking larger values of @xmath46 can suppress the contributions of vela , g299.2 - 2.9 and sn185 which are the dominant contributors at high energies . for @xmath297 yr , their contributions will be completely removed .",
    "this points towards the importance of source modeling in order to understand the contribution of local sources in the high energy electron spectrum .",
    "one common way to handle this problem is to assume an exponential cut - off @xmath298 in the source spectrum at a few tevs ( see e.g. delahaye et al .",
    "another possibility is that the high energy electrons might have suffered significant energy losses within the snr itself before they are released into the ism ( thoudam @xmath8 hrandel 2011 ) .",

    "these features are stronger than the ones present in the proton spectrum which is due to the presence of additional breaks in the individual electron spectra at high energies .",
    "the position of these spikes not only depends on the age and distance of the individual snrs but also on the assume energy dependent escape model ( i.e. , on the parameters @xmath229 , @xmath218 and @xmath217 ) .    in fig .",

    "the point source still remains a good approximation . under the energy _",

    "for very old nearby sources ( @xmath305 yr ) , we have found that the results are independent of both the source size and the particle injection model and hence , the burst - like point source model represents a good approximation at all energies .",
    "we have also shown in fig .",
    "3 that for a given value of the cr diffusion coefficient , there is a certain parameter space in @xmath90 under which the point source approximation remains valid for crs of our interest , i.e. , with energies @xmath306 gev .",
    "when applied to the nearby known snrs within @xmath6 kpc , interestingly we have found that their total spectrum almost remain the same in the three different source models although some of the individual snrs like vela show differences between the models ( figs",

    "we found that it is because at low energies where the point source approximation is most likely to break down , the local spectrum is dominated by the monogem and the loop1 .",
    "these snrs are quite old with monogem age @xmath307 yr and loop1 @xmath308 yr due to which their cr spectra at the earth are independent of their sizes and are well represented by the point source solutions .",

    "we assumed that the escape time follows , @xmath309 with @xmath229 chosen to be equal to @xmath234 . under this model",
    ", we assumed that the highest energy particles escape the remnant at the start of the sedov phase followed by the lower energy ones at later times .",
    "for @xmath310 pev , @xmath221 yr and the maximum cr confinement time of @xmath18 yr adopted for our study , we found @xmath311 yr and the escape radius @xmath312 pc for energies @xmath313 .",
    "for young sources , the spectrum obtained under this model show breaks at lower energies which are due to the longer confinement times at those energies . at high energies ,",
    "the results are very similar to those of the point source approximation .",
    "this is not just because of the small values of @xmath225 at high energies but also due to their large values of @xmath26 at these energies .",
    "in fact , we have shown in section 2 that even for a large escape radius of @xmath20 pc , the point source still represents a good approximation at high energies ( see e.g. , fig",
    ". 1 surface source ) .",
    "therefore , it should be understood that it is not the small @xmath225 , but actually the large @xmath26 which is responsible for the point source validity at high energies under the energy dependent escape model . when applied to the nearby known snrs",
    ", we have found that the results obtained under this model are significantly different from those obtained under the point source approximation .",
    "the total local spectrum show more irregular structures as compared to the point source results .",

    "recently , kawanaka et al . 2011 proposed that such spectral features can be used to estimate the cr confinement time inside snrs .",
    "their study assumed a single nearby source having characteristics similar to that of the vela remnant . it should be noted that the position and the strength of such features strongly depend on the cr escape model especially on the @xmath229 parameter and also on @xmath320 ( if there is an exponential cut - off in the source spectrum ) . for instance , assuming @xmath321 tev would produce stronger features and vice versa compared to our results shown in fig .",
    "14 . similarly , assuming @xmath322 would produce stronger peaks at comparatively higher energies as low energy crs",
    "would be confined for relatively longer times as indicated by figs .",

    "if future better sensitive experiments like the cta and the calet provide good quality data at these energies , that would indeed provide useful informations to understand cr escapes from some of our nearby snrs .",
    "however , the large uncertainties involved in the age and the distance estimates of some of these snrs may be an issue because of the strong dependence of the cr spectrum on these parameters . regarding this",
    ", measurements of electron anisotropy both amplitude as well as its direction at these energies might also be important in order to identify the dominant source .",
    "recently , di bernardo et al .",
    "2011 studied the contributions of the nearby pulsars and the snrs to the high energy electron spectrum .",
    "one of their conclusions is that a strong contribution from the nearby snrs is not supported by the recent upper limits on the electron anisotropies provided by the fermi large area telescope observations ( ackermann et al .",
    "but , it should be noted that their calculations assumed the sources to be burst - like point sources emitting cr particles independent of energy . in fig",
    "14 , we show that between @xmath330 , the contribution from the nearby snrs is significantly larger in the point source approximation than in the energy dependent model .",
    "we believe that a more realistic treatment of particle escape model from the snrs may change their conclusion . other class of sources which might also produce significant contributions to the high energy leptonic ( electron plus positron ) spectrum are pulsars and dark matter",
    ". models based on these sources are motivated mostly by the detection of the rise in the positron fraction above @xmath331 gev by the pamela experiment ( adriani et al .",
    "if we assume that positrons are produced only during the interaction of the primary crs with the interstellar gas , the positron fraction is expected to decrease with energy which is in contrast to the observations .",
    "a possible solution to this problem among others may be the presence of one or more nearby positron sources like pulsars or dark matter ( see e.g. grasso et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) .",
    "future measurements of electron anisotropies with better sensitivities and also the absolute positron spectrum at high energies can provide better understanding of the nature and the type of the dominant source(s ) .",
    "moreover , a good understanding of the background contribution would also be crucial . in an earlier paper ,",
    "we had presented calculations of the averaged background based on a simple energy _",
