    "it is commonly believed that the hard x - ray radiation of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) or galactic black hole candidates ( gbhcs ) arises from hot gas around accreting black holes , either in forms of hot accretion flow or accretion - disk corona ( e.g. liang & nolan 1984 ; mushotzsky , done , & pounds 1993 ; narayan , mahadevan , & quataert 1998 ) .",
    "the structure of hot accretion flows , such as advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) , has been extensively investigated based on the vertically one - zone approximation ( kato , fukue , & mineshige 1998 and references therein ) . the adaf model ( ichimaru 1977 ; narayan , yi & mahadevan 1995 ; see also blandford & begelman 1999 ; igumenshchev & abramowicz 2000 for modifications )",
    "can reasonably fit the observed spectra of low luminosity agns and x - ray novae in quiescence .",
    "nevertheless , spectral features observed in ordinary agns , the big blue bump , the soft x - ray excess and hard x - ray continuum , and the 6.4 kev fluorescent iron lines , show strong observational evidence for hot gas coexisting with cool gas in the vicinity of accreting black hole ( e.g. , mushotzky et al . 1993 ) , which is presumably a corona lying above an accretion disk . in disk - corona models ,",
    "the cold disk is embedded in the hot corona in a plane - parallel slab . except for the ion - illuminated disk ( deufel & spruit 2000 ; deufel , dullemond , & spruit 2002 ) , previous disk corona models for agns or gbhcs ( haardt & maraschi 1991 ; 1993 ; nakamura & osaki 1993 ; svensson & zdziarski 1994 ; dove et al .",
    "1997 ; kawaguchi , shimura , & mineshige 2001 ) need to assume a large fraction of accretion energy to be released in the corona though the details of the coronal heating mechanism remain unclear",
    ".    detailed investigation on the interaction between an accretion disk and a friction - heated corona ( liu et al .",
    "2002b ) shows that the energy deposit in the corona is not enough to keep itself hot above the disk against strong compton cooling in agn systems .",
    "other heating besides the viscous one is required to maintain such a hot corona lying above the disk and to produce the observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "comparison of the thermal energy capacity in the corona and observed power of agns also shows energy shortage in the corona ( merloni & fabian 2001 )",
    ". one promising mechanism to heat the corona may be the magnetic reconnection ( e.g. di matteo 1998 ; di matteo , celotti , & fabian 1999 ; miller & stone 2000 ; machida , hayashi & matsumoto 2000 ) as a result of magnetorotational instabilities in the disk and the buoyancy of the magnetic field ( tout & pringle 1992 ; miller & stone 2000 ) . despite of the complex",
    "radiation and energy interaction between the disk main body and the corona , magnetic fields seem to play essential role in producing time variations and spatial inhomogeneity ( e.g. kawaguchi et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in a recent study ( liu , mineshige , & shibata 2002a , hereafter paper i )",
    ", we show that , the magnetic reconnection can indeed heat the corona to a temperature around @xmath6k and produce the observed x - ray luminosity . in the present paper",
    ", we describe the model in a more consistent way ( sect.[s : model ] ) , and then calculate the spectra from the corona and disk by monte carlo simulations .",
    "the computational results on the coronal properties and emergent spectra are presented in sect.[s : result ] .",
    "discussion on spectra is presented in sect.[s : discussion ] and our conclusions in sect.[s : conclusion ] .",
    "in our disk - corona model ( paper i ) , the disk is assumed to be a classical shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) disk .",
    "the corona is a plane - parallel corona which is tightly coupled with the underlying disk . in the disk , magnetic fields are continuously generated by dynamo action . owing to the buoyancy magnetic flux loops emerge into the corona and reconnect with other loops .",
    "thereby , the magnetic energy carried from the disk is released in the corona as thermal energy . if the density of corona is not high enough , heat is conducted by electrons from the corona to the chromosphere , resulting in mass evaporation .",
    "once the density of corona reaches a certain value , compton scattering becomes dominant in cooling , and eventually an equilibrium is established between the reconnection heating and compton cooling , a stationary corona is built up .",
    "the equations describing these processes in the corona and at the interface of disk and corona are ( see paper i ) , @xmath7 @xmath8 in stead of @xmath9 in paper i , we introduce effective optical depth , @xmath10 , which includes the isotropic incident photons undergoing up - scattering in a plane - parallel corona , @xmath11 with @xmath12 being order of unit .",
    "eq.([e : energy ] ) and eq.([e : evap ] ) determine the temperature and density in the corona as function of energy densities of magnetic field and radiation field .",
    "the magnetic field strength @xmath13 is derived by assuming equipartition of gas energy and magnetic energy in the disk , @xmath14 for a radiation pressure - dominated disk , @xmath15^{-1}r_{10}^{9\\over 16 } g;\\ ] ] for a gas pressure - dominated disk , @xmath16^{2\\over 5}r_{10}^{-{51\\over 40 } } g,\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the energy fraction dissipated in the corona ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 is taken to be the last stable orbit @xmath19 ; @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the mass of black hole , the accretion rate , the distance , the viscous coefficient , and the equipartition factor in units of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , 0.1 , and 1 , respectively .",
    "the energy density of soft photon field , @xmath28 , is contributed from both intrinsic disk radiation @xmath29 and reprocessed radiation @xmath30 of backward compton emission from the corona @xmath31",
    "@xmath32    in eq.([e : uradre ] ) , a new factor @xmath33 is added to the evaluation of seed field in haardt & maraschi ( 1991 ; 1993 ) , which includes two effects on the soft photon energy , i.e. the dependence on the coronal temperature and optical depth , and the ratio of alfvn speed to the light speed since the magnetic reconnection releases energy at alfvn speed while this energy is radiated away at light speed .",
    "now we are allowed to derive two sets of coronal solutions , corresponding to a radiation pressure - dominated disk and a gas pressure - dominated disk , respectively . from eqs.([e : energy ] ) , ( [ e : evap ] ) , ( [ e : magr ] ) , and ( [ e : uradin ] ) , we derive a coronal solution above a radiation pressure - dominated disk , @xmath34^{-1}r_{10}^{75\\over 64}\\ell_{10}^{1\\over 8}k,\\ ] ] @xmath35^{-2}r_{10}^{75\\over 32}\\ell_{10}^{-{3\\over 4 } } { \\rm cm}^{-3},\\ ] ] where the length of the magnetic loop @xmath36 is in unit of @xmath27 .    from eqs.([e : energy ] ) , ( [ e : evap ] ) , ( [ e : magg ] ) , and ( [ e : uradre ] ) , we get a coronal solution above a gas pressure - dominated disk , @xmath37^{1\\over 10}r_{10}^{-{51\\over 160}}\\ell_{10}^{1\\over 8}k,\\ ] ] @xmath38^{1\\over 5}r_{10}^{-{51\\over 80}}\\ell_{10}^{-{3\\over 4 } } { \\rm cm}^{-3}.\\ ] ]    the fraction of gravitational energy dissipated in the corona can be deduced from its definition ( paper i ) , @xmath39 replacing @xmath13 and @xmath40 by eqs.([e : magr ] ) and ( [ e : nr1 ] ) , we obtain an equation concerning @xmath0 for a radiation pressure - dominated disk , @xmath41 replacing @xmath13 and @xmath40 by eqs.([e : magg ] ) and ( [ e : ng2 ] ) , we get an equation for a gas pressure - dominated disk , @xmath42 eq.([e : fg ] ) has solutions for any accretion rate ; while eq.([e : fr1 ] ) has solutions only if @xmath43 , which gives , @xmath44 this is to say , at high accretion rate , the corona can coexist with a radiation pressure - dominated disk or a gas pressure - dominated disk ; while at low accretion rate , the corona can coexist only with the gas pressure - dominated disk .",
    "the value of critical accretion rate is related to the distances . for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 ( see next section ) , and @xmath48 , a radiation pressure - dominated disk exists around distance @xmath49 if @xmath50 ; extends to @xmath51 if @xmath52 .",
    "we will see in the following section that the spectra from a radiation pressure - dominated disk + corona and from a gas pressure - dominated disk + corona are of much difference .    solving eq.([e : fr1 ] ) ( or eq.([e : fg ] ) ) for @xmath0 for a given black hole mass and accretion rate , we determine the coronal quantities from eqs.([e : tr1 ] ) and ( [ e : nr1 ] ) ( or eqs.([e : tg2 ] ) and ( [ e : ng2 ] ) ) .",
    "the disk quantities can also be determined .",
    "we are now ready to calculate the spectrum .",
    "we use the monte carlo simulations to calculate the emergent spectrum .",
    "our model consists of a cold disk , which produces blackbody radiation at each radius with temperature @xmath53 , @xmath54 the hot corona lying above the disk is approximated as an optically thin slab with definite electron temperature and scattering optical depth for each radius .",
    "the blackbody photons emitted from the cold disk go into the corona , some of them pass through without being scattered , some of them are compton up - scattered . by tracing the photon s motion in the corona , we separately record the photons emerging from upper and lower boundaries of the slab corona : the former are the ones to be observed and the latter impinge the disk and are reprocessed as blackbody emissions .",
    "since the accretion disk is sufficiently dense , the albedo is neglected in our simulations .",
    "the spectra from different radii are added up as the total emergent spectrum .",
    "the method of the monte carlo simulation is based on pozdnyakov , sobol & sunyaev ( 1978 ) .",
    "we restrict our consideration to a thermal corona where the electrons have a maxwellian distribution , and the compton scattering is the main cooling process . since the electron - scattering optical depth in the corona is less than one , we introduce the weight @xmath55 as described by pozdnyakov et al .",
    "( 1978 ) in order to efficiently calculate the effects of multiple scattering .",
    "we first set @xmath56 for a given soft photon , then calculate the escape probability @xmath57 of passing through the slab .",
    "the quantity of @xmath58 are the transmitted portion and is recorded to calculate the penetrated spectrum or reprocessed photons according to the escape direction of the photon .",
    "the remaining weight @xmath59 is the portion that undergoes at least one scattering .",
    "if we write the escape probability after the @xmath40-th scattering as @xmath60 , the quantity @xmath61 is the transmitted portion of photons after the @xmath40-th scattering , and is recorded as upward or downward transmitted spectrum .",
    "the remaining portion @xmath62 undergoes the @xmath63-th scattering .",
    "this calculation is continued until the weight @xmath55 becomes sufficiently small .",
    "the whole process is simulated by the monte carlo method .",
    "once the coronal temperature , the optical depth and the seed soft photons are given , the mento carlo simulation can be performed and the compton scattering spectrum and luminosity coming out from both upside and downside of the corona are obtained .",
    "the questions arise , does the upward - outcoming luminosity equal to the gravitation energy released by the accretion ? does the energy density of downward - outgoing photon plus intrinsic disk radiation equal to the presumed energy density of seed soft photons ?",
    "if the seed photon energy and the effective optical depth are correctly chosen in deriving the corona temperature , density and optical depth , the answers should be affirmative .",
    "a consistent model should correctly describe the nature of corona , i.e. , the temperature , density , optical depth , etc . so that the simulations give consistent results .    in paper",
    "i , we did not introduce @xmath12 and @xmath33 , which implies @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this is to say , it is assumed that the reprocessed seed field has energy density @xmath66 and the effective optical depth is the vertical scattering optical depth @xmath67 .",
    "however , unlike in a spheric geometry , in a plane geometry the actual optical depth ( we called it the effective optical depth ) should be larger than the vertical one , since the incident photons are isotropic and undergo longer path than @xmath68 if their directions are not normal to the corona plane .",
    "furthermore , @xmath12 is expected to be independent on the system parameters ( e.g. accretion rate ) since it is only a geometric effect .",
    "the energy density of seed photon field contributed from the reprocessed photons , @xmath66 , is estimated for specific range of parameters ( e.g. haardt & maraschi 1993 ) .",
    "the precise value depends on the temperature and optical depth . in order to get consistent results , we need to adjust the presumed energy density of soft photons and the effective optical depth of the scattering medium",
    "this is why we introduce the coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath33 in this study . for simplicity",
    ", we set @xmath33 the same value at all distances though the temperature and density of the corona change a little along the distance as shown in paper i. this is reasonable since the reprocessed photons are not required to get out of the disk at the same distance where they impinge .    for a given mass of black hole and accretion rate , we first perform the computations for the case of gas pressure - dominated disk . as the first step , we start the computation with initial values @xmath69 and @xmath65 . for one grid point of radius @xmath70 ,",
    "we solve eq.([e : fg ] ) numerically and obtain a solution for @xmath0 ; then calculate the corresponding temperature @xmath71 and density in the corona from eqs.([e : tg2 ] ) and ( [ e : ng2 ] ) and hence the scattering optical depth @xmath9 , and the radiation temperature @xmath53 of seed photon field by combining eqs.([e : uradre ] ) and ( [ e : magg ] ) .",
    "with @xmath71 , @xmath9 , and @xmath53 , we perform the monte carlo simulation , record the local upwards luminosity and downwards luminosity",
    ". then we change @xmath70 to the next grid point and repeat the calculation for @xmath0 , then for @xmath71 , @xmath9 and @xmath53 , and then monte carlo simulation .",
    "finally all the local outgoing photons are added up and the integrated upward luminosity @xmath72 and downward luminosity @xmath73 are obtained . meanwhile ,",
    "the integrated soft photon energy @xmath74 and the released gravitational energy @xmath75 are also calculated . the second step is to check the consistency , i.e. @xmath76 and @xmath77 ?",
    "if yes , we find the correct @xmath12 and @xmath33 and hence the consistent solution for the corona , and stop the computation ; if no , set new values for the @xmath63-th @xmath12 and @xmath33 from the @xmath40-th results : @xmath78 and @xmath79 , then repeat the computation from the first step until the consistent conditions @xmath76 and @xmath77 are fulfilled .    in the case of radiation pressure - dominated disk ,",
    "we solve @xmath0 from eq.([e : fr1 ] ) and then the temperature and density from eqs.([e : tr1 ] ) and eqs.([e : nr1 ] ) .",
    "the iteration procedure is similar to the case of gas pressure - dominated disk .",
    "the difference is in that we only need to check whether @xmath80 is fulfilled or not , since the contribution to the seed photons from the reprocessed photons are not so important as the intrinsic disk radiations .",
    "thus , @xmath33 is simply set to unity and is not adjusted during the iteration .      for given parameters , @xmath48 , @xmath45 , @xmath81 , @xmath46",
    ", we perform computations for a series of accretion rates . as we discussed in sect.[s : model ] , computations show that , for low accretion rates ( @xmath82 ) there is only gas pressure - dominated solution ; for high mass accretion rates there are both gas pressure - dominated and radiation pressure - dominated solutions ( say , @xmath83 ) ; for middle accretion rates ( say , @xmath84 ) , the gas pressure - dominated solution exists at all distances , while the radiation pressure - dominated solution only exists at small distances . as an example for low accretion rate system , fig.[f : fmdot01 ] shows how much accretion energy is dissipated in the corona and in the disk for @xmath85 .",
    "it is shown that almost all the accretion energy is dissipated in the corona ; less than one thousandth is dissipated in the disk .",
    "the corresponding coronal structure is plotted in fig.[f : tnyhard ] .",
    "the temperature is @xmath86k and the density @xmath86@xmath87 , which are a little lower than that in paper i since here we take into account the effective optical depth and consistent seed photon field .",
    "the effect optical depth is around 0.7 and compton y - parameter 0.6 .    as an example for high accretion rate , fig.[f : fmdot2 ] and fig.[f : tnysoft ]",
    "show the energy fraction and coronal structure for an accretion rate of @xmath88 . for a gas pressure - dominated disk ,",
    "the coronal temperature and density are almost the same as that for low accretion rates . only the magnetic field and alfvn speed increase with accretion rates .",
    "this feature is the nature of gas - pressure solutions because @xmath0 depends on @xmath89 very weakly ( see eq.([e : fg ] ) ) , so are the temperature ( see eq.([e : tg2 ] ) ) and density ( see eq.([e : ng2 ] ) ) . in other words ,",
    "the coronal structures with a gas pressure - dominated disk underneath are quite uniform .",
    "higher accretion rate only results in faster energy transfer and dissipation in the corona .",
    "such features can be understood as follows .",
    "a corona coupled with the disk through the magnetic field and radiation field can self - adjust to an equilibrium at a certain temperature .",
    "the magnetic field transports almost all the accretion energy to the corona and releases the energy there through reconnection . at the beginning of reconnection",
    ", the electrons are suddenly heated to a very high temperature .",
    "even though there is no many seed photons to be scattered , the compton cooling power is still quite strong due to the very high temperature .",
    "thus , the seed photon s energy is greatly amplified .",
    "some fraction of the scattered photons get out of the corona from the backside and are reprocessed in the disk as blackbody radiation .",
    "then the seed photon field is strengthened and the electron temperature decreases due to efficient compton cooling .",
    "the equilibrium is finally reached when the heating by the magnetic reconnection balances the compton cooling .",
    "such an approach to the equilibrium can be clearly seen from our iterative computations : when @xmath33 is set to be a small value , the temperature derived from the model is high . with this high @xmath71",
    "we then obtain high backward - scattered photon luminosity ( by the monte carlo simulation ) . taking this high luminosity as the seed soft photon luminosity",
    ", the newly derived @xmath71 becomes low and hence the soft - photon field contributed from the backward compton radiation is closer to the true value . by repeating this procedure",
    ", the backward - scattered luminosity quickly converges to the seed soft luminosity , and a stationary state is reached .    in table",
    "[ t : lambda ] we list for a gas pressure - dominated disk the coefficients @xmath33 , @xmath12 , the emergent luminosity @xmath72 , the seed soft photon luminosity @xmath90 , and the amplification factor @xmath91 , where @xmath73 is the downward / backward compton luminosity .",
    "we find that the compton amplification factors for different accretion rate are almost the same , @xmath92 .",
    "soft photons are scattered in the corona , gain energy by a factor of @xmath93 and escape from both sides of the corona .",
    "the upward - escaped photons carry a little more energy ( @xmath72 ) than the downward - escaped photons ( @xmath94 ) , the latter is reprocessed as seed photons .",
    "the coefficient @xmath33 for the seed photon field increases with increasing accretion rate . comparing @xmath33 and alfvn speed , we find that @xmath95 does not change with @xmath89 .",
    "this indicates that the reprocessed photon field is actually proportional to the @xmath96 , the factor @xmath97 is due to the lag of magnetic heating ( at a speed of @xmath98 ) to radiation cooling ( at a speed of @xmath99 ) .",
    "we also find @xmath100 , independent on @xmath101 . this is to say ,",
    "the effective optical depth caused by the slab geometry is as 2.7 times large as the vertical optical depth .",

    "the seed photons are mainly from the intrinsic disk radiation .",
    "the disk and corona are not coupled at the same way as that for a gas pressure - dominated disk .",
    "in such a strong disk + weak corona system , the compton scattering in the corona is quite weak , @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "we note that , the energy fraction dissipated in the corona decreases with increasing accretion rate , the temperature and density in the corona also decrease with @xmath89 .",
    "this implies that the corona above a radiation pressure - dominated disk is weak at luminous systems .      in last section",
    "we show that there are two types of solution for the disk and corona structure .",
    "when the accretion disk is presumed to be gas pressure - dominated , we get a solution @xmath120 , indicating that most of the gravitational energy is transferred to the corona by strong magnetic field and fast reconnection .",
    "the disk is quite cool , with midplane temperature of a few @xmath121k .",
    "the corona is heated up to a temperature @xmath122k by the magnetic reconnection , and the density becomes @xmath6@xmath87 through efficient mass evaporation at the interface between the disk and the corona .",
    "the dissipated energy in the corona is emitted away by compton scattering .",
    "part of the seed photons are upward scattered as the emergent spectrum , and part of them are scattered backward , which are reprocessed in the disk surface layer and are emitted as blackbody spectra . here",
    "we assume that the irradiation by the backward compton radiation does not largely influence the internal structure of a radiative disk but only changes the temperature of the surface layer ( for details see tuchman , mineshige , & wheeler 1990 ) .",
    "therefore , the magnetic energy determined by the equipartition in the disk midplane is not affected by the irradiation .",
    "such a highly heated corona produces strong hard x - ray emission .",
    "the corona and disk are similar to the `` two phases '' discussed by haardt and maraschi ( 1993 ) .",
    "we call this solution as hard state since its spectrum is hard .",
    "fig.[f : spect - hard ] shows the spectral energy distribution of hard state for different accretion rates corresponding to different luminosities .",
    "[ here we need to point out that the energy conversion coefficient @xmath123 by accretion is not exactly 0.1 in our case . for given accretion rate",
    "we integrate the gravitational energy by @xmath124 .",
    "the total luminosity from both side of the disk and corona should be @xmath125 . for @xmath126 , @xmath127 .",
    "thus , even for @xmath128 , the luminosity is less than the eddington luminosity . ] from the figure we see that for different @xmath89 the spectral shapes in the hard state are very similar .",
    "the hard x - ray spectral index is around 1.1 , which is a little steeper than that observed in seyfert galaxies .",
    "the `` constant '' spectral index is caused by the `` uniform '' corona . as we show in sect.[s : structure ] , the coronal structure at hard state is nearly independent on the accretion rate and the compton @xmath129-parameter ( @xmath130 ) hardly changes with @xmath89 .",
    "our computational data show that the radial distributions of @xmath129-parameter are indeed the same for different @xmath101 ; @xmath129 reaches the maximum of @xmath131 in the inner region and decreases with distances ( see fig.[f : tnyhard ] ) .",
    "therefore , the hard - state spectra have similar spectral shapes .",
    "on the other hand , if the disk is presumed to be radiation pressure - dominated , there exists no solution for @xmath0 at low accretion rate . at high accretion rate ,",
    "the solution for @xmath0 is far less than 1 , indicating that magnetic buoyancy does not transfer much energy from the disk to the corona , and there is only a weak corona above the disk with low temperature and low density compared to those in the hard state .",
    "the gravitational energy is dominantly released in the disk as multi - color blackbody radiation .",
    "these photons go through the very weak corona , almost all of them penetrate the corona without being scattered .",
    "the spectral energy ( @xmath132 ) peaks at around uv to soft x - rays , dropping steeply at high frequency .",
    "we call this solution as the soft state . fig.[f : spect - soft ] shows typical spectrum of the soft state for @xmath83 ( corresponding to @xmath133 ) .",
    "the soft - state spectrum is not much different from pure - disk spectrum . for comparison the hard - state spectrum for the same @xmath89",
    "is also shown in the figure . obviously , the spectral distributions at soft and hard state are very much different",
    ". one may question whether the bremsstrahlung emissions contribute more to the hard x - rays in this state .",
    "our estimation shows that the bremsstrahlung emission power is about 5 order of magnitude less than compton radiation because the density in the soft - state corona is so low .    furthermore , there are composite solutions , in which the disk is composed of an inner radiation pressure - dominated region and an outer gas pressure - dominated region with a weak inner corona and a strong outer corona above .",
    "whether such a discontinuous disk + corona can dynamically exist is to be studied .",
    "nevertheless , the spectra from such a composite corona + disk show moderate uv - x - ray spectral indices . in fig.[f : spect - hs ] we plot such a spectrum for @xmath134 ( corresponding to @xmath135 ) .",
    "it is shown that the inner region produces soft spectra dominated by the disk radiation and the outer region produces typical hard - state spectra dominated by the corona radiation .",
    "thus , the composed spectrum is moderate : its hard x - ray spectrum has the same spectral index as that of hard state ; while the ratio of uv and x - ray luminosity , or rather , the uv - x - ray spectral index , is larger than that of hard state . with @xmath89 increases ,",
    "the inner radiation pressure - dominated region extends outwards and the outer gas - pressure dominated region shrinks .",
    "the overall spectrum then becomes softer .",
    "as discussed in sect.[s : structure ] , the hard - state solution can exist in both low- and high - luminosity objects ; while a soft - state corona extending to 50@xmath136 can only appear at high accretion rate , @xmath137 ( or @xmath4 ) .",
    "systems accreting at a rate @xmath138 ( or @xmath5 ) can be in a state between hard and soft with uv - x - ray indices varying with accretion rates .",

    "the two curves overlap .",
    "similarly , the spectra have weak dependence on the mass of black hole .",
    "but , considering large change of black - hole mass over a few orders of magnitude , the spectra may be somewhat different . in fig.[f :",
    "spect - ml ] an example of hard state for @xmath161 is shown .",
    "compared to the case for @xmath156 , the disk component shifts towards high frequency , whereas no obvious difference in the shape of hard x - ray spectra contributed by the corona . for a @xmath162 black hole",
    "we expect similar hard x - ray spectra except for the low - frequency component which peaks at soft x - rays due to high effective temperature in the disk .",
    "the dependence on @xmath155 seems large because it directly determines how much of the accretion energy transferred to the corona through magnetic field .",
    "owing to poor knowledge on the equipartition coefficient , we do nt discuss this issue here .",
    "the observed spectrum in x - ray 2 - 20 kev is close to a power law , with an averaged spectral index @xmath163 for seyfert galaxies ( mushotzky 1984 ; turner & pounds 1989 ) .",
    "taking into account the deconvolution of the compton reflection hump around @xmath16430kev ( george & fabian 1991 ; williams et al .",
    "1992 ; mushotzski et al . 1993 ; petrocci et al .",
    "2000 ) , the spectral index of the underlying power law for seyfert galaxies is 0.9 to 1.0 ( e.g. nandra & pounds 1994 ; pounds et al . 1990 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectral index for radio - quiet qsos is slightly higher , @xmath165 ( e.g. george et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the observed broad band spectral index measured between 2500@xmath166 and 2kev is 1.25 for seyferts ( walter & fink 1993 ) and 1.5 for qsos ( yuan et al .",
    "our model shows that at hard state the x - ray spectral indices between 2 - 20kev are around 1.1 .",
    "the spectral indices between the hump ( around uv ) and 2kev , @xmath141 , are around 1.4 .",
    "the hard - state spectra are roughly in agreement with the observed spectra of seyfert galaxies and qsos .",
    "the composite spectrum , which occurs only at relative high accretion rates and becomes more and more close to the soft spectrum with increase of @xmath89 , may explain the diversity of spectra observed in narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) .",
    "nls1 is a subgroup of seyfert 1 galaxies , but is characterized by large soft x - ray excess ( see fig.1 in boller 2000 ) .",
    "it has been proposed that black hole masses are systematically smaller , while luminosities are comparable to those of other seyfert 1s , leading to large @xmath167 in nls1s ( osterbrock & pogge 1985 ; boller , brandt , & fink 1996 ; mineshige et al .",
    "our composite soft spectra may correspond for various spectra observed in nls1s .",
    "furthermore , a small fraction of qsos with optical - x - ray spectral index @xmath168 are observed ( yuan et al .",
    "1998 ) , which may be interpreted by our composite soft spectra .",
    "comparison with gbhcs are another interesting , outstanding issue but is beyond the present investigation .",
    "compared with the excellent work of haardt & maraschi ( 1993 , hereafter hm93 ) , our hard - state results are quite similar to theirs .",
    "this is easy to understand , since our study on the interaction between the disk and corona shows @xmath120 , which is a basic assumption in hm93 .",
    "we also find soft - state spectra , where the corona is not coupled with the disk in the same way as that in hm93 .",
    "therefore , the spectra are different from hm93 . despite of the complexity",
    ", the basic differences can be briefly described as follows .",
    "hm93 consider the coupling between the disk and the corona through seed photons , which gives a relation between the soft radiation temperature @xmath53 , the corona temperature @xmath71 , and the optical depth @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath169 .",
    "they find for @xmath170 and @xmath171 , the relation can be approximated as @xmath172 ( where @xmath173 ) . for given @xmath53 and @xmath9 , @xmath71",
    "is determined by this approximation , and then the spectrum is obtained from the monte carlo simulations . by changing @xmath53 and @xmath9 within the limited range , they got somewhat similar spectral indices . in our model , we also consider the energy coupling between the disk and corona through the soft photons , i.e. @xmath174 .",
    "in addition , we consider the coupling by the magnetic field and get the second relation , @xmath175 .",
    "supplemented by the mass evaporation , we have the third relation , @xmath176 .",
    "therefore , we uniquely determine @xmath177 and @xmath178 for given @xmath0 , @xmath154 , and @xmath89 .",
    "then , we perform the monte carlo simulation and obtain the spectrum and upward luminosity @xmath179 . using the fourth relation of that the luminosity equals to the accretion energy , i.e. , @xmath180 , we can also determine @xmath0 .",
    "hm93 also take into account other factors like anisotropy of the seed photons . here",
    "we concentrate on the underlying physics in order to determine the corona variables .",
    "we improved our simple model presented in paper i by introducing adjustable coefficients for the energy density of the coupled seed photons and for the optical depth of plane - parallel corona . for",
    "given mass of black hole , accretion rate , and presumed coefficients , the model can determine the energy fraction dissipated in the corona and hence determine the structure of both the corona and disk .",
    "then , we perform monte carlo simulations to trace the motion of photons in the corona and record the upward photons ( emergent luminosity ) and the backward photons . by comparing the presumed seed photon energy and the sum of intrinsic disk radiation and backward radiation energy ,",
    "we adjust the coefficient of soft photon field and ; by comparing the total accretion energy and the simulating emergent luminosity , we modify the effective optical depth in the slab geometry . repeating this procedure , we finally obtain the self - consistent solutions for the corona and also for the disk , both of which are coupled by the magnetic field and the radiation field .",
    "we find two types of solutions for the disk and corona structure , corresponding for the hard - state and soft - state spectra . in the hard - state solution ,",
    "the accretion disk is gas pressure - dominated .",
    "most of the accretion energy is transferred to the corona by the magnetic field , and the intrinsic disk radiation is very weak .",
    "the corona and disk are tightly coupled through the radiation field and , consequently , the hard x - ray spectral indices are almost fixed at @xmath181 . in the soft - state solution ,",
    "most of the accretion energy is dissipated in the disk and thus the disk is radiation pressure - dominated .",
    "the corona is weak , characterized by lower temperature and density , and is no longer strongly coupled with the disk through seed photons .",
    "the emergent spectral energy comes mainly from the un - scattered intrinsic disk radiation , peaking at uv and soft x - rays .",
    "the soft states appear at only very high luminosity ; while hard states appear at both high and low luminosities .",
    "a state between soft and hard , composed of an inner soft - sate solution and an outer hard - state solution , is also possible for a moderately luminous system .",
    "our model predicts that the spectra is hard from low - luminosity objects with @xmath3 ; while the spectra can be either hard or soft from high - luminosity objects with @xmath4 .",
    "spectra from objects with luminosity @xmath5 can be hard , and can also be moderately soft , which is softer at higher luminosity .",
