    "over more than 30 years since it was firstly introduced , the cosmic inflation @xcite has been and still is the most promising paradigm describing the universe at its very early stage .",
    "it asserts that the universe has experienced a period of near exponential expansion with huge hubble parameter @xmath0 up to @xmath1 , and the quantum fluctuations of spacetime during this period have seeded the density perturbations that in turn shape the large scale structure of the universe as we see today .",
    "the ongoing observations of cosmological microwave background and large scale structure have achieved impressive precision , from which valuable information about primordial density perturbations can be extracted .",
    "for example , at the linear level , the scalar tilt of power spectrum has been measured with less - than-1% accuracy @xcite , together with the upper bound on the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xcite , this has put nontrivial constraint on inflation models .",
    "going beyond the linear level , a vast number of potential observables are available in the form of non - gaussianity of primordial fluctuations , of which the simplest type is the bispectrum @xmath2 , coming from the 3-point correlation function @xmath3 of curvature perturbation @xmath4 ( or , similarly , of tensor perturbation ) .",
    "the bispectrum contains information about interactions of inflaton fields with both itself and other fields . due to the very high energy during inflation , particles with mass up to @xmath5",
    "can be produced through quantum fluctuation .",
    "if such fields couple to inflaton , they can leave observable signal on the bispectrum of inflaton @xcite .",
    "this process strongly resembles the workings of a particle collider .",
    "the cosmic expansion itself plays the role of an accelerator , while the final states of particle collision can be recorded in the non - gaussianities , such as bispectrum @xmath2 , etc .    from the bispectrum @xmath2",
    "we may be able to extract useful information about massive particles @xmath6 created during inflation , due to its interaction with the inflaton field @xmath7 .",
    "this `` discovering channel '' of new physics is the so - called squeezed limit of @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath8 . in this channel , an intermediate particle of mass @xmath9 and spin @xmath10 will generate a characteristic signal of the following form @xcite , [ sqbispec ] s(k_1,k_2,k_3)c(_s)()^_sp_s()+(- ) , where @xmath11 is a constant dependent on both @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and @xmath12 is the angle between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "taking @xmath15 for an example , we have @xmath16 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath17 is of @xmath18 when @xmath19 but goes like @xmath20 when @xmath21 .",
    "consequently , a scalar with @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) will generate oscillating ( scaling ) signals characterized by the imaginary ( real ) part of @xmath11 .",
    "one may attempt to conclude from above discussion that the detection of a signal in form of eq.(1 ) in the squeezed limit of bispectrum would imply the existence of a new particle with mass @xmath19 , and this may constitutes an ideal explorer of new physics , given the fact that the hubble parameter during inflation is typically much larger than electroweak scale , i.e. , the cosmological collider typically have much higher energy than any real particle collider one would ever dream of",
    ".    however , it would be premature to attribute any signal like ( [ sqbispec ] ) to new physics at scale @xmath0 .",
    "in ordinary particle collider , it is extremely important to study the background signals from known physics , before we can claim any discovery of new physics .",
    "the same reasoning applies also to the cosmological collider , in which the known physics , i.e. the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , can generate interesting background .",
    "a careful study of this sm background would be the prerequisite for using the cosmological collider to explore any new physics .",
    "any observational signal that deviates from this background would then be a sign of physics beyond the sm .    in this work",
    "we describe the sm background in the cosmological collider based on generic single field slow - roll inflation .",
    "this task consists of two steps .",
    "the first step is to work out the sm spectrum during inflation , which turns out to be dramatically different from the usual one in electroweak broken phase .",
    "the second one is to figure out how the sm fields couple to the inflaton field and how they enters the bispectrum . in both steps one needs a careful treatment of loop corrections in inflation background , which is both technically difficult and conceptually subtle . in this paper",
    "we shall focus on the physical interpretation of these results , and leave the detailed analysis of loop corrections to a companion publication @xcite .",
    "during inflation , the mass spectrum of sm depends not only on the background value of higgs field , but also on the gravitational coupling and inflaton coupling of sm fields .",
    "the quantum corrections turn out to be very important , too . to take account of all these factors more concretely , we assume the sm fields couple to gravity minimally , except for the unique dim-4 nonminimal coupling @xcite between the higgs field and ricci scalar @xmath24 which can _ a priori _ be large @xcite .",
    "we also assume generic single field slow - roll inflation models with the inflaton field @xmath7 , and assume that the inflaton couples to sm fields through the following terms in the lagrangian , @xmath25,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 , @xmath27 $ ] represents any operator made from sm fields , denoted collectively by @xmath6 , and @xmath28 are functions of @xmath29 which serve as a general parameterization of inflation - sm coupling .",
    "if the inflaton is sm gauge singlet , then so is @xmath30 .",
    "but it is possible that the inflaton carries some sm charge , such as the case of higgs inflation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we may also expect @xmath28 to depend on @xmath31 only due to the shift symmetry of inflaton field .",
    "but this is not compulsory as the shift symmetry is not exact .",
    "since the background value of higgs field plays a crucial role in determining the sm spectrum , we should distinguish three broad classes of possibilities :    1 .",
    "_ low scale inflation _ :",
    "the hubble scale @xmath0 during inflation is much smaller than the electroweak broken scale .",
    "the higgs field has the usual vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath32gev , and the sm spectrum during inflation is the same as in flat space .",
    "non - higgs inflation _ : the hubble scale @xmath0 is much larger than the electroweak broken scale and the inflaton is not the sm higgs , so that higgs vev remains zero during inflation .",
    "higgs inflation _ :",
    "the sm higgs boson itself is the inflaton . in typical higgs inflation models",
    ", the normalized higgs field acquires huge ( time - dependent ) vev during inflation , usually around planck scale @xmath33gev .",
    "the case 1 is least interesting as it implies that the cosmological collider would have much lower energy than artificial colliders .",
    "we shall not consider this possibility from now on . on the other hand",
    ", the sm spectrum turns out to be very different in cases 2 and 3 , both of which are very interesting as the cosmological collider achieves its full superiority .",
    "below we describe these two cases in more detail .    in non - higgs inflation with @xmath34 ,",
    "the higgs vev remains zero during inflation , based on which one may naively expect that all sm fields remain massless .",
    "however , the situation is more complicated .",
    "first of all , within our current framework , the higgs mass is affected at classical level by the following three operators in the lagrangian , @xmath35 and the higgs field acquires a tree - level mass , m_h0 ^ 2= , where @xmath36 is the background value of @xmath31 . since the value of nonminimal coupling @xmath37 and background values of @xmath38 functions are unknown , and @xmath37 can be a priori large , we should treat the tree - level higgs mass @xmath39 as a free parameter .",
    "secondly , an important point to note is that quantum corrections can generate nonzero contribution to higgs mass even when @xmath40 .",
    "this is largely due to the infrared divergence ( or late - time growth in the context of inflation ) of loop correction @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the loop - corrected higgs mass is given by , [ higgsmeff ] m_h^2=h^2 , where @xmath41 is higgs self - coupling in sm , @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the complementary error function .",
    "the above result reduces to the following one when @xmath40 , m_h^2=h^2 .",
    "another striking phenomenon in inflation is that the gauge fields can also acquire nonzero mass , even the higgs vev remains zero .",
    "this is again due to the infrared divergence of loop correction .",
    "the loop correction to gauge boson mass can be calculated either using real time schwinger - keldysh ( sk ) formalism , with dynamical renormalization group resummation of infrared divergence @xcite , or wick - rotating the spacetime and evaluating loop diagrams directly in euclidean ds @xcite .",
    "both methods yield the same results , i.e. , the gluon still remains massless during inflation , while @xmath44 bosons and photon all acquire nonzero mass .",
    "furthermore , there is a mass - mixing between @xmath45 boson and photon , and after diagonalizing the mass matrix , we can express the gauge boson mass in terms of mass eigenstate @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , up to small corrections , as , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the weak gauge coupling and @xmath51 is the weinberg angle . on the other hand , the fermions always remain massless during inflation so long as higgs vev is zero .    it should be noted that the coupling constant @xmath50 in ( [ mw ] ) also receives corrections from operators in ( [ infsmcoup ] ) , including @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and the corrected @xmath50 is related to its sm value @xmath54 via @xmath55 .",
    "similar corrections also apply to other sm couplings .",
    "generally this would make the sm background rather arbitrary , but tractable cases do exist when the background values of various @xmath56 functions are small enough , and in such cases one can make certain predictions to sm spectrum .",
    "with sm spectrum in non - higgs inflation clarified , now we turn to typical higgs inflation , where the higgs field itself is the inflaton and acquires a huge vev around the planck scale . to be more specific , let s take the original higgs inflation model as an example .",
    "there the higgs inflaton @xmath57 at the beginning of observable inflation . as a result ,",
    "all charged fermions and @xmath44 bosons acquire masses proportional to their higgs coupling and also to the higgs vev , but with @xmath58gev replaced by the quantity @xmath59 , where @xmath37 can be as large as @xmath60 in typical higgs inflation models . on the other hand ,",
    "the higgs fluctuation has no well - defined mass , as the higgs field itself is the rolling inflaton and does not sit in a local minimum of its potential .",
    "the main results of this section are summarized in fig.[fig_smsp ] , in which we plot the sm spectrum normalized by the hubble scale @xmath0 . for illustration ,",
    "the hubble scale is fixed to the value in typical higgs inflation model , @xmath61gev . for non - higgs inflation cases ( left 3 columns ) ,",
    "all @xmath56 functions are assumed to be small and neglected .",
    "all sm couplings are extrapolated to hubble scale by 2-loop renormalization group running .",
    ", respectively .",
    "the rightmost column corresponds to the original higgs inflation model.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]",
    "given the sm spectrum during inflation , now we are going to figure out the signals of sm fields in the bispectrum of curvature perturbation .",
    "all sm fields are charged under sm gauge group and thus are produced in pairs .",
    "therefore , sm fields contribute to 3-point correlation of inflaton fields starting from the 1-loop level , and an example of this contribution is shown in fig.[fig_smloop ] .",
    "there is also a 1-loop diagram with three 3-point vertices , but it is expected to be subdominant due to a further suppression factor @xmath62 .",
    "field represents any of sm fields.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    it is important to specify the sm - inflaton couplings ( [ infsmcoup ] ) in order to evaluate diagrams such as in fig.[fig_smloop ] . at 1-loop level ,",
    "the only relevant operators @xmath30 are those quadratic in sm fields .",
    "if we further restrict our attention to scalar operators with dimension no greater than 4 , then there are only 4 terms , @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes all charged fermions and @xmath65 is corresponding covariant derivative , @xmath66 is the quadratic part of gauge kinetic term and @xmath67 s represent the sm gauge fields , and we have made a further simplifying assumption that various @xmath56 functions depend only on @xmath31 but not directly on @xmath7 , i.e. we are considering the leading order under the approximate shift symmetry .",
    "we further separate the inflaton into background value and fluctuation as @xmath68 . then , the operator @xmath69 couples to the inflaton fluctuation according to , @xmath70\\mathcal{o}_\\al,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 , and the subscript 0 indicates that the background value has been taken .",
    "it is also reasonable to drop off the last term which is proportional to @xmath62 and is expected to be much smaller than the other term .",
    "then it is straightforward to apply the sk formalism to calculate the three point correlation of @xmath72 , @xmath73,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime @xmath74 indicates that the delta function of momentum conservation has been amputated , @xmath75 is the sk propagator of inflaton with momentum @xmath76 from conformal time @xmath77 to @xmath78 , and the summation goes over all sk contours .",
    "it is in general quite difficult to carry out the integral ( [ dephi3 ] ) in closed form .",
    "however , if we are only concerned with the scaling / oscillating behavior as non - integer powers of @xmath79 in the squeezed limit @xmath80 , i.e. the `` non - local '' part , it is possible to get analytical expressions for ( [ dephi3 ] ) , by expanding the correlator @xmath81 in the @xmath82 limit . remarkably , the result is free of uv divergence , and does present non - integer power in momentum ratio @xmath79 .",
    "here we present the results in terms of curvature perturbation @xmath83 , using the relation @xmath84 , and the following standard parameterization , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the scalar power spectrum .",
    "then , in the squeezed limit @xmath87 , the non - local part of ( [ dephi3 ] ) with @xmath69 can be collectively written in terms of @xmath2 in ( [ zeta3 ] ) as , [ salpha ] s_=\\ {    & _ ( ) ^a_s-2_s+(_s-_s ) , & _ s + & 2,&_s    .",
    "where @xmath88 , and @xmath89 is the mass of the fields in @xmath30 .",
    "the spin @xmath10-dependent parameter @xmath90 and @xmath91 , for @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "the coefficient @xmath93 depends on the choice of @xmath30 . for dim-2 operator @xmath94 , this coefficient is given by @xmath95 , and @xmath96",
    "is a function of @xmath97 which is suppressed as @xmath98 when @xmath99 but enhanced as @xmath100 when @xmath101 . on the other hand , for dim-4 operators @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and the coefficient @xmath104 depends on @xmath11 only , and is again suppressed by @xmath98 when @xmath99 .",
    "some features of ( [ salpha ] ) are worth mentioning .",
    "firstly , for sufficiently light particle , i.e. @xmath105 , the power @xmath11 is real and positive . in this case , the squeezed limit of bispectrum shows characteristic scaling behavior with ( generally ) non - integer exponent @xmath11 . on the other hand , for heavy particle with mass @xmath106",
    ", @xmath11 is imaginary and the corresponding bispectrum shows oscillating behavior .",
    "both scaling and oscillating behaviors are distinctive signals of massive fields .",
    "remarkably , massive fermions always show oscillating signal rather than scaling .",
    "secondly , the boltzmann suppression @xmath107 appears in all cases , which means that we should not hope to observe particles with mass much larger than @xmath0 .",
    "thirdly we comment on the observability of this sm background .",
    "future experiments in large scale structure surveys @xcite and the 21 cm tomography @xcite are expected to significantly improve the constraints on primordial non - gaussianities . in particular , for the specific type of signals that we are interested in , the future 21 cm experiments can in principle be sensitive to @xmath108 @xcite . comparing this with our results for @xmath109 , and taking @xmath110 for the moment",
    ", we see that the sm background would be detectable if @xmath111 and @xmath112",
    ". this condition can be further loosen for sufficiently light bosons ( @xmath113 ) , because in this case the @xmath114 factors for @xmath94 and @xmath115 operators are greatly enhanced and can be much larger than @xmath18 .    to conclude this section , we note an interesting window of parameter space in which the sm background becomes both predictable and observable .",
    "this corresponds to region where @xmath116 are sufficiently small but @xmath117 are sufficiently large . in this case",
    "the sm spectrum is not affected by the sm - inflaton couplings , and we may even hope to _ calibrate _ the cosmological collider using this well - defined and distinct sm signal .",
    "in effective field theory formulation of inflation , this parameter range is likely to be unnatural . on the other hand , in the simplest case where @xmath118 , the amplitude of oscillating / scaling signal in the bispectrum is unobservably small ,",
    "so the sm background is negligible for the cosmological collider .",
    "nonetheless , it is a very interesting open problem to investigate if this observable `` calibrating '' region can be realized in complete models of inflation .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the mass spectrum of sm during inflation and how this spectrum can be revealed in the squeezed limit of bispectrum of curvature perturbation . the corresponding sm signature constitutes the background signal in the discovering channel of new physics at inflation scale on the cosmological collider .",
    "loop corrections turn out to be crucial in determining both mass spectrum of sm and bispectrum of curvature perturbation . in @xcite",
    "it is explained in more details how to do loop calculation neatly by wick rotating the inflation background to euclidean ds .",
    "an important lesson from this study is that a detection of the scaling / oscillating signal with apparent mass @xmath119 and spin @xmath10 does not necessarily imply a new heavy particle with measured mass and spin ; it may also come from a known particle whose mass is affected by quantum correction or inflaton background .",
    "similarly , starting from 1-loop order , the angular dependence in the bispectrum indicates only the total angular momentum of loop particles , rather than the intrinsic spin of a single particle .",
    "many problems along this direction remain to be explored .",
    "a more systematic study of the sm background is needed , probably using a more general effective field theory formulation of inflation - sm system . at the same time",
    ", it is also desirable to work out the sm signals in concrete models of inflation , in particular in the `` calibration limit '' . in the latter case one",
    "may also expect to discriminate inflation models using sm signals .",
