    "the non - mesonic weak decay ( nmwd : @xmath0n@xmath4nn ) of @xmath0-hypernuclei gives us a very unique opportunity to study baryon - baryon weak interaction .",
    "there exist several experimental observables ; life times(total decay rates ) , branching ratios(@xmath5(@xmath0p@xmath4np ) , @xmath5(@xmath0n@xmath4nn ) ) , etc .",
    "the asymmetry parameter of decay proton from the @xmath0p@xmath4np process , , is another important observable to investigate the reaction mechanism of nmwd , because it comes from the interference between the parity - conserving and parity - violating amplitudes .",
    "the decay angular distribution of protons from the nmwd of polarized hypernuclei , @xmath6(@xmath7 ) , is expressed as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the asymmetry , @xmath10 denotes the polarization of a @xmath0-hypernucleus , and @xmath7 means the emission angle of protons with respect to the polarization axis .",
    "so far , two experiments reported the asymmetry parameters of the nmwd s of @xcite and @xcite . in kek - ps e160 ,",
    "a large negative @xmath11 of -1.3@xmath120.4 was observed for p - shell hypernuclei@xcite , while the @xmath11 of was measured to be 0.24@xmath120.22 by kek - ps e278@xcite .",
    "there is a large discrepancy between two values , which might suggest the difference of the reaction mechanisms of the nmwd s between s - shell and p - shell hypernuclei .",
    "however , it would be too early to draw a conclusion in taking account of the statistical significance of the data and the systematic errors between two different measurements .",
    "thus , a new measurement with improved statistics and better systematic errors had been awaited .",
    "from year 2000 to 2002 , we performed two series of experiments to measure the nmwd of @xmath13he ( e462 ) and @xmath14c ( e508 ) in the k6 beamline at the kek 12-gev ps with the high - resolution and large - acceptance sks spectrometer .",
    "the ( @xmath15 , k@xmath16 ) reactions at 1.05 gev/@xmath3 were used to produce highly - polarized @xmath0 hypernuclei with respect to the horizontal reaction plane .",
    "two decay counter systems were installed symmetrically above and below the target to detect decay protons from nmwd .",
    "each system consisted of a set of drift chambers , two sets of timing counters and a neutron counter array with six layers of plastic counters .",
    "[ mhy_e462 ]       [ mhy_e508 ]    figure  [ mhy ] shows excitation energy spectra of ( left ) and ( right ) in three different conditions : from top to bottom , inclusive spectra , those with a pion coincidence , and with a proton coincidence .",
    "we succeeded to detect 52,000 events of the ground state and 67,000 events of the ground state , whose statistics are several times higher than the previous measurements .",
    "the substitutional states of at around 10 mev excitation region , whose selection gate is shown in the figure , are open for proton emission , i.e. it goes to .",
    "the asymmetry , @xmath9 , in eq .",
    "( [ asymdefeq ] ) is obtained from the ratio , @xmath17 , of numbers of decay particles emitted to the parallel and anti - parallel directions with respect to that of the hypernuclear polarization .",
    "owing to the large acceptance of sks spectrometer , we can polarize the hypernucleus upward(downward ) by selecting the ( @xmath1,k@xmath2 ) scattering direction on the left(right ) at one setup .",
    "then , the @xmath17 is expressed as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes the yield of the up ( down ) counter system at the scattering angle to the left ( right ) . in this expression , systematic errors coming from the differences of detection efficiencies and acceptances between the up and down decay counter systems are canceled out in the first order .",
    "in fact , we found the asymmetries of pions and protons from the ( @xmath15 , p ) reaction , in which we do nt expect any asymmetries , were less than 0.3% .    as shown in eq .",
    "( [ asymdefeq ] ) , we need to know the polarization of a @xmath0 hypernucleus to obtain the asymmetry parameter of proton . in the case of , assuming the asymmetry parameter of the mesonic weak decay , , is same as that in free space(-0.642@xmath120.013 ) , we can measure the polarization of the from the pion decay asymmetry . in the case of p - shell hypernuclei , however , it is hard to estimate the polarization from the experimental data , because mesonic decay mode is suppressed due to pauli blocking , and we do nt have a good estimate of . therefore , we needed to estimate the polarization of p - shell hypernuclei with a help of a theoretical calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite .     +    figure  [ asympara ] shows a preliminary result of proton asymmetries in the decay of measured in different scattering angles , 6@xmath2015@xmath21 , as a function of the polarization of obtained from the mesonic decay .",
    "the slope of the linear fit corresponds to the , and we found it to be 0.07@xmath120.08@xmath22 . as a systematic error , we took into account the effect of a small amount of pion contamination into protons , which tends to reduce the proton asymmetry to the negative side .",
    "we confirmed the very small positive value of reported by ajimura @xcite with improved accuracy .",
    "in addition , we found @xmath11 of p - shell hypernuclei obtained from a weighted average of each hypernucleus to be almost zero ( -0.24@xmath230.26@xmath22 ) as shown in fig .",

    "note that the present result is twice more accurate than the previous result . the ( p - shell ) of our result is rather consistent with that of .",
    "it suggests that the decay mechanism of p - shell hypernuclei is similar to that of s - shell hypernuclei .",
