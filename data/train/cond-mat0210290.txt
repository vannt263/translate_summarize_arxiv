    "transport through open chaotic systems is often viewed as a scattering process .",
    "standard examples of systems of that kind are compound - nuclei , mesoscopic quantum dots and wires , microwave cavities and acoustic or ultrasonic bodies [ 1 - 12 ] .",
    "incident waves are introduced into a disordered or irregularly shaped part of the structure via channels , e.g. waveguides or infinitely long ideal leads .",
    "assuming negligible dissipation , transport properties are obtained by relating incident and outgoing wave fields in terms of the unitary scattering matrix @xmath0",
    ". if internal dissipation is not negligible , it can be simulated by the action of additional open channels @xcite .",
    "this is the case , for example , with microwave cavities where non - perfectly reflecting walls cause loss of wave energy or with ultrasonic solids where internal friction acts in the bulk @xcite .",
    "the scattering model thus applies to open systems both with and without internal dissipation .",
    "the scattering approach provides a useful tool for statistical characterization of chaotic transport . assuming the wave dynamics inside the system to be ergodic so that the entire phase space of the system is explored [ 2 - 6 ] , the scattering approach is combined with a statistical analysis based on random matrix theory . for systems without losses , one can make assumptions on the statistics of the @xmath0-matrix @xcite .",
    "an alternative method uses a random matrix assumption on the level of the wave equation associated with the closed non - dissipative structure . here",
    "the basic object is the green function ( resolvent ) related to that wave equation , and the method works equally well in both open and closed , dissipative and non - dissipative complex structures [ 1 - 9,10,12 ] .",
    "matrices from a random matrix ensemble then replace the wave equation s linear differential operator , and the problem of constructing various moments of the transport characteristics is expressed in terms of ensemble averages of the products of the resolvents .",
    "transport characteristics calculated in that way are known , under certain conditions , to describe results of experimental measurements in systems with ergodic wave motion [ 1 - 6 ] .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in characterizing the wave power @xmath1 transmitted between a source at site @xmath2 and a receiver at site @xmath3 in a closed system with internal losses .",
    "the statistics of @xmath1 are potentially useful for studies of power transmission in complex reverberant structures [ 12 - 14 ] , where both mean power and the magnitude of its fluctuations away from the mean are important . in particular",
    ", we wish to calculate average @xmath1 and @xmath4 with the ultimate goal to compare with measurements such as these of ref .",
    "the complex amplitude of the transmitted wave is simply proportional to the off - diagonal matrix element of the resolvent : @xmath5 @xmath6^{-1}$ ] . here",
    "@xmath7 corresponds to the hamiltonian of the closed non - dissipative chaotic structure .",
    "the matrix @xmath8 describes coupling to external channels or internal local - in - space losses , @xmath9 is the identity matrix , the parameter @xmath10 describes uniform dissipation and @xmath11 is the spectral variable .",
    "the quantity of prime interest is @xmath12 , i.e. the product of retarded and advanced greens functions ( propagators ) : @xmath13 @xmath6_{ji}^{-1}$ ] and @xmath14 respectively .  except for slowly varying factors of receiver gain and source strength , the quantity @xmath1 represents the ultrasonic power of ref .",
    "[ 12 ] ; see also [ 10,13 ] .",
    "the fluctuations in @xmath1 , as measured in ref .",
    "[ 12 ] were in only modest agreement with theoretical predictions based on a simplified version of the random matrix approach .",
    "the moments of @xmath1 were calculated there using a naive form of ensemble averaging , [ 8,12 - 14 ] .",
    "this relatively simple approach uses statistical assumptions for eigenfunctions and the real parts of the eigenvalues of the open ( dissipative ) system identical to those of the corresponding closed system .",
    "as will be seen later , such an assumption is strictly justified only for a special case of uniform dissipation . in a more general situation",
    "this approach fails . a proper treatment calls for a more elaborate technique , which we outline and present below .    when losses are negligible the systems discussed in ref .",
    "[ 12 - 14 ] are invariant under time reversal . the appropriate choice for the corresponding random matrix @xmath7 should therefore be a real symmetric matrix taken e.g. from the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) . in principle",
    ", the powerful methods of ensemble averaging we employ here can be used for such an ensemble , but the calculations are technically involved and will be presented in a separate publication .    here",
    "we address ourselves to the somewhat simpler case in which @xmath7 is complex hermitian , generic for systems with broken time reversal invariance .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath7 is treated as a hermitian @xmath15 matrix consisting of uncorrelated centered random complex numbers , their variances defined by : @xmath16 with angular brackets indicating ensemble averaging .",
    "such an @xmath7 is a member of the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) of random matrices [ 1 ] .",
    "although our present results on the statistics of @xmath1 are not directly applicable to the time - reversal invariant systems discussed in [ 12 - 14 ] , they may elucidate the discrepancies found in ref .",
    "[ 12 ] between measurements and the predictions of the naive averaging",
    ". they also develop and illustrate the mathematical methods which will be used for a proper non - perturbative analysis of the time reversal - invariant problem .",
    "the present calculations are also relevant for scattering systems with broken time reversal invariance as exemplified in certain chaotic billiards [ 8 ] , optical and semiconductor superlattices [ 15 ] and quantum graphs [ 16 ] . in fact",
    ", our results on the distribution of the _ off - diagonal _ elements of the resolvent extend earlier studies concentrated on _ diagonal _ entries for the same quantity , see [ 22 - 23 ] and references therein .",
    "let us finally mention that there exist clear analogy between our research and that presented in the paper [ 19 ] , see also the review [ 20 ] .",
    "however , the model considered in [ 19 - 20 ] did not take local dampers into account , but rather addressed effects of anderson localization .",
    "the damping matrix @xmath8 is in general hermitian positive semi - definite . in our model",
    "there is no loss of generality in assuming it to be diagonal . indeed , in view of the rotational invariance of the gaussian unitary ensemble : @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) we always can select the basis which diagonalizes @xmath8 , bringing it to the form @xmath19 .",
    "the number @xmath20 of non - zero entries can be interpreted either as a number of equivalent open channels in the scattering system [ 3,4,9 ] or a number of equivalent localized dampers in a closed system with losses .",
    "while we take all the @xmath21s to be equal , the expressions we develop are easily generalized to the case of varying damper strengths .",
    "it should be stressed that in general the matrices @xmath8 and @xmath7 do not commute , and therefore the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath22 are not trivially related to those of @xmath7 .",
    "this very fact makes the naive averaging incorrect .",
    "in contrast , the term @xmath23 interpreted as the uniform damping preserves eigenvectors of @xmath7 and just adds a uniform shift @xmath24 to all eigenvalues .",
    "the presence of an @xmath15 random hamiltonian @xmath7 in the expression for the resolvent matrix @xmath25 enables us to carry out the ensemble averaging exactly using the supersymmetry method [ 3,4,17,18,20,21 ] .",
    "application of this non - perturbative technique leads to an expression for the entire probability distribution function of @xmath1 .",
