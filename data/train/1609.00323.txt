    "the correlations among the constituent particles of physical systems are of central importance for science @xcite . in quantum information science ( qis )",
    "@xcite , there are several types of correlations @xcite .",
    "entanglement is one kind of quantum correlation , one which is widely recognized as being the fuel for the more efficient realization of several information manipulation tasks @xcite .",
    "entanglement quantifiers ( eqs ) are functions which are null only for states that can be prepared using local quantum operations and classical communication ( the separable states ) and which do not increase under such kind of transformation @xcite . nowadays",
    ", there are several proposals of eqs in the literature @xcite .",
    "one common feature of these quantities is that they are very hard to compute analytically in the general case @xcite .",
    "this motivates the consideration of entanglement functions ( efs ) , which possess some , but not all , of the properties one may request for a good eq .",
    "the partial transposition ( pt ) provides the most famous and tractable separability criterion and efs @xcite , and is relevant for a myriad of investigations in qis .    in this article",
    ", we present a detailed description of the partial transposition map and of related efs .",
    "in addition to that , we obtain an analytical formula for the hilbert - schmidt entanglement ( hse ) of two - qudit - level quantum system . ]",
    "systems and for the associated nearest separable state .",
    "we also describe fortran code produced to compute all the functions regarded here .",
    "the remainder of this article is structured as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we start introducing the transposition map ( sec .",
    "[ transp ] ) . in the sequence",
    "we use it to discuss the partial transposition operation in the contexts of bipartite ( sec .",
    "[ sec : pt2 ] ) and of multipartite discrete systems ( sec .",
    "[ sec : pt3 ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ peres ] , we recall the peres separability criterion and some related efs . the analytical calculation of the hse is addressed in sec . [",
    "sec : hse ] . some final remarks and open questions",
    "are included in sec .",
    "before introducing the partial transposition map , let s discuss the transposition operation .",
    "let @xmath0 be a general linear operator defined on the hilbert space @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath2 be an orthonormal basis for @xmath1 , with @xmath3 .",
    "then we can write the matrix representation : @xmath4 in the sequence , @xmath5 is assumed to be the standard computational basis in @xmath1 . by definition ,",
    "the _ transposition _ map @xmath6 is linear and acts on the computational basis as follows : @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "thus , @xmath9 hence the familiar relation between the matrix elements of @xmath0 and of @xmath10 is obtained , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "we remark that the definition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tmap ] ) is base dependent .",
    "so , for another basis @xmath12 with @xmath13 ( @xmath14 is the identity operator in @xmath1 ) , the last simple relation would be valid only for the `` rotated '' versions of @xmath10 and of @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "let s end this sub - section observing that once we have @xmath16 @xcite and @xmath17 , then the eigenvalues of @xmath10 are the same as those of @xmath0 .",
    "an immediate consequence of this result is that their traces are also equal , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "thus , if @xmath0 is a density operator , i.e. , it is positive semidefinite ( @xmath19 ) and has unit trace @xmath20 ) , then @xmath10 is also a valid density operator .",
    "this fact is key for the peres separability criterion , which shall be recalled in sec .",
    "[ peres ] .      in what follows",
    "we shall introduce the partial transposition ( pt ) operation and obtain expressions which are useful for its numerical implementation .",
    "let s start regarding a bipartition of @xmath1 , @xmath21 , with dimensions @xmath22 for @xmath23 .",
    "any computational base state in @xmath1 can be cast in terms of the local computational bases as follows : @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the computational basis in @xmath26 .",
    "hereafter , we assume the the matrix elements of @xmath0 in the product - local computational basis @xmath27 are known : @xmath28    with this , we are ready to introduce the , also linear , _ partial transposition _",
    "operator , which , when taken over sub - system @xmath29 , is defined by @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the identity map , i.e. , @xmath32 for all linear operator @xmath33 on @xmath26 .",
    "so , @xmath34    in an analogous manner , when applied to sub - system @xmath35 the partial transpose leads to @xmath36    in terms of matrix elements we get @xmath37 for numerical calculations , with the notation @xmath38 , we just set @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 for all @xmath42 .",
    "the pt for bipartite systems is returned by the subroutines ` partial_transpose_s(d_{a } , d_{b } , \\rho , t_{s}(\\rho ) ) ` , with @xmath43 .",
    "let s consider a density operator @xmath0 in the hilbert space @xmath44 : @xmath45 with @xmath25 and @xmath46 being the computational base for @xmath26 ( @xmath47 ) and the sum is made over all @xmath48 s and @xmath49 s , which run from @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "analogously to the previous calculations , we apply the definition for the partial transposition over the inner sub - system , @xmath52 to see that @xmath53 for numerical calculations , we use @xmath54 to directly relate the matrix elements of @xmath55 and of @xmath0 in the global computational basis .",
    "the subroutine provided to compute the inner partial transposition map is : ` partial_transpose_3(d_{a } , d_{b } , d_{c } , \\rho , t_{b}(\\rho ) ) ` .",
    "now , given any multipartite state space @xmath56 we notice that the partial transposition over the parties @xmath57 and @xmath58 can be composed as follows : @xmath59 with this , the partial transposition over an arbitrary number of subsystems ( with arbitrary finite dimensions ) , can be computed through the composition of the left ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : left ] ) ) , right ( eq . ( [ eq : right ] ) ) , and inner ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : inner ] ) ) partial transpositions described above .",
    "we also provide a subroutine , ` partial_transpose(d , \\rho ,",
    "t_{p}(\\rho ) , nss , di , ssys ) ` , which returns the partial transposition in the general case . regarding the arguments therein , ` nss `",
    "is the number of sub - systems , @xmath60 is the total dimension , ` di ` is a vector containing the dimensions of the subsystems , and ` ssys ` is a vector with components equal to @xmath61 or @xmath50 for those subsystems over which the pt shall or shall not be applied , respectively .",
    "the dimension of ` di ` and ` ssys ` is equal to ` nss ` .      in 1996 , a. peres @xcite made the insightful observation that if a state is separable , i.e. , if it can be cast as @xmath62 with @xmath63 being a probability distribution and @xmath64 being valid density operators for the sub - system @xmath57 , then its pt , @xmath65 is also a valid ( and separable ) state , because @xmath66 are valid density operators ( see sec .",
    "[ transp ] ) and the convex combination of positive semidefinite matrices is also a positive semidefinite matrix @xcite .",
    "so , @xmath67 is a positive semidefinite matrix .",
    "therefore , if the pt of a generic density matrix @xmath0 is negative , then this state has to be entangled .",
    "this fact indicates that the sum of the absolute values of the negative eigenvalues of the pt of a state would be a possible entanglement quantifier .",
    "actually , the entanglement negativity @xcite , @xmath68 is an entanglement function @xcite . in the last equation @xmath69",
    "is the trace norm .",
    "the fortran function ` negativity(d , t_{p}(\\rho ) ) ` returns @xmath70 once provided the pt of @xmath0 and its dimension . in",
    "order to obtain the logarithmic negativity @xcite , @xmath71 , just change the name of the function to ` log_negativity ` .",
    "it was shown later that the peres condition is necessary and sufficient only for systems with dimension up to six @xcite . for larger dimensions",
    ", there may exist entangled states with positive pt @xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "there is no known analytically computable entanglement measure for general states @xcite . in the next section",
    "we ll consider another entanglement function which is not an entanglement quantifier , but which may be a useful analytical tool in several circumstances .",
    "in this section we shall obtain an analytical expression for the hilbert - schmidt entanglement ( hse ) and for the associated closest separable state .",
    "our approach is motivated by ref .",
    "@xcite , but here we do not use lagrange multipliers . with this",
    "our calculations gain in clarity and avoid possible drawbacks of that method @xcite .",
    "let s start by recalling that the hilbert - schmidt ( hs ) norm of a matrix @xmath72 is defined and given by @xmath73 the hse of a state @xmath0 is then defined , using the hs distance , as @xmath74 with the minimization running over all separable states .",
    "since the hs norm is invariant under unitary transformations , i.e. , it is base independent , we can use the computational basis to verify that the hs distance does not change under taking the pt of its arguments : @xmath75 thus , using this equivalence , we can write @xmath76    in the sequence we use once more the invariance under unitaries of the hs norm to see that : @xmath77 where , considering that @xmath78 is an hermitian operator : @xmath79 we assumed that @xmath80 diagonalizes @xmath55 , i.e. , @xmath81 with @xmath82 . besides we defined the , in principle general and possibly entangled , density operator : @xmath83    we remark at this point that",
    "once we find the optimal @xmath84 , let s call it @xmath85 , then , as @xmath86 we have found also the optimal separable state : @xmath87    following with the calculation of the hse , we use eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hse1 ] ) , ( [ eq : ded ] ) , and ( [ eq : zeta ] ) to write @xmath88    from this last expression , we see that @xmath89 is minimized if @xmath84 has no coherences in the eigenbasis of @xmath90 , i.e. , if @xmath91 so , @xmath92    in what follows , it will be useful noticing that , as @xmath84 is a density operator , we have to have @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "in addition to that , it will be important for our calculations seeing that @xmath78 has unit trace : @xmath95    now , let @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 denote the ( real ) positive , negative , and null eigenvalues of @xmath90 ( and of @xmath99 .",
    "the dimension of the corresponding eigenspaces are denoted , respectively , by @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 ; thus @xmath103 .",
    "hence , the unit trace of @xmath78 leads to : @xmath104 which is obtained only if @xmath105 .",
    "thus , the hse in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hse2 ] ) can be written as @xmath106 where @xmath107 are the eigenvalues of @xmath84 with eigenvectors in the positive , negative , and null eigenspaces of @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "of course , we shall minimize @xmath89 if we set @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
    "we also minimize @xmath89 if we set @xmath110 for @xmath111 ( because any @xmath112 would make @xmath113 more negative and hence lead to a greater value of @xmath114 ) .",
    "next , let the positive eigenvalues @xmath96 be arranged in decreasing order and let @xmath115 be defined such that @xmath116 then , considering that s. rana showed in ref .",
    "@xcite that for two - qudit states the eigenvalues of the pt of @xmath0 lie in interval @xmath117 $ ] , we shall minimize @xmath89 if we set @xmath118 with these choices for @xmath119 , we ll have a valid density operator @xmath84 .",
    "thus , substituting these values of @xmath119 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hse3 ] ) , the minimum value for the _ hilbert - schmidt entanglement _ of an arbitrary bipartite density matrix shall be given by : @xmath120    we observe that @xmath89 is written above in terms of ( all ) the negative eigenvalues of @xmath78 and in terms of its @xmath121 smaller positive eigenvalues .",
    "if the state under analysis is separable , then , in addition to the eigenvalues of @xmath78 being positive ( i.e. , @xmath122 ) , we have @xmath123 and therefore @xmath124 , as expected . besides , @xmath125 whenever @xmath126 .    to obtain the _ closest separable state _ ( css ) , we start using the optimal @xmath119 s to write eq .",
    "( [ eq : zeta1 ] ) as follows : @xmath127 thus , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : css_star ] ) and noticing from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ded ] ) that if @xmath128 then @xmath129 , we get @xmath130 so , as @xmath131 is the eigenvector of @xmath78 corresponding to its @xmath132-th positive eigenvalue , we have written @xmath133 in terms of quantities directly related to the pt of @xmath0 . actually , the closest separable state from @xmath0 is seem to be the pt of the mixture of the @xmath115 eigenvectors of @xmath78 corresponding to its @xmath115 greater eigenvalues ; with the weights given by the eigenvalues themselves or by @xmath134 .",
    "the hse , eq .",
    "( [ eq : hse ] ) , and the matrix @xmath135 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : css ] ) , whose pt gives the css , are returned by the subroutine ` entanglement_hs(d , t_{b}(\\rho ) , e_{hs } , css ) ` , with ` css ` being a ` character(1 ) ` variable . if ` css = y ` then , on exit , @xmath135 is returned in @xmath78 .",
    "if ` css = n ` and/or @xmath136 then @xmath135 is not computed and @xmath78 is not modified . as an example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : werner ] we show @xmath70 and @xmath89 calculated for the two- and three - qubit werner states : @xmath137 where @xmath138 $ ] , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 is the @xmath142 identity matrix .    ) .",
    "these states are fully separable for @xmath143 less than @xmath144 and @xmath145 , respectively @xcite . in the two cases",
    "we apply the partial transposition to one of the qubits , the other two are regarded as a ququart . for @xmath146",
    "the positive eigenvalues of its partial transpose are not used and the increasing rate of @xmath89 with @xmath143 is constant .",
    "however , for @xmath147 , because of the changes of @xmath115 with @xmath143 , the number of positive eigenvalues involved in the calculation of @xmath89 also changes , and this leads to the behavior shown in the plot . ]",
    "in this article , we presented a thorough description of the partial transposition ( pt ) map and of related entanglement functions . we produced and described free fortran code to compute all of these functions .",
    "besides , considering two - qudit systems , we obtained an analytical expression for the hilbert - schmidt entanglement ( hse ) and for the associated nearest separable state . in our derivation , we used basically the properties of the pt of a state .",
    "so , in addition to its simplicity and clarity , our approach may be more suitable when compared to the application of lagrange multipliers @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile remarking that the hs distance ( hsd ) is not generally contractive under quantum operations @xcite .",
    "this fact has motivated critiques regarding its use for quantum correlations quantification @xcite . although the hsd can still be a formidable tool for several kinds of inquires @xcite , it would be interesting verifying if the procedure presented here to compute the hse can be extended to other distance measures possessing more of the wanted `` good '' properties . in this direction , it is interesting observing that the @xmath148-norm , which when computed using the basis @xmath149 is given by @xmath150 , was shown to lead to a faithful quantum coherence quantifier ( in contrast to @xmath151 ) @xcite . in fact ,",
    "if @xmath152 is the computational basis : @xmath153 , we can show , in an analogous manner to the verification in sec .",
    "[ sec : hse ] , that @xmath154 however , the lack of unitary invariance of the @xmath148-norm @xcite seems to complicate its application in this scenario ; so we leave the verification of this possibility as an open problem . as an alternative , it would be interesting considering also the @xmath155-norm , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and its quantum extension for application in this context .",
    "it remains though to be investigated if the induced distance measure retains the properties of unitary - invariance , computability , pt - invariance , and contractivity under quantum operations .",
