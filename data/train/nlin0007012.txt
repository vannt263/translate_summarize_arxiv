    "as was shown by the numerical simulation , if we start from an ensemble of gaussian @xmath10 or lorentzian signals and apply the symmetrical truncation and re - gaussianization procedure repeatedly , the output signal converges to @xmath11 noise .",
    "when @xmath205 , in contrast , the symmetrical truncation leads to a power law spectrum with the same exponent @xmath13 .",
    "( a proof for @xmath206 has been given only for the dichotomous transformation.@xcite ) this means that the exponent less than unity can never be reached by the symmetrical truncation as far as we start from the exponent larger than unity . on the other hand , when the asymmetrical amplitude truncation is applied to @xmath3 signal with @xmath13 less than unity , the output psd deviates from the power law .",
    "the correction terms make the slope of the spectrum flatter as @xmath12 increases .",
    "however , as far as the results of the numerical experiments ( @xmath121 in the present paper and @xmath206 in ref .",
    "5 ) are observed , the output psd looks approximately as @xmath3-like with an exponent smaller than that of the input signal .",
    "amplitude truncation may generally occurs in systems composed of threshold elements , for example neural networks .",
    "it also occurs in the flow of packets in internet systems where the overflow of the packets is deleted .",
    "furthermore , measurement or analysis of signals often involves amplitude truncation .",
    "for example , a dichotomous transformation is used to analyze the ( spatial ) long - range correlation in dna.@xcite if a lorentzian or @xmath10 noise is superposed on the original signal , filtering with such a truncation may easily leads to the observation of a @xmath3 noise .    throughout the present paper",
    ", we have assumed that the time scale of the system is long enough so that the original data exhibits the power law spectrum in a wide range of frequencies . as mentioned already , to derive an extremely long time scale from any realistic model",
    "is a difficult problem .",
    "once a long time scale has been assumed , however , the present study suggests a possible mechanism to generate @xmath3 noises with the exponent smaller than that of the original signal .",
