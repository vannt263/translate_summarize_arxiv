    "case  1 : @xmath191 . in this case , any line through 3 of the base points would have at least 6 intersections , counted with multiplicity , with any quintic in @xmath188 , hence it would be a fixed component , which is not possible ; it follows that no three base points are collinear .",
    "moreover , no base points is infinitely near to another , because this would give rise to the blow down of a -2-curve which would give a singular point on the surface @xmath15 , in contrast to the assumption that @xmath15 is nonsingular .",
    "hence @xmath80 are double points of @xmath188 , and they are in generic position .",
    "case  2 : @xmath192 .",
    "then the parametrization map @xmath193 is the product of the blowup at the 6 base points and some birational regular map blowing down the fundamental curves . because @xmath15 is @xmath2-isomorphic to the blowup of @xmath16 at 4 points , the number of fundamental curves is 2 .",
    "the fundamental curves are the curves which have no moving intersection points with the curves in @xmath188 , and these are the two lines @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "let @xmath51 be the image of the fundamental curve @xmath194 .",

    "in this section , we give an algorithm for deciding whether two given anticanonically embedded del pezzo surfaces @xmath198 and @xmath199 of degree  5 are isomorphic over @xmath1 .",
    "the section makes use of galois cohomology and @xmath1-twists : an approach which gives an alternative ( non - constructive ) proof of the parametrizability of degree 5 del pezzo surfaces ( see @xcite ) . through cohomology",
    ", we see that the isomorphism class over @xmath1 is determined by the action of galois on the graph of exceptional lines and we explain how to choose the seed in the construction in order to obtain any prescribed isomorphism class .",

    "the appendix to section 3.1 of @xcite gives a classification of these twists .",
    "however , the description there is rather abstract : they are given as quotients of the set of stable points of a grassmannian by a twisted torus .",

    "to show surjectivity , it suffices to prove that @xmath212 is transitive on lines and that its stabiliser of any particular line is @xmath216 .",
    "if we blow down any exceptional line @xmath86 , we get a non - degenerate degree 6 del pezzo @xmath198 whose exceptional lines are the images of exceptional lines of @xmath15 that do nt intersect @xmath86 .",
    "any automorphism of @xmath198 that fixes the image point @xmath143 of @xmath86 will lift to an automorphism of @xmath15 ( that fixes @xmath86 ) . considering the configuration @xmath209",
    ", it is then easy to see that it suffices to prove that the automorphisms of @xmath198 that preserve a point @xmath143 not on an exceptional line induce the full group of graph automorphisms of its exceptional lines .",
    "this is true because the automorphism group of @xmath198 is a split extension of @xmath217 by a 1-dimensional torus @xmath137 where @xmath137 acts transitively on the complement of the exceptional lines and is precisely the subgroup fixing all six of these .",
