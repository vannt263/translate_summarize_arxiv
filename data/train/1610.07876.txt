    "consider a solenoid of length @xmath0 and arbitrary cross section of area @xmath1 .",
    "every high school and beginning undergraduate student is taught that an infinitely long ideal solenoid produces uniform magnetic field within the core of the solenoid and that the field outside the solenoid vanishes .",
    "the exact field outside the infinite solenoid has been extensively studied in literature@xcite .",
    "the exact solution for the finite solenoid has also been studied , notably in an article from 1960.@xcite informally , the two ends of the long solenoid behave like two magnetic poles , each of which produce fields that fall off with the inverse square of distance , and thus the fields outside are small when the length of the solenoid is increased , keeping the current fixed .",
    "typical introductory texts use symmetry arguments to prove at first that the fields have to be parallel to the axis , and then use ampere s law to find the magnetic field outside and inside the solenoid.@xcite@xcite .    this standard textbook treatment , while correct ,",
    "does not explain how the fields due to each individual coil of the solenoid add up to produce no net field at any point outside the solenoid , in the limit of the solenoid length going to infinity .",
    "there are some introductory texts that try to address this by saying the density of field lines outside the solenoid decreases as the length of the solenoid is increased @xcite , which is not based on any quantitative analysis .",
    "farley and price@xcite argue that the magnetic field just outside the finite solenoid is roughly constant in the central region ; and only then they are able to use the reciprocity theorem of mutual inductance in an elegant way , to estimate the magnetic field outside the finite solenoid , on the median plane .    .",
    "]    we first provide an elementary heuristic argument in section ii , explaining why the field anywhere outside the solenoid has to become vanishingly small , as the length of the solenoid is increased .",
    "the key point to note is , the field at any point @xmath2 outside the solenoid due to coils closer to it , and the field at the same point due to coils farther away from it , have opposite direction along the axis , as illustrated in fig 2 . to corroborate the arguments of section",
    "ii , we show a calculation for the magnetic field outside the solenoid , at radial distances @xmath3 , in section iii .",
    "our calculation directly shows that the magnetic field strength at distances much greater than the solenoid radial dimension is roughly constant , and we do not need to a priori argue it before being able to calculate it quantitatively , as in the case of the calculation in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is indeed surprising that our simple and easily motivated analysis does not appear anywhere in the literature .",
    "one caveat for the usual textbook treatment is that for any actual solenoid , there has to be a component of current flowing along the surface of the solenoid , in the axial direction . because of this , there is a feeble magnetic field in the azimuthal direction surrounding the solenoid.@xcite,@xcite for the purposes of this letter , we neglect this tiny field ; we treat the solenoid as a stack of tightly packed uniform cross - section identical coils carrying the same current .",
    ": ( i ) due to coils farther away from @xmath2 on the left ; and ( ii ) due to coils closer to @xmath2 on the right.@xcite ]    the field lines due to an individual circular current carrying coil are shown in fig 1 .",
    "both points @xmath4 and @xmath5 are at the same radial distance from the axis of the coil , with @xmath5 being vertically farther away from the coil than @xmath4 .",
    "the z - component of the magnetic field at the point @xmath4 is negative , while that at the point @xmath5 is positive .",
    "we draw a circular coil for simplicity , but our arguments hold for any arbitrary solenoid cross section .",
    "consider any arbitrary point p outside the solenoid and left of it , where we are to find the magnetic field .",
    "this point might be arbitrarily close to , or very far away from the solenoid ; the subsequent argument remains unchanged.the current in each of the coils of the solenoid flows counter clockwise when viewed from the top .",
    "the perpendicular to the axis , passing through the point p , touches the axis at the point p , as shown in fig 2 .",
    "the line pp and the axis of the solenoid determine the plane under consideration .",
    "consider first the individual loops of the solenoid far from the point p. as shown in figure 2(i ) , a loop far below p(the loop @xmath6 in fig .",
    "2 ) produces the field @xmath7 at p. similarly , a symmetrically placed loop far above p ( the loop @xmath8 in fig .",
    "2 ) produces the field @xmath9 at @xmath2 .",
    "the resultant of these two fields is @xmath10 that points up along the axis , i.e. along the direction of flow of current .",
    "the radial component of this combined field at @xmath2 cancels out due to symmetry .",
    "the distance of these coils from the point p is large , and their individual contributions fall of as the inverse cube of this distance ; but the number of loops producing this field up along the axis extends to infinity for an infinite solenoid ( both above and below p ) , and so we have a significant contribution .    we are left to deal with the loops close to @xmath11 .",
    "the field lines from these loops , that touch upon @xmath2 , produce the fields @xmath12(due to the coil @xmath13 ) and @xmath14(due to the coil @xmath15 ) , so that the resultant is the field @xmath16 .",
    "the contributions due to each of the two loops @xmath17 is fairly large , while the number of such loops producing the fields in the downward direction are fairly small .    in the regime",
    "where @xmath3 , we show in the next section that we get the downward field at @xmath2 , only for loops till a distance @xmath18 on either side of p along the axis .",
    "for a finite solenoid of small length , we only have significant contributions from the loops producing the downward field .",
    "there wo nt be enough loops far away from the point p that produces the upward field , because the solenoid is finite .",
    "for the infinite solenoid , we end up having a negligible field because these two effects counteract each other well .    if our observation point is far away , the number of loops producing the downward field increases while the number of loops producing the upward field still extends to infinity for the infinite solenoid .",
    "the net effect remains the same .",
    "for the finite solenoid , the two length scales of the problem are the radial dimension of the cross section @xmath19 and the length @xmath0 of the solenoid . at distances",
    "much larger than @xmath0 , the entire solenoid itself is treated as a point magnetic dipole , as noted in ref @xcite . in our case , @xmath20 . even at radial distances comparable to @xmath0 but much larger than @xmath19",
    ", we can treat each individual current loop as a point dipole , and add up the field due to each current loop .",
    "the essential feature of the argument of the previous section shows up in the calculation ; the axial component of the field due to a particular current loop switches sign after we move sufficiently far away from it along the z - direction .",
    "the analysis in this section is similar to that required for the configuration presented in problem 5.61 in griffiths s introduction to electrodynamics.@xcite    the solenoid has @xmath21 turns per unit length . for a loop of infinitesimal thickness @xmath22 along the axis",
    ", there is a current @xmath23 through this loop.the magnetic moment of this loop is @xmath24 .",
    "the magnetic field of this point dipole is :    @xmath25    here @xmath26 is the vector to the point @xmath2 from the coil element , as shown in fig .",
    "the solenoid lies along the z - axis , and stretches from @xmath27 to @xmath28 .",
    "the radial component of the field at the point @xmath2 due to the coil element at @xmath29 is :    @xmath30    the radial component of the field vanishes for an infinite solenoid due to symmetry , as can be seen by integrating the above equation for all values of @xmath29 from @xmath31 to @xmath32 . even for the finite solenoid ,",
    "this component is small , as can be argued from the methods of ref @xcite .",
    "we henceforth ignore this radial component .    the axial field at point @xmath2 due to the coil element at @xmath29 is given by :    @xmath33    whenever @xmath34 the field points in the negative @xmath35 direction , and switches sign for a greater vertical separation , as argued in section ii .",
