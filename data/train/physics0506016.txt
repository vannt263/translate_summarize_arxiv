    "linear electron - positron colliders will be the privileged tool for studying physics in the tev energy region . to overcome the decrease of the @xmath2 annihilation cross section , very large currents both in @xmath3 and in @xmath4 will be needed .",
    "the conventional positron source consists in an amorphous target of heavy metal , hit by a primary electron beam .",
    "photons , which are produced by bremsstrahlung , are converted in the same target into @xmath2 pairs resulting in an electromagnetic shower .",
    "the thickness of the target is chosen to maximize the number of the positrons in the energy and angular domain of acceptance of the downstream matching system installed before the damping ring .",
    "such positrons represent only a small fraction of all charged particles created in the target .",
    "this is due to their wide energy and angular spread , which comes from the photon emission and pair production processes and , above all , from multiple scattering of charged particles .",
    "therefore a very intense primary electron beam is needed to achieve the desired positron beam current .    in the high energy region , the basic processes involved in the shower development",
    "are considerably enhanced in the oriented crystals , as compared with corresponding amorphous media .",
    "the most pronounced effects take place at the orientation where the electrons are incident along the major axes of the crystal . at such orientation ,",
    "the incident electrons are exposed to the highest mean electric field provided by the atomic rows @xcite .",
    "the enhancement depends on the particle energy and the crystal orientation ( see @xcite for further details concerning electromagnetic processes in crystals ) .",
    "therefore , the replacement of the conventional positron target by a crystal is expected to improve the efficiency of the positron source .    when the energy increases , the coherent ( crystal ) effects become noticeable first in radiation , while their contribution to the pair production is still negligible .",
    "for example , the radiation intensity caused by the electric field of the @xmath5-axis of a tungsten crystal exceeds that of the conventional bremsstrahlung starting with electron energies @xmath6 1 gev @xcite .",
    "for the same crystal , the coherent contribution to the pair production starts to exceed that of the standard ( bethe - heitler ) mechanism at photon energies @xmath7 22 gev . for lighter crystals ,",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath8 turns out to be several times larger than for tungsten .",
    "an incident electron energy of several gev is foreseen for an efficient positron source . then the pair production process proceeds in a crystal as in the corresponding amorphous medium .",
    "the enhancement of radiation from initial electrons is thereby the main crystal effect in the energy region of interest . according to theoretical estimates ( see ,",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) , the effective radiation length @xmath9 in a tungsten crystal becomes smaller than the conventional radiation length by the factor of 4.2 at @xmath10 4 gev and by the factor of 5.7 at @xmath10 8 gev . alongside with the high power ,",
    "the radiation at axial alignment is characterized by the softness of its spectrum .",
    "this leads to further increase in the number of emitted photons and in the number of produced positrons as compared with the amorphous target .",
    "the description of the development of the electron - photon showers in an axially aligned crystal was elaborated in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . according to these papers",
    "( see also fig .  1 in @xcite ) , the electron energy is converted in a crystal target into photons over a thickness of several @xmath9 .",
    "then at the depth @xmath11 most of the particles , including the initial electrons , are sufficiently soft to reduce the coherent contribution to the radiation to a level below the incoherent one .",
    "therefore , the further development of the shower proceeds more or less in the same way for the crystal or amorphous type of the remaining part of a target .",
    "so , we come to the idea of a compound target , which consists of a crystal part of thickness about @xmath12 followed by an amorphous one @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the crystal part of a target serves as a radiator , and secondary charged particles are still not so numerous at this stage of the shower development .",
    "therefore , only a small portion of the total energy loss is deposited in this part of the target , which considerably reduces the danger of its overheating .    in the construction of an intense positron source ,",
    "the thermal issues are rather important . a substantial part ( for example , more than 30 % in the jlc project  @xcite ) of the primary beam power is dissipated and transformed into heat inside the target , mainly due to the ionization energy losses by the charged particles of the shower . as already observed in the slac linear collider ( slc ) target ,",
    "this causes serious thermal problems , which makes the actual limitation to the beam current . for crystals , where the ionization energy losses are practically not modified",
    "as compared with amorphous media , the thermal issues were considered in @xcite , @xcite and , in detail , in @xcite .",
    "it was found that , in the energy range under consideration , the positron yield at the optimal target thickness may be larger in a crystal case only by several percent .",
    "however , the amount of the energy deposition in a crystal turns out to be considerably lower ( by a factor 2 for the jlc project , for instance ) than in an amorphous target providing the same positron yield , while the peak energy deposition density ( pedd ) is approximately of the same magnitude in both cases .",
    "recently the positron production in axially aligned single crystals was studied in two series of experiments performed at cern @xcite and kek @xcite . in both cases , the incident electron beam of different energies , up to 10  gev ,",
    "was aligned with the @xmath13-axis of a tungsten crystal , which sometimes served as a crystal part of the compound target containing an additional amorphous tungsten part .",
    "basing on the approach developed in @xcite and @xcite , theoretical estimations were obtained in @xcite , which display a rather good agreement with the experimental results of @xcite , where only the positrons outgoing in the forward direction ( i.e. , with a vanishing transverse momentum ) were registered for a discrete set of their longitudinal momentum values . however , to obtain a full description of the crystal - assisted positron source , the positron distribution in the whole momentum space , longitudinal and transverse , should be measured .",
    "this is done in the present experimental studies , where the energy and angular distributions of the positrons are obtained in a rather wide energy range ( up to 150 mev ) and angular domain ( up to 30 degrees ) .",
    "the experiment was installed on the x5 transfer line of the sps west hall at cern .",
    "it used tertiary electron beams having energies between 5 and 40 gev . after passing through trigger counters and profile monitors ( delay chambers )",
    "the electrons impinge on the target .",
    "photons and @xmath2 pairs are generated in this target .",
    "they go mainly in the forward direction and travel across the magnetic spectrometer made of a magnet ( mbps ) , with vertical magnetic field , inside which the drift chamber is placed . the drift chamber is completed by two positron counters , one on the wall away from the beam , one on the back wall ( fig .",
    "[ set - up ] ) .",
    "the charged particles coming out from the drift chamber close to the forward direction are swept by a second magnet ( mbpl ) while the forward photons reach the photon detector made of a preshower and a calorimeter .",
    "the sps beam is made of 3.2 ( resp .",
    "5.2 ) second duration pulses with a 14.4 ( resp .",
    "16.8 ) second period for the 2000 ( resp .",
    "2001 ) summer runs .",
    "each pulse contains @xmath14 electrons representing 99  % of the particles .",
    "this intensity value was currently reached at 6 and 10 gev .",
    "the channeling condition requires that the incident electron angle on the target be smaller than the lindhard critical angle @xcite ; this angle is of 0.45 mrad at 10 gev and for the @xmath0 orientation of the tungsten crystal . taking into account the persistence of crystal effects at angles larger than the critical angle , the acceptance angle for the trigger was chosen equal to 0.75 mrad .",
    "this selects about 1% of the incident electrons .",
    "a trigger system made of scintillation counters , with a restricted angular aperture of 0.75 mrad , was installed upstream of the target .",
    "the trigger selection was improved off line by the informations provided by a proportional delay chamber .",
    "this delay chamber with horizontal and vertical grids , put at short distance from the target , provided informations on the lateral distributions of the incident electron beam .",
    "these informations served for beam control during the run and , as said above , were also used in the selection criteria . on fig .",
    "[ delay ] we represent the lateral distributions of the electron beam .",
    "the crystal - assisted positron source can be an all - crystal target . however , coherent effects are mostly important at the beginning of the shower . in the following steps of the shower",
    "the particles have lower energies , larger angles and the crystalline effects are not important .",
    "therefore , a compound target , made of a crystal as a primary radiator generating a large amount of photons and an amorphous disk where the photons are converted into @xmath2 pairs , has nearly the same advantages . in the experiment ,",
    "four kinds of targets have been installed on a 0.001 degree precision goniometer :    * a 4 mm thick crystal , * a 8 mm thick crystal , * a compound target made of 4 mm crystal followed by a 4 mm thick amorphous disk , * an amorphous disk 20 mm thick ; this target was used in order to check the reconstruction efficiency with a number of positrons comparable to the one produced in a 8 mm thick aligned crystal .",
    "mosaic spreads of the crystals ( root mean square disorientation angle of the crystalline domains ) is measured by gamma - diffractometry at the max - planck institute in stuttgart- are slightly less than 0.5 mrad .",
    "the targets alignment was done using the data from the positron counters and from the photon preshower .",
    "the latter gives a signal proportional to the number of photons , which is maximum on axis position , as can be seen on the rocking curves ( fig .",
    "[ scan ] ) .",
    "the signal in the preshower is formed mainly by the two processes : @xmath15 conversion with the yield of two minimal ionizing particles ( mip ) per photon and compton scattering with the yield of one mip per photon .",
    "the relative contributions of the processes depend on the emitted @xmath15 spectrum .",
    "the positron detector consists in the drift chamber ( dc ) with hexagonal cells and positron scintillation counters .",
    "the dc is a quasi - plane detector with its largest dimensions in the horizontal plane and the smallest one , in the vertical plane .",
    "it presents two parts :    * the first part ( dc1 ) , with a cell radius of 0.9 cm , is located mainly outside the magnetic field of the spectrometer .",
    "it allows the measurement of the horizontal exit angle , @xmath16 of the positrons .",
    "* the second one ( dc2 ) , with a cell radius of 1.6 cm , is immersed in the magnetic field .",
    "it allows the measurement of the horizontal positron ( electron ) momentum .",
    "two values of the magnetic field are used : 1 and 4 kilogauss ( kg ) , in order to investigate the whole energy region of interest , from 5 to 150 mev .    in the drift chamber the wires are parallel to the magnetic field ( vertical ) .",
    "the available space in the bending magnet ( mbps ) restricts the vertical size of the chamber and therefore , the length of the wires ( 6 cm ) . with such short length",
    ", the border effect is significant .",
    "the drift chamber has metallic walls therefore these border effects lead to an increase of the gas amplification . in order to use the central part of the wires ,",
    "two positron counters with a vertical size of 3 cm were used . that sets the vertical acceptance to @xmath17 degree for a distance target ",
    "counter of about 1 meter .",
    "the first counter is placed on the lateral side of the chamber and the other one on the back side .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ set - up ] ) .",
    "low energy positrons are more likely bent toward the side positron counter . strictly speaking",
    ", for a many - track event , these counters told only that at least one track was hitting the central part of the wires but did not tell which one .",
    "the signal provided by the side counter gives a rather good indication on the low - energy positron yield .",
    "the signal wires in the drift chamber are made of gold - plated tungsten and the field wires of titanium .",
    "the drift chamber has 21 layers .",
    "the maximum horizontal angle being accepted is 30 degrees .",
    "the limited vertical size sets the overall acceptance to 6 % of @xmath18 solid angle . in order to reduce the multiple scattering for low - energy positrons the drift chamber is filled with an helium - based mixture he ( 90 % ) + ch@xmath19 ( 10 % ) .",
    "the achieved coordinate resolution is about 500 micrometers .",
    "this leads to an angular resolution of 0.25 degree and a typical energy resolution of 0.6 mev for both values of the magnetic field .",
    "standard electronics associated to drift chambers is used .",
    "the data acquisition software is developed using kmax system under windows nt environment .",
    "the collected data is saved on a hard disk .",
    "the total amount of the raw data is approximately 3 gb .      the photon multiplicity is rather high : about 200 photons / event for a 8 mm thick crystal target oriented along its @xmath13 axis and 10 gev initial electron energy .",
    "we measure only the average photon multiplicity and the total radiated energy , contained in a forward cone with maximum half angle of 4 mrad . for this goal",
    "the photon detector is made of :    * a preshower made of a copper disk ( @xmath20 thick ) , followed by a scintillator .",
    "two sizes of copper disks ( 3 and 6 cm in diameter , corresponding to a semi - angle aperture of 1.5 and 3 mrad respectively ) have been used successively to look at the number of photons and at their angular distribution .",
    "the preshower gives information on the average photon multiplicity .",
    "as the number of photons varies more sharply than the radiated energy with respect to the crystal orientation , the preshower signal is used for the crystal alignment . * a `` spaghetti '' calorimeter with thin scintillation fibers , giving the amount of radiated energy ( see  @xcite ) .",

    "the track reconstruction was done with the histogram method , modified to assign 3 parameters to each track . to avoid difficulties coming from the high rate of occupancy and complications from the non - uniform magnetic field in the first part of the drift chamber ,",
    "the reconstructed trajectory was based on the informations from the second part of the chamber .",
    "the extrapolation back to the target has been operated using the measured values of the field .",
    "the trajectory of an electron or positron , projected on the horizontal plane , was parametrised as a circle with the following parameters : @xmath21 is the radius of the circle ; @xmath22 are the coordinates of the circle center .",

    "a good equivalence between the results for 8 mm crystal and the compound target allows the use of the latter instead of the all - crystal , for thermal reasons . * a large number of soft positrons due to the materialization of soft photons .",
    "the channeling and coherent bremsstrahlung processes provide softer photons than classical bremsstrahlung .",
    "so an enhanced number of soft positrons due to the materialization of these soft photons is available .",
    "the practical interest is a better matching with known energy acceptances of currently used matching systems . * a good agreement between simulations and experiment for photons and positrons .",
    "this result validates the simulations based on crystal processes , permitting reliable simulations with different incident energies and crystal types ( material , orientation , thickness ) . that is essential to optimize this kind of source .",
    "+ we may add an additive argument for the use of crystal targets , due to investigations on the deposited energy in these targets @xcite .",
    "it results from these calculations that even if the pedd in crystal and amorphous targets giving the same yield is practically the same , the total deposited energy is much less in the crystal case .",
    "this set of arguments make this kind of positron source attractive .",
    "it justifies also the continuous interest in investigating such sources as it can be verified presently at kek @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the authors are indebted to professors j.lefrancois , f.richard , a.skrinsky for their appreciable support .",
    "we are grateful for the technical support in binp , lal and ipnl ."
