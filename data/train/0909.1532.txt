    "the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays ( hecrs ) is one of the biggest mysteries in astrophysics .",
    "although theoretical candidates of hecr sources have been proposed ( see @xcite for reviews ) , hecr sources have not been successfully identified .",
    "a difficulty to identify hecr sources is the existence of galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) and intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) .",
    "since hecrs are charged , these magnetic fields deflect the trajectories of hecrs from their sources to the earth , i.e. , the arrival directions of hecrs are shifted from the positions of their sources .    recent progress to construct hecr observatories with larger effective area",
    "has enabled us to accumulate a number of hecr events and to draw anisotropy in the arrival distribution of hecrs @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy includes information on the positions of their sources and intervening magnetic fields from the sources to the earth .",
    "also , the pierre auger observatory ( pao ) found the correlation between the arrival directions of 27 hecr events above @xmath13 ev and the positions of extragalactic astrophysical objects in local universe within @xmath14 with angular scale of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "several authors have also analyzed the pao events .",
    "@xcite showed significant correlation of the pao events with hard x - ray selected active galactic nuclei ( agns ) by using the 2 dimensional generalization of kolmogorov - smilnov test .",
    "generally , the correlation between the pao events and galaxies , which are a representative of matter distribution in local universe , has been shown @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated the typical angular scale of positive correlation between hecrs and galaxy distribution and bounded the deflection angles of hecrs in local universe .",
    "all these works indicate that the origin of hecrs is extragalactic objects distributed with being comparable to galaxies . furthermore ,",
    "in an optimistic view , we can interpret these results as the evidence that intervening magnetic fields are not so strong that the arrival directions of hecrs lose information on the positions of their sources as predicted by @xcite and @xcite ( but see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for strong igmf ) .",
    "this interpretation implies that a more number of hecr events can unveil the positions of their sources as strong event clusters within small angular scale , as demonstrated by @xcite without magnetic field .",
    "@xcite showed that such a signal is also predicted for the highest energy protons ( heps ) even considering a structured igmf model , which reflects the matter distribution of local universe actually observed .",
    "we can regard these works as predictions of the pao result .",
    "however , it is still under debate that astrophysical objects which correlate with the pao events are really hecr sources because these objects have weaker activity than theoretically predicted source candidates @xcite .",
    "however , a recent pao result showed that the significance of the correlation reported in @xcite decreased , though the correlation is still significant at more than 2@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the high resolution fly s eye ( hires ) reported that their is no correlation between hires events and extragalactic objects based on a similar analysis to the analysis of the pao @xcite .",
    "thus , we should reconsider the correlation between hecrs and their sources , and therefore the effect of intervening magnetic fields . the large deflection angles of hecrs could weaken the correlation .",
    "the possibilities that the deflection of hecr trajectories is larger than one expected are ( i ) gmf affects the deflections significantly ( ii ) the main composition of the hecrs is heavier than protons ( iii ) the igmf model used in @xcite was optimistic , i.e. , the deflection of heps in this igmf model is smaller than that in the real universe . in this study , we focus on the possibility ( i ) assuming that the composition of hecrs are purely protons and igmf subdominantly affects the deflections of heps .",
    "the other possibilities will be discussed in  [ conclusion ] .",
    "cosmic rays arriving at the earth are inevitably affected by gmf . this importance has driven us to consider the propagation of hecrs in the galactic space @xcite .",
    "many of these works have mainly investigated the propagation of hecrs itself in detail .",
    "based on the results of these studies , the deflection angles of the trajectories of heps are highly dependent on their arrival directions reflecting the structure of gmf and can be less than @xmath17 at the highest energy ( @xmath18 ev ) except in the direction of the galactic center .",
    "the angular dependence of the deflection of heps distorts the apertures of hecr detectors to extragalactic space , so - called magnetic lensing effect @xcite .",
    "some of them guessed hecr sources using experimental data and hecr trajectories calculated in gmf models .",
    "@xcite studied the possibility to reconstruct the positions of hecr sources and several properties of intervening magnetic field from detected hecrs . @xcite and",
    "@xcite calculated the arrival distribution of hecrs assuming source models , and then analyzed the arrival distribution .",
    "however , they mainly investigated the auto - correlation of hecrs . the cross - correlation between hecrs and their sources",
    "was hardly considered .    in this study",
    ", we investigate the cross - correlation between the arrival directions of heps and the positions of their sources containing the effect of gmf . for this purpose",
    ", we simulate the arrival distribution of protons above @xmath0 ev taking their propagation in magnetized galactic space into account .",
    "since the positions of sources of simulated heps are known in simulations , we can calculate cross - correlation functions between hecrs and their sources .",
    "the modelling of gmf is still controversial , as different models of gmf have been adopted in the previous studies introduced above .",
    "thus , we also examine the dependence of predicted correlation signals on gmf models .",
    "this paper is laid out as follows :  [ calculation ] is devoted to explain gmf models , a hep source model , the calculation method of the arrival distribution of heps , and a statistical quantity to use our correlation analysis .  [ results ] is dedicated to giving calculation results .",
    "first of all , we investigate the effect of gmf to the propagation trajectories of heps in  [ def ] .",
    "then , we calculate the cross - correlation between the arrival directions of simulated heps and their nearby sources , and examine the angular scale at which positive correlation is predicted in  [ ccor_sources ] . in  [ ccor_best ] , we estimate the angular distance within which positive correlation signals are maximized and its significance . finally , we summarize results obtained in  [ results ] and briefly discuss the possible effect of igmf and heavy - nuclei dominated composition .",
    "gmf can be divided into 3 components ; a spiral component following the optical spiral arm of the galaxy , a vertical component , and a turbulent component .",
    "these components of gmf are modelled as follows .",
    "the spiral component could be well described by axisymmetric ( as ) or bisymmetric ( bs ) field models .",
    "bs models have several field reversals , while as models do not .",
    "although a field reversal at @xmath19 kpc inside from the solar system is well established , the existence of the other field reversals predicted by bs models , i.e. , which is a better modelling , is still controversial . recognizing this uncertainty , we adopt both bs and as models in this study and discuss the dependence of the positional correlation between hecrs and their sources on gmf models .",
    "we use the parametrization of both gmf models by @xcite , described below .",
    "the radial and azimuthal components of a spiral magnetic field in the galactic plane are given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the galactocentric distance and azimuthal angle around the galactic center , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath22 is defined as increasing clockwise and @xmath23 corresponds to the direction of the galactic center .",
    "@xmath24 is the pitch angle of the spiral field in the neighborhood of the solar system , set to @xmath25 .",
    "the field strength at a point @xmath26 in the galactic plane is written as @xmath27 here @xmath28 and @xmath29 kpc is the galactocentric distance of the location with maximum field strength at @xmath23 , which can be expressed as @xmath30 $ ] , where @xmath31 kpc is the distance of the solar system from the galactic center and @xmath32 kpc is the distance to the nearest field reversal from the solar system in the bs model .",

    "the field is highly uncertain and therefore assumed to be constant and equal to its value at @xmath39 kpc .",
    "the spiral field is assumed to be zero for @xmath40 kpc .    for the spiral halo field",
    ", we adopt an exponential decreasing model with two scale heights @xcite , @xmath41 where the factor @xmath42 makes the field continuous on @xmath43 .",
    "the parity is represented as @xmath44 the combination between the 2 spiral structures and the parity produces 4 different spiral gmf models .",
    "there is little observational evidence of the vertical component of gmf .",
    "near the solar system , a vertical component of magnetic field with strength of 0.2 - 0.3 @xmath45 g , which is directed toward the north galactic pole , is observed @xcite .",
    "also , a lot of nonthermal gaseous filaments perpendicular to the galactic plane with tens of @xmath45 g to mg have been discovered near the galactic center @xcite .",
    "little information allows us to construct the realistic model of the vertical component of gmf .",
    "@xcite assumed uniform magnetic field with @xmath43-direction which is a possible effect of the existence of galactic wind . here , we adopt a dipole field as a vertical component of gmf following @xcite .",
    "a dipole field is described as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the zenith angle and the azimuthal angle in spherical coordinates centered at the galactic center , respectively .",
    "@xmath49 g kpc@xmath50 is the magnetic moment of the galactic dipole , which is normalized at 0.3@xmath45 g in the vicinity of the solar system . theoretically , a dipole field can be predicted by the so - called a0 mode in the dynamo theory @xcite . since the a0 mode predicts the a - type parity of a spiral component , it is non - trivial that gmf models with s - type parity have a dipole component naturally .",
    "note that there is no clear observational evidence of a dipole magnetic field .",
    "gmf has also a significant turbulent component , but its field strength , @xmath51 , has large uncertainty .",
    "several observations have estimated as @xmath52(0.5 - 2 ) @xmath53 @xcite , where @xmath53 is the strength of the regular component of gmf . in this study , we assume @xmath54 and @xmath53 is the sum of the strength of the spiral component and the strength of the dipole component . the coherent length of the turbulent component , @xmath55 , has been thought to be typically @xmath56 pc @xcite .",
    "we assume a turbulent magnetic field with the kolmogorov power spectrum with @xmath57 pc .",
    "since this @xmath55 is much smaller than the larmor radius of heps the turbulent component does not significantly affect the propagation of heps with @xmath18 ev @xcite .",
    "however , this component will be important for the propagation of heavy nuclei in the galactic space due to their large charges .    in this study",
    ", we adopt a turbulent igmf model constructed in @xcite .",
    "we cover galactic space with cubes of side @xmath55 and assume that turbulent magnetic field in each cube is represented as a gaussian random field with zero mean and a power - low spectrum @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a numerical cutoff scale .",
    "physically , one expects @xmath60 , but we set @xmath61 to save the cpu time .",
    "we adopt @xmath62 , which corresponds to the kolmogorov power spectrum .",
    "+      the pao data implies that hecr sources are distributed to be comparable with matter ( or galaxy ) distribution in local universe @xcite . following this result",
    ", we consider hep source model in which sources are distributed following galaxy distribution actually observed @xcite .",
    "this model is summarized as below .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "this source model is based on the infrared astronomical satellite point source redshift survey ( iras pscz ) catalog of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the iras pscz catalog is appropriate to construct the model of hep sources distributed with being comparable to galaxy distribution because this galaxy catalog is a flux - limited , i.e. , uniform , catalog of galaxies with very large sky coverage ( @xmath63 84% on the whole sky ) .",
    "this catalog includes 2 selection effects : one is the effect of undetected dark galaxies with the flux below the flux - limit ( 0.6 jy ) , and the other is @xmath64 of unobserved area which mainly corresponds to the sky near the galactic plane .",
    "we correct these selection effects by using a luminosity function of the iras galaxies @xcite .",
    "the former effect can be corrected by adding virtual galaxies with the flux less than the flux - limit in the vicinity of the original iras galaxies not to spoil the original structured galaxy distribution . for the latter effect",
    ", we simply assume that galaxies are distributed isotropically in the unobserved area .",
    "these corrections allow us to construct ( a model of ) a complete galaxy catalog .",
    "we adopt this corrected galaxy catalog only within 200 mpc to make hecr source distribution because the number of original galaxies outside 200 mpc is too small to make source distribution reflecting matter distribution in the universe .",
    "it is assumed that galaxies are isotropically distributed outside 200 mpc up to 1 gpc .",
    "the subsets of this corrected galaxy catalog are regarded as hep source distributions , i.e. , we randomly select galaxies from this corrected catalog according to a given number density of hep sources , @xmath4 , and then the selected galaxies are regarded as hep sources .",
    "the distribution of hep sources traces the distribution of the original iras galaxies within 200 mpc .",
    "hep sources outside 200 mpc are distributed isotropically by definition , but these isotropic sources hardly contribute to the total flux of heps because more than 90% of heps above @xmath0 ev detected at the earth is generated within 200 mpc .    for the physical properties of hep sources",
    ", we assume that all the sources emit heps persistently with the same power and with a power - law spectrum of @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the energy of heps .",
    "this spectral index can well reproduce the observed spectrum of hecrs above @xmath67 ev .",
    "we consider 2 number densities of hep sources , @xmath11 and @xmath68 mpc@xmath6 . @xmath69 mpc@xmath6 can best reproduce anisotropy in the arrival distribution of hecrs detected by the pao @xcite , while @xmath68 mpc@xmath6 is the number density to reproduce the agasa anisotropy well @xcite .",
    "when selecting hep sources from the corrected galaxy catalog , we do not consider any specific condition , e.g. , selecting only agns and so on .",
    "thus , we generate 500 source distributions for @xmath11 mpc@xmath6 and @xmath70 mpc@xmath6 , and discuss the cross - correlation between heps and their sources statistically .      in order to simulate the arrival distribution of heps for a given source distribution ,",
    "we adopt a calculation method developed by @xcite . when a cosmic ray is injected into magnetized universe from its source , whether this cosmic ray can reach the earth or not can not be known until its trajectory is actually calculated because of the existence of magnetic field .",
    "such a cosmic ray does not arrive at the earth in many case .",
    "this requires the injection of many particles and the calculation of their trajectories to simulate the arrival distribution of hecrs at the earth .",
    "it is time - wasting to calculate the trajectories of hecrs which can not reach the earth .",
    "our method solved this problem by considering only the trajectories of heps reaching the earth , and enables us to calculate the arrival distribution of protons within reasonable cpu time .    in this method , the trajectories of protons are calculated by the backtracking method .",
    "the trajectory of an oppositely - charged proton ejected from the earth can regarded as that of a proton coming from extragalactic space .",
    "many oppositely - charged protons are ejected from the earth isotropically , and their trajectories in the galactic space are calculated .",
    "a decade of the energy of heps is divided into 10 bins in logarithmic scale .",
    "125,000 particles are emitted from the earth per energy bin in this study .",
    "we consider heps with the energy from @xmath67 ev to @xmath71 ev at the earth .",
    "once the ejected particles escape from the galactic space , they propagate straightforwardly in intergalactic space with energy-_gain_. the boundary between the galactic and extragalactic space is set to be 40 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "the calculation of their trajectories is finished when the comoving distance of the particles exceeds 1,500 mpc or the energy of the particles exceeds @xmath72 ev .",
    "this energy corresponds to the maximum acceleration energy of protons at sources . as the energy - loss processes of heps ( the energy-_gain _ processes of oppositely - charged protons ) , in addition to bethe - heitler pair creation and photopion production by interactions with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons , adiabatic energy - loss due to the cosmic expansion",
    "is also considered in intergalactic space .",
    "all the energy - loss can be neglected during propagation in the galactic space because all the energy - loss lengths of protons are much larger than the scale of the galactic space .",
    "we assume the standard @xmath73cdm cosmology with @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 km s@xmath77 mpc@xmath77 .",
    "an analytical fitting formula of the energy - loss length of bethe - heitler pair creation by @xcite is used . for photopion production , we adopt inelasticity and mean - free path calculated by an event generator sophia @xcite .    when the trajectory of the @xmath78th oppositely - charged proton passes over sources , a weight below is attached into this trajectory for a positive arriving proton , @xmath79 where @xmath80 labels sources on the trajectory . @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the redshift and comoving distance of the @xmath80th source , respectively .",

    "we randomly select the required number of trajectories according to the probability proportional to @xmath88 .",
    "the energy and arrival directions of the protons are the energy and the injection directions of the corresponding oppositely - charged protons .",
    "we assume that the arrival directions fluctuates following a 2 dimensional gaussian distribution with @xmath89 to take the finite accuracy of the arrival direction determination of hecr observatories into account .",

    "we simulate the apertures of 2 hecr observatories ; the pao and telescope array ( ta ) .",
    "these 2 observatories are complementary because the pao observes the southern sky while the ta observes the northern sky .",
    "thus , we consider these 2 apertures as representatives of hecr observatories in the southern and northern sky .",
    "parameters are @xmath111 and @xmath112 for the pao @xcite , and @xmath113 and @xmath114 for the ta @xcite .",
    "before considering the correlation between the arrival directions of heps and their sources , we examine the trajectories of heps in gmf .",
    "the dipole component of gmf is directed toward the north galactic pole in the galactic plane , and therefore protons coming from extragalactic space propagate clockwise , as viewed from the north galactic pole .",
    "this fact indicates the arrival directions of heps are shifted from the positions of their sources to lower galactic longitude .",
    "this effect is weaker in the direction of the galactic anti - center because of the smaller field strength than in the direction of the galactic center .",
    "the strong dipole field near the galactic center makes the complex trajectories of heps .",
    "in addition , since the dipole field above and below the galactic center has the opposite direction to that in the galactic plane away from the galactic center , the trajectories of heps from the direction of @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the galactic longitude , can be deflected anticlockwise in the direction of @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "the deflection angles of heps are not so large that the correlation disappears completely ( @xmath117 ) except the direction of the galactic center if protons above @xmath118 ev are considered @xcite .",
    "the turbulent component of gmf makes heps propagate diffusively .",
    "the typical deflection angle of a hep is @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the energy of protons and the typical size of the galaxy , respectively .",
    "this estimation is expected to be larger than the deflection angles of protons by the turbulent field in our simulation , since the turbulent field becomes weaker outside the galactic disk .",
    "thus , the turbulent component of gmf subdominantly contributes to the total deflection of heps @xcite and the global deflection pattern of heps produced by the coherent components of gmf is not largely disturbed @xcite .",
    "the spiral component of gmf dominantly affects the deflections of heps .",
    "this is because the solar system is located in the galactic disk , where the spiral field is stronger than in the galactic halo .",
    "the spiral field is stronger ( @xmath122 g ) than the dipole field ( @xmath123 g ) in the vicinity of the solar system .",
    "several examples of the trajectories of heps with @xmath118 ev , which are useful to understand the features of the trajectories in the spiral field , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectories ] .",
    "only the spiral component is taken into account as gmf .",

    "the solar system is located at @xmath125 kpc .",
    "the arrival directions of these heps at the earth are the same , @xmath126 .",
    "practically , we calculate the trajectories of oppositely - charged protons injected from the earth to @xmath126 and regard these trajectories as those of arriving heps .",
    "the trajectory in the bs - s model and that in the bs - a model are duplicated because these two models has the same spiral field above the galactic plane .",
    "the trajectory in the as - s model and that in the as - a model are in the same situation .",
    "the trajectories in the bs models are separated from those in the as models outside @xmath127 kpc because of the existence of the field reversal of the spiral field in the bs models .",
    "once a proton passes over the radius of a field reversal , the deflection direction of the proton is changed into the opposite direction to the direction before .",
    "this effect does not occur in the as models , since the as models do not have the field reversals of gmf .",
    "this effect also allows the total deflection angles of heps to be smaller in the bs models than in the as models .",
    "after the oppositely - charged protons propagate away from the galactic plane , their deflections are smaller because the spiral component of gmf becomes smaller exponentially .",
    "thus , the spiral gmf in the vicinity of the solar system mainly affects the total deflections of heps .",
    "the effect of the parity of the spiral component of gmf can be observed in the other panels .",
    "the lower left panel is the same as the upper panel , but the arrival directions of heps are @xmath128 . due to the difference of the parity , the spiral field of the bs - a ( as - a ) model has the opposite direction to that of the bs - s ( as - s ) model below the galactic plane . in this panel ,",
    "the trajectories of oppositely - charged protons are deflected toward the upside of the galactic plane near the solar system in the cases of gmf models with the s - type parity ( bs - s and as - s ) , while the trajectories are deflected toward the downside of the galactic plane for the gmf models with the a - type parity ( bs - a and as - a ) .",

    "we can see that the deflection angles of these protons are smaller in the bs - s model and bs - a model than in the as - s model and as - a model , as discussed above . since the as - a model and bs - a model",

    "this symmetric feature can be seen for heps emitted from the other sources . comparing protons from a source with @xmath130 with those from a source with @xmath132 ,",
    "for example , we can see the dependence of the deflection angles of protons on source position .",
    "the latter protons are less deflected even for @xmath133 ev than the former protons .",
    "we can also see that protons with the energy of @xmath134 ev are trapped near the galactic center and are largely scattered .",
    "the arrangement of the deflection directions of protons can be a hint to understand the structure of gmf in the direction of sources @xcite .",
    "in fact , protons with the energy lower than @xmath135 ev are difficult to be a probe of gmf structure , since cosmologically distant sources can significantly contribute to the total flux of hecrs .",
    "the background makes the identification of the sources of such low energy protons difficult . on the other hand ,",
    "heps above @xmath136 ev is a good tool for this purpose because they can reach the earth only from nearby sources due to greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) effect @xcite .    finally , we show how the deflection angles of protons are distributed in the sky as a function of their arrival directions .",

    "this figure corresponds to the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectories ] , but the dipole component and the turbulent component of gmf are also taken into account .",
    "the trajectories are complicated and do not follow a simple picture explained at fig .",
    "[ fig : trajectories ] .",
    "the red and magenta lines are trapped by strong field including the turbulent component . in any case , the directions of sources are quite different from the arrival directions of irons .",
    "the propagation of iron nuclei in gmf is studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "[ fig : nuclei ] demonstrates the arrival directions of the pao events before gmf deflections , assuming that all the pao events are protons ( _ green _ ) or irons ( _ blue _ ) . the bs - s model ( _ upper left _ ) , the bs - a model ( _ upper right _ ) , the as - s model ( _ lower left _ ) , the as - a model ( _ lower right _ ) are considered as a spiral component of gmf . the dipole component and the turbulent component of gmf",
    "are also taken into account .",
    "these directions correspond to the positions of their sources if the effect of igmf can be neglected .",
    "the detected arrival directions of the pao events ( _ red _ ) and iras galaxies within @xmath14 ( _ black _ ) are also plotted . in order to make this figure ,",
    "the detected pao events are backtracked in the 4 gmf models and their velocity directions just outside the galaxy ( at 40 kpc from the galactic center ) are plotted .",
    "the deflections of irons are quite large , and the correlation between the arrival directions ( before gmf deflections ) and the galaxy distribution is obviously lost .",
    "it is unnatural that the deflections by igmf improve the correlation .",
    "thus , a pure iron scenario is problematic in the viewpoint of the spatial correlation . since light nuclei including protons",
    "may be contained in detected hecrs in a real situation , the situations can become better , but this figure points out that the contribution of gmf to the total deflections of nuclei are not negligible . in this case",
    ", the fraction of protons ( or light nuclei ) is an important parameter .",
    "this parameter also gives a hint of cosmic - ray composition at sources , i.e. , a hint of the generation mechanism of hecrs .",
    "the arrival directions of irons before gmf modification are dependent on gmf modelling , as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuclei ] . detailed modelling of gmf could also improve the correlation between the arrival directions of hecrs before gmf modification and their sources .",
