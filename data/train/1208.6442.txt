    "attractive interaction between two electrons mediated by a virtual phonon excitation is the origin of cooper paring in conventional superconductors .",
    "virtual boson excitations are also likely to be the origin of cooper paring in the high - temperature cuprate superconductors ( htscs ) , but the nature of the bosons in htscs , phonons or magnetic excitations , has remained controversial . because electron - boson coupling causes a change in the fermi velocity below the boson energy , resulting in a kink in the quasi - particle ( qp ) dispersion curves .",
    "it has been controversial whether the kink is due to phonons @xcite or magnetic excitations @xcite .",
    "the kink in the nodal region is relatively simple because of the absence of a @xmath5-wave superconducting ( sc ) gap in that direction , and may allow us a relatively straightforward interpretation .",
    "according to previous theoretical work @xcite , the nodal qp can be scattered into the antinodal region , where the sc gap is maximum @xmath6 and , therefore , the nodal kink energy can be given by @xmath7 = @xmath8 + @xmath9 in the sc state and @xmath7 = @xmath8 in the normal state , where @xmath8 is the energy of the boson mode and @xmath9 is the magnitude of the sc order parameter at the anti - node .",
    "arpes experiment on the optimally doped double - layer bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath10 ( bi2212 ) @xcite has shown the nodal kink energy to be @xmath7 @xmath3 70 mev in the sc state , which is interpreted as the sum of the boson mode energy @xmath11 35 mev and the anti - nodal sc gap @xmath12 35 mev , consistent with the relationship @xmath7 = @xmath8 + @xmath9 . here , one of the likely candidates for the @xmath3 35 mev mode is the out - of - plane vibration ( buckling mode ) of cu and o atoms .",
    "however , an in - plane optical phonon mode ( half - breathing mode ) , which does not strongly scatter the nodal qp into the anti - nodal region but scatters the nodal qp to another nodal region with @xmath9 = 0 @xcite , should have an energy @xmath3 70 mev , too , according to @xmath7 = @xmath8+@xmath9 .",
    "therefore , one can not determine whether the kink at 70 mev is due to the buckling mode which scatters the nodal qp to the antinodal region where the sc gap opens , or due to the half - breathing mode which scatters the nodal qp to another nodal region , or both .    in order to study the origin of the kink",
    ", we have performed an arpes study on the tri - layer cuprate bi@xmath0sr@xmath0ca@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( bi2223 ) , which shows the highest @xmath4 of 110 k among the bi - based htscs .",
    "the arpes spectra of bi2223 reveal two bands corresponding to the outer and inner cuo@xmath0 planes ( op and ip ) with different @xmath9 s for the op and ip @xcite .",
    "we have found that the kink energies in the nodal direction are remarkably different between the ip and op bands , which can be attributed to the different anti - nodal @xmath9 s between ip and op , consistent with the scenario @xmath7 = @xmath8 + @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have identified a fine structure in the kink of the ip band , which may be partially attributed to the scattering of the nodal qp from ip to op through the excitation of a buckling phonon mode .",
    "single crystals of optimally doped bi2223 ( @xmath4 = 110 k ) were grown by the traveling solvent floating zone method .",
    "arpes experiments were carried out at beam line 9a of the hiroshima synchrotron radiation center ( hisor ) , hiroshima university , using circularly polarized light with @xmath13 = 7.55 , 8.4 , and 11.95 ev . the total energy resolution ( @xmath14 )",

    "black dots indicate band dispersions determined by the peak positions of the momentum distribution curves ( mdcs ) .",
    "one can see that the op and ip bands show anomalies at @xmath3 75 and @xmath3 100 mev , respectively , as shown by a red arrow in the figures . in fig .",

    "is expected to manifest itself as a step in im@xmath22 .",

    "( f),(g ) : re@xmath22 of the op and ip bands at various temperatures .",
    "gray and pink shaded regions highlight the re@xmath22 peak positions of the op and ip bands , respectively . ]",
    "the different kink energies of the op and ip bands can be easily understood if the @xmath3 35 mev boson mode scatters the nodal qp into the anti - nodal region , where the sc gaps of different magnitudes open for the op and ip bands . according to our previous studies @xcite ,",
    "the sc gaps in the anti - nodal region are @xmath9 = 40 mev for the op band and @xmath9 = 60 mev for the ip band . accordingly ,",
    "if the formula @xmath7 = @xmath8 + @xmath9 is applied , @xmath23 @xmath8 + @xmath12 35 + 40 @xmath3 75 ( @xmath24 5 ) mev for the op band and @xmath7 = @xmath8 + @xmath12 35 + 60 @xmath3 95 ( @xmath24 5 ) mev for the ip band , consistent with experiment , and the unusually large kink energy for the ip band can be understood .",
    "since phonon bands are located from 12 to 72 mev according to optical measurements of bi2223 @xcite , the kink energy of @xmath3100 mev observed for the ip band can not be explained without the contribution of the large sc gap of the ip band .",
    "the half - breathing mode of energy @xmath370 mev will also contribute to a kink at @xmath370 - 75 mev for both the op and ip bands though @xmath7 = @xmath25 @xmath3 70 + 0 mev , since the half - breathing mode scatters a nodal qp to another nodal region , where @xmath12 0 .",
    "indeed , the weak shoulder at @xmath370 mev in the re@xmath22 of ip in the sc state may be attributed to the half - breathing mode .",
    "alternatively , the 70 mev shoulder may be attributed to scattering of the nodal qp into the antinodal region of op through the @xmath3 35 mev buckling mode .",
    "figures [ fig2_kink](c ) - [ fig2_kink](e ) show the im@xmath22 and the mdc width at @xmath20 of the op and ip bands at various temperatures .",
    "panel ( e ) shows that the mdc widths at @xmath20 of the op and ip bands increase with temperature and shows a discontinuous change around @xmath4 = 110 k , like the previous experimental results on bi2212 @xcite .",
    "this means that the scattering of the nodal qp is suppressed by the opening of the sc gap .",
    "figures [ fig2_kink](f ) and [ fig2_kink](g ) show re@xmath22 for the op and ip bands at various temperatures .",
    "the peak positions of re@xmath22 do not show an abrupt change at @xmath4 = 110 k but at @xmath26 = 200 k , the peak position for the ip band becomes @xmath3 70 mev .",
    "because the sc gap closes at @xmath4 = 110 k and the pseudogap closes at temperature @xmath27 well above @xmath4 , the change in the kink energy of the ip band would be attributed to the closure or the reduction of the pseudogap in the antinodal region .",
    "the kink energy of @xmath370 mev at @xmath28 200 k is then attributed to the energy of the breathing mode .",
    "as mentioned above , there are two possible explanations for the weak @xmath370 mev shoulder in the re@xmath22 of ip : ( i ) the nodal qp of ip is scattered into the other nodal region through the excitation of the half - breathing mode of energy @xmath3 70 mev , or ( ii ) the nodal qp of ip is scattered into the antinodal region of op through the excitation of @xmath3 35 mev phonons .",
    "if the latter scattering exist , a cooper pair near the node of ip will be scattered into the antinodal region of op with the virtual excitation of the @xmath3 35 mev boson .",
    "this can become a mechanism which enhances @xmath4 in multilayer cuprates @xcite .",
    "as the 35 mev boson , we consider the buckling mode @xcite because such a mode scatters the nodal qp to the anti - nodal one according to refs .",
    "@xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we have performed an arpes experiment on bi2223 and found that the kink energy shows different values between ip and op : @xmath3 75 mev for the op band and @xmath3 100 mev for the ip band .",
    "this difference is attributed to the different sc gap magnitudes between op and ip .",
    "furthermore , we find that the re@xmath22 of ip shows a shoulder structure at @xmath3 70 mev , which may indicate that ( 1 ) the qp of the ip is scattered by the half - breathing mode , or ( 2 ) the inter - layer scattering mediated by the buckling mode occurs .",
