    "a typical formula for measuring @xmath3 is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the closing price of the underlying asset at the _ j_-th observation time @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the number of observations .",
    "the annualized factor @xmath9 follows the sampling frequency to convert the above evaluation to annualized variance points .",
    "assuming there are @xmath10 business days in a year , then @xmath9 is equal to 252 for daily sampling frequency .",
    "however , if the sampling frequency is monthly or weekly , then @xmath9 will be @xmath11 or @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the measure of realized variance requires monitoring the underlying price path discretely , usually at the end of a business day . for this purpose ,",
    "we assume equally discrete observations to be compatible with the real market , which reduces to @xmath13 .",
    "the long position of variance swaps pays a fixed delivery price @xmath2 at the expiration and receives the floating amounts of annualized realized variance , whereas the short position is the opposite .",
    "since variance swaps were first launched in 1998 , the problem of how to price them has been an active research topic in mathematical and quantitative finance .",
    "carr and madan @xcite combined static replication using options with dynamic trading in the futures to price and hedge variance swaps without specifying the volatility process .",
    "demeterfi et al .",
    "@xcite worked in the same direction by proving that a variance swap could be reproduced via a portfolio of standard options .",
    "a finite - difference method via dimension - reduction approach was explored in @xcite to obtain high efficiency and accuracy for pricing discretely - sampled variance swaps . in @xcite , zhu and",
    "lian extended the work in @xcite by incorporating heston two - factor stochastic volatility for pricing discretely - sampled variance swaps .",
    "however , a simpler approach was explored in @xcite , where the schwarts solution procedure was applied to derive an affine solution of pdes .",
    "recently , to extend the work in @xcite where stochastic interest rates were ignored , cao et al . @xcite employed a hybridization of the stochastic volatility model and the cir interest rate model to investigate the pricing rates of variance swaps with discrete sampling . in @xcite , elliott et al . proposed a continuous - time markovian - regulated version of the heston stochastic volatility model to distinguish different states of a business cycle .",
    "an analytical formula for pricing volatility swaps was obtained using the regime - switching esscher transform and comparisons were made between models with and without switching regimes .",
    "the essence of incorporating regime - switching for pricing variance swaps under the heston stochastic volatility model was illustrated in @xcite , where a common assumption is  continuous sampling time \" .",
    "in fact , options of discretely sampled variance swaps were misvalued when the continuous sampling was used as an approximation , and large inaccuracies occurred in certain sampling periods , as discussed in .    in the past decade , many researchers have considered to integrate markovian regime - switching techniques with stochastic interest rate models .",
    "for example , in order to incorporate jumps and inconsistencies between different business stages , elliott et al .",
    "@xcite and siu @xcite used the regime - switching approach to extend the cox - ingersoll - ross ( cir ) , the hull - white and the vasicek models respectively .",
    "however , there exists a gap in the literature regarding pricing volatility derivatives under stochastic volatility and stochastic interest rates with regime - switching . as far as we know , the only existing study was the one conducted in @xcite , which focused only on continuous sampling variance swaps and employed the pde approach . in this paper , we address the issue of pricing discretely - sampled variance swaps under stochastic volatility and stochastic interest rate with regime - switching .",
    "we extend the framework of both @xcite and @xcite by incorporating the cir stochastic interest rate into the markov - modulated version of the heston stochastic volatility model .",
    "this hybrid model possesses parameters that switch according to a continuous - time observable markov chain process which can be interpreted as the states of an observable macroeconomic factor .",
    "our approach is different from that of @xcite . instead of the continuous sampling approach , we use the discrete sampling approach to improve accuracy in pricing and computational efficiency .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , a detailed description of regime - switching hybrid model",
    "is first provided , followed by derivation of the dynamics for the model under the _ t_-forward measure . in section 3 ,",
    "we derive the forward characteristic function in order to obtain the semi - analytical formula for the price of variance swaps . in section 4 ,",
    "some numerical examples are given , demonstrating the accuracy of our solution and impacts of regime - switching . in section 5 , a brief summary and comparisons of our results with other relevant results in the literature",
    "are provided .",
    "in this section , we develop a hybrid model which combines the heston stochastic volatility model with the one - factor cir stochastic interest rate dynamics including regime - switching effects . a regime - switching model for pricing volatility derivatives",

    "in fact , the error calculated between our pricing formula and the simulation is less than 0.077% for @xmath260 , and this error will be reduced as the number of sample paths increases .",
    "in addition , it should be emphasized that for @xmath261 , the run time of our pricing formula is only 3.28 seconds , whereas the simulation takes about 8200 seconds .",
    "it is clear that our pricing formula attains almost the same accuracy in far less time compared to the simulation which serves as benchmark values .      in order to explore the effect of regime - switching , in figure 2 , we present results produced by formula ( [ finalformchap5 ] ) and by the heston - cir model without regime - switching in @xcite . for the heston - cir model without regime - switching , we fix the parameter values to be @xmath262 and @xmath263 .",
    "we observe that the prices of variance swaps obtained from the heston - cir model with regime - switching are significantly lower than those from the corresponding model without regime - switching .",
    "for example , for @xmath260 , the difference between variance swaps prices calculated from the two models is 7.32% .",
    "this can be explained from the values of @xmath264 and @xmath265 which remain constant , whereas the values of @xmath250 and @xmath255 in the heston - cir model with regime - switching vary according to the changing states .",
    "besides that , for the weekly sampling case , the difference in variance swaps prices between the two models becomes larger and stabilizes as the sampling frequency reaches 52 .",
    "one possible explanation for this is the number of transitions between states in the heston - cir model with regime - switching increases as the sampling frequency increases .",
    "in addition , we also examine the economic aftermath for the prices of variance swaps by allowing the heston - cir model to switch across three regimes .",
    "in particular , we denote @xmath262 and @xmath263 for the contraction state , @xmath266 and @xmath267 for the trough state , and @xmath268 and @xmath269 for the expansion state , respectively .",
    "these values are assumed by noting that a good ( resp .",
    "bad ) economy is identified by high ( resp .",
    "low ) interest rate and low ( resp .",
    "high ) volatility .",
    "we provide the variance swaps pricing outcome for these three regimes in table 2 .",

    "this trend is consistent throughout all sampling frequencies from @xmath261 to @xmath260 .",
    "we can relate this finding to the economic condition of each of the states .",
    "in particular , the trough state is the state with the worst economy among the three , whereas the expansion state resembles the best economy .",
    "thus , the price of a variance swap is cheapest in the best economy among the three , and most expensive in the worst economy among all .",
    "this implies that regime - switching has an important impact in capturing the economic changes on the prices of variance swaps .",
    "the evaluation of variance swaps has been an active research topic in recent years . in @xcite ,",
    "the continuously sampled variance swaps were priced under the regime switching schbel - zhu - hull - white hybrid model .",
    "however , variance swaps are written on the realized variance based on daily closing prices in practice . to improve the pricing accuracy of these contracts , zhu and lian @xcite developed closed - form pricing formulas of discretely sampled variance swaps based on the framework of heston s stochastic volatility model where the interest rate followed a deterministic process . in @xcite , a hybridization of the heston stochastic volatility model and the cir stochastic interest rate model",
    "was considered .",
    "the hybrid model extended the heston stochastic volatility model in @xcite by modelling the interest rate as the cir process .",
    "the effect of stochastic interest rate on the price of discretely sampled variance swaps was demonstrated .",
    "elliott and lian @xcite made another extension of the framework of heston s stochastic volatility model in the direction of including regime switching dynamics in the model .",
    "it was shown that incorporating regime switching into the heston model had a significant impact on the price of volatility swaps .    since both regime switching and stochastic interest rate process affect the price of variance swaps , we propose a model incorporating both stochastic interest rate and regime switching effects .",
    "specifically , the proposed model combines the cir stochastic interest rate into the markov - modulated regime switching version of the heston stochastic volatility .",
    "our model is capable of capturing several macroeconomic issues such as alternating business cycles . in particular , we assume that the long - term mean of variance of the risky stock and the long - term mean of the interest rate depend on the states of the economy indicated by a regime - switching markov chain .",
    "we demonstrate our solution techniques and derive a semi - closed form formula for pricing variance swaps .",
    "numerical experiments reveal that our pricing formula attains almost the same accuracy in far less time compared with the mc simulation .",
    "to analyse the effects of incorporating regime - switching into pricing variance swaps , we first compare the variance swaps prices calculated from the regime - switching heston - cir model with the corresponding model without regime - switching .",
    "we find that the prices of variance swaps obtained from the regime - switching heston - cir model are significantly different from those from the heston - cir model without regime - switching . in our case",
    ", the heston - cir model without regime - switching corresponds to the state _ contraction _ , and the price of a variance swap obtained from the regime - switching heston - cir model is much lower than that obtained from the heston - cir model without regime - switching .",
    "if the heston - cir model without regime - switching corresponds to other states , the conclusion can be different .",
    "next , we explore the economic consequence for the prices of variance swaps by allowing the heston - cir model to switch across three regimes defined as the best , moderate and worst economy .",
    "we notice that the price of a variance swap is cheapest in the best economy among the three , and most expensive in the worst economy among all .",
    "this confirms the essence of incorporating regime - switching in pricing variance swaps ."
