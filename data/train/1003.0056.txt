    "the primordial fluctuations from inflation is supposed to be statistically isotropic , gaussian , and scale invariant .",
    "the nature of fluctuations is associated with the nature of de sitter spacetime . however , since the expansion during inflation is not exactly de sitter , the power spectrum is slightly tilted by the order of the slow roll parameter  @xcite which characterizes the deviation of the expansion from the exact de sitter expansion . the deviation from the gaussianity",
    "is also known to be related to the slow roll parameter  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the statistical isotropy has been regarded as a robust prediction so far because the cosmic no - hair conjecture is thought to be robust  @xcite .    from an observational point of view",
    ", there are various indications that there exists statistical anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb )  @xcite .",
    "although the statistical significance of these anomalies is still under debate , the possibility of the statistical anisotropy certainly deserves further theoretical investigation  @xcite . recently , breaking the statistical isotropy through the vector fields in an inflationary universe is proposed in the paper  @xcite and extended in various ways  @xcite .",
    "however , if the vector field is relevant to inflation , it may also produce anisotropy in an inflationary universe whatever small it is , which seems to contradict the cosmic no - hair conjecture .    from the above perspective",
    ", it is interesting to ask if it is possible to have anisotropic inflationary universe  @xcite .",
    "if possible , it provides a simple mechanism to break the statistical isotropy by breaking the isotropy of the spacetime  @xcite . in the light of no - hair conjecture  @xcite",
    ", one may deny this possibility .",
    "in fact , many attempts to construct anisotropic inflationary models suffer from the instability  @xcite .",
    "however , recently , stable anisotropic inflationary models are found for the first time  @xcite .",
    "this can be regarded as a counter example to the cosmic no - hair conjecture .",
    "the interesting point is that the deviation from isotropy is related to the slow roll parameter , namely , the deviation from the exact desitter expansion .",
    "of course , that means the degree of the anisotropy is quite small . from the point of view of precision cosmology",
    ", however , it is worth exploring theoretical fine structure in an inflationary scenario .    in this paper",
    ", we study cosmological perturbations in an anisotropic inflationary scenario we have found .",
    "the expected phenomenology of the anisotropic inflation is as follows :    * there should be statistical anisotropy in curvature perturbations .",
    "* there should be statistical anisotropy in gravitational waves .",
    "* there should exist the cross correlation between curvature perturbations and gravitational waves .",
    "* there should be linear polarization of gravitational waves .",
    "the first item will be tested by the planck  @xcite .",
    "the second one may be detected through b - mode polarization in the cmb  @xcite .",
    "the third one will imply t - b correlation in cmb  @xcite",
    ". the last one could be important for the future direct measurement of gravitational waves through the interferometer  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to calculate the above quantities numerically and analytically and reveal the physics behind them .",
    "since the spacetime is anisotropic , the formalism treating perturbations is non - standard .",
    "although there are many works treating the cosmological perturbations in an anisotropic universe  @xcite , there have been several obstructions in extracting concrete predictions for cmb .",
    "the main obstruction was the lack of the concrete anisotropic cosmological models .",
    "now , since we have such models , we have succeeded in obtaining concrete results by utilizing the canonical gauge which is a generalization of the flat slicing in the conventional isotropic inflationary scenario .",
    "recently , during our slow preparation of this paper , two papers have appeared on the archive  @xcite .",
    "the first one @xcite studied the primordial perturbations in an anisotropic inflationary universe using a perturbative method .",
    "the second one @xcite investigated the same issue numerically .",
    "the conclusion is quite similar to ours .",
    "the main difference is the gauge used in analysis .",
    "our canonical gauge allows us to reveal the nature of primordial fluctuations from anisotropic inflation in a transparent way . interestingly , on the contrary to a naive expectation , all of these works including ours",
    "imply that even if the anisotropy of the universe is very small , a large statistical anisotropy in the spectrum of curvature perturbations could be created .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section ii , we review an anisotropic inflation which is caused by the inflaton coupled to the vector field . here , we will see the anisotropy is determined by the slow roll parameter . in section iii , we choose the canonical gauge which is a generalization of the flat slicing in the conventional inflation and classify perturbations in anisotropic universe based on the 2-dimensional rotation symmetry .",
    "then , we obtain the quadratic action for perturbed quantities . in section iv , we reduce the action to that for physical variables from which we can read off the structure of couplings between those variables . based on the reduced action , we calculate various statistical quantities numerically and analytically to reveal the nature of primordial fluctuations in anisotropic inflation . in section",
    "v , we discuss cosmological implication of our results .",
    "the final section is devoted to the conclusion . in the appendix",
    "a , we provide a detailed derivation of the action for 2-dimensional scalar sector perturbations .",
    "in this section , we review background solutions proposed in @xcite , and see how the anisotropic inflation is realized .",
    "we consider the vector field @xmath0 whose kinetic term is coupled to the inflaton field @xmath1 .",

    "we assume that the background spacetime is given by the bianchi type i metric @xmath10 as for the vector field , it can be reduced into `` electric''(@xmath11 ) and `` magnetic''(@xmath12 ) components , and here we consider only the `` electric '' component for simplicity .",
    "it is not hard to prove that the direction of the `` electric '' field does not change in time by solving its evolution equation . without loosing the generality",
    ", one can take @xmath13-axis in the direction of the `` electric '' field . using the gauge invariance",
    ", we can express the vector field as @xmath14 .",

    "given this configuration , it is convenient to parameterize the metric as follows : @xmath17 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are an isotropic scale factor and spatial shears , respectively .",
    "we also define the averaged hubble parameter as @xmath21 . here , the lapse function @xmath22 is introduced to obtain the hamiltonian constraint . with the above ansatz ,",

    "taking the variation of the action with respect to @xmath32 and @xmath1 and substituting the solution ( [ eq : ax ] ) , we obtain the following basic equations : @xmath33 \\ , \\label{eq : hamiltonian}\\\\ % \\ddot{\\alpha } & = & -3\\dot{\\alpha}^2+\\kappa ^2 v(\\phi ) + \\frac{\\kappa ^2 p_a^2}{6}f(\\phi ) ^{-2}e^{-4\\alpha-4\\sigma } \\ , \\label{eq : alpha}\\\\ % \\ddot{\\sigma } & = &   -3\\dot{\\alpha}\\dot{\\sigma}+\\frac{\\kappa ^2 p_a^2}{3}f(\\phi)^{-2}e^{-4\\alpha -4\\sigma } \\ , \\label{eq : sigma}\\\\ % \\ddot{\\phi } & = & -3\\dot{\\alpha}\\dot{\\phi}-v_{\\phi}+p_a^2f(\\phi)^{-3 } f_{\\phi}e^{-4\\alpha -4\\sigma } \\label{eq : inflaton } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscript in @xmath34 denotes derivative with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "let us check whether inflation occurs in this model .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ eq : alpha ] ) , the equation for acceleration of the cosmic expansion is given by @xmath35 \\ .\\ ] ] we see that the potential energy of the inflaton needs to be dominant and the energy density of the vector field @xmath36 and the shear @xmath37 should be subdominant for inflation to occur .",
    "next we want to see if the anisotropy is produced during inflation . here",
    "we look at the ratio of the shear to the expansion rate @xmath38 to characterize the anisotropy of the inflationary universe .",
    "then , eq.([eq : sigma ] ) reads @xmath39 if the anisotropy converges to a value , i.e. @xmath40 becomes negligible , the terminal value should be given by @xmath41 where we used the slow roll equation @xmath42 derived from eq.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) and defined the energy ratio @xmath43 .    in order to realize the above situation",
    ", @xmath44 must be almost constant .",
    "assuming that the vector field is subdominant in the evolution equation of the inflaton field eq.([eq : inflaton ] ) and the conventional single field slow - roll inflation is realized , one can show the coupling function @xmath9 should be proportional to @xmath45 to keep @xmath44 almost constant . in the slow roll phase , @xmath46-folding number @xmath47 is related to the inflaton field @xmath1 as @xmath48 as usual .",
    "then , the functional form of @xmath9 is determined as @xmath49 for the polynomial potential @xmath50 , for example , we have @xmath51 . in this scenario ,",
    "the anisotropy is restricted from the condition that the vector field is negligible in eq.([eq : inflaton ] ) , that is , @xmath52 substituting eq.([eq : function ] ) into this , we obtain @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the slow - roll parameter defined by @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the anisotropy is constrained by @xmath56 .",
    "the above case is , in a sense , a critical one , and next we want to consider beyond it . for simplicity ,",
    "we parameterize @xmath9 by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a constant parameter .",
    "now , we look at what happens when @xmath59 .",

    "\\label{eq : inflaton2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this case , if the vector field is initially small @xmath61 , then the conventional single field slow - roll inflation is realized . during this stage @xmath62 and the vector field grows as @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , the vector field eventually becomes relevant to the inflaton dynamics eq.([eq : inflaton2 ] ) .",

    "in fact , if @xmath64 exceeds @xmath65 , the inflaton field @xmath1 does not roll down , which makes @xmath66 decrease .",
    "hence , @xmath67 always holds . in this sense",
    ", there exists an attractor where the inflation continues even when the vector field affects the inflaton evolution .",
    "the inflaton dynamics is determined by solving the slow - roll equation : @xmath68 assuming @xmath69 , this yields @xmath70 this can be integrated by neglecting the evolutions of @xmath71 as @xmath72   \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting this into the slow - roll equation eq.([eq : inflaton4 ] ) , we obtain @xmath73 ^{-1 } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this clearly shows a transition from the conventional single field slow - roll inflationary phase , where @xmath74 holds , to what we refer to as the second inflationary phase , where the vector field is relevant to the inflaton dynamics and the inflaton gets @xmath75 times slower as @xmath76 .",
    "in the second inflationary phase , the energy density of the vector field becomes @xmath77 which yields the anisotropy of @xmath78 . from eqs.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ eq : alpha ] ) , the slow - roll parameter defined in terms of the scale factor becomes @xmath79 where we neglected the anisotropy and used relations @xmath80 and @xmath69 .",
    "thus we have a remarkable result @xmath81 in the next section , we will make a perturbative analysis during this second inflationary phase .",
    "since the background is expanding anisotropically , we can not use the standard cosmological perturbation theory . in this section ,",
    "we classify perturbations under the 2-dimensional rotational symmetry and obtain the quadratic actions for 2-dimensional scalar and vector sectors . in order to grasp the meaning of variables ,",
    "we start with the isotropic case and make a gauge transformation from the flat slicing gauge to the appropriate gauge for 2-dimensional classification .",
    "then , the resultant gauge can be promoted to the anisotropic spacetime .",
    "the gauge we have chosen makes the analysis and the interpretation easier .",
    "once the gauge is fixed , the quadratic action can be calculated .",
    "first , we will start with the spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe . for simplicity",
    ", we consider flat space .",
    "@xmath82 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we took a conformal time @xmath83 . in that case",
    ", we can use 3-dimensional rotational symmetry to classify the perturbed metric .",
    "when we want to have diagonal quadratic action , we take the following gauge @xmath84\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we imposed @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "if we ignore vector and tensor perturbations @xmath87 , the above gauge is called the flat slicing gauge .",
    "now , let us move on to the fourier space .",
    "since there exists 3-dimensional rotation symmetry , we can take a wave number vector to be @xmath88 .",
    "then , the perturbed metric has the following components : @xmath89 here , we utilized the special choice @xmath88 to solve the constraints @xmath85 and @xmath86 . with the same reason",
    ", only @xmath90 remains .",
    "we defined @xmath91 .",
    "now , we will pretend that we have only 2-dimensional rotation symmetry in @xmath15-@xmath16 plane . in that case , at best , we can take @xmath92 .",
    "hence , we make a rotation in the @xmath93-plane so that the wave number becomes @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath94 where we have a relation @xmath95 . under this rotation ,",
    "the perturbed metric becomes @xmath96 to simplify the perturbations , we can make use of gauge transformation @xmath97 where the semicolon denotes the covariant derivative with respect to the background metric . taking the parameter @xmath98 we obtain @xmath99 it should be noted that we did not change slicing but performed only the spatial coordinate transformation .",
    "therefore , we are still working in the flat slicing where the 3-dimensional scalar curvature vanishes .    in our anisotropic inflation models ,",
    "the available symmetry is actually small .",
    "the background metric is given by @xmath100 that is , @xmath101 .",
    "notice that the conformal time in anisotropic inflation is the conformal time in 2-dimensional part @xmath102 .",
    "even in this anisotropic spacetime , as we have done in ( [ gauge - a ] ) , one can take the following gauge @xmath103 where we can impose further conditions so that the perturbed metric goes back to ( [ gauge - a ] ) in the isotropic limit .",
    "one can classify the perturbed metric using the rotational symmetry in @xmath104-plane . in 2-dimensional flat space , an arbitrary vector @xmath105 where @xmath106 can be decomposed into the scalar part @xmath107 and the vector part @xmath108 .",
    "since there exists no tensor part in 2-dimensions , 2-dimensional tensor can be constructed from the 2-dimensional vector .",
    "because of the symmetry , the scalar and vector parts are not mixed in the equations .",
    "thus , the metric perturbations can be classified to the scalar sector and the vector sector .",
    "thanks to the symmetry in the @xmath104 plane , without loss of generality , we can take the wave number vector to be @xmath109 .",
    "hence , the vector sector in 2-dimensional classification can be identified as @xmath110 in the above perturbed metric .",
    "the remaining components @xmath111 belong to the scalar sector .",
    "thus , the perturbations that belong to 2d vector perturbations , can be written as @xmath112 where we have incorporated the anisotropy while keeping the spatial scalar curvature to be zero .",

    "<S> we study the statistical nature of primordial fluctuations from an anisotropic inflation which is realized by a vector field coupled to an inflaton . </S>",
    "<S> we find a suitable gauge , which we call the canonical gauge , for anisotropic inflation by generalizing the flat slicing gauge in conventional isotropic inflation . </S>",
    "<S> using the canonical gauge , we reveal the structure of the couplings between curvature perturbations , vector waves , and gravitational waves . </S>",
    "<S> we identify two sources of anisotropy , i.e. the anisotropy due to the anisotropic expansion of the universe and that due to the anisotropic couplings among variables . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the latter effect is dominant . </S>",
    "<S> since the coupling between the curvature perturbations and vector waves is the strongest one , the statistical anisotropy in the curvature perturbations is larger than that in gravitational waves . </S>",
    "<S> we find the cross correlation between the curvature perturbations and gravitational waves which never occurs in conventional inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we also find the linear polarization of gravitational waves . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss cosmological implication of our results . </S>"
