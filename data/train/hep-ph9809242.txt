    "the highest energy cosmic ray ( hecr ) events observed above @xmath2eev ( 1 eev@xmath3 ev )  @xcite are difficult to explain within conventional models involving first order fermi acceleration of charged particles at astrophysical shocks  @xcite .",
    "it is hard to accelerate protons and heavy nuclei up to such energies even in the most powerful astrophysical objects  @xcite such as radio galaxies and active galactic nuclei .",
    "also , nucleons above @xmath4eev lose energy drastically due to photo - pion production on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) effect  @xcite  which limits the distance to possible sources to less than @xmath5mpc  @xcite .",
    "heavy nuclei are photodisintegrated in the cmb within a few mpc  @xcite .",
    "there are no obvious astronomical sources within @xmath6 mpc of the earth .",
    "a way around these difficulties is to suppose the hecr are created directly at energies comparable to or exceeding the observed ones rather than being accelerated from lower energies . in the current versions of such `` top - down '' ( td ) scenarios , predominantly @xmath0-rays and neutrinos",
    "are initially produced at ultra - high energies ( uhes ) by the decay of supermassive elementary  x \" particles related to some grand unified theory ( gut ) .",
    "such x particles could be released from topological defect relics of phase transitions which might have been caused by spontaneous breaking of gut symmetries in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "td models of this type are attractive because they predict injection spectra which are considerably harder than shock acceleration spectra and , unlike the gzk effect for nucleons , there is no threshold effect in the attenuation of uhe @xmath0-rays .",
    "there has been considerable discussion in the literature whether the @xmath0-ray , nucleon , and neutrino fluxes predicted by td scenarios are consistent with all the relevant observational data and constraints at various energies  @xcite .",
    "the absolute flux levels predicted by td models are in general uncertain .",
    "while some ( though perhaps not all ) processes involving cosmic strings seem to yield negligibly low fluxes  @xcite , other processes such as those involving annihilation of magnetic monopole - antimonopole pairs  @xcite , cosmic necklaces  @xcite , and possible  @xcite ( but currently controversial  @xcite ) direct emission of x particles from cosmic strings  @xcite can , for reasonable values of parameters , yield x particles at rates sufficient to explain the observed hecr flux .    in this work , instead of trying to calculate the absolute fluxes in specific td models , we use the strategy to numerically calculate the fluxes of nucleons , @xmath0-rays , and neutrinos , `` optimally '' normalize them to match data and constraints , and discuss the feasibility and consequences of a set of most `` favorable '' ranges of the relevant parameters implied by our calculations .",
    "a major new feature of our calculations is that our `` all particle '' propagation code includes the feed - back effect of neutrino cascading on the electromagnetic and hadronic channels in a fully self - consistent manner ( see below ) .",
    "in addition , spurred by recent experimental indications of a possible small neutrino mass , we include in our calculations the effects of a small neutrino mass ( @xmath7 ev ) and the consequent z - boson resonance in the interaction of uhe neutrinos with the thermal neutrinos .",
    "the x particles released from topological defects could be gauge bosons , higgs bosons , superheavy fermions , etc .",
    "depending on the specific gut .",
    "these x particles would have a mass @xmath8 comparable to the symmetry breaking scale and would rapidly decay into leptons and/or quarks of roughly comparable energy .",
    "we will accordingly consider several possibilities for the decay products .",
    "prior calculations were restricted to decay into only quarks .",
    "the quarks interact strongly and hadronize into nucleons ( @xmath9s ) and pions , the latter decaying in turn into @xmath0-rays , electrons , and neutrinos . given the x particle production rate , @xmath10 , the effective injection spectrum of particle species @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) via the hadronic channel can be written as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the relevant fragmentation function ( ff ) .",
    "for the total hadronic ff , @xmath16 , we use solutions of the qcd evolution equations in modified leading logarithmic approximation which provide good fits to accelerator data at lep energies  @xcite , as well as recently suggested extensions for supersymmetry  @xcite ( we abbreviate these cases by `` no - susy '' and `` susy '' , respectively ) . the difference in the results for these two choices will be a measure of the uncertainty associated with the ff .",
    "furthermore , the nucleon content @xmath17 of the hadrons is assumed to be in the range 3 to 10% , and the rest pions distributed equally among the three charge states ( see , however , ref .",
    "the standard pion decay spectra then give the injection spectra of @xmath0-rays , electrons , and neutrinos .",
    "the x particle injection rate is assumed to be spatially uniform and in the matter - dominated era can be parametrized as @xmath18  @xcite , where @xmath19 depends on the specific defect scenario . in this paper",
    "we focus on the case @xmath20 which is representative of a number of specific td processes involving ordinary cosmic strings  @xcite , necklaces  @xcite and magnetic monopoles  @xcite .",
    "finally , we assume that the x particles are nonrelativistic at decay .",
    "the @xmath0-rays and electrons produced by x particle decay initiate electromagnetic ( em ) cascades on low energy radiation fields such as the cmb .",
    "the high energy photons undergo electron - positron pair production ( pp ; @xmath21 ) , and at energies below @xmath22 ev they interact mainly with the universal infrared and optical ( ir / o ) backgrounds , while above @xmath23 eev they interact mainly with the universal radio background ( urb ) . in the klein - nishina regime , where the center of mass energy is large compared to the electron mass , one of the outgoing particles usually carries most of the initial energy .",
    "this `` leading '' electron ( positron ) in turn can transfer almost all of its energy to a background photon via inverse compton scattering ( ics ; @xmath24 ) .",
    "em cascades are driven by this cycle of pp and ics .",
    "the energy degradation of the `` leading '' particle in this cycle is slow , whereas the total number of particles grows exponentially with time .",
    "this makes a standard monte carlo treatment difficult .",
    "we have therefore used an implicit numerical scheme to solve the relevant kinetic equations .",
    "a detailed account of our transport equation approach is in ref .",
    "we include all em interactions that influence the @xmath0-ray spectrum in the energy range @xmath25ev , namely pp , ics , triplet pair production ( tpp ; @xmath26 ) , and double pair production ( @xmath27 ) , as well as synchrotron losses of electrons in the large scale extragalactic magnetic field ( egmf ) .    similarly to photons ,",
    "uhe neutrinos give rise to neutrino cascades in the primordial neutrino background via exchange of w and z bosons  @xcite .",
    "besides the secondary neutrinos which drive the neutrino cascade , the w and z decay products include charged leptons and quarks which in turn feed into the em and hadronic channels .",
    "neutrino interactions become especially significant if the relic neutrinos have masses @xmath28 in the ev range and thus constitute hot dark matter , because the z boson resonance then occurs at an uhe neutrino energy @xmath29 ev .",
    "in fact , this has been proposed as a significant source of hecrs  @xcite .",
    "motivated by recent experimental evidence for neutrino mass we assumed a mass of 1 ev for all three neutrino flavors and implemented the relevant w boson interactions in the t - channel and the z boson exchange via t- and s - channel .",
    "hot dark matter is also expected to cluster , potentially increasing secondary @xmath0-ray and nucleon production  @xcite .",
    "this influences mostly scenarios where x decays into neutrinos only .",
    "we parametrize massive neutrino clustering by a length scale @xmath30 and an overdensity @xmath31 .",
    "values of @xmath32 few mpc and @xmath33 are conceivable on the local supercluster scale  @xcite .",
    "the relevant nucleon interactions implemented are pair production by protons ( @xmath34 ) , photoproduction of single or multiple pions ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) , and neutron decay .",
    "production of secondary @xmath0-rays , electrons , and neutrinos by pion decay is also included , but is in general negligible in the context of td scenarios where injection is dominated by @xmath0-rays and neutrinos over nucleons .",
    "we assume a flat universe with no cosmological constant , and a hubble constant of @xmath37 in units of @xmath38 throughout .",
    "an important difference with respect to past work is that we follow _ all _ produced particles in the em , hadronic , and neutrino channel , whereas the often - used continuous energy loss ( cel ) approximation ( e.g. , @xcite ) follows only the leading cascade particles .",
    "we find that the cel approximation can significantly underestimate the cascade flux at lower energies .",
    "the two major uncertainties in the particle transport are the intensity and spectrum of the urb for which there exists only an estimate above a few mhz frequency  @xcite , and the average value of the egmf .",
    "to bracket these uncertainties we performed simulations for the observational urb estimate from ref .",
    "@xcite that has a low - frequency cutoff at 2 mhz ( `` minimal '' ) , and the medium and maximal theoretical estimates from ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as for egmfs between zero and @xmath39 g , the latter motivated by limits from faraday rotation measurements  @xcite .",

    "this is confirmed by the numerical calculations , as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] and  [ fig : f3 ] and from tab .",
    "[ tab : t1 ] .",
    "we therefore conclude that for most combinations of the urb and the egmf , the most poorly known astrophysical ingredients , one can find combinations of possible decay modes and ffs that make @xmath20 td models with homogeneous source distribution viable hecr explanations for @xmath66 gev .",
    "we note in this context that in some gut models , certain baryon number violating decay modes involving leptons and quarks may violate limits on proton decay if @xmath8 is too far below @xmath67 gev , and may therefore be disfavored , see , for example ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the energy loss and absorption lengths for uhe nucleons and photons are short ( @xmath68 mpc ) .",
    "thus , their predicted uhe fluxes are independent of cosmological evolution . the @xmath0-ray flux below @xmath69 ev , however , scales as the total x particle energy release integrated over all redshifts and increases with decreasing @xmath19  @xcite roughly as @xmath70 .",
    "scenarios with @xmath71 are therefore in general ruled out ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : f1 ] and  [ fig : f2 ] ) , whereas constant comoving injection rates ( @xmath72 ) are well within the limits . since the em flux above @xmath73 ev is efficiently recycled to lower energies , the constraint on @xmath19 is in general less sensitive to @xmath8 then expected from earlier cel - based analytical estimates  @xcite .",
    "a specific @xmath72 scenario is realized in the case where the supermassive x particles have a lifetime longer than the age of the universe and constitute part of cold dark matter , for which non - thermal production in the early universe has recently been identified as a serious possibility  @xcite . in this case , local clustering of the sources in the galactic halo has to be taken into account which provides the dominant contribution to observable fluxes  @xcite . as a consequence , predicted spectra and composition just reflect the injection spectrum , and the diffuse @xmath0-ray background at egret energies is not a serious constraint .",
    "we now turn to signatures of td models at uhes .",
    "the full cascade calculations predict @xmath0-ray fluxes below 100 eev that are a factor @xmath74 and @xmath75 higher than those obtained using the cel or absorption approximation often used in the literature  @xcite , in the case of strong and weak urb , respectively .",
    "this is also reflected by comparing eq .",
    "( [ q0 ] ) for the @xmath0-ray flux with the energy injection rate @xmath76 allowed by the egret observations , which yields @xmath77 mpc .",
    "again , this shows the importance of non - leading particles in the development of unsaturated em cascades at energies below @xmath78 ev . as a consequence , in all viable hecr explaining cases with only quarks among the x particle decay products , we obtain @xmath0/nucleon ratios above 200 eev that are @xmath79 for @xmath80 gev , and about a factor 2 smaller for @xmath81 gev , even for the maximal urb ,",
    "if the egmf is @xmath56 g. this ratio is about a factor 3 higher for the decay modes containing a charged lepton .",
    "although a @xmath0-ray primary for the hecr events is somewhat disfavored currently  @xcite , the compositional issue is not settled yet , but future experiments such as the pierre auger project  @xcite should be able to distinguish @xmath0-ray and nucleon primaries and test this signature . we stress that there are viable scenarios with nucleon fluxes that are comparable with or even higher than the @xmath0-ray flux at all energies in case of the high urb and/or for a strong egmf , and @xmath57 , see figs .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] and  [ fig : f3 ] , and tab .",
    "[ tab : t1 ] .",
    "the predictions from the susy ff in fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] even seems able to explain all cosmic rays above @xmath82 eev , including the dip around 100 eev , as a cross - over from nucleon domination to an about equal mixture of @xmath0-rays and nucleons .",
    "the low @xmath8 , pure quark decay modes such as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] may be able to explain all cosmic rays above 10 eev by nucleon primaries , but also tend to produce a more rapid fall - off of fluxes beyond 100 eev , which constitutes another testable signature .",
    "the @xmath0/nucleon ratio above 100 eev is about a factor 5 and 10 higher in the medium and minimal urb , respectively , as compared to the strong urb case , and in general decreases strongly with increasing egmf @xmath83 g.    as indicated in tab .",
    "[ tab : t1 ] , another interesting scenario involves the pure neutrino decay modes , also shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : f4 ] for @xmath84 gev . here ,",
    "the @xmath0-rays and nucleons are produced as secondaries from the interactions of these uhe neutrinos with the relic neutrinos .",
    "because @xmath0-rays and nucleons above 100 eev must have been produced within a distance @xmath85 few mpc from the observer , their flux is dominantly produced by interactions with the locally clustered neutrinos if @xmath86 . in this case , the energy fluence in the secondaries is about @xmath87 times the energy fluence in primary neutrinos around the z resonance , where @xmath88 is the fractional width of the z and @xmath89 gpc is the neutrino mean free path at the z resonance at zero redshift .",
    "in contrast , at energies where the universe is transparent for particles today , the dominant contribution to their production by uhe neutrinos comes from interactions with the unclustered relic neutrino component at high redshift .",
    "this is because for energies @xmath90 , the probability for both resonant and non - resonant interaction with the relic background per redshift interval is roughly @xmath91 in the matter dominated regime , where @xmath92 is the age of the universe ( for @xmath93 this probability decreases linearly with @xmath94 ) .",
    "because the universe is opaque for @xmath0-rays above @xmath95 tev , this implies that the diffuse @xmath0-ray background below some energy @xmath94 is sensitive to the injection history at @xmath96 .",
    "this explains why the @xmath0-ray background is steeper below 10 gev than in the scenarios where its dominant production is not by neutrino interactions , see fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] . as a further consequence of neutrino interactions , the secondary neutrino fluxes below an energy @xmath93 are sensitive to the injection history at @xmath97 . for @xmath20 scenarios ,",
    "all other fluxes are insensitive to the injection history at @xmath98 . since we are mainly interested in neutrino fluxes above 10 eev and @xmath0-ray fluxes above 100 mev , it was therefore sufficient to integrate injection up to @xmath99 which also approximately marks the transition to radiation domination .",
    "in addition , for @xmath20 , the scaling of neutrino interaction rates implies that the energy content in the secondaries , and thus in particular in the low energy cascade @xmath0-rays , constitutes a few percent of the energy in uhe neutrinos .",
    "this fixes the maximally allowed uhe neutrino flux which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] and implies the lower limit on @xmath100 given in tab .",
    "[ tab : t1 ] which is required if secondaries of uhe neutrino interactions are to explain hecrs .",
    "the maximal energy injection rate in neutrinos today allowed by the egret limit is correspondingly higher than the upper bound on @xmath76 by about a factor 100 .",
    "observational consequences of the uhe neutrino fluxes are discussed in the following section .",
    "the spectra predicted by scenarios where the x particles decay into more than two quanta are qualitatively similar to the ones for decay into two particles of the same type .",
    "the details , however , depend on the energy distributions of the decay products .",
    "to avoid introducing further model dependent parameters , we do not consider such refinements in the present paper as we do not consider scenarios where the x particles themselves are created with relativistic energies .",
    "in order to discuss the prospects of detectability of neutrino fluxes in td scenarios we express the ( in general energy dependent ) experimental sensitivities in terms of the ice or water equivalent acceptance @xmath101 ( in units of volume times solid angle ) .",
    "future neutrino telescopes of kilometer scale or larger will utilize the detection of cherenkov radiation from muons and em showers created in interactions of the neutrinos with nucleons either in ice or in the deep sea .",
    "examples for experiments that aim at this effective size are the icecube version of the amanda experiment at the south pole , as well as the radio ice cherenkov experiment ( rice ) that aims at measuring the radio pulse from the neutrino interaction , the french astronomy with a neutrino telescope and abyss environmental research ( antares ) proposal , and the nestor project in the mediterranian .",
    "an alternative method is to search for extensive air showers initiated by electrons produced by neutrinos via the charged current process .",
    "the interaction length of cosmic ray hadrons and @xmath0-rays is @xmath23 g @xmath102 above 10 eev and the probability of these strongly interacting particles initiating air showers deeper than 1500 g @xmath102 is negligibly small .",
    "thus , showers starting deep in the atmosphere must be produced by penetrating particles such as neutrinos .",
    "large neutrino detectors for measuring hecr air showers using the air fluorescence technique , such as the high resolution fly s eye now under construction  @xcite or the planned japanese telescope array  @xcite will have the potential to search for deeply penetrating showers ( dps ) initiated by neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "their resolution of measurement of the atmospheric depth at which the shower has its maximum particle density is expected to be less than 30 g @xmath102 and the discrimination between dps and the regular air showers would be relatively straightforward .",
    "a possible contamination by a potential background of dps , secondary showers that result from tau lepton decays deep in the atmosphere or from @xmath0-ray bremsstrahlung by muons , has been estimated to be less than @xmath103 for 10 years observation by a typical fluorescence detector .",
    "hence uhe neutrino astronomy with air fluorescence detectors is not background limited  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a giant surface array such as the proposed pierre auger project  @xcite also has significant sensitivity for neutrino detection by search for horizontal air showers . the recently proposed satellite observatory concept for an orbiting wide - angle light collector ( owl )",
    "@xcite would increase the sensitivity to horizontal air showers by at least another order of magnitude .",
    "detection rates can be obtained by folding the predicted fluxes with the product of the charged current neutrino - nucleon cross section for which we use the recent parametrization @xmath104 @xcite , and the acceptance @xmath101 . since the astrophysical `` background '' from other sources of uhe neutrinos , most notably active galactic nuclei and gamma ray bursts  @xcite , and the secondary neutrinos produced by photopion production by hecr  @xcite , is expected to be negligible above 10 eev , we present integral event rates for neutrinos above 10 eev in fig  [ fig : f5 ] for the viable hecr explaining td models from tab .",
    "[ tab : t1 ] .",
    "we furthermore assume an acceptance scaling as @xmath105 which seems to be implied by experimental studies .    for a given @xmath8 , the maximum of the neutrino event rates over all decay modes except the ones only involving neutrinos",
    "is typically reached for the pure quark decay modes , except for @xmath54 gev , where the @xmath106 mode produces the highest rates . as can be seen from fig .",

    "this is not surprising because for all decay modes except the ones only involving neutrinos , @xmath111 .",
    "the constraint eq .",
    "( [ r2 ] ) is independent of the ff and arises from comparing the energy content in neutrinos and @xmath0-rays , the latter being bounded from above by the egret measurement .",

    "( [ r2 ] ) is not applicable because @xmath112 , and the relevant quantity is the fraction of energy produced as secondary @xmath0-rays instead . as can be seen from fig .",

    "apart from the decay spectra and rates , the uncertainty of flux predictions in td scenarios is governed by astrophysical uncertainties , mainly the universal radio background and the large scale extragalactic magnetic field .",
    "our calculations show , however , that for most combinations of likely values for these astrophysical parameters and the energy scale of new physics , there are possible decay modes and fragmentation functions that lead to scenarios explaining the highest energy cosmic rays above the gzk cutoff , and some of them even down to @xmath75 eev , without violating observational constraints on @xmath0-ray and neutrino fluxes . for example , an x particle of mass @xmath118 gev decaying into quarks with a fragmentation function motivated by supersymmetry can explain cosmic rays above @xmath82 eev .",
