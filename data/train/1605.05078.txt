    "mildly super - eddington intermittent accretion may significantly ease the problem of assembling the massive black holes when the universe was young @xcite .",
    "furthermore , high - redshift quasars , such as the known blazars at @xmath9 @xcite , may have powerful jet , which provide a means by which the black hole accretes at a rate that breaks the eddington limit @xcite .",
    "the extended lobes produced by jets may be strong in x - ray , rather than in radio , as the dramatic @xmath10 boosts in the energy density of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) causes inverse compton scattering to dominate energy losses of relativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "x - ray observation of 01 provides a crucial test for understanding the formation of the most massive black holes in the early universe . in this letter",
    "we report our exploratory  observation of this ultraluminous quasar . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt the @xmath11 cosmology parameters from planck collaboration ( 2014 ) : @xmath12 = 0.315 , @xmath13 = 0.685 , and @xmath14 = 67.3 km s@xmath3 .",

    "the total integration time is 14.8 ks .",
    "the target was positioned on the acis - s3 chip , which was operated in time - exposure mode , with faint telemetry format .",
    "the data were processed with standard ciao version 4.7 @xcite , and only events with grades of 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 were considered in the analysis .",
    "no background flares are present in the observation .",
    "we restrict to the derived x - ray counts in the observed - frame of 0.5 - 7 kev , considering the increasingly uncertain quantum efficiency of acis at lower energies and the steeply increasing background at higher energies .",
    "we first carried out source detection with ciao task wavdetect using wavelet transforms ( with wavelet scale sizes of 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 pixels ) and a false - positive probability threshold of 10@xmath21 .",

    "an x - ray source is detected with 7.9@xmath232.8 net counts ( figure[fig1 ] ) .",
    "this source is classified as a galaxy in the sdss dr12 catalog with photometric redshift of 0.52@xmath230.13 @xcite , therefore it is likely to be a low luminosity agn in the foreground .",

    "while , due to the limited source counts of 14 to 15 , no conclusive result is returned .",
    "we then manually extract the photometry of 01   and found 14 counts within a 3 pixel ( @xmath27 ) radius aperture , which corresponds to 94.7% and 89.2% of the encircled energy fraction in 0.5 - 2 kev and 2 - 7 kev , respectively .",
    "there is one more count detected at energy of 1.73 kev within the 4 pixel radius aperture ( figure[fig1 ] ) . according to the point - spread function at the source position ,",

    "that is , the chance of this photon belong to the quasar 01 is 14%-36% .",
    "thus for 01  we restrict subsequent analysis to the detected photons within the 3 pixel radius aperture .",
    "the average background level , estimated from an annulus in the source position with inner and outer radii of 15 and 20 arcsec , in an aperture of the source size is 0.06 in 0.5 - 2 kev and 0.05 counts in 2 - 7 kev .    for 01 , the full - band ( 0.5 - 7 kev ) x - ray counts are 13.9@xmath28 , with 11.9@xmath29 in soft band ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) and 2.0@xmath30 in hard band ( 2 - 7 kev ) .",
    "the errors of the x - ray counts were computed according to @xcite .",
    "the hardness ratio , estimated with bayesian method @xcite , is @xmath31 , indicating that the x - ray spectrum of 01  is soft .",

    "the spectrum is grouped with a minimum of 2 counts per bin .",
    "given that there is only @xmath33 net counts , we fitted the spectrum using xspec with a simple power law model and fixed galactic absorption .",
    "the c - statistic ( cstat ) was used due to the limited photon counts ( cash 1979 ) .",
    "the best fit photon index is @xmath4 = 3.03@xmath5 , with cstat = 8.31 for 5 degrees of freedom .",
    "we also perform montecarlo simulations using the exposure time and response matrices , and fit the simulated one thousand spectra with the same model as above .",
    "the value of inferred photon index is consistent with that from hardness ratio and best fit , with mean value of 3.13 and standard deviation of 0.71 .",
    "the best fit results and confidence curve for the photon index are shown in figure[fig2 ] . as a comparison",
    ", we also show the fitted spectrum with fixed photon index of 2.0 , the typical value found for quasars . from the data to model ratios we can see that the model with soft spectral index of 3.03 improves the fitting at the most soft and hard energy bands .",

    "we label the detected energy and receiving time of each photon in figure[fig3 ] .",
    "there are 4 photons detected between 1.207 kev and 1.228 kev .",
    "this unusual feature causes the significant residual at @xmath341.2 kev in the spectral fitting ( figure 2 ) .",

    "there are 9 photons detected in the first 3 ks bin , while in the middle 6 ks interval no photon is detected , with 99% confidence upper limit of 4.605 @xcite .",
    "we first test the variation by analyzing the photon arrival time using the gregory - loredo algorithm @xcite with ciao tool glvary .",
    "the returned variability probability is p@xmath35 0.967 , and the variability index is 6 from the test .",
    "we then test the chance for a random event of detecting 9 photons in one of the five bins for the total 14 photons with simulation .",
    "the chance is 186 in the 10@xmath36 simulated light curves , corresponding to the probability of 0.019% .",
    "longer exposure observations are needed to investigate this possible variability .    , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to investigate the broad band properties of 01 we calculate the x - ray - to - optical spectral energy distribution parameter , @xmath37 , the slope of a nominal power law between 2500   and 2 kev in the rest frame [ = 0.384@xmath1log@xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the flux density at 2 kev and @xmath40 is the flux density at 2500  ] . for 01 ,",
    "rest frame 2500  moves to the near - infrared at 18250   in the observed frame , falling in the gap between h and k bands as shown in figure 3 in @xcite . using the ultraviolet - optical continuum slope measured in @xcite we estimate the flux density at 2500   to be 3.04@xmath23 0.45@xmath41 erg s@xmath3 @xmath19 @xmath3 .",
    "an energy of 2 kev in the rest frame of 01 corresponds to 0.273 kev in the observed frame .",
    "this energy is poorly sampled by acis .",
    "we compute the 0.273 kev flux and the uncertainty from the best fit power law model in xspec spectral fitting .",
    "this yields a value for  of @xmath42 , with errors dominated by the uncertainty of the rest - frame 2 kev flux .",
    "the ultraluminous quasar 01  is strongly detected in our exploratory  observation with @xmath3414 counts , we find that the x - ray properties of this quasar to be unusual in several aspects .    first , there is a hint of extended emission , and this feature comes from photons in relatively soft energy bands .",
    "as first proposed in @xcite , relativistic electrons in powerful jetted objects with lorentz factor @xmath43 can upscatter cmb photons into the soft x - ray band .",
    "deeper xmm - newton observation , which has much higher soft x - ray sensitivity compared to , would be ideal to investigate the possibility of this extended emission .",
    "second , the x - ray spectrum of 01 is very soft with inferred photon index of 3.03@xmath5 , where the mean value of the x - ray photon index found in the samples of low- and high - redshift quasars is 1.89 @xmath44 2.19 ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although there are still debates about whether the x - ray spectrum of high - redshift quasars significantly differs from that of quasars at lower redshifts @xcite , we note that the highest redshift quasar ulas j1120 + 0641 may also exhibits a soft x - ray spectrum with photon index of @xmath45 ( * ? ?",
    "* see moretti et al .",
    "2014 for a different value of inferred @xmath4 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the soft x - ray spectrum is an indication that the central massive black holes at early epochs are growing at high accretion rate @xcite .",
    "the inferred @xmath4 can be used as an estimator of @xmath46 by using the linear correlation between @xmath4 and log(@xmath46 ) , where @xmath47 is bolometric luminosity and @xmath48 is eddington luminosity @xcite . using different relations presented in the literatures , we find that the corresponding @xmath46 for 01 has minimum value of 6 @xcite , and can be significantly higher ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "if those relations did apply to 01 , it could be accreting at significantly above the eddington rate .",
    "mildly super - eddington accretion corresponds to a shorter e - folding timescale for black hole mass growth , which can ease the problem of assembling massive black holes out of stellar - mass seeds at early times even in the case of intermittent accretion @xcite .",
    "third , 01  has a relatively higher x - ray to optical flux ratio , compared to those found in other quasars of comparable ultraviolet luminosity ( figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "it is well established that the x - ray - to - optical power - law slope parameter  of quasars significantly correlate with the ultraviloet 2500   monochromatic luminosity ( @xmath49 , steffen et al .",
    "2006 ; just et al .",
    "according to the @xmath49 relation given by just et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , a value of  @xmath50 is expected for 01 , compared to be the value of  = @xmath42 obtained from  observation .",
    "the observed large  could be due to the inferred steep x - ray photon index , which is still not well constrained based on current s / n of the data .",
    "while , even if we adopt a flat x - ray spectral shape with the x - ray photon index of nominal 2.0 to infer the rest - frame 2 kev flux for 01 , the derived  is @xmath51 , is still larger than the average and is at upper envelop of the observed  values at the comparable ultraviolet luminosity ( figure[fig4 ] ) .",
    "however , the value of  for 01  is still in the range of the ones found in the quasars at low to median redshift , supporting the no evolution of  with redshift @xcite     relation , and the dashed line marks the devision between x - ray weak and x - ray normal quasars adopted in @xcite . for 01",
    "the two red stars represent the values of  derived with x - ray photon index of 3.03 and 2.0 , respectively .",
    "[ fig4],scaledwidth=50.0% ]    01  is a weak - line quasar with rest - frame equivalent width of the ly@xmath52 @xcite .",
    "weak - line quasars ( wlqs ) are a subclass of radio - quiet quasars that have almost extremely weak or undetectable emission lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the nature of wlqs is still under investigation , although a number of hypotheses have been proposed , such as abnormal broad emission line region with significant deficit of line - emitting gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or in an early evolutionary stage of formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a soft ionising spectral energy distribution due to intrinsic x - ray weakness ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or due to small - scale absorption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "significant fractions ( @xmath53 ) of the wlqs are distinctly x - ray weak compared to typical quasars @xcite .",
    "our results demonstrate that 01  is definitely not an x - ray weak wlq , as shown in figure[fig4 ] .",
    "if we interpret 01  in the scenario proposed by wu et al.(2012 ) and luo et al.(2015 ) , in which they unified x - ray weak and x - ray normal wlqs by orientation effect with proposed ` shielding - gas ' , this quasar should be viewed at a small inclination angle .    finally , we detect a hint of x - ray variability for 01  within our exposure . for high - redshift quasar at this luminosity , its x - ray flux is not expected to vary at the timescale of @xmath54 ks unless beaming is involved .",
    "given that the light crossing time of even the schwarzschild radius for a 12 billion @xmath55 black hole is much longer than 10 ks , the x - ray flux of 01 is not expected to vary in our observations unless strong beaming is involved .",
    "deeper xmm - newton observation will help to better constrain the spectral features , probe the extended emission and investigate the variability on both short ( @xmath341 hr ) and longer ( months to year ) timescales for this ultraluminous quasar .",
