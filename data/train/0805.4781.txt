    "<S> we discuss the production of charmonium in nuclear collisions within the framework of the statistical hadronization model . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the model reproduces very well the availble data at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> we provide predictions for the lhc energy where , dependently on the charm production cross section , a dramatically different behaviour of charmonium production as a function of centrality might be expected . </S>",
    "<S> we extend our predictions for charm production towards the threshold energies , where charm is expected to be measured at the future fair facility .    </S>",
    "<S> charmonium production is considered , since the original proposal more than 20 years ago about its suppression in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite , an important probe to determine the degree of deconfinement reached in the fireball produced in ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions . in the original scenario of j/@xmath0 suppression via debye screening @xcite it is assumed that the charmonia are rapidly formed in initial hard collisions but are subsequently destroyed in the qgp ( see an update in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    in recent publications @xcite </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that the data on j/@xmath0 and @xmath1 production in nucleus - nucleus collisions at the sps ( @xmath2 gev ) and rhic ( @xmath3=200 gev ) energies can be well described within the statistical hadronization model proposed in @xcite and have provided predictions for the lhc energy ( @xmath3=5.5 tev ) and for energies close to threshold ( @xmath4 gev ) .    in our statistical hadronization model ( shm ) </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we assume that the charm quarks are produced in primary hard collisions and that their total number stays constant until hadronization at chemical freeze - out . </S>",
    "<S> another important element is thermal equilibration in the qgp , at least near the critical temperature , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of elliptic flow of j/@xmath0 will be a crucial check of this scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the model has the following input parameters : i ) the charm production cross section in pp collisions , taken either from nlo pqcd calculations @xcite or from experiment @xcite ; ii ) characteristics at chemical freeze - out : temperature , @xmath6 , baryochemical potential , @xmath7 , and volume corresponding to one unit of rapidity @xmath8 , extracted from thermal fits of non - charmed hadrons @xcite .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ aa_fig1 ] we present the rapidity dependence of the nuclear modification factor @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> while earlier @xcite we have compared data @xcite to our model predictions for the pqcd charm production cross section @xcite ( dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ aa_fig1 ] ) , we use here as alternative the charm cross section as measured by phenix in pp collisions @xcite and consider in addition shadowing for au - au collsions as extracted from recent dau data @xcite ( assuming teh deviation of @xmath10 from unity is due to shadowing ) . </S>",
    "<S> also in this case , our model describes the observed suppression and its rapidity dependence . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum of @xmath9 at midrapidity is in our model due to the enhanced generation of charmonium around mid - rapidity , determined by the rapidity dependence of the charm production cross section . in this sense , the above result constitutes strong evidence for the statistical generation of j/@xmath0 at chemical freeze - out .     for two centrality classes . </S>",
    "<S> the data from the phenix experiment @xcite ( symbols with errors ) are compared to calculations ( lines , see text ) . </S>",
    "<S> the shaded area corresponds to calculations for the lower limit of the charm cross section as measured by phenix @xcite , with our shadowing scenario . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the centrality dependence of @xmath9 at midrapidity is shown in the left panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ aa_fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations approach the value in pp collisions around @xmath11=50 , which corresponds to an assumed minimal volume for the creation of qgp of 400 @xmath12 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the model reproduces very well the decreasing trend versus centrality seen in the rhic data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that , in our model , the centrality dependence of the nuclear modification factor arises entirely as a consequence of the still rather moderate rapidity density of initially produced charm quark pairs at rhic ( @xmath13=1.6 for central collisions , using the fonll charm production cross section @xcite ) . at the much higher lhc energy the charm production cross section ( including shadowing in pbpb collisions @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> is expected to be about an order of magnitude larger . as a result , the opposite trend as a function of centrality is predicted , with @xmath9 exceeding unity for central collisions . a significantly larger enhancement of about a factor of 2 is obtained if the charm production cross section is two times larger than presently assumed , as seen in the right panel of fig </S>",
    "<S> .  [ aa_fig2 ] , where we show the @xmath14 production relative to the number of initially produced @xmath15 pairs .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     </S>",
    "<S> one of the motivations for the study of charm production at low energies was the expectation @xcite to provide , by a measurement of d - meson production near threshold , information on their possible in - medium modification near the phase boundary . however , the cross section @xmath16 is governed by the mass of the charm quark @xmath17 gev , which is much larger than any soft quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) scale such as @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we expect no medium effects on this quantity . </S>",
    "<S> the much later formed d - mesons , or other charmed hadrons , may well change their mass in the hot medium . </S>",
    "<S> whatever the medium effects may be , they can , because of the charm conservation , @xmath19 , in first order only lead to a redistribution of charm quarks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this argument is essentially model - independent and applies equally at all energies . </S>",
    "<S> this is demonstrated in the right panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ aa_fig3 ] , where we plot the relative change of the yields for different in - medium mass scenarios ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for details and references therein ) compared to the case of vacuum masses . in contrast , the yields of charmonia do vary and this is more prominent at threshold energies ( see fig .  [ aa_fig3 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the statistical hadronization model describes well the measured decrease with centrality and the rapidity dependence of @xmath9 at rhic energy . </S>",
    "<S> extrapolation to lhc energy leads , contrary to the observations at rhic , to @xmath9 increasing with collision centrality . </S>",
    "<S> the increasing importance at lower energies of @xmath20 production was discussed and provides a challenge for future experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that possible modifications of charmed hadrons in the hot hadronic medium do not lead to measurable changes in the cross sections for production of hadrons with open charm . </S>",
    "<S> a possible influence of medium effects can be seen , however , in the yields of charmonium . </S>"
