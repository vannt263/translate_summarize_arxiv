    "random graphs often appear and have been studied in various fields of natural science and engineering .",
    "a recent interest in their applications is generating expander graphs  @xcite , regular graphs that shows high connectivity and homogeneity .",
    "such graphs have important applications in designing networks of computers  @xcite , infrastructures  @xcite , and real and artificial neurons  @xcite .",
    "a way to define and generate expanders is maximization of the spectral gap @xmath1 , which is defined as the difference between the largest eigenvalue and the second largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a graph .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite numerically maximized the spectral gap by simulated annealing and generated examples of these graphs .",
    "however , in designing networks , we are also interested in quantitative properties ; specifically how the probability of large spectral gap graphs behaves when the size @xmath2 of graphs increases .    in this paper",
    "we apply a method based on multicanonical monte carlo  @xcite to the calculation of large deviations in the spectral gap of random graphs .",
    "the method can be regarded as an extension of the method introduced in  @xcite ; in  @xcite , large deviations in the largest eigenvalue of random matrices are computed by a similar method .",
    "multicanonical monte carlo enables us to estimate tails of the distribution whose probability is very small and can not be computed by naive random sampling . by using the proposed method",
    ", we estimate the distribution of the spectral gap of random 3-regular graphs and quantify the probability @xmath3 that the spectral gap is larger than a given @xmath4 ; when @xmath5 , it is shown that @xmath6 for large @xmath2 .",
    "an undirected graph is described by the corresponding adjacency matrix @xmath7 , whose entries are defined by @xmath8 here we denote eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix by @xmath9 . in the case of @xmath10-regular graphs",
    ", @xmath7 has the trivial largest eigenvalue @xmath11 , therefore we assume @xmath12 the difference @xmath13 between the largest eigenvalue and the largest non - trivial eigenvalue of @xmath7 is called `` spectral gap '' and takes a non - zero value if the corresponding graph is connected .",
    "we are interested in tails of the distribution of the spectral gap . in the case of regular graphs , alon and boppana  ( see  @xcite ) proved an asymptotic lower bound of the largest non - trivial eigenvalue @xmath14 as @xmath15 assuming that the limit exists , this gives an asymptotic upper bound for the spectral gap as @xmath16 .",
    "graphs with @xmath17 are called `` ramanujan graphs ''  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "friedman  @xcite proved that for @xmath18 and for any constant @xmath19 `` most '' random @xmath10-regular graphs have @xmath14 that satisfies @xmath20 as @xmath21 .",
    "these results indicate that the peak of the distribution of @xmath22 is located near @xmath23 for large @xmath2 .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the distribution around this peak using naive random sampling .",
    "none of these studies , however , discusses extreme tails of the distribution of @xmath24 or @xmath1 , which is the main subject of this paper .",
    "here , we will give a brief explanation of multicanonical monte carlo .",
    "the aim of this method is to estimate the density of states @xmath25 defined by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the dirac @xmath27-function and @xmath28 denotes a multiple integral in the space of matrix @xmath29 .",
    "we define the weight by @xmath30 as a function of @xmath1 , a key quantity of this method .",
    "when a weight function @xmath30 is given , we can generate samples from the distribution defined by the weight using the metropolis algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the essential idea is to tune the weight function @xmath30 so as to produce a flat histogram of @xmath1 .",
    "after we find a appropriate weight function @xmath31 that gives a flat histogram , an approximate value of the density of states is estimated by @xmath32 . to obtain this @xmath31 , we modify the weight function step - by - step through the metropolis simulation using the current guess of the weight function @xmath30 .",
    "there are several ways to modify the function @xmath30 . among them , a method proposed by wang and landau  @xcite is most successful and used in this study . for a more accurate estimate of the density of states ,",
    "we calculate a histogram @xmath33 by performing a long simulation with fixed @xmath31 .",
    "then @xmath25 is estimated by @xmath34 and the probability distribution @xmath35 of @xmath1 is obtained by @xmath36 .",
    "practically , we calculate the density @xmath35 only in a prescribed interval @xmath37 .",
    "details of the implementation of the metropolis algorithm are as follows .",
    "the simulation starts from an arbitrary @xmath10-regular graph with the desired number of vertices @xmath2 . in each step , a candidate @xmath38 is generated by rewiring edges in the way used in  @xcite , where the degree @xmath10 of each vertex is not changed ; a pair of links @xmath39 and @xmath40 that satisfy @xmath41 is selected and rewired as @xmath42 .",
    "then the spectral gap @xmath1 of a candidate is calculated by the householder method and accept / reject decision of the transition from the current state @xmath43 to @xmath38 is made by comparing the metropolis ratio @xmath44 with a random number uniformly distributed in @xmath45 $ ] . a candidate with @xmath46 , indicating a disconnected graph , is always rejected , hence an ensemble of connected random @xmath10-regular graphs is sampled .",
    "of the spectral gap of random 3-regular graphs .",
    "the density at @xmath1 plotted in the vertical axis is obtained from the probability in a small bin around @xmath1 of a fixed width ; the values of them depend on the bin width in the right tail of the distribution , because discreteness of the spectra becomes relevant there .",
    "the arrows indicate @xmath47 ; graphs whose @xmath1 is above this value are ramanujan . ]    using the proposed method , we estimate the distribution of the spectral gap of random 3-regular graphs with the number of vertices @xmath48 .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows graphs with the largest spectral gap for @xmath49 and @xmath50 found in the simulations . in figure  [ fig:2 ] , we show @xmath35 of random 3-regular graphs with the number of vertices @xmath51 ; the computational time is 7 hours for @xmath52 and 251 hours for @xmath53 using a core of intel xeon x5365 . as @xmath2 increases",
    ", the probability density becomes sharper and the peak becomes closer to around @xmath54 , which is consistent with a theoretical estimate  @xcite and a numerical experiment  @xcite .",

    ", we calculate the distribution of the spectral gap @xmath1 and the probability @xmath62 for random 3-regular graphs .",
    "while naive random sampling provides reasonable estimates of @xmath62 only when @xmath4 is around the peak of the distribution @xmath35 , the proposed method enables us to estimate @xmath62 in a wide region of @xmath4 including extreme tails of the distribution .",
