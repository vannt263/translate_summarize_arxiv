    "in the 60 s skorokhod @xcite formulated the following problem : finding a stopping time @xmath0 of a standard brownian motion @xmath1 such that @xmath2 is distributed according to a given probability law @xmath3 .",
    "many solutions to this problem have been found over the past 50 years via a number of different methods bridging analysis and probability ( for a survey one may refer for example to @xcite ) . in recent years",
    "the study of skorokhod embedding was boosted by the discovery of its applications to model independent finance and a survey of these results can also be found in @xcite .    in this work",
    "we focus on the so - called rost s solution of the embedding ( see @xcite ) and our main contribution is a new fully probabilistic proof of its connection to a problem of optimal stopping .",
    "one of the key differences in our approach compared to other existing proofs of this result ( @xcite and @xcite ) is that we tackle the optimal stopping problem directly .",
    "moreover , we rely only on stochastic calculus rather than using classical pde methods , as in @xcite , or viscosity theory , as in @xcite .    here",
    "we consider rost s solutions expressed in terms of first hitting times of the time - space brownian motion @xmath4 to a set usually called _ reversed barrier _ @xcite . a purely probabilistic construction of rost s barrier relevant to the present work was recently found in @xcite in a very general setting .",
    "cox and peskir @xcite proved that given a probability measure @xmath3 one can find a unique couple of left continuous functions @xmath5 , with @xmath6 increasing and @xmath7 decreasing , such that @xmath1 stopped at the stopping time @xmath8 is distributed according to @xmath3 .",
    "the curves @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the boundaries of rost s reversed barrier set and the stopping time @xmath9 fulfils a number of optimality properties , e.g.  it has the smallest truncated expectation among all stopping times realising the same embedding .",
    "the optimal stopping problem object of our study is pointed out in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 17 ) and it was originally linked to rost s embedding via pde methods by mcconnell ( * ? ? ?",
    "let @xmath10 , let @xmath11 and @xmath3 be probability measures with cumulative distributions @xmath12 and @xmath13 , denote @xmath14 a brownian motion and consider the optimal stopping problem @xmath15 where @xmath0 is a stopping time of @xmath14 . in this paper we prove that under mild assumptions on @xmath3 and @xmath11 ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : sett ] ) it is optimal in to stop @xmath16 at the first exit time from an open set @xmath17\\times\\rr$ ] ( continuation set ) which is bounded from above and from below by two right - continuous , monotone functions of time ( one of these could be infinite ) . for each @xmath10",
    "we denote @xmath18\\times\\rr\\big\\}\\setminus\\cc_t$ ] ( stopping set ) and we construct a set @xmath19 as the extension to @xmath20 of the time reversal of the family @xmath21 .",
    "then we show that such @xmath22 is a rost s barrier in the sense that if @xmath23 is another brownian motion ( independent of @xmath14 ) with initial distribution @xmath11 , the first hitting time @xmath24 of @xmath25 to the set @xmath22 gives @xmath26 .",
    "our study was inspired by the work of mcconnell @xcite .",
    "he studied a free - boundary problem , motivated by a version of the two sided stefan problem , where certain boundary conditions were given in a generalised sense that involved the measures @xmath3 and @xmath11 used in .",
    "his results of existence uniqueness and regularity of the solution relied mostly upon pde methods and some arguments from the theory of markov processes .",
    "mcconnell showed that the free - boundaries of his problem are the boundaries of a rost s reversed barrier embedding the law @xmath3 ( analogously to the curves @xmath6 and @xmath7 of @xcite ) and he provided some insights as to how these free - boundaries should also be optimal stopping boundaries for problem .    in the present paper we adopt a different point of view and begin by performing a probabilistic analysis of the optimal stopping problem .",
    "we characterise its optimal stopping boundaries and carry out a deep study of the regularity of its value function .",
    "it is important to notice that the second derivative of @xmath27 in only exists in the sense of measures ( except under the restrictive assumption of @xmath3 and @xmath11 absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure ) and therefore our study of the optimal stopping problem naturally involves fine properties of brownian motion s local time ( via the occupation time formula ) .",
    "this feature seems fairly new in the existing literature on finite time - horizon optimal stopping problems and requires some new arguments for the study of .",
    "our analysis of the regularity of the value function @xmath28 of shows that its time derivative @xmath29 is continuous on @xmath30 ( see proposition [ prop : cont - vt ] ) although its space derivative @xmath31 may not be .",
    "the proof of the continuity of @xmath29 is entirely probabilistic and to the best of our knowledge it represents a novelty in this literature and it is a result is of independent interest .    building on the results concerning problem we then provide a simple proof of the connection with rost s embedding ( see proof of theorem [ thm : sk ] ) .",
    "we would like to stress that our line of arguments is different to the one in @xcite and it is only based on probability and stochastic calculus .",
    "moreover our results extend those of @xcite relative to the skorokhod embedding by considering target measures @xmath3 that may have atoms ( mcconnell instead only looked at continuous measures ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the connection between problem and rost s embedding hinges on the probabilistic representation of the time derivative of the value function of ( see proposition [ prop : ut ] ) .",
    "it turns out that @xmath29 can be expressed in terms of the transition density of @xmath32 killed when leaving the continuation set @xmath33 ; then symmetry properties of the heat kernel allow us to rewrite @xmath29 as the transition density of @xmath25 killed when hitting the rost s reversed barrier @xmath22 ( see lemma [ lemma : hunt ] .",
    "mcconnell obtained the same result via potential theoretic and pde arguments ) . the latter result and it s formula",
    "are then used to complete the connection in theorem [ thm : sk ] .",
    "one should notice that probabilistic connections between optimal stopping and skorokhod embedding are not new in the literature and there are examples relative for instance to the azma - yor s embedding @xcite ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite among others ) and to the vallois embedding @xcite ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for recent developments of connections between control theory , transport theory and skorokhod embedding one may refer to @xcite and @xcite among others .",
    "our work instead is more closely related to the work of cox and wang @xcite ( see also @xcite ) where they show that starting from the rost s solution of the skorokhod embedding one can provide the value function of an optimal stopping problem whose optimal stopping time is the hitting time of the rost s barrier .",
    "their result holds for martingales under suitable assumptions and clearly the optimal stopping problem that they find reduces to in the simpler case of brownian motion .",
    "an important difference between this work and @xcite is that the latter starts from the rost s barrier and constructs the optimal stopping problem , here instead we argue reverse .",
    "methodologies are also very different as @xcite relies upon viscosity theory or weak solutions of variational inequalities .",
    "results in @xcite and @xcite have been recently expanded in @xcite where viscosity theory and reflected fbsdes have been used to establish the equivalence between solutions of certain obstacle problems and root s ( as well as rost s ) solutions of the skorokhod embedding problem .",
    "finally we would like to mention that here we address the question posed in ( * ? ? ? * rem .",
    "4.4 ) of finding a probabilistic explanation for the correspondence between hitting times of rost s barriers and suitable optimal stopping times .",
    "when this work was being completed we have learned of a work by cox , obj and touzi @xcite where optimal stopping and a time reversal technique are also used to construct root s barriers for the skorokhod embedding problem with multiple marginals . in the latter paper",
    "the authors study directly an optimal stopping problem associated by @xcite to root s embedding .",
    "they prove that the corresponding stopping set is indeed the root barrier for a suitable target law @xmath3 and , using an iterative scheme , they extend the result to embeddings with multiple marginals .",
    "this is done via a sequence of optimal stopping problems nested into one another .",
    "the approach in @xcite is probabilistic but the methods are different to the ones described here .",
    "our results rely on @xmath34 regularity properties of the value function for whereas , in @xcite , only continuity of the value function is obtained .",
    "the connection between optimal stopping and root s embedding found in @xcite uses an approximation scheme starting from finitely supported measures and it holds for target measures @xmath3 which are centered and with finite first moment .",
    "the latter assumptions are not needed here and we deal directly with a general @xmath3 without relying on approximations .",
    "root and rost embedding are somehow the time - reversal of one another and therefore our work and @xcite nicely complement each other .",
    "although it should be possible to extend our results and methods to a multi - marginal case , this is not a trivial task and is left for future research .",
    "the present paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : sett ] we provide the setting and give the main results . in section [ sec :",
    "optst ] we completely analyse the optimal stopping problem and its value function whereas section [ sec : sk ] is finally devoted to the proof of the link to rost s embedding . a technical appendix collects some results and concludes the paper .",

    "on the other hand assumption ( d.1 ) guarantees that for any @xmath10 the continuation set of problem is connected ( see also the rigorous formulation below ) .",
    "although ( d.1 ) is not necessary for our main results to hold , the study of general non - connected continuation sets would require a case - by - case analysis .",
