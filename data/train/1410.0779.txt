    "borexino is a unique detector able to perform measurement of solar neutrinos fluxes in the energy region around 1 mev or below because of its low level of radioactive background .",
    "after several years of efforts and tests with the prototype ctf detector the design goals have been reached and for some of the radioactive isotopes ( internal @xmath28u and @xmath29th ) largely exceeded .",
    "the low background is an essential condition to perform the measurement : in fact solar neutrinos induced scintillations can not be distinguished on an event by event analysis from the ones due to background .",
    "the energy shape of the solar neutrino is the main signature that has to be recognized in the experimental energy spectrum by a suitable fit procedure that includes the expected signal and the background .",
    "the basic signature for the mono - energetic 0.862 mev @xmath0be neutrinos is the compton - like edge of the recoil electrons at 665 kev .",
    "the detector is located deep underground ( approximately 3800 m of water equivalent , mwe ) in the hall c of the laboratori nazionali del gran sasso ( italy ) , where the muon flux is suppressed by a factor of 10@xmath30 .",
    "the main goal of the experiment was the detection of the monochromatic neutrinos that are emitted in the electron capture of @xmath0be in the sun with 5% precision .",
    "sketch of the borexino detector .",
    "the base of the dome - like structure is 18 m in diameter . ]",
    "the complete up to date technical description of the borexino detector has been reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the detector is schematically depicted in fig.[detector ] .",
    "the inner part is an unsegmented stainless steel sphere ( sss ) that is both the container of the scintillator and the mechanical support of the photomultipliers . within this sphere ,",
    "two nylon vessels separate the scintillator volume in three shells of radii 4.25 m , 5.50 m and 6.85 m , the latter being the radius of the sss itself .",
    "the inner nylon vessel ( iv ) contains the liquid scintillator solution , namely pc ( pseudocumene , 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene c@xmath31h@xmath32(ch@xmath32)@xmath32 ) as a solvent and the fluor ppo ( 2,5- diphenyloxazole , c@xmath33h@xmath34no ) as a solute at a concentration of 1.5",
    "g / l ( 0.17% by weight ) .",
    "the second and the third shell contain pc with a small amount ( 5",
    "g / l ) of dmp ( dimethylphthalate ) that is added as a light quencher in order to further reduce the scintillation yield of pure pc . the pc / ppo solution adopted as liquid scintillator satisfies specific requirements : high scintillation yield ( @xmath35 photons / mev ) , high light transparency ( the mean free path is typically 8 m ) and fast decay time ( @xmath363 ns ) , all essential for good energy resolution , precise spatial reconstruction , and good discrimination between @xmath37-like events and events due @xmath38 particles . furthermore ,",
    "several conventional petrochemical techniques are feasible to purify the hundred of tons of fluids needed by borexino .",
    "the scintillation light is collected by 2212 photomutipliers ( pmts ) that are uniformly attached to the inner surface of the sss .",
    "all but 384 photomultipliers are equipped with light concentrators that are designed to reject photons not coming from the active scintillator volume , thus reducing the background due to radioactive decays originating in the buffer liquid or @xmath39 s from the pmts .",
    "the tank has a cylindrical base with a diameter of 18 m and a hemispherical top with a maximum height of 16.9 m. the water tank ( wt ) is a powerful shielding against external background ( @xmath39rays and neutrons from the rock ) and is also used as a cherenkov muon counter and muon tracker . the muon flux , although reduced by a factor of @xmath40 by the 3800 m.w.e . depth of the gran sasso laboratory , is of the order of 1 m@xmath41 h@xmath42 , corresponding to about 4000 muons per day crossing the detector .",
    "this flux is well above borexino requirements and a strong additional reduction factor ( about @xmath43 ) is necessary .",
    "therefore the wt is equipped with 208 photomultipliers that collect the cherenkov light emitted by muons in water . in order to maximize the light collection efficiency the sss and the interior of the wt surface",
    "are covered with a layer of tyvek , a white paper - like material made of polyethylene fibers .",
    "the borexino has an excellent energy resolution for its size , this is the result of the high light yield of @xmath44 p.e./mev/2000 pmts .",
    "the energy resolution ( 1@xmath45 ) at the @xmath0be compton edge energy ( 662 kev ) is as low as 44 kev ( or 6.6% ) .",
    "analysis of the borexino data showed that the main goals concerning the natural radioactivity have been achieved .",
    "the contamination of the liquid scintillator with respect to the u / th is at the level of @xmath46 g / g ; the contamination with @xmath47k is at the level of @xmath48g / g ( @xmath49 in natural potassium ) ; the @xmath50c content is @xmath51 g / g with respect to the @xmath52c . among the other contamination sources only @xmath53kr , @xmath54bi and @xmath54po",
    "have been identified . the @xmath53kr counts @xmath360.3 ev / day / tone , it is @xmath37- emitter with 687 kev end - point .",
    "the @xmath54po is the most intense contamination ( with initial activity of 60 counts / day / tone ) , it decays emitting monoenergetic @xmath38 with 5.3 mev energy , the half - life time of the isotope is 134 days .",
    "the residual contaminations do not obscure the expected neutrino signal , the presence of the 862 kev monoenergetic @xmath0be solar neutrino is clearly seen in the experimental spectrum . in such a way , the collaboration succeeded to purify the liquid scintillator from residual natural radioactive isotopes down to the levels much lower than was initially envisaged for the @xmath0be neutrino measurement , which resulted in broadening of the initial scientific scope of the experiment .",
    "the main goal of the experiment was the detection of the monochromatic neutrinos that are emitted in the electron capture of @xmath0be in the sun with 5% precision .",
    "this goal has been achieved during the first stage of the experiment @xcite .",
    "the borexino reported the first measurement of neutrino @xmath55b neutrinos with liquid scintillator detector with a 3 mev threshold on electrons recoil @xcite .",
    "the stability of the detector allowed also to study the day - night effect of the @xmath0be solar neutrino signal , thereby allowing to completely exclude the low solution of the neutrino oscillation based on solar data alone @xcite .",
    "finally , the low background of the detector , the refined analysis on threefold coincidences @xcite and the positronium discrimination method based on the positronium formation study made it possible to explore the 1 - 2 mev region with unprecedented sensitivity .",
    "this led to the first observation of solar neutrinos from the basic pep reaction @xcite .",
    "in addition , the best limit for the cno production in a star has been established . in this way",
    ", borexino has completed direct detection of be-7 , pep and b-8 solar neutrino components thereby providing complete evidence of the transition from msw and vacuum oscillation of the lma solution of the solar neutrino problem ( fig .",
    "[ pee ] ) .",
    "electron neutrino survival probability , three points in this plot are derived from the borexino data . it should be noted that the precision of the be-7 neutrino flux itself is much better than the pee error at the corresponding point , this is related to the solar model uncertainties . ,",
    "one of the goal of the borexino experiment is the measurement of all the solar neutrino fluxes , with the exception of the hep flux , too faint for detection in borexino .",
    "the @xmath0be , pep and @xmath55b ( this last with the lowest threshold to date ) have been already measured , but the experimental uncertainties can be reduced .",
    "in addition borexino will try to measure the pp and cno fluxes .",
    ".[ssmvsdata]ssm predictions and current experimental results [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table [ ssmvsdata ] the solar fluxes measured by borexino so far are compared with the ssm prediction , for low and high metallicity .",
    "the experimental results agree , within the errors , with the ssm predictions , but can not distinguish between the two metallicities , due to the uncertainties of the model and the experimental errors .",
    "it would be useful , at this moment , to recall what the metallicity puzzle is .",
    "the solar surface heavy element abundance has been calculated about ten years ago with a 1d model , which uses data from spectroscopic observations of the elements present in the photosphere ( gs98 @xcite ) .",
    "this model agrees with the helioseismology observations , namely the measurement of the speed of the mechanical waves in the sun .",
    "more recently a 3d hydro - dynamical model ( agss09 @xcite ) of the near - surface solar convection , with improved energy transfer , has changed the z / x ratio with respect to the previous 1d treatment : 0.0178 ( low metallicity ) to be compared with the previous 0.0229 ( high metallicity ) .",
    "the 3d model results perfectly reproduce the observed solar atmospheric line ( atomic and molecular ) profiles and asymmetries , but are in clear disagreement with the helioseismology data . at present",
    "there is no satisfactory solution to this controversy @xcite .",
    "the 1d and the 3d models predict different neutrino fluxes from the various nuclear reactions , as shown in table 1 , where they are compared with the experimental results obtained until now .",
    "as stated above , it is not possible , at present , to discriminate the solutions due to model uncertainties and experimental errors .",
    "a measurement of the cno flux , with reasonable errors , could distinguish between the two models which predict substantially different fluxes .",
    "the pp solar neutrino flux has been never measured directly .",
    "gallex and sage have measured the integrated solar flux from 233 kev , which , together with the borexino @xmath0be neutrino flux measurement and the experimental data on the @xmath55b neutrino flux , can be used to infer the pp neutrino flux with a relatively small uncertainty , once the luminosity constraint is applied ( fig .",
    "[ pee ] ) .",
    "nevertheless a direct experimental observation , which can be compared with the solar luminosity and the ssm prediction , would be an important achievement .",
    "the pp flux measurement is part of the borexino phase 2 program .",
    "improving the @xmath0be flux measurement is one of the goals for borexino phase ii .",
    "the physics goals of this study can be summarized in three main points .",
    "1 .   reduction of the total error ( statistical+systematic ) down to hopefully @xmath363% .",
    "even with such a precision this measurement can not solve unambiguously the metallicity puzzle , because of the uncertainties of the ssm .",
    "the @xmath0be flux measured in phase i falls in between the two predicted flux values , for high and low metallicities , and a smaller uncertainty would not help if this will be the case also for phase ii .",
    "a very precise experimental determination of the @xmath0be flux remains nonetheless an important tool for testing the solar model as well as a remarkable technical achievement .",
    "2 .   in the context of the neutrino physics , the non standard",
    "neutrino interactions are currently debated .",
    "one way to study them is to analyze the shape of the oscillation vacuum - matter transition region . while @xmath0be can not have a conclusive role in this matter ,",
    "it can nevertheless help in restricting the range of the nsi flavor diagonal terms .",
    "it is possible to constraint the nsi parameters studying the @xmath56 elastic scattering .",
    "bounds are imposed by various other experiments on solar , atmospheric and reactor ( anti)neutrinos . but @xmath0be neutrinos have the strong advantage of being mono - energetic ( @xmath55b neutrino detected by the other solar experiments in real time have a continuous energy spectrum ) .",
    "in borexino , the limitation to this analysis comes from the residual background , especially @xmath53kr , and , to lesser extend , @xmath54bi , which can mimic non - zero values of the nsi parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "an increase of statistics does not help much if not accompanied by a reduction of such background .",
    "this is the most important target of opportunity for phase 2 .",
    "the very low @xmath53kr and reasonably low @xmath54bi achieved , make a direct pp measurement a reality . a careful understanding of the spectrum response in the @xmath50c end - point region is crucial , its study is possible through a dedicated effort .",
    "the main problem in the pp - neutrino study is the disentanglement of the very tail of the @xmath50c spectrum ( with possible pile - up ) from the pp- neutrino spectrum .",
    "the feasibility of the measurement is under study .",
    "a direct detection of pp neutrinos would be a spectacular result and would justify the phase ii alone .",
    "the analysis group performed a study of sensitivity to pp solar neutrinos with the current background levels achieved , the expected statistical precision of the pp - neutrino flux measurement is below 10% , the systematics error will be mainly connected with uncertainty of the @xmath59 pile - up spectrum and intensity determination .",
    "the first indication for pep solar neutrinos has been reported by the collaboration @xcite .",
    "the value for the pep interaction rate obtained in phase i ( 590 live - days ) was @xmath60 cpd / day/100 tones , the absence of a pep signal was rejected at 98% c.l .",
    "the current measurement , in conjunction with the ssm ( the uncertainty in the pep flux is as low as 1.2% ) , yields a survival probability of pee = @xmath61 though the uncertainties are far from gaussian .",
    "the precision is dominated by the statistical uncertainty ( about 20% ) , though with more ( background - free ) data , systematic uncertainties ( 10% ) will start to become important .",
    "this is an extremely important result , but shy of the first measurement of pep solar neutrinos .",
    "the addition of a modest batch of data with @xmath54bi reduced at or below 30 counts/(100 ton @xmath62 day ) will result in the first measurement ( 3@xmath45 ) of pep solar neutrinos .",
    "a much prolonged data taking could also result in a 5@xmath45 precision measurement .",
    "the measurement will allow to gauge the survival probability in the immediate proximity of the transition between two different oscillation regimes .",
    "the borexino detector is the first large volume liquid scintillator detector sensitive to the low - energy solar neutrinos .",
    "it possesses a very good energy resolution in comparison to the water cherenkov detectors , what allows to search for the solar @xmath55b neutrinos starting practically from the energies of the so called thallium limit ( maximum energy of @xmath39 rays from the chains of radioactive decay of @xmath29th and @xmath28u ; gamma - quantum with maximum energy e=2.6 mev is emitted in the decay of @xmath63tl ) .",
    "the measurements of the @xmath55b above 2.8 mev has been performed using one year statistics ( 246 days of live- time ) of the borexino data @xcite .",
    "the threshold of 2.8 mev is the lowest achieved so far in the @xmath55b neutrino real - time measurements .",
    "the interest in the neutrino flux measurement with low threshold comes from the peculiar properties of the survival probability in this energy region .",
    "the electron neutrino oscillations at e<2 mev are expected to be driven by the so called vacuum oscillation , and at energies e>5 mev - by resonant matter - enhanced mechanism . the energy region in between has never been investigated in spectrometric regime , and is of particular interest because of the expected smooth transition between the two types of oscillations .",
    "the rate of @xmath55b solar neutrino interaction as measured through their scattering on the target electrons is 0.22@xmath640.04(stat)@xmath640.01(sys ) cpd/100 tons .",
    "this corresponds to an equivalent electron neutrino flux of @xmath65=(2.4@xmath640.4@xmath640.1)@xmath6210@xmath30 cm@xmath41s@xmath42 , as derived from the elastic scattering only , in good agreement with existing measurements and predictions .",
    "the corresponding mean electron neutrino survival probability , assuming the bs07(gs98 ) standard solar model ( high z model ) , is 0.29@xmath640.10 at the effective energy of 8.6 mev .",
    "the ratio between the measured survival probabilities for @xmath0be and @xmath55b is 1.9@xmath45 apart from unity ( see fig.[pee ] ) .",
    "for the first time the presence of a transition between the low energy vacuum - driven and the high - energy matter - enhanced solar neutrino oscillations is confirmed using the data from a single detector , the result is in agreement with the prediction of the msw - lma solution for solar neutrinos .    acquiring more statistics ( of up to 5 years of the calendar time ) the borexino will provide the competitive measurement of the @xmath55b neutrino flux .",
    "the borexino large size and possibility to reconstruct an interaction point ( with a precision of 14  cm at 1 mev energy deposit ) makes it an appropriate tools for searching of sterile neutrinos .",
    "if the oscillation baseline is about 1 m ( which corresponds to @xmath671 ev@xmath68 ) , exposure of the detector to a compact powerful neutrino source should give rise to a typical oscillation picture with dips and rises in the spatial distribution of events density with respect to the source .",
    "right beneath the borexino detector , there is a cubical pit ( side 105 cm ) accessible through a small squared tunnel ( side 95 cm ) that was built at the time of construction with the purpose of housing neutrino sources for calibration purposes . using this tunnel ,",
    "the experiment with neutrino source can be done with no changes to the borexino layout .",
    "the center of the pit is at 8.25 m from the detector center , requiring a relatively high activity of the neutrino source in order to provide detectable effect .",
    "the experiment sox ( for short distance neutrino oscillations with borexino ) @xcite will be carried in three stages with gradually increasing sensitivity :    phase a : :    a @xmath69cr neutrino source of 200 - 400 pbq activity    deployed at 8.25 m from the detector center ( external with respect to    the detector ) ; phase b : :    deploying a @xmath70ce-@xmath70pr antineutrino    source with 2 - 4 pbq activity at 7.15 m from the detector center    ( placed in the detector s water buffer ) ; phase c : :    a similar @xmath70ce-@xmath70pr source placed    right in the center of the detector .",
    "layout of the borexino detector and the approximate location of the neutrino and anti - neutrino sources in the three phases.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    figure 1 shows a schematic layout of the borexino detector and the approximate location of the neutrino and anti - neutrino sources in the three phases .",
    "two types of neutrino sources are considered : the @xmath69cr source and the @xmath70pr based source .",
    "@xmath69cr decays via electron capture into @xmath69v , emitting two neutrino lines of 750 kev ( 90% ) and 430 kev ( 10% ) , while @xmath70pr decays @xmath37 into @xmath70nd with an end ",
    "point of 3 mev ( parent @xmath70ce decays too , but end - point of its @xmath37-decay is below the ibd threshold ) .",
    "the portion of the @xmath70pr spectrum above the 1.8 mev detection threshold is the only of importance for the experiment .",
    "elastic scattering of @xmath71 on electrons induce negligible background .",
    "the source activity of 200 - 400 pbq is challenging , but only a factor 2 - 4 higher than what already done by gallex and sage in the 90 s . the @xmath70ce@xmath70pr experiment in phases",
    "b and c does nt require high source activity .",
    "the phase c is the most sensitive but it can be done only after the shutdown of the solar neutrino program , because it needs modification of the detector .",
    "the phases a and b will not disturb the solar neutrino program of the experiment , which is supposed to continue until the end of 2015 , and do not require any change to borexino hardware .",
    "the challenge for the phase c is constituted by the large background induced by the source in direct contact with the scintillator , that can be in principle tackled thanks to the correlated nature of the @xmath71 signal detection . in phase",
    "b this background , though still present , is mitigated by the shielding of the buffer liquid .",
    "borexino can study short distance neutrino oscillations in two ways : by comparing the detected number of events with expected value ( disappearance technique , or total counts method ) , or by observing the oscillation pattern in the events density over the detector volume ( waves method ) . in the last case the typical oscillations length is of the order",
    "the variations in the survival probability @xmath72 could be seen on the spatial distribution of the detected events as the waves superimposed on the uniformly distributed background .",
    "oscillation parameters can be directly extracted from the analysis of the waves .",
    "the result may be obtained only if the size of the source is small compared to the oscillation length .",
    "the @xmath69cr source will be made by about 10 - 35 kg of highly enriched cr metal chips which have a total volume of about 4 - 10 l. the source linear size will be about 15 - 23 cm , comparable to the spatial resolution of the detector .",
    "the @xmath70ce@xmath70pr source is even more compact .",
    "all simulations shown below takes into account the source size .    in phase a the total counts method sensitivity",
    "is enhanced by exploiting the fact that the life - time of the @xmath69cr is relatively short . in phases",
    "b and c this time - dependent method is not effective because the source life - time is longer ( 411 days ) , but this is compensated by the very low background and by the larger cross - section .",
    "the total counts and waves methods combined together yield a very good sensitivity for both experiments . besides , the wave method is independent on the intensity of the source , on detector efficiency , and is potentially a nice probe for un - expected new physics in the short distance behavior of neutrinos or anti - neutrinos .",
    "the sensitivity of sox with respect to oscillation into sterile neutrino was evaluated with a toy monte carlo .",
    "expected statistical samples ( 2000 events ) were generated for each pair of oscillation parameters .",
    "we assume a period of 15 weeks of stable data taking before the source insertion in order to accurately constrain the background .",
    "the background model includes all known components , identified and accurately measured during the first phase of borexino .",
    "we built the confidence intervals from the mean @xmath73 for each couple of parameters with respect to the non - oscillation scenario .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitivity ] , as one can see fro the figure the reactor anomaly region of interest is mostly covered .",

    "a similar result can be obtained with two irradiations of about 200 pbq if higher intensity turns out to be beyond the technical possibilities .",
    "the single irradiation option is preferable and yields a slightly better signal to noise ratio .",
    "the physics reach for the @xmath70ce@xmath70pr external ( phase b ) and internal ( phase c ) experiments , assuming 2.3 pbq ( 75 kci ) source strength and one and a half year of data taking ) is shown in the same figure ( fig .",

    "such an increase will be made possible by the addition of the scintillating fluor ( ppo ) in the inner buffer region ( presently inert ) of the detector .",
    "we have also conservatively considered exclusion of the innermost sphere of 1.5 m radius from the analysis in order to reject the gamma and bremsstrahlung backgrounds from the source assembly . under all these realistic assumptions ,",

    "borexino achieved its main goal , but is still a challenging detector . due to achieved level of purification ( much higher than it was needed for @xmath0be neutrino detection )",
    "some measurements of solar neutrino fluxes beyond the original program were performed .",

    "borexino is also an ideal detector to test the sterile neutrinos through the disappearance / wave effects .",
    "the proposed staged approach ( @xmath69cr source at the first stage and two @xmath70ce@xmath70pr experiments ) is a comprehensive sterile neutrino search which will either confirm the effect or reject it in a clear and unambiguous way .",
    "in particular , in case of one sterile neutrino with parameters corresponding to the central value of the reactor anomaly , sox will surely discover the effect , prove the existence of oscillations and measure the parameters through the `` oscillometry '' analysis .",
