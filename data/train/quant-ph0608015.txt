    "the goal of quantum key distribution ( qkd ) is to distribute a key between two honest parties , usually called alice and bob , which is provably secure against any eavesdropper eve .",
    "it is assumed that eve is only limited by the laws of physics . from a practical point of view , implementations using coherent states as input signals and variations of homodyne @xcite detection seem to be promising , since they can readily be realized experimentally .",
    "moreover , it has been suggested that homodyne detection can be performed at high repetition rates in continuous variable ( cv ) qkd to boost the secret key rate @xcite .",
    "the security of these schemes has been investigated before @xcite and unconditional security has been proven for losses of up to 1.4 db @xcite .",
    "though advancing our understanding of these schemes , no analysis has been provided that would give an unconditional secure key over channels with higher losses or channels imposing excess noise on the observed quadratures . in this article",
    "we will present an analysis that derives a security result under the assumption of collective attacks and the observation of gaussian noise .",
    "the result is derived in the infinite key limit , thus ignoring statistical effects .",
    "though restricted in this sense , there are strong indications that these restriction can be lifted , so that our results , if successfully combined with other results will lead to the desired unconditional security .",
    "we expect this will be a fair representation of the ( still missing ) full unconditional security proof .",
    "we compare different techniques of extracting a secret key from shared classical data such as postselection ( ps ) and reverse reconciliation ( rr ) .",
    "moreover , our approach can be modified to include two - way communication in the classical post - processing step of the protocol and non - ideal error correction .",
    "any qkd protocol can be thought of consisting of two phases .",
    "the goal of the first phase is to distribute an effectively entangled state between alice and bob @xcite .",
    "this entanglement does not need to be present in actual physical systems .",
    "instead , it can be brought in as a theoretical construct @xcite , as explained in more detail in sec .",
    "iii . in practise",
    ", alice and bob will use a prepare - and - measure scheme , where alice encodes some bit - value @xmath0 into non - orthogonal signal states .",
    "she sends a sequence of @xmath1 such states over the quantum channel to bob . in general , eve might interact coherently with these @xmath1 states .",
    "we restrict ourselves here to the case of collective attacks , where eve attaches an independent probe to each signal .",
    "then the total state shared between alice and bob will be of tensor product form @xmath2 .",
    "eve , however , may keep her quantum states @xmath3 , which summarize all her knowledge about the sent signals until the second phase of the protocol is completed . in this phase ,",
    "alice and bob use an authenticated but otherwise insecure classical channel to correct for errors in their bit - strings and to cut out eve s knowledge about the key ( privacy amplification)@xcite .",
    "the information sent over the classical channel becomes available to eve who then can optimize her collective measurements on the quantum states .",
    "for this scenario of collective attacks , we apply the generic approach by devetak and winter @xcite to give a lower bound on the secret key rate .",
    "the security analysis presented here applies to the situation where the quantum channel connecting alice and bob is lossy with single - photon transmittivity @xmath4 and imposes gaussian excess noise @xmath5 on the quadrature distributions .",
    "this kind of noise is typically seen in the experiments @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that a distillation of a secret key in cv - qkd is only possible when @xmath6 because otherwise the correlations between alice and bob could have originated from a separable state @xcite . here , the excess noise @xmath5 is determined via homodyne measurements .",
    "it can easily be verified that our calculated lower bounds on the secret key rate for the various types of protocols are well in the regime of quantum correlations .    in this article",
    ", we compare different approaches to distill a key for a cv prepare - and - measure scheme .",
    "we assume that the quantum channel between alice and bob can be verified to be gaussian through tomographic complete measurements and that eve is restricted to collective attacks .",
    "while the observation of a gaussian channel is certainly a restriction , it should be noted that this scenario is typically encountered in practise .",
    "moreover , recent work @xcite indicates that the gaussian attack might be optimal for the non - postselected protocols considered here .",
    "however , it is still an open problem to relate this result to protocols including announcements and postselection .",
    "furthermore , there is hope to find a quantum de finetti like argument @xcite valid in the regime of continuous variables to extend the security against collective attacks to unconditional security , as this can already be done in finite dimensions .",
    "since we are only interested in the key rate in the asymptotic limit , we do not consider any finite size effects in our analysis .",
    "a complete security proof would have to resolve these issues .",
    "we consider a protocol where alice uses coherent states as signals and send through eve s domain to bob , who performs a heterodyne measurement onto the received states .",
    "it is known that one can improve the secret key rate if one introduces reverse reconciliation ( rr ) @xcite .",
    "this means that bob decides on a raw key based upon his measurement results and consequently sends alice correction information over the public channel in the error correction step of the protocol .",
    "another way to improve the performance of the protocol is to employ postselection ( ps)@xcite : bob only retains measurement outcomes that are closely correlated to alice in order to gain some advantage over eve .",
    "this approach can lead to positive secret key rates for direct reconciliation ( dr ) schemes beyond the so called 3db loss limit @xcite .",
    "since both approaches are not mutual exclusive , we consider combinations of dr and rr with ps .",
    "if one takes a realistic error correction protocol into account , it has been shown that it is necessary to introduce a postselection step in the rr protocols to retrieve the initial advantage that rr has over dr @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the qkd protocol under investigation .",
    "then we describe the state distribution scheme in an entanglement based scheme .",
    "the fact that state distribution in our protocol can be seen as alice and bob performing tomographic complete measurements lets us restrict eve s knowledge about the signals .",
    "this is applied to the gaussian noisy channel in the next section . in sec .",
    "v we modify our protocol and let alice and bob partially announce their measurement outcomes .",
    "this defines independent effective binary channels .",
    "next , we calculate a lower bound on the secret key rate for each binary channel independently .",
    "the last section contains the numerical optimized secret key rates and our conclusion .",
    "we consider a prepare - and - measure scheme where alice encodes her bit value into the modulation of coherent states @xmath7 as signals .",
    "the complex amplitude @xmath8 is chosen at random according to a symmetric gaussian probability distribution @xmath9 centered around the origin .",
    "alice s assigns her signal the bit value 0 ( 1 ) if the real part of the sent amplitude @xmath10 is positive ( negative ) .",
    "the states @xmath7 are then sent through eve s domain to bob .",
    "bob performs a heterodyne measurement on the received states @xmath11 , which is mathematically equivalent to a projection onto a coherent state @xmath12 .",
    "he obtains the measurement outcome @xmath13 with probability @xmath14 and assigns a bit value 0 ( 1 ) whenever his measurement outcome @xmath15 is positive ( negative ) .",
    "after bob has measured out the received states , alice announces partially the amplitude of the sent signals as @xmath16 and bob announces respectively partially his measurement outcome as @xmath17 . as we will see in sec .",
    "v , this announcement will enable us to decompose the problem into effective independent binary channels .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is that we rephrase the state preparation step in the prepare - and - measure setup in an entanglement based way .",
    "this can be done by supplying alice with a suitable source of entangled states .",
    "one part of the entangled state is kept by alice whereas the other part is sent through the quantum channel to bob .",
    "this scheme is a valid description of the prepare - and - measure scheme , if a measurement performed by alice onto her part of the entangled state effectively prepares the desired conditional state of the prepare - and - measure scheme with the proper _ a priori _ probabilities .",
    "as we show later , this can be done for the protocol introduced in the previous section . moreover",
    ", both measurements performed by alice and bob turn out to be tomographical complete in our case .    after preparing @xmath1 entangled states , alice and bob share the state @xmath2 , since we restrict eve to collective attacks . without loss of generality",
    "one can assume that @xmath18 originates from a pure three party state @xmath19 .",
    "eve holds the purifying environment @xmath20 of @xmath18 which summarizes her knowledge about the distributed states .",
    "as we restrict ourselves to the case when both measurements performed by alice and bob are tomographic complete , they can in principle reconstruct their shared state @xmath18 .",
    "however , we skip details of the tomography in our analysis as we are only interested in evaluating the secret key rate in the asymptotic limit as @xmath21 . therefore , the security analysis presented here can be considered as incomplete .",
    "the aim is to investigate what the rate one can expect to find assuming that one solves the additional steps involving the estimate of the state shared by alice and bob .    from the purity of state @xmath19 it follows from schmidt s decomposition that @xmath22 and @xmath23 have the same eigenvalues .",
    "eve s reduced density matrix @xmath20 is then determined up to an arbitrary unitary operation on her system by the state tomography .",
    "this in turn completely determines eve s knowledge about the distributed signals .    in the following",
    "we apply this kind of analysis to our protocol from sec .",
    "ii in a realistic scenario .",
    "it has been shown by grosshans _",
    "_ @xcite that alice s state preparation can formally be described in an entanglement based scheme .",
    "it corresponds to a situation where alice has a source under her control that produces two - mode squeezed states @xmath24 .",
    "if alice performs a heterodyne measurement onto her part of the state , she effectively prepares a coherent state in the @xmath25 system with gaussian _ a priori _ probability . as the source of two - mode squeezed states is under her control",
    ", she can choose a suitable squeezing parameter so that she indeed effectively prepares coherent states with the proper _ a priori _ probability ( [ apriori ] ) .",
    "the part @xmath25 of the state is then passed to bob through eve s domain .",
    "bob performs a heterodyne measurement on the received state .",
    "since this measurement is tomographical complete , we can directly apply the reasoning of the last section to this specific protocol and obtain the state in eve s hand .    for the state tomography step ,",
    "it is worth noting that alice s reduced density matrix @xmath26 is fixed by preparing coherent states @xmath7 with the _ a priori _ probabilities given by eq .",
    "( [ apriori ] ) .",
    "one can therefore parameterize alice s subsystem by the variance @xmath27 of the probability distribution @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , it suffices to check the conditional states @xmath11 to estimate eve s interference with the signals .",
    "however , we do not consider arbitrary noise imposed by eve on the conditional states , but limit our security analysis to a scenario which is typically encountered in experiments : we assume that the states bob receives are attenuated by the loss @xmath4 in the quantum channel and the conditional probability distributions @xmath29 as given by eq .",
    "( [ qfunct ] ) still have gaussian form but are broadened by a factor @xmath30 the so called excess noise . here",
    ", @xmath31 denotes the observed variance of the classical probability distribution ( [ qfunct ] ) and @xmath32 is the corresponding variance of the vacuum .",
    "we have included the factor @xmath33 so that our definition of the excess noise matches the one given in ref . @xcite via quadrature-  measurements .",
    "the quadrature operator @xmath34 is defined as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the photon annihilation and creation operator . as a further assumption",
    ", we suppose that the channel adds the same amount of noise in both quadratures , so that bob effectively verifies that he receives displaced thermal states as conditional states , denoted by @xmath11",
    ". then the probability of bob getting the measurement outcome @xmath13 conditioned on alice sending a coherent state with amplitude @xmath38 is given by eq .",
    "( [ qfunct ] ) as @xmath39 since bob s subsystem can be characterized by the estimated channel parameters , the total bipartite state @xmath18 is given by the input variance @xmath27 , the excess noise @xmath5 and the loss @xmath4 .",
    "as mentioned before , the knowledge @xmath18 determines eve s quantum state @xmath20 up to an arbitrary unitary operation on her system when complete tomographic measurements are available .",
    "it then follows that eve s knowledge about the signals is fixed by the set of parameters @xmath27 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , all attacks performed by eve give her exactly the same amount of information about the signals as long as the channel can be verified to be gaussian .",
    "in particular , this means that attacks like the entangling cloner @xcite or the amplifier attack @xcite are equivalent in this setting and eve retains the whole purifying environment .",
    "recent results concerning the optimality of gaussian attacks , when the full tomographic information is not available , can be found in @xcite .    here",
    "one can pick a specific attack to construct eve s ancilla system @xmath20 , which is only restricted in the sense that the conditional states @xmath11 that bob receives are thermal states and eve retains the whole purifying environment of @xmath11 . on the other hand ,",
    "the joint probability distribution @xmath40 of alice preparing an input state with amplitude @xmath38 and bob obtaining a measurement outcome @xmath13 is fixed by the state tomography .",
    "it follows that eve s conditional states @xmath41 already contain all her knowledge about the distributed signals .",
    "these states are pure , since they can be thought of originating from a projection measurement of the pure three party state @xmath19 .",
    "equivalently , eve s information can also summarized in the matrix of all possible overlaps @xmath42 .",
    "we will proceed to calculate a lower bound on the secret key rate with the specified discretisation to bit - values of continuous outcomes @xmath13 and @xmath38 .",
    "it turns out that in this case eve will effectively have to distinguish non - gaussian states on an infinite dimensional hilbert space to infer the bit - value .",
    "since this is hard to solve in general , we apply an approach to define effective binary channels as we have already done in @xcite and let alice and bob partially announce @xmath38 and @xmath13 .",
    "this partial knowledge will become available to eve , who then only needs to distinguish two nonorthogonal states on a two dimensional hilbert space , so that we can evaluate easily all related quantities .",
    "the security analysis presented here is limited to the collective attack scenario , so that the bipartite state between alice and bob after @xmath1 uses of the quantum channel is simply @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , bob s measurement outcomes @xmath13 on subsequent signals are independent .",
    "suppose now that alice announces the modulus of the real part @xmath43 and the imaginary part @xmath44 of the prepared amplitude @xmath8 .",
    "now bob knows that the state he receives can only originate from the two possible states @xmath45 and that in each distributed state one bit of classical information is encoded .",
    "each distribution of a signal between alice and bob corresponds to the use of an effective binary channel defined by alice s announcement and bob s measurement . from eq .",
    "( [ apriori ] ) follows that both possible input states occur with equal probability .",
    "the probability of alice making a certain announcement @xmath16 can be directly calculated form eq .",
    "( [ apriori ] ) as @xmath46 bob performs a heterodyne measurement on the received state .",

    "( [ probbetagivena ] ) follows that @xmath53 so that the probability for bob making an announcement @xmath54 given alice announced @xmath51 is @xmath55 both announcements of alice and bob for a given distributed state will then define one effective binary channel .",
    "furthermore , the error probability for bob assigning the wrong bit - value can be computed from ( [ condprob ] ) as @xmath56 where we have chosen to describe bob s measurement outcome @xmath13 by the announcement @xmath54 and the sign of the measured @xmath15 , which corresponds to bob s decision on a bit - value .",

    "this case is common in qkd and we refer to it as direct reconciliation ( dr ) .",
    "as already mentioned , there exists an inequivalent way to distill a key from exchanged quantum states in cv - qkd : with the use of strict one - way communication in the classical post - processing step of the protocol , one can force eve to infer bob s measurement outcome rather than the encoded bit - value .",
    "this method is called reverse reconciliation and was first pointed out by grosshans @xcite . for the specific protocol investigated here",
    "this means that eve has to discriminate @xmath82 and @xmath83 for a given effective binary channel in the rr schemes .",

    "all effective binary channels contribute a positive amount to the secret key rate , if one only takes losses in the quantum channel into account @xcite . in this scenario , postselecting the measurement outcomes can not improve the secret key rate .",

    "now the ps - rr scheme performs better than the dr counterpart for all values of the excess noise , though the behavior of the secret rate gets more and more similar for increasing excess noise .",
    "this shows again that it is advantageous to combine postselection with reverse reconciliation for best performance in the presence of gaussian noisy quantum channels .",
    "however , here we assume that all observed excess noise occurs in the quantum channel and can therefore be exploited by eve .",
    "as a benchmark , one can tolerate an excess noise of about @xmath176 if the quantum channel has 50% transmittivity .",
    "it follows that the applicability of the protocols is very limited with this conservative assumption .",
    "the security analysis presented here assumes that the communication between alice and bob in the classical post - processing step is strictly one - way . from a practical point of view",
    "however , it is favorable to give lower bounds to the secret key rate @xmath84 for two - way communication , since these kind of protocols can easily be implemented with known error correction procedures like cascade . in principle , the bound ( [ dev / win ] ) requires one - way communication to be used .",
    "this can be circumvented however , if one reveals all information to eve that is in principle obtainable by an eavesdropper when two - way classical post - processing is used . following earlier treatment in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can assume for two - way error correction the worst - case scenario in which the precise position of the errors in bob s data become publicly known .",
    "then it does not matter anymore , whether alice or whether bob make subsequent announcements .",
    "note that in cascade , bob s announcements are completely determined by the error position , and therefore no longer need to be taken into account when calculating the cost of error correction .",
    "given this knowledge , eve can update the state @xmath74 ( [ rhoe ] ) that summarizes her knowledge about the distributed signals and the remaining communication can be chosen to be one - way .",
    "( [ dev / win ] ) is again valid , but the states @xmath74 now include this additional information .",
    "it follows that eve either holds the state @xmath177 or @xmath178 in her ancilla system . obviously , the probability that an error in the bit assignment occurs is given by @xmath60 .",
    "it is then easy to show that eve s information about the signals for a given announcement @xmath179 is bounded by @xmath180 whereas the second line follows from the fact that here eve has to distinguish pure states .",

    "a practical implementation using two - way error correction codes like cascade will therefore yield a secret key rate close to the one - way dr - ps rate .",

    "it can be seen that one - way ps - rr has a significant advantage over the attainable two - way protocol only for very low values of the channel excess noise @xmath5 .",
    "this indicates that the development of efficient one - way codes , as currently under investigation by several groups , will significantly benefit rr protocols if the channel excess noise can be assumed to be of the order of a few percent .",
    "in conclusion , we have addressed security issues for a cv - qkd scheme in a practical setting .",
    "it is important to include a postselection procedure in both the rr and dr schemes to ensure that the protocols perform robust against gaussian excess noise .",
    "we have shown that a implementation using two - way error correction yields a secret key rate close to the rate of the one - way direct reconciled protocol . as the excess noise increases , the secret key rates for the one - way direct or reverse reconciled protocols become more and maore similar to the ones obtainable by two - way communication .",
