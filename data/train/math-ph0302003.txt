    "in many situations in radiation physics the value of the solid angle subtended by a circular cylindrical detector at a point source is needed . the case of an isotropic point source",
    "has been treated to great extent ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in a recent work",
    "@xcite we derived analytical expressions for the solid angle subtended by a cylinder at a point cosine source , under the restriction that the source and cylinder axes are orthogonal to each other . in the present work we obtain similar expressions in the case where the source direction is parallel to the cylinder axis .",
    "an expression ( eq . [ eq_omega_circ_hubbell ] ) for the solid angle subtended by a circular disc with symmetry axis parallel to the source direction is also given as an auxiliary result .",
    "it should be mentioned that this latter expression appeared previously ( * ? ? ?",
    "29 ) in a slightly different context .",
    "the authors detailed a quite general procedure to calculate the response of a small detector to an axially symmetric source with arbitrary polar angle distribution , uniformly spread on a circular disc . in that work , @xmath0 ( here eq .",
    "[ eq_omega_circ_hubbell ] ) is interpreted as the response of a plane detector parallel to a lambertian uniformly distributed disc source . in the same work",
    "the result is also credited to other authors ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    with the on - going computer revolution ,",
    "very complex problems otherwise impossible to tackle , are routinely addressed using numerical methods .",
    "calculations such as the one presented here , amounting to a one - dimensional integration , can be quickly specified and performed in a desk - top computer with minimal effort . nevertheless , we believe that in the few fortunate occasions where simple expressions exist in closed form , they deserve an interested look and are worth the effort of finding them",
    ". there are various reasons for this .",
    "no matter how careful the error - checking procedure followed , any numerical result should always be taken with some degree of prudence .",
    "in fact , except for the most simple situations , a great deal of effort is normally put into testing the result , rather than into obtaining it .",
    "analytical results can be of some help here by providing reliable tests to computational algorithms .",
    "also , a closed expression can sometimes be given an intuitive interpretation like the one provided for @xmath0 in section ( [ section_geointerp_omegacirc ] ) and , at the very least , enables the usage of analytical tools to search for extreme values , regions of monotony , reliable approximations , asymptotic expressions , etc .",
    "furthermore , the existence of a closed expression for a point source reduces the complexity of the problem when considering the more realistic case of a planar spread source .",
    "the required four - dimensional integral can of course be reduced to a double integral by using the exact expressions deduced here for a point source . in section ( [ section_spreadsource ] )",
    "we illustrate this by obtaining an analytical result for the solid angle defined by a cosine source evenly distributed on a circular disc and a disc detector , in the very special situation where the two discs share the same symmetry axis which is also assumed to be coincident with the source direction . reducing the dimensionality of a numerical integration",
    "is of obvious advantage because the calculation is less prone to numerical errors and can be performed faster .",
    "in fact , when using quadrature formulae like simpson s or gaussian rules to calculate multidimensional integrals , the total number of points ( @xmath1 ) scales like @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of quadrature points used in each dimension and @xmath4 is the dimensionality of the integral .",
    "the number of evaluations of the integrand can then become prohibitively high , regardless of the computing resources available , making necessary the resort to the monte carlo method , which , of course , has the drawback of a small above which the monte carlo method is faster than any quadrature rule .",
    "this is so because the convergence rate of the quadrature rule is that of the one - dimensional rule .",
    "for instance , simpson s rule error is proportional @xmath5 or to @xmath6 in @xmath4 dimensions , which means simpson s rule should , in general , be slower than monte carlo for @xmath7 . ]",
    "convergence rate ( only as @xmath8 ) .",
    "this was discussed in a review by @xcite , who set ( in 1980 ) the feasibility limit to the use of a ten - point gaussian rule to five dimensions ( with limited computer resources available ) and to ten dimensions ( with unlimited computer resources ) .    to illustrate the behavior of the solid angle sample plots",
    "are presented in section ( [ section_results ] ) .",
    "the solid angle ( @xmath9 ) subtended by a given surface at a point source can be defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the source distribution . in the case of a point cosine",
    "the distribution is defined with respect to some direction axis specified by the unit vector @xmath12 and it is given by @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath14 factor ensures that @xmath15 . setting @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the angle between the two axes",
    ", there results that @xmath18 so that the source only emits into the hemisphere around @xmath12 . in the following",
    "we shall consider the situation of a right circular cylinder with axis parallel to @xmath12 .",
    "the source is assumed to be at the origin of the coordinate system and the @xmath19 axis is chosen both aligned with @xmath12 and parallel to the cylinder axis .",
    "the solid angle is then given by@xmath20 where @xmath21 is the polar angle from the @xmath19 axis ; @xmath22 is the azimuthal angle in the xy plane and the limiting angles are to be determined from the conditions that @xmath23 and that each included @xmath24 direction hits the surface .",
    "the solid angle @xmath25 of the whole cylinder can in general be decomposed according to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath0 are the contributions of the cylindrical surface and of one of the end circles . to calculate these quantities we refer to figs .",
