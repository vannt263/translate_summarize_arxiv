    "the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) paradox @xcite established a link between entanglement and nonlocality @xcite in quantum mechanics . the extent to which entanglement can exist in spatially separated macroscopic and massive systems",
    "is still essentially unknown .",
    "entanglement in optics however has been extensively studied and numerous experiments have shown evidence for it @xcite .",
    "an important distinction is that optical entanglement involves ( nearly ) massless particles , and hence is a much less rigorous test of any gravitational effects present .",
    "generation of epr entanglement between two massive systems therefore represents an important challenge .",
    "such entanglement is a step in the direction of fundamental tests of quantum mechanics , and is relevant to the long term quest for understanding the relationship between quantum theory and gravity .",
    "ultimately , one would like to demonstrate spatially entangled mass distributions , and this appears much more promising for ultra - cold atoms than for room - temperature atoms .",
    "for this reason , we focus on ultra - cold bec environments here .",
    "this is also relevant if bec interferometry is to be useful to those areas of quantum information and metrology where entanglement is known to give an advantage @xcite . in this paper , we study strategies for generation of epr entanglement between bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) confined to two spatially separated potential wells .",
    "quantum correlations and epr tests for bose - einstein condensates have been suggested previously , with strategies involving molecular down - conversion @xcite and four wave mixing interactions @xcite , among others .",
    "early experiments measuring free - space correlations demonstrated promising signatures of increased fluctuations associated with entanglement @xcite , but were unable to conclusively demonstrate entanglement or squeezing via reduced fluctuations , largely due to measurement inefficiencies .",
    "this has improved with recent multi - channel plate detection methods , but detection efficiency still remains an issue @xcite.entanglement has also been measured , very recently , for distinct but nearly spatially superimposed modes @xcite in an optical lattice .    here , we are motivated to study the two well case , in view of experiments that have used this or similar systems to confirm both sub - shot noise quantum correlations @xcite , and multiparticle entanglement among a small group of atoms @xcite . for much larger numbers of atoms ( @xmath0 ) ,",
    "nearly quantum limited interferometry has been recently verified @xcite , showing that trapped atom interferometry has the potential to reach mesoscopic sizes .",
    "there have also been a number of previous theoretical studies @xcite that outline different proposals and entanglement signatures .",
    "the goal of this paper is to clarify what it means to have an epr entanglement between groups of atoms in a bec , and outline different strategies for achieving this goal .",
    "we define epr entanglement as being that entanglement existing , at least in principle , between two spatially separated systems , so that it could potentially realize an epr paradox . for epr entanglement to be claimed , three properties must be evident @xcite :    1 .",
    "two systems must be shown entangled through local measurements at spatially distinct locations .",
    "2 .   the nature of the entanglement criterion should be to confirm an epr paradox .",
    "this requires measurement of sufficiently strong correlation between the two systems , for two non - commuting `` epr '' observables like position and momentum @xcite .",
    "a more sophisticated approach would allow other entanglement measures , such as those for `` epr steering '' @xcite which reveal an inconsistency between local realism and the completeness of quantum mechanics for other types of measurement strategies .",
    "3 .   to justify epr s no `` spooky action - at - a - distance '' assumption @xcite , the measurement events should be causally separated .    for large groups of atoms ,",
    "the task of detecting epr entanglement is much more feasible when the emphasis is on the epr paradox itself , rather than on the failure of bell s local hidden variable model @xcite . for spatially separated systems ,",
    "the detection of sufficient correlation of locally defined epr observables so that entanglement is confirmed @xcite would represent an achievable first benchmark .",
    "this by itself is notvidence for the epr paradox , although it is a necessary condition .",
    "the second step of confirming the paradox has been carried out for photons @xcite , and also appears achievable for atoms .",
    "the last step is probably the most difficult for atoms .",
    "it would require either very fast measurements in one vacuum chamber , or hybrid techniques involving two separated becs with coupling via atom - photon interfaces @xcite , in order to achieve causally separated measurement .",
    "there are many possible strategies for generation of spatial epr entanglement .",
    "early experiments employed two photon cascades and , later , optical parametric down conversion , to generate entangled photon pairs @xcite .",
    "continuous variable epr entanglement between two fields , in a so - called `` two - mode squeezed state '' @xcite , was also generated using parametric down conversion @xcite .",
    "such entanglement gave evidence for an epr paradox @xcite , although true causal separation of measurement events was not demonstrated in these experiments .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section [ sec : entanglement - strategies ] we give a general introduction to the different possible entanglement strategies .",
    "section [ sec : measurement - strategies ] focuses on signatures for demonstrating entanglement , as well as the hierarchy of nonlocality measures including epr - steering and bell indicators .",
    "section [ sec : generation - of - number - conserving ] considers entanglement preparation in a two - well system , modeled as two modes with boson operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in this case , the s - wave scattering _ intra - well _ interactions , given by hamiltonians @xmath3 and @xmath4 , provide the local nonlinearity at each well , while the coupling or tunneling _",
    "inter - well _ term , modeled as @xmath5 generates inter - well entanglement . here",
    "the intra- and inter - well interactions act _ simultaneously _ , in the adiabatic formation of the ground state .",
    "section [ sec : epr - entanglement :- four ] treats a four - mode generalization of this .",
    "this has the advantage that epr - entanglement can be measured using atom counting at each site , without the use of a local oscillator .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section [ sec : summary ] , with technical details given in the appendices .",
    "this paper is based on the preliminary ideas presented in a letter @xcite .",
    "a second class of entanglement strategies using dynamical techniques will be analyzed in a subsequentpaper .",
    "suppose two spatially separated systems are describable as distinct modes , represented by boson operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "there are two prototype states that one can consider , that can give multiparticle epr entanglement .",
    "the first , which we ca currently the most widely known and used @xcite .",
    "we consider an entangled state with number correlations : @xmath6 this type of two - mode squeezed state gives two - particle correlations arising from a pair production process @xmath7 where @xmath8 but @xmath9 , and the number difference is always squeezed @xcite .",
    "these epr states are formed in optics with parametric down conversion @xcite , and similarly in nondegenerate four wave mixing @xcite .",
    "since they are * not * number - conserving , they are not typical of states formed in coupled two - well experiments , although they have been generated in recent bec experiments using spin or mode - changing collisions @xcite .",
    "we note that a full analysis of such a system requires consideration of the dynamics of the coupling to the pump that supplies the pairs of atoms . generally , there is a back - reaction on the pump mode , causing excess phase - noise that limits amount of squeezing or entanglement that can be generated @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus on a second form which we call number conserving .",
    "this occurs , for example , when fixed number states are input into a beam splitter : @xmath5 , so that @xmath10 but @xmath11 .",
    "we consider an entangled number - conserving state of form @xcite : @xmath12 this is similar to the states generated in optical fiber pulsed squeezing @xcite , and is the closest to the state prepared in some recent two - well bec experiments , where the total number is conserved @xcite",
    ". we will examine situations with number anti - correlated states prepared through evaporative cooling and adiabatic manipulations near the ground state of a coupled - well system , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system - two modes ] .      before examining detailed solutions for an interacting bec ,",
    "it is useful to summarize how two - mode number - conserving entanglement can be generated , in schematic form .",
    "we consider how to generate entanglement between two groups of atoms in separated potential wells in a bec . what is useful is a combination of * _ nonlinear local _ * interactions to generate a nonclassical squeezed state in each well - together with a * _ nonlocal linear _",
    "* interaction to produce the entanglement between two spatially distinct locations . in the case of the bec",
    ", the s - wave scattering can provide a nonlinear local interaction , and quantum diffusion across a potential barrier acts like a beam - splitter to provide the final nonlocal linear interaction .",
    "both effects occur at the same time in the schemes treated here , in sections [ sec : generation - of - number - conserving ] and [ sec : epr - entanglement :- four ] .",
    "we will show in section [ sec : generation - of - number - conserving ] that the entanglement generated for the two - well ground state with a fixed number of atoms can translate to an epr steering type of entanglement @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : system - two modes ] ) .",
    "for an _ actual _ demonstration of this sort of epr entanglement , however , one must use signatures that involve local measurements , for two spatially separated observers ( often called alice and bob ) , at sites @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "one can use local oscillator ( lo ) measurements at each site , that provide phase shifts or their equivalent between the measured and lo modes @xcite .",
    "@xmath15 are operators for two modes at @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath15 are prepared with a two mode number difference squeezing and an entanglement , by adiabatic cooling to the ground state . in section",
    "v , we develop signatures to detect the inter - well entanglement , using inter - well spin operators . [",
    "fig : system - two modes ] ]    * * two - mode entanglement preparation then analysis * : suppose the initial state is entangled through state preparation in a double - well potential .",
    "here the nonlinearity occurs during state preparation , and the other steps are to enable the entanglement to be transformed into an easily measurable form .",
    "experimentally , this appears relatively simple , although obtaining measurable signatures can be a challenge if strictly local measurements are used , as in an epr paradox demonstration .",

    ", @xmath20 ( and @xmath19 , @xmath21 ) can become entangled , due to the inter - well couplings .",
    "we allow for the asymmetric case where pair @xmath19 and @xmath21 have much greater numbers than @xmath18 and @xmath20 ( @xmath22 ) and also consider a case where modes @xmath19 and @xmath21 need not be entangled ( @xmath23    in both two and four mode cases , the basic idea is :    1 .   correlated ground state preparation , through evaporative cooling in a potential well _ with linear coupling between wells .",

    "measurement , usually from absorption imaging , giving occupation numbers .",
    "in the epr proposal @xcite , the paradox arose from correlations between the positions and momenta of two particles emitted from the same source . with optical or atomic bose fields",
    ", one can define the quadrature phase amplitudes of the modes , as @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and similarly for mode @xmath2 .",
    "these have the same commutators as position and momentum in a particle system .",
    "these quadratures , which are measured using local oscillators , can be used to detect the entanglement of the pair - correlated states discussed above , as performed recently for atoms by gross et al @xcite .",
    "the original epr paradox focused on states that showed correlation and anti - correlation for position and momentum respectively .",
    "duan et al and simon @xcite showed that entanglement between modes @xmath1 and @xmath2 is confirmed if @xmath26 in the case ( [ eq : duan-1 ] ) , the @xmath27 arises from the commutation relation @xmath28=1 $ ] , and reflects the quantum noise associated with the four observables .",
    "a full analysis of a local oscillator measurement shows that it is actually equivalent to a spin measurement , and closely related entanglement measures have been developed for use with spin measurements .",
    "in particular , one can show entanglement using the spin version of ( [ eq : duan-1 ] ) @xcite , @xmath29 and also the ( more sensitive ) heisenberg - product entanglement criterion @xcite @xmath30      epr s argument assumes that one observer ( alice ) can make precise predictions for the outcome of position or momentum measurements made by a second , distant observer ( bob ) . to quantitatively demonstrate the epr paradox ,",
    "the level of correlation in alice s predictions is compared with the quantum limit for a local state that might predetermine _",
    "bob s _ statistics .",
    "thus , for the epr paradox , the relevant quantum noise level is that of _ one _ observer , @xmath14 , alone , which implies a stricter condition formulated in terms of conditional variances @xcite .",
    "epr paradox entanglement is observed when @xmath31 since the precise choice of measurement at mode @xmath13 is not important , only the inference , this criterion is sometimes more generally written as @xmath32 . in the case of ( [ eq : duan-1 ] ) , the stricter condition @xmath33 if satisfied would imply an epr paradox entanglement @xcite .",
    "while the signatures ( [ eq : duan-1]-[eq : eprhalfduan ] ) have been used extensively in relation to epr - type entanglement , we do not use them in this paper .",
    "evaluating , we find in fact @xmath34 ( where here we use the conventional notation that @xmath35 ) .",
    "the signatures given above are not the only possible ones , and in fact there are many signatures both for entanglement and the epr paradox .",
    "a particularly useful alternative form was proposed by hillery and zubairy @xcite , and cavalcanti et al @xcite , as described and generalized below .",
    "modes @xmath1 and @xmath2 are entangled if @xcite @xmath36 this criterion is useful for states with a large phase moment @xmath37 , as will be studied in section v. in ref @xcite it was suggested how to rewrite this criterion for @xmath38 . for any nonhermitian operator @xmath39 , we consider the generalized variance , which must be nonnegative :    the _ first order _ ( @xmath40 ) hz criterion for entanglement becomesthe _ second order",

    "the terminology `` epr - steering '' is used to describe a more general epr paradox situation that can involve any type of measurement , not just conjugate spins or position / momentum @xcite .",
    "the epr paradox was discussed by schrodinger @xcite , who pointed to the phenomenon of `` steering '' .",
    "criteria for `` steering '' can be developed using the asymmetric local hidden state separable model developed in ref .",
