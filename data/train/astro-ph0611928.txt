    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) provide a vital probe to the early history of chemical enrichment in the universe ( shields 1976 ; hamann & ferland 1992 ; , ferland et  al .  1996 ; dietrich et  al .",
    "their brightness allow us to see chemically processed environments when the universe was less than 7% of it s current age ( fan et  al .",
    "2004 ) , thus giving us insights into early star formation and galaxy evolution .",
    "the spectra of the highest redshift agn are very similar to those of agn in the local universe ( fan et  al .",
    "2004 ) , suggesting that chemical enrichment of their environments operates on short cosmological time - scales .",
    "this feature makes local agn a good probe of chemical processing in the early universe .",
    "there are two main tracks for determining abundances in agn : broad emission lines ( bels ) are seen in most agn and are known to be formed in close proximity of the nucleus ( 0.010.1 pc . ; kaspi et  al .  2005 , and references therein ) .",
    "considerable effort was put into trying to determine abundances in agn by studying the relative strength of bels in individual as well as composite spectra ( e.g. , shields 1976 ; baldwin & netzer 1978 ; hamann & ferland 1992 ; ferland et  al .  1996 ; dietrich et  al .  1999 , 2003 )",
    "these studies suggest that the metalicity of the bel region ( belr ) is super solar .",
    "however , bel abundances studies are only relative in the sense that they do not measure the ratio of heavy elements to hydrogen directly . ratios of nitrogen to carbon and oxygen bels are measured and then converted to metalicity ( z ) using the expected secondary neucleosynthesis of nitrogen , which predicts n / o and n / c  @xmath4 or n / h  @xmath5 ( hamann & ferland 1999 ) .",
    "this assumption weakens the robustness of the bel metalicity claims in principle .",
    "in the best case where measurements of galactic environment are available in a high redshift galaxy , this assumption is not verified ( pettini et  al .",
    "furthermore , there are considerable systematic issues that affect these studies .",
    "the belr is spatially stratified and likely to have a wide range of densities and temperatures ( nagao et  al.2006 ) .",
    "therefore , different bels can arise from largely different regions , which complicates the use of bel line flux ratios as abundance indicators .",
    "radiation transfer inside the opaque bel material is a difficult problem that further complicates interpreting observed bel ratios ( netzer 1990 ) .    the second track for determining abundances is using absorption lines associated with agn outflows . in principal ,",
    "absorption line studies allow for absolute abundances measurements since the hydrogen lyman series troughs can yield direct ratios of hydrogen to heavy elements .",
    "agn outflows are evident by resonance line absorption troughs , which are blueshifted with respect to the systemic redshift of their emission counterparts . in seyfert galaxies velocities of several hundred  ( crenshaw et  al .",
    "1999 ; kriss et  al .",
    "2000 ) are typically observed in both uv resonance lines ( e.g. ,  @xmath61548.20,1550.77 ,  @xmath61238.82,1242.80 ,  @xmath61031.93,1037.62 and ly@xmath7 ) , as well as in x - ray resonance lines ( kaastra et  al .",
    "2000 , 2002 ; kaspi et  al .  2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "similar outflows ( often with significantly higher velocities ) are seen in quasars which are the luminous relatives of seyfert galaxies ( weymann et  al .",
    "1991 ; korista , voit , morris , & weymann 1993 ; arav et  al .",
    "distances of the outflows from the central source can range from smaller than belr distances ( qso 1603 ; arav et al 2001 ) ; tens of pc .",
    "( ngc 3783 ; gabel et  al .",
    "2005b ) ; 1000 pc .",
    "( qso 1044 ; de kool et  al .",
    "thus , in most cases the outflows are associated with material in the vicinity of the agn , and can be used as diagnostics for the chemically enriched environment at the center of galaxies .",
    "a main obstacle in determining abundances using outflow absorption lines is obtaining reliable measurements of the absorption column densities from the troughs . in the last few years our group ( arav 1997 ; arav et  al .",
    "1999a ; arav et  al .",
    "1999b ; de  kool et  al .",
    "2001 ; arav et  al .  2002 , 2003 ) and others ( barlow 1997 , telfer et  al .",
    "1998 , churchill et  al .  1999 , ganguly et  al .",
    "1999 ) have shown that in quasar outflows most lines are saturated even when not black . as a consequence the apparent optical depth method , which stipulates that the optical depth @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the residual intensity in the trough , is not a good approximation for outflow troughs .",
    "in addition , using the doublet method ( barlow 1997 , hamann et al.1997 ) we have shown that in many cases the shapes of the troughs are almost entirely due to changes in the line of sight covering as a function of velocity , rather than to differences in optical depth ( arav et  al .  1999b ; de  kool et  al .",
    "2001 ; arav et  al .  2001a",
    "; gabel et  al .",
    "gabel et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) show the same effect in the outflow troughs of ngc  3783 , as does scott et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) for mrk  279 . as a consequence ,",
    "the column densities inferred from the depths of the troughs are only lower limits .    in order to measure reliable column densities",
    "we found it necessary to use a two step combination : first , we developed analysis methods that can disentangle the covering factors from the optical depth ( gabel et al .",
    "2003 , 2005a ) .",
    "second , these methods depend on having high - resolution ( @xmath10 20,000 ) and high signal - to - noise ( s / n @xmath10 20 ) spectral data of outflow troughs . furthermore , we critically rely on fully - resolved uncontaminated doublet and multiple troughs .",
    "mrk  279 is the optimal target for such analysis , since it allows us to obtain data with the above specification on the , , and  doublets , as well as on several lyman series troughs .",
    "the latter are crucial for any abundances determination ( see   5.1 ) . before applying this analysis to the mrk  279 data",
    ", we tested the validity of our absorption model .",
    "the main alternatives are inhomogeneous absorber models ( de kool , korista & arav 2002 ) .",
    "we tested the main variants of inhomogeneous absorber models on the mrk  279 data set and concluded that the outflow can not be fitted well with these models ( arav et  al .",
    "2005 ; see   5.2.1 ) . following these tests we used the partial covering absorber model to extract the column densities of all the observed ions in the mrk  279 outflow ( gabel et  al .",
    "2005a ) .",
    "in this paper we present the determination of chemical abundances in the agn outflow emanating from mrk  279 , using the high - quality simultaneous uv data sets from hst / stis and fuse .",
    "our procedure for determining the abundances goes as follows : we treat each spectral resolution element as an independent measurement ( see   5.1 for discussion ) . after determining the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) appropriate for mrk  279 (   2.2 ) , we solve for the ionization parameter ( @xmath11 ) and the total hydrogen column density ( @xmath12 ) , independently for each of our 15 resolution elements (   2.3 ) .",
    "this is done by comparing the measured column densities with photoionization grid models , assuming a given set of cno abundances .",
    "each resolution element is allowed to have a different combination of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "however , we require the same set of cno abundances for all resolution elements . the cno composition of the outflow is determined to be",
    "the abundance set that yields the best fit for all 15 resolution elements (   3 ) .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a comparison of the photoionization and abundances results presented here with the independent analysis of the simultaneous mrk  279 x - ray spectra . in   5",
    "we discuss our results .",
    "the appendix gives the details for the extraction of ionic column densities from the observed troughs , with emphasis on the associated errors .",
    "on may 2003 we obtained simultaneous x - ray and uv observations of the mrk  279 agn outflow .",
    "( description of the uv observations is found in gabel et  al .  2005a , and the x - ray observations in costantini et  al.2006 . )",
    "the 92 ks fuse data have a spectral resolution of 20,000 and cover the observed wavelength 9051187 .",
    "these data yielded the highest quality  trough - spectrum of any agn outflow to date .",
    "the 16 orbits hst / stis / e140 m observation have a spectral resolution of 40,000 and cover the observed wavelength 11501730 .",
    "these data yielded high quality  and  troughs .",
    "the combined hst / fuse spectrum gives high signal - to - noise ,  and  troughs .",
    "compared with other well - studied agn outflow targets , the galactic column density in the direction of mrk  279 is quite low 1.6 compared with 4.4 and 8.7 for mrk  509 and ngc  3783 , respectively ( in units of @xmath13 @xmath2 ; hwang & bowyer 1997 ; kaspi et al 2002 ) . therefore , the outflow troughs of mrk  279 are significantly less contaminated with galactic absorption features than the other noted targets .    in gabel",
    "et  al .  (",
    "2005a ) we used a global fitting technique to extract three velocity - dependent quantities from the data : continuum covering factor , belr covering factor and column densities @xmath14 for all the detected ions .",
    "an important finding was that the outflow fully covers the continuum both for the lyman series troughs and for the cno doublets . in this paper",
    "we refine the @xmath14 measurements by using this finding .",
    "once the continuum coverage is known to be 100% , the doublet equations are reduced to two unknowns ( belr covering factor and optical depth ) , which we can solve for independently for each ion , since we have two residual intensity equations .",
    "these solutions are more physical and their errors are easier to estimate . in the appendix",
    "we give the details of the new solution while for the rest of the paper we use this improved set of @xmath14 determinations .",
    "the difference between the gabel et al ( 2005a ) and the current @xmath14 measurements can be seen in the first figure of the appendix ( fig.[fig : n_ion_errors ] ) .",
    "we point out that the main difference is in the size of the error bars , where we put much effort into obtaining physically accurate errors since the analysis is crucially dependent on these .",
    "we use simple slab photoionization models ( using the code cloudy ; ferland 1998 ) .",
    "such models are commonly used in the study of quasar outflows ( e.g. , weymann , turnshek , & christiansen 1985 ; arav , li & begelman 1994 ; hamann 1996 ; crenshaw & kraemer 1999 ; arav et  al .",
    "2001b ; gabel et  al .",
    "2006 ) and assume that the absorber consists of a constant density slab irradiated by an ionizing continuum .",
    "the two main parameters in these models are the thickness of the slab as measured by the total hydrogen column density ( @xmath12 ) and the ionization parameter @xmath11 ( defined as the ratio of number densities between hydrogen ionizing photons and hydrogen in all forms ) .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the incident flux is also important in determining the ionization equilibrium .",
    "the ionizing sed of mrk  279 is arguably the most tightly constrained of any agn to date .",
    "fuse observations set the flux at @xmath15  in the object s rest frame and the letgs on board chandra _ simultaneously _ provided reliable x - ray coverage for energies greater than 200 ev .",
    "even so , some ambiguity remains due to the gap between 13.8 ev and 200 ev ( see fig [ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "we opted to continue the slope of the fuse continuum and gradually steepen it until it matches the soft x - ray continuum .",
    "we chose this shape rather than connecting these two points with a simple power - law , since we consider it unlikely that a spectral break falls immediately at the edge of the observed uv data .",
    "we note that the 13.8 - 200 ev continuum would be somewhat softer with a simple power - law connecting the uv and x - ray data , and elaborate on the ramifications of such an sed in the discussion .",
    "to generate the mrk  279 sed shown in fig [ fig : sed ] , we used the cloudy ` agn ' command that generates the sum of two continua , @xmath16 .",
    "the first of these represents the optical / uv bump , and this command also imposes a low energy exponential cutoff at 1 micron .",
    "we chose @xmath17 and @xmath18 ev to smoothly and conservatively span the 900   @xmath19 200  ev spectral region .",
    "the second of the continua represents a high energy ( x - ray ) power law that lies between 1 ryd and 100 kev with cutoffs at both ends .",
    "we chose a slope to match the observed one , @xmath20 , and normalized this component s strength relative to the uv bump with an @xmath21 . the cloudy input command string that generated",
    "this continuum is ` agn 6.2 -1.35 -1.0 -1.1 ' , where the first parameter is @xmath22 , followed by @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "we base our photoionization analysis , and ultimately the abundance determinations on the grid - of - models approach created by arav et  al.(2001b ) .",
    "for a given @xmath14 we ran a grid of models spanning three orders of magnitude in both @xmath12 and @xmath11 .",
    "for these models we use the mrk  279 sed described above and assume solar abundances , as given by the cloudy code , where the carbon and oxygen abundances are taken from allende prieto et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2001 ) , and the nitrogen abundance is taken from holweger ( 2001 ) .",
    "the solar abundance of these elements compared to hydrogen are : c=@xmath26 , n=@xmath27 , o=@xmath28 .",
    "we then determine which combinations of @xmath12 and @xmath11 reproduce the observed @xmath14 and then plot the ion - curve , which is the locus of these points on the @xmath12/@xmath11 plane .",
    "we do that for each measured @xmath14 . ideally , a single value of @xmath12 and @xmath11 should be able to reproduce all the @xmath14 constraints .",
    "this is based on the assumption that the measured @xmath14 arise from a parcel of gas with uniform density that is irradiated by the given sed . on the @xmath12/@xmath11 plane",
    "this single value solution will be represented by the crossing of all the ion - curves at a single point .    a new feature that adds considerable diagnostic power to these models , is their velocity dependence .",
    "since the @xmath14 measurements are for a specific velocity , we obtain a grid model for each element of resolution along the trough .",
    "there is no a - priori reason why material flowing in different velocities should have the same ionization structure or have the same column density per unit velocity ( see   5.1 ) . separating the absorption trough into individual resolution elements",
    "therefore allows for a more accurate solution of the ionization structure of the flow , and as we show below , is the key for precise abundances determination .",
    "figure [ fig : nh_u_285_c_nion ] shows the grid model for the resolution - element centered around the @xmath29  outflow velocity .",
    "all the measured ions are represented .",
    "the upper limits from , ,  and , do not add meaningful constraints and are consistent with the results of our analysis . an important advantage over the analysis of the pg  0946 + 301 spectra ( arav et  al .",
    "2001 ) , is that all the @xmath14 shown on figure [ fig : nh_u_285_c_nion ] are actual measurements and not lower limits , as was the case for most ions in pg  0946 + 301 .      in measuring the @xmath14 for the outflow troughs in mrk  279 we accounted for most of the systematic issues that plagued previous measurements .",
    "unblended doublet and multiplet troughs were used , without which reliable outflow @xmath14 can not be measured in principle . both the continuum and belr covering factors were taken into consideration , and @xmath14 as a function of velocity was extracted .",
    "we therefore possess the first comprehensive set of reliable @xmath14 measurements for an agn outflow .",
    "extracting meaningful constraints on the ionization equilibrium and abundances from the measured @xmath14 requires having a reliable data base of the associated errors . estimating physical errors for the @xmath14 measurements is a complicated process that is fully described in the appendix .",
    "here we give a brief description of this process and a qualitative explanation for the different error values of the individual ions .",
    "for all ions except  the fitting procedure simultaneously finds the optimal covering factor and optical depth at a given velocity point .",
    "once the optimal combination is found , we derive the formal error of the parameters ( see appendix for full discussion ) .",
    "our approach is verified by the close match between the resultant flux deviations and the empirical flux errors in both positive and negative directions ( see the second figure in the appendix , fig  7 ) .",
    "the errors are not symmetrical .",
    "typically , the @xmath31 error is larger than the @xmath19 error and often much larger .",
    "this is due to the exponential dependence of the absorption on the optical depth .",
    "for example if @xmath32 we already absorb 98% of the flux covered by the outflow . increasing @xmath33 by 2",
    "only absorbs an additional 2% . a similar increase in flux requires a decrease of only 0.6 in @xmath33 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : nh_u_285_e_errors ] we show the errors associated with the photoionization model presented in figure [ fig : nh_u_285_c_nion ] .  has the largest errors because at that velocity its troughs are nearly saturated , and for that reason the asymmetry in its errors is also most pronounced",
    ".  exhibits the smallest errors , and therefore supplies the strongest constraint on the physical solutions for the outflowing gas .",
    "the  errors are the smallest because the observations cover five lyman series lines and the intrinsic optical depth ratio of the first three spans a factor of 18 .",
    "this , coupled with the fact that the trough is not close to saturation , yield tight constraints on the column density .",
    "in contrast the intrinsic optical depth ratio between the members of each cno doublet is 2 , yielding significantly less stringent constraints on their @xmath14 .",
    "is a singlet and therefore we had to make an assumption regarding its covering fraction .",
    "once we assumed the  coverage to be the same as   we derived tight constraints on its @xmath14 since the trough was far from saturation .",
    "finally , a contributing factor for the larger errors of the cno doublets is that flux errors are associated with both doublet components while often the difference between the two residual intensities is small compared to the flux values themselves .",
    "we are now in position to ask the first important physical question : do the ion curves in figure [ fig : nh_u_285_e_errors ] allow for an acceptable solution for the ionization equilibrium for this particular velocity slice of the outflow ?",
    "that is , is there a combination of @xmath12 and @xmath11 that will satisfy all the ion - curve constraints ?",
    "it is evident from figure [ fig : nh_u_285_e_errors ] that this is not the case , as the error stripes for  and  do not overlap on this grid - model plot .",
    "a physical solution can not be obtained for this velocity - slice of the outflow assuming solar abundances . in figure",
    "[ fig : nh_u_285_f_chi2 ] we show the formal @xmath30 solution for the best fit values of @xmath12 and @xmath11 of this velocity slice .",
    "the reduced @xmath34 formally shows that the model does not yield a statistically valid fit for the data .",
    "of the 15 slices , 13 yield reduced @xmath30 between 2 - 10 , and only two have reduced @xmath30 smaller than 2 .",
    "the most plausible way to obtain a physical solution for @xmath12 and @xmath11 in figure [ fig : nh_u_285_e_errors ] is to drop the assumption of solar abundances . on our parameter space plots",
    "an increase in abundance is equivalent to lowering the entire related ion - curve , since less @xmath12 is needed for the same amount of the said element .",
    "we can see from figure [ fig : nh_u_285_e_errors ] that if the nitrogen abundance is 3 times higher than solar , the ion - curve will be lower by the same amount and the error stripes for  and  will comfortably overlap in parts of the parameter space .    for one velocity slice we can always achieve a perfect solution ( exact crossing of the ion curves ) by allowing the cno abundances relative to hydrogen to be free parameters .",
    "such a solution might be suggestive , but it is considered weak since we use three free parameters to make the 5 ion - curves cross at the same point .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : nh_u_285_c_nion ] , this is always the case .",
    "as long as we specify the value of @xmath11 to be that of the  and  ion - curves crossing point , the three free abundances parameters allow us to bring all cno ion - curves to meet at that @xmath11 value on top of the  curve .",
    "the way to obtain a robust rather than suggestive abundance determinations for the outflow is to use the velocity information .",
    "so far we have only dealt with a single velocity - slice .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that each velocity - slice will have an independent ionization solution , i.e. , its own @xmath35 values .",
    "the number density and column density of the outflow at each resolution element are determined by the flow s dynamics , which can be quite complicated ( proga 2005 ) .",
    "however , it is likely that an outflow component would have the same abundances at all velocities . therefore , the assumptions we make are : 1 ) each velocity - slice has an independent @xmath35 ionization solution ; 2 ) all velocity slices of the same outflow component have the same chemical abundances .      in mrk  279",
    "the outflow spans the velocity range @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "as described in gabel et  al .",
    "( 2005a ) the velocity range @xmath38 to @xmath37  is contaminated by unrelated absorption ( probably from the companion galaxy of mrk 279 , see scott et  al .",
    "2004 ) , which is detected in lines from low - ionization species ( , , ) , and especially in the  lyman series .",
    "for this reason we can not use the  trough measurements in the range @xmath38 to @xmath37 in our ionization and abundance analysis of the flow .",
    "we therefore concentrate on the @xmath36 to @xmath38  range where we have high quality uncontaminated measurements for , , ,  and .",
    "the hst stis 140 m grating yields 15 independent resolution elements for this range .",
    "we use the  trough spectrum to fix the velocity points of these elements and interpolate all the other trough s spectra to that velocity scale .",
    "fuse s resolution @xmath39 is only half that of the stis e140 m grating , and we interpolated them on the same velocity scale .",
    "we used the stis rather than the fuse resolution for the following reasons : a ) maintaining all the physical information of the stis troughs .",
    "b ) the  doublet covered by fuse was the most saturated and yielded the least constraining measurements , therefore an oversampling by a factor of two will not affect the physical conclusion significantly .",
    "c ) the  measurements arise from one stis line ( ) and two fuse lines (  and ) and the derived @xmath40 is smooth as a function of velocity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : n_ion_errors ] ) .",
    "thus , we preserve the stis velocity resolution for , while the smoothness of the measurements minimizes the effects of oversampling the fuse data on the physical conclusions , since no structure is seen on small velocity scales .      using the assumptions detailed in   3.1 , we simultaneously fit all the velocity slices , using similar methods to those used by gabel et  al .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath12 associated with each of the 15 velocity bins are the constrained free parameters .",
    "all velocity bins have the same given set of cno abundances relative to h. the abundances are introduced into the fit via a linear scale factor of the metal ionic column densities predicted by the solar metalicity grid of models .",
    "this is possible since all the absorbers considered here are optically thin to the euv ionizing radiation ( i.e. , the  and  ionization edges are optically thin ) , thus the total ionic column densities scale linearly with the abundances of their parent element . after minimizing the @xmath30 in each velocity bin , we sum all the minimum values from all the velocity bins .",
    "we repeat this process for 11 abundances values for each element ( spaced equally in log - space ) , for a total of @xmath41 models .    in each velocity bin , there are five measured @xmath14 ; the summation of these over the 15 velocity bins gives a total of 75 model constraints .",
    "the number of free parameters includes two per each velocity bin ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) times 15 velocity bins plus the three cno abundances , all together 33 free parameters .",
    "the best - fit solution is then the set of velocity - dependent @xmath11 , @xmath12 values and the c , n , and o abundances that minimize @xmath30 from : @xmath42 ^ 2 , \\label{eq : chi2_vel_sum}\\ ] ] where the measured column density of the @xmath43 ion in the @xmath44 velocity bin @xmath45 is compared with the model column densities from the grid @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the scale factor relative to solar abundances , and @xmath48 the measurement uncertainty .",
    "our initial models sampled a cube of cno abundance values spanning 0.1 - 10 times their solar values at a resolution of @xmath4960% between grid points . upon finding the general location of the best set of cno abundances we iteratively refined the span of abundances to a final resolution of 3% between grid points .",
    "it is important to verify that we found the absolute rather than a local @xmath30 minimun and to check whether there are other local minima that may give a different , but valid abundances solution . for these purposes we ran additional grid - models . in particular , we ran .",
    "the initial cube model with triple resolution and studied the behavior @xmath30 in that volume .",
    "we found no other minima in that phase - space volume .",
    "the best fit for all 15 velocity slices is obtained using the following set of cno abundances ( relative to solar ) carbon=2.2 , nitrogen=3.5 and oxygen=1.6 . for this model ,",
    "equation [ eq : chi2_vel_sum ] yields @xmath50 for 41 degrees of freedom or a reduced @xmath30 of @xmath51 . in figure",
    "[ fig : nh_u_285_abun2 ] we show the formal @xmath30 solution for the best fit values of @xmath12 and @xmath11 of the single velocity slice shown in figure [ fig : nh_u_285_f_chi2 ] .",
    "the reduced @xmath52 , formally shows that the model yields a statistically valid fit for the data .",
    "a similar situation occurs in most other velocity slices that include the same abundances solution .",
    "the range of reduced @xmath30 in all velocity slices is 0.52.1 , for three degrees of freedom .",
    "we calculate the model - independent errors associated with these abundance determinations by finding the 90% single - parameter confidence intervals obtained from changing only the said abundance while keeping the others fixed ( following press et  al .",
    "1989 and taylor 1997 ) .",
    "the results are shown in table 1 .",
    "thus , carbon and oxygen are enhanced by a factor of @xmath53 2 relative to solar values , while nitrogen is enhanced by a factor of 3 - 4 , in agreement with the @xmath54 scaling indicative of enhanced secondary production in massive stars ( hamman et  al .",
    "1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "one can also find a model - dependent error - estimate for an assumed @xmath54 scaling , since in that model the ratio of c / h and o / h are proportional to each other while n / h@xmath55(o / h)@xmath56 .",
    "for this model the 90% confidence level for nitrogen is only slightly lowered but the error bars on the oxygen and carbon abundances shrink by 60% and 50% respectively .",

    "costantini et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) explored two physical scenarios for the x - ray ionized absorber .",
    "the first set of models postulated discrete ionization components , and it was found that a model with two ionization zones gives a good fit to the x - ray absorption data .",
    "the second set of models postulated a continuous distribution of ionization parameter for the absorbing material .",
    "such models were successful in fitting the x - ray absorption data of ngc  5548 ( steenbrugge et  al.2005 ) .",
    "unlike the case for ngc  5548 , models with a simple power - law distribution in ionization parameter did not yield a satisfactory fit to the mrk  279 chandra / letgs data .",
    "a bimodal distribution was needed for an acceptable fit .",
    "such a model is close in concept to a two ionization zones model .",
    "since the simple two ionization zones model already gives a good fit to the data , we conclude that it provides a more plausible physical description for the mrk  279 x - ray absorber .",
    "we therefore compare our uv results to the results of the two ionization zones x - ray model .",
    "for the two ionization components model , costantini et  al .",

    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between the ionization parameter @xmath63 and the ionization parameter @xmath11 , which we are using in this paper . for our mrk  279",

    "therefore , for component 1 we find @xmath69 .",
    "figure [ fig : nh_u_285_abun2 ] shows the ionization solution for one velocity slice where @xmath69 .",
    "this value is representative to all our velocity slices , as we find 90% of the material in this velocity range to have @xmath70 .",
    "thus , the ionization parameter of the low ionization component deduced from the x - ray analysis is practically identical to the one deduced from the uv analysis .",
    "the high ionization x - ray component does not have any bearing on the uv analysis since this component is not expected to contribute measurable column density for the uv ions .",
    "this is easily verified by inspecting figure  [ fig : nh_u_285_c_nion ] .",
    "the relative fraction of the uv ions drops dramatically above @xmath69 .",
    "even the fraction of highest ionization uv species ( ) , is lower by more than two orders of magnitude for @xmath71 than for @xmath69 .",
    "how does the total @xmath72 for the low ionization x - ray component compare with our uv findings ? for the velocity range @xmath73  to @xmath38  we find from the uv analysis : total @xmath74 @xmath2 . in order to compare this value to the x - ray determined @xmath72 two factors have to be taken into account .",
    "first , the velocity interval of the uv analysis is only 80  out of the 340  of the entire uv trough .",
    "it is possible that the rest of the trough has different amount of @xmath72 per  on average , but in order to get a rough comparison we will simply multiply the above uv derived @xmath72 by 340/80 .",
    "second , the x - ray analysis was done assuming solar abundances . since the uv metalicity enhancement is a factor of 2.4 on average , we need to multiply the uv derived @xmath72 by this additional factor .",
    "accounting for both factors , we find that our rough x - ray equivalent @xmath72 is @xmath75 @xmath2 , which is compatible with the derived value for the low ionization x - ray component : @xmath60 @xmath2 .",
    "it is remarkable that that the fully independent x - ray and uv ionization solutions agrees so well for the mrk  279 absorber .",
    "finally , we address the issue of whether our uv derived abundances are compatible with the x - ray analysis . in principal",
    ", it is very difficult to derive absolute abundances from the x - ray data since there are no hydrogen lines in the x - ray band .",
    "therefore , the x - ray data are insensitive to simple metalicity scaling and it is not surprising that costantini et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) find solar metalicity to be adequate for their models .",
    "barring a handle on the absolute abundances we look at secondary effects involving ratios of nitrogen to carbon .",
    "our uv findings show that the outflow s ( n / c)@xmath76(n / c)@xmath77 .",
    "the best x - ray measurements are those of  and . from table 5 in costantini et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) we find that the modeled is virtually identical to the measured .",
    "however , the measured  column density : @xmath78)_{\\rm obs}=16.9\\pm0.6 $ ] @xmath2 is higher than the modeled one @xmath78)_{\\rm model}=16.3\\pm0.36 $ ] @xmath2 .",
    "( although the error bars on the two values make them formally consistent with each other ) .",
    "although the measurements and modeling errors are large , the x - ray data are consistent with a relative enhancement of ( n / c ) compared solar , similar to the one deduced from the uv data .",
    "this consistency strengthens our uv abundances findings .",
    "we argue that the work described here is the first reliable abundance determinations in agn outflows .",
    "to support this claim let us review what is necessary for deriving reliable abundances in the outflows , and how well this project met these requirements . in   5.3 we describe how other previous and current efforts fall short of satisfying these necessary conditions .    determining the ionization equilibrium and abundances ( iea ) in an agn outflow depends crucially on obtaining reliable measurements of the absorption column densities ( @xmath14 ) from the observed troughs . as described in the introduction and elsewhere ( arav et  al .",
    "1999b ; de  kool et  al .  2001",
    "; arav et  al .",
    "2001a ; gabel et  al .",
    "2003 ; scott et al .",
    "2004 ) solving for the velocity - dependent covering fraction is crucial for obtaining reliable @xmath14 from the troughs .",
    "column densities inferred using other techniques ( curve of growth , apparent optical depth and gaussian modeling ) suffer from large systematic uncertainties and many times can only be used as lower limits .",
    "we have developed state - of - the - art velocity - dependent methods to determine the covering fraction of both the continuum and belr as well as the real optical depth ( gabel et  al .",
    "2005a and this work ) .",
    "to implement these methods a suitable data set must have the following attributes :    \\1 ) spectral resolution larger than 20,000 in order to allow for velocity - dependent analysis across the troughs .",
    "fuse and the echelle gratings on board hst give us sufficient resolution .",
    "\\2 ) to enable a meaningful covering factor analysis of the cno doublets , the s / n of the data must be @xmath79 for the above resolution . the reason for such high s / n is the need to quantify the differences between the residual intensities of two doublet troughs , which are often only 10 - 20% apart ( see gabel 2005a ) .",
    "very few data sets in the literature achieve this s / n level since it requires roughly @xmath80 hst / stis orbits and @xmath81 ks of fuse exposure time on the brightest agn outflow targets .",
    "\\3 ) the data set must cover troughs from enough ions to be useful for iea determinations . at the minimum we need to cover the cno doublets and three or more of the lyman series troughs .",
    "the latter is a crucial requirement since abundances can not be determined without an accurate measurement of  column density .",
    "only a combination of fuse and hst can cover the needed troughs .",
    "\\4 ) the troughs associated with different doublet components must be unblended .",
    "otherwise it is impossible to extract covering factors and the derived @xmath14 are reduced to lower limits .",
    "similarly , the outflow troughs can not be contaminated with significant galactic absorption .",
    "\\5 ) fuse and hst / stis coverage must be near - simultaneous , preferably within the same month .",
    "seyfert outflow troughs are known to show considerable changes over time scales of more than several months ( e.g. , ngc 3783 , gabel et  al .  2004",
    "; mrk 279 , scott et  al .",
    "any combined analysis of the full data set must rely on no changes in the absorption between the different epochs .",
    "the deep and simultaneous fuse and hst / stis observations of mrk  279 are the only existing data set that satisfies all these requirements . therefore , our measurements yield the first sufficient set of reliable @xmath14 to allow for a physical determination of the iea in agn outflows .",
    "our next step was to infer the physical conditions of the absorbing gas using these @xmath14 measurements .",
    "here we introduced an analysis method that uses the full information imprinted on these high - resolution data .",
    "( in parallel , gabel et  al .",
    "2006 used similar techniques on the vlt / uves spectrum of qso j2233 - 606 . ) instead of integrating the @xmath14 across a kinematic component we treat each resolution element separately .",
    "physically , this approach is justified since elements of the flow that are separated by more than several  represent physically - separated and sonically - disconnected regions . in this way , instead of having constraints on the physical conditions in one kinematic component , we obtain constraints on 15 separate regions .",
    "we therefore do not have to use the implicit assumption that the ionization equilibrium is constant across a given component .",
    "working at the spectral resolution of the spectrograph provide the maximum kinematical information without significant scattering between adjacent spectral elements .",
    "we also note that these spectrographs have very little instrumental scattered - light component ( howk & sembach 2000 )    we found considerable variation for @xmath11 and @xmath12 over the 15 velocity slices : @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "thus it is evident that `` classical '' kinematic components that often covers more than 100 , indeed show significant variation in @xmath11 and @xmath12 as a function of velocity .",
    "for one kinematic component given the set of measured @xmath14 , it is always possible to find a set of cno abundances that will produce a perfect photoionization solution .",
    "it is therefore impossible to assess the physical significance of such a solution .",
    "the situation is different for constraining 15 separate regions .",
    "we rely upon two plausible physical assumptions , that the individual @xmath11 and @xmath12 can vary from one region to another , and that the abundances across these regions is constant .",
    "this allows us to obtain tight constraints for the individual cno abundances as described in   3.4 .",
    "we spent a great deal of effort to derive physically meaningful errors on our @xmath14 measurements .",
    "it is a major achievement that the excellent statistical fit of our abundance model ( reduced @xmath84 ) was achieved without any re - adjustments of these errors .",
    "this not only validates our methods , but also the physical model we are using to analyze agn outflows .",
    "as described above , we invested a large effort in developing and utilizing analysis techniques that solved for two separate covering factors and the optical depth as a function of velocity .",
    "an important question in this context is how valid is the assumption of a rigid absorbing - material distribution ( essentially a step - function ) assumed by the partial covering model ?",
    "would an inhomogeneous distribution of absorbing material across the emission source ( de kool , korista & arav 2002 ) yield a good alternative to the partial covering model ? in arav",
    "et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) we tested inhomogeneous absorber models on the mrk  279 data set , where the three high quality ,  and  troughs provided the strongest constraints .",
    "we concluded that inhomogeneous absorber models that do not include a sharp edge in the optical depth distribution across the source are not an adequate physical model to explain the trough formation mechanism for the outflow observed in mrk  279 .",
    "this result supports the use of partial covering models for agn outflows .",
    "as stated above , the sed we use ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ) is arguably the best - determined one for an individual seyfert study .",
    "nonetheless , we do not cover the crucial 13.6150 ev ionizing part of the sed , and therefore there is inherent uncertainty that affects the photoionization models .",
    "the softest plausible sed is where we connect the last uv point with the first x - ray point ( see   2.2 ) with a simple power - law .",
    "this minimizes the assumptions regarding the shape of the unseen portion of the sed , but with the price of assuming a spectral break immediately following the last uv point .",
    "we ran photoionization models using such sed and found that the largest change was a decrease in the carbon abundance by @xmath4910% , with nitrogen and oxygen showing similar but smaller change .",
    "all iea studies of seyfert outflows prior to 2003 used @xmath14 measuring techniques that are inadequate for agn outflows troughs : curve of growth , apparent optical depth and gaussian modeling .",
    "the key importance of the covering factor was overlooked .",
    "therefore , the iea findings of these studies suffer from large unquantified systematic errors that can only be corrected to some extent by redoing the analysis using more accurate trough formation models . in many cases",
    "a reanalysis is unwarranted since one or more of the conditions detailed in   5.1",
    "is not met : s / n of the data is insufficient ( e.g. , fields at al 2005 ) ; data do not cover troughs from enough ions to be useful for iea determinations ( e.g. , brotherton et  al .",
    "2001 ) ; doublet troughs are blended ( e.g. , ngc 4151 , kraemer and crenshaw 2001 ) ; severe contamination with galactic absorption ( e.g. , ngc 3783 , gabel et  al .",
    "2003 ) ; fuse and hst / stis coverage is not simultaneous .",
    "a typical recent example is the study of the mrk 1044 outflow ( fields et  al .",
    "2005 ) , which has the following shortcomings : a ) s / n of the fuse data is too low to allow a covering - factor analysis .",
    "b ) there is severe contamination with galactic absorption in the fuse band , greatly affecting the measurements of the crucial  trough .",
    "c ) fuse and hst / stis observations were taken 6 months apart allowing significant changes in the absorber to occur , while it is necessary to assume that no absorption change occurred for the sake of the photoionization analysis .",
    "d ) there was no attempt to solve for the velocity dependent covering factor for the stis observed  and , which introduces large errors in their @xmath14 determination .",
    "e ) the main measured fuse lines ( ) are totally saturated , thus the derived  column density is only a lower limit .",
    "most importantly , the main conclusion , that the outflow shows a metalicity of at least 5 times solar is weakened by the fact that the lyman series troughs are either heavily blended ( ) , or of too poor quality ( ) for analysis . a possible factor of 3 increase in the  measurement is reasonable under these conditions and will make the photoionization model ( see their fig .",
    "5 ) consistent with solar metalicity .",
    "this paper presents a main result of a deep simultaneous uv and x - ray spectroscopic campaign on the agn outflow seen in mrk 279 , and is the fifth paper resulting from this campaign .",
    "our choice of object combined with the long observations ( 92 ks .  with fuse , 16 hst / stis orbits and 360 ks .",
    "chandra / letgs ) , allowed us to obtain the first reliable determination of chemical abundances in an agn outflow .",
    "we find that relative to solar the abundances in the mrk  279 outflow are : carbon 2.2@xmath00.7 , nitrogen 3.5@xmath01.1 and oxygen 1.6@xmath00.8 (   3 )    previous efforts to derive the abundances and ionization equilibrium of the outflows suffered from using inadequate models for the formation of the absorption troughs .",
    "therefore , their inferred ionic column densities are unreliable , and these uncertainties are then amplified by the photoionization models used to deduce the abundances and ionization equilibrium .",
    "much of the problem can be traced to the physical quantities that determine the shape of the observed troughs . in the ism and igm",
    ", the shape of absorption troughs singularly depends on the optical depth of the absorbing material .",
    "this allows for a straightforward extraction of the all - important ionic column densities .",
    "in contrast , agn outflow absorption troughs are a convolution of velocity dependent covering factor and optical depth .",
    "these two quantities must be de - convolved if one hopes to derive reliable column densities . to accomplish this",
    "a data set must have the following attributes(see   5.1 for full discussion ) : spectral resolution larger than 20,000 and s / n @xmath79 in order to allow for velocity - dependent analysis across the troughs ; spectral coverage of at least the cno doublets and three lyman series troughs , where the troughs associated with different doublet components must be unblended ; and near - simultaneous observations of all these troughs .",
    "we chose mrk  279 because it is by far the best agn outflow target in satisfying the above requirements .",
    "our deep campaign yielded the necessary high s / n data to do the analysis properly , and avoid many compromising assumptions that plagued previous studies . as a result we obtained the best determination of ionization equilibrium to date and the first reliable measurement of abundances in these environments .",
    "it is also the first time that the analysis of the uv data is in good agreement with the x - ray analysis .",
    "that is , the physical properties of the low ionization component seen in the x - ray match very well to those we find for the uv gas ( see   4 ) .    in order to extract the physics from the data we abandoned the old notion of `` absorption trough components . ''",
    "this notion is somewhat suitable for ism and igm clouds but is not adequate for studying dynamical absorption structures .",
    "instead , we developed velocity - dependent analysis technique , which proved crucial in deriving the results of this paper .",
    "we believe that these techniques are the only reliable way to determine the physical properties of agn outflows .",
    "this applies to both future uv observations , as well as ground based echelle spectroscopy of the outflows .",
    "this study demonstrates that the quality of science that can be achieved by a well designed campaign is far higher than the combined results of many small projects in this field . providing a strong argument for investing the large resources needed for such studies .",

    "i.e. , the continuum source ( @xmath85 ) and emission - line region ( @xmath86 ) . while the solution from this analysis matched the observed profiles well overall ( see figure 6 in g05 )",
    ", there were some systematic discrepancies indicating the need for a refinement in the fitting assumptions .",
    "given the crucial importance of having accurate ionic column densities with realistic uncertainties for photoionization modeling of the outflow , we re - address those measurements below .",
    "@xmath87 first , the continuum source was shown to be fully occulted by the outflow , with non - unity effective covering factors due entirely to partial coverage of the emission - line region .",
    "we consider this result to be robust : @xmath881 was found systematically over the numerous , independently fit velocity bins associated with the highly resolved absorption profiles , and it was found consistently in separate fits to the cno doublets and the lyman series lines .",
