    "during the last several decades , a number of large very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) surveys were conducted covering the frequency range between 2 and 100  ghz including the first space vlbi survey with the space radio telescope halca ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "vlbi surveys which have observed and produced images for more then 100 objects are summarized in table  [ t : vlbisurveys ] .",
    "we discuss below selected results from these surveys as well as their implications to the planned next generation science driven space vlbi mission vsop-2 @xcite .",

    "only a few of the sources have an overall radio structure which is almost unresolved even at the longest spacings .",
    "however , most of the observations do not have enough resolution to resolve structure across the jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the distribution of the measured brightness temperatures of the jet cores , calculated in the source frame , peaks around @xmath7  k and extends up to about @xmath8  k @xcite .",
    "this is close to the limit set by the dimensions of individual vlbi arrays .",
    "however , for many sources only a lower limit is determined .",
    "the observed values can be explained as the result of doppler boosting .",
    "it is important to note that the highest measurable value of the brightness temperature does not depend on the observing frequency ( see equation  ( 5 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "it depends on the physical length of the interferometric baselines as well as on the signal - to - noise ratio ( s.n.r . ) of vlbi measurements .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure  [ f : ang_limit ] as a dependence of the resolution limit versus s.n.r .",
    "calculated according to a criteria proposed by @xcite , equations  ( 1,2 ) .",
    "see for more discussion also @xcite .",
    "fractional linear polarization of the opaque quasar cores is generally low ( @xmath9% ) .",
    "extended jet features often show strong linear polarization ( up to @xmath10  per  cent ) indicating synchrotron radiation of optically thin regions with highly ordered magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "circular polarization , if any , is detected , in general , on the level less than 0.5% mostly in the cores @xcite .",
    "a vsop-2 experiment to measure brightness temperature of jet cores in a complete sample of agns could be valuable for statistical studies of the properties of extragalactic jets , for a population analysis of the jet orientation and other basic parameters like the doppler factor ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it should be taken into account , while planning such a survey , that the highest measurable brightness temperature does not depend on the wavelength of observations .",
    "it depends in turn on the interferometer baseline length and the s.n.r .",
    "( see   [ s : survey_results ] ) .",
    "an obvious conclusion is that 8  ghz observations involving vsop-2 space telescope and big ground - based dishes ( e.g. , evn ) will provide the highest sensitivity of the ground - space correlated - flux - density measurement being the most efficient configuration for such a survey .",
    "it is planned to implement a fast switching capability for the vsop-2 space radio telescope to allow phase referencing technique to be used for successful vlbi observations of weak targets .",
    "this is especially important at high radio frequencies which have a very limited coherence time of less then several minutes .",
    "we present here accumulated results of the search for compact extragalactic sources which are suitable as phase reference calibrators in vlbi experiments at or below 8  ghz @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f : skydist ] shows the sky coverage for more than 3000 calibrators while table  [ t : calprob ] provides a probability to find a calibrator within a given search radius .",
    "these results incorporate additional objects found in vlba surveys recently which were not included in the @xcite analysis .",
    "it can be immediately seen that a probability to find a phase calibrator required for vsop-2 observations at x - band ( 8  ghz ) within several degrees of the search radius is quite high for declination @xmath11 .",
    "it is important to note that the full list of calibrators includes a complete sub - sample of sources with integrated vlba flux density greater than 200mjy at 8  ghz and declination @xmath12 ( see for details * ? ? ?",
    "this means that there are almost no bright compact sources `` left '' in that region of the sky . in order to increase the calibrator source coverage in the declination range",
    "@xmath13 a dedicated vlba survey is proposed .",
    "the calibrator coverage south of declination @xmath14 will be increased by the australian lba survey started in february 2008 , this campaign will observe @xmath15 candidate sources ( p.i .",
    ": l.  petrov ) .",
    "the situation at 22 and 43  ghz is not so well advanced currently .",
    "only several hundred extragalactic objects were observed and imaged in the framework of the astrometric / geodetic program by @xcite .",
    "in addition to that , results of dedicated 22  ghz vlba survey of extragalactic sources with low galactic latitude will become available soon .",
    "however , 22 and 43  ghz observations of the complete sample of compact objects @xcite are needed in order to find more sources to be used as vlbi phase calibrators at these high radio frequencies .",
