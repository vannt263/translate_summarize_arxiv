    "the regular patterns which form when a dissipative , nonequilibrium system is driven just beyond the threshold of certain symmetry - breaking instabilities are in many ways analogous to the simple ordered phases which appear following equilibrium phase transitions@xcite .",

    "several fluid - dynamical systems undergo pattern - forming instabilities which are amenable to both theoretical and laboratory study .",

    "our objective in this paper is to carry out a realistic linear stability analysis for a different electrically driven instability , namely electroconvection in a thin , suspended fluid film .",

    "we have observed convection in films only a few molecules thick .",
    "our immediate goal is to understand the onset of electroconvection in this system .",

    "in fact , similar convective flows have been observed in thicker films of nematic and isotropic liquids @xcite . in these cases , however , surface tension effects and the convective flow itself cause thickness variations in the films , which make their behavior more complicated than that of the smectic films .",
    "the model we describe below is physically similar to a highly simplified one proposed by faetti , fronzoni and rolla@xcite for the  vortex mode \" convection they observed in nematic films , but our analysis is carried much farther .",

    "exceeds a critical value , the film convects in a pattern of vortices confined to the plane of the film .",
    "we neglect any effects of air drag by assuming that the film is suspended in vacuum .",
    "we will also treat the film as a weak ohmic conductor , and neglect any electrochemical charge production on the electrodes or in the bulk of the fluid .",
    "the currents involved are assumed to be sufficiently small that magnetic forces are insignificant .",
    "the body force responsible for driving any electroconvective flow results from an electric field acting on regions of nonzero charge density in the fluid . to analyze the electroconvection system we must first identify the mechanism which gives rise to regions of locally unbalanced charge in the fluid , and second , solve for the charges and fields selfconsistently , since",

    "however , the exterior field @xmath13 must have both parallel and perpendicular components just outside the free surfaces of the film .",
    "it can not in general be perpendicular to the surface because the surface is not an equipotential : the film is an ohmic conductor , so its surface potential varies linearly with the coordinate between the electrodes .",

    "the perpendicular component @xmath15 is proportional to the surface charge density @xmath16 at that location .",

    "this problem is solved analytically for thin films in two simple electrode geometries .",
    "we find that a  charge inversion \" is set up in the base state : the film has a positive charge density close to the positive electrode , and a negative charge density close to the negative electrode .",
    "this inverted charge distribution is sustained by the applied potential difference across the conductor  without a potential difference , the film surfaces are equipotentials , the component of the field parallel to the surface is zero , and thus there are no forces to drive convection , even if an electrostatic surface charge is present .",
    "this inverted base state configuration is analogous to the mass density inversion that arises in the bnard problem , and in section [ stability ] we show that it leads to a hydrodynamic instablity when the applied voltage is sufficiently large . unlike the density in the bnard problem , however , the charge density in the base state is a nonlinear function of position across the film .    by treating the film as two - dimensional",

    "the approximation that the film is a two - dimensional conducting sheet may be expected to break down for thick films for which @xmath19 . in this limit",
    ", surface forces may lead to significant shears and internal flows , as is apparently the case in thick nematic and isotropic films @xcite .",
    "diffusion on the much larger scale of the film width @xmath7 is also neglected .    in section [ stability ] , we describe the linear stability analysis for infinitesimal perturbations about the base state .",
    "the stability calculation is somewhat analogous to that for the bnard problem .",
    "dimensionless quantities @xmath0 and @xmath6 appear , which are analogous to the rayleigh and prandtl numbers . @xmath0 is proportional to the square of the applied voltage , while @xmath6 is the ratio of the thin film charge relaxation time to the viscous relaxation time .",
    "the differences between our calculation and the bnard problem are due to the additional coupling between the field and the charge density , which is also responsible for the nonlinearity of the base state charge density .",
    "the charge density and the field are analogous to the mass density and the gravitational acceleration in the bnard problem ; the new requirement that these also satisfy maxwell s equations amounts to requiring a nonlocal relation between the charge density and the electric potential .",
    "if we suppress this nonlocality by assuming these are simply proportional , the base state charge density becomes linear and our problem reduces completely to the bnard case .",
    "interestingly , this proportionality is nearly correct except near the edges of the film .    in section [ discussion ]",
