    "towards quantum state preparation , which clearly plays a key part in quantum information processing , recently several dissipation - based approaches have been proposed .",
    "the basic idea of those approaches originates from the trivial fact that a thermal environment drives any state to the stable ground state .",
    "however , it has been shown that we can sometimes _ engineer _ a desired dissipative environment such that the corresponding stable state is a nontrivial and useful one , e.g. , a highly entangled pure state @xcite .",
    "more specifically , under some conditions we are allowed to synthesize an open quantum system described by the markovian master equation @xmath1         + \\sum_{k=1}^m \\big (             \\hat l_k \\hat\\rho_t \\hat l_k^\\dagger              -\\frac{1}{2 } \\hat l_k^\\dagger \\hat l_k \\hat\\rho_t               -\\frac{1}{2 } \\hat\\rho_t \\hat",
    "l_k^\\dagger \\hat l_k \\big),\\ ] ] such that @xmath2 must converge into a given desired pure state @xmath3 ; that is , the hamiltonian @xmath4 and the dissipative channel @xmath5 are appropriately synthesized to achieve this goal .",
    "one of the main advantages of this approach is that the target state @xmath6 is clearly robust against any perturbation to the state @xmath2 during the dynamical process . in particular , it is independent on the initial state preparation .    in the finite dimensional case a necessary and sufficient condition for eq . to have a pure steady state",
    "was obtained in @xcite , and especially in @xcite the authors provided a sufficient condition for @xmath6 to be unique .",
    "the uniqueness characterization is of particular importance , because without such condition the desired convergence into the target state can not be guaranteed . for infinite - dimensional systems , on the other hand , in @xcite the author particularly focused on a general gaussian dissipative system and provided a complete parameterization of the system having a unique pure steady state .",
    "the merit of focusing on the class of gaussian systems lies not only in its importance in quantum information technologies @xcite but also in the fact that the parameterization is obtained in an easily - tractable manner in the phase space ; actually the uniqueness of @xmath6 can be readily checked by simply calculating the rank of a specific matrix , while in the finite - dimensional case @xcite we are required to verify that there is no specific subspace in the hilbert space .    in this paper",
    ", we study a gaussian system having a unique pure steady state in terms of a _ quantum stochastic differential equation _ ( qsde ) @xcite .",
    "the use of a qsde allows us to describe the dynamics of an open system in a form where the stochastic environment channels appear explicitly .",
    "the master equation is obtained as a result of averaging out all such stochastic effects brought from the environment .",
    "the contribution of this paper is twofold .",
    "the first one is that we clarify the physical meaning of the conditions for the gaussian system to have a unique pure steady state , which can not be clearly seen when dealing with only the master equation .",
    "this result is obtained through investigating the qsde of the corresponding ( complex ) _ nullifier_. in general , it is known that any pure gaussian state can be characterized as the common zero eigenstate of the corresponding nullifier operators @xcite ; this is the reason why investigating the full behavior of the nullifier provides new information about the dynamic process towards the target pure state .",
    "actually , we show that the nullifier dynamics of any gaussian system generating a unique pure steady state is _ passive_. as a byproduct , the result is used to show a certain trade - off between the closeness of the steady state to a target _ gaussian cluster state _ @xcite and the convergence time into that steady state .    in the previous result @xcite , although the mathematical characterization of the desired dissipative channel @xmath7 was obtained , its actual implementation was not discussed .",
    "actually , the resulting desired dissipative channels usually have to non - locally act on the system , and no general method to effectively implement such dissipative channels is known .",
    "the second contribution of this paper is to give a partial answer to the question of how to practically construct a desired dissipative system .",
    "the proposed scheme has a structure of _ quantum state transfer _ from light to a matter @xcite ; more specifically , a desired state of light is first generated and then that light field interacts with the oscillator system ( memory ) , which as a result acquires the desired state by dissipation .",
    "this scheme is indeed practical , because , as shown in @xcite , any pure gaussian cluster state of light can be effectively generated using some beam splitters and opos .",
    "note that the qsde approach actually has to be taken in order to explicitly describe the input light field .",
    "we use the following notations : for a matrix @xmath8 , the symbols @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 represent its hermitian conjugate , transpose , and elementwise complex conjugate of @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , respectively . for a matrix of operators , @xmath16 , we use the same notation , in which case @xmath17 denotes the adjoint to @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 denotes the @xmath20 identity matrix . @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    "denote the real and imaginary parts , respectively .",
    "in this section , a brief introduction to a gaussian system and its qsde representation is given .",
    "then we review the result of @xcite .",
    "a general @xmath23-mode bosonic system consists of @xmath23 subsystems with canonical conjugate pairs @xmath24 .",
    "denote the vector of total system variables by @xmath25 .",
    "the canonical commutation relation @xmath26=i \\delta _ { ij}$ ] then leads to @xmath27 now let @xmath28 be the density operator of this system and write the mean vector by @xmath29 and the covariance matrix by @xmath30 , where the mean @xmath31 is taken elementwise .",
    "note that the uncertainty relation @xmath32 holds .",
    "a gaussian state can be characterized by only the mean vector and the covariance matrix .",
    "a particularly important fact is that the covariance matrix @xmath33 corresponding to a pure gaussian state always has the following general representation @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are @xmath20 real symmetric and real positive definite matrices ( i.e. , @xmath37 ) , respectively . in other words , a pure gaussian state is completely parameterized by @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "an important merit of this representation is that the complex _ graph matrix _",
    "@xmath38 can be used for a graphical calculus for several gaussian pure states @xcite .",
    "in particular , a pure gaussian state @xmath39 having the covariance matrix always satisfies @xmath40 where the equation means that each entry of @xmath41 acts on @xmath39 .",
    "conversely , if a pure gaussian state @xmath42 satisfies @xmath43 , then we have @xmath44 .",
    "the vector of operators @xmath41 is called the _ nullifier _ for the pure gaussian state @xmath39 .",
    "a linear system is such that the hamiltonian @xmath4 and @xmath45-th dissipative channel @xmath7 in eq .",
    "are respectively characterized by @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 . for this system , the time - evolution of @xmath49 and @xmath50 with the state @xmath2 obeying eq .",
    "are given by @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath53 $ ] and @xmath54 with @xmath55 ( see @xcite for more detailed discussion ) . in this paper",
    ", we assume that the initial state of the dynamics is gaussian ; then , at any given time @xmath56 the state is also gaussian with mean @xmath49 and covariance @xmath50 , hence let us call such a linear system the gaussian system . a steady state of the gaussian system exists only when @xmath12 is a _ hurwitz _ matrix , i.e.",
    ", all the eigenvalues of @xmath12 have negative real parts . if it exists , the mean vector is @xmath57 and the covariance matrix @xmath58 is given by the unique solution to the following matrix equation : @xmath59      the situation we have in mind is that the system interacts with countable set of environment channels .",
    "the time - evolution of an observable of this open system is described in terms of a qsde .",
    "a most simple form of this equation is obtained when the environment channels are all independent vacuum fields with ideal markovian approximation taken .",
    "let @xmath60 be the annihilation operator of the @xmath61-th vacuum field ; then the markovian approximation means that @xmath60 instantaneously interacts with the system and satisfies the ccr @xmath62=\\delta_{ij}\\delta(t - s)$ ] .",
    "define the field annihilation process operator by @xmath63 , then this ccr leads to the following _ quantum ito rule _ : @xmath64 the system - field coupling in the time interval @xmath65 is described by the unitary operation @xmath66 $ ] , where @xmath67 is the system operator representing the coupling with the @xmath61-th vacuum field .",
    "then the system observable at time @xmath56 , @xmath68 , obeys the ito - type qsde @xmath69          + \\sum_{i=1}^m \\big (            \\hat l_i^ * \\hat x \\hat l_i            -\\frac{1}{2 } \\hat l_i^ * \\hat l_i \\hat x             -\\frac{1}{2 } \\hat x \\hat l_i^ * \\hat l_i \\big ) \\big)dt \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{5em }      \\mbox { }        + \\sum_{i=1}^m \\big (           j_t([\\hat x , \\hat l_i])d\\hat a_i^ *            - j_t([\\hat x , \\hat l_i^*])d\\hat a_i \\big ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where an additional system hamiltonian @xmath4 has been added . note that @xmath70 .",
    "the mean value @xmath71 is represented using the ( unconditional ) density operator @xmath2 by @xmath72 , which leads to the master equation .",
    "the change of the field operator can also be dealt with explicitly ; the output field @xmath73 after the interaction satisfies @xmath74    we are interested in the qsde whose system hamiltonian and dissipative channels are given by eq . .",
    "let us define @xmath75 , then the vector of system quadratures @xmath76 satisfies the linear qsde @xcite : @xmath77 where the system matrices @xmath12 and @xmath78 were defined in section 2 ( a ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the linear qsde actually leads to the time - evolutions of the mean and the covariance matrix : @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "also the output field equation of @xmath79 then becomes @xmath80      in @xcite , some conditions for a dissipative gaussian system to have a unique pure steady state were obtained .",
    "a particularly useful result from the environment engineering viewpoint is the following ( recall @xmath38 ) :    _ theorem 1 _ @xcite : let @xmath33 be a given covariance matrix of the form .",
    "then , this is the unique solution of eq . if and only if the system matrices are represented by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a complex @xmath83 matrix , @xmath84 is a real @xmath20 symmetric matrix , and @xmath85 is a real @xmath20 skew symmetric matrix ( i.e. , @xmath86 ) , and moreover , @xmath82 and @xmath87 satisfy the following rank condition : @xmath88    this theorem states that any dissipative linear system having a unique pure gaussian steady state is completely parameterized by the three matrices @xmath89 , and @xmath85 , which further have to satisfy the rank condition . in @xcite , this result was obtained through a fully algebraic treatment of eq . , and the physical meanings of the conditions were not discussed . as mentioned in section 1 , nevertheless , they will be clarified within the qsde framework ; for convenience of the later discussion , we note that @xmath90 satisfies @xmath91",
    "as seen in eq . , the pure state @xmath39 is the common zero - eigenstate of the nullifier vector @xmath92 . hence it is worth to see the time - evolution of @xmath93 , when the conditions shown in theorem 1 are satisfied .",
    "noting eqs . and , we have @xmath94 therefore , multiplying both sides of eq . by @xmath95 from the left",
    ", we have @xmath96 regarding the output process , as @xmath97 , it is written by @xmath98 the coefficient matrix of the dynamics of @xmath41 has the following property .    _ proposition 2 _ : the matrix @xmath99 is hurwitz if and only if the rank condition is satisfied .",
    "_ proof _ : let @xmath100 and @xmath101 be the eigenvector and the eigenvalue of @xmath99 , respectively ; i.e. , @xmath102 .",
    "then , multiplying this equation by @xmath103 from the left , we have @xmath104 where @xmath105 denotes the standard euclidean norm .",
    "this immediately yields @xmath106 .",
    "recall now that @xmath107 , hence @xmath108 is skew hermitian .",
    "therefore , adding the above two equations yields @xmath109 , and we have @xmath110 .",
    "let us here assume that @xmath111 .",
    "then , we have @xmath112 , and the matrix @xmath113 satisfies @xmath114 but this is contradiction to the assumption , thus @xmath115 . as a result , @xmath116 is strictly negative , implying that the matrix @xmath99 is hurwitz .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath117 is not of rank @xmath23 , there exists an eigenvector of @xmath99 , say @xmath118 , that satisfies @xmath119 .",
    "then , from the above discussion , the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath120 satisfies @xmath121 , hence @xmath122 is not hurwitz .",
    "@xmath123    based on the above result , we can verify that the target pure gaussian state is certainly generated . to see this ,",
    "let us multiply all the entries of the nullifier dynamics by the system - field composite state vector @xmath124 from the right ( @xmath125 is the vacuum state ) .",
    "then , due to the relation @xmath126 , we have @xmath127 the hurwitz property of the matrix @xmath99 is equivalent to asymptotic stability of the dynamics , thus the nullifier vector @xmath128 converges to zero . therefore , in the schrdinger picture",
    ", @xmath129 is the common zero - eigenstate of @xmath41 , meaning that the system state becomes the target pure gaussian state @xmath39 as @xmath130 .",
    "the hurwitz property obtained above allows us to obtain a specific input - output relation from the incoming field @xmath131 to the outgoing field @xmath132 , through eqs . and .",
    "for this purpose , it is convenient to move into the frequency domain where both of these field operators as well as the internal system variable @xmath133 are all fourier transformed .",
    "the fourier transformation of eqs . and",
    "are given by @xmath134 where the tilde notation denotes the fourier transformed operator .",
    "note that for instance @xmath135 is not the fourier transformation of @xmath136 but @xmath60 .",
    "also , more precisely , we should take laplace transformation @xmath137 and set @xmath138 to obtain the fourier transformation ; for the rigorous treatment , see @xcite . as a result",
    ", we have the input - output map from @xmath139 to @xmath140 : @xmath141 here we have used the hurwitz property to justify that the initial contribution of the system was ignored in eq . .",
    "the @xmath142 matrix @xmath143 , called the _ transfer function matrix _ , has a striking property as shown below .",
    "_ proposition 3 _ : the transfer function matrix @xmath143 is unitary for all @xmath144 .    _ proof _ : the proof directly follows from lemma 2 of @xcite , but here it is given for convenience of readers .",
    "first , to simplify the calculation , let us define @xmath145 and @xmath146 . as @xmath107 , @xmath147 is skew hermitian ; @xmath148 . with this notation ,",
    "the transfer function matrix is represented by @xmath149 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath150 here it follows from @xmath148 that @xmath151 substituting this expression for the last term of eq . , we end up with the relation @xmath152 , hence @xmath143 is unitary for all @xmath144 .",
    "@xmath123    this result states that the output power spectrum is flat in all the frequency domain , i.e. , @xmath153 .",
    "this means that , at steady state , it is impossible to extract any information about the internal system , as long as the matrix @xmath99 is hurwitz and the input fields are in vacuum or coherent states .",
    "now we arrive at the stage where the physical meanings of the conditions given in theorem  1 can be clarified .",
    "first of all , the structure of eqs . and as well as the above two propositions remind us that the dynamics of the nullifier is a generalization of that for the simple single - mode optical damped cavity whose qsde is described by @xmath154 where @xmath155 and @xmath156 denote the intra - cavity mode and the incoming vacuum field mode , respectively . @xmath157 and @xmath158 denote the detuning and the damping rate , respectively .",
    "clearly , the state evolves into the vacuum , and also we have @xmath159 for all @xmath144 , as in the nullifier case .",
    "these properties arise due to ( i ) that energy is not supplied through the hamiltonian , ( ii ) that the field does not supply energy but simply brings about the damping of the system , and ( iii ) that the system is asymptotically stable .",
    "mathematically , the first two statements mean that the dynamics does not contain the creation operators @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "actually , regarding the first one , if the cavity contains a degenerate parametric amplifier , which is described by the hamiltonian @xmath162 , then the qsde needs to be described in terms of both @xmath163 and @xmath164 . the last condition ( iii )",
    "guarantees that the state uniquely converges into the vacuum as well as that the output field does not contain any information about the system at steady state .",
    "systems having the properties ( i)-(iii ) are in general called _ passive systems _ @xcite .",
    "the above discussion implies that the nullifier dynamics is passive ; more precisely , we obtain the physical meanings of the conditions , , and as follows .    *",
    "the matrix @xmath78 has the form given in eq . so that the creation process @xmath165 does not appear in the qsde of @xmath93 ; as mentioned above , this is equivalent to that there is no energy supply from the environment to the nullifier .",
    "* the matrix @xmath90 has the form given in eq . so that the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath166 does not supply energy for the nullifier . *",
    "the rank condition implies that the coefficient matrix @xmath99 is hurwitz , or equivalently the asymptotic stability of the dynamics of the nullifier .",
    "this guarantees that the output power spectrum is flat in all frequencies , meaning that the output field does not contain any information about the system at steady state .",
    "the last statement can be understood by studying the _ filtering equation _",
    "@xcite , which enables us to update the conditional state based on the measurement result of the output field . in general ,",
    "when the state of the master equation reaches the steady state and it is pure , then the corresponding filtering equation is identical to the master equation , meaning that we do not obtain any new information through measuring the output field for updating our knowledge .",
    "note that this does not mean that the system is not controllable .",
    "we have seen in theorem 1 how the dissipative channel @xmath167 with @xmath168 should be chosen to engineer a desired gaussian dissipative system . when we aim to generate a certain ( useful ) gaussian state , however , it often turns out that the resulting @xmath7 has to possess a specific structure which is hard to actually implement .",
    "for instance , a dissipative channel interacting with all the nodes , i.e. , @xmath169 , will be hard to implement . in this section , for the specific case where the system is subjected to @xmath23 independent input optical fields ( i.e. , @xmath170 ) , we provide a practical procedure for implementing desired dissipative channels .",
    "let us first introduce the field quadratures ( @xmath171 ) @xmath172 which satisfy the canonical commutation relation @xmath173=\\delta_{ij}dt$ ] . then , defining @xmath174 and @xmath175 , we find that the qsde is rewritten by @xmath176 where @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",

    "this is the framework of the quantum state transfer @xcite ; in this case the system is called the _ memory _ and it should be independent on the input state we will transfer . more specifically , the target mode @xmath183 is obtained from the vacuum mode @xmath179 through the transformation @xmath184 where the symplectic matrix @xmath181 is given in eq . ;",
    "then the quantum ito rule gives @xmath185 implying that the covariance matrix of the input field @xmath183 is certainly @xmath186 ( in the rigorous sense this statement should be given in terms of the power spectrum density ; see @xcite ) . note that @xmath181 can contain a squeezing process , which was not included in the original qsde framework of hudson and parthasarathy @xcite ;",
    "see @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "now the system is written as @xmath187 where , as shown above , the new input field @xmath183 carries information of the target gaussian state .",

    "this readily implies that @xmath200 has to be of the form @xmath201 with @xmath158 a constant .",
    "then , @xmath202 has to be independent on @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "but as the ( 1,2 ) block matrix @xmath203 also has to be independent on @xmath35 and @xmath36 , thus this is the case for @xmath204 as well .",
    "then , @xmath205 is only allowed , hence we obtain @xmath206 . with these selection of @xmath207 and @xmath200 ,",
    "the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,1 ) block matrices of @xmath188 take @xmath208 and zero , respectively . as a result ,",
    "@xmath209 .",
    "next let us consider the matrix @xmath210 .",
    "from the above discussion , now we have @xmath211 , which leads to @xmath212 .",
    "this means that the matrix @xmath90 given in eq . must be independent on @xmath35 and @xmath36",
    "then , similar to the above discussion , by setting @xmath198 , we find that @xmath213 has to be independent on @xmath35 and @xmath36 . but this requirement is only satisfied when @xmath214 and @xmath215 ; as a result , we have @xmath216 .",
    "@xmath123    this proposition states that , in order to dissipatively generate a desired pure gaussian state in the state transfer setup , we are required to prepare identical and independent oscillators as memories .",
    "note that any pure gaussian cluster state ( see the next section ) can be effectively generated from the vacuum fields by applying suitably combined two - mode squeezing hamiltonians and beam splitters @xcite , hence the proposed scheme is practical .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the graph matrix @xmath189 can be used to capture several gaussian graph states in a convenient graphical manner .",
    "in particular , the so - called canonical gaussian cluster state @xcite , which plays an essential role in continuous - variable one - way quantum computation , corresponds to @xmath217 where @xmath35 is the symmetric adjacency matrix representing the graph structure of the cluster state ; for instance , the matrices @xmath218 represent the chain , t - shape , and square structures , respectively ( see figure 2 ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath219 corresponds to the approximation error of the state with covariance matrix to the ideal cluster state ; that is , bigger @xmath220 means that the state well approximates the ideal cluster state having the graph structure assigned by @xmath35 .",
    "( 250,70 ) ( 0,0 )     now , the nullifier dynamics is of the form @xmath221 and the real part of the eigenvalue of the coefficient matrix @xmath222 is @xmath223 , where @xmath224 is the corresponding eigenvector .",
    "this means that making @xmath220 bigger , or equivalently making the state more close to the ideal cluster state , renders the stability of the nullifier dynamics worse .",
    "another observation from a more practical viewpoint is as follows ; let us define the convergence time to the target by @xmath225 and denote the approximation error of the state to the ideal cluster one by @xmath226 .",
    "then , it is straightforward to find @xmath227 with @xmath228 a constant .",
    "therefore , in order to dissipatively generate a pure gaussian state that is very close to a desired cluster state , the convergence time has to be long .    more generally , as shown in @xcite , the matrices @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively correspond to the ideal and realistic parts of a gaussian graph state in the sense that the covariance matrix of @xmath229 is given by @xmath230 .",
    "that is , @xmath36 can be regarded as the approximation error in approximating the ideal graph structure @xmath35 .",

    ", this corresponds to setting @xcite : @xmath236 however , the dissipative channels are not easy to implement , since they are global and nontrivial coupling between the systems and the environment .    on the other hand , this dissipative system can be more easily implemented within the state transfer framework provided in section 4 , because we are only required to generate a two - mode squeezed state of optical fields and prepare two identical and independent oscillators .",

    "<S> recently the complete characterization of a general gaussian dissipative system having a unique pure steady state was obtained in [ koga @xmath0 yamamoto 2012 , phys . </S>",
    "<S> rev . a 85 , 022103 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this result provides a clear guideline for engineering an environment such that the dissipative system has a desired pure steady state such as a cluster state . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we describe the system in terms of a quantum stochastic differential equation ( qsde ) so that the environment channels can be explicitly dealt with . </S>",
    "<S> then a physical meaning of that characterization , which can not be seen without the qsde representation , is clarified ; more specifically , the nullifier dynamics of any gaussian system generating a unique pure steady state is passive . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , again based on the qsde framework , we provide a general and practical method to implement a desired dissipative gaussian system , which has a structure of quantum state transfer . </S>"
