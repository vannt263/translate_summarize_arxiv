    "these layers are used to generate @xmath22 spectrum for particle identification and to obtain total energy information for the stopped particles .",
    "each layer is divided into a number of pieces to obtain @xmath20 and @xmath21 information .",

    "the idea of using wavelength shifting ( wls ) optical fibres for scintillator read out was invoked for the present detector .",
    "earlier studies@xcite have shown that the double - clad fibres give better light yield ( 70% more light ) than comparable single clad ones , due to an increase in the fraction of light that undergoes total internal reflection .",
    "the double - clad wls optical fibres having 1 mm diameter were used for light transport .",
    "a number of grooves for fixing fibres to the scintillators were made on the surface of scintillators .",

    "the grooves cover roughly 40 % of the area of one face of scintillator . for the inner layer pieces , 15 grooves of 1.0 mm width and 1.5 mm depth",
    "were machined with a spacing of 1.5 mm .",
    "the machining was done at the central workshop , barc using a computer controlled 4 mm ( 1 mm for the grooves on inner layer pieces ) carbide cutter ( end - mill ) .",
    "a suitable cooling arrangement with chilled air was used in order to avoid any local heating .",
    "each piece of middle and outer layer has 76 fibres placed in 19 grooves ( 4 fibres in each groove ) , while each inner layer piece has 15 fibres ( 1 fibre in each groove .",
    "the scheme of fibre scintillator coupling is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sketch ] for a typical middle layer scintillator piece .",
    "+        the total amount of fibre used was 7.8 km in length .",
    "the fibre length for each scintillator pieces was decided on the basis of availability of space in the experimental area .",
    "while the length of fibre should not be very long in order to minimise attenuation losses , its bending radius should also be kept high .",
    "the conventional minimum bending radius of these fibres is ten times the fibre diameter . bending fibres below this radius",
    "may result in significant light loss due to damage in mechanical as well as optical properties .",
    "the length of fibres for each scintillator piece was optimized accordingly .",
    "since the light readout is from one end of the fibres only , the light traversing to the other end must be reflected back .",
    "therefore , before fixing the fibres , a highly reflective anodized aluminum sheet ( known as everbrite @xcite ) was placed on one face of the scintillator and held in place with aluminized mylar tape .",
    "a good surface finish and polished fibre ends are essential to prevent light losses at both the reflecting as well as at the readout interface .",
    "this has been achieved by different techniques .",
    "the cutting and polishing of fibres for the middle and outer layer pieces were done before fixing them to the scintillators . for polishing",
    ", many fibres were grouped together in bundles inside a perspex tube .",
    "the fibre face was cut along with the perspex by a diamond tipped cutting tool giving a surface finish of 0.7 @xmath30 m .",
    "the final polishing of these fibres was done with 0.3 @xmath30 m size alumina powder on velvet cloth .",
    "the polished fibres were fixed in the scintillator grooves with the bicron 600 optical cement at few locations along the grooves .",
    "however , to give an additional holding strength , five - minute epoxy was used wherever necessary .",
    "it is preferable to use the bicron cement as it has the same refractive index as that of the scintillator and its light transmission above 400 nm wavelength is more than 98 % . in addition",
    ", aluminized mylar tape was also used at few places for holding the fibres . for the inner layer pieces ,",
    "a different method was followed .",
    "first , the fibres were fixed in the grooves using bicron cement with a small amount of five - minute epoxy glue at the ends of the fibre - scintillator joint .",
    "this end of the scintillator along with the fibres were then polished for all 16 inner - layer pieces .",
    "this was done at the optics workshop of the spectroscopy division , barc by the lapping technique .",
    "fine alumina powder of 20 @xmath30 m , 12 @xmath30 m and 6 @xmath30 m were used in successive stages of lapping .",
    "the final finishing was then achieved by polishing with diamond paste and alumina of 1 @xmath30 m and 0.3 @xmath30 m sizes giving a surface finish of 0.3 @xmath30 m .",
    "[ scin ] ( left part ) shows the polished end of one of the scintillator pieces .",
    "finally the highly reflective everbrite sheet was placed at this polished end ( not shown in the figure ) for light reflection .",
    "the other open end of all the fibres of individual scintillator pieces were bundled together and then glued to the inside of a 2.54 mm diameter perspex tube - known as  cookie \" @xcite ( a cylindrical piece of acrylic , matching the photo multiplier tube in diameter ) .",

    "the wrapping by tyvek , apart from light reflection , also helps in minimising the cross - talk .",

    "they were simply held around the beam pipe / target chamber with tape .",
    "the other pieces of enstar i.e. , middle and outer layer pieces are relatively heavier and special support structures were designed and built for holding these pieces in place . the basic supporting structure , which is mostly an exoskeleton , was made from hylam ( low z material ) plates .",
