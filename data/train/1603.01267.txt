    "at least two reasons make the process @xmath2 interesting in the context of dark matter ( dm ) searches at the lhc .",
    "first , for leptonically decaying @xmath0 bosons , this process yields a distinct signature that can be searched for in dedicated analyses , which suffer from significantly less background than for instance mono - jet searches .",
    "second , hadronic @xmath0-boson decays will instead lead to a @xmath3 final state and therefore render an electroweak ( ew ) contribution to the mono - jet channel .",
    "these so - called mono-@xmath0 searches have received significant interest because they are potentially sensitive to the sign between the up - type and down - type quark couplings to  dm  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that two different diagrams contribute to this process and therefore interference effects can be important .",
    "indeed , lhc run i analyses  @xcite based on an effective field theory ( eft ) approach to parameterise the interactions of dm @xcite found a striking difference in the predicted fiducial cross sections between same - sign  ( ss ) and opposite - sign  ( os ) couplings . in the os case , leading to constructive interference between up - type and down - type quark contributions , the mono-@xmath0 results in fact turn out to set the strongest limits on the suppression scale of the unknown mediating interaction , surpassing the eft limits that arise from mono - jet searches . signal in @xmath4 data @xcite , upgrading their latest @xmath5 analysis @xcite . ] in direct detection experiments , on the other hand , os couplings lead to destructive interference and correspondingly smaller event rates , making the lhc a particularly promising probe for this scenario .",
    "subsequently , it has however been pointed out in @xcite that eft interpretations of mono-@xmath0 signals have issues with unitarity violation , if the effective higher - dimensional operators break the @xmath6 invariance of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "this is for example the case when considering pure vector dm - quark operators with os wilson coefficients for up - type and down - type quarks , as done in  @xcite .",
    "the enhancements of the mono-@xmath0 cross section found in these analyses is thus spurious , because it is due to the emission of longitudinal @xmath0 bosons .",
    "the eft study  @xcite has recently been extended in @xcite to the case of simplified models with @xmath7-channel exchange of a new coloured scalar .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that if these theories are formulated before ew symmetry breaking  ( ewsb ) in an @xmath6 gauge - invariant way , effects associated with isospin breaking are generically small .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that isospin - violating dm - quark couplings are not expected to increase the sensitivity of mono-@xmath0 searches in @xmath7-channel simplified models .",
    "it was also pointed out in @xcite that a similar solution is expected to be present in @xmath8-channel simplified models .",
    "the goal of this note is to fully develop the reasoning presented in  @xcite for @xmath8-channel dm models with vector or axial - vector mediator exchange . in section  [ sec : problem ] we demonstrate that a naive calculation of mono-@xmath0 signatures in spin-@xmath1 simplified models leads to unphysical predictions , in particular the violation of unitarity at large energies .",
    "we point out that this issue also affects mono - jet searches once ew corrections are included in the signal prediction . in section  [ sec : solution1 ] , we propose a simple solution to this problem based on imposing certain requirements on the coupling structure of the simplified model .",
    "a different solution is derived in section  [ sec : solution2 ] by considering mono-@xmath0 signatures in the sm , where the potentially dangerous terms are cancelled via interference with a diagram involving a triple gauge boson interaction .",
    "we discuss how this solution can be extended to simplified dm models . in  section",
    "[ sec : mixing ] it is then shown that this second solution is indeed the one naturally incorporated in @xmath9 models that obtain non - universal couplings to quarks from mixing with the sm gauge bosons . in  section  [ sec : solution3 ] , we briefly discuss how unitarity violation can be parameterised by non - renormalisable interactions .",
    "the main findings of this note are summarised in section  [ sec : summary ] , while the impact of ew corrections in an existing mono - jet search are studied in appendix  [ app : ewmonoj ] .",
    "in order to illustrate the issues that can appear in the calculation of mono-@xmath0 signals in simplified dm models , we consider a spin-1 mediator @xmath10 with mass @xmath11 and a dirac dm particle @xmath12 with mass @xmath13 .",

    "notice that the interactions ( [ eq : l_va ] ) also give rise to mono - jet signatures .",
    "there are in fact both qcd and ew corrections to jets  +  @xmath17 , which are exemplified by the middle and right diagram in figure  [ fig : diagrams ] , respectively .    the fundamental problem discussed in this paper",
    "is illustrated in figure  [ fig : metspectra ] , which shows the predicted @xmath18 spectrum for leptonically ( left panel ) and hadronically ( right panel ) decaying @xmath0 produced in association with an invisibly decaying @xmath9 .",
    "our event generation has been performed at leading order with madgraph5_amcnlo  @xcite starting from the implementation of the spin-@xmath1 simplified model presented in  @xcite and utilises nnpdf2.3 parton distribution functions ( pdfs )  @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath19 collisions at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath20 , employ @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and set all axial - vector and leptonic couplings to zero .",
    "the yellow curves in both panels correspond to ss couplings @xmath25 , while the red curves represent the os coupling choice @xmath26 .",
    "it is evident from the left plot in figure  [ fig : metspectra ] that the mono-@xmath0 predictions for the two coupling choices do not simply differ by a rescaling factor , but that the predicted differential cross sections are fundamentally different .",
    "most notably the @xmath27 spectrum in the os case is significantly harder than that for the ss choice .",

    ", one observes that the @xmath27 spectra for both processes are similar , but that the overall cross section for the qcd process  ( blue curve ) is significantly larger than that of the ew process  ( yellow curve ) , the latter amounting to a relative correction of a few percent only . in the os case ,",
    "on the other hand , we find the ew contribution  ( red curve ) to the differential cross section of @xmath29 to be harder and to dominate over the qcd process  ( green curve ) at sufficiently large @xmath18 values .",
    "this finding turns out to be essentially unaffected by the parton shower , hadronisation corrections and detector effects . for spin-@xmath1 simplified model realisations  ( [ eq : l_va ] ) with os couplings , the ew channel @xmath30 and not the qcd process @xmath31",
    "is therefore expected to give rise to the majority of events in the high-@xmath27 signal regions  ( srs ) of lhc run  i mono - jet searches .",
    "that this expectation is indeed correct is shown in appendix  [ app : ewmonoj ] .    the paradoxical observation that an ew contribution appears to produce harder mono - jet events than a qcd process casts doubt on the validity of the spin-@xmath1 simplified model introduced in ( [ eq : l_va ] ) .",
    "indeed , we will show below that the harder @xmath27 spectrum in the os case is due to contributions that grow with energy and therefore potentially violate unitarity .",

    "it is well - known that the production of longitudinal gauge bosons ( such as @xmath33 ) from fermions can potentially violate unitarity at large energies ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "for example , it was shown in  @xcite that for the spin-@xmath1 simplified model considered in ( [ eq : l_va ] ) the process @xmath34 violates unitarity at large energies for non - zero axial - vector couplings , unless a second dark higgs is added to the theory .",
    "since the amplitude is proportional to the fermion mass , the corresponding process with light quarks only violates unitarity at very large energies and can therefore be disregarded .",
    "the process @xmath35 , however , can lead to much lower scales of unitarity violation .",
    "following  @xcite , we calculate the helicity matrix elements for the case of a left - handed up - quark and a right - handed anti - down quark ( both of which are charged under @xmath6 ) .",
    "since the initial state has a total spin of 1 , the process can not proceed at @xmath8-wave  ( @xmath36 ) . for the @xmath37 partial wave ( or @xmath38-wave ) , we find in the limit @xmath39 @xmath40 with @xmath41 the @xmath6 gauge coupling and @xmath42 the mass of the @xmath0 boson .",
    "the helicity matrix element is found to grow proportional to @xmath8 at large energies .",
    "for @xmath43 it will therefore violate the requirement for perturbative unitarity , @xmath44 . with @xmath45 denoting a transversal @xmath9 boson scales as @xmath46 in the high - energy limit . in consequence , the resulting mono-@xmath0 cross section does not grow with @xmath8 , but becomes a constant in the @xmath47 limit .",
    "compared to the purely longitudinal contribution ( [ eq : m1 ] ) , transversal modes thus provide only a subleading source of unitarity violation . ]    in the ss case with vanishing axial - vector couplings , one finds for the combination of couplings appearing in ( [ eq : unitarityviolation ] ) that @xmath48 and hence the potentially unitarity - violating term vanishes identically . for os couplings ,",
    "on the other hand , one has @xmath49 , if the axial - vector couplings are zero .",
    "the resulting mono-@xmath0 and mono - jet cross sections then grow proportional to @xmath8 , which explains both the large enhancement of the total fiducial cross section and the harder @xmath18 spectrum observed in section  [ sec : problem ] for the os case .",
    "the most obvious way to avoid this problem is to simply impose the requirement @xmath50 on the coupling structure of the spin-@xmath1 simplified model ( [ eq : l_va ] ) . in order to understand this requirement intuitively ,",
    "let us rewrite the left - handed and right - handed couplings in terms of vector and axial - vector couplings .",
    "for the sign conventions adopted in ( [ eq : l_va ] ) , one obtains @xmath51 in terms of left - handed and right - handed couplings , the requirement ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) hence simply becomes @xmath52 ,  i.e.  left - handed up - type and down - type quarks should couple in the same way to the @xmath9 mediator .    notice that the latter requirement would be automatically fulfilled , if one wrote the quark couplings to the spin-@xmath1 mediator in such a way so as to preserve the ew symmetry , @xmath53   \\nonumber \\\\ & -\\sum_{q } \\ , z^\\prime_\\mu   \\ , g_q \\hspace{0.5 mm } \\bar{q}_l   \\hspace{0.25 mm }   \\gamma^\\mu \\hspace{0.1 mm }   q_l\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the left - handed quark doublet and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the right - handed quark singlets .",
    "each quark flavour has couplings described by the three parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and one can arrange for any desired relative sign between either the vector or axial - vector couplings , but can not choose them independently from one another . ,",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "for example , to be consistent with minimal flavour violation , the same couplings should be chosen for all three quark families  @xcite .",
    "moreover , models with non - zero axial - vector couplings ( i.e.  @xmath60 or @xmath61 ) require additional structure in the higgs sector , which may lead to strong constraints from higgs measurements or ew precision observables  @xcite . ]",
    "it is however conceivable that the coupling structure of the @xmath9 boson is modified by ewsb and that the spin-1 mediator ends up coupling differently to left - handed up - type and down - type quarks . in this case , the unitarity issue of amplitudes like @xmath62 needs to be solved in a different fashion .",
    "in the previous section , we have shown that unitarity violation in the process @xmath63 can be avoided if we require that the @xmath9 couples with equal strength to left - handed up - type and down - type quarks .",

    "indeed , when considering only the two @xmath7-channel diagrams shown on the left - hand side and in the middle of figure  [ fig : wzdiagrams ] the resulting amplitude grows with energy . in the sm ,",

    "in particular , the sm @xmath112 vertex ( [ eq : lwwz ] ) will lead to @xmath92 interactions . since the triple gauge boson vertex arises from the non - abelian @xmath6 , the induced coupling turns out to be proportional to @xmath113 and of the form ( [ eq : twwv ] ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath92 interaction is therefore precisely that given in  ( [ eq : solution2 ] ) . as discussed in section  [ sec : solution2 ] , the unitarity issue of the @xmath62 channel is then solved by the interference of the two diagrams with @xmath7-channel quark exchange and the single graph involving a @xmath8-channel @xmath0 boson .",
    "it is also important to realise that in the class of models discussed in this section , the mono-@xmath0 channel in addition receives a contribution from @xmath114 , since the sm @xmath64-boson field  @xmath100 inherits the direct dm couplings @xmath115 and @xmath116 from the interaction field @xmath94 through mixing .",

    "the mono-@xmath0 problems thus does not preclude meaningful calculations within the eft parameterisation ( [ eq : eft ] ) , provided the scale @xmath131 is sufficiently large .",
    "in fact , one can translate the bound ( [ eq : unitarityviolation ] ) into a limit on the new - physics scale @xmath131 for a given partonic centre - of - mass energy : @xmath140 this means for instance that if one wants to study a model with @xmath21 , one needs to impose @xmath141 in order to ensure that the model does not violate perturbative unitarity up to @xmath142 .",
