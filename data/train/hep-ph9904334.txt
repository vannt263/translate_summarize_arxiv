    "the first results are expected soon .",

    "have been already placed on both scalar and tensor terms @xcite this paper considers vector terms only .",
    "the influence of the vector contact interactions on the @xmath5 nc dis cross - section can be described as an additional term in the tree level @xmath6 scattering amplitude  @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mandelstam variable describing the four - momentum transfer between the electron and the quark , @xmath9 is the electric charge of the quark in units of the elementary charge and the subscripts @xmath10 and @xmath11 label the chiralities of the initial lepton and quark respectively : @xmath12 . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are electroweak couplings of the electron and the quark @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the third component of the su(2 ) isospin for the fermion @xmath17 : @xmath18 .    for processes such as @xmath19 or @xmath20 , a corresponding formula can be written for the @xmath21 tree level amplitude : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the center - of - mass energy squared of the four - fermion reaction .",
    "the sign of the contact interaction contribution to the @xmath23-channel amplitude ( [ eq - ms ] ) is the same as for the @xmath24-channel amplitude ( [ eq - mt ] ) .",
    "however , the standard model amplitude changes its sign due to the opposite signs of @xmath23 and @xmath24 variables .",
    "it is therefore important to notice that the resulting sign of the interference terms in the cross - section for @xmath25 scattering is different from that in @xmath26 or @xmath27 scattering .",
    "the contact interaction coupling strength @xmath28 can be related to the mass scale @xmath29 of new physics through the formula : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the unknown coupling strength of new interactions . as the contact interaction contribution always depends on the @xmath31 to @xmath29 ratio , it is convenient to consider the effective mass scale @xmath32 defined through the formula : @xmath33 which corresponds to the choice @xmath34 .      in the most general case ,",
    "vector contact interactions are described by 4 independent couplings for every lepton - quark pair . with only 2 lepton ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) and 5 quark flavours ( i.e. neglecting @xmath24 quark contribution )",
    ", we still have 40 independent couplings .",
    "it would be very difficult , if not impossible , to consider the model with 40 free parameters",
    ". however , some of these parameters ( couplings ) are weakly constrained by existing experimental data . to reduce the number of the free model parameters , weakly constrained couplings",
    "can be either neglected or additionally constrained by relating them to some other couplings .",
    "most of existing experimental data is sensitive predominantly to electron - up and electron - down quark couplings .",
    "therefore , the first model considered in this analysis is the one assuming that these 8 couplings ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) can vary independently , whereas other couplings ( for @xmath23 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath24 quarks and/or @xmath36 , @xmath47 leptons ) are assumed to vanish .",
    "this case will be referred to as * the general model*.    the other possibility is to impose additional relations between couplings .",
    "the common choice is to assume lepton universality : @xmath48 and quark family universality : @xmath49 lepton universality allows us to include data on muon pair production at the tevatron ( see section [ sec - dy ] ) , whereas assuming quark family universality significantly improves the constraints which we can obtain from lep2 measurements ( see section [ sec - lep ] ) . as a result , experimental constraints on contact interactions can be significantly improved without increasing the number of free model parameters .",
    "the model assuming relations ( [ eq - lu ] ) and ( [ eq - qu ] ) will be referred to as * the model with family universality*.      another commonly used assumption about lepton - quark contact interactions is that they satisfy the @xmath50 gauge invariance of the standard model . assuming that left - handed electrons and quarks belong to @xmath51 doublets and that the contact interaction lagrangian ( [ eq - lagr ] ) respects the @xmath51 symmetry implies a relation between contact terms involving left - handed @xmath52 and @xmath53 quarks @xcite : @xmath54 which reduces the number of free model parameters from 8 to 7 .",
    "the @xmath50 also relates @xmath1 contact interaction couplings with those of @xmath55 interactions @xmath56 this allows us to use , in the study of @xmath1 contact interactions , additional data on nc neutrino scattering ( see section [ sec - le ] ) .",
    "moreover , assuming the @xmath50 universality introduces a related contact interaction term in the charged current process @xmath57 .",
    "the coupling constant for the induced charged current contact interaction is @xmath58 this relation allows us to use , in the study of neutral current contact interaction , also data from charged current processes ( see section [ sec - hera ] and [ sec - le ] ) .",
    "the model assuming the @xmath50 universality will be referred to as * the su(2 ) model*. in order to reduce the number of models , the su(2 ) models considered in this analysis always assume lepton and quark family universality .",
    "using data from a single experiment it is mostly not possible to put significant constraints on contact interaction scales in the general case .",
    "therefore it is a common practise to consider particular models , which assume fixed relations between the separate couplings , reducing the number of free parameters to one .",
    "for example , the so called vector - vector model assumes that all couplings are equal : @xmath59 mass scale limits obtained in one - parameter models are , artificially , much stronger than in the general model .",
    "they will be considered in this analysis to allow comparison with other results .",
    "the relations between couplings assumed for different models are listed in table [ tab - models]@xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that all one - parameter models considered assume @xmath60 for @xmath61 , to avoid strong limits coming from atomic parity violation measurements ( see section [ sec - le ] ) .",
    "for all one - parameter models quark and lepton family universality is assumed .",

    "in this appendix a simple `` toy model '' is used to demonstrate that the probability function , as introduced in section [ sec - method ] , should not be treated as the probability distribution for @xmath76 .",
    "let us consider a model with n independent couplings .",
    "assume that all data considered in the analysis are in perfect agreement with the standard model and that the resulting probability function is @xmath250 where @xmath251 and the distribution width @xmath145 is taken to be the same for all couplings .",
    "the standard model gives the best description of the data , corresponding to the maximum value of @xmath161 .",
    "consider the cross - section deviation from the standard model prediction , which is of the form @xmath252 if @xmath161 is taken as a probability distribution , then the probability distribution for @xmath181 should be calculated from equation ( [ eq - oldprob ] ) . after integrating over the coupling space we obtain : @xmath253 the shape of @xmath180 corresponds to that of the @xmath254 distribution for n degrees of freedom .",
    "for @xmath255 , @xmath180 has a maximum for @xmath256 , i.e. for the standard model expectation .",
    "however , for models with @xmath257 parameters , the maximum of @xmath180 is shifted towards @xmath258 and the probability of the standard model solution @xmath259 .",
    "this results is incompatible with our initial assumption that all data are in perfect agreement with the standard model .",
    "the above calculation , based on the formula ( [ eq - oldprob ] ) , is not correct because it assumes that @xmath161 is the probability distribution for @xmath76 .",
    "we can treat @xmath161 as the probability distribution only if we assume that @xmath76 has a flat prior distribution .",
    "this assumption justifies limit setting procedure described in section [ sec - met - lim ] ( formula ( [ eq - elimit2 ] ) ) .",
    "however , it does not justify variable transformation from @xmath76 to @xmath181 ( resulting from equation ( [ eq - oldprob ] ) ) , as the prior distribution for the new variable does not need to be flat . instead , one should try to define @xmath180 in the same way as @xmath161 , i.e. as the probability that our data come from the model predicting deviation @xmath181 .",
    "this approach results in formula ( [ eq - newprob ] ) . for our toy model",
    "the probability of observing deviations from the standard model predictions is @xmath260 where the normalisation condition ( [ eq - pmax ] ) has been imposed .",
    "the result does not depend on the number of free model parameters and the most probable model is the one predicting no deviation from the standard model ( taking into account that @xmath261 ) .                          the cdf collaboration , f.abe et al .",
