    "<S> these spectroscopic studies reveal that the substituted co ions play several roles of hole doping for mn , ferromagnetic superexchange coupling between the co@xmath3 and mn@xmath4 ions , and orbital magnetism of the co@xmath3 ions . </S>",
    "<S> competition among these complex interactions produces the unique electronic and magnetic behaviors including enhanced coercivity of the co - doped pr@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 . </S>"
