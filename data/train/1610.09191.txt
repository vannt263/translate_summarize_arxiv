    "orbital ordering in the perovskite - based mangenites is typically coupled to the lattice through jahn - teller distortions of the oxygen octahedra , and often accompanied by mn@xmath3/mn@xmath4 charge ordering as well as antiferromagnetic ordering patterns .",
    "much of this phenomenology is also encountered among the members of the quadruple perovskite manganites family amn@xmath5o@xmath1 , where a is a 2 + or 3 + cation , which were additionally shown to display interesting dielectric and multiferroic properties  @xcite .    within this family ,",
    "camn@xmath0o@xmath1 has recently attracted a lot of scientific attention due the observation of huge , magnetically - induced ferroelectric polarization ( 2870 @xmath6cm@xmath7 for a single crystal )  @xcite .",
    "earlier x - ray and neutron scattering studies have revealed that camn@xmath0o@xmath1 undergoes upon cooling a sequence of phase transitions associated with charge , orbital and spin ordering .",
    "while at high temperatures camn@xmath0o@xmath1 crystallizes in a distorted perovskite cubic structure ( space group im@xmath8 ) , at t@xmath9@xmath10440 k a first - order structural phase transition takes place towards the rhombohedral r@xmath8 structure ( for the followings we will use the hexagonal setting of the r@xmath8 space group )  @xcite .",
    "this transition relates to the jahn - teller mn@xmath11 cations of the mno@xmath12 perovskite octahedra ( four in each formula unit ) and coincides with their simultaneous charge ordering in three mn@xmath3 and one mn@xmath4 , occupying non - equivalent sites in the low temperature hexagonal structure . upon further cooling , an incommensurate structural distortion with the propagation vector q@xmath13=(0 , 0 , 2.077 ) sets in below t@xmath2=250 k , involving a variation of the mn@xmath3-o bond length in the ab - plane  @xcite .",
    "orbital ordering of the mn@xmath3 cations , following a periodic modulation of the occupation of the 3x@xmath14-r@xmath14 and the 3y@xmath14-r@xmath14 orbitals , was inferred from the modulated mn@xmath3-o bond lengths  @xcite .",
    "ferroelectricity appears below t@xmath15=90 k , simultaneously with the antiferromagnetic ordering of the manganese magnetic moments .",
    "the modulation wavevector of the observed helical magnetic pattern locks - in to the one of the preceding orbital - ordering , q@xmath16=q@xmath13/2 , resulting in an intertwined magneto - orbital helix  @xcite .",
    "the observed magnetic structure was suggested to arise from the effect of the orbital modulation on the magnetic exchange interactions  @xcite .",
    "the simultaneous apparition of a huge electric polarization perpendicular to the spin rotation plane of the helical structure has been attributed to the coupling between the magneto - orbital helix and the global structural rotation  @xcite . however , very recently doubts were reported concerning the appearance of an intrinsic ferroelectric polarization in this compound  @xcite . finally , below t@xmath17=48",
    "k another magnetic transition takes place , described by multiple distinct magnetic propagation vectors  @xcite        motivated by the importance of the structural modulation and the associated orbital order for the stabilization of the magneto - orbital helix and the emergence of magnetically - induced ferroelectricity , we investigated the lattice dynamics across the transition at t@xmath2 .",

    "the momentum width of the phonon anomaly is compatible with both momentum - dependent electron - phonon coupling as well as competing interactions ( or `` frustration '' ) as the driving force for the incommensurate modulation .",

    "the linewidths of the observed peaks are not resolution limited , therefore we can not exclude that each peak consists of more than one unresolved phonons . focusing on the lowest energy optical phonon branch , a pronounced softening from @xmath1910 to @xmath192.5 mev is observed upon approaching q@xmath13 from the ( 3 3 3 ) brillouin zone center ( see fig .",

    "the temperature dependence of the soft phonon upon approaching t@xmath2 from above is traced in fig .",
    "[ fig2]-d .",
    "in contrast to the expected anharmonic phonon hardening at low temperatures , the low energy optical phonon at q@xmath13 continuously softens from @xmath195 mev at 430 k to less than @xmath191.75 mev at 275 k , appearing at this temperature as a broad quasielastic peak merged with the elastic line ( within the experimental energy resolution ) .",
    "below 275 k the quasielastic peak dominates the ixs spectra and below t@xmath2 the strong superstructure peak of the modulated structure prevents any low energy phonon observation .",
    "the temperature dependence of the extracted low energy phonon dispersion is summarized in fig .",
    "the dip at q@xmath13 is present throughout the whole studied temperature range , starting from a @xmath191.8 mev softening at 400 k , and therefore 150 k above the transition temperature t@xmath2 , and increasing up to @xmath193.5 mev at 275 k.    we note at this point that for temperatures higher than 440 k the ixs phonon spectrum changes drastically ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] for t=460 k ) , signaling the structural transition to the high temperature cubic im@xmath8 phase .",
    "similar changes in the phononic spectra above 440 k have been reported in earlier raman , infrared and thz spectroscopic studies  @xcite .",
    "our ixs data in the temperature range 440 - 490 k show no soft phonon behavior in the high temperature phase , in agreement with the previously reported first order character of this jahn - teller driven structural phase transition  @xcite .",
    "in the canonical description of soft - phonon driven displacive phase transitions , the energy of a phonon of the high temperature and high symmetry phase continuously decreases ( softens ) upon cooling towards the transition temperature t@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the phonon energy ( frequency ) follows : @xmath23 with @xmath24=0.5 within the mean - field picture . at",
    "t@xmath2 the phonon energy reaches zero and therefore the restoring force against the phononic distortion vanishes and the atomic displacements associated with the soft phonon mode freeze in the structure of the low temperature and low symmetry phase .",

[ fig5 ] ) , and disappears above t@xmath2 . while the finite momentum of the orbital order does not allow the observation of the soft phonon mode in the raman spectra above t@xmath2 , our momentum resolved results offer direct evidence that the transition at t@xmath2 is due to a soft phonon lattice instability . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the first experimental evidence for a soft phonon driven orbital order in a magnanite .     and the red symbols are the results of the current ixs study above t@xmath13 .",
    "the solid lines represent power low fits to the experimental data ( see discussion in main text ) . ]    in metallic systems , incommensurate charge density waves ( cdw ) are usually understood as `` nesting''-driven fermi surface instabilities , with the nesting wavevector selecting the cdw wavevector q@xmath28  @xcite , which in the presence of electron - phonon coupling lead to kohn anomalies in the vibrational spectra  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it has been argued that strongly q - dependent electron - phonon coupling , instead of fermi surface nesting , could be the driving force for the incommensurate charge ordering and the one dictating the ordering wavevector  @xcite .",
    "for the well studied classic cdw system nbse@xmath29 , it has been claimed that the experimentally observed phonon anomalies allow to distinguish between the two possible cdw mechanisms , since the extended q - width of the phonon renormalizations is not in line with the sharply localized dips expected in a fermi surface nesting picture  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the phonon softening in the ixs data of camn@xmath0o@xmath1 appears to be relatively broad in momentum space , with a q - width ( at half - depth of the conical dispersion ) of @xmath190.4 r.l.u .",

    "a significant softening amplitude ( 18% of the phonon energy ) is observed even 0.2 r.l.u .",
    "away from q@xmath13 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . in the case of insulating systems , such as camn@xmath0o@xmath1 ,",
    "incommensurate lattice distortions are typically considered as a result of competing interactions , like long range coulomb interactions or short range exchange interactions which favor different periodicities  @xcite , or some form of geometric frustration  @xcite . from the lattice dynamics point of view , in the classic ionic insulator k@xmath29seo@xmath31 , phonon anomalies centered around the incommensurate wavevector were found to span over the bigger part of the brillouin zone  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , microscopic mechanisms involving strongly momentum - dependent electron - phonon coupling , similar to the cdw mechanism described above for metallic systems , may also be relevant for insulators and would produce phonon anomalies with a momentum width tightly linked to the wavevector dependence of the electron - phonon coupling  @xcite .",
    "therefore , whereas a competing interactions approach would be relevant in this jahn - teller distorted system , a q - dependent electron - phonon coupling could also account for the observed momentum range of the softening in camn@xmath0o@xmath1 , or contributions from both mechanisms should be taken into consideration .",
    "regarding the nature of the soft phonon mode , in the absence of non - magnetic lattice dynamical calculations we can not associate it to a specific atomic displacement pattern . nevertheless , given that the transition is of second order and soft phonon driven , it is natural to associate the frozen phonon displacement pattern to the low temperature modulated structure . moreover",
    ", a comparison of the ixs spectra with the zone center phonons shows that , while in the r@xmath8 structure there are no raman active modes below @xmath1922 mev  @xcite , the observed ixs phonon energies match well with the reported infrared vibrations at @xmath1911.4 , 12.8 and 18 mev  @xcite .",
    "the same infrared study combined with neutron scattering data , reports the possible coupling of polar phonon and spin modes ( `` electromagnons '' ) below the magnetic ordering temperatures t@xmath15 and t@xmath17  @xcite .",
    "anomalies in the temperature dependence of the frequencies and linewidths have also been reported for the raman active phonon modes upon entering the magnetically ordered states .",
    "while these could be related to anomalies in the lattice parameters across the magnetic transition at t@xmath17  @xcite , in the absence of structural anomalies across t@xmath15 the phonon anomalies across t@xmath15 were attributed to direct spin - phonon coupling  @xcite . moreover",
    ", a recent density functional theory study based on the experimental magnetic structure showed the existence of unstable modes in a large part of the brillouin zone and indicated the major contribution of a@xmath32 symmetry raman type lattice distortions in the low temperature ferroelectric polarization  @xcite .",
    "while the current ixs study has been limited to temperatures above t@xmath13 , a future momentum resolved phononic study across the magnetic transitions would provide further valuable insights regarding the lattice contribution in their microscopic mechanism .",
    "in summary , we investigated the phase transition mechanism of the incommensurate charge and orbital ordering in camn@xmath0o@xmath1 , through a detailed temperature dependent study of the lattice dynamics by means of momentum resolved inelastic x - ray scattering . in our preparatory diffuse scattering measurements",
    "we observe intense diffuse features at the superstructure positions of the incommensurate structure , already well above the orbital ordering temperature t@xmath2 .",
    "inelastic x - ray scattering scans across these features reveal a pronounced optical phonon softening centered around the superstructure positions .",
    "the softening increases continuously as t@xmath2 is approached from above following a canonical power law , and therefore unambiguously establishing that the phase transition is of second order and soft - phonon driven .",
    "the observation of the phonon anomaly over a broad momentum regime appears compatible with microscopic mechanisms of the incommensurate modulation deriving from q - dependent electron - phonon coupling and also from competing interactions in this jahn - teller distorted insulator .",
