    "nitrogen vacancy ( nv@xmath0 ) center diamonds have recently become the subject of intense research for emergent quantum technologies such as metrology , including nanoscale sensing @xcite ; magnetometry @xcite ; and single - spin nmr @xcite .",
    "since nv@xmath0 spin is extremely sensitive to changes in the magnetic field , nv@xmath0 center diamonds can be used to detect paramagnetic objects optically and nondestructively . ideally , it is even possible to detect a single spin .",
    "nv@xmath0-based devices can be operated at room temperature and in air , which is a great advantage for biological applications , because specimens will not be destroyed by the scanning process . in recent years",
    ", considerable efforts have been made to use nv@xmath0 center diamonds for ultra - sensitive nanoscale magnetic sensor heads@xcite and sensor arrays@xcite .",
    "these sensors take advantage of the long - lived spin state of single nv centers to detect small magnetic fields @xcite .",

    "it should be emphasized that magnetic sensors rely on an nv center having an extra electron ( nv@xmath0 ) . the neutralized form , nv@xmath1 , is not useful as a magnetic field sensor .    to detect a magnetic field in a sample ,",
    "either the sample is moved over the nv@xmath0 center embedded in the bulk diamond , or an nv@xmath0 embedded cantilever tip scans over the sample , depending on whether the nv@xmath0 center is implanted at a shallow depth in the substrate or the nv@xmath0 center is located close to the apex of a tip . in both cases , it is very important to maintain a sufficiently strong dipole - dipole coupling between the nv@xmath0 center and the target spin for detection .",
    "the distance between the nv@xmath0 center and the sample surface must be @xmath3 or less , and ideally less than @xmath4 @xmath5 . however , shallow nv@xmath0 centers ( @xmath6 @xmath5 ) tend to become neutralized to nv@xmath1 , rendering magnetic field detection impossible@xcite .",
    "the hydrogen surface termination commonly used for semiconductor processing bends the band diagram and creates a two dimensional hole gas ( @xmath2-dhg ) near the surface , which accelerates the neutralization of nv@xmath0 centers@xcite .",
    "other terminations , such as oxygen and fluorine , do not have the energy band bending problem . however , oxygen termination has its own problem . how oxygen bonds with carbon affects the band diagram drastically . if a c - oh bond is formed , the surface interface has the same problem with the hydrogen termination case causing the band bending and accelerating the neutralization of nv@xmath0 centers . on the other hand ,",
    "fluorine termination is reported to encounter severe blinking or bleaching@xcite .",
    "the detailed analyses about different surface terminations and the bond structures are discussed by kaviani et al.@xcite .",
    "in addition , nv centers interacting with paramagnetic contaminants such as water molecules on the surface can decrease the sensitivity of a magnetometer@xcite .",

    "we have calculated the neutralization ratio , nv@xmath108nv@xmath109 at various depths .",
    "we find that the the nv@xmath0 center neutralization is primarily electrostatic . for high initial concentrations of nv centers",
    ", we have found that nv@xmath0 can remain stable even at depths of less than @xmath3 .    as the concentration increases , the neutralization decreases .",
    "the nv@xmath1  distribution as a function of depth shows that neutralization starts at sites near the surface as expected . increasing concentration decreases the neutralization ratio",
    "this is simply caused by the increase in the shear number of available nv@xmath0s as the concentration increases .",
    "however , when the depth dependence is examined with various but close concentrations , our results suggest that small changes in the initial concentration could lead to large changes in the nv@xmath0 neutralization",
    ". the results are useful to control the stability of nv@xmath0 at shallow depths .",
    "the addition of nitrogen to the system shows that energetically , at a given depth , nitrogen ionization is favored over nv@xmath0 neutralization due to the nitrogen ionization energy being lower than the nv@xmath0  neutralization energy .",
    "finally , we have shown that small variations in the ph of the water layer will lead to insignificant changes in the @xmath2-dhg region within the diamond .",
    "such small changes mean that small variations in the ph of a water layer around ph @xmath89 for a hydrogen terminated diamond will not affect the neutralization of nv@xmath0 centers within the diamond .    this work is supported by nsf dmr-1505641 .",

    "<S> the performance of nitrogen vacancy ( nv@xmath0 ) based magnetic sensors strongly depends on the stability of nitrogen vacancy centers near the diamond surface . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of magnetic field detection is diminished as the nv@xmath0 turns into the neutralized charge state nv@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the neutralization of nv@xmath0 and calculate the ratio of nv@xmath1 to total nv ( nv@xmath0+nv@xmath1 ) caused by a hydrogen terminated diamond with a surface water layer . </S>",
    "<S> we find that nv@xmath0 neutralization exhibits two distinct regions : near the surface , where the nv@xmath0 is completely neutralized , and in the bulk , where the  neutralization ratio is inversely proportional to depth following the electrostatic force law . in addition , small changes in concentration can lead to large differences in neutralization behavior . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon allows one to carefully control the concentration to decrease the nv@xmath0 neutralization . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of nitrogen dopant greatly reduces nv@xmath0 neutralization as the nitrogen ionizes in preference to nv@xmath0 neutralization at the same depth . </S>",
    "<S> the water layer ph also affects neutralization . </S>",
    "<S> if the ph is very low due to cleaning agent residue , then we see a change in the band bending and the reduction of the @xmath2-dimensional hole gas ( dhg ) region . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find that dissolved carbon dioxide resulting from direct contact with the atmosphere at room temperature hardly affects the nv@xmath0 neutralization . </S>"
