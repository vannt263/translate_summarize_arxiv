    "sfs are commonly described in terms of three principal contributions : the aslamazov - larkin ( al ) process , corresponding to the opening of a new channel for the charge transfer  @xcite , anomalous maki - thompson ( mt ) process , which describes single - particle quantum interference at impurities in the presence of sfs@xcite , and the change of the single - particle density of states ( dos ) due to their involvement in fluctuation pairings  ilvy93,bdklv93 . the first two processes ( al and mt ) result in the appearance of positive and singular contributions to conductivity ( diagrams 1 and 2 in fig .",

    "<S> we revise the long studied problem of fluctuation conductivity ( fc ) in disordered two - dimensional superconductors placed in a perpendicular magnetic field by finally deriving the complete solution in the temperature - magnetic field phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained expressions allow both to perform straightforward ( numerical ) calculation of the fc surface @xmath0 and to get asymptotic expressions in all its qualitatively different domains . </S>",
    "<S> this surface becomes in particular non - trivial at low temperatures , where it is trough - shaped with @xmath1 . in this region , close to the quantum phase transition , @xmath2 is non - monotonic , in agreement with experimental findings . </S>",
    "<S> we reanalyzed and present comparisons to several experimental measurements . </S>",
    "<S> based on our results we derive a qualitative picture of superconducting fluctuations close to @xmath3 and @xmath4 where fluctuation cooper pairs rotate with cyclotron frequency @xmath5 and larmor radius @xmath6 , forming some kind of quantum liquid with long coherence length @xmath7 and slow relaxation ( @xmath8 ) . </S>"
