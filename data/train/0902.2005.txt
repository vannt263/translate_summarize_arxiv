    "observational studies have shown that expanding hii  regions and interstellar bubbles are surrounded by massive and dense slowly expanding shells .",
    "stellar formation may be favoured within these dense envelopes around hii  regions ( deharveng , zavagno & caplan 2005 ) and stellar wind bubbles through the _ collect and collapse _",
    "mechanism first described by elmegreen & lada ( 1977 ) , which was analytically developed by whitworth et al .",
    "numerical simulations were performed by dale , bonnell & whitworth ( 2007 ) . in hii  regions , this process can be summarized as follows : the supersonic expansion of an hii  region on their surroundings creates compressed layers where gas and dust are piled up between the ionization and the shock fronts .",
    "this shocked material grows in mass and may become gravitationally unstable . under these conditions , the dense envelopes may break up forming massive cores which could become in nurseries for new generations of massive stars .",
    "thus , the dynamical evolution of hii  regions provides the conditions for the star formation process to develop ( deharveng et al .",
    "2003 , zavagno et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "a similar process may act in the dense envelopes around interstellar bubbles .",
    "indeed , young stellar object ( yso ) candidates have been found projected onto the neutral shells associated with some wind bubbles ( e.g. cappa et al .",
    "2005 ) .    in a previous paper , we studied the ism in the environs of sh2 - 205 , located at a distance of @xmath0 1.0 kpc ( romero & cappa  2008 , hereinafter referred to as paper i ) . in that work",

    "we determined that sh148.830.67 is an interstellar bubble powered by the stellar winds of hd24431 .",
    "the origin of sh149.250.00 , which can hardly be distinguished by its optical and faint radio emissions , remains an open question since no stellar object was found associated with the nebula .",
    "the shell centered at , of @xmath1 22 @xmath2 15 in size , is placed at a kinematical distance of 1.5 kpc and may be related to the open cluster ngc1444 .",
    "the most striking area is lbn148.110.45 .",
    "this is a classical hii  region of 30@xmath2 24  in size and in age .",
    "neutral atomic and molecular gas in the velocity range  partially encircles this ionized region .",
    "it is also closely surrounded by a dust ring detected in the mid- and far - infrared , suggesting the presence of a pdr ( photodissociation region ) at the interface between the ionized and molecular regions . the derived ambient density ( n@xmath3 @xmath1 800 @xmath4 )",
    "indicates that this hii  region is evolving in a dense interstellar medium ( paper i ) .",
    "the morphology of this hii  region encouraged us to look for signposts of stellar formation activity at its periphery . in this paper",
    "we investigate the stellar formation activity in the three different structures of sh2 - 205 and in the large hi  shell , based on infrared point source catalogues .",

    "4 . a summary of the main results is presented in sect .",
    "in order to find primary indicators of stellar formation activity in the region under study , we used the msx6c infrared point source catalogue ( egan et al .",

    "in addition , broadband mid- and far - infrared data supplied by the msx and iras satellites were employed to show the large scale distribution of the dust .",
    "star formation activity was investigated within a box centered at of 25  in side .",
    "@xmath9co(10 ) data from dame , hartmann & thaddeus  ( 2001 ) were also used to compare the spatial distribution of the tracers of stellar formation activity with that of the molecular gas .",
    "these data have an angular resolution of 8.3 arcmin , a velocity resolution of 1.3 , and an rms noise of 0.05 k.    the criteria used to identify yso candidates are described in the following paragraphs .      a total of 89 iras point sources were found projected onto the analyzed region .",
