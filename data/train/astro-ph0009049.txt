    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are close binary systems in which mass is transferred from a red dwarf star that fills its roche lobe onto a white dwarf ( wd ) . intermediate polars ( or dq her systems )",
    "are a subclass of magnetic cataclysmic variables with an asynchronously rotating ( @xmath2 ) magnetic white dwarf ( patterson , @xcite ; warner , @xcite ) .",
    "the accretion flow from the red dwarf star forms an accretion disk around white dwarf , and this disk is disrupted by the magnetic field close to the white dwarf . within the magnetospheric radius",
    ", the material is channeled towards the magnetic polar regions in an arc - shaped accretion ( rosen,@xcite )    the recently discovered pulsating x - ray source ( israel et al . , @xcite )",
    "was announced as a new intermediated polar ( ip ) by negueruela et al . , ( @xcite ) from spectral observations .",
    "strong modulations of this source in x - rays were obtained from rosat pspc ( @xmath3 sec ) and more accurate @xmath4 sec from asca are presented by israel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and israel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "photometric observations of the optical counterpart of exhibited strong optical variations , compatible with the x - rays ( @xmath5 min ) period ( uslenghi et al . , @xcite ) .",
    "this modulation was interpreted as evidence of a spin period of the wd in this close binary system .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of new photometric and spectral observations of this system .",
    "the ccd photometric and spectral observations of the were carried out on 25 august 2000 at the 1.5 m and 2.12 m telescopes of the observatorio astronomico nacional , san pedro martir of the institute of astronomy of unam , mexico .",
    "the log of observations is presented in table.[logobs ] .",
    ".observations log [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     ( 175,80)(0,3 ) ( 0,11 )    doppler tomography is a useful tool to extract further information on cvs from trailed spectra .",
    "this method , which was developed by marsh & horne , ( @xcite ) , uses the velocity profiles of emission - lines at each phase to create a two - dimensional intensity image in velocity - space coordinates ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "therefore , the doppler tomogram can be interpreted as a projection of emitting regions in cataclysmic variables onto the plane perpendicular to the observers view .",
    "we used the code developed by spruit ( @xcite ) to constrain doppler maps of with maximum entropy method .",
    "the resulting doppler maps ( or tomogram ) of emission lines of , and the blend of / are displayed as a gray - scale image in fig.[doppler ] and fig.[doppler1 ] .",
    "also in fig.[doppler ] are displayed trailed spectra of and in phase space and their corresponding reconstructed counterparts .",
    "two features in the maps are distinct : an accretion disk seen as a dark circle extending to up to @xmath7km / sec on h@xmath8 doppler tomogram and a bright spots detected in all three maps to the left and below the center of mass at velocities @xmath9 , @xmath10 in 4686 . apart from the spot a cometary tail linked to it and extending to @xmath11 can be clearly seen on the map . these we identify with the mass transfer stream and its shape was essential for our selection of the ballistic trajectory .",
    "a helpful assistance in interpreting doppler maps are additional inserted plots which mark the position of the secondary star and the ballistic trajectory of the gas stream .",
    "here we used our estimates of p@xmath12 and m@xmath13 with various combination of @xmath14 and @xmath15 from fig.[angle ] in order to obtain the `` best fit '' ( by simple eye inspection ) of calculated stream trajectory with the gray scale image .",
    "our preferred solution of inclination is @xmath16 .",
    "it is marked on fig.[angle ] and is given in table.[param ] .",
    "of course other close solutions are applicable . comparing the location of spots in doppler maps of and we can distinguish actually two hot spots on the disk ( fig.[doppler ] ) . the elongated spot coinciding in both emission lines",
    "is caused probably by the mass transfer stream and the shock of impact with the disk , while the compact dense spot toward negative v@xmath17 s , much better seen in than in the two other lines , is a result of heating of the disk by x - ray beam .",
    "the / pattern mostly repeats that of with less intensity of course ( fig.[doppler1 ] ) .",
    "the results to be a classical `` textbook '' intermediate polar .",
    "it has an orbital period p@xmath18 above the period gap , as the vast majority of ips .",
    "it exhibits x - ray and optical coherent pulsations of the order of @xmath19p@xmath12 , undoubtfully originating from asynchronous spin of magnetic wd in a close binary system .",
    "also the beat period in optical light is detectable .",
    "this is another characteristic of intermediate polars .",
    "other orbital parameters derived from assumption that the system obeys the p@xmath12@xmath20m@xmath13 relation for cvs are also in - line with accumulated data on other ips and theoretical aspects ( warner , @xcite , paterson , @xcite , see also url ) .    the radial velocity curves , the light curve and the doppler tomography confirm the presence of an accretion ring around the wd and the existence of hot spots caused by heating of parts of the disk by the x - ray beam and from interaction with the mass transfer stream ."
