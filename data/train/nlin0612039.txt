    "the ratchet effect , i.e. , a directional motion of a particle using unbiased fluctuations , has attracted much attention in recent years @xcite . an early motivation in this field is to explain an underlying mechanism of molecular motors which transport molecules in the absence of appropriate potential and thermal gradients @xcite . lately",

    "the anticipated synchronization was observed in delay coupled inertia ratchet systems @xcite and the stabilization of chaotic current to low - period orbits was presented , using time - delayed feedback methods , in the deterministic inertia ratchet system @xcite .    starting with the work of ott , grebogi , and yorke @xcite , various methods for controlling chaotic dynamics",
    "have been developed @xcite .",
    "particularly , pyragas proposed a simple and efficient method , which utilizes a control signal with a difference between the present state of the system and the previous state delayed by the period of an unstable periodic orbit ( upo ) @xcite .",
    "this method is noninvasive in the sense that the control signal vanishes when the targeted upo embedded in a chaotic attractor is stabilized .",
