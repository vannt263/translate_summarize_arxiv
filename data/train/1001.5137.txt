    "structural transitions constitute an evolving field of research comprising of unique and interesting mechanisms like creep and rupture @xcite , plastic deformation @xcite , externally induced crystal structure transformations @xcite , the shape memory effect and pseudoelasticity @xcite and so on . the revolution in material research , especially in nanoscale functional materials , ferromagnetic shape memory alloys etc .",
    ", have added , both in complexity and diversity , to these transitions , particularly in the nature of their response to external stimuli such as mechanical stress , temperature , current or magnetic field .",
    "a commonness in structural transitions in diverse materials lies in the fact that the quenched disorder at the micro scale often manifests in discontinuities , avalanches or bursts and step changes in many of the physical responses . a description of the response within the framework of continuum models , used for instance , to describe the viscous flow at the onset of plasticity , breaks down , thereby demanding newer approaches to study these systems @xcite .",
    "the crystallographic constraints and long range interactions lead to collective motions and avalanche - like behavior that have been the major focus of many recent works , indicating a universality in the statistical mechanics of these processes @xcite .",
    "they form a subset of a larger class of systems exhibiting non - equilibrium dynamics @xcite .",
    "these systems are found to posses a complex free energy landscape , where metastable states are separated by large potential energy barriers .",
    "avalanches play a major role in driven non equilibrium systems manifesting in various forms like barkhausen noise in magnetic hysteresis@xcite , acoustic emission under mechanical stress@xcite and so on .",
    "it has been observed that for such  crackling \" noise , avalanches lead to fluctuations of physical properties that often become scale invariant or self similar .",
    "however , the statistics of these fluctuating dynamic quantities have largely been confined to the study of universality in the underlying physical processes , for example , in self organization of disorder@xcite , but hardly exploited as a characterizing tool for material dependent transition properties themselves . here",
    ", we aim to use higher order statistics of fluctuations as a sensor to structural transitions and the microstructural modifications in a typical driven - nonequilibrium system , namely , the martensite transformation .",
    "martensite transformation has been known to be a prototype of out - of - equilibrium phenomena@xcite and at the same time constitutes the basis of a large variety of practical applications including actuators , micro - pumps and so on in material systems , that display shape memory effect and pseudoelasticity @xcite .",
    "these transitions are known to be athermal , as large elastic energy barriers that separate the metastable states require a driving force in the form of time varying stress or temperature for the transition to proceed , and can not be driven by thermal fluctuations alone @xcite .",
    "interplay of disorder and long range elastic forces is known to play a significant role in the transformation kinetics and it is this feature that we aim to exploit in the present study .",
    "the kinetics of martensitic transformation has been previously studied using acoustic emission measurements which probe the size distribution and duration of avalanches and their universal features @xcite .",
    "however , the transformation temperature scales and the microstructural evolution which are also essential for many device applications are addressed only in limited number of cases  @xcite . generally , one resorts to the conventional methods of calorimetry or standard resistivity measurements for the determination of these parameters @xcite .",
    "apart from inherent inaccuracies and subjectivities involved , many of these techniques fail as one scales down the size and amount of materials @xcite , becoming mostly inapplicable in the nanoscale systems . on the other hand , electrical noise , or fluctuations in resistivity ,",
    "has also shown distinct and interesting results in martensite transformation and avalanche dynamics  @xcite , and could be a potential tool to characterize the transition . indeed , it was recently shown that higher order avalanche statistics is an excellent probe to martensite transformation , where detection of structural change depends on in - built long range correlation , rather than the amount of energy released @xcite . however , sensitivity of such a technique to small scale microstructural change is still not known .",
    "the present study is hence relevant in three ways .",
    "first , it provides a kinetic detector which could detect both magnitude and changes in the transformation temperatures as the material undergoes any slight modification in its structural morphology .",
    "although resistivity measurements have been used for over three decades @xcite as a tool next to the calorimetric measurements , we show here that the phase transformation start and finish temperatures assigned based on the resistivity curves often lead to difficulties .",
    "we aim to establish that the fluctuation in resistance and its higher order statistics could reveal more detailed and accurate information about the transformation parameters as compared to conventional resistivity measurements .",
    "second , though the athermal dynamics and the avalanche statistics have been well established in the context of crackling behavior@xcite , a clear link between this statistical approach and the microstructural details of these materials is lacking .",
    "statistics of fluctuations @xcite could again be used to probe this missing link , by altering the microstructure of the sample through thermal cycling as well as by varying the drive rate .",
    "this is crucial to many applications of shape memory alloys since a minute change in the temperature scales on repeated use could result in major consequences in their applications .",
    "third , even though the martensitic transformation is expected to be associated with a long - range elastic interaction , a direct probe to the nature and effect of this interaction is still absent . here",
    ", we address this issue with higher - order fluctuation statistics as the experimental tool . a connection between the statistical parameters and the material specific microstructural details that our results indicate might also be applicable to many forms of structural transition from a common platform .",
    "in addition , although the various timescales have been applied to explain the overlap of avalanches during the phase transformation , a clear link between these timescales and the material properties is not well established .",
    "we propose a simplistic model which accounts for the variation of the different transition parameters with increase in drive rate .",
    "sections ii and iii of the paper summarize the material and the experimental methods respectively .",
    "in section iv , we present the major results and in section v , we present a brief discussion and conclude .",
    "the sample used was a nickel - titanium ( niti ) wire of rectangular cross - section @xmath0 procured from m / s fortwayne metals inc .",
    "which was straight annealed and quenched in a strand furnace .",
    "the wire was found to show a two stage phase transformation from austenite ( cubic b2 ) to r - phase ( rhombohedral ) and r - phase to martensite ( b19/b19 monoclinic ) phase on cooling and vice versa on heating @xcite .",
    "the wire was swept through a temperature range of 360  k-120  k for over 50 times , so that defect levels reached a stable configuration .",
    "resistivity fluctuations or noise measurements were carried out at appropriate thermal cycles so that a correspondence could be drawn with the changes in microstructure .",
    "the drive rate dependence was studied only after 75 thermal cycles so that the effects of cycling and driving induced changes in the sample morphology could be decoupled .",
    "resistivity measurements were carried out on the wire samples using a four probe geometry .",
    "a typical resistivity curve is as shown in fig.1 ( a ) .",
    "the resistivity exhibits a hysteresis on cooling and heating indicative of the shape memory effect .",
    "the transformation temperatures can be extracted using conventional formulation @xcite as is shown .",
    "the wire exhibits a two stage phase transformation with an intermediate r - phase .",
    "the subscripts @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the start and finish temperature scales of the different phases .",
    "the sample was current biased using a low noise source and the voltage fluctuations were measured over an interval of time .",
    "we have used a five probe geometry and a dynamically balanced wheatstone s bridge arrangement ( fig.2 ) to measure the noise as proposed by scofield @xcite .    _ * power spectral density ( psd ) * _    the power spectrum @xmath3 quantifies the noise in the frequency domain . if @xmath4 is the fluctuating resistivity , the power spectrum is defined as ,    @xmath5    large classes of fluctuations in condensed matter systems show a power spectrum that has 1/f@xmath6 dependence , with @xmath7 and hence called @xmath8 noise .    in a typical experiment ,",
    "the voltage fluctuations are acquired at a sampling rate of 1000  hz . the data is subsequently decimated using a three stage decimation algorithm with appropriate anti - aliasing at each stage , which removes the unwanted signals .",
    "care has been taken to remove the extraneous noise in the system , using appropriate grounding and shielding using a faraday cage .",
    "an in depth review of the experimental setup and the measurement scheme including the basic digital signal processing steps could be found in our earlier paper @xcite .",
    "_ * second spectrum and the non - gaussian component * _    along with the power spectral density , we have also evaluated the higher order statistics of fluctuations in the form of second spectrum .",
    "the second spectrum is a fourth order moment of the fluctuations , that detects the weak correlations in the noise generating mechanism .",
    "we have used the approach followed by seidler and solin @xcite , which is in turn a modification of the approach followed by restle et al . @xcite .",
    "the resistivity fluctuations over a period of time , @xmath9(t ) , are recorded and then digitally bandpass filtered over a frequency band ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) .",
    "it is then squared point by point and the power spectrum of the time dependent variance of the noise signal is computed which is called the second spectrum , expressed analytically as @xmath12    the second spectrum was computed for each of these data sets , over a frequency band of @xmath13hz and @xmath14hz , and was normalized with the square of the corresponding power spectrum , @xmath15 , as    @xmath16 ^ 2\\ ] ]    the gaussian background has been calculated using the expression evaluated in ref.22 :    @xmath17 ^ 2}\\ ] ]    even weak correlations in the stochastic process contributes a non - gaussian component ( ngc ) to the fluctuations , which can be readily identified from the deviation from its expected gaussian background . in some cases ,",
    "the ngc exhibits frequency dependence , as is clearly shown in ref.18 .",
    "finite detection bandwidth sets the limit of sensitivity of @xmath18 to non - gaussian fluctuations .",
    "for comparison we calculated the total fourth order noise as , @xmath19    within a detection bandwidth of @xmath13  hz and @xmath14  hz , assuming @xmath20 , the value of @xmath21 for a gaussian background should be around 0.93 in accordance with equation(4 ) .",
    "in our case , we see that when correlations are not significant , we obtain a value close to 0.93 as the noise is approximately 1/f in nature over most of the temperature region .",
    "any deviation from this gaussian background can be considered to be the ngc , which is the signature of long - range correlations in the system .",
    "we first probed the signature of avalanches in the resistivity fluctuations across the transformation zone ( using temperature or stress in the case of martensite transformation ) .",
    "since the martensite transformation in niti is primarily athermal , the avalanches are induced only by a continuous sweeping of @xmath22 .",
    "the characteristics of transformation , and hence the statistics of fluctuations , depend crucially on the sweep rate @xmath23 , and will be discussed in detail later .",
    "3(a ) shows the time - dependence of resistivity around @xmath24  k for a niti - device cooled at @xmath25  k / min .",
    "it is clear that the fluctuations are much smaller in the static condition , _",
    "i.e. _ keeping @xmath22 constant at the same value , when avalanches are expected to be absent .    in a typical experiment ,",
    "the fluctuations in @xmath26 were measured with @xmath22 being swept from @xmath27  k to @xmath28  k ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the austenite finish and martensite finish temperature scales respectively ) , with the t - range divided in equal time windows of 8.74 minutes .",
    "both psd and higher order statistics of noise were subsequently calculated in each window and plotted against the temperature corresponding to its midpoint .",
    "the psd of the fluctuations varied as @xmath31 over the experimental bandwidth , where @xmath32 ( see fig .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath33 was found to be slightly smaller than that in niti thin films observed earlier , which could be due to greater inhomogeneity in the bulk niti system in the present case .",
    "the psd magnitude was found to be @xmath22-dependent as well , increasing monotonically with @xmath22 in all devices over the observed @xmath22 range ( see figs.6(a ) and 8(a ) ) .",
    "the behavior of the second spectrum was found to be different .",
    "typically , @xmath34 agrees with the gaussian background ( the dashed line in fig .",
    "3c ) , except at certain values of @xmath22 where it was found to be orders of magnitude higher , indicating significant non - gaussian contribution to noise .",
    "3c illustrates this for a few representative @xmath22 , where @xmath34 at various temperatures @xmath35 is not only much higher than the gaussian background , but also develops a weak slope @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the absolute magnitude of @xmath34 was however found to be highly sample dependent , without any clear trend , but its variation with @xmath22 was qualitatively similar in all devices , which we shall now focus on .",
    "no non - gaussian component of noise could be detected in the static mode ( not shown ) , implying non - gaussian behavior to arise from correlated avalanches ( not shown ) .",
    "unlike psd , we find the ngc to be non - monotonic in @xmath22 , and manifest as strong peaks in @xmath21 at specific temperatures .",
    "one expects four structural transitions in niti within this range : austenite to r - phase ( r@xmath38a ) and r - phase to martensite ( m@xmath38r ) during cooling , and martensite to r*-phase ( m@xmath39r * ) and r*-phase to austenite ( r*@xmath39a ) during heating . in fig .",
    "4(a ) ( cooling ) and 4(c ) ( heating ) these four transitions are identified by the latent heat release in the differential scanning calorimetry measurements ( fig .",
    "4(b ) and 4(d ) ) .",
    "strikingly , the peaks in @xmath21 appear primarily around these phase transformation zones . similar correlation of non - gaussian electrical noise and first order structural phase change was observed in niti thin film as well  @xcite , outlining an excellent _ kinetic _ detector of structural phase transition .",
    "the ngc in resistivity noise has been attributed to emergence of a long range correlation in many systems with electronic  @xcite , structural  @xcite or magnetic@xcite phase transitions .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath21 is directly associated to a correlation length @xmath40 which , in case of martensitic alloys , characterizes the range of elastic correlation in the system .",
    "as the transition is approached , the avalanches become more frequent , which overlap in space , as well as in time in the case of faster sweeps , leading to strongly hierarchical and cooperative atomic kinetics . the non - gaussian fluctuations in @xmath26",
    "is a result of electron wave function coupling to the size of atomic avalanche , _",
    "i.e. _ the number of atoms undergoing displacive movement .",
    "consequently , @xmath40 may attain a maximum at a critical temperature ( @xmath41 ) where the avalanche overlap is also most probable .",
    "this would occur when maximum amount of parent phase is transformed into the product phase , as confirmed by the agreement of @xmath41 with the peak heat release / absorb temperature scales in dsc measurements .",
    "in the following , we stress on two specific questions : ( 1 ) can ngc provide a convenient scheme to evaluate the transformation temperatures , such as the @xmath30 , @xmath29 etc ? secondly ( 2 ) how do small scale microstructural modifications influence the non - gaussian characteristics ?",
    "the microstructural evolution of the material depends mainly on two processes : thermal cycling , which changes the local disorder level , and also the drive rate , which leads to a significant modification in the internal stress levels and avalanche overlap . to analyze these cases in detail , we shall focus mostly on a specific transformation zone , namely that from r - phase to the martensite phase ( m@xmath38r ) while cooling , which in most devices extend from @xmath42  k@xmath43  k.     behavior .",

    ", it often becomes very difficult to assign an unambiguous start and finish temperature to the phase transformation region .",
    "instead , by comparing the range of @xmath22 in dsc data over which the avalanches are observed , to the width of the @xmath21 peak , an alternative scheme can be suggested . as can be seen in the context of martensite transition ( m@xmath38r ) in fig .  5",

    "<S> driven non - equilibrium structural phase transformation has been probed using time varying resistance fluctuations or noise . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the non - gaussian component ( ngc ) of noise obtained by evaluating the higher order statistics of fluctuations , serves as a simple kinetic detector of these phase transitions . using the martensite transformation in free - standing wires of nickel - titanium binary alloys as a prototype , we observe clear deviations from the gaussian background in the transformation zone , indicative of the long range correlations in the system as the phase transforms . </S>",
    "<S> the viability of non - gaussian statistics as a robust probe to structural phase transition was also confirmed by comparing the results from differential scanning calorimetry measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we further studied the response of the ngc to the modifications in the microstructure on repeated thermal cycling , as well as the variations in the temperature drive rate , and explained the results using established simplistic models based on the different competing time scales . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments ( i ) suggest an alternative method to estimate the transformation temperature scales with high accuracy , and ( ii ) establish a connection between the material - specific evolution of microstructure to the statistics of its linear response . </S>",
    "<S> since the method depends on an in - built long - range correlation during transformation , it could be portable to other structural transitions , as well as to materials of different physical origin and size . </S>"
