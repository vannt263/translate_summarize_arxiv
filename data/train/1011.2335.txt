    "in time - independent domains the skorohod problem , in the form studied in this article , goes back to tanaka @xcite , who established existence and uniqueness of solutions to the skorohod problem in convex domains with normal reflection .",
    "these results were subsequently generalized to wider classes of time - independent domains by , in particular , lions and sznitman @xcite and saisho @xcite . by imposing an admissibility condition on the domain , lions and sznitman @xcite proved existence and uniqueness of solutions to the skorohod problem in two different cases .",
    "the first of the two cases considered normal reflection on domains satisfying a uniform exterior sphere condition , meaning that the domain is smooth except for `` convex corners . ''",
    "moreover , the second case considered smoothly varying ( possibly oblique ) directions of reflection on smooth domains . in addition , for smoothly varying directions of reflection on domains satisfying a uniform exterior sphere condition , existence and uniqueness results were obtained in the special case when the oblique reflection cone can be transformed into the normal cone by multiplication by a smooth matrix function .",
    "saisho saisho1987 later showed that in the first case considered in @xcite , that is , for normal reflection , the admissibility condition is not necessary and can be removed .",
    "moreover , concerning oblique reflection , that is , when the cone of reflection differs from the cone of inward normals , we note that in the case of an orthant with constant directions of reflection on the sides , harrison and reiman @xcite found sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the skorohod problem as well as for continuity of the reflection map . in this context",
    "we also mention that bernard and el kharroubi @xcite provided necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions to the skorohod problem in an orthant with constant directions of reflection on each face .",
    "the most general results so far concerning the existence of solutions to the skorohod problem with oblique reflection in time - independent domains were derived by costantini @xcite .",
    "costantini @xcite proved existence of solutions to the skorohod problem for domains satisfying a uniform exterior sphere condition with a nontangential reflection cone given as a continuous transformation of the normal cone .",
    "note that this allowed for discontinuous directions of reflection at the corners .",
    "the question of uniqueness of solutions to the skorohod problem with oblique reflection is , in general , still an open question and has been settled only in some specific cases . for example ,",
    "dupuis and ishii @xcite obtained uniqueness for a convex polyhedron with constant directions of reflection on the faces assuming the existence of a certain convex set , defined in terms of the normal directions and the directions of reflection .",
    "dupuis and ishii @xcite later extended this result to piecewise smooth domains with smoothly varying directions of reflection on each face .",
    "in addition , we here also mention the work of dupuis and ramanan @xcite based on convex duality techniques .",
    "in particular , in @xcite convex duality is used to transform the condition of dupuis and ishii @xcite into one that is much easier to verify . before we proceed , we here note that the outline above is an attempt to briefly discuss relevant previous developments concerning the skorohod problem in the form studied in this article . in particular , the study of reflected diffusion based on skorohod problems was first introduced by skorohod @xcite and this approach has , as briefly described , subsequently been developed in many articles , including @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , we emphasize that the literature devoted to skorohod problems , their extensions and applications is much larger than what is conveyed above and , in fact , many more researcher have contributed to this rich field . in particular , applied areas where skorohod problems occur include heavy traffic analysis of queueing networks ( see , e.g , @xcite ) , control theory , game theory and mathematical economics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , image processing ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and molecular dynamics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for further results concerning skorohod problems , as well as applications of skorohod problems , we also refer to @xcite and @xcite",
    ".    an important novelty of this article is that we conduct a thorough study of the skorohod problem , and the subsequent applications to stochastic differential equations reflected at the boundary , in the setting of time - dependent domains . to our knowledge",
    ", the skorohod problem is indeed less developed in time - dependent domains . in particular , a first treatment of the skorohod problem in time - dependent domains was given by costantini , gobet and el karoui @xcite , who proved existence and uniqueness of solutions to the skorohod problem with normal reflection in smooth time - dependent domains .",
    "moreover , existence and uniqueness for deterministic problems of skorohod type in time - dependent intervals have recently also been established by burdzy , chen and sylvester @xcite , burdzy , kang and ramanan @xcite .",
    "the main contribution of this article is that we are able to generalize the results in @xcite , concerning cdlg solutions to the skorohod problem with oblique reflection , to time - dependent domains assuming less regularity on the domains compared to @xcite .",
    "note also that in @xcite we use the results of this article to construct a numerical method for weak approximation of stochastic differential equations with oblique reflection in time - dependent domains .",
    "finally , as in @xcite , we note , in particular , that reflecting brownian motions in time - dependent domains arise in queueing theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , statistical physics , ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , control theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and finance ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , in future articles we hope to be able to further explore the results and techniques developed in this article in several applications .    to properly formulate the multidimensional skorohod problem considered in this article , and our results , we in the following first have to introduce some notation . given @xmath5 , we let @xmath6 denote the standard inner product on @xmath7 and we let @xmath8 be the euclidean norm of @xmath9 whenever @xmath10 , we let @xmath11 and @xmath12 . moreover ,",
