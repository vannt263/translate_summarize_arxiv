    "the evolution of a three - dimensional dome connected to a surface shock wave is observed for the 17 january 2010 cme  flare event .",
    "it was studied in detail by @xcite who showed that the surface as well as the off - limb structure are part of an evolving three - dimensional wave - dome formed by a weak shock . the surface wave propagated with a mean speed of @xmath4280  km  s@xmath1 whereas the upward moving part was of much higher speed of @xmath4650  km  s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the difference between the speed of the upward - moving part of the wave and the on - disk signature was interpreted by @xcite in the following manner : the upward - moving part is driven all of the time by the outward moving cme , whereas the surface signature is only temporarily driven by the flanks of the expanding cme and then propagates freely .",
    "a recent article by @xcite , studying the same event , supports the result that the dome - structure was actually a shock - driven plasma flow .",
    "@xcite simulated the evolution of the shock wave from which they concluded that most likely an abrupt eruption of a filament caused the weak shock .",
    "they compare this with a blast - wave scenario during which the wave is only briefly driven .",
    "@xcite investigated , for the 17 january 2010 event the relation between the surface wave speed , the cme speed and the local fast - mode characteristic speed .",
    "they concluded that the observed cme front is in fact a wave phenomenon just like the euv wave on the solar surface .    in this study , we focus on the kinematical evolution of the off - disk signature of the dome - shaped wave event and add new aspects not covered by previous studies .",
    "using observations of the secchi instruments euvi and cor1 on stereo we will show , by applying an analytical model with input parameters constrained by the observations , that the off - disk signature in fact consists of two components : a driver and a weakly shocked wave .",
    "the driver of the off - limb wave evolves from expanding loop structures and is interpreted as the cme , the observed frontal part is interpreted as the shock wave ahead . in particular , we investigate the shock offset ( standoff ) distance for the wave - driver system .",

    "the upward moving dome is well observed in white - light coronagraph stereo - b / cor1 and cor2 data . in the following study we use euvi 171  and 195  filtergrams with a temporal cadence of 60 and 90  seconds , respectively , as well as cor1 white - light data with a cadence of five minutes . using these instruments we can follow the event in euvi out to 1.7  _ _ r@xmath3 _ _ and in cor1 over the field - of - view of 1.4 to 4  _ _ r@xmath3__. accordingly , we focus on the low coronal signatures of the flare / cme event and its early evolution phase .",
    "we note that associated with the event is a high - frequency type ii burst drifting from @xmath4310 mhz to @xmath480 mhz during @xmath403:5103:58  ut .",
    "the source region of the event under study is active region ar  11041 located at s25e128 , _ i.e. _  occulted as viewed from earth .    in order to derive the kinematical evolution of the off - disk wave , we follow the dome - shaped structure . for this",

    "under the assumption that the coronal wave under study is a large - amplitude mhd wave , we show that the observed dome belongs to a wave  driver system .",
    "we simulate the observed kinematical profile of the dome structure by using the analytical model developed by @xcite which we briefly describe in the following .    in the model ,",
    "the driver of the wave is a `` synthetic '' source surface which continuously emits mhd signals at time steps of @xmath10 = ten seconds .",

    "the geometry of the driver is spherically symmetric and radially expanding with a radius @xmath18 centered at height @xmath19 .",
    "the beginning of the shock formation in the model is determined when a later emitted signal overtakes the outermost one ( for more details see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for the driver of the off - disk wave",
    "we consider a source that may expand and move at the same time with a constant radius - to - height ratio [ @xmath20 acting as a combined bow - shock / piston driver .",
    "we refer to a bow - shock for a shock wave that moves with the same speed as the driver and material can flow behind the driver , whereas the piston - driven shock continuously compresses the wave ahead leading to an increase in the shock standoff distance and increase in speed of wave ( for more details on the terminology see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for completeness",
    "we also simulate the on - disk surface wave for which we use a synthetic source expanding only in the lateral direction without upward motion , _",
    "i.e. _  plasma can not flow behind the contact surface and the driver acts as a piston @xcite . for the one - dimensional case , @xcite developed a simplified relation between the propagation speed of the surrounding plasma and the amplitude of the wave . from this",
    "it follows that the rest - frame speed of the wave signals [ @xmath21 is related to the flow velocity [ @xmath22 which is associated with the perturbation amplitude , and the local alfvn velocity [ @xmath23 as @xmath24 . since we do not know the spatial distribution of @xmath25 in the corona we simply express the change of @xmath25 with distance using an exponential function ( see equation ( 2 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "in this way , the exponential function regulates the decay of the wave signals . for more details on the model",

    "coronal waves are assumed to be driven impulsively over a short time and then to propagate freely ( _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) whereas , due to the upward movement of the cme , a separate mechanism acts on off - disk waves",
    ". therefore , for simulating the on- and off - disk wave we will apply two different expansion mechanisms of the driver , which enables us to derive their physical characteristics separately .",
    "figure  [ model0 ] gives a snapshot of a model run showing the wave signals ( circles ) that were emitted during the expansion of the source .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ model0 ] considers the simulation of the off - disk wave and shows the emitted signals for an upward moving ( along the _ y_-axis ) and simultaneously expanding source .",

    "the dome of the wave can be seamlessly connected to the surface wave which supports the idea that it is part of the on - disk wave and not the frontal part of the erupting structure ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , a secondary intensity enhancement is observed behind the top part of the wave , which can be interpreted as the driver of the wave .",
    "the top part of the wave and the structure behind evolve and expand concurrently since no black / white feature is visible in the running - difference image .",

    "we note that the northern loop structure observed at 03:51:32  ut may look similar to a wave signature but may actually be a loop system pushed down as a consequence of the lateral expansion of the central eruption @xcite . at 03:52:47  ut a circularly shaped signature ,",
    "presenting the coronal wave , appears ( marked with a yellow line ) .",
    "in addition , some internal structure visible as intensity enhancements ( black dashed line ) are observed behind the wave front and ahead of the expanding loops , most probably resulting due to compressed plasma .",
    "the on - disk wave evolves from the northern loop system and the off - disk signature of the wave becomes visible at @xmath40.28  _ r@xmath3 _ above the solar surface ahead of the radially expanding loop structure . from the southern loop system",

    "we note that the surface coronal - wave could be observed with highest intensity in the northward direction @xcite . during the early evolution of the off - disk wave ,",

    "the profiles of time steps 03:56  ut and 03:57",
    "ut reveal that , relative to the driver component , the wave gains in intensity and the distance between them increases .",
    "this can be interpreted as compression of plasma ahead of the driver and steepening of the wave front , which propagates faster than the driver .",
    "the ratio images become very noisy further out than @xmath41.3  _ r@xmath3 _ ( _ cf . _  figure  [ ratio ] ) . by using running difference images",
    "we derive the distance - time profile of the dome wave over the entire fov of euvi - b  195 and 171 and beyond that from cor1 data .",
    "we manually measure the top part of the dome as well as the secondary intensity structure along their propagation of motion .",
    "the derived kinematics of wave / driver of the off - disk wave is shown in figure  [ model ] .",
    "the observational results of the solar - surface wave are taken from the study by @xcite and are calculated as the mean distance of the wave fronts from the derived wave center along great circles on the solar surface .",
    "furthermore , figure  [ model ] presents the simulated kinematics for the off - disk wave and its driver as well as for the on - disk wave , choosing model parameters constrained by observations .",

    "the surrounding alfvn speed of the unperturbed plasma is chosen as @xmath29=500  km  s@xmath1 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this type of source expansion acts as a combined bow - shock / piston driver for the emitted signals .",
    "the decay of the signal follows an exponential function and is set , according to the best match between observational and model results , with a decay length of 220  mm .",
    "the distance of the front of the wave minus the top part of the source is defined as the standoff distance .",
    "the timing of shock formation is about 03:51:42  ut , which is close to the occurrence of the type ii burst , after that the wave is freely propagating .    in order to mimic the surface signal ( euv wave )",
    "the source of the surface wave expands in a lateral direction and is fixed at the surface which can be interpreted as piston .",
    "the kinematics for this source is a synthetic profile accelerating over a time span of 90  seconds with an acceleration of @xmath6=1.7  km  s@xmath7 giving a final velocity of the driver of @xmath26=153  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the surrounding alfvn speed of the unperturbed plasma is chosen as @xmath29=200  km  s@xmath1 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the decay length of the wave signals of 500  mm is chosen to be consistent with observations given in @xcite , where the intensity profile strongly decreases in the range of 500800  mm .",
    "the timing of shock formation for the solar - surface wave is about 03:50:02  ut after which the wave is freely propagating .",
    "figure  [ standoff1 ] shows the shock standoff distance between the driver and wave component for the dome - shaped structure .",
    "a good match is found between the standoff distance derived by manually tracking the wave - driver system and extracted from intensity profiles .",
    "the observed standoff distance shows a rather linear evolution up to 1  _",
    "r@xmath3_. beyond this distance , cor1-b observations ( last four data points ) indicate a decreasing growth - rate of the standoff distance , _",
    "i.e. _ a certain `` stagnation '' of the growth .",
    "the model results for the off - disk wave , presented by the black solid line in figure  [ standoff1 ] , show a rather sharp increase of the standoff distance at heights below 0.3  _ r@xmath3_. beyond this height , a non - linear regime starts , characterized by a stagnation of the growth - rate , quite similar to that found from cor1-b measurements .",
    "such a behavior can be attributed to the way that the source surface , from which the wave signals are emitted , behaves .",
    "the source moves upward and expands at the same time with @xmath28 , hence the expansion is coupled to the kinematical characteristics of the synthetic source .",
    "the standoff distance therefore reflects the kinematical profile of the synthetic source . the stagnation beyond @xmath41.2  _ r@xmath3 _ results from the assumed decay of the wave , calculated by an exponential function with a decay length of 220  mm .",
    "this can be interpreted such that the initial lateral ( over-)expansion of the cme @xcite acts as a piston close to the sun , which results in an increase in the standoff distance since plasma material can not flow behind the driver @xcite .",
    "as the wave  driver system further evolves it becomes more of a piston / bow - shock type and the increase in distance between driver and wave is less strong .",
    "the standoff distance derived for the on - disk wave , presented as grey line in figure  [ standoff1 ] , shows a steep linear increase over distance .",
    "this reflects the ( 3d ) piston mechanism of the laterally expanding source which impulsively drives the wave and as the strong expansion of the driver stops the wave continuously separates from the driver .",
    "figure  [ standoff2 ] shows an estimation of the shock standoff distance at 1  au for which we simply extend , by using linear fits ( assuming self - similar expansion of the cme ) , the results derived close to the sun up to the earth s location . for the model we use a linear fit to results obtained over the distance range 810__r@xmath3__. we apply a linear fit to all measured data points and , to take into account the stagnation of the growth rate in standoff distance at larger distance , a linear fit to cor1-b observations only ( last four data points ) . from this",
    "we obtain a lower and upper limit for the standoff distance at 1  au lying in the range of @xmath42036  _ r@xmath3_. we note that the standoff distance derived from the model is very close to the linearly extrapolated standoff distance for cor1-b data points .",
    "considering the wave speed of @xmath26=600  km  s@xmath1 , this corresponds to a shock - cme time lag of the order of 611  hours at 1  au .",
    "this is consistent with reports of the thickness of the magnetosheath of icmes measured from in - situ data typically of the order of 0.1  au ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in a recent investigation @xcite find a value of 20  _",
    "r@xmath3 _ for the shock standoff distance at 0.5  au .    the standoff distance [ @xmath30 between driver and wave is related to the speed and the size of the driver ( see , _ e.g. _ , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "physically , it is the mach number [ @xmath31 and the radius of curvature [ @xmath32 of the nose of the driver that controls the standoff distance .",
    "therefore , in figure  [ theory ] our model results for the relative standoff distance [ @xmath33 are presented as a function of @xmath34 using @xmath29=500  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the model results are compared with one measurement of @xmath35 determined at a time when the shock structure could be most clearly observed and the kinematical profile of the cme reached constant speed of @xmath4600  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "@xmath36 is obtained by fitting a circle to the driver of the wave ( see right panel of figure  [ theory ] ) .",
    "we derive for the relative standoff distance of the shock under study a value of @xmath40.4@xmath370.1@xmath36 . considering a lower and upper limit of the alfvn speed ( @xmath38  km  s@xmath1 ) at the measured distance of @xmath41.5  _ r@xmath3 _ above the solar surface @xcite , we obtain @xmath39 .",

    "<S> , the wave signature appears to be dome shaped having a component propagating on the solar surface ( @xmath0  280  km  s@xmath1 ) as well as off - disk ( @xmath0  600  km  s@xmath1 ) away from the sun . </S>",
    "<S> the off - disk dome of the wave consists of two enhancements in intensity , which conjointly develop and can be followed up to white - light coronagraph images . applying an analytic model </S>",
    "<S> , we derive that these intensity variations belong to a wave - driver system with a weakly shocked wave , initially driven by expanding loops , which are indicative of the early evolution phase of the accompanying cme . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the shock standoff distance between wave and driver from observations as well as from model results . </S>",
    "<S> the shock standoff distance close to the sun ( @xmath20.3  _ _ r@xmath3 _ _ above the solar surface ) is found to rapidly increase with values of @xmath40.030.09  _ r@xmath3 _ which give evidence of an initial lateral ( over-)expansion of the cme . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematical evolution of the on - disk wave could be modeled using input parameters which require a more impulsive driver ( @xmath5=90  s , @xmath6=1.7  km  s@xmath7 ) compared to the off - disk component ( @xmath5=340  s , @xmath6=1.5  km  s@xmath7 ) . </S>"
