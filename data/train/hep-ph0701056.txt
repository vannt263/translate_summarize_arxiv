    "the data from @xmath3 exclusive processes play an important role in studies of nucleon resonances with the clas detector @xcite .",
    "single and double pion channels combined account for major part of the total cross - section in the @xmath2 excitation region .",
    "these two channels offer complementary information on @xmath2 s .",
    "the single pion channel is mostly sensitive to resonances with masses less than 1.6 gev , while many high lying states preferably decay with 2@xmath0 emission .",
    "the studies of 2@xmath0 electroproduction with clas for the first time provided the electrocouplings of high lying nucleon states @xcite .",
    "moreover , 1@xmath0 and 2@xmath0 channels are strongly coupled by final state interactions ( fsi ) .",
    "therefore , data on 2@xmath0 electroproduction are critical for @xmath2 studies in the combined analysis of major exclusive channels within the framework of coupled channel approaches .",
    "the most advanced coupled channel analysis , incorporating rigorous treatment of fsi in the 3-body @xmath4 final states was proposed recently @xcite .",
    "for the first time a complete set of unpolarized single - differential cross sections was measured @xcite . phenomenological analysis of these data open up the opportunity to establish the major contributing mechanisms and to determine the evolution of @xmath2 electrocouplings in a wide range of photon virtualities .",
    "we have developed a phenomenological model , that incorporates particular meson - baryon mechanisms based on their manifestations in observables@xmath5 as enhancements in invariant mass distributions , sharp forward / backward slopes in angular distributions .",
    "analysis of earlier clas data @xcite incorporated particular meson - baryon mechanisms needed to describe @xmath6p , @xmath6@xmath7 , @xmath7p invariant masses and @xmath7 angular distribution .",
    "these cross sections were analyzed in the hadronic mass range from 1.41 to 1.89 gev .",
    "the overall @xmath8-coverage ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 @xmath9 . in the 2005 version of this analysis approach ( jm05 ) @xcite double charged pion production was described by the superposition of quasi - two - body channels with the formation and subsequent decay of unstable particles in the intermediate states : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 . remaining direct 2@xmath0 production mechanisms without formation of unstable intermediate particles were described by a set of exchange terms with the amplitudes as outlined in @xcite .",
    "implementation of exchange terms allowed much improved description of the @xmath7 angular distributions @xcite .",
    "the production amplitudes for the first three quasi - two - body intermediate states were treated as sums of @xmath2 excitations in the @xmath16-channel and non - resonant mechanisms described in refs @xcite . all well established 4 star resonances with observed decays to the two pion final states were included as well as the 3-star states @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the production amplitudes for the @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 intermediate state were treated as non - resonant contributions only .",
    "their parametrization is described in @xcite .    in the jm05 approach we succeeded in describing all beforementioned observables in the clas data @xcite .",

    ".    in the analysis of preliminary clas 2@xmath0 data at w@xmath211.6 gev and photon virtualities from 0.2 to 0.6 @xmath9 @xcite for the first time we attempted to fit contributing mechanisms to the full set of unpolarized single - differential cross - sections .",
    "nine single - differential cross - sections combined were fitted within the framework of jm05 approach in each w and @xmath8 bin covered by measurements @xcite .",
    "they consist of all single - differential cross - sections mentioned in previous section and also included @xmath22 and p angular distributions and three distributions over angles @xmath23 between two planes , composed by momenta of the two pairs of the final hadrons for three combinations amongst these pairs . to provide a better description of @xmath22 and p angular distributions",
    ", we modified the dynamics of direct 2@xmath0 production mechanisms with respect to those used in jm05 version .",
    "the mechanisms of @xcite were substituted by ladder - type double exchange processes , shown in fig .",
    "[ diag ]    the amplitude parametrization is presented in @xcite . after these modifications we succeeded to describe clas data @xcite in the entire kinematics covered by the measurements . as a typical example",
    ", description of an entire set of single - differential 2@xmath0 cross - sections within the framework of the jm06 model version is shown in fig .",
    "[ 1diff ] together with the contributions from various mechanisms of jm06 approach .",
    "the shapes of cross - sections for various contributing mechanisms are substantially different in the observables , but highly correlated by mechanism amplitudes .",
    "therefore , a successful description of all unpolarized single - differential cross - sections allowed us to pin down all major contributing processes .",
    "we found no need for remaining mechanisms of unknown dynamics . to check the reliability of the amplitudes for contributing processes , derived in phenomenological data analysis",
    ", we fixed all jm06 parameters , fitting them to six single - differential cross - sections@xmath5 all invariant masses and three final state angular distributions .",
    "the remaining three distributions over @xmath23 s angles were calculated , keeping jm06 parameters fixed .",
    "reasonable description of @xmath23 s angular distributions was achieved in the entire kinematics area covered by measurements .",
    "therefore , we confirmed the reliability of 2@xmath0 electroproduction mechanisms established in phenomenological data analysis within the framework of jm06 model .    in fig .",
    "[ p11d13 ] we show electrocouplings of @xmath24 , @xmath25 states , determined from the analysis of preliminary clas data on 2@xmath0 electroproduction @xcite within the framework of jm06 approach . for the first time we obtained information on @xmath8-evolution of electrocouplings for these states from @xmath26 channel at @xmath8 from 0.2 to 0.6 @xmath9 .",
    "these photon virtualities are particularly sensitive to the contributions from @xmath2 meson - baryon dressing .",
    "moreover , these data are not contaminated by the contribution from @xmath27 tail .",
    "the electrocouplings obtained from this analysis are in reasonable agreement with the results from 1@xmath0 exclusive channel @xcite , as well as from the combined 1@xmath0/2@xmath0 analysis @xcite .",
