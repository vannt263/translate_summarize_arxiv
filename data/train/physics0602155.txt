    "mode conversion from one type of wave mode to another type of mode at resonance points in an inhomogeneous plasma is a very important phenomenon in various branches of plasma physics.@xcite in a previous paper,@xcite we embarked on a project of developing an _ exact _ theory of mode conversion in inhomogeneous plasmas , which is based on a new version of the invariant imbedding theory developed by us earlier.@xcite in that paper , we considered the mode conversion of the simplest kind , that is the conversion of obliquely - incident @xmath0-polarized electromagnetic waves into electrostatic plasma oscillations in cold , unmagnetized and stratified plasmas.@xcite using the invariant imbedding method,@xcite we were able to calculate the mode conversion coefficient and the electromagnetic field distribution for linear and parabolic plasma density profiles in a numerically exact manner . in some cases , there were substantial discrepancies between our results and previous theoretical calculations .",
    "the mode conversion phenomena in cold , unmagnetized plasmas are described by a single wave equation .",
    "a large number of wave propagation problems in more general situations , however , are described by two or more coupled wave equations . for the study of those problems , the invariant imbedding method needs to be generalized .",
    "this generalization was already made in ref .",
    "7 and has been successfully applied to various problems where several coupled waves propagate in inhomogeneous media .",
    "the propagation of electromagnetic waves in magnetized plasmas also involves several coupled waves . in this paper",
    ", we apply the theory developed in ref .  7 to the mode conversion of high frequency electromagnetic waves into electrostatic modes in cold , magnetized and stratified plasmas .    even in the relatively simple cases where the plasma is cold and stratified ,",
    "the mode conversion of electromagnetic waves in magnetized plasmas is a highly complex problem .",
    "there are three independent directions in three - dimensional space , which are the directions of inhomogeneity , the external magnetic field and the incident wave vector .",
    "the wave propagation and mode conversion phenomena depend on the relative orientations of these three directions . in the present work ,",
    "we limit our attention to one special configuration where the external magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to the direction of inhomogeneity and plane waves propagate in the plane spanned by the magnetic field and the inhomogeneity direction .",
    "other configurations will be considered in forthcoming papers .",
    "the theory developed in this paper can be applied easily to multi - species plasmas , which consist of electrons and different kinds of heavy ions . in this paper",
    ", we will consider only the propagation of high frequency waves and assume heavy ions to be immobile",
    ". rather complicated , but very interesting mode conversion phenomena associated with low frequency waves and ion density oscillations will be subjects of our future publications .    unlike in the unmagnetized case ,",
    "the wave propagation in magnetized plasmas is anisotropic . in a uniform plasma where the wave vector is not precisely parallel to the external magnetic field , the ordinary ( o ) wave and the extraordinary ( x ) wave are two independent eigenmodes .",
    "when the wave frequency @xmath1 is bigger than the electron cyclotron frequency @xmath2 , there can appear the o and x mode cutoffs and the x mode resonance inside the plasma . on the other hand ,",
    "if the wave frequency is smaller than @xmath2 , the o mode resonance can appear as well as the o and x mode cutoffs . in inhomogeneous plasmas ,",
    "the o and x modes are no longer true eigenmodes and are coupled to each other .",
    "these modes can also be converted to upper hybrid oscillations at the resonances .",
    "the presence of both a strong coupling between different modes and the singularity associated with resonance points makes the solution of the mode conversion problem very difficult .",
    "as will be demonstrated later , our theory allows us to obtain an exact solution of this difficult problem in a remarkably simple and efficient manner .",
    "mode conversion in magnetized plasmas has been studied extensively over several decades.@xcite we will not attempt to give a detailed review of the literature here . many of the previous works have used one approximation scheme or another , most frequently the wkb method . in a series of papers",
    ", mjlhus calculated the mode conversion coefficient for cold , magnetized plasmas primarily using the wkb method.@xcite this work , which was reviewed in ref .",
    "4 together with theoretical results of many other researchers , often predicts a complete mode conversion for certain parameters , in great contrast with our results . this discrepancy might be explained in large part by one crucial difference between mjlhus and our calculations . in the present paper , we consider only the cases where linearly - polarized waves are incident from a vacuum onto a stratified plasma , whereas mjlhus and other researchers have considered the cases where o or x waves are incident from a uniform plasma . upon entering the plasma ,",
    "linearly - polarized waves will be split into the o and x mode components . in the case of perpendicular inhomogeneity considered in this paper and",
    "when the waves are incident on a stratified plasma normally , mode conversion is caused solely by the x mode component . in this case",
    ", we find a perfect agreement between our result for incident @xmath3 waves shown in fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] and mjlhus result for incident x waves .",
    "when the waves are incident obliquely and for sufficiently large values of the parameter @xmath4 defined in sec .  [ sec4a ] , mode conversion is dominated by the incident o mode .",
    "this case is closely related to the theory of radio windows in the ionosphere and magnetosphere.@xcite we find that the critical parameter values where the mode conversion coefficient takes the maximum value agrees extremely well with the analytical formula , eq .",
    "( [ eq : win3 ] ) , obtained by previous theories , for sufficiently large @xmath4 .",
    "this is another evidence for the consistency between our theory and previous theories . for quantitative comparisons with previous results ,",
    "we need to generalize our method to the cases where o or x waves are incident from a uniform plasma",
    ". this generalization will be pursued in future research . since our theory is capable of producing exact results for realistic plasma density profiles ,",
    "we expect it will be useful in the interpretation of various radio modification experiments .    in sec .",
