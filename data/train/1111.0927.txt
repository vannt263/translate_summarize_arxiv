    "once beyond the horizon , the fluctuations became locked in as classical perturbations , eventually initiating the formation of galaxies and large - scale structure @xcite .",
    "generically , inflation predicts that these classical perturbations should produce a small , nearly scale - invariant spectrum of primordial density fluctuations .",

    "unlike for single - field models , both the initial conditions and one or more lagrangian parameters must be varied in order to fully test the range of scenarios arising from a given form of the lagrangian .",
    "we illustrated this point in @xcite by examining both two - field quadratic and power - law product potentials .",
    "for each class of potentials , we tested more than 10,000 scenarios by varying both a parameter value in the lagrangian and the initial conditions , in order to constrain the model using wmap data on the power spectra . rigorously constraining models like this is extremely time - consuming .",
    "rather than testing inflationary scenarios one by one like this , a more promising approach is to determine how constraints on the spectral observables in turn constrain the features of the inflationary lagrangian .",
    "clearly , features such as the geometry of the inflationary potential influence the evolution of the field perturbations , so the spectra should constrain the geometry of the potential . but",
    "in what ways do the spectra constrain the geometry of the inflationary potential ? is there a way to tell from cosmic data whether a one - field or two - field model can fit all measurements , as illustrated in figure  1 , or whether more fields are required ? and what is the role of nonstandard kinetic terms in determining the cosmic observables ? in this paper , we aim to give greater insight into these and related questions .    as background ,",

    "as we discussed in @xcite for the case of two - field inflation , this assumption often leads to large inaccuracies of up to a few orders of magnitude in estimating the mode amplitudes and the spectra ( see @xcite and references therein . ) hence , to accurately model the behavior of the unsourced mode , the expression @xmath159 should be used .",
    "that is , the integral of the effective mass for the @xmath65th mode , @xmath155 , most accurately gives that mode s relative change in the amplitude .",
    "now the effective mass @xmath155 depends on two quantities : the covariant hessian of the inflationary potential , @xmath160 and @xmath161 , where @xmath117 depends on the curvature tensor of the field manifold contracted with two field velocity vectors , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ r defn ] ) .",
    "since both are geometric quantities , this means that we can predict the behavior of @xmath136 by determining the geometry of the inflationary potential and field metric .",
    "take first the covariant hessian of the inflationary potential , @xmath162 .",
    "if the potential @xmath163 is covariantly concave up along the @xmath60 direction@xmath164this causes @xmath136 to decay .",
    "conversely , if the potential is concave down along the @xmath60 direction , @xmath136 will grow .",
    "a well - known example of this behavior is the adiabatic mode in single - field inflation , which is often likened to a ball rolling down a hill that speeds up or slows down depending on the concavity of its path .",
    "a second example is the @xmath141 mode in two - field inflation ; if the two - dimensional field trajectory lies in a valley ( concave up ) , then @xmath141 decays , but if it lies along a hill ( concave down ) in @xmath163 , then @xmath141 grows in amplitude .    the second geometrical quantity involved , the curvature term @xmath165 , involves the contraction of the riemann tensor of the field metric with two instances each of @xmath54 and @xmath60 .",
    "geometrically , it represents @xmath166 times the @xmath60 component of the failure of @xmath54 to be parallel - transported around a closed loop defined by the directions @xmath54 and @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , its contribution to the mode sourcing can in principle be determined from the geometry of the field metric and the potential .",
    "if this deviation from parallel transport of @xmath54 results in a positive component along the @xmath60 direction , then this causes @xmath136 to grow ; conversely , a negative value causes @xmath136 to decay .",
    "for example , in two - field inflation , since @xmath167 is proportional to negative @xmath168 times the ricci scalar of the field manifold , if the field manifold is locally elliptical , this will cause @xmath141 to decay , while a locally hyperbolic surface will cause @xmath141 to grow . note that if both @xmath162 and @xmath165 have the same sign , they will partially negate each other .",
    "therefore , we can view the effective mass as some sort of measure of the `` net curvature '' or geometry of the inflationary lagrangian along the single direction specified by @xmath60 .",
    "the corollary of eq .",
    "( [ delta phi_n intrinsic eom ] ) is that when @xmath136 is unsourced , the quantity @xmath169 is conserved in the superhorizon limit .",
    "for example , in single - field inflation , the @xmath131 mode is automatically unsourced , and hence the quantity @xmath170 is conserved . in inflation with two effective fields , the entropy mode @xmath141 is unsourced , so the quantity @xmath171 is conserved , allowing one to find a semianalytic expression for @xmath131 without needing to solve a set of coupled equations @xcite .",
    "therefore , it follows that _ eq . ( [ adiabatic conservation law ] ) is the multifield generalization of the well - known single - field conservation law for the adiabatic mode in eq .",

    "_ eq . ( [ adiabatic conservation law ] ) endows each of the @xmath6 modes with a conservation equation that holds whenever @xmath136 is not sourced  which happens when @xmath60 is not turning and the covariant hessian of @xmath163 has no off - diagonal components along the direction @xmath60 .",
    "so there are up to @xmath6 potential conserved quantities related to the modes .",
    "understanding a mode s effective mass is not just important in the absence of sourcing , but also when sourcing is important .",
    "for example , consider two - field inflation where the entropy mode @xmath141 sources the adiabatic mode .",
    "if the effective mass of the entropy mode @xmath141 is significantly large and positive , then the entropy mode will decay , thereby reducing the ability of the entropy mode to source the adiabatic mode . taking the limit where the effective entropy mass is very large and positive , we can neglect the entropy mode , and the evolution of the adiabatic mode is effectively single - field . in the opposite limit ,",
    "if the effective entropy mass is large and negative , the entropy mode will grow rapidly , resulting in much stronger sourcing .",
    "and this later scenario is also more likely to result in large non - gaussianity ( see @xcite ) . extrapolating to general multifield inflation",
    ", we expect that the size and magnitude of the effective mass @xmath155 plays a significant role in determining how much @xmath136 influences the evolution of @xmath172 .",
    "in particular , when the effective mass for the @xmath65th mode is very large and positive , the scenario is likely to behave like a multifield scenario with @xmath173 effective fields . in the particular case where all but one of the fields have a large and positive effective mass ,",
    "the scenario can effectively be treated as single - field with a reduced potential @xcite .",
    "before we consider sourcing in the general case , we first consider the mode interactions in the special case of quadratic potentials with canonical kinetic terms .",

    "moreover , the @xmath136 mode is sourced only when the @xmath60 basis vector rotates into the @xmath82 direction .",
    "this provides a very simple way to understand this special class of lagrangians in terms of the geometry / kinematics of inflation .",
    "it also explains why these scenarios are the simplest to solve : every mode obeys an equation of motion that is identical in form to the adiabatic mode .",
    "mathematically , the solution for the @xmath65th mode becomes @xmath197 in principle , one could solve the above series of integrals .",
    "finally , since there is no sourcing when @xmath198 , the number of kinematical basis vectors that are changing direction inversely indicates the number of conserved mode quantities .",
    "the results for quadratic potentials with trivial field metrics are not just interesting in and of themselves , but they provide a critical vantage point from which to understand the mode interactions in general multifield inflation , as we will show in the next section .      finally , we consider entropy mode sourcing in the general case .",
    "we start by discussing the three types of terms that can give rise to sourcing effects .",
    "then we discuss how general multifield inflation differs from the canonical quadratic case and how various order covariant derivatives of the potential affect the mode interactions .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ delta phi_n eom slow - roll ] ) , sourcing effects can arise from :    1 .",
    "off - diagonal terms in the mass matrix 2 .",
    "any nontrivial geometry of the field manifold 3 .   the kinematical basis vectors changing direction    we will consider each sourcing effect in turn .",
    "the first type of sourcing effect arises from off - diagonal terms in the mass matrix , which is defined as the covariant hessian of @xmath163 .",
    "these off - diagonal terms are measures of the coupling between fields in the potential and of whether this coupling results in a higher or lower potential energy state . but these terms can also be viewed as geometric effects because @xmath199 represents how much the @xmath65th component of the covariant derivative of @xmath163 varies along the @xmath200 direction .",
    "therefore the shape of the potential provides insight into this type of sourcing effect .",
    "if the coupling term @xmath199 is positive , then @xmath135 will cause @xmath136 to decay ; otherwise , if it is negative , it will increase the amplitude of @xmath136 .",
    "interestingly , since the mass matrix is symmetric , a nonzero @xmath201 leads to parallel sourcing effects ; for example , a negative value for @xmath201 will cause both the @xmath136 and @xmath195 modes to grow .",
    "the second type of sourcing effect arises from the curvature matrix @xmath117 .",
    "as explained earlier , the form of the kinetic terms in the inflationary lagrangian can be represented through a field metric , and this metric can be viewed as inducing a field manifold . if the field manifold has nontrivial geometry , then the riemann curvature tensor will be nonzero , and this will be manifested in the form of a nonzero symmetric curvature matrix @xmath202 .",
    "specifically , if the @xmath203 component of the failure of @xmath54 to be parallel transported around the closed loop defined by @xmath54 and @xmath60 is nonzero , then the curvature matrix will cause @xmath137 to source @xmath136 . since the curvature matrix can be factored into @xmath168 times a term involving the riemann tensor , this term technically combines geometric and kinematical effects ; so when all else is equal , the impact of noncanonical terms on the mode sourcing tends to be greatest at the end of inflation and whenever else the field speed is large . now like the mass matrix , since the curvature matrix is symmetric , a positive value for a given curvature matrix coefficient will cause both the @xmath137 and @xmath204 modes to grow .",
    "note that in comparison to the sourcing effects due to the mass matrix coefficients , the curvature matrix appears in the equation of motion with the opposite sign .",
    "thus , we may view the mass matrix and curvature matrix as representing sourcing effects due to the geometry of the lagrangian , with the mass matrix primarily corresponding to the potential and the curvature matrix to the field metric .

    "importantly , the coefficients of turn rate matrix allow @xmath136 to be sourced by only two modes : @xmath172 and @xmath195 . consider first the term @xmath207 in eq .",
    "( [ delta phi_n eom slow - roll ] ) .",
    "the kinematical term @xmath86 represents how quickly the @xmath60 basis vector is turning into the direction of the @xmath82 basis vector . since @xmath86 is always non - negative , this turning will always cause @xmath136 to grow . and",
    "the faster @xmath60 is turning into the @xmath82 direction , the more @xmath195 sources @xmath136 .",
    "this sourcing effect can be interpreted physically as follows : the direct rotation of the kinematical basis vectors causes what was once a @xmath195 mode to be partially converted into a @xmath136 mode .",
    "the other kinematical sourcing term , @xmath208 , can be understood similarly .",
    "however , this term causes @xmath136 to shrink in magnitude , which can be explained by the fact that @xmath136 is being partially converted into @xmath172 by the rotation of basis vectors .",
    "the anti - symmetry of the turn rate matrix neatly encapsulates these antithetical kinematic effects .",
    "though we have dubbed the third type of sourcing a kinematical effect , the question naturally arises as to whether the kinematics can be directly related back to the geometry of the lagrangian . in the case of a quadratic potential with canonical kinetic terms",
    ", we saw that this is the case and the turn rates can be expressed neatly in terms of the mass matrix coefficients .",
    "but in general this is not true , and the turn rates involve more complex combinations of the various @xmath65th - order covariant derivatives of @xmath163 .",
    "hence it is often easiest to view the effects from the turn rate matrix as kinematical effects , rather than a complicated combination of geometric effects .",
    "what is different in the general case of multifield inflation is that @xmath209 for @xmath149 and @xmath210 , producing additional terms in the mode sourcing equations .",
    "this can be seen by starting with the slow - roll expansion for the @xmath65th kinematical vector , @xmath211 \\boldsymbol{\\chi}^{(n - m+1)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which follows from differentiating eq .",
    "( [ eta slow - roll v1 ] ) for @xmath26 a total of @xmath65 times .",
    "for instance , the jerk is @xmath212 since @xmath213 has only three nonzero components in the kinematical basis , projecting the jerk onto the basis vectors gives @xmath214 notice the presence of the extra term @xmath215 where @xmath149 in each of the two equations above .",
    "it no longer vanishes because @xmath216 and instead it equals @xmath217 causing the turn rate @xmath218 to no longer equal @xmath219 : @xmath220 for @xmath221 .",

    "similarly , one can show that the next highest turn rate in the series is    @xmath225 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for @xmath226 .",
    "the result here differs from the simple quadratic case by the presence of terms that depend on the third and fourth covariant derivatives of @xmath224 , including the term @xmath227 . in general , one can show that @xmath228 where the `` corrections '' vanish for @xmath229 but otherwise depend on the higher - order covariant derivatives @xmath230 up to order @xmath231 .",
    "interestingly , plugging eq .",
    "( [ z relate to m ] ) into the entropy mode equation ( [ delta phi_n eom slow - roll ] ) tells us that the sourcing of @xmath136 by @xmath172 is controlled by these corrections arising from higher - order covariant derivatives :    @xmath232    similarly , we can view the sourcing of @xmath136 by @xmath195 to be controlled by a term that is twice the turn rate @xmath86 , plus corrections from higher - order covariant derivatives of @xmath224 .",
    "this results in a very interesting and useful way to view the interactions among modes : the interactions can essentially be divided into sourcing effects shared in common with canonical quadratic models ( @xmath86 terms ) and sourcing effects arising from deviations from this fundamental lagrangian ( the higher - order derivatives of @xmath224 and the corrections from the field metric , @xmath205 ) .",
    "taylor expansion of the inflationary potential with an understanding of the relative size of the various order terms in the expansion can therefore indicate how much each term @xmath86 differs from @xmath193 and hence the degree to which the scenario differs from the canonical quadratic case , as we illustrated above .",

    ", we connect these results to the cosmic observables . since most of these connections",

    "similarly , the number of unique nonzero components of the turn rate matrix determines the dimension of multifield inflation . in geometric terms , inflationary scenarios with canonical kinetic terms",
    "will produce trajectories lying along a line if single - field , a plane if two - field , and so on . this is illustrated in figure [ tubesfig ] . extrapolating to noncanonical kinetic terms",

    "where the @xmath54 basis vector never turns , the adiabatic mode is never sourced and the quantity @xmath233 is conserved in the superhorizon limit , just like in single - field inflation .",
    "however , the dimension of the perturbed fields can still be more than one if there are two or more fields during inflation and hence a power spectrum of entropy modes .    in the case where the field trajectory does change direction during inflation",

    "for example , if the @xmath55 basis vector is rapidly turning into the @xmath62 direction while @xmath54 also turns signficantly , then @xmath141 will be strongly sourced by @xmath239 , causing a boost in the amplitude of both transfer functions . as a second example , if the field trajectory rolls along a ridge in the potential while negligibly turning , then the @xmath141 mode will dramatically grow in amplitude , causing a boost in @xmath272 but only a small increase in @xmath274 . as a third example , if a strong negative curvature @xmath275 arises from the kinetic terms in the lagrangian and dominates the dynamics of the @xmath141 and @xmath239 modes , both modes will decay , thereby reducing @xmath272 and blunting the sourcing function @xmath274 .",

    "such post - inflationary processing is highly model dependent and depends on the dynamics of reheating . to make our discussion as broadly applicable as possible , we focus on the amplitudes of the isocurvature modes at the end of inflation , which can be construed as upper limits on the mode amplitudes .",
    "any post - inflationary model - dependent processing of the isocurvature modes is to be tacked onto these results by extending the transfer functions to encompass the whole evolution of the modes from horizon exit to the present era .",

    "the interactions among the field perturbations in multifield inflation are determined by the geometric properties of the inflationary potential and the field manifold .",
    "because the mode interactions serve as the critical bridge between the inflationary lagrangian and the cosmic observables , they can be used to compare inflationary models based on common geometric features that cut across several types of lagrangians .",

    "it is therefore critical to develop tools to understand how the mode interactions reflect the geometric properties of the inflationary lagrangian .",
    "while the mode interactions are well understood in the case of general two - field inflation and in some cases of multifield potentials , they are not well understood for an arbitrary multifield lagrangian .",
    "instead the @xmath2 formalism has been heavily relied on to calculate the spectra , which although powerful , does not provide much insight into the evolution of modes . in this manuscript , we attempted to extend previous work to uncover how the geometric and kinematical features of the lagrangian affect the interactions among modes , how this determines the effective number of active fields during inflation , and how this is reflected in the spectral observables .",
    "we started in section [ background fields ] by presenting the covariant equation of motion for the fields and by delineating a framework to parse the field vector kinematics .",

    ", we explored the equations of motion for the field perturbations in both the given and kinematical bases and showed how the evolution of modes reflects the geometry of the lagrangian . in the combined superhorizon and slow - roll limits , the equation of motion for the field perturbations depends only on the effective mass matrix @xmath115which represents the covariant hessian of the potential and the riemann tensor of the field manifold  and the turn rate matrix @xmath88 .",
    "we then studied the mode interactions one by one in the kinematical basis .",
    "we started by considering the evolution of the @xmath136 mode in the absence of sourcing , and we discussed how the concavity of the potential and the curvature of the field manifold determine that mode s instrinic evolution . in analogy to the adiabatic conservation law in single - field inflation , we showed that there are up to @xmath6 mode - related quantities in @xmath6-field inflation that may be conserved .",
    "next , we looked at sourcing . for quadratic potentials with canonical kinetic terms ,",
    "the mode equations simplify radically , in a way such that each mode @xmath136 can be sourced only by @xmath195 but only when the basis vector @xmath60 is turning into the direction of @xmath82 .",
    "for this special class of models , all turn rate matrix coefficients can be expressed in terms of the mass matrix , and all mode sourcing equations assume the same form as for the adiabatic mode .",
    "we then used this special case as a reference point for the discussion of mode sourcing in the case of an arbitrary lagrangian .",
    "we argued that the mode interactions in a general inflation model can be divided into features shared in common with canonical quadratic models and features that arise from higher - order covariant derivations of the potential and corrections from the field metric , and we advocated this approach as way to gain greater insight into how differences in lagrangians translate into differences in the cosmic observables . in parallel , we discussed the three types of sourcing terms : two are geometrical terms and one is kinematical .",
    "the geometrical terms involve off - diagonal terms in both the covariant hessian of the potential and in the riemann tensor of the field metric contracted with two instances of @xmath54 and modulated by @xmath168 , and we interpreted these terms geometrically .",
    "the kinematical terms are simply the turn rates of @xmath60 into the @xmath82 and @xmath61 directions and can intuitively understand as gains and losses in the amplitude of @xmath136 due to the rotation of basis .",
    "we also gave several examples of how inferences about the mode sourcing can be made by determining the geometric and kinematical features of a lagrangian .",
    "with this in mind , we focused in section [ cosmicobs ] on how the lagrangian geometry and kinematics determines the effective number of fields and how this number is reflected in the power spectra , bispectrum , and trispectrum .",
    "we pointed out that the effective number of fields needed to describe the background and perturbed solutions do not necessarily coincide , and we gave a method to determine the effective dimension of a multifield system in the slow - roll limit .",
    "next , we presented known formulas for the power spectra and generalized the two - field expressions for the local non - gaussianity parameters to multifield inflation .",
    "we found a new multifield consistency relation among @xmath323 , @xmath322 , @xmath288 , and @xmath245 for detectably large non - gaussianity to multifield inflation , and we discovered a _",
    "multifield observable _ involving the cross spectrum that can potentially distinguish two - field models from models with three or more effective fields .",
    "this result expressed is independent of post - inflationary processing of the modes .",
    "however , the caveat is that all four spectra must be detectably large and hence they do not apply in the case of scenarios such as complete thermalization after inflation .    stepping back and looking at the big picture , since more sensitive measurements of the spectral observables , along with new spectral observables , will reveal further clues into the nature of inflation , we must be posed to extract phenomenological information from these measurements . since it is impractical to test the myriad inflationary scenarios one by one against these measurements , it is important that we study types of geometric and kinematical features that arise from inflationary lagrangians and determine how these features affect the cosmic observables . this will allow us to work backwards from constraints on the cosmic observables to identify the key features of the inflationary lagrangian that described our early universe .",

    "<S> we develop an approach for linking the power spectra , bispectrum , and trispectrum to the geometric and kinematical features of multifield inflationary lagrangians . </S>",
    "<S> our geometric approach can also be useful in determining when a complicated multifield model can be well approximated by a model with one , two , or a handful of fields . </S>",
    "<S> to arrive at these results , we focus on the mode interactions in the kinematical basis , starting with the case of no sourcing and showing that there is a series of mode conservation laws analogous to the conservation law for the adiabatic mode in single - field inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we then treat the special case of a quadratic potential with canonical kinetic terms , showing that it produces a series of mode sourcing relations identical in form to that for the adiabatic mode . </S>",
    "<S> we build on this result to show that the mode sourcing relations for general multifield inflation are extension of this special case but contain higher - order covariant derivatives of the potential and corrections from the field metric . in parallel , we show how these interactions depend on the geometry of the inflationary lagrangian and on the kinematics of the associated field trajectory . finally , we consider how the mode interactions and effective number of fields active during inflation are reflected in the spectra and introduce a multifield consistency relation , as well as a multifield observable @xmath0 that can potentially distinguish two - field scenarios from scenarios involving three or more effective fields .    # 1@xmath1 </S>"
