    "<S> we consider andreev - majorana ( am ) bound states with zero energy on surfaces , interfaces and vortices in different phases of the @xmath0-wave superfluids . we discuss the chiral superfluid @xmath1he - a , and time reversal invariant phases : superfluid @xmath1he - b , planar and polar phases . </S>",
    "<S> the am zero modes are determined by topology in bulk , and they disappear at the quantum phase transition from the topological to non - topological state of the superfluid . the topology demonstrates the interplay of dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the zero - dimensional weyl points in chiral superfluids ( the berry phase monopoles in momentum space ) give rise to the one - dimensional fermi arc of am bound states on the surface and to the one - dimensional flat band of am modes in the vortex core . </S>",
    "<S> the one - dimensional nodal line in the polar phase produces the two - dimensional flat band of am modes on the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay of dimensions also connects the am states in superfluids with different dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the topological properties of the spectrum of bound states in the three - dimensional @xmath1he - b is connected to the properties of the spectrum in the two - dimensional planar phase ( thin film ) . </S>"
