    "recent results from the large hadron collider ( lhc ) show intriguing hints of what might be interpreted as a higgs boson . after having analyzed more than @xmath0 of integrated luminosity at 7 tev , the atlas and cms collaborations report excesses of diphoton events with invariant mass around 125 gev and local significances near @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "further support for this interpretation comes from exclusion ranges .",
    "the combined atlas and cms data constrain the mass of a standard model ( sm ) higgs boson to be within three possible ranges , namely , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and above 543 gev .",
    "these results have profound implications for physics beyond the sm . in this study , we consider the implications of these results for supersymmetry and , in particular , supersymmetric models with gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb )  @xcite .    in supersymmetric theories , the higgs boson s mass is generically low , since its quartic coupling is determined by the electroweak gauge couplings .",
    "radiative corrections may lift the higgs boson s mass , but in the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) , a higgs boson mass near 125 gev requires either large trilinear scalar couplings , leading to large left - right stop mixing , or very large stop masses . without additional structure ,",
    "naturalness would seem to disfavor heavy stops , since they imply significant fine tuning . at the same time ,",
    "heavy superpartners , at least in the first and second generations , generically relax other longstanding problems in supersymmetry , namely , those of unwanted flavor and cp violation .",
    "in fact , with generic flavor structures and phases , bounds on flavor and cp violation require superpartner masses to be much higher than even the masses preferred by the higgs mass . a realistic and compelling supersymmetric model , then ,",
    "should not only accommodate a 125 gev higgs boson , but also address these supersymmetric flavor and cp problems .    in gmsb models ,",
    "the superpartner masses are generated by flavor - blind gauge interactions , thereby solving the supersymmetric flavor problem elegantly .",
    "such models are therefore highly motivated in ways that generic supersymmetric theories , and particularly those with gravity - mediated supersymmetry breaking , are not .",
    "the recent higgs boson results present an interesting challenge for gmsb , however . in gmsb , trilinear soft couplings typically vanish at the messenger scale .",
    "although they are regenerated through renormalization group ( rg ) evolution at the weak scale , their value is too small to play a significant role in lifting the higgs mass , requiring multi - tev stops .",
    "the recent higgs results have therefore motivated many new gmsb studies , which typically propose non - minimal field content to resolve this tension  @xcite .",
    "the higgs mass constraints should not be considered in isolation , however , as gmsb has other significant and longstanding challenges .",
    "first , although gmsb elegantly suppresses flavor violation , it does not generically suppress the cp - violating electric dipole moments ( edms ) of the electron and neutron .",
    "these edm constraints are stringent : for @xmath4 cp - violating phases , and using the underlying gmsb relations to relate first and third generation superpartner masses , current bounds on edms require the stop mass to be larger than @xmath5 , depending on @xmath6 .",
    "second , typical gmsb models have no viable dark matter candidates , as all sm superpartners decay to gravitinos , and thermally - produced gravitinos  @xcite are inconsistent with standard big bang cosmology .    in this work",
    ", we note that all of these problems are simultaneously solved by having heavy superpartners .",
    "in fact , taking minimal gmsb as a simple example , the constraints all point to the same region of parameter space . as indicated above and detailed below , the higgs boson mass and edms point to the same range of multi - tev superpartner masses .",
    "remarkably , in this region of parameter space , the dark matter problem is also solved by goldilocks cosmology  @xcite , a superwimp scenario , in which tev - scale neutralinos freeze out with very large densities , but then decay to gev gravitinos that are simultaneously light enough to solve the flavor problem and heavy enough to be all of dark matter .",
    "this scenario is subject to many additional astrophysical constraints  @xcite : the resulting gravitino dark matter should have the correct relic density and be sufficiently cold , and electromagnetic and hadronic energy produced in the decays should not destroy the successes of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "as we will see , even more remarkably , all of these constraints are also satisfied in the same region in gmsb parameter space preferred by the higgs and edm constraints , without the need to modify standard big bang cosmology .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : gmsb ] , we discuss the implications of recent higgs data for supersymmetry and minimal gmsb in particular . the generic cp problem of gmsb and the implications of bounds on edms are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : edm ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cosmo ] we consider dark matter in gmsb , and discuss constraints from relic density , small scale structure , and bbn . as we will see , although the scenario we propose passes all constraints , for several observables , the favored region of parameter space is not far from current bounds .",
    "there are therefore several avenues where future sensitivities will be able to test these ideas , and we discuss these and conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , in the mssm the higgs boson is generically light , since the quartic coupling in the scalar potential arises from @xmath7-terms and is therefore determined by the electroweak gauge couplings .",
    "indeed , the tree level value , @xmath8 can not exceed the @xmath9 boson mass .",
    "this feature is retained even when supersymmetry is softly broken , since quartic couplings are dimensionless .",

    "although eqs .",
    "( [ treehiggs ] ) and ( [ higgs ] ) are modified significantly by higher - loop corrections , they reveal a few interesting features of the higgs sector in the generic mssm .",
    "first , increasing @xmath6 increases the tree - level higgs mass , an effect that saturates for @xmath15 .",
    "it is also evident that the higgs boson mass may be greatly increased either by large stop mixing ( @xmath16 ) or by heavy stops ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the large stop mixing scenario has been investigated in many papers recently . however , as we have reviewed in the introduction , there is ample motivation from considerations of flavor and cp violation to consider heavy superpartners .    as a particularly simple example , we consider minimal gmsb . in minimal gmsb",
    ", the low energy spectrum is completely determined by the five parameters @xmath18 where the first is the messenger mass , @xmath19 ( multiplied by a loop factor @xmath20 ) parameterizes the superpartner mass scale , and the last two are discrete parameters that denote the equivalent number of @xmath21 messengers and the sign of the higgsino mass parameter . regarding the higgs potential ,",
    "the soft scalar mass parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 are completely determined by gmsb ( and are essentially the same as the slepton doublet masses ) .",
    "the higgsino mass parameter @xmath24 and the soft bilinear parameter @xmath25 are more problematic to generate . here , we follow the traditional approach : we assume @xmath24 and @xmath25 are generated such that @xmath26 , and we trade them for @xmath6 and @xmath27 . assuming @xmath24 is real , the resulting free parameters are @xmath6 and @xmath28 .    because the above parameters are flavor blind , the resulting low energy physics is minimally flavor violating , and therefore safe from flavor problems , as long as contributions from gravity - mediated supersymmetry breaking are small compared to the superpartner mass scale .",
    "the gravity - mediated contributions are of the order of the gravitino mass @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the reduced planck mass , and so the latter condition may be taken to be @xmath31 . from this",
    "it follows that the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) . as for cp violation , the situation is less predictive , as we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : edm ] .",
    "one distinctive feature of minimal gmsb is that the @xmath32-terms vanish at the messenger scale .",
    "although they acquire a renormalization contribution proportional to the gaugino mass at low energy scales , their values are typically small , which , in light of the recent higgs signals , implies large stop masses .",
    "to see the parameters required to generate a 125 gev higgs mass in minimal gmsb models , we present results for minimal gmsb in fig .  [ fig : higgsedm ] . for @xmath33 , a higgs mass in the range of @xmath3 implies @xmath34 and stop masses @xmath35 , with smaller and much larger values required for other values of @xmath36 .",
