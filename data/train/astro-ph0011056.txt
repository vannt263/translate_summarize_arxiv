    "the determination of the distance moduli ( @xmath6 ) of the magellanic clouds plays an important role in establishing the cosmic distance scale .",
    "mostly due to the analyses of the hipparcos data , there is a renewed effort to pin down this crucial distance within an accuracy of better than @xmath7  mag .",
    "however , the question is far from being settled , and the lmc distance moduli obtained with various methods may differ by several tenth of magnitudes , stretching from the ` short ' ( @xmath8 , e.g. , stanek et al . 2000 ) to the ` long ' ( @xmath9 , e.g. , feast 1999 ) distance scales .    in the first paper of this series ( kovcs & walker 1999 , hereafter kw99 , see also kovcs 2000b ) we used rrd stars in galactic clusters to show that they yield @xmath10  mag larger distances than the ones inferred from the baade - wesselink absolute magnitudes of rr  lyrae stars .",
    "this result leads to @xmath11  mag for the lmc .",
    "when the same method is applied to the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) beat cepheids with 0.51  mag relative distance between the smc and lmc , we get almost the same @xmath6 for the lmc ( kovcs 2000a ) . in the present letter",
    "we directly extend the analysis to the macho rrd stars ( alcock et al .",
    "1997 , 2000 ) and show that these give larger distance as well , in fine agreement with the above mentioned independent data sets .",
    "we use the same method as in kw99 .",
    "this implies the utilization of : ( a ) multicolor data and reddening values on the lmc rrd variables ; ( b ) linear pulsation models ; ( c ) color  @xmath12  @xmath13 transformations given by the static stellar atmosphere models and by the infrared flux method ( irfm ) .",
    "when considering cluster rrd variables in the context of the lmc distance modulus , we need the same types of information , in addition to the knowledge of the relative cluster distances .    just briefly mentioning the essence of the method , and referring to kw99 for further details , we note that the pulsation equations yield a relation for the luminosity as a function of the periods , temperature and metal abundance @xmath14 } ) \\hskip 2 mm .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "there is also a dependence on other details of the chemical composition , but it has been proved to be rather weak at the relatively low metallicities of the rrd stars in our sample . from the observed dereddened colors we can get estimates on @xmath13 .",
    "the metal content [ m / h ] is preferably obtained from direct spectroscopic observations , but we may also assume that rrd and fundamental mode ( rrab ) variables have the same [ m / h ] in a given cluster and apply the method of jurcsik & kovcs ( 1996 ) to determine the metallicity of the rrab stars .",
    "once the luminosity is computed , using the bolometric correction formula of kw99 simply leads to the distance modulus through the comparison with the observed magnitudes .    in the following we give a more detailed description of the parameters entering in the calculation of the lmc distance modulus .    together with the earlier discoveries of alcock et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the recent analysis of more than 1300 short - period rr  lyrae stars led to a substantial extension of the known rrd stars in the lmc ( alcock et al .",
    "2000 ) . in the present analysis",
    "we include 181 rrd variables , which constitute _ all _ presently known rrd stars in the lmc .",
    "the macho instrumental magnitudes have been transformed to the standard johnson @xmath15 and kron - cousins @xmath16 colors according to the recipe of alcock et al .",
    "the periods and the average magnitudes are listed in table  1 .    for an independent computation of the lmc distance modulus we use globular cluster rrd data compiled by kw99 .",
    "relative distance moduli required by this method are checked by the photometric data of udalski ( 1998 ) and clementini et al .",
    "( 2000b , hereafter c00b ) .    the @xmath17})$ ]",
    "relations are derived from the stellar atmosphere models of castelli et al .",
    "( 1997 , hereafter c97 ) with the zero point adjusted to the irfm results of blackwell & lynas - gray ( 1994 , hereafter blg94 ) . the required color , @xmath18 and [ m / h ] data are obtained from clementini et al .",
    "it is important to remark that this approach assumes a uniform shift in @xmath19 between the irfm and theoretical scales , and that this shift is applicable throughout the relevant parameter regime ( i.e. , from dwarfs to giants ) .",
    "additional difficulty might occur because of the inaccuracy of the [ fe / h ] and @xmath18 values given by the irfm sources , or the neglect of the @xmath18 dependence in some of those works ( e.g. , alonso et al .",
    "1996 ; 1999 , hereafter a96 and a99 , respectively ) . furthermore",
    ", different colors may yield different shifts , producing inconsistency among the derived temperatures at a level of @xmath20 in @xmath19 . by considering various colors and overlapping samples in the irfm publications , our current estimates for the zero point differences ( in the sense of @xmath19  ( source ) minus @xmath19  ( c97 ) )",
    "are as follows : @xmath21  ( blg94 ) , @xmath22  ( a96 ) ; @xmath23  ( blackwell & lynas - gray 1998 ) ; @xmath24  ( a99 ) . here",
    "we use the scale of blg94 , because it is close to the one used in our previous studies and in the baade - wesselink analyses ( see kw99 ) . in sect .",
    "3 we will discuss the effect of the @xmath13 zero point on the distance determination . the final formulae , adjusted to the blg94 scale are the following @xmath25 } \\hskip 2 mm , \\\\",
    "\\log t_{\\rm eff } & = & 3.8928 - 0.4910(v - r_c ) + 0.0116\\log g \\nonumber \\\\               & + & 0.0012{\\rm [ m / h ] } \\hskip 2 mm .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as far as the metallicities are concerned , for the three galactic clusters ( m15 , m68 and ic4499 ) we use the data given in kw99 . for the lmc field",
    "there are very recent direct @xmath26 measurements by clementini et al .",
    ". the average [ fe / h ] value of their 7 rrd variables is @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 if the less accurate low - metallicity star is left out ) .",
    "here we accept @xmath29}=-1.5 $ ] for the lmc rrd variables . in principle , one should use variable dependent metallicity as it follows from the analysis of the period ratio diagram ( popielski et al .",
    "however , tests have shown that in the present context and data quality , this dependence has a rather negligible effect on the final conclusion .",
    "therefore , we use the same metal abundance for all variables in the lmc .    in order to compare the direct @xmath6 obtained from the lmc field rrd variables with the ones computed from cluster rrd stars",
    ", we have to know the relative distances and reddenings . in calculating these quantities",
    "we follow essentially the method of kovcs & jurcsik ( 1997 ) which employs the periods and the fourier decompositions of the light curves in computing the physical parameters of rrab stars . in the present implementation of the method",
    "we use only the period in deriving the relations for the reddening - free quantities ( e.g. , @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) .",
    "this approximation is necessary , because of the limited information available on the lmc ogle data set . nevertheless , the results are sufficiently accurate for the present purpose ( see also kovcs & walker 2000 ) .",
    "it is also possible to make a direct comparison between the colors and distance moduli of the rrd variables in lmc and ic4499 .",
    "since they both have very similar metallicities and periods , we may assume that their average intrinsic colors and luminosities are also very similar .",
    "the average quantities for the 181 macho lmc rrd stars are the following : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 . similarly , from c00b for the 10 rrd stars we get : @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 . the same quantities for the 15 rrd stars in ic4499 are the following :",
    "@xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath37 .",
    "simple subtraction of the corresponding quantities leads to the results summarized in table 2 .",
    "the close match between the relative distance moduli and reddenings calculated from the different data sets is very encouraging as far as the consistency among the photometric zero points are concerned .",
    "we note in passing that relative distance moduli calculated by the method of kovcs & jurcsik ( 1997 ) from the rrab variables of four lmc globular clusters also yield 2.04  mag for the average of the relative distances between those lmc clusters and ic4499 .",
    ".relative distance moduli ( lmc minus ic4499 ) and reddenings of lmc field rr lyrae stars [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     -0 mm    finally , to exhibit the distribution of the distance moduli derived for the individual stars , fig .",
    "1 shows these values as a function of the period .",
    "the huge scatter of the lmc stars is partially counterbalanced by their large number , which brings the statistical error down to @xmath4  mag for the distance modulus derived from these variables .",
    "this can be compared with the value of @xmath41  mag , valid for the galactic rrd stars .",
    "the largest contribution to the @xmath42  mag scatter of the lmc stars comes from the photometric errors . by using the error estimates of @xmath43 , @xmath44 ( see alcock et al .",
    "1999 ) we get 0.21  mag for the standard deviation of the individual distance moduli . we note that the result is most sensitive to @xmath45 . for example , with @xmath46 we get @xmath47  mag .",
    "the rest of the scatter comes from the metallicity dispersion , inhomogeneous reddening and possibly from the spatial extent of the lmc .",
    "the recent revision of the macho rrd magnitudes ( alcock et al .",
    "1999 ) enabled us to calculate the distance of the lmc directly from the observed magnitudes , colors and periods .",
    "this shows a very good agreement with the independent estimate based on galactic globular cluster rrd stars and smc beat cepheids ( kovcs 2000a ) .",
    "they all give @xmath48  mag , which lends further support to the ` long ' distance scale .",
    "the largest source of systematic error is the potential ambiguity in the zero point of the temperature scale .",
    "even this is not likely to cause the large effect , which would be necessary to lower the distance modulus by @xmath49  mag , the value required by some current estimates based on other methods ( e.g. , stanek et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this amount of change would demand about @xmath50k lower temperature scale than the one used in this work . since our adopted scale is only 100  k hotter than the presently published lowest infrared flux scale of alonso et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we think that it is highly unlikely that the required lowering of the distance modulus is possible by temperature change alone .",
    "consequently , we would need some ` conspiracy ' with metallicity , reddening or other parameters , so as to get the necessary decrease in the distance modulus .",
    "this situation is also not very probable , because , although the strongest effect comes from the metallicity , this is primarily differential i.e. , the distance moduli derived from the low metallicity clusters would not be seriously affected .",
    "this would lead to inconsistency among the distance moduli , because the relative distances , being empirically determined , are independent from the adopted metallicities .",
    "it is also worthwhile to mention that the metallicity values used in this and in our previous studies are in very good agreement with the ones published by independent spectroscopic studies and that these metallicities minimize the differences between the lmc distance moduli derived from various double - mode stars .",
    "we conclude that the application of standard temperature and metallicity scales leads to the ` long ' rr  lyrae distance scale , which , except for a drastic lowering of the temperature scale , is not possible to match with the ` short ' distance scale .",
