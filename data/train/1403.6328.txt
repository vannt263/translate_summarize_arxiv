    "animal movement is a fundamental process in ecology that affects interactions between individuals , their mates , prey and predators , and ultimately structures many of the properties of an ecosystem @xcite .",
    "movement has profound implications on the ecology and evolution of large classes of organisms including microorganisms , plants and animals .",
    "a key aspect directly regulated by organisms motion is the encounter process , the fundamental currency of all trophic and reproductive interactions .",
    "migrations , food or nutrient acquisition , mating , and hazardous meetings with predators , are all examples of dynamics regulated by encounters and hence directly controlled by the motion patterns expressed by organisms both at individual @xcite and collective level @xcite .",
    "it is relatively well understood how encounter processes depend on the relative velocities between individuals and on the perception distance of the searching animal @xcite .",
    "path geometry too is thought to play an important role , although a characterization of its impact remains elusive .",
    "examples of theoretical ideas and proposed metrics of path geometry include net - to - gross displacement ratio @xcite , searching efficiency @xcite , the statistics of run lengths @xcite , the diffusive - ballistic transition @xcite , composite random walks and patchiness @xcite , random walks , spirals and the wiener sausage @xcite , fractal dimension and space filledness @xcite .",
    "while this list is by no means exhaustive , it illustrates the wide variety of approaches adopted to assess the ecological relevance of movement patterns .",
    "one of the main goals of the theoretical frameworks above has been to determine how a given motion pattern contributes to the search efficiency of an organism .",
    "however , while the imperative for motion is primarily related to the search for resources , it is also fraught with risk .",
    "as well as incurring an energy cost , a moving animal becomes more conspicuous and runs the risk of blundering into a predator .",
    "one should expect that movement behaviour would balance the aforementioned risks against the necessity of searching for food @xcite .",
    "it is our contention that ecologically meaningful analyses of movement should try to infer features of the underlying trade - off from path geometry data .",
    "while path geometry is the outward projection of swimming behaviour , its relevance for the organism is the volume the path sweeps out in three - dimensional space and the number of prey and predators it encounters .",
    "this volume is inherently scale dependent , depending on the distance from the path within which detection can take place .",
    "the detection distance can vary for different classes of encounter ; it may be larger for large prey compared to small prey , and even larger for detection by a predator . with respect to the fitness trade - off",
    ", two relevant detection distances can be identified : the one at which the organism can detect its prey in the case of search , and that at which it can be detected by a predator .",
    "although the problem of motility , path geometry and trade - offs is common to many life forms , we discuss this here in the context of plankton .",
    "plankton inhabit a dilute three - dimensional environment , where there are few orienting cues , perception is limited , and the distances between individuals ( both predators and prey ) are relatively large . in such environment , movement assumes an important role , and while their fluid environment imposes movement in its own via currents and turbulence , many planktonic organisms , even algae , have locomotion ability .",
    "we thus focus on plankton motion in a quiescent fluid ; a condition easily reproducible in the laboratory , and occurring in many natural situations .",
    "planktonic organisms have been reported to swim with very tortuous paths . for high search efficiency",
    "this path should have very low overlap and correspond to a large swept volume for radius equal to the species detection radius . at the same time , a large overlap at a radius corresponding to the typical range at which predators can detect its prey would lead to a low exposure to mortality risk . in plankton ,",
    "the detection distance by a predator generally exceeds the detection distance for prey by about an order of magnitude @xcite leading at small overlap ( i.e. high encounter ) with prey and large overlap ( low encounter ) with predators .    in this paper , we propose a fast and accurate way of directly estimating self - overlap of zooplankton trajectories by means of a monte carlo scheme .",
    "we apply the method to a set of three - dimensional copepod trajectories and show that this measure highlights the change in the trade - offs for different species and gender , different swimming activities , and at varying food conditions .",
    "we want to calculate the volume @xmath0 swept by a trajectory characterized by a detection distance @xmath1 .",
    "we call @xmath2 the total length of the path and assume for simplicity that the perception distance is isotropic in all directions . then , taking into account the start and end points of the trajectory , the maximum volume swept out corresponds to the one of a straight line : @xmath3 depending on the tortuosity of the path compared to @xmath1 , a varying portion of the swept volume will be self - overlapping so that in general @xmath4 .",
    "it is then natural to define the _ scale - dependent self - overlap _ @xmath5\\ ] ] by definition , the admissible values of @xmath6 are between 0 and 1 , with @xmath7 when the trajectory never intersects itself , as for example in the case of a rectilinear motion , and @xmath8 when the trajectory is always visiting portions of space that have been previously scanned .",
    "moreover , @xmath6 is a strictly increasing function of @xmath1 and the probability of self - overlapping is very small at small scales , i.e. , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , while it is higher at larger scales , i.e. , @xmath11 , @xmath12 as sketched in figure  [ fig0 ] .     as function of detection radius @xmath1 . at small @xmath1",
    "the probability of self - overlap is low while for larger @xmath1 the self - overlap is higher .",
    "green and red areas are prey and predator detection ranges , respectively .",
    "the transition of @xmath13 from low to high values depends on path geometry . in the case of a random walk ( black curve ,",
    "[ rw ] for the analytical solution ) the transition is smooth .",
    "however , real organisms trajectories can be shaped to be more exposed to predation or shaped to reduce predation risk as hypothesised with the red and blue lines , respectively.,width=317 ]    measures of @xmath0 for real trajectories can not be obtained with simple analytical procedures .",
    "for this reason we employed a monte carlo algorithm , which is a computationally efficient tool , to estimate the volumes in eq .",
    "[ def_selfover ] ( see method section ) .",
    "the self - overlap measured for a subset of zooplankton trajectories in our database shows clearly the general patterns described above ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) .",
    "nevertheless @xmath6 appears to be highly variable especially in the transition from low to high values ( fig .",

    "[ fig1 ] and corresponding ( b ) encounter rates @xmath14 estimated from eq .",
    "[ enc_formula ] with @xmath15 . also reported @xmath16 and @xmath1 for comparison with ballistic and random trajectories , respectively.,width=317 ]    the variability in self - overlap is ecologically significant as it contributes to determining the encounter rates with prey and predators .",
    "the average encounter rate of an individual , taking into account the self - overlap , can be estimated as : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the swimming speed , @xmath19 the number density of encounter items ( prey , mates or predators ) , and @xmath1 the considered detection distance . for simplicity eq .",
    "[ enc_formula ] neglects any movement of encounter partners and the possibility of renewal of resources and assumes @xmath20 clearance efficiency ( i.e. , all items in the path are captured ) .",
    "further , @xmath21 must be considered as the long - term encounter rate , i.e. after a sufficient portion of space has been explored . under these assumptions , and since large self - overlap implies that on average the organism is visiting regions of space that have been already explored , we conclude that at large @xmath13 a consequent reduction of the encounter probability is obtained .",
    "the shape of the curve @xmath21 contains important information about the range of possible encounters of an individual and potentially about its fitness , which is enhanced by a high encounter rate with prey and a low encounter rate with predators @xcite . even taking into account self - overlap",
    ", @xmath21 is always an increasing function of @xmath1 , as larger detection radii always lead to larger encounter rates .    in the limiting case of a ballistic trajectory , @xmath7",
    ", @xmath21 is simply proportional to @xmath16 , while @xmath22 for a three - dimensional random walk @xcite .",
    "a correlated random walk presents both regimes : @xmath21 increases as @xmath16 at small scales and as @xmath1 at larger scales , with a crossover length set by the correlation length scale @xcite .",
    "the direct estimate of the encounter rate ( eq .  [ enc_formula ] ) for the self - overlap presented above ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) reveals that , depending on the specific trajectory , the function @xmath21 may present a variety of slopes and regime changes ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) .",
    "this is also a consequence of the complex geometry of the trajectories , which is not necessarily captured by a correlated random walk .",
    "although the eq . [ enc_formula ] require extra assumptions ( see above ) , the non - trivial regime changes of @xmath21 is determined only by the function @xmath6 , which is an assumption - free measure .",
    "for this reason we will concentrate in the following on the self - overlap function only .",
    "the motion behaviour of the marine calanoid copepods _ clausocalanus furcatus _ and _ temora stylifera _ show a variety of swimming patterns ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . _ c. furcatus _",
    "females employ different swimming behaviours depending on prey availability , showing continuous , highly convoluted and fast swimming when food is present ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) , and a set of regular geometric patterns with alternating swimming and sinking phases under food depleted conditions ( fig .  [ fig1]c ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast ,",
    "_ t. stylifera _",
    ", both females and males , perform only a cruising behaviour with regular loops in the horizontal plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b and d ) .",
    "the two species have similar size but quite distinct detection radii ( @xmath23 @xmath24 for _ c. furcatus _ and @xmath25 @xmath24 for _ t. stylifera _ , see methods section ) and have different swimming patterns that can also affect encounter rates with both predators and preys .",
    "the analysis of all the trajectories in the database shows a consistently larger self - overlap for _ c. furcatus _ than for _ t. stylifera _",
    "[ fig3]a ) .",
    "in particular , at a distance of @xmath26 @xmath24 , _ c. furcatus _ has a self - overlap approaching @xmath20 while _",
    "t. stylifera _ only @xmath27 . for both species the standard deviation of individual tracks accounts for @xmath28 on the measured @xmath13 at @xmath1 typical of the encounter with the prey .",
    "it is worth noting that the sharp transition in self - overlap of _ c. furcatus _ occurs at length scales typical of the transition between the encounters with prey and the encounters with predators ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) .",
    "indeed this species is efficiently scanning the water ( low self - overlap ) at a distance up to @xmath29 @xmath24 while it becomes quickly less efficient at larger scales . at @xmath30 @xmath24 ,",

    "also shown the expected overlap @xmath34 for brownian motion ( black line).,width=317 ]      to assess whether the self - overlap curves reflect the presence of regular patterns in the observed trajectories , we compared the experimental dataset with a ",
    "randomized  counterpart . from each trajectory ,",
    "a randomized version was generated by measuring all the segments between consecutive sample points , and all angles between consecutive segments . a new trajectory",
    "was then generated by randomly reassembling the segments and the angles .",
    "clearly , the randomized trajectory have similar statistical features compared to the original one ( including statistics of run lengths , correlation length and statistics of turning angles ) , but all regularities and large scale structures are lost .",
    "the comparison between real and randomized trajectories ( fig .  [ fig3]a ) shows that ( i ) randomized trajectories tend to have a much smoother transition between the regime in which the self - overlap is small , and ( ii ) the self - overlap of randomized trajectories is much lower than the one of real trajectories at the maximum radius considered .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the experimental curves with that of a brownian motion , which is often used as a model for animal motion .",
    "self - overlap of a brownian motion can be phenomenologically estimated as @xmath35 where we introduced the rescaled radius @xmath36 , being @xmath33 the correlation length of the brownian motion @xcite ( see harris @xcite for a more extensive treatment ) .",
    "such a comparison is presented in ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) , where the experimental self - overlap curves in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a are rescaled with their correlation length , and the black line is the theoretical prediction . as a consequence of the regular patterns in real trajectories ,",
    "the transition from low to high self - overlap is not always captured by the correlation length scale , but varies about one order of magnitude greater or smaller than @xmath33 . moreover a key feature of all curves is that the transition between the two regimes is much sharper than for a random walk .      local environmental conditions , such as food quantity and quality or population structure , are likely to affect swimming behaviour .",
    "when _ c. furcatus _ is exposed to depleted food conditions for a few hours , it drastically reduces its activity ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) , increasing the self - overlap ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) and reducing the average swimming speed @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this change in the kinematics is often correlated to a change in the swimming patterns , going from a fast cruising to a swim - and - sink behaviour , hence consistently increasing the amount of volume overlap for all the trajectories ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ) .",
    "the reduction of motion during unfavourable food conditions is consistent with both observations on other copepod species @xcite and theoretical considerations about zooplankton fitness optimization @xcite .",
    "feeding under risk of predation is dangerous and when food is scarce the pay - off for a low motility ( low risk ) strategy is higher than a bolder ( less safe ) one . in particular at @xmath37 @xmath24 a behavioural switch from cruising to a swim - and - sink patterns allows a significant increase in @xmath13 ( @xmath38 ) , which act in reducing the encounter probabilities with predators predicted by eq .",
    "[ enc_formula ] .",
    "sem ; shaded area : sd.,width=317 ]    it has been observed that gender can affect swimming behaviour in copepod species @xcite , with males constrained by the need of finding a mate and showing a bolder motility @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", females might show a more risk adverse behavior , likely in the attempt to secure their reproductive output . while there is no significant difference in the shape of trajectories displayed by females and males of _ t. stylifera _",
    "[ fig1]b and d , respectively ) , their respective self - overlap analyses do show distinct patterns .",
    "indeed males show a consistently lower self - overlap than females ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]c ) . moreover",
    "the rate of change of the self - overlap at large radius ( @xmath39 @xmath24 ) is always positive but significantly higher for females than for males ( 59% in average on the 110 @xmath24 interval ) .",
    "the motion of animals often display intriguing non - random features .",
    "it is not straightforward assessing how these features contribute to the fitness of the animal , and how they may change in response to changing environmental conditions . in this study",
    "we describe a method to quantify the effective volume explored by a moving animal by measuring the self - overlap associated with individual trajectories .",
    "this measure is a characteristic of the geometry of the trajectory itself and is provided as a function of a relevant length scale , which can be related to either the animal perception range or to that of its predators .",
    "moreover , it can be used in the calculation of encounter rate when specific speeds and detection distances are assumed ( eq .",
    "[ enc_formula ] ) .",
    "applications of the self - overlap to zooplankton trajectories show that the features of path geometry can be related to biologically relevant properties , such as gender , or to environmental conditions , such as different food concentrations .",
    "interestingly , the method has shown to not be influenced by the size of the organisms under study .",
    "the @xmath40 of self - overlap occurred at @xmath29  @xmath24 for _ c. furcatus _ , at @xmath41  @xmath24 for _ t. stylifera _ female , and at @xmath42 @xmath24 for _",
    "t. stylifera _ male .",
    "such differences in self - overlap could not be explained by differences in body size , with species length difference @xmath43 and no length difference in _ t. stylifera _ genders ( see methods ) .",
    "unlike other metrics that have been previously used to characterize swimming tracks , the self - overlap is an assumptions free measure of the effective volume explored by moving animals .",
    "when compared to estimates of the correlation length scale @xmath33 ( table  [ tab2 ] ) , the self - overlap proves to be more sensitive to changes in environmental conditions . indeed ,",
    "while both methods lead to similar conclusions regarding swimming behaviour in contrasting food environments or between genders , the self - overlap values always display lower standard deviation for the cases we analysed .",
    "moreover , when animals swimming behaviour includes a sinking phase , the corresponding correlation length scale is larger .",
    "this might erroneously suggest that sinking is a more efficient behaviour than cruising for encountering food and predators .",
    "the analyses of self - overlap clearly show that this is not the case .",
    "in fact , although the swimming is correlated on larger scales , swim - and - sink trajectories reveal that organisms were repeatedly exploring the same volume of water and the motion is then characterized by larger self - overlap and less efficient encounter rates .",
    "this result combined with the low speed observed during the swim - and - sink pattern @xcite would drastically reduce the encounter rate predicted by eq .",
