    "water ( h@xmath0o ) is the most abundant solid component of icy grain mantles in molecular clouds .",
    "previous theoretical studies demonstrated that the observed abundance of solid h@xmath0o in molecular clouds can not be explained by gas - phase synthesis alone ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore , h@xmath0o is mainly considered to be formed on the surfaces of interstellar grains .",
    "@xcite proposed a chemical reaction network by which the formation of solid h@xmath0o begins with hydrogenation of o atoms , o@xmath0 , or ozone , o@xmath1 , on the grain surfaces . since this proposal , many researchers have experimentally explored possible pathways for the formation of solid h@xmath0o under the simulative conditions of dense molecular clouds .",
    "these studies showed that solid h@xmath0o is produced through various surface reactions at temperatures as low as 10 k. the main surface reactions leading to the formation of solid h@xmath0o and some related to h@xmath0o formation are listed in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the simplest pathway toward the formation of solid h@xmath0o is the sequential hydrogenation of o atoms : @xmath2 @xcite proposed that reaction ( [ oh+h ] ) is the main route toward h@xmath0o formation in diffuse and translucent clouds in which h atoms are more prevalent than h@xmath0 molecules .",
    "several groups have experimentally approached these reactions using d atoms instead of h atoms .",
    "for example , @xcite sprayed d atoms over o atoms trapped in an n@xmath0o matrix at 12 k. the o and d atoms were produced by dissociation of , respectively , n@xmath0o and d@xmath0 under a dc discharge .",
    "@xcite codeposited o and d atoms produced by dissociating o@xmath0 and d@xmath0 , respectively , onto non - porous amorphous h@xmath0o ice at 10 k. more recently , @xcite deposited d atoms and @xmath3o ( instead of @xmath4o ) at 1525 k on a synthesized olivine surface .",
    "all three groups claimed that d@xmath0o ( hdo ) formed during their experiments through surface reactions ( [ o+h ] ) and ( [ oh+h ] ) ; however , other o - related species , such as o@xmath0 and o@xmath1 , were also present in or on the samples , and it was difficult to separate information relating to reactions ( [ o+h ] ) and ( [ oh+h ] ) from the different competing h@xmath0o - formation channels related to o@xmath0 and o@xmath1 , shown below .",
    "further studies are desired to isolate these reactions ( [ o+h ] ) and ( [ oh+h ] ) from reactions involving species other than h and o.    the second simplest formation pathway involves the sequential hydrogenation of o@xmath0 via the formation of hydrogen peroxide ( h@xmath0o@xmath5 : @xmath6 @xcite first revealed experimentally that these reactions proceed at 10 k and that a significant isotope effect is apparent for reaction ( [ h2o2+h ] ) but not for reactions ( [ o2+h ] ) and ( [ ho2+h->h2o2 ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that reactions ( [ o2+h ] ) and ( [ ho2+h->h2o2 ] ) have essentially no barrier @xcite , whereas reaction ( [ h2o2+h ] ) has a significant barrier of about 2000 k @xcite and requires quantum tunneling @xcite .",
    "after the experimental study by @xcite , extensive studies were performed on the hydrogenation of o@xmath0 at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite revealed that reactions ( [ o2+h])([h2o2+h ] ) occur even at 28 k. furthermore , it was found that the structure of the h@xmath0o ice formed through reactions ( [ o2+h])([h2o2+h ] ) is amorphous @xcite , which is consistent with the astronomical observations @xcite .",
    "the recent detection of h@xmath0o@xmath0 in the cloud core of @xmath7 oph a further supported the occurrence of these reactions on the surface of interstellar grains @xcite because gas - phase synthesis of h@xmath0o@xmath0 through reactions ( [ o2+h ] ) and ( [ ho2+h->h2o2 ] ) is not favored @xcite . in the gas phase , h@xmath0o@xmath0 formed through reaction ( [ ho2+h->h2o2 ] ) further dissociates into two oh species using the excess energy from h@xmath0o@xmath0 formation @xcite . in the solid phase , the release of the excess energy from reaction ( [ ho2+h->h2o2 ] ) into the cold surface will stabilize the formed h@xmath0o@xmath0 on the surface .",
    "even though the dissociation occurs , oh radicals are expected to recombine , resulting in the recovery of h@xmath0o@xmath0 ( reaction ( [ 2oh->h2o2 ] ) ) and/or the formation of h@xmath0o ( reaction ( [ 2oh->h2o ] ) ) , as follows : @xmath8    the reaction ho@xmath0 + h in the gas phase was theoretically predicted to follow two channels to produce h@xmath0o via an intermediate species as follows : @xmath9 where h@xmath0oo * and h@xmath0o .. o denote short - lived intermediate species @xcite .",
    "reaction channel ( [ ho2+h->od ] ) as a whole is slightly exothermic by 10 kj mol@xmath10 , whereas the latter part of the reaction ( h@xmath0oo * @xmath11 h@xmath0o + o(@xmath12d ) ) is highly endothermic by 151 kj mol@xmath10 @xcite , indicating that reaction channel ( [ ho2+h->od ] ) would not go to completion if the intermediate h@xmath0oo * dissipated the excess energy to a cold surface .",
    "reaction ( [ ho2+h->op ] ) has a huge barrier of about 9300 k , implying that the reaction proceeds only with difficulty , even with tunneling under astrophysically relevant conditions .",
    "furthermore , the branching ratio to produce o atom is only 2% for reaction of ho@xmath13 + h in the gas phase @xcite . although @xcite claimed that the reaction ho@xmath0 + h @xmath14 h@xmath13o + o occurred in their o@xmath0/h codeposition experiments , this reaction would be unlikely in the present experiment",
    ".    reactions of ho@xmath0 with h may also lead to the formation of h@xmath0 and o@xmath15 @xcite : @xmath16 in the gas phase , this reaction occurs much less frequently than reaction ( [ ho2+h->h2o2 ] ) @xcite .",
    "even if o@xmath0 were reproduced through reaction ( [ ho2+h->h2+o2 ] ) , it must be hydrogenated once again to yield ho@xmath0 and finally h@xmath0o@xmath0 like in the o@xmath0-hydrogenation experiments .",
    "the sequential hydrogenation of ozone ( o@xmath17 may occur in molecular clouds : @xmath18 the products ( o@xmath0 and oh ) may be further used for h@xmath0o formation .",
    "@xcite investigated these reactions at 10 k by irradiating solid o@xmath1 on h@xmath0o ice with d atoms .",
    "the reaction products were analyzed using temperature - programmed desorption ( tpd ) methods .",
    "@xcite performed experiments of the hydrogenation of o@xmath1 at higher temperatures ( 25 , 40 , and 50 k ) , and the reaction products were monitored in - situ by fourier - transform infrared ( ftir ) spectroscopy .",
    "both studies provided results indicating that the formation of h@xmath0o was initiated by reaction ( [ o3+h ] ) .",
    "note that oh is always produced along each of these three pathways : reaction ( [ o+h ] ) for the hydrogenation of o atoms , reaction ( [ h2o2+h ] ) for that of o@xmath0 , and reaction ( [ o3+h ] ) for that of o@xmath1 .",
    "hence , in addition to the h - atom related reactions shown above , the following h@xmath0-related reaction would lead to h@xmath0o formation : @xmath19 which has an activation barrier of @xmath202100 k in the gas phase @xcite . despite the large activation barrier of reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] ) , reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] )",
    "is often thought of as the most common route to the formation of h@xmath0o on grain surfaces in dense molecular clouds in which typical temperatures are about 10 k , the uv flux is very low , and h@xmath0 is the dominant h - bearing species over h atoms @xcite . at temperatures",
    "as low as 10 k , arrhenius - type reactions having an activation barrier of @xmath202000 k occur only rarely .",
    "therefore , reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] ) requires quantum tunneling to proceed on grain surfaces , as observed in the gas - phase reaction at low temperatures @xcite . the tunneling reaction is described in further detail in the next section .",
    "reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] ) was experimentally studied in the gas phase @xcite . in most previous studies ,",
    "oh was produced by photolysis of h@xmath0o or h@xmath0o@xmath0 , or indirectly by photolysis of n@xmath0o to generate o(@xmath12d ) atoms , which further reacted with h@xmath0o @xcite .",
    "oh generated through those energetic processes should have significant excess energy that should be sufficient to overcome the activation barrier of reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] ) .",
    "hence , to investigate whether reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] ) occurs through quantum tunneling on cold grains , non - energetic oh must be used for experiments . in recent experimental studies of low - temperature surface reactions ,",
    "oh radicals were produced through various reactions and were further used in secondary reactions .",
    "for example , hydrogenation of o@xmath1 yielded oh as a reaction product ( reaction ( [ o3+h ] ) ) ; however , oh formed in reaction ( [ o3+h ] ) could be highly energetic because the heat of the reaction ( @xmath2039,000 k ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is partitioned into oh @xcite , which is not suitable for investigating quantum tunneling reactions .",
    "we recently succeeded in producing cold oh by dissociating h@xmath0o in a microwave - induced plasma , followed by cooling to 100 k before reaching the reaction substrate @xcite .",
    "a similar technique for producing oh in the electronic and vibrational ground states was applied to crossed beam studies of reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] ) in the gas phase @xcite , where oh was produced in a radiofrequency - induced h@xmath0o plasma .",
    "we found that the cold oh can react with co and hoco on a substrate even at 10 k to yield co@xmath0 @xcite and h@xmath0co@xmath1 @xcite , respectively .",
    "moreover , it was experimentally demonstrated that cold oh reacts with another oh to yield h@xmath0o@xmath0 and h@xmath0o through reactions ( [ 2oh->h2o2 ] ) and ( [ 2oh->h2o ] ) , respectively , even at 40 k @xcite .",
    "consequently , our experimental method is useful for studying chemical reactions related to cold oh on the surfaces of interstellar grain mantles .    in the present study ,",
    "we first performed the codeposition of cold oh with h@xmath0 on a cold substrate to study reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] ) as a possible route to the formation of h@xmath0o on the surfaces of interstellar grains in dense molecular clouds .",
    "next , oh and/or h@xmath0 isotopologues , such as od and d@xmath0 , were studied experimentally in an investigation of the isotope effect on the reactions to decisively conclude that these reactions occur via quantum tunneling .      the thermally activated reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] ) is not expected to occur on grain surfaces at 10 k for the reasons given above . previous experimental and theoretical studies proposed that quantum tunneling plays a significant role in reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] ) in the gas phase , particularly at low temperatures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite described the importance of quantum tunneling in various chemical reactions on low - temperature grain surfaces in molecular clouds . under the simple assumption that a reaction occurs through a rectangular barrier of height @xmath21 and width @xmath22 on a potential energy surface , the rate of a quantum tunneling reaction ( @xmath23 is approximately represented by the following equation : @xmath24 , } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the frequency of harmonic motion and particle mass , respectively . in the case of a bimolecular atom - transfer reaction represented by a + xb @xmath11 ax + b , the center of mass translated from the initial state ( a + xb ) to the final state ( ax + b ) of a reaction on the potential energy surface",
    "is represented as the effective mass @xmath27 which is defined by the following equation : @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are the masses of a , x , and b atoms , respectively , @xmath32 is the mass of the linear triatomic molecule axb ( @xmath32 = @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the ratio of the infinitesimal change of one bond distance to that of the other bond distance @xcite .",
    "when bimolecular atom - transfer reactions a + xb @xmath11 ax + b proceed through quantum tunneling , an effective mass @xmath27 should be used to indicate the tunneling mass in equation ( [ tunneling ] ) @xcite .",
    "observation of an isotope effect on a reaction can be an indicator of quantum tunneling .",
    "this is because tunneling effects strongly depend on the particle mass , such that a tunneling reaction involving a species with a lighter effective mass proceeds faster than with a heavier effective mass .",
    "previous studies have investigated the isotope effect on other astrophysically relevant chemical reactions around 10 k. @xcite performed hydrogenation / deuteration of solid co at 1020 k and found that hydrogenation of co proceeds faster than deuteration of co by a factor of about 12 .",
    "d isotope exchange reactions of methanol ( ch@xmath1oh ) were also demonstrated to occur through quantum tunneling @xcite , which would contribute to the observed abundance of deuterated methanol , such as chd@xmath0oh .",
    "the importance of the effective mass on quantum tunneling reactions has been demonstrated experimentally .",
    "@xcite extensively investigated h - d exchange reactions of formaldehyde ( h@xmath0co ) at 1020 k. the effective mass of the d - atom abstraction by h atoms from d@xmath0co is @xmath201 , whereas that of the h - atom abstraction by d atoms from h@xmath0co is @xmath200.5 , which affects the rate of each reaction @xcite .",
    "most quantum tunneling surface reactions previously studied were h- and d - atom - related reactions .",
    "previous experimental studies of h@xmath0-related quantum tunneling reactions have investigated the isotope effect on the reactions of methyl radicals ( ch@xmath17 or its deuterated species ( e.g. chd@xmath0 and cd@xmath17 in solid parahydrogen ( @xmath35 5300 k ) at 5 k @xcite .",
    "although these pioneering studies are important for understanding quantum tunneling reactions related to h@xmath0 , their relevance to astrophysics is rather weak because their experiments were conducted under unfeasible conditions ( in a parahydrogen matrix at 5 k ) in molecular clouds .    in the present study ,",
    "we experimentally examined surface reactions related to h@xmath0 and oh isotopologues , as shown below , to investigate the isotope effects on reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] ) : @xmath36 the use of isotopically substituted hydrogen ( hd or d@xmath5 or hydroxyl radical ( od ) in place of h@xmath0 or oh , respectively , can alter the effective mass of a reaction relative to that of reaction ( 12 ) . in this case",
    ", the rate of a quantum tunneling reaction should differ from that of reaction ( 12 ) as well . reported values of the activation barrier and the calculated effective mass for each reaction are summarized in table [ tbl-2 ] . according to @xcite , the value of @xmath34 in equation ( [ mass ] ) was set to 1 in the present reaction system .",
    "an observation that the efficiency of each reaction varied according to the effective mass would strongly indicate that these reactions proceed through quantum tunneling .",
    "experiments were performed using the apparatus for surface reaction in astrophysics system .",
    "details of this apparatus and experimental conditions have been described previously @xcite .",
    "briefly , oh radicals , together with h atoms , were produced by the dissociation of h@xmath0o in a microwave discharge plasma @xcite in a pyrex tube .",
    "dissociation can lead directly to the formation of h@xmath0 and o. the species produced in the oh source are denoted `` h@xmath0o fragments '' in this paper .",
    "h@xmath0o fragments were transferred via a series of poly(tetrafluoroethylene ) and a cold aluminum ( al ) tube , which was connected to a he refrigerator , and they impinged on the substrate .",
    "initially , oh radicals may be excited when formed in the plasma , but after many collisions with the inner wall of a cold al pipe , they are thermalized to 100 k. that is , they should be vibrationally and electronically in the ground state before reacting on the substrate , as demonstrated in gas - phase collision experiments @xcite .",
    "this was confirmed experimentally , as described in the next section .",
    "the deposition rate of oh radicals was not measured directly ; the upper limit of the deposition rate should be 1.5 @xmath37 10@xmath38 radicals @xmath39 s@xmath10 , which is equal to the deposition rate of h@xmath0o when the microwave source is turned off .",
    "h@xmath0 molecules delivered from a separate gas line through a capillary plate were codeposited with the h@xmath0o fragments onto the substrate over 60 minutes .",
    "the flux of h@xmath0 was calculated to be 2.0 @xmath40 10@xmath41 molecules @xmath39 s@xmath10 based on the measured pressure inside the main chamber when filled with only h@xmath0 .",

    "the desorbed species from the substrate were monitored using a quadrupole mass spectrometer ( qms ) .",
    "the temperature of the substrate , which was connected to another he refrigerator , was kept at 10 k in each experiment .",
    "the reactions in table [ tbl-2 ] did not occur if the codeposition experiments were performed at temperatures above 20 k.    after codeposition , the tpd spectra were obtained by the qms at a heating rate of 4 k minutes@xmath10 .    in the experiments using h@xmath0- and oh - isotopologues ,",
    "the hd and d@xmath0 fluxes were the same as the h@xmath43 flux .",
    "qms measurements and a resonance - enhanced multiphoton ionization ( rempi ) method ( see section 2.2 ) confirmed that almost all ( @xmath4495% ) d@xmath0o or h@xmath0o introduced into the radical source was fragmented when the microwave source was turned on . on this basis , the deposition rate of od was considered to be similar to that of oh because the flow rates of d@xmath0o and h@xmath0o into the radical source were adjusted to the same value .",
    "the direct detection of oh from the source was performed using another apparatus , named rascal , in our laboratory .",
    "rascal is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "oh from the radical source was selectively ionized by ( 2 + 1 ) rempi approximately 5 mm from the exit of the aluminum pipe and detected using a time - of - flight mass spectrometer .",

    "the constants associated with the relevant electronic states were compared with those in the literature @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1](b ) shows the results of a spectral simulation of oh(@xmath45=0 ) assuming a rotational temperature of 300 k. by comparison with the spectral simulation , the oh(@xmath45=0 ) from the radical source was expected to be almost thermally equilibrated with the al pipe before reacting on the substrate .    in an additional step",
    ", the adsorbates were photodesorbed using the weak second harmonic radiation ( 532 nm ) of a nd : yag laser and were analyzed by the rempi method .",
    "we detected oh(@xmath45=0 ) signals in the species photodesorbed from the cold substrate ( 1040 k ) during the deposition of h@xmath0o fragments .",
    "photolysis of h@xmath0o or h@xmath0o@xmath0 on the substrate , which could be potential sources for oh(@xmath45=0 ) , was negligible at 532 nm @xcite ; therefore , this result clearly indicates the presence of oh in the electronic and vibrational ground states on the substrate at 10 k. the rotational temperature of the photodesorbed oh(@xmath45=0 ) was about 100 k. this value is slightly higher than the substrate temperature .",
    "the oh radical is considered to gain a small amount of energy during photostimulated desorption .",
    "the present results are consistent with previous experimental results obtained using a similar method at 3.5 k @xcite .",
    "the deposition only of h@xmath0o fragments on a substrate at 10 k resulted in the formation of h@xmath0o , h@xmath0o@xmath0 , and o@xmath1 , as identified in the product ir spectrum at 1650 , 1400 , and 1040 cm@xmath10 , respectively ( figure [ fig2](a ) ) .",
    "hereafter , this experiment is denoted as the h@xmath13o - fragment deposition .",
    "in contrast , these molecules were not observed in the h@xmath0o - fragment deposition at 60 k @xcite .",
    "if h@xmath0o , h@xmath0o@xmath0 , and o@xmath1 formed in the gas phase , they should be adsorbed on the substrate even at 60 k , which is well below their desorption temperatures .",
    "we therefore concluded that these molecules were formed through surface reactions at 10 k. the formation pathways of these molecules are described in our recent paper @xcite .",
    "the peak area for each reaction product increased linearly with the deposition time .",
    "in addition to the three types of molecules listed above , qms measurements revealed that h@xmath0 and o@xmath0 , which are infrared - inactive , are present in the gases from the source and/or are produced on the surface .",
    "figure [ fig2](b ) shows the ir spectrum of the reaction product obtained after codeposition of h@xmath0o fragments with h@xmath0 .",
    "this spectrum was obtained under the same experimental conditions as those for the h@xmath13o - fragment deposition : the deposition rate of oh , the experimental time , and substrate temperatures .",
    "the resulting spectrum was similar to that obtained in the h@xmath13o - fragment deposition , although the peak area associated with the oh bending of h@xmath0o ( 1650 @xmath53 increased by a factor of two compared to that observed in the h@xmath13o - fragment deposition ( figure [ fig2](c ) ) .",
    "this result indicates that the introduced h@xmath0 was used for the formation of h@xmath0o through surface reactions with o - related species , such as oh , o , o@xmath0 , and/or o@xmath1 .",
    "we concluded that h@xmath0o was formed by reaction of h@xmath0 with oh ( reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] ) ) on the surface at 10 k , despite the relatively large barrier @xmath21 of about 2100 k @xcite , for the following reasons .",
    "first , we confirmed that codeposition of h@xmath0 with cold o atoms produced by the dissociation of o@xmath0 in a microwave - induced plasma did not result in a reaction at 10 k , except that o@xmath1 formed ( y. oba et al . , unpublished data ) .",
    "this result indicates that cold o atoms in an h@xmath0o plasma will not react with h@xmath0 either .",
    "this is in good agreement with the fact that the reaction , @xmath54 is endothermic by 8 kj mol@xmath10 (= 960 k ) with a significant activation barrier of 3160 k @xcite , although theoretical studies assumed h@xmath0o formation begins with reaction ( 22 ) @xcite .",
    "second , o@xmath0 never reacts with h@xmath0 under the present experimental conditions .",
    "third , o@xmath1 does not react with h@xmath0 , as experimentally demonstrated previously @xcite .",
    "in addition , if ho@xmath0 is produced through reactions of the h@xmath0o fragments , it may react with h@xmath0 to yield h@xmath0o@xmath0 : @xmath55 in this case , the h@xmath0o@xmath0 produced may further yield h@xmath0o through reaction ( [ h2o2+h ] ) .",
    "this , however , is unlikely in the present experiment because reaction ( [ ho2+h2 ] ) is highly endothermic with a considerable activation barrier ( table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "the column density of the h@xmath0o product was calculated from the peak area of the oh bending band at 1650 cm@xmath10 and the previously reported integrated band strengths , as described in @xcite .",
    "the band strength used was 1.2 @xmath40 10@xmath56 cm molecules@xmath10 which is by a transmission method @xcite .",
    "we confirmed that the ratio of the band strengths for oh stretching and bending bands of h@xmath13o is almost independent of the method ( transmission or reflection ) . while , the difference in the absolute value of band strengths for the reflection and the transmission methods was found to be within the factor of two in our experimental setup @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to determine the exact column density even by the transmission method in the layered and the mixed samples .",
    "however , since our discussion is based on relative reaction yields , the difference in the absolute value of the band strengths between the two methods little alters the present experimental results and discussion .    by subtracting the h@xmath0o band obtained in the h@xmath0o - fragment deposition from that obtained in the codeposition experiment",
    ", we determined the increase in the column density of h@xmath0o through reaction ( 12 ) to be 3.5 @xmath40 10@xmath57 molecules @xmath39 .",
    "note that it is not obvious whether h@xmath13o yield obtained by the subtraction gives the total yield of h@xmath13o by the reaction oh + h@xmath13 . in the h@xmath13o - fragment deposition ,",
    "two competing reactions produce h@xmath13o : reactions ( [ 2oh->h2o ] ) and ( [ oh+h2 ] ) . in the codeposition experiment ,",
    "additional h@xmath13 molecules enhance reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] ) .",
    "that is , a part of oh amount which was used by reaction ( [ 2oh->h2o ] ) in the h@xmath13o - fragment deposition may be consumed by reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , h@xmath13o column density obtained by the subtraction may be underestimated compared to the total yield of h@xmath13o by reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] ) in the codeposition .",
    "further details on this issue are shown in the next section .    accompanied by the increase in the h@xmath0o column density , the peak area of the oh bending in h@xmath0o@xmath0 at 1400 cm@xmath10 decreased relative to the peak area measured in the h@xmath0o - fragment deposition ( figure [ fig2](c ) ) .",
    "this is probably because the abundant h@xmath0 which was codeposited with h@xmath0o fragments inhibited the formation of h@xmath0o@xmath0 through reaction ( [ 2oh->h2o2 ] ) ( oh + oh @xmath11 h@xmath0o@xmath5 ; the oh fragments instead formed h@xmath0o via reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] ) .",
    "reaction ( [ oh+h ] ) ( oh + h @xmath11 h@xmath0o ) was assumed to contribute to h@xmath0o formation only to a minor extent in the present study because most h atoms in the h@xmath0o fragments must be consumed by h ",
    "h recombination on the surface or few h atoms were present in the gases from the source .",
    "in fact , the codeposition of o@xmath0 with the h@xmath0o fragments did not increase the amount of h@xmath0o@xmath43 relative to the h@xmath0o - fragment deposition , despite the barrierless mechanism for o@xmath0 hydrogenation .",
    "the absorption at 1040 cm@xmath10 due to o@xmath1 was not observed in the codeposition experiment ( figure [ fig2](b ) ) .",
    "it is possible that o@xmath1 was consumed by h atoms ( reaction ( [ o3+h ] ) ) that formed through reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] ) and/or the o atoms were similarly consumed by h atoms ( reaction ( [ o+h ] ) ) prior to the formation of o@xmath1 ( o@xmath0 + o @xmath11 o@xmath17 .",
    "reactions ( [ o+h ] ) and ( [ o3+h ] ) yield energetic oh , which may further react with h@xmath0 to yield h@xmath0o through reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] ) . even if this were the case , the low o@xmath1 column density produced in the h@xmath0o - fragment deposition ( 0.6 @xmath40 10@xmath57 molecules @xmath58 suggested that such reactions did not significantly contribute to the observed h@xmath0o column density .",
    "nevertheless , a lack of o@xmath1 could provide indirect evidence that the reaction oh + h@xmath0 occurred .",

    "the formation of hdo should thus provide direct evidence that reaction ( [ od+h2 ] ) occurs at 10 k.    formation of d@xmath0o , d@xmath0o@xmath0 , and o@xmath1 was observed in the product ir spectrum upon the sole deposition at 10 k of d@xmath0o fragments ( figure [ fig3](a ) ) ( hereafter , this experiment is denoted as the d@xmath13o - fragment deposition ) , which were produced in a manner similar to that used to produce h@xmath0o fragments .",
    "these results indicated that the isotopic substitution of h@xmath0o fragments did not significantly alter the reaction pathways on the cold substrate .",

    "d@xmath0o@xmath0 was assumed to form via the reaction od + od , and it may be consumed in the presence of codeposited hd ; however , variations in the d@xmath0o@xmath0 column density could not be estimated because the od bending band of d@xmath0o@xmath0 at 1000 cm@xmath10 mixed with the bands corresponding to other species , such as o@xmath1 ( figure [ fig8](b ) ) .",
    "we found that h@xmath0o and its isotopologues ( hdo and d@xmath0o ) form through surface reactions of oh or od with h@xmath0 , hd , or d@xmath0 at 10 k , and we determined the column densities of the reaction products in previous sections ( sections 3.13.5 ) .",

    "although we verified by qms and rempi that almost all h@xmath0o and d@xmath0o molecules were fragmented when the plasma was turned on , unfortunately , the oh flux was not guaranteed to be identical to the od flux , which makes the determination of the accurate relative efficiencies difficult in the present study .",
    "nevertheless , the oh and od fluxes did not vary significantly from one another because the column densities of the reaction products , such as h@xmath0o or h@xmath0o@xmath0 in the h@xmath13o - fragment deposition , were comparable to those of the isotopic counterparts , such as d@xmath0o and d@xmath0o@xmath0 , in the d@xmath13o - fragment deposition .",
    "the reactions listed in table [ tbl-2 ] are divided into three groups based on the efficiency of each reaction relative to reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] ) : reactions with comparable efficiency ( reactions ( [ od+h2 ] ) , ( [ oh+hd->h2o ] ) , and ( [ od+hd->hdo ] ) ) , reactions one order of magnitude less efficient ( reactions ( [ oh+d2 ] ) and ( [ od+d2 ] ) ) , and reactions of undetermined efficiency ( reactions ( [ oh+hd->hdo ] ) and ( [ od+hd->d2o ] ) ) . for convenience , hereafter , these three groups are denoted a , b , and c , respectively . although the difference in the barrier height ( @xmath67 among the reactions listed in table [ tbl-2 ] is small ( @xmath68400 k ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , it is remarkable that a considerable isotope effect was clearly observed in groups a and b. the reactions differed intrinsically depending on whether the reaction involved h- or d - atom abstraction , and the effective masses were comparable within a reaction group , as shown in table [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "the effective masses for the reactions in group b ( 0.90 ) were almost twice as large as those in group a ( 0.47 ) .",
    "the inverse correlation between efficiency and the effective mass of reactions is a typical feature of quantum tunneling because the tunneling rate decreases considerably as the effective mass of a reaction increases , as expected from equation ( [ tunneling ] ) .",
    "the efficiencies of the reactions in group c can be determined from the increase in the column density of hdo or d@xmath0o in reaction ( [ oh+hd->hdo ] ) or ( [ od+hd->d2o ] ) , respectively .",
    "the efficiency of reaction ( [ oh+hd->hdo ] ) could potentially be estimated in a straightforward way by calculating the column density of hdo formed through the reaction .",
    "this was not possible , however , because the od - stretching band at 2435 cm@xmath10 , which was used to calculate the hdo column densities in the present study , included a significant contribution from d@xmath0o@xmath0 , as explained above .",
    "the efficiency of reaction ( [ od+hd->d2o ] ) could potentially be estimated from the increase in the d@xmath0o column density as a result of the reaction .",
    "the difference between the spectra of the codeposition and the d@xmath13o - fragment deposition samples ( figure [ fig8](b ) ) shows , however , that the d@xmath0o column density did not increase ; rather , it decreased with the codeposition of hd .",
    "we could not , therefore , calculate the increase in d@xmath0o column density through reaction ( [ od+hd->d2o ] ) .",
    "the efficiencies of the reactions in group c were thought to be comparable to those in group b because the effective masses are identical , i.e. the reactions in group c were less efficient than those in group a. a summary of the discussion in this section is schematically illustrated in figure [ fig9 ] , which clearly shows that oh and od preferentially abstract h atom from hydrogen molecules ( h@xmath13 or hd ) , leading to h@xmath13o and hdo , respectively .",
    "the present study demonstrated that reactions between oh and h@xmath0 yield h@xmath0o on a solid surface at 10 k , despite a large activation barrier ( 2100 k ) for the reaction @xcite .",

    "this is the first experimental result to isolate reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] ) and to show that reactions related to h@xmath0 actually yielded h@xmath0o .",
    "although in a recent theoretical model , @xcite assumed that reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] ) does not occur on grain surfaces in dense clouds because of the activation barrier , the present experimental result strongly suggests that models should include reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] ) as the efficient route .",
    "we propose that solid h@xmath0o in dense molecular clouds is mostly formed by the following three surface reactions : oh + h ( reaction ( [ oh+h ] ) ) , oh + h@xmath0 ( reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] ) ) , and h@xmath0o@xmath0 + h ( reaction ( [ h2o2+h ] ) ) .",

    "the upper limit for the h@xmath0o@xmath0 ice abundance relative to h@xmath0o in several protostars and field stars was estimated based on laboratory ir spectra of h@xmath0o@xmath0/h@xmath0o mixed ice and was found to be 9% @xmath71 4% @xcite .",
    "in addition , laboratory experiments clearly demonstrated that h@xmath13o formation through o@xmath13 hydrogenation is efficient under conditions of dense molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in addition to the main routes mentioned above , various reactions were proposed that could lead to the formation of h@xmath0o and other species , such as h@xmath0o@xmath0 and oh ( table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "these reactions were assumed to make only small contributions to the observed abundance of solid h@xmath0o in dense clouds .",
    "for example , although hydrogenation of o@xmath1 was proposed as an important route to the formation of solid h@xmath0o in dense clouds in previous theoretical @xcite and experimental studies @xcite , we suspect that the contribution of this reaction to h@xmath0o formation is small .",
    "o@xmath1 formation is not favored on grain surfaces because the mobility and flux of h atoms is higher than the corresponding properties of o atoms , which prohibits formation of o@xmath1 by consuming o atoms ( reaction ( [ o+h ] ) ) and/or o@xmath0 ( reaction ( [ o2+h ] ) ) prior to o@xmath1 formation .",
    "our conclusion is consistent with the theoretical model proposed by @xcite , who estimated the efficiencies of reactions ( [ oh+h ] ) , ( [ h2o2+h ] ) , and ( [ oh+h2 ] ) in dense clouds at 10 k to be 6% , 17% , and 77% , respectively .    the formation of solid hdo was experimentally demonstrated to occur in the present study .",

    "@xcite discussed the formation of h@xmath0o , hdo , and d@xmath0o through reactions of oh with h@xmath0 , hd , and d@xmath0 , respectively , on ice - covered dust grains in dense molecular clouds .",
    "they assumed that the reaction oh + hd is barrierless , and proposed that the h@xmath0o and hdo form statistically in a ratio of 2:1 , respectively , from the intermediate h@xmath0do . based on these assumptions , this group claimed that the astronomically observed hdo / h@xmath0o ratio could be explained according to their model ; however , the reactions of oh / od with h@xmath0/hd / d@xmath0 do have a barrier , as demonstrated in previous experimental and theoretical studies in the gas phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as in the present study .",
    "moreover , the present study demonstrated that the formation of hdo through the reactions of oh with hd were much less favored than the formation of h@xmath0o , which is inconsistent with their assumptions .",
    "our results are inconsistent with the theoretical predictions for the formation of h@xmath0o and its isotopologues by @xcite , who considered branching ratios of 1 to 1 between reactions ( [ oh+hd->h2o ] ) and ( [ oh+hd->hdo ] ) or between reactions ( [ od+hd->hdo ] ) and ( [ od+hd->d2o ] ) .",
    "the present experimental results demonstrate that a crucial factor for constraining the ratio of the hdo and h@xmath0o abundances formed by reactions listed in table [ tbl-2 ] is the relative abundance of oh and od in dense clouds .",
    "the following three reasons support this conclusion : first , the efficiency of h@xmath0o formation through the reactions of oh with h@xmath0 ( reaction ( [ oh+h2 ] ) ) and hd ( reaction ( [ oh+hd->h2o ] ) ) is comparable to the efficiency of hdo formation through reactions of od with h@xmath0 ( reaction ( [ od+h2 ] ) ) or hd ( reaction ( [ od+hd->hdo ] ) ) .",
    "second , the four reactions ( i.e. , h - atom abstraction reactions ) are much more efficient than the other four reactions ( i.e. , d - atom abstraction reactions ) ( table [ tbl-2 ] , figure [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "third , once solid h@xmath0o is formed , its deuteration does not occur through h ",
    "d exchange with d atoms @xcite or with d@xmath0o @xcite at 10 k , even if d@xmath0o ice forms successfully . note that this prediction is only applicable to hdo and h@xmath0o formation through reactions listed in table [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "if oh and od are mainly produced by the reactions of o atoms with h and d atoms , respectively , the relative abundance of h and d atoms would be important to constrain the relative abundance of oh and od . according to the deuterium fractionation models in the gas phase proposed by @xcite , the atomic d / h ratio is low ( @xmath72 10@xmath73 during the early stages ( @xmath72 10@xmath74 years ) of molecular cloud evolution .",
    "after 10@xmath74 years , the ratio increases dramatically , reaching a value of @xmath750.06 after 10@xmath76 years , which is comparable to the observed hdo / h@xmath0o ratio shown above @xcite .",
    "if large regions of an ice mantle are produced during the later stages of molecular cloud evolution , the hdo / h@xmath0o ratio is expected to reach its highest value for the d / h atomic ratio , @xmath200.06 @xcite . if not",
    ", other routes may contribute to the observed hdo / h@xmath0o ratio .",
    "the above scenario is based on an assumption that oh ( od ) is produced through the reaction o + h ( d ) on grain surfaces . @xcite",
    "estimated the od / oh ratios in their gas - phase model to be 0.0930.358 , higher than the atomic d / h ratio in the same model . the participation of gas - phase od and oh in deuterium fractionation in water formation via surface reactions leads to d enrichment in ice , although the degree of enrichment will depend on the flux of the gas - phase od and oh onto grains",
    "further studies are required to inclusively discuss the formation of solid h@xmath0o and hdo in dense molecular clouds . in future studies",
