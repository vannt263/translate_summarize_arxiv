    "the amplitudes of solar - like oscillations are defined by the balance between excitation and damping .",
    "the oscillations are excited stochastically by the acoustic noise generated by the turbulent motion of the convective elements . in samadi & goupil ( 2001 ,",
    "paperi hereafter ) a theoretical formulation for the acoustic power injected into solar - like oscillations is proposed and which supplements previous theories .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed summary and discussion on some recent unsolved problems .",
    "the excitation process depends on the assumed turbulence spectrum , as discussed , for example , by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it also depends crucially on the convection model to compute the stratification of the convectively unstable layers in the equilibrium model .",
    "the amount of energy injected into the oscillations depends strongly on the velocity of the convective elements .",
    "the main goal of this work is to asses changes in the oscillation power spectrum due to modifications of the convection treatment in the equilibrium model .",
    "we consider two different formulations : the classical description of mixing - length theory by @xcite and a nonlocal generalization of the mixing - length formulation by gough ( 1976 , 1977 ) .",
    "additionally we study the dependence of the oscillation power on the assumed turbulence spectrum in the excitation model for both convection formulations .",
    "the theoretical formulation in paperi involves two free parameters .",
    "these parameters are calibrated such as to reproduce for a solar model the observed acoustic power spectrum ( section  2 ) . in section  3",
    "we compute oscillation power spectra for several stellar models using the two convection formulations .",
    "we conclude that eddington s performance will allow us to distinguish between the two treatments of convection and consequently that eddington will provide further constraints on convection models .",
    "the acoustic power @xmath0 injected into the oscillations is defined ( @xmath1 , @xcite ) in terms of the mode damping rate @xmath2 , the oscillation mean - square amplitude @xmath3 , the mode inertia @xmath4 and oscillation frequency @xmath5 as  : @xmath6    the mean - square amplitude is defined by both the excitation by turbulent convection and by the damping process .",
    "it can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the radial displacement eigenfunction , @xmath9 the density , @xmath10 is the mixing length , @xmath11 the vertical rms velocity of the convective elements ; @xmath12 is a function which includes the second derivative of @xmath13 , and @xmath14 describes the ratio of the excitation by the entropy fluctuations to that by the reynolds fluctuations .",
    "the source functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 describe the contributions from the reynolds and entropy fluctuations , respectively , arising from the smaller scales of the turbulent cascade .",
    "detailed expressions for @xmath17 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are given in paperi .",
    "the source functions include the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum @xmath20 , and the turbulent spectrum of the entropy fluctuations @xmath21 which can be related to @xmath20 by a simple expression ( @xmath22 @xcite , paperii hereafter ) .",
    "both source functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 are integrated first over all eddy wavenumbers @xmath23 , followed by an integration over the stellar mass @xmath24 to obtain the acoustic power @xmath0 ( see eq.[eqn : a2 ] ) .    in the present work , @xmath9 and @xmath11",
    "are obtained from the two equilibrium models , computed with the aforementioned two convection formulations .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath13 and eigenfrequencies @xmath5 are obtained from two different oscillation codes and the @xmath23-dependence of @xmath20 is inferred from different observations of the solar granulation and from theory .",
    "we consider two sets of stellar models : the first set consists of complete models obtained with the cesam evolutionary code in which the convective heat flux is computed according to the classical mixing - length theory by bhm - vitense ( 1958 , c - mlt hereafter ) . the momentum flux ( sometimes referred to as turbulent pressure )",
    "is neglected in this set of models .",
    "the eigenfunctions are obtained from the adiabatic filou pulsation code by @xcite . the detailed input physics used in this set of models",
    "is described in paper  ii .",
    "the second set consists of envelope models computed in the manner of @xcite and @xcite . in these models",
    "convection is treated with the nonlocal mixing - length formulation by gough ( 1976 , g - mlt hereafter ) , which consistently includes the momentum flux ( i.e. , the @xmath25-component of the reynolds stress tensor ) .",
    "the eigenfunctions are obtained from the nonadiabatic pulsation code by @xcite , which includes both the lagrangian perturbations of the heat and momentum fluxes in the manner of @xcite . for both model",
    "sets the mixing length @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the local pressure scale height and @xmath28 the mixing - length parameter , is calibrated first to a solar model to obtain the helioseismically determined depth of the convection zone of @xmath29 solar radii ( @xcite ) .",
    "several turbulent spectra @xmath20 were discussed in paper  ii : the `` nesis kolmogorov spectrum '' ( nks hereafter ) and the `` raised kolmogorov spectrum '' ( rks hereafter ) were suggested from observations of the solar granulation by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "here we also consider the `` broad kolmogorov spectrum '' ( bks hereafter ) by @xcite .",
    "these spectra are depicted in figure [ fig : spc_cinetique ] . for wavenumbers @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the smallest wavenumber of the classical kolmogorov spectrum ,",
    "all spectra follow the classical kolmogorov scaling law , @xmath32 . only in the low - wavenumber range , @xmath33 , where kinetic energy is injected into the turbulent cascade , the spectra exhibit different scaling laws .",
    "these spectra were considered by @xcite to compute acoustic power spectra for various solar - type stars and are also considered in this paper .    from observations of the solar granulation @xcite and @xcite suggest various values for @xmath31 . because of this ambiguity in the choice of @xmath31",
    ", we relate @xmath31 to the mixing length @xmath10 by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a free parameter of order unity ( paperi ) .",
    "another uncertainty in the formulation of the excitation model it the eddy correlation time scale .",
    "because of our still poor understanding of turbulent convection the eddy correlation time scale is not well defined and therefore needs to be scaled , leading to an additional free parameter @xmath36 of order unity ( @xmath1 , @xcite ) . as it was demonstrated in paper",
    "ii the oscillation power computed for the sun depends crucially on the values of the free parameters @xmath36 and @xmath35 .",
    "the mean square surface velocity @xmath37 is related to the acoustic power @xmath38 and the mode damping rate @xmath2 by the expression  : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the radius at which the oscillations are observed .    the acoustic power @xmath0 is computed for the two calibrated solar models using the aforementioned convection formulations . for",

    "discussed in @xcite , the nonlocal formulation ( g - mlt ) predicts smaller temperature gradients in the upper superadiabatic region relative to the c - mlt .",
    "this means that convection is more efficient in models computed with g - mlt which leads to a different profile ( depth - dependence ) of the superadiabatic temperature gradient between the c - mlt and the g - mlt .",
    "the differences in the superadiabatic temperature gradient between the two model sets increase with @xmath46 and @xmath45 .",
    "these results are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmp_gradt ] which shows the superadiabatic temperature gradient @xmath47 versus @xmath48 , with @xmath49 being the radius of the star .",
    "with increasing @xmath46 or @xmath45 , the maximum of @xmath50 is shifted more rapidly to deeper layers for the g - mlt models than for the c - mlt models .",
    "this leads to progressively larger differences in the convective velocities @xmath11 and in the shape of the eigenfunctions between the two sets of models .",
    "these differences in @xmath11 ( note that @xmath0 depends crucially on @xmath11 , see eq.[eqn : a2 ] ) and in the shape of the eigenfunctions are particular large in the superficial layers and result in a larger amount of acoustic power injected into high frequency modes for models computed with the c - mlt .",

    "the increase of the maximum acoustic power with age is found to be larger for models computed with the c - mlt than for the g - mlt models .",
    "we compute @xmath0 for all the kinetic turbulent spectra discussed in section  2.3 .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig : prsep_stars2stars_spc_ce ] for the models c and e. for the set of models computed with the c - mlt ( top panels ) , the dependence of @xmath0 on the assumed turbulence spectra is more pronounced for the hotter model  c than for model  e. this is not observed for the model set computed with g - mlt ( bottom panels ) .",
    "models computed with the c - mlt exhibit a more pronounced decrease of the depth of the surface convection zone with increasing @xmath45 .",
    "this leads to a smaller extend of the excitation region for hotter models compared to the models computed with g - mlt .",
    "as discussed in more detail by samadi et  al .",
    "( 2001b , c ) a shallower excitation region results in a more pronounced frequency - dependence of @xmath0 on the assumed turbulent spectra .",
    "model  c , obtained with g - mlt , exhibit a deeper excitation region and consequently the dependence of @xmath0 on the assumed turbulent spectra is smaller .",
    "this property can be explained by the larger efficacy with which g - mlt transports the convective heat flux .",
    "one of eddington s tasks will be the continuous observation of stellar luminosity oscillations over a time period of 30 days with a frequency accuracy of @xmath51hz ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore the large telescope of eddington ( approximately ten times larger than that of the corot mission ) will lead to a noise level of @xmath52  ppm for stars with a magnitude @xmath53 and for an observing period of 30  days . for comparison",
    ", corot will reach a noise level of @xmath54  ppm ( @xcite ) for stars with a magnitude @xmath55 and for a continuous observing period of 5  days .",
    "will the high - quality observations of the eddington mission be accurate enough to allow us to distinguish between the changes in the predicted oscillation powers @xmath0 of section  3.2 and section  3.3 ? in order to answer this question we estimate the expected accuracy of eddington s measurements of @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite suggested a very simplified scaling law between oscillation amplitude ratios @xmath56 and @xmath45 : @xmath57 assuming adiabatic oscillations in a purely radiative star .",
    "it suggests that the amplitude ratios scale inverse proportionally to the effective temperature ( but see also houdek et  al . , 1999 ,",
    "fig.14 , who found that the amplitude ratios scale directly with @xmath45 ) .    according to eq.([eqn : vs ] ) and eq.([eqn : dl_vs ] ) the relative error for @xmath0 can be expressed as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is obtained from eqs.([eqn : vs ] , [ eqn : dl_vs ] ) .",
