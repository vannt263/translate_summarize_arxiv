    "these notes are based on a course on self - avoiding walks given in bzios , brazil , in august 2010 , as part of the clay mathematics institute summer school and the xiv brazilian probability school .",
    "the course consisted of six lectures by gordon slade , a lecture by hugo duminil - copin based on recent joint work with stanislav smirnov ( see section  [ s : cchex ] ) , and tutorials by roland bauerschmidt and jesse goodman .",

    "this family of probability measures is not consistent as @xmath5 is varied , and thus does not define a stochastic process ; the model is combinatorial in nature .",
    "the natural questions about self - avoiding walks concern the asymptotic behaviour as the length of the paths tends to infinity . despite its simple definition ,",
    "the self - avoiding walk is difficult to study in a mathematically rigorous manner .",
    "many of the important problems remain unsolved , and the basic problems encompass many of the features and challenges of critical phenomena .",
    "this section gives the basic definitions and an overview of the critical behaviour .",
