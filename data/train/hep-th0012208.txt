    "the well - known phase structure of the two - dimensional coulomb - gas was investigated in several papers by using the differential rg approach with a smooth cut - off in the momentum space ( or equivalently using a sharp cut - off in the coordinate space ) ( kosterlitz 1973 , kosterlitz 1974 , jose 1977 , huang 1991 , gersdorff 2000 ) .",
    "our goal is in this work to determine the rg flow for the two - dimensional coulomb - gas in the framework of the rg approach of wegner and houghton ( wegner 1973 ) taking the field - independent wave - function renormalization into account .",
    "results of two different methods were compared : renormalization by means of the blocking construction in the coordinate space using the dilute gas approximation ( real space rg ) ( kosterlitz 1973 , kosterlitz 1974 , jose 1977 , huang 1991 ) , and the renormalization of the equivalent sine - gordon scalar field model , performing the blocking transformations in the momentum space in wegner - houghton s framework with a sharp cut - off and usage of the derivative expansion ( wegner - houghton rg method ) ( wegner 1973 , hasenfratz 1986 , polonyi 2000 ) .",
    "it is believed that several different models , like the sine - gordon , thirring , and the x - y planar models belong to the same universality class , namely to that of the two - dimensional coulomb - gas . the x - y model with external field , which is a classical two - component spin - model described by the action",
    ", @xmath0 has topological excitations , called vortices , which interact via coulomb interaction .",
    "therefore , the x - y model can be mapped by means of the villain - transformation to a coulomb - gas ( huang 1991 ) .",
    "such a mapping is , however , only valid up to irrelevant interaction terms .",
    "the other example , the sine - gordon model in dimension @xmath1 is a one - component scalar field theory with periodic self - interaction , which is defined by the euclidean action : @xmath2.\\ ] ] the equivalence between the x - y model and the lattice regulated compactified sine - gordon model is shown by expressing in terms of the compact variable @xmath3 ( huang 1991 ) .",
    "this makes the kinetic energy periodic and introduces vortices in the dynamics .",
    "there having been made several efforts during the last two decades to improve the coulomb - gas results obtained in the dilute - gas approximation , where the analogy with the electrodynamics of polarizable media has been exploited ( amit 1980 , minnhagen 1985 , kupferman 1997 ) .",
    "here we also show that the method of wegner and houghton applied to the sine - gordon model provides a systematic way of obtaining higher - order corrections to the dilute - gas results .",
    "the real space rg approach for the coulomb - gas in dimension @xmath1 has been investigated in a great detail in the literature ( kosterlitz 1973 , kosterlitz 1974 , jose 1977 , huang 1991 ) .",
    "the dilute vortex gas approximation assumes that all the vortex pairs ( charges ) are separated with at least to the minimum distance @xmath4 in the coordinate space which is increased with infinitesimal steps during the blocking transformation .",
    "the contributions of the order higher than @xmath5 are neglected .",
    "the real space rg equations for the dilute vortex - gas are well - known and their derivation is given in the literature ( kosterlitz 1973 , kosterlitz 1974 , jose 1977 , huang 1991 ) : @xmath6 with the dimensionless coupling constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the differential rg transformations for the sine - gordon model are realized in the momentum space integrating out the high - frequency modes above the moving sharp cut - off @xmath9 sequentially in infinitesimal steps . in the infinitesimal step , corresponding to moving the cut - off @xmath9 to @xmath10 , it is integrated for the high - frequency fourier - modes of the field variable @xmath11 : @xmath12 } = \\int d[\\phi ' ] e^{-s_{k}[\\phi+\\phi']}.\\ ] ] performing the path integral in using the saddle point expansion at @xmath13=0 , the wegner - houghton equation is obtained ( wegner 1973 ) : @xmath14 = -{1\\over2 } tr ' \\log(g_{p p'}^{-1}[\\phi])\\ ] ] with the inverse propagator @xmath15=\\partial^2 s[\\phi]/(\\partial\\phi_p\\partial\\phi_{p'})$ ] and the trace @xmath16 over the momentum shell @xmath17 $ ] . using the derivative expansion in the form @xmath18 $ ] this reduces to : @xmath19 ^ 2   \\left[{4 z^2 k^2\\over d{\\em a}^4 } - { z\\over{\\em a}^3}\\right],\\ ] ] with @xmath20 , the potential @xmath21 , and the field - independent wave - function renormalization @xmath22 .",
    "( [ momentum ] ) are obtained by the method described in ( polonyi 2000 ) .",
    "the flow equations for the dimensionful coupling constants @xmath23 and @xmath24 are obtained by expanding both sides of eqs .",
    "( [ momentum ] ) in fourier series and neglecting the higher harmonics missed on the left hand sides .",
    "it is straightforward to use the derivative of the first equation in with respect to @xmath25 .",
    "thus , we find @xmath26 , \\hspace{1 cm } k\\partial_k z(k ) = - { 1\\over 8\\pi }           { x^2(k ) \\left(1+x^2(k)\\right ) \\over \\left(1-x^2(k)\\right)^{5/2 } } , \\ ] ] with @xmath27 . in order to compare eqs .",
    "one should introduce the dimensionless couplings via @xmath28 and @xmath29 . choosing the moving distance scale according to @xmath30 , we get @xmath31           + 2{\\tilde h } - \\pi t { \\tilde h}^3           { \\left(1 + 8\\pi^2{\\tilde h}^2\\right ) \\over           \\left(1 - 8\\pi^2{\\tilde h}^2\\right)^{5/2 } } , \\\\ \\nonumber a { dt\\over da } & = & - \\pi t^2 { \\tilde h}^2          { \\left(1 + 8\\pi^2{\\tilde h}^2\\right )",

    "( [ real ] ) .",
    "the terms of higher order in @xmath7 yield the infinite series of corrections to the dilute - gas result and are summed up in a closed form on the right hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ dimless ] ) .",
    "in a previous paper ( nandori 1999 ) , using the local potential approximation ( @xmath34 ) , it was shown , that the periodicity and the convexity are so strong constraints on the effective potential @xmath35 that it becomes flat .",
    "this flattening was tested numerically , as well . in order to determine the flow of the blocked potential in next - to - leading order of the derivative expansion",
    ", the flow of the wave - function renormalization @xmath36 should also be obtained .",
    "the rg flow of @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( i.e. @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) , obtained by the above described two different blocking transformations ( real space and wegner - houghton rg ) are qualitatively the same .",
    "the real space rg method ( see eqs . ) yielded the well - known phase - structure for the coulomb - gas , ( see fig .",
    "[ coulomb ] ) that has already been obtained in the literature ( kosterlitz 1973 , kosterlitz 1974 , huang 1991 ) using the dilute gas approximation .",
    "there are two phases connected by the kosterlitz - thouless transition . in the molecular phase the vortices and anti - vortices form closely bound pairs",
    "while in the ionised phase they dissociate into a plasma .",
    "similar results were obtained in ( gersodorff 2000 ) , using momentum space rg with smooth cut - off , without the dilute gas approximation .",
    "the flow diagram for the sine - gordon model obtained by the wegner - houghton rg approach ( see eqs . ) using a sharp momentum cut - off , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ sinegor ] . in order to compare the results obtained by the two different rg methods , four rg trajectories calculated by the real space rg method",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "[ sinegor ] , as well . for small values of @xmath40 and @xmath8 ,",
    "the trajectories for both methods are the same for the same initial conditions . for larger values of @xmath40 the dilute gas approximation , for large values of @xmath8 the villain transformation loose their validity , so that the different rg trajectories belonging to the same initial values start to diverge .",
    "the flow diagram for the sine - gordon model is valid for @xmath41 . at @xmath42",
    "a non - trivial saddle point occurs in the path integral ( [ blocking ] ) and the wegner - houghton equation looses its validity .    in order to investigate the flattening of the blocked potential in next - to - leading order of the derivative expansion also the higher harmonics of the periodic potential should be included .",
    "therefore , the generalization to the field dependent , periodic wave - function renormalization should be performed .",
