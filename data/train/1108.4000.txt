    "the primary mission of the large hadron collider is to uncover the agent of electroweak symmetry breaking and thereby discover the origin of the masses of the elementary particles . in the standard model",

    "three of the scalar degrees of freedom of this particle become the longitudinal states of the electroweak @xmath2 and @xmath3 bosons and the last , the standard model higgs boson ( @xmath4 ) , remains in the spectrum .",
    "recently , both the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations have set limits on the existence of a standard model higgs boson . in this paper",
    "we apply these limits to the  top - higgs \" ( @xmath5 ) expected in topcolor assisted technicolor models and other models with new strong dynamics preferentially affecting the top quark .",
    "topcolor assisted technicolor ( tc2 ) @xcite is a dynamical theory of electroweak symmetry breaking that combines the ingredients of technicolor @xcite and top condensation @xcite .",
    "top condensation and the top quark mass arise predominantly from ",
    "topcolor \" @xcite , a new qcd - like interaction that couples strongly to the third generation of quarks .- quark condensate and , hence , allow for a relatively light @xmath6-quark ; the simplest example @xcite is an extra @xmath7 interaction , giving rise to a topcolor @xmath8 ; other ideas are discussed in @xcite . ]",
    "technicolor then provides the bulk of electroweak symmetry breaking via the vacuum expectation value of a technifermion bilinear .",
    "tc2 is an important potential ingredient in theories of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite . in particular , it is difficult to construct technicolor theories which accommodate the heavy top - quark without also producing large and experimentally forbidden corrections to the ratio of @xmath9- and @xmath3-boson masses @xcite or to the coupling of the @xmath3-boson to bottom - quarks @xcite . by separating the sector responsible for top - quark mass generation from that responsible for the bulk of electroweak symmetry breaking , tc2 alleviates these difficulties .",
    "top - triangle moose \" model @xcite , combining higgsless and topcolor models , is a consistent low - energy effective theory for models with separate sectors for generating the top mass and the vector boson masses .",
    "it can be used to investigate the phenomenology of tc2 theories @xcite and other theories with strong top dynamics , and we employ it in that capacity in this analysis .    as we review below , theories with strong top dynamics generically include a top - higgs state  a state with the same quantum numbers as the standard model higgs boson , a mass of generally less than 350 gev , and a stronger coupling to top - quarks than the standard model higgs has .",
    "we show that the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite searches for the standard model higgs exclude , at 95% cl , a top - higgs with a mass less than 300 gev provided that the associated top - pion states have a mass of at least 150 gev ; even heavier top - higgses are also excluded by the data under certain conditions .",
    "these results constrain model - building in theories with strong top dynamics .",
    "at low energies , any top - condensate model includes the composite weak - doublet scalar boson with the same quantum numbers as the fundamental scalar introduced in the standard model @xcite .",
    "the vacuum expectation value of the composite weak - doublet scalar boson , @xmath10 , combined with the technipion decay - constant of the technicolor theory , @xmath11 , yield the usual electroweak scale @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the weak - interaction fermi constant .",
    "motivated by this relation , we define an angle @xmath14 such that @xmath15 .",
    "three of the degrees of freedom of the composite scalar mix with the states in the technicolor spectrum which are the analogs of the pions of qcd . through the higgs mechanism @xcite ,",
    "one set of linear combinations become the longitudinal states of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the orthogonal combinations , which we denote @xmath16 and @xmath17 , remain in the spectrum and are referred to as  top - pions . \" ignoring ( small ) electromagnetic corrections to their masses , the charged and neutral top - pions are degenerate .",
    "the fourth degree of freedom in the composite scalar , which we denote @xmath5 , is the neutral  top - higgs . \"",
    "the phenomenology of the scalar sector of top - condensate models is determined by the masses of the top - higgs and top - pions , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and the value of @xmath20 .",
    "we consider the range of allowed masses and mixing angles , and the corresponding scalar phenomenology , below .",
    "quantitative analyses of the strong topcolor dynamics @xcite use the nambu  jona - lasinio @xcite ( njl ) approximation to the topcolor interactions , solved in the large-@xmath21 limit @xcite . in this limit",
    ", we find the pagels - stokar relation @xcite for @xmath10 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the cutoff of the effective njl theory , which is expected to be of order a few to tens of tev @xcite , and @xmath24 denotes the portion of the top - quark mass arising from topcolor .",
    "the portion of the top - quark mass arising from technicolor interactions ( more properly , extended technicolor @xcite interactions ) is expected to be less than or of order the bottom - quark mass , and hence @xmath25 @xcite . varying @xmath23 between 1 and 20 tev , we find @xmath26    in the large-@xmath21/njl approximation , we find @xmath27 gev . this relation can be modified via qcd interactions which , in the leading - log approximation ( here @xmath28 ) tend to lower the top - higgs mass @xcite .",
    "in addition , there can be additional ( non leading - log ) corrections coming from interactions in the topcolor theory that are not included in the njl approximation , and also corrections that are subleading in @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , while top - higgs masses less than or of order 350 gev are generically expected in these theories , we will display results for masses between 200 and 600 gev .",
    "the top - higgs couples to top - quarks and to pairs of electroweak bosons , and it does so in a characteristic manner . since topcolor interactions give rise to @xmath24 , the bulk of the top mass , and since the expectation value of the composite weak scalar doublet is @xmath29 , the yukawa coupling of @xmath5 to top - quarks is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the standard model top - quark yukawa coupling .",
    "hence , the top - higgs couples more strongly to top - quarks than does the standard model higgs boson .",
    "this enhanced coupling implies an enhancement for top - higgs production via gluon fusion , relative to the analogous process for the standard model higgs boson @xcite , @xmath32 in contrast , since the bulk of electroweak symmetry breaking is provided by technicolor ( see eq .",
    "( [ weak - scale ] ) ) , the coupling of the top - higgs to vector boson pairs is suppressed relative to the standard model @xmath33 hence the top - higgs vector - boson fusion ( vbf ) production cross section , and the partial width of @xmath5 to vector boson pairs , are also suppressed @xmath34 given that the dominant top - higgs production pathway is enhanced ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : htgg ] ) ) , the suppression of the vector boson fusion pathway is not a major concern .",
    "the crucial issue for the lhc phenomenology of the top - higgs is the branching ratio @xmath35 ) : if this branching ratio is sufficiently large , the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite detectors will be sensitive to the existence of a top - higgs .",
    "as we will now discuss , the branching ratio of the top - higgs to vector bosons , in turn , depends on the mass of the top - pion . unlike the top - higgs mass , the top - pion masses depend on the amount of top - quark mass arising from the ( extended ) technicolor sector , and on the effects of electroweak gauge interactions @xcite .",
    "these masses are therefore more model - dependent .",
    "since top - pions are in the electroweak symmetry breaking sector , we expect them to be lighter than a tev .",
    "top - pions can not be too light , however .",
    "if the charged top - pion @xmath36 were lighter than the top quark , it would potentially appear in top decays , @xmath37 .",
    "the tevatron experiments have searched for this process in the context of two - higgs - doublet models and set upper bounds of about 1020% on the branching fraction of @xmath38 , with @xmath39 decaying to @xmath40 or @xmath41 ( actually , two jets ) @xcite , as the top - pion would also do . the branching ratio @xmath42 @xcite , is and @xmath43 particles present at low - energies in the top - mass generating sector of the theory . ]    @xmath44    where we neglect the bottom - quark mass . from this",
    "we see that , for a given value of @xmath20 , there is a minimum value of @xmath19 such that @xmath45 .",
    "this lower bound on @xmath19 is illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : contourplot ] .",
    "we may now return to the value of @xmath46 , which is crucial for understanding the lhc limits on these models .",
    "if kinematically allowed , the top - higgs will decay predominantly to @xmath47 , @xmath48 , or @xmath49 .",
    "the relevant couplings may be found in @xcite , where we ignore the small model - dependent corrections arising from heavy particles ( see footnote 3 ) . for decays to top - pion plus gauge boson , @xmath50 where @xmath51    \\left [ 1 - \\frac{(m_{\\pi_t } - m_v)^2}{m_{h_t}^2 } \\right].\\ ] ] for decays to two top - pions , @xmath52 where @xmath53.\\ ] ] and for decays to top - quark pairs , @xmath54 by comparison , as we have previously discussed , the width to gauge - bosons is suppressed by @xmath55 @xmath56 ,      \\nonumber \\\\",

    "if all decays are kinematically unsuppressed , and for the mass ranges we consider , a hierarchy of decay widths emerges : @xmath58 in particular , if kinematically allowed , the top - higgs decays predominantly into pairs of top - quarks or top - pions . as we shall see , this implies that lhc searches are particularly sensitive to top - higgs masses less than about 400 gev . for this range of top - higgs masses ,",
    "lhc sensitivity depends crucially on the top - pion masses and whether the top - higgs decays to either a top - pion pair or top - pion plus vector boson is allowed .",
    "lhc searches are most sensitive when these decay modes are suppressed and the @xmath46 is therefore as large as possible .",
    "+        we now turn to the lhc limits on the top - higgs that follow from the recent atlas @xcite and cms @xcite searches for the standard model higgs boson . for the reasons described above",
    ", we consider top - higgs masses ranging from 200 to 600 gev . in this mass range ,",
    "the standard model higgs boson is produced primarily through gluon fusion and secondarily through vector - boson fusion @xcite .",
    "the strongest limits @xcite in this mass range come from searching for the higgs boson decaying to @xmath59 or @xmath1 . in the narrow - width approximation for @xmath5",

    "the sharp drop in the branching ratio occurs when @xmath49 and @xmath48 open near 350 gev .",
    "finally , for @xmath72 gev , again the branching ratio falls sharply above 350 gev as the @xmath49 decay mode opens . since @xmath46 is larger in the regions where @xmath73 , the lhc limits on the top - higgs are substantially stronger for heavier @xmath19 .",

    "this breaks down for sufficiently large @xmath18 and small @xmath20 .",
    "however , as we have seen , in the region where the atlas and cms bounds apply to the top - higgs , the decays to @xmath77 dominate and those to @xmath69 or @xmath48 are kinematically suppressed . for these parameter values",
    "the width of the top - higgs is comparable to that of the standard model higgs , and hence our scaling is valid .    fig .",
    "[ fig : contourplot ] summarizes our results for bounds on the top - higgs in models with strong top dynamics .",
    "the regions shaded very dark blue are completely excluded : on the left , directly from the tevatron bounds and on the right from the lhc searches for the standard model higgs boson .",
    "we see that top - higgs masses of 300 gev or less are excluded at 95% cl for any value of @xmath20 and for @xmath78  gev .",
    "moreover , when the top - pion is heavier than the top quark , all of the generic parameter range in tc2 models ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) is excluded at 95% cl .",
    "in this paper we have used the lhc limits on the standard model higgs boson @xcite to constrain the top - higgs state predicted in many models with new dynamics that couples strongly to top quarks , including topcolor assisted technicolor , top seesaw , and certain higgsless models .",
    "such a state generically couples strongly to top - quarks , and is therefore produced through gluon fusion at an enhanced rate relative to the standard model higgs boson . if the spectrum of the theory allows the branching ratio of the top - higgs to vector boson pairs to be sufficiently high , which happens if the corresponding top - pion is sufficiently heavy , then current lhc searches for the standard model higgs boson exclude the existence of the top - higgs , as summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : contourplot ] .",
    "our results show that the relatively light top - higgs states expected in generic tc2 models are tightly constrained .",
    "moreover , as described in footnote 3 , we have used the effective theory supplied by the top triangle moose to confirm that these conclusions apply broadly to top - condensate models that have only @xmath5 and @xmath43 particles in the low - energy spectrum of the sector responsible for generating the top quark mass .",
    "however , models with top - higgs masses larger than 350 gev are still allowed . in this region , for small @xmath20 ,",
    "the top - higgs becomes a very broad state decaying predominantly into top - quark or top - pion pairs and lhc searches for this state may be difficult . within the context of a tc2 model , however , it would be difficult to reach that region of parameter space . in principle , the non leading - log ( or sub - leading in @xmath81 ) corrections to the njl approximation to the topcolor interactions could shift the top - higgs mass toward substantially larger values .",
    "however , precision flavor and electroweak analyses @xcite prefer larger values of the cutoff @xmath23 and make it unlikely that these effects are large enough to do so .",
    "one avenue to constructing a viable dynamical theory with large @xmath18 might be to pair technicolor with a  top - seesaw \" @xcite sector rather than a topcolor sector @xcite . in a top - seesaw model , condensation of a heavy seesaw",
    "top - partner fermion breaks the electroweak symmetry , thereby severing the link between the top - quark mass and @xmath10 illustrated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tc2-ft ] ) .",
    "because of the increased value of @xmath10 , a seesaw - assisted technicolor theory would feature both larger values of @xmath18 and higher values of @xmath20 than are typical for tc2 .",
    "in fact , just as the top - triangle moose serves as a low - energy effective theory for the top - higgs and top - pion sectors of tc2 in the region of moose parameter space where @xmath10 is relatively small , it may also be viewed as a low - energy effective theory for top - seesaw assisted technicolor when @xmath10 is relatively large .",
    "in essence , a top - seesaw assisted technicolor theory smoothly interpolates between tc2 and the standard model with a heavy higgs boson  a situation that is potentially allowed in the presence of weak isospin violation @xcite .",
    "as additional lhc data is accumulated in the coming months , we anticipate that further searches for signs of a higgs decaying to vector boson pairs will either reveal the presence of a top - higgs or raise the lower bound on its mass . in either case",
