    "the absence of any susy signal at the lhc and the question of the naturalness of the theory has recently led to the consideration of the so - called natural susy models , where only the higgsinos , the stops , the left - handed sbottom , and , to a more limited extent , the gluino , are necessarily light enough to be probed at the lhc  @xcite . higgsino dominance of light neutralinos and charginos in these models could also lead to a small mass difference between the two particles .",
    "such spectra would in turn result in rather characteristic experimental signals in high - energy collisions , including charginos that live long enough to create displaced vertices , or even pass through the detector before decaying , if the mass difference is sufficiently small @xcite .",
    "considerable effort has been invested in searching for such massive metastable charged particles ( mmcps ) , see _",

    ", we investigate how degenerate the lightest neutralino and chargino can be in natural susy models based on the mssm .",
    "we explore to what extent these models are compatible with current collider constraints , and in particular with the discovery of a new boson at the lhc , when interpreted as the light sm - like higgs state of the mssm  @xcite .",
    "this is done by scanning the relevant parameter space using the bayesian inference tool multinest  2.17  @xcite for the analysis of posterior probability distributions .",
    "we find that there is very little room left for degeneracy when requiring that the models are compatible with existing constraints , in particular for a higgsino chargino ",

    "using a bayesian parameter scan , we have explored within the mssm framework to what extent natural susy prefers long - lived charginos , and if it could even harbour a chargino lighter than the lightest neutralino , when confronted with a relatively conservative set of current direct and indirect constraints .",
    "we have also looked at the likely composition of the lsp given the same constraints .",
    "we have shown that the bulk of the posterior probability has chargino  neutralino mass differences above 150200 mev , and that negative mass differences are outside the 95% credible region of natural susy in the mssm .",
    "we note that the latter is a highly non - trivial consequence of the constraints applied , in particular the combination of the lhc higgs mass measurement and a careful conservative consideration of the lep and tevatron constraints on the chargino .",
    "as this preferred mass difference is larger than the pion mass threshold for the decay @xmath97 , we find a corresponding preference for chargino lifetimes below @xmath117  s , meaning that long - lived charginos is not an expected signature of natural susy .",
    "the composition of the lsp is also fairly democratically distributed between bino , wino and higgsino , however , the addition of a dark matter relic density constraint , thus assuming that the lightest neutralino constitutes dark matter , is likely to change this .    in the region of preferred parameter space with the longest chargino lifetimes , the mass degeneracy is due to wino dominance . in this scenario",
    ", the level of degeneracy and thus the chargino lifetime increases for larger values of @xmath25 , until it is dominated by loop - corrections . as a result ,",
    "the parameter region with the longest lifetimes is also a region with relatively high fine - tuning .",
    "current experimental searches by atlas and cms for long - lived particles are starting to exclude this scenario .",
    "should such a long - lived particle be found just beyond current bounds , the conclusion , on the basis of the current paper , must be that it is either a wino , or that natural susy is not realized .    a more natural scenario within natural susy , where the lightest neutralino and chargino are predominantely higgsinos , favours chargino lifetimes below @xmath118  s , and correspondingly chargino  neutralino mass differences above @xmath119  gev .",
    "this scenario is challenging for discovery , but because of the relatively substantial mass difference , compared to the wino case , not impossible , and deserves serious experimental investigation .",
