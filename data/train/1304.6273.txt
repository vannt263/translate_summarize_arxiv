    "recently , there has been renewed interest in the secondary tearing instability of high - lundquist - number current sheets @xcite , called the `` plasmoid instability '' @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations , supported by heuristic scaling arguments @xcite , demonstrate that if the lundquist number ( @xmath0 ) based on the length of the current sheet exceeds a threshold @xcite , the instability breaks up a sweet  parker current layer into a sequence of magnetic islands separated by segments of current sheets , and evolves into a new nonlinear regime of reconnection in which the reconnection rate becomes nearly independent of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these simulation results suggest that there might exist partially reconnected plasmoid solutions of the magnetostatic equilibrium equations in which plasmoids exist , separated by segments of current sheets . in this paper , we show that such solutions can indeed be constructed within the framework of the hahm ",
    "kulsrud  taylor ( hkt ) model , described below .",
    "the hkt model , developed by hahm and kulsrud @xcite following a suggestion by j.  b. taylor , considers the response of a plasma slab with a sheared unperturbed magnetic field to a resonant perturbation applied at the boundaries @xmath1 . in cartesian coordinates @xmath2 the magnetic field @xmath3 is represented as @xmath4 .",
    "the unperturbed `` poloidal '' flux function @xmath5 is @xmath6 , where the constant @xmath7 is the strength of the poloidal magnetic field at the boundary @xmath8 .    in ref .",
    "the `` toroidal '' field @xmath9 was assumed to be effectively constant and much larger than @xmath7 to allow incompressibility to be assumed during a discussion of reconnection dynamics , but in this paper we will be concerned only with finding static equilibrium solutions so this assumption is not necessary .",
    "instead , we regard the @xmath9 profile function @xmath10 in the grad ",
    "shafranov equation as free to choose , and assume it is chosen so that @xmath11 is _ linear _ in @xmath5 , where @xmath12 is the pressure ( and , for si units , @xmath13 is the permeability of free space ) .",
    "this makes the grad ",
    "shafranov equation linear ( though inhomogeneous ) allowing analytic solutions to be obtained .",
    "the perturbed flux function at the boundaries is assumed to be @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a dimensionless parameter measuring the strength of the perturbation , @xmath16 being the amplitude of a notional small boundary ripple of wavelength @xmath17 , the given planar boundary conditions being , to linear order in @xmath18 , equivalent to a symmetric geometric rippling of perfectly conducting bounding walls .",
    "this rippling is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : boundary ] ) , though the value of @xmath19 we use in our standard illustrative case is rather too large for the ripples to be even approximately sinusoidal .",

    "however , on a long enough length scale and a short enough time scale , the intermediate states in the evolution of driven @xcite or spontaneous @xcite magnetic reconnection can be described as a continuous sequence of `` global '' mhd equilibrium states ( i.e. states that satisfy the boundary conditions and internal force balance ) . in the present paper",

    "force balance provides the boundary conditions on the cuts .",

    "hahm and kulsrud @xcite found two _ exact _ mhd equilibrium solutions , one involving a full current sheet covering the plane @xmath25 and one describing a magnetic island with no current sheet .",
    "the current sheet solution may be viewed as representing how a shielding current ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g ) initially arises in order to prevent reconnection after a resonant perturbation is turned on , the magnetic island solution being interpreted as the end state after a sufficient time has elapsed that reconnection has run its course and an island has `` opened . '' in sec .",

    "[ sec : hkgen ] ) being the one with zero net current .",
    "the existence of solutions to the hkt equilibrium problem with either a full current sheet or no current sheet raises the possibility that there may be more solutions , intermediate between the two solutions found in ref .  .",
    "as discussed above , current sheets can be unstable to the formation of plasmoids embedded in the current sheet .",
