    "thus we can obtain the same result for physical quantities by using a pointlike interaction that gives the same scattering length .",
    "a pointlike interaction necessarily leads to ultraviolet divergences from short - distance quantum fluctuations , and they must be cancelled by counterterms . since the counterterms cancel short - distance effects , they correspond to renormalization of the parameters in the action and to renormalization of local operators , such as @xmath66 .",

    "ultraviolet divergences can be avoided by evaluating the partial derivative in the pseudopotential at the appropriate stage of the calculation .",

    "this is small enough that quantum corrections can be treated as small perturbation to the mean - field approximation .",

    "we next quantify the errors from truncating the equation for the density at second order in the gradient expansion .",

    "these corrections are therefore negligible .",
    "the relative importance of quantum corrections that are second order in the gradient expansion increases as one approaches the edge of the condensate , where the gradient expansion breaks down .",

    "we can estimate the magnitude of these corrections by taking the logarithms to be of order 1 .",
    "these corrections are therefore suppressed by two powers of @xmath326 .",
    "there is also an additional suppression factor of @xmath9 , since terms of fourth order in the gradient expansion enter only through quantum corrections .",
