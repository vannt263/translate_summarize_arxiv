    "sandpile models @xcite are one of the simplest examples of avalanche dynamics , a phenomenon of growing experimental and theoretical interest . in these models , grains of `` energy '' ( sand ) are injected into the system , while open boundaries @xcite allow the system to reach a stationary state , in which energy inflow ( a kind of external drive ) and outflow ( dissipation ) balance . in the limit of",
    "infinitely small external driving , the system displays a highly fluctuating , scale - invariant avalanche - like response : the hallmark of criticality .",
    "ten years after the introduction of the first sandpile automaton by bak , tang and wiesenfeld ( btw)@xcite , our understanding of its critical behavior remains frustratingly limited , although several variants of the original model have been studied intensively @xcite . despite some remarkable exact results @xcite , and various renormalization group analyses @xcite , the tempting possibility of assigning these models their proper universality classes remains unfulfilled .",
    "theoretical and numerical difficulties have likewise hampered the precise estimation of critical exponents . only recently was the upper critical dimension @xmath2 established under some assumptions for the avalanche structure @xcite .",
    "originally , sandpile models were proposed as the paradigm of self - organized criticality ( soc)@xcite , i.e. , evolution to a critical state without tuning of parameters .",
    "for this reason , sandpile models were considered for a long time to inhabit a different world than that of standard critical phenomena .",
    "later , several authors pointed out that , in fact , the soc state can be ascribed to the presence of two infinitely separated time scales@xcite .",
    "the two time scales correspond to the external energy input or driving , and the microscopic evolution (  avalanches \" ) .",
    "this time - scale separation ( also called _",
    "slow driving _ ) , effectively tunes the system to its critical point .",
    "what is the relation between critical states due to infinite time - scale separation and regular critical points ?",
    "this question stimulated many theoretical studies aimed at elucidating the links among sandpile automata and models exhibiting nonequilibrium phase transitions , such as systems with absorbing states@xcite , interfaces in disordered media@xcite , the voter model@xcite , and branching processes@xcite .    in order to make the connections with other nonequilibrium phenomena more firm , and to establish universality classes ,",
    "precise critical exponent values are needed .",
    "unfortunately , critical exponents governing the deviation from criticality can not be measured in slowly driven sandpiles , which are posed by definition at their critical point@xcite .",
    "thus correspondences between sandpiles and other nonequilibrium phase transitions can be only partial and inconclusive . in order to overcome this conceptual difficulty , a different approach to sandpiles",
    "has been recently pursued@xcite .",
    "it consists in analyzing sandpiles with _ fixed energy_@xcite , that is , in considering the same microscopic rules that define sandpile dynamics , but without driving and boundary dissipation . in this way",
    "the system is closed and thus the total energy is a conserved quantity , fixed by the initial condition , and can be identified as a ( temperaturelike ) control parameter .",
    "the system turns out to be critical only for a particular value of the energy density ( equal to that of the stationary , slowly driven sandpile ) and it is thus possible to study deviations from criticality .",
    "this approach to sandpiles suggests further analogies with systems with absorbing states@xcite and interfaces in disordered media @xcite .",
    "the stationary state of standard sandpile models is reached through the balance between the input and loss processes , identified by the energy addition and dissipation rates @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "critical behavior is observed in the slow driving regime , in which the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 are tuned to their critical values ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with @xmath7)@xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the system jumps among absorbing configurations ( in which activity is null ) via avalanche - like rearrangements . evidently , in absence of external driving",
    ", any sandpile model can fall into an absorbing configuration .",
    "the connection to absorbing state phase transitions is made more clear by defining _ closed _ , fixed - energy sandpiles in which @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and periodic boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "since the dynamics admits neither input nor loss , the total energy @xmath10 is conserved , and the energy density @xmath11 is a tuning parameter . in this case , if the energy density @xmath0 is large enough , the system reaches a stationary state with sustained activity , i.e. , it is in the _ active _ phase@xcite . on the contrary , for small energy values , the system relaxes with probability one into a frozen configuration , i.e.",
    ", it is in the _ absorbing _ phase .",
    "separating these two regimes is a critical point ( @xmath12 ) with marginal propagation of activity .",
    "once it is appreciated that fixed - energy sandpiles exhibit a continuous transition to an absorbing state , the existence of a critical stationary state in the corresponding driven dissipative sandpile is easily understood .",
    "that is because energy is added only in the absence of activity ( @xmath13 ) while dissipation occurs only in the presence of activity ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "thus @xmath15 is positive for @xmath13 , and vice - versa , leaving @xmath1 as the only possible stationary value for the energy density@xcite .",
    "( the condition that dissipation and hence activity be absent in the subcritical phase makes the absorbing nature of this phase an essential ingredient of soc . )",
    "since soc means tuning a system to its critical point by means of an infinitely slow drive , it is natural to try to understand the critical behavior first in the simpler context of a fixed - energy model .",
    "but while many examples of absorbing - state phase transitions have been studied in detail in recent years , we will see that characterizing sandpile criticality , even in the fixed - energy formulation , is a nontrivial project .    in this paper",
    "we define and study _ fixed - energy sandpiles _ ( fes ) with various microscopic dynamics .",
    "in particular we analyze the btw sandpile @xcite , the stochastic manna model@xcite , and a model with random mixing of a ( real - valued ) energy : the shuffling model @xcite ( full definitions are given in the following section ) .",
    "we show that all of these models exhibit an absorbing - state phase transition at a critical value @xmath1 of the energy density .",
    "what distinguishes the sandpile from other models with absorbing states is that the control parameter @xmath0 represents the global value of a conserved field .",
    "this phase transition is the basis of the critical behavior of driven self - organized sandpiles .",
    "the transition is also studied using mean - field approximations , which yield good qualitative predictions for the order parameter and transition points .",
    "using the insights provided by the connection with absorbing states , we discuss in detail the attempt to construct a field theory for sandpiles@xcite .",
    "the latter is a generalization of reggeon field theory ( rft)@xcite , the minimal continuum theory describing absorbing - state phase transitions@xcite .",
    "we also discuss an alternative approach that considers sandpiles from the perspective of linear interface models ( lim ) in disordered media@xcite .",
    "since continuum descriptions have proved to be of fundamental importance in understanding universality and critical behavior , we analyze in detail open questions and possible improvements of these theoretical approaches .    for all the models mentioned , we report results of simulations close to the critical point , and discuss them in terms of universality classes .",
    "numerical results indicate three distinct critical behaviors , depending upon the microscopic dynamics of models .",
    "in particular , the btw model defines a critical behavior _",
    "per se _ , related to the deterministic nature of the dynamics .",
    "we find striking evidence of non - ergodicity in the btw fes : an anomalous transient to the stationary state , and lack of self - averaging .",
    "stochastic automata , such as the manna model , have a critical behavior that is rather close to the one of linear interface depinning models .",
    "finally , the shuffling model shows a critical behavior that could be compatible with the rft universality class .",
    "however , the nonlocal dynamics of this model merits a detailed examination .",
    "it is also important to note that all models show a violation of certain scaling relations usually associated with absorbing - state phase transitions .",
    "this seems to point out the particular role of the conserved field in these systems .",
    "finally , we discuss the numerical results in the perspective of the theoretical frameworks mentioned above .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : after defining the models in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the generalized rft theory ( sec .",
    "iii ) and lim approach ( sec .",
    "iv ) to fes models .",
    "we analyze from a critical perspective the approximations and hypotheses involved in these approaches . in particular , we discuss the nature of the different noise terms ; this turns out to be essential to the identification of universality classes . in sec .",
    "v we present the results of extensive simulations in two dimensions , and analyze them in the perspective of absorbing - state transitions @xcite , and the lim mapping , which focuses on the roughness of a suitably defined interface @xcite .",
    "we find differences between btw , manna and fully stochastic fes exponents that persist upon enlarging the system size .",
    "vi is concerned with the origins of these differences and possible improvements in the theoretical descriptions to capture the true critical behavior of fes models .",
    "a brief summary is provided in sec .",
    "mean - field theory approaches at the one- and two - site levels are described in the appendix .",
    "in this paper we consider three different sandpile models . all",
    "are defined on a @xmath16-dimensional hypercubic lattice ( @xmath17 in this study ) ; the configuration is specified by giving the _ energy _",
    ", @xmath18 , at each site .",
    "the energy may take integer or real values , depending on the model , but is nonnegative in all cases .",
    "the specific models are defined as follows .",
    "_ btw model _",
    "@xcite : each active site , i.e. , with ( integer ) energy greater than or equal to the _ activity threshold _",
    "@xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , topples at unit rate , i.e. , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 at each of the @xmath23 nearest neighbors of @xmath24 .",
    "the toppling rate is introduced in order to define a markov process with finite transition rates between configurations that differ at a small number of sites .",
    "the next site to topple is selected at random from the set of active sites ; this is the only stochastic element in the dynamics .",
    "( the initial configuration is , in general , random as well . )",
    "the btw dynamics with _",
    "parallel _ updating ( all active sites topple at each update ) is completely deterministic , and it has been possible to obtain many exact results for the driven sandpile in this case , due to the abelian property@xcite .",
    "this property implies that the order in which active sites are updated is irrelevant in the generation of the final ( inactive ) configuration .",
    "accordingly , it is reasonable to expect that sequential or parallel updating does not affect the qualitative behavior .",
    "the btw model is the prototypical sandpile model , and has been the subject of extensive numerical studies @xcite . despite the huge numerical effort devoted to the analysis of its critical behavior , the model presents scaling anomalies which have precluded a definitive characterization .",
    "the scattered numerical values of the avalanche critical exponents were recently interpreted in terms of multiscaling properties @xcite .",
    "_ manna sandpile _",
    "@xcite : in this case @xmath25 regardless of the number of dimensions ; the energy is again integer - valued .",
    "the two particles liberated when the site @xmath24 topples move _ independently _ to randomly chosen nearest neighbors @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( that is , @xmath28 with probability @xmath29 ) @xcite .",
    "this model has a stochastic dynamics , which still enjoys a `` stochastic '' abelian property , as shown recently by dhar @xcite .",
    "the manna model has also been the subject of many numerical studies .",
    "together with the btw model , it has been at the center of the long debate over universality classes for ( driven ) sandpiles @xcite , that we will discuss in later sections .",
    "the manna model , fortunately , has a regular scaling behavior .",
    "the most recent analyses provide a coherent picture of its critical properties and exponent values@xcite .",
    "_ shuffling model_@xcite : this model has nonnegative real - valued energies .",
    "when a site @xmath24 topples , the energy @xmath30 at that site and its nearest neighbors is redistributed randomly amongst these five sites .",
    "that is , we generate random numbers @xmath31 , uniform on [ 0,1 ] , and let @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "sites with energy @xmath34 topple with probability one .",
    "in addition , the nearest neighbors of the toppling site that have energy @xmath35 also become active with probability @xmath36 .",
    "this model contains stochasticity in each ingredient of the dynamics , and for this reason can be considered a fully stochastic model .",
    "it is clearly non - abelian : the final configuration depends dramatically upon the order in which sites are updated .",
    "the parallel - updating version studied in this work exhibits an interesting nonlocal dynamical effect . at each update",
    ", the energy around a site is shuffled among nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "if a nearest - neighbor ( or next - nearest neighbor ) pair of sites are both active , the energy at a certain site or sites will be shuffled twice within a single time step . for larger aggregates of active sites",
    ", the reshuffling may involve the same site several times .",
    "in particular , energy can be transported over large distances by consecutive shuffling events along the front of active sites .",
    "this non - locality will create a mixing effect in the energy transport that one expects to influence the critical behavior .",
    "in the present paper , we study the manna and shuffling models with the parallel updating customarily used in sandpile automata .",
    "the btw model is implemented using random sequential dynamics , with each active site having a toppling rate of unity .",
    "the next site to topple is chosen at random from a list of active sites , which must naturally be updated following each toppling event .",
    "the time increment associated with each such event is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the number of active sites .",
    "this is the mean waiting - time to the next event , if we were to choose sites blindly , instead of using a list .",
    "( in this way , @xmath38 sites topple per unit time , just as in a simultaneously updated version of the model . )",
    "since the btw model is abelian , the choice of updating ( parallel versus sequential ) should be irrelevant to the asymptotic critical properties .",
    "this has been tested in independent simulations using parallel dynamics@xcite .    in a fes ,",
    "the energy density @xmath0 is fixed in the initial condition .",
    "the latter is generated by distributing @xmath39 particles randomly among the @xmath40 sites , yielding an initial ( product ) distribution that is spatially homogeneous and uncorrelated . once the particles have been placed the dynamics begins .",
    "the condition to have at least one active site in the initial configuration is trivially satisfied on large lattices , for the @xmath0 values of interest , i.e. , close to the critical value .",
    "( for large @xmath41 , the initial height at a given site is essentially a poisson random variable , and the probability of having no active sites is exponentially decreasing with the lattice size ) .",
    "it is worth remarking that while the initial conditions are statistically homogeneous , the energy density is not perfectly smooth . for @xmath42 ,",
    "the energy density on a set of @xmath43 sites is essentially a gaussian random variable with mean @xmath0 and variance @xmath44 .",
    "the initial value of the critical - site density @xmath45 ( sites that become active upon receiving energy ) , moreover , is generally far from its stationary value , complicating relaxation to the steady state .",
    "if after some time the system falls into a configuration with no active sites , the dynamics is permanently frozen , i.e. , the system has reached an absorbing configuration .",
    "we shall see that as we vary @xmath0 , fixed - energy sandpiles show a phase transition separating an absorbing phase ( in which the system always encounters an absorbing configuration ) , from an active phase possessing sustained activity @xcite .",
    "this is a continuous phase transition , at which the system shows critical behavior .",
    "the order parameter is the stationary average density of active sites @xmath46 , which equals zero for @xmath47 , and follows a power law , @xmath48 , for @xmath49 .",
    "the correlation length @xmath50 and relaxation time @xmath51 both diverge as @xmath52 ; their critical behavior is characterized by the exponents @xmath53 and @xmath54 , defined via @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "the dynamical critical exponent is defined via @xmath57 , which implies @xmath58 .",
    "the exponents @xmath59 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 define the stationary critical behavior at the absorbing - state phase transition @xcite . in the vicinity of the critical point , where @xmath50 is very large ,",
    "the actual characteristic length of the system is the lattice size @xmath41 .",
    "we shall see that the application of finite - size scaling allows us to locate the critical point as well as estimate critical exponents .",
    "in this section we discuss a recently proposed phenomenological field theory of sandpiles @xcite .",
    "our main goal is to clarify the connection between fixed - energy sandpiles and reggeon field theory ( rft ) , which is the minimal field theory describing absorbing - state phase transitions@xcite ( whose prototypical examples are directed percolation ( dp)@xcite and contact processes ( cp)@xcite ) .    in ref",
    ".  @xcite we proposed a langevin description for sandpiles by considering the mean - field description of sandpiles reported in ref.@xcite , and introducing spatial dependence and fluctuations .",
    "this allows a derivation that is based on the microscopic dynamics of sandpile automata , but involves several approximations .    here",
    "we show how to write down a general langevin description of sandpiles by using very general symmetry considerations .",
    "this results in a complete description , but one that is not easy to deal with , unless the proper approximations are introduced .",
    "after the introduction of some specific assumptions regarding noise terms , we recover the results of ref .  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the present more general treatment indicates possible modifications that may be needed for a complete characterization of sandpile models .    in sandpiles ,",
    "the order parameter is @xmath46 , the density of active sites ( i.e. , whose height @xmath60 ) @xcite ; if at a given time @xmath61 for all * x * , the system has reached an absorbing configuration .",
    "the only dynamics in the model is due the field @xmath62 , which is coupled to the local energy density , @xmath63 , which enhances or depresses the generation of new active sites@xcite .",
    "we therefore consider the dynamics of the local order - parameter field @xmath64 in a coarse - grained description , bearing in mind that the energy density @xmath63 is a _ conserved _ field .",
    "note that both @xmath64 and @xmath63 are nonnegative .",

    "conservation is enforced by the @xmath68 term and the standard form of conserving noise , as for example in cahn - hilliard - type equations @xcite",
    "( @xmath69 is a @xmath16-component vectorial noise ) .",
    "the dynamical equation for the density of active sites can be written analogously as @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are functionals of @xmath46 and @xmath0 and @xmath73 is an uncorrelated gaussian noise .",

    "the right - hand - sides of eq.s  ( [ conservation ] ) and ( [ act1 ] ) must vanish when @xmath77 ( if they did not , the state @xmath77 would not be absorbing ! ) .",

    ", we have to consider the symmetry of the lattice in question . for isotropic models the system is inversion - symmetric under @xmath86 , so that odd powers of gradients , such as @xmath87 , are forbidden .",

    "this implies the knowledge of the noise term , i.e. , we have to decide the terms to retain in @xmath72 and @xmath67 .",
    "the most relevant term is the linear one , corresponding to @xmath92 @xcite . in rft",
    ", the rationale for the noise variance being proportional to the local order parameter is that the numbers of elementary ( birth and death ) events in a given space - time cell are poissonian random variables , so the variance is equal to the expected value . that the noise term for sandpile models has the same form as in rft is by no means guaranteed .",
    "for instance , the btw model is fully deterministic , and the nontrivial assumption that at the coarse - grained level it is described by a time - dependent noise should be tested .",
    "further , the fact that the field @xmath63 is conserved could affect the noise form .",

    "let us present here some comments on these two extra terms .",
    "_ quenched disorder _ : in the absence of the memory term , and for generic initial conditions , @xmath119 , eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) is the field theory of directed percolation with _ quenched disorder_. disorder is known to be a relevant perturbation in dp below @xmath120 @xcite . on the other hand , the memory and spatially - dependent linear terms _ together _ represent coupling to the energy density , which is not quenched - in , but relaxes via the diffusion of activity [ see eq .",
    "( [ quench ] ) ] .",
    "thus the effect of a spatially - dependent @xmath97 , in the present context , is not that of quenched disorder .",
    "in fact , we expect the physical effects of quenched disorder , and the present coupling to a conserved energy density ( frozen only in the absence of activity ) , to be quite different@xcite .",
    "a handwaving argument to justify this assertion is the following : in the active stationary state , close to the critical point , activity will tend to be localized at any given moment , and a given point * x * will experience bursts of activity interspersed amongst dormant intervals .",
    "as activity alternately enters and vanishes from the neighborhood of * x * , the positive and negative contributions to the laplacian memory term in eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) will largely cancel , and so this term will be dominated by the most recent changes in the state of the region .",
    "thus the initial spatial variation in @xmath121 will effectively be forgotten in the stationary state . another way to see",
    "this is to note that the effects of quenched disorder are found in a _ non - markovian _ version of the contact process @xcite ( using the so - called  run - time statistics \" ) in which the creation rate at site @xmath24 is @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is a parameter , and @xmath124 represents the number of creation events out of @xmath125 total events at site @xmath24 , up to time @xmath126 .",
    "evidently , sites which by chance have enjoyed a larger fraction of creation events in the past are likely to continue to do so , mimicking a quenched random creation rate . in the present case , the effective creation rate ( @xmath127 ) is @xmath128 .",
    "now , regions with @xmath46 larger than @xmath129 tend to have @xmath130 .",
    "thus the non - markovian term provides a stabilizing , negative feedback on the creation rate . regions currently experiencing above - average activity will be harder to excite in the near future .",
    "( note however , that @xmath131 is time independent , since @xmath132 . )",
    "while the non - markovian term effectively erases the initial distribution @xmath133 , we do expect the spatial dependence of @xmath97 to play an important role when we consider avalanches , i.e. , the spread of activity from a localized seed , in a nonuniform energy density .",
    "_ non - markovian term _ : as we have just discussed , this term enables the theory to forget the quenched , stochastic reproduction rate @xmath121 .",
    "naively , its associated coefficient , @xmath104 , has the same dimensionality as @xmath107 and @xmath134 , which are the two marginal parameters of rft at its upper critical dimension , @xmath2 .",
    "below @xmath110 we expect the critical fixed point to be renormalized to @xmath135 , defining a renormalized @xmath1 and nontrivial critical exponents .",
    "if the non - markovian term is irrelevant , the field theory would be governed at criticality by the rft fixed point . in @xmath17",
    "the rft critical behavior is characterized by @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138@xcite .",

    "( [ main ] ) , and their implications for critical behavior , will be discussed in later sections .",
    "finally , a microscopic derivation of the field theory would ensure that the conservation symmetry has been properly taken into account in the present phenomenological approach .",
    "a connection between sandpiles and interfaces moving in disordered media can be obtained by defining a variable @xmath139 that counts the number of topplings ( instances of activity ) at site @xmath24 up to time @xmath126 .",

    "let us note that a nonzero interface velocity is only possible if active sites are present in the system ; equivalently we can notice that @xmath142 , so in either representation the dynamically active phase is restricted to the regime with nonvanishing @xmath143 . in this way it is evident that pinned ( unpinned ) and absorbing ( active )",
    "states are just two ways of looking at the same physical situation .",
    "the connection between driven sandpiles and interfaces was first proposed by narayan and middleton and by paczuski and boettcher @xcite and recently generalized by lauritsen and alava @xcite who provided a direct mapping between the btw model and a linear interface with quenched disorder . in the following",
    "we adapt their approach to fixed - energy sandpiles .",
    "let @xmath144 be the number of topplings at site @xmath24 up to time @xmath126 , and @xmath145 the energy at @xmath24 at time @xmath126 .",

    "if the caveat noted above regarding the replacement @xmath163 turns out to be unimportant , then the transition should show the same scaling properties as depinning in the edward - wilkinson equation with columnar noise .",
    "how are these results changed for the manna model ? for the outflow at site @xmath24 we now have @xmath164 , since only two particles are transferred in each toppling event .",

    "this is analogous to the langevin description of the previous section .",
    "we caution however that this analogy does not imply that it is easy , or even possible , to translate equations or results from one language to the other .",
    "for example , to the best of our knowledge , no one has succeeded in writing down an interface - like equation equivalent to rft@xcite .    from a numerical point of view",
    "it is possible to measure various exponents characterizing the behavior of moving interfaces .",

    "it is worth remarking that this nonergodicity is consistent with the existence of toppling invariants @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ btw9 ] , for example , we show the evolution of @xmath46 for five different initial configurations ( ics ) in a system with @xmath332 , at @xmath1 .",

    "the data indicate , however , that the probability distribution for @xmath334 ( i.e. , the order parameter normalized to its mean value ) , does not become sharp as @xmath279 , as it would , for example , in directed percolation .",
    "further evidence of nonergodicity is found in the activity autocorrelation function , defined as    @xmath335    where @xmath336 is the number of active sites at time @xmath126 , and @xmath337 stands for an average over times @xmath338 _ in the stationary state _ for a given ic , as well as an average over different ics .",
    "the autocorrelation function for the critical btw fes ( @xmath332 , average over 2000 ics and @xmath339 time units ) , shown in fig .",

    "( changing the seed for the random choice of toppling sites changes @xmath342 only slightly , if we maintain the same ic @xcite . ) evidently , @xmath342 decays rapidly to zero when we average over initial conditions because of dephasing amongst oscillatory signals with varied frequencies .",
    "interestingly , the interface width @xmath261 shows much less dependence on the ic than does the active - site density or its autocorrelation .    in summary , the btw fixed - energy sandpile shows signs of the kind of scaling found at simpler absorbing - state phase transitions , but at the same time exhibits dramatic nonergodic effects .",
    "we note unusually strong finite - size effects , which prevent us from determining certain critical exponents precisely . whether this is a simple finite - size effect or a signature of multiscaling can not be ascertained definitively with the present data .",
    "the shuffling model@xcite has a continuously variable control parameter , since each site has a ( non - negative ) real - valued energy .",
    "thus we are no longer constrained to vary the energy density @xmath0 in increments of @xmath346 as we are in discrete models ( e.g. , the manna and btw fes ) , where the single grain is the smallest energy unit . in the shuffling fes ,",
    "all sites whose energy exceeds the threshold @xmath347 are considered active . in addition , sites that have received energy from a toppling nearest neighbor can become active if @xmath348 with a probability @xmath349 .",

    ". this could be a signal that the system has not yet reached its asymptotic temporal behavior for the sizes considered ( @xmath365 ) . that the relaxation could be affected by strong finite - size effects is confirmed by the temporal scaling of @xmath366 . in fig .",
    "[ shuffle3 ] we observe that the active - site density decay does not follow a definite power law before reaching the stationary state .",
    "this makes impossible an accurate determination of the exponent @xmath260 ( @xmath367 ) , which is also reflected in the absence of a clear data collapse for the temporal scaling functions .",
    "the roughness analysis is affected by several numerical problems .",
    "the short average lifetime of trials at finite size makes it impossible to reach the width - saturation regime .",
    "this effect is even more pronounced than in the manna case .",

    "iv , and using the dynamical exponent obtained previously , we have @xmath369 .",
    "however , in this case the short - time behavior of the roughness appears to have a size dependence , probably due to the lack of complete convergence to the asymptotic scaling behavior , and the numerical values provided here could contain systematic errors that are difficult to estimate .    in summary , the numerical results for the shuffling fes model show also the signature of a continuous phase transition from an absorbing to an active phase .",
    "the stationary properties of the model show well defined scaling behavior at the system sizes considered in the present study .",
    "the dynamic scaling properties , by contrast , show anomalies and transient effects that could indicate that the system has not yet attained its asymptotic behavior for @xmath370 .",

    "@xmath134 can be calculated by noting that the scaling of an avalanche due to a point seed scales as the total variation of the field @xmath139 , which represents the total number of topplings .",

    "in this case we also see a very good agreement between independent measurements .",
    "more subtle is the case of the btw model . here",
    "different simulations of the driven sandpile give rather scattered results .",
    "a very recent analysis suggesting multiscaling in the ( driven ) btw sandpile indicates that neither @xmath134 nor @xmath177 are clearly defined@xcite . in particular",
    ", the effective value of @xmath134 increases as one studies higher moments , and saturates at @xmath389 .",
    "this is indeed the result we recover from our analysis ( @xmath390 ) .",

    "this a particularly vexing problem , that has eluded ten years of theoretical and numerical efforts .",
    "soon after the introduction of sandpile models with modified dynamical rules , there were many quests for the precise identification of universality classes .",
    "in particular btw and manna models , which are prototypes for deterministic and stochastic models , respectively , have been the objects of a longstanding quarrel over their supposed universality classes@xcite .",
    "the first numerical attempts showed very similar exponents for the avalanche distributions@xcite , but the results were afflicted by severe finite - size errors due to the limited sizes attainable using the cpu power available at that time .",
    "these results were later questioned by ben - hur and biham@xcite , who analyzed the scaling of conditional expectation values of various quantities related to avalanches .",
    "these results were , however , biased by the unexpected singular behavior of the distributions@xcite , and have been recently reconsidered by applying other numerical methods @xcite . from the theoretical standpoint it is very surprising that small modifications of the microscopic dynamics would lead to different universality class .",
    "however , no analytical demonstration of distinct universality classes in sandpiles has been presented up to now . on the contrary , many theoretical arguments in favor of a single universality class can be found in the literature@xcite .    in table",
    "[ exps ] we summarize the critical exponents found for each model .",
    "the quoted values indicate , beyond numerical uncertainties , that the models discussed here belong to three distinct universality classes .",
    "striking differences appear between the btw and the manna model . beyond the numerical values of critical exponents ,",
    "we observe for the first time the lack of self - averaging in the btw fes .",
    "this property is related to its deterministic dynamics , and finds consistent analogies in the waves of toppling description@xcite",
    ". the lack of self - averaging could also be the origin of the multiscaling features recently observed by de menech et al.@xcite in the driven btw sandpile . from this discussion",
    "it appears that the introduction of stochasticity is a relevant modification for the critical behavior . at this point",
    "it is worth noting that the manna model has been considered for a long time as a non - abelian model .",
    "the opposite has been pointed out recently by dhar@xcite , by means of rigorous arguments . the conjecture that manna and btw sandpiles belong to different universality classes because the former is non - abelian has then to be abandoned .",
    "per se _ , however , does not define a unique universality class , as evidenced by the distinct critical properties of the manna and shuffling fes models . the origin of the different behavior can be traced to the nonlocal nature of the shuffling model dynamics , as we shall make clear later .    in summary ,",
    "our numerical results are in good agreement with the most recent measurements of driven sandpiles , confirming that the two cases share the same critical behavior .",
    "in addition , the fes framework enlarges the set of exponents that can be measured , providing new tools for the characterization of critical behavior and universality classes in different models .      in order to compare the exponents",
    "found in fixed - energy simulations with the usual avalanche exponents @xmath391 and @xmath392 , we relied on scaling relations .",
    "however , avalanches can also be studied in the fes case , in simulations of critical `` spreading '' .",
    "let us first define what is a spreading experiment in a system with an absorbing - state@xcite . in such experiments ,",
    "a small perturbation ( a single active site , for instance ) is created in an otherwise frozen ( absorbing ) configuration . in the supercritical regime",
    ", the ensuing activity has a finite probability to survive indefinitely , reaching the stationary state deep inside the ( growing ) active region . in the subcritical regime",
    ", activity will decay exponentially . in each spreading sequence , it is customary to measure the spatially integrated activity @xmath393 , averaged over all runs , and the survival probability @xmath237 after @xmath126 time steps . at the critical point separating the supercritical and subcritical regimes , these quantities have a singular scaling : @xmath394 and @xmath395 , where @xmath74 and @xmath396 are called spreading exponents .",
    "if we can define the substrate over which the activity spreads uniquely , this spread of activity is the same as an avalanche in a sandpile model@xcite .",
    "sandpile models , however , have infinitely many absorbing configurations . in the infinite - size limit ,",
    "an infinite number of energy landscapes correspond to the same value @xmath0 .",
    "( for real - valued energies , as in the shuffling model , this infinite degeneracy already appears for finite systems . ) in this case spreading properties at a given value of the control parameter @xmath0 will depend on the initial configuration in which the system is prepared .",
    "it is even possible to observe nonuniversality in the spreading exponents , a feature that sandpiles share with the pair contact process ( pcp)@xcite and other systems with infinitely many absorbing configurations@xcite .    in order to have well defined spreading exponents ( that can be related to the avalanche exponents of a driven sandpile )",
    ", we have to define uniquely the properties of the energy landscape for spreading experiments .",
    "one possibility is to use the absorbing configurations generated by the fixed - energy sandpile itself for initial configurations .",
    "suppose we use such a configuration for a spreading experiment , by introducing an active site . repeating this process many times , we obtain the spreading properties for so - called `` natural absorbing configurations''@xcite .",
    "a second option is to use the substrate left by each spreading process as the initial condition for the subsequent one . after a transient time",
    "the system will flow to a stationary state with well defined properties , in which each initial configuration is a `` natural configuration '' .",
    "on the other hand , this second definition of a spreading experiment is identical to slow driving , except that energy is strictly conserved ( the active site must be generated by a mechanism that does not change the energy)@xcite .    by performing spreading experiments close to @xmath1 , it is possible to obtain directly the avalanche and spreading scaling behavior , as well as the divergence of characteristic lengths approaching the critical energy . a preliminary study in this direction for the btw model confirms the uniqueness of the critical behavior at @xmath1@xcite .",
    "interesting results have also been obtained for the spreading properties in a fes mean field model@xcite .",
    "a more complete study of spreading exponents in a variety of sandpile models is a promising path toward the complete characterization of their critical behavior .      in earlier sections we presented two alternative theoretical descriptions for sandpile models .",
    "we compare our numerical results with theoretical predictions in order to assess the validity of these theoretical frameworks , and the eventual improvements needed for a complete description of sandpile models .    in sec .",
    "iii we introduced a langevin description that takes into account the absorbing nature of the phase transition in fes models .",
    "unfortunately , a rigorous derivation of the noise terms has not yet been made .",
    "the assumption of rft - like noise terms leads to the langevin description of eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) .",
    "this differs from the standard dp langevin description for the presence of a non - markovian term . only in the case",
    "that this term is irrelevant the theory belongs to the universality class of rft . from a physical point of view",
    "this means that the local coupling between the activity field @xmath64 and the energy field @xmath63 is irrelevant on large scales . in other words",
    "the activity spreads on an effective average energy substrate whose only role is to tune the spreading probability .",
    "this is indeed the same as a dp problem in which the critical parameter is tuned via the average energy @xmath0 .    casting a glance at our numerical results ,",
    "the only model that has exponents compatible with the dp universality class is the shuffling fes .",
    "this is not unexpected ; the model was indeed proposed by maslov and zhang@xcite as a sandpile realization of directed percolation . at the basis of this behavior",
    "is nonlocal energy transport . as we emphasized in sec .",
    "ii , the shuffling model allows the transfer of the same parcel of energy several times in the same time step .",
    "this introduces , on average , a strong mixing effect that makes energy diffusion slower . in this way",
    "the spread of activity is effectively decoupled from the local fluctuations that the activity itself generates in the energy field . on the other hand , maslov and",
    "zhang @xcite noted that in @xmath203 , the nonlocal energy mixing is not capable of destroying correlations and , following a transient , the model exhibits non - dp scaling . while the exponents summarized in tab .",
    "[ exps ] are compatible with the dp universality class , we note that the dynamic scaling properties of the shuffling model show systematic biases that could signal a nonasymptotic behavior for some observables .",
    "we can not therefore exclude completely that the model is still in a transient regime , that could finally lead to a different critical behavior , as happens in @xmath203 .",
    "the manna and btw fes models , by contrast , exhibit critical exponents different from those of dp . in these models ,",
    "the energy redistribution during toppling is strictly local , and the spread of activity is always correlated with the energy fluctuations generated during toppling processes .",
    "it is then reasonable to expect that a langevin theory has to take into account fully the non - markovian term",
    ". it may be also possible to derive the pertinent stochastic equations and the noise correlations applying more rigorous treatments , as in ref  @xcite .",
    "the moving interface picture is also afflicted by our ignorance of the correlations between the quenched noise terms appearing in the equations ( see sec .",
    "iv ) . by suitable approximations",
    "it has been shown that the manna model could belong to the lim universality class .",
    "our numerical results show that the stationary critical properties are compatible with this universality class .",
    "the dynamic properties , however , show anomalies that are not compatible with lim .",
    "the origin of these anomalies deserves a more accurate analysis , and might be understood if we had a better grasp of the noise terms in the interface representation .",
    "it is interesting , in this context , that the btw model , for which the mapping to the interface representation seems most straightforward , defines a universality class _ per se _ , incompatible with linear interface depinning with columnar disorder .",
    "this is probably due to the strong nonlinearity introduced by the local velocity constraint implicit in the @xmath158-function of eq .",

    "while neither theoretical approach allows an exact characterization of sandpile models , they appear to be conceptually very relevant , because they provide an answer to the basic questions of why driven sandpile models show soc .",
    "the genesis of self - organized criticality in sandpiles is a continuous absorbing - state phase transition .",

    "viewed in this light ,  self - organized criticality \" refers neither to spontaneous or parameter - free criticality , nor to self - tuning .",

    "of specific models , and whether these can be grouped into universality classes , as for conventional phase transitions both in and out of equilibrium . in this respect ,",
    "the theoretical approaches presented here show a very promising path of improvements and modifications that could lead to the solution of many of these questions .",

    "the results of extensive simulations , which are in good agreement ( via scaling laws ) , with previous studies of driven sandpiles , place the three models in distinct universality classes .",
    "results for the manna fes are consistent with the universality class of linear interface depinning , while the shuffling fes appears to follow directed percolation scaling .",
    "both these assignments , however , are somewhat provisional , due to dynamic anomalies and apparent strong finite - size effects .",
