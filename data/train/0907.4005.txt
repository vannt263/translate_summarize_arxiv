    "perturbation acceleration represents disturbing force which disturbs keplerian motion .",
    "disturbing force causes time change of orbital elements describing actual orbit of a body in space . to describe the orbit of the body in space we can use different sets of orbital elements .",
    "we will use the following set of orbital elements : semi - major axis @xmath0 , eccentricity @xmath1 , inclination @xmath2 , argument of perihelion @xmath3 , longitude of ascending node @xmath4 and angle @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is mean motion and @xmath7 is time of perihelion passage .",
    "perturbation equations can be expressed using different methods . using lagrange method it is possible to derive perturbation equations which use scalar product of disturbing acceleration and partial derivative of position vector with respect to orbital elements .",
    "another method is to derive perturbation equations directly from radial , transversal and normal components of disturbing force .",
    "we show that the expression obtained by lagrange method enables to derive the expression through radial , transversal and normal components of the disturbing force .",
    "attempts to show the existence of this connection can be found in brown ( 1896 ) .",
    "brown uses an alternate set of orbital elements and his equations contain several trivial errors .",
    "using lagrange brackets , we can derive the following time derivatives of orbital elements defined in previous section ( see , e. g. , brouwer and clemence 1961 ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a disturbing acceleration and @xmath10 is a position vector of a particle with respect to the sun .",
